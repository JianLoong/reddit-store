If so, are you on board with that? \n\nBefore attempting to get pregnant those are things you need to discuss and set boundaries/limits on.", "NTA.  Naming a child is a big deal and assigning a name that will potentially affect the child in a negative or unintended way needs to be heeded.  Your offer of using it as a middle name is generous and hopefully one your husband will be able to eventually embrace.", "NTA  Doesn't he realize there are 2 of you as parents, No one gets to choose a child's name without  input from the other parent unless that parent disappears.  I would tell him there will be no children until he can compromise..", "NTA Giving your child a religious based name will be a burden on them and they'll likely use a nickname to avoid it growing up. You should both agree on whatever name is chosen. He doesn't have any more right to unilaterally decide the name any more than you do.", "NAH - I won't judge you for not wanting a especific name, but I do think you are reading too much into it. It's a name, not a prophecy and you are not signing them up for Sunday school by giving a name. For context, I have a biblical name because my parents are very religious. I am not. I have decided to not follow any religion and have cut contact with my parents (for other stuff) and, while I know where my name came from, I never felt any sort of pressure to be religious because of it.", "NAH- but if you can't settle on a name, then things are going to be rather hard if you do get pregnant.

If you truly want your kid to find its own way then you'd need to expose them to many religions pretty equally.", ">I also am naturally a bit biased against Christianity as a religion (not Christians) due to religious trauma so I know at least 10% of me being against the name is because I don\u2019t want to have to associate our child with Christianity\n\nAlways baffling when a couple insists it's possible to simply \"agree to disagree\" on a topic like religion.  And in your case, it's Atheist vs. Christian, with your added historical trauma around religion.\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.  Neither of you will budge so good luck on a name---and the rest of the similar religious issues you're going to face in the future.", "I think this is a gentle ESH - Ideally , you need to agree on the name for your  child, and that normally means that either one of you can 'veto' a name if you don't like it or aren't comfortable with it. However, it sounds as though at the moment, you are both trying to make demands rather than looking for a compromise.\n\nThings to consider:\n\nIF he primarily likes the sound, rather than the meaning of the name, could you try to find names with a similar sound but a different meaning?\n\nYou are concerned about the name including a religious reference. Obviously this depends very much on the name and language but - does that really mean that it would be imposing any form of religion on the child? Lots of names have meanings, how far is the meaning seen as being part of the child's character? It's still valid for you to object if you feel uncomfortable with it because of what it says or implies about \\*your\\* beliefs, but it is worth considering.", "YTA-it's a name, and likely not a unique one.  I don't believe for a minute that every child named Gabriel is a devout Christian (Hebrew translation-God is my strength).  The child's name does not determine or foreshadow their religious beliefs.   Their upbringing and personal choices do.  If you and your husband have fundamental differences about your future child's exposure to various religions,  you have much larger issues.", "Each parent gets a veto on the name and call it done.  \n\nESH", "Pew Research Center says 80% of people take the same religious and political beliefs  of their parents.

He is attached to it because he liked how it sounded when he met someone with the name when he was a kid. It just happened to be a Christian name.\n\nquoting this from one of your comments. \n\nESH. We give the meanings to the names we give our children. Your husband has given the name a deep meaning that lies outside the context of religion. You are the one ascribing the religious context to the name and that seems to be the only reason you dislike this name. \n\nMy husband and I are both non religious, me aggressively so (insofar as keeping it out of my house). That being said, we learned that one of our kids names has a Very religious meaning. Do I hate his name now? Not at all. It only became something we learned about when his school assignment was to research his name.\n\nAs for why I say ESH, there should be compromise from both sides. Either the name should be taken completely out of consideration, or moving it to a middle name/second name to be considered. \n\nBut I will warn you, finding a name not given any religious meaning (in any religion) may prove difficult. All three of my children have at least one name given meaning in a religion. One of them has a roman name of a roman god, another has a name of God, the last has a name that is given much meaning within the Christin bible. Maybe just look at names you like without googling the etymology of the names themselves.", "Two separate issues here. For one, names should be two yesses, one no. If either partner says no, that\u2019s not the name you\u2019re choosing.\n\nOn the flipside, I think your concern about the meaning of the name is overblown. My parents were both atheists, I\u2019m an atheist, and my name is Hebrew for \u201cgrace of God\u201d. I cannot imagine a situation in which a kid would feel pressured to conform to a religion because of their name meaning. Most western names have some religious basis or origin\n\nI\u2019d say NTA, bordering on E S H, because your husband should know that it\u2019s not just his kid and he doesn\u2019t get sole naming rights. However, if your only objection is the religious concern and you do actually like the name, I think you should put your concerns aside", "He isn\u2019t a \u201cdevote \u201c Christian. He is borderline a agnostic.\nHe doesn\u2019t go to church and actively dodges his family when they try to get him to go.\n\nHe has no interest in raising the kids Christian.\n\nThe only reason he is stuck to the name is because he liked it when he was a kid. He reason he wants it is because he made a plan, not because it has \u201cGod\u201d in it.", "In our culture our names are kind of like a prophecy. Like what you are wishing for your child. We have songs which list our ancestors by name and their \u201cdeeds\u201d going back to 6th Century BC.\nSo there is some superstition around the names. A lot of people give their children names like \u201c I woke up with wealth\u201d to kind of hope that will happen for their child. I have some friends who are paranoid because their parents gave them names that essentially mean \u201cfruitful\u201d and they don\u2019t want kids so they joke like \u201c my parents jinxed me to have many kids\u201d however there is a serious concern underlying.", "Thank you!

The name he uses and goes by is Abdullah, but his birth name was Gabriel. His parents and siblings still call him by that and he is fine with it and he is a very religious Muslim, who is well known in his local Muslim community and is someone who does the call for prayer at the local mosque.\n\nSometimes a name is just a name and can always be changed", "He says that right now\u2026 wait until baby is on the way and his family and him will want a christian baby\u2026 he already started with the Christian name..", "I understand.

Even names.", "In complete agreement with No Arachnid, and just wanted to offer another supporting anecdote.\n\nI think one of my family member's names means something like \"God is Gracious.\" Their parents chose it because one of them came across it in a novel and thought it sounded pretty. Said family member is an atheist and was raised an atheist.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe you should take some time to work out why you had such a negative response to giving your kid a name with a religious meaning. If there's something underlying it, like if you had a hard time leaving Christianity, or if it's something to do with the tenants of the faith, or you don't like something about how your husband or family members practice their faiths, then that's something it would be good to start working through now rather than leave to cause problems after you have kids.", "She believes that the name will somehow pressure the kid into being religious.

The difference between us is religious though. He still has majority positive associations , I still have majority negative memories so of course he wouldn\u2019t have an issue with the word", "But there's a difference between being exposed to religion and having it as part of their name.", "There really isn't.
