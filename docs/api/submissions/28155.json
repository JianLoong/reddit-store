We give the meanings to the names we give our children. Your husband has given the name a deep meaning that lies outside the context of religion. You are the one ascribing the religious context to the name and that seems to be the only reason you dislike this name. \n\nMy husband and I are both non religious, me aggressively so (insofar as keeping it out of my house). That being said, we learned that one of our kids names has a Very religious meaning. Do I hate his name now? Not at all. It only became something we learned about when his school assignment was to research his name.\n\nAs for why I say ESH, there should be compromise from both sides. Either the name should be taken completely out of consideration, or moving it to a middle name/second name to be considered. \n\nBut I will warn you, finding a name not given any religious meaning (in any religion) may prove difficult. All three of my children have at least one name given meaning in a religion. One of them has a roman name of a roman god, another has a name of God, the last has a name that is given much meaning within the Christin bible.

My parents were both atheists, I\u2019m an atheist, and my name is Hebrew for \u201cgrace of God\u201d. I cannot imagine a situation in which a kid would feel pressured to conform to a religion because of their name meaning. Most western names have some religious basis or origin\n\nI\u2019d say NTA, bordering on E S H, because your husband should know that it\u2019s not just his kid and he doesn\u2019t get sole naming rights.

I feel it is pretty important to see what your reaction is even about.", "The way you describe the names sounds like you're Nigerian (or similar west African culture) if that's the case then you're definitely both thinking waaay too deeply about it. My name has God in it, I am a Christian, my name has never had any bearing on my religion simply because it is just my name, I don't think of it as \"the will of the Lord\" or whatever.

I (f) chose my son's name because I loved it, the meaning just happens to be \"a gift from God\". He was baptised Catholic and grew up to be Atheist and gay, both of which I'm 100% OK with but he's still MY gift from MY God even if he doesn't believe in one himself.

I just don't think it's that deep for him.", "i think you should both agree on what you name your child-that said if the name your husband likes is something like for instance- john which comes from hebrew meaning god is gracious aren't you just being a little ridiculous who thinks of the name john as being religious?", "You are entitled to your opinion so I'm going NAH even if as an exmormon myself I think refusing to name someone something like \"Joshua\" is absolutely ridiculous.

It doesn't mark them as anything in particular because those sorts of names have been used in modern times non-secularly more than they are used secularly.\n\nBut again, NAH because everyone can have their own preferences.", "Could you do something like (for example) John which has the meaning \u201cgod is gracious\u201d.

Most of us have religious names and it means nothing in life. Sounds like the real problem is your aversion to that religion, which is a petty reason to shut down your husbands idea.", "Nta because naming a baby is a two yes one no thing but I reallt find your reasoning here to be weird. Very few people care about or even know the meaning of their name and it\u2019s definitely not some life altering thing. My first and middle names mean wisdom and knowledge, but I\u2019m not some super intelligent and wise person. I\u2019m a dumbass who has a really hard time with math.

But mainly because of the insane fiasco that is pregnancy/childbirth\u2026 I think women should get slightly more say in the first and middle names.\n\nObviously, no one should be forced to name their baby something they really hate or have concerns about (bullying, cultural, bad experiences, etc.)\u2026 but fathers should be okay accepting names that are \u201cmeh\u201d to them if the mother of their child loves it.

We have a son and haven't encountered any problems raising him, just respecting his right to explore, learn, and self-determine. As such, I really don't think picking on the religious aspect of the argument is helpful here.\n\nOP, NTA. My wife and I gave our son a religious middle name and chose a family name for his first name. Your offer of a compromise sounds like it's being made in good faith, and really both parents should be able to say no to any name for any reason.", "That\u2019s what I thought too. I googled it though when OP said it means god supports me and the first name suggested was Josiah which does sound very biblical", "Thank you :)\nTo start I will confirm as OP that nothing you said caused any offence and definitely did not make me feel like you were diminishing my feelings.\nThankyou for checking though :).\n\nThe name translates loosely to \u201cGod supports me/ walks with me\u201d\n\nI think I didn\u2019t give enough context.\n\nThe names in our culture are a mix of literal conditions of the birth and kind of like a wish/hope for your child.

So if you have a name that has something to do with God looking after you, if you get good grades, a good job etc\u2026 it is common for family members to say something like \u201c yeah God has your back\u201d.

Sometimes we need to adjust childhood dreams to fit the reality of our adult situations. When he was a child he dreamed of naming a child with the blessing of god.
