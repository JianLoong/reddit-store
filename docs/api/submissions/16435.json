I am the stepmother of his two boys from his first marriage Lee (14m) and Kai (8m). Their mother passed away 7 years ago. Kai calls me mom and has since he was 4. Lee calls me by my first name. Kai has wanted me to adopt him for some time now and it was something discussed. The reason it has not happened is Lee does not want me to adopt him and my husband did not feel comfortable with me adopting only Kai. He's worried about it coming between the boys, about Lee maybe feeling left out eventually, but I think the main reason is he worries about the judgement of others and the fact the comments could get to both of the boys. I love both Lee and Kai. But my relationship with each of them is different. Kai is my son and we have a mother-son relationship. Lee is my stepson, who I love, but he doesn't always like that I'm here. Sometimes he gets annoyed that I'm here instead of his mom. Sometimes he treats me okay. But he has never been okay with me filling too much of his mom's role in his life. Our relationship is a delicate balancing act.\n\nThe boys have been in therapy. We also did therapy together as a family. My husband asked the therapist for their opinion on the adoption and she said we made the right decision and that when the boys get older (she said once the boys are around 10 and 16 respectively, and their feelings have not changed, then adopting just Kai could be okay. But to make sure Lee is spoken to again and given the option to express if he changed his mind).\n\nThis has been challenging because so many people have opinions. I hate seeing Kai sad. But I don't want to force anything on Lee either or risk him feeling a certain way if we make the wrong decision.\n\nMy ILs mentioned I should adopt the boys about a month into the marriage. At the time my husband told them we didn't need to rush anything. But now they are aware of what is going on and they told me it's shameful that I have not adopted the boys and become their legal mother. They said Lee is depriving both himself and his brother of the legal protection of my being their mother and that I am showing clear favoritism by \"making it obvious\" I want to adopt Kai and not Lee. I asked them how I make that obvious and they ignored my question. They told me I should have jumped at the chance to be their mother. That it was monstrous to consider making one of them mine and discarding the other like yesterdays garbage. That angered me because I have always done my best. I ended up saying that they had no right to judge me for not adopting the boys because they have no idea what it's like to be a stepparent, and especially to stepchildren who have lost their biological parent to death, and they have no idea what it's like when both kids want different relationships with you.

You are doing things right, and taking the boys feelings and differing circumstances in to account. Good on you! Ignore the inlaws, and keep on keeping on.", "NTA - tell the in-laws to mind their business. Discuss with both boys what the plan for them would be if something happened to their dad. Explain if you adopted them they could stay with you as their mother, but if they were not adopted by you they would have to go elsewhere. This reality may help change Lee\u2019s mind.", "NTA! You do you. Adopting is not something that's open for a debate outside four people in your family: you, your husband, Kai and Lee.", "It's the inlaws business because _______? NTA", "NTA - I think your in-laws over stepped but is it possible you are favoring Kai to Lee? Do you know what they meant by you \u201cmaking it obvious\u201d?", "NTA but do speak with an attorney about living wills and advance directives. If anything were to happen to your stepkids at least there is documentation in place for you to make medical decisions on their behalf. If not your IL\u2019s can make a bad situation worse.", "NTA. It sounds like your ILs are making so many assumptions! You\u2019ve been thoughtful about how you are navigating this very difficult situation.", "NTA.\n\nYou are absolutely doing the right thing and your ILs are pressuring you for their own emotional reasons and/or to stir trouble in your families relationships.\n\nIf you've talked to both of the children and they are happy, and your husband and you are happy and you have a legal framework in place so that if anything happens to your husband the children would remain with you, then there is no reason to change it.\n\nYou aren't playing favourites, but Lee remembers his mother and his grief around his mothers death is inevitably tied to his interactions with you. Family therapy will help him, but he's a kid and he can't necessarily separate out all the emotions he's feeling. Kai doesn't remember her, and you've always been his mother, which makes it much easier for him.\n\nILs love judging more than helping I would guess, and just point out that you're acting in the interests of the emotional wellbeing of the family, who all have views the ILs aren't taking into account, including the children.\n\nForcing adoptions on teenagers is not a good move, and doing so could potentially destroy the family relationships. Waiting until Kai and Lee are older, and more reconciled and mature in their emotional intelligence and their relationship with you, is absolutely the right thing to do. Lee may never want to be adopted, and he's four years from being 18.\n\nDiscussing this in family therapy is a good idea, and allowing the children space to express their emotions without forcing the emotions of the wider family on them is the right thing to do. It's slow though and people love to rush to what they think is problem solved (replace deceased partner with a currently living partner literally and legally).\n\nAlso let your husband deal with the in-laws pressure, because it isn't fair on you to be solely responsible for a group decision and hounded about it.", "You in laws should NOT be involved.  it is NOT their nuclear family.\n\nThis is between you , your spouse and the boys.

They are not with you every day. They do not see the complexity in your life. They should mind there own f\\*\\*\\*ing business.\n\nIt seems very much, that you ILs have a very strong opinion, while not considering the feelings of every single person in your family... I mean it is clear, that both relationships are very different. Lee was 7 when his mother died, of course he does want a replacement... \n\nKai however, does not remember his mother, as hard as this sounds. You are his mother.\n\nRegardless of your ILs, your should however consider adopting Kai. If Lee feels left out, you can always adopt him at a later time - if he wishes. The point is this, every action - even no action - is a decision.\n\nWaiting is bad for Kai, because he wants to be adopted now.  \nAdopting only Kai, might be bad for Lee, because he feels left out  \nAdopting both might also be bad for Kai, because he feels is late mother gets replaced.\n\nRegardless what you do, there are consequences, you have to decide, which of the three options, has the smallest ones.

Especially seeing as my husband strongly agrees with it for right now.", "Lee would rather be with his maternal aunt if anything were to happen to my husband. That is something has has always been pretty clear on and it makes sense because she and their mom were close and she has been a big part of their lives and Lee gets extra comfort from her than he would from me in that scenario.

But in terms of where everyone is at they believe this is the best option for now.", "They do and I truly believe that. But unless they tell someone something like that, we cannot do anything about it. Kai has never expressed to anyone else, not even his therapist, that he doesn't like how I treat him or that I favor his brother. If anything he expresses when he feels like I have overstepped in some way and did something that should be left for his dad to do, or if I do something to mom-ish for him.", "Honestly I\u2019d just flat out ask them if Kai has said anything to them. It sounds like youre doing whats best for these boys though and it is not always the easiest.", "I might just ask my husband to, since they clearly do not want to communicate their reasoning with me.

Your in laws are right to the extent that it is certain you are making \"mistakes\" with Lee, but wrong that the solution is some magic bullet of law. You have picked the path of risk aversion, that the consequences of being wrong are the least.\n\nIn any event you sought the advice of someone (the family therapist) whose job it is to speak for a deeper interest.", "NTA Buuut I do feel bad for Kai here. By being respectful of Lee, you're being disrespectful towards Kais feelings. He wants to be adopted, you're his mom, not doing so might feel like a rejection. He could even resent his brother for preventing it.\n\nI don't see how adopting Kai would make Lee feel left out if he doesn't want to be adopted? And I'm sure you'd always want to adopt him later on if he changes his mind?", "NTA, why is Lee's feelings irrelevant to his grandparents? You're literally being a good parent by respecting him in this. And yes, it sucks for Kai, but with continued reassurance that adoption is more a piece of paper and adult legal stuff and won't change how you feel about him this will be the better option out of a very difficult situation.", "NTA and I very much disagree with them saying it\u2019s terrible that you would \u201cmake one yours and discard the other like garbage\u201d when that isn\u2019t what the situation would be at all. If you do end up adopting one and not the other, that wouldn\u2019t be favoritism imo it would be respecting each child\u2019s respective wishes. If Lee maintains that he does not want to be adopted you not doing so would not be \u201cdiscarding\u201d him, it would be respecting him and his boundaries. It sounds like you\u2019re doing the best you can in a sticky situation. Grandparents might be too emotional and too close to the situation to be able to see logic. Best of luck to all of you.", "NTA and you are doing a great Job!!!", "NTA. You handled this beautifully.  Well done.", "NTA. Lee already has a mom and will grieve not having her forever. You are respecting him by not adopting him. \n\nYou are the only mom Kai knows, and all he wants is for it to be official. You are in a tough spot. \n\nIs there any way to have guardianship papers drawn up for Lee? That way it differentiates the relationships but shows you are responsible for both? You obviously care about the boys a great deal. You wouldn\u2019t be so worried about Lee\u2019s feelings if you didn\u2019t. \n\nYour in laws seem to care more about appearances than the boys. A 14 year old is old enough to say, I remember my mom, I didn\u2019t want to be adopted if other people bring it up to him.", "NTA OP.", "Nta although I think your husband is wrong to say no to adopting the child who *wants* to be adopted, you have 100% right to not force it on the child who does NOT want to be adopted.\n\nYour husband needs to firmly tell his parents that this topic is not up for discussion and if they continue to bring it up, they will no longer be allowed access to their grandchildren.", "I would also see about some kind of legal guardianship for now, meaning that she can do medical appointments, etc. as well as some kind of security about shared custody in even of a  split, especially the youngest.\n\nNeed to discuss the legal guardianship with Oldest so they understand that its not adoption but provides another adult to be legally responsible, so can sign school paperwork, doctor stuff, vacation stuff etc. And provides a safety net should anything happen to the dad.", "Yeah that kid definitely doesn't want to be adopted. Your in-laws can hold whatever opinion they want but it doesn't match the reality of the situation or what the therapist recommended. If you try to force something it will go extremely poorly. You're doing a fantastic job imo. NTA.", "Make sure the aunt is willing and have this custody arrangement made legal. Your husband needs to realize that his boys don\u2019t see eye to eye. I bet Lee would appreciate your flexibility with his preferences. I don\u2019t see why they have to be treated the same. Adopt Kai now, adopt Lee later if he changes his mind.", "Have you considered seeing a lawyer and getting this set in stone? I'm sure there could be some kind of will written where they both can choose at that time, if the worst comes to pass. Then if something does happen, they're both already taken care of and you don't need to worry.", "I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s to do with Lee, and it coming between the boys. Although, the exact opposite could occur if Kai finds out that Lee is \u201cblocking\u201d the adoption.\n\nIMO, this is waaaay above reddits pay grade and following the professionals advice is not a bad plan. We simply don\u2019t know enough about the situation to give sound advice.", "So their reasoning for why it I'd a bad idea is because....it's harmful?", "I think you should reassure Kai that you're his mother no matter what a piece of paper says. He's too young to be thinking of legal stuff and the only way an adoption really matters is in a legal sense.", "NTA - you guys are doing a great job! This is some of the most sensitive, considerate, kind hearted, and sensible parenting I've heard about, particularly with stepkids and on Reddit! You ILs need to butt out, might be a good idea to go LC with them until your family makes definite decisions about adoption.", "YTA.  Lee is old enough to have a serious conversation on this topic. Surely he does not want his brother to be sad. There's no reason you can't adopt Kai and not Lee. You would be honoring both of their wishes. They are different ages and have had vastly different life experiences.", "NTA. It\u2019s a delicate situation.", "NTA, your ILs I presume are elderly folks. Let them say what they will, smile and nod.", "NTA - and you're doing a fantastic job as a step parent. You aren't forcing a relationship, you're listening to their needs, and you and your husband are communicating within your own relationship separate from the kids. \n\nYour in-laws need to respect that. Hell, they should congratulate you on being a fab step-mom.", "NTA. The ILs are the only AHs here. Forcing an adoption on a child is a recipe for disaster. And could cause problems between the siblings as well. Not just you.  Im curious if they liked the kids late mother? And maybe want her \nforgotten?\n\n  I do think your husband needs to have a talk with his parents though.", "NTA. Several step kids have had posts here about the trauma of being adopted against their will, or being forced to call stepparents Mom/Dad. You are showing care for Lee by respecting his wishes. It\u2019s ok for kids to have different relationships with you, as long as both kids are getting what they need and respect each other\u2019s choices. \n\nI do hope that Lee is supported in remembering his mother, and that Kai is told stories about her.", "Don't worry, op, you're winning the step parent tight rope. You're doing what's right for the boys. Plus, you and hubs are communicating with the boys and therapy. \n\nIn-laws are probably looking at optics and making assumptions about how you relate to each child. They do not see that you're being sensitive to both and how they want to interact. Sometimes the older generation way is to bulldoze things over, and that never worked! \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nIt's a good thing your ILs have never been stepparents as they would have made a mess of it. You're doing it just right.", "NTA - grand parents are way over the line.", "Wow NTA your inlawd sound awful. Even if they were step parents themselves that doesn't give them any right to push their opinions on you. Based on everything you said I agree with the therapist's suggestion. Wait and if they still want that then go for it. Adopting wither or both of the boys against their wishes would be so much worse than waiting until everyone was certain.", "NTA and your IL's absolutely are. You don't need to talk to them, since they are being so dense and insulting. They don't seem to care that their grandson does not **want** to be adopted. You and your husband are showing his children respect. Their grandparents are showing their impatience. They can just stay mad.", "NTA\n\nJust wondering if you're in the USA? Adoption isn't as common in other countries is all.", "NTA", "NTA - and frankly I have so much respect for you, for having that stance. I am a step parent, I am also a stepchild. Being a stepchild for me was a horrible experience my dad pretty much forgot my sister and I existed once he got married to someone else and had kids. We have never been a priority in his life. I think you guys are doing a phenomenal job, and I get that having a different relationship with both children, it happens.", "NTA. You're doing the right thing. Forcing the adoption on Lee will only cause issues. Give it a couple more years and see where the boys are at. Your pushy in laws need to mind their own business.", "NTA, maybe ask your Husband for more help in dealing with his parents, to back off. It\u2019s a sensitive subject already, but what you are doing sounds like you are trying to navigate it properly.", "NTA\n\nOur relationships with our parents are very complex, and by extension, so are the relationships between stepchild and stepparent. People who\u2019ve never been part of a step family don\u2019t understand just how complicated in can be. Even when the adult and child get along very well, that child may not want that adult to be their parent. And that\u2019s ok. It would break whatever trust exists between you and Lee if you forced yourself into a role he doesn\u2019t want you have.", "Nta", "NTA - but your hubby should have a will naming you as the boy\u2019s guardian if he died. This would protect the boys from being uprooted if their dad died too but without the emotional issues that you have in the current situation.", "NTA you are giving both kids what they need, there is a huge age gap, needs are not the same.", "NAH but absolutely GET YOUR WILLS/GUARDIANSHIP IN ORDER.  There\u2019s another post on here from a few days ago with an older sister trying to rip custody of a 9yr old away from step-mom who\u2019s been the boy\u2019s mother since he was under a year old.  Older sister always prevented step-mom from formally adopting the boy.  DON\u2019T let that step-mom be you.", "NTA.  Repeat after me, OP:  \"I'm not going to discuss this with you, MIL/FIL.  It's none of your business.\"  Say that whenever they bring it up.", "NTA\n\nHuh. Funny coincidence. Lost my dad at 2. Mom married my stepfather when I was 3. She had him adopt me at age 9 \"in case anything ever happened to her\". He DID NOT adopt my 14yr old sister. \"She is old enough that if anything happened she would be okay\". He was abusive so I suspect there was some 'she didnt want him to' things in there. But who the heck tells young kids those things? Lol\n\nUltimately nothing changed. We stayed sisters. Family stayed the same. When my mom (prophetically) died when I was 13 I had a legal parent. My sister had moved out at 18. No one cared that he adopted one of us and not both.", "OP all I can say is that your respect for the wishes of both of these boys is truly wonderful. You respected that the oldest was not wanting that and needing time, and still appears to feel that way. I think it\u2019s coming time though to sit down with him and ask him if it\u2019s ok to start the process with younger DH and tell him again he also has a choice. If anyone questions this or thinks you are wrong to adopt one then let them know that you respect them both and love them both equally abs because of that you are honoring his with to remain the step parent so he is always the legal child of his deceased mom. That will shut them up. Your in laws are 100 percent wrong, and need a reality check. You are an amazing parent/step-parent.

Kai and Lee have different needs and expectation which you current cannot meet because the needs are so wildly different.  Trust yourself as you are doing the right thing.   Your husband may need to politely to tell his parents to zip it.", "It\u2019s not really even a question, the situation is complex and the emotion of the situation isn\u2019t something to factor. Legal guardianship should be made clear in another capacity, unless there is something you\u2019re not telling us, and that is what\u2019s going on with the biological mother? Is she a threat? Did she recently die? Does the 14 year old have behavioral issues and your terrified of the liabilities that brings, are the grandparents concerned with being left the troubled child  at this point, Why is the opinion of a partially developed brain swimming in hormones relevant to his legal security over the next 4 years, why are we prioritizing the 14 year olds emotional state? I cannot say for certain your motivations are entirely unselfish because the truth of these boards is that people who make selfish decisions come to these boards to be validated even if they are not telling the entire story. I can\u2019t say, because it seems like you\u2019ve painted a biased picture. \nIs this your first marriage? \n How long have you been together?", "NTA what a wonderful respectful stepmum you are.\nYou should be applauded for how you are handling this.\nThroughout this entire thread you talk about the boys feelings, not a mention of your own. You are truly putting them first.", "NTA.  This is an issue for your husband to handle.  He needs to tell his parents in no uncertain terms to mind their own business. Alienating you helps no one.  And the fact that they're trying to force the issue of adoption is proof that they're in the wrong. Because they're not considering Lee's feelings at all.  The fact that you haven't forced an adoption on Lee is proof that you're a better parent than them every day of the week.  And your husband should tell them that.", "NTA\nMy stepdad was the only father figure I\u2019ve ever had but he was so respectful of my moms choice to wait until I could make the decision. I got adopted at 16 due to complications. You\u2019re doing the right things", "NTA To me it doesn't sound like you are making any favoritism obvious. Lee is making it clear that he doesn't see you as his mom because he doesn't call you mom. The decision is not yours to make, but the boys, and they feel differently. You're all handling it well, but your in laws are being unreasonable and honestly kinda nosy.", "NTA. You are doing the right thing. When Lee is a little older you can sit him down and say Kai wants me to adopt him, but I haven\u2019t since you\u2019ve expressed you don\u2019t want to be adopted and I don\u2019t want this divide between you as brothers. Now that you are older I want to see if your feelings have changed, and if they haven\u2019t, if it would be okay with you to remain un-adopted if I adopt Kai. I love you both so much but I want to respect your boundaries and I know I could never replace your mother, but if you decide you want me as your stand in mom I\u2019d be honored to take that role in your life. Exactly as you said. \n\nYou\u2019re doing a great job. You sound like a wonderful person.", "NTA", "You are demonstrating incredible respect for both boys by giving them the love they are prepared to receive from you (at this time in their lives). It\u2019s not more or less than the other but definitely different\u2026 kind of like the difference between equitable and equal. \n\nNTA", "As a step child, I can remember not being comfortable with my step dad when I was young. He is been in my life since I was very small, so it is fairly different from your situation. I will say that as I've grown, I have seen how much work he put into raising me right and in being there for me, though I was not his. As a teenager, that is not something I understood. I was rebellious, and I would fight him on many things.\nAs an adult, I am now very grateful that he was there. I know that I would not be the person I am if he had not been. He did not adopt me, but I love him all the same. It is not the adoption that matters, but the relationship. As long as you put that first, the rest will fall into place.", "NTA but you do know what it\u2019s like to be a stepparent\u2026.because you are one and have been for awhile.", "What you need are fewer opinions.\n\nThere are 4 people who's opinion matters.  I suspect you can figure out who.  It doesn't have to be complicated.  You can adopt one and not the other.  OR.. you can adopt neither of them.   OR you can adopt them both.  OR you can adopt one now and the other later.  OR you can do nothing and wait.   All of these are perfectly valid options and outside of the 4 of you, nobody else's opinion matters.  AT ALL.", "NTA for all the reasons already said.", "As a Step Child you are doing great.", "NTA\n\nyou adopting kids has nothing to do with how you step parent.\n\nThey don\u2019t know and it\u2019s really gross everyone is ignoring Lee\u2019s legitimate feelings \n\nYou waiting and seeing is best and it\u2019s clear Lee has made up his mind for now. The only thing keeping Kai from adoption is his father and your hang ups. NOT LEE.", "NTA. I wouldn't take any advice from people who don't give a fuck what their grandson wants. This is especially fucked up since it's about replacing his *mother.* Lee does not want to be adopted but the grandparents are still criticizing you for not forcing adoption on him when he was younger. They are wrong, and this is absolutely a hill to die on. Lee's wishes on this should be respected.", "Not only that, but the one thing the ILs are correct about are the legal protections. There comes a point where one needs to prioritize what's best for everyone vs what's best for one, Lee's feelings be damned. He needs to understand that his brother also has the right to be happy and so long as the option always remains open for him, adopting Kai shouldn't be an issue.", "I thimk the in laws are the kind of  people who think everything falls magically into place if the papers are signed and all is tidy. There are grandparents around from a previous marriage? Cut them off. Children do not want to get adopted? Ignore their wishes. Devorced dad wants to stay in the picture? Only till the new husband is around. It is exhausting to listen to them as they always pick their idea of the perfect family over the people that are involved. NTA, OP, and do not let anyone disturb you. If they continue to have an opinion, maybe just say \"It is more complicated than that, you know?\" and go away. If they want details to better understand the situation, they can ask instead of asuming.", "The only thing I would consider changing/pursuing if I were you (and you may have already done it) is discuss with the therapist the possibility of a conversation with Lee about what Kai wants. I get the concern that it could come between the boys but I would have been mature enough at 14 to respect that my sibling wanted/felt safest with a different option, and if Kai would feel more secure being formally adopted it would be nice to get that done, if it can be done without hurting Lee. Obv you should defer to your therapist vs me, an internet stranger, but a mediated conversation (with a plan for keeping the kids in touch) might help.\n\nThat said, I have been a contingency planner for as long as I can remember. I felt safer thinking about worst case scenarios and making plans for them than sweeping them under the rug, and I hadn't lost a parent. I get it if Lee  would be hurt rather than helped by this discussion.", "[stolen comment](https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138iifs/_/jiyrbu8/?context=1)", "Then wouldn't it be better to not adopt Lee at all then, since he doesn't want it? And just become his legal guardian? He would get all the benefits of his biological family, and if his stepmom wanted, he could become heirs of her family as well. He could even call her mom, if he ever warmed up to her, and introduce her to his friends as his mother. Nobody would even know she wasn't technically his mom. And if he never warms up to her, then he can just continue to refer to her as his stepmom.", "But what would the difference be between a parent and a legal guardian? Aren't they the same for all practical purposes?", "NTA you hubby needs to smack his parents with a dose of reality. He seems like he needs to communicate better with his parents or\u2026 just block those awful people for three or four months.", "Your ILs should shut their mouths. It sounds like you're approaching this with kindness and sense. NTA.\n\nHowever, what's your husband doing while your ILs are going off like this? He ought to be handling this s\\*\\*t.", "NTA, you have talked to the boys, you are taking their feelings into consideration. You have talked to a therapist. You don't have to listen to that and your husband should shut them down. They don't know what the dynamic is or why you haven't done the adoption yet and it's none of their business.", "NTA. You're respecting both your husband and older stepson's wishes", "NTA but for legal safety reasons, do you have a legal guardianship? Even if you might pursue adoption later, you should make sure you have an actual legal guardianship in place for worst case scenarios. You can explain to Lee that it's not adoption-- it just gives you the power to make medical decisions and stuff if his dad is unavailable.", "Your husband needs to step in with HIS parents and make them understand it is not ok to harrass you about family matters that the family has decided upon after therapy.\n\nThey are way overstepping.\n\nIt actually sounds like you are navigating the tricky shoals of step-parenthood in a sensible way.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m so glad to hear a story on this sub about a stepmom that isn\u2019t evil and resents their stepchildren. You w don\u2019t let a great job at trying to forge a relationship with both the boys and even allowing them their freedom to grieve and develop their level of comfort on their own time. I commend you, don\u2019t allow anyone the right to talk down to you or criticize when they aren\u2019t walking in your shoes. \n\n\nNTA", "Nta your in-laws are really terrible", "NTA.  Honestly, stop engaging on this with these people.  It takes someone with a crap abusive family sometimes to tell you this. I had one, so I will:  you, your husband & the 2 kids.  That's it, that's whose opinion on this matters.  Once again, that's it.", "NTA.", "Yes. She\u2019s well on her way to having them both considering her as family, even if only Kai considers her as his mother. This would be a great outcome regardless of what the pushy in-laws think.", "Oh I agree!! It\u2019s better for her to gain guardianship than adopt for Lee. I wasn\u2019t trying to disagree. Only explain how the two paths are different.", "No they\u2019re not the same\n\n\u201cParent\u201d is a title. Not a legal status. Anyone can call someone by a mom, dad or parent.\n\nParents are usually legal guardian a BUT NOT ALWAYS. Any children in foster care have parents who are not their legal guardians and are wards of the state. The state decides for them and their parents don\u2019t get a say in anything even health matters once stripped of guardianship. The state can\u2019t strip or grant the the title parent though.  \n\nIn most states you can only have 2 legal guardians. Some have 4 now due to step parents and what nowt.\n\nLegal guardians are responsible for the child they have guardianship over. You want to see the kid in the hospital? Show the paper work. Your kid fucks someone\u2019s property. You\u2019re paying damages. \n\nJust because Kai calls OP mom doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019d be held responsible if he damages property or that that she could see him in the hospital without his father there. It\u2019s only by his father\u2019s consent that OP can take the kid anywhere or pick him up from school. The father has the right to that consent because he\u2019s the legal guardian. Depending on the school, she may not be allowed to add people to Kai\u2019s pickup list because she\u2019s not his legal guardian. Legal guardians were the only ones where I worked that could change pickup lists for example. Just because Kai says she\u2019s my mom doesn\u2019t mean the school will listen to her"]}
