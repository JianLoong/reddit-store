I am the stepmother of his two boys from his first marriage Lee (14m) and Kai (8m). Their mother passed away 7 years ago. Kai calls me mom and has since he was 4. Lee calls me by my first name. Kai has wanted me to adopt him for some time now and it was something discussed. The reason it has not happened is Lee does not want me to adopt him and my husband did not feel comfortable with me adopting only Kai. He's worried about it coming between the boys, about Lee maybe feeling left out eventually, but I think the main reason is he worries about the judgement of others and the fact the comments could get to both of the boys. I love both Lee and Kai. But my relationship with each of them is different. Kai is my son and we have a mother-son relationship. Lee is my stepson, who I love, but he doesn't always like that I'm here. Sometimes he gets annoyed that I'm here instead of his mom. Sometimes he treats me okay. But he has never been okay with me filling too much of his mom's role in his life. Our relationship is a delicate balancing act.\n\nThe boys have been in therapy. We also did therapy together as a family. My husband asked the therapist for their opinion on the adoption and she said we made the right decision and that when the boys get older (she said once the boys are around 10 and 16 respectively, and their feelings have not changed, then adopting just Kai could be okay. But to make sure Lee is spoken to again and given the option to express if he changed his mind).\n\nThis has been challenging because so many people have opinions. I hate seeing Kai sad.

At the time my husband told them we didn't need to rush anything. But now they are aware of what is going on and they told me it's shameful that I have not adopted the boys and become their legal mother. They said Lee is depriving both himself and his brother of the legal protection of my being their mother and that I am showing clear favoritism by \"making it obvious\" I want to adopt Kai and not Lee. I asked them how I make that obvious and they ignored my question. They told me I should have jumped at the chance to be their mother. That it was monstrous to consider making one of them mine and discarding the other like yesterdays garbage. That angered me because I have always done my best. I ended up saying that they had no right to judge me for not adopting the boys because they have no idea what it's like to be a stepparent, and especially to stepchildren who have lost their biological parent to death, and they have no idea what it's like when both kids want different relationships with you.

Make it very clear to Lee you would love to adopt him, too. He'll say no. Tell him you are putting a reminder on your calendar to ask him every x months (3, 6?), then do it. Tell him he doesn't have to wait until the next reminder if he decides on adoption. Otherwise, don't bug him about it and don't act hurt when he says no. 'OK, just checking in. I love you.\"", "NTA, obviously. You didn't say anything that wasn't true. The only way you could be TA is if you were in some way neglecting your relatio ship with the older boy, but not only is that not the case, you're actively going to therapy with them and doing all you can to take their different needs into account.

You are doing things right, and taking the boys feelings and differing circumstances in to account. Good on you! Ignore the inlaws, and keep on keeping on.", "NTA - tell the in-laws to mind their business. Discuss with both boys what the plan for them would be if something happened to their dad. Explain if you adopted them they could stay with you as their mother, but if they were not adopted by you they would have to go elsewhere. This reality may help change Lee\u2019s mind.", "NTA! You do you. Adopting is not something that's open for a debate outside four people in your family: you, your husband, Kai and Lee.", "It's the inlaws business because _______? NTA", "NTA - I think your in-laws over stepped but is it possible you are favoring Kai to Lee? Do you know what they meant by you \u201cmaking it obvious\u201d?", "NTA but do speak with an attorney about living wills and advance directives. If anything were to happen to your stepkids at least there is documentation in place for you to make medical decisions on their behalf. If not your IL\u2019s can make a bad situation worse.", "NTA. It sounds like your ILs are making so many assumptions! You\u2019ve been thoughtful about how you are navigating this very difficult situation.", "NTA.\n\nYou are absolutely doing the right thing and your ILs are pressuring you for their own emotional reasons and/or to stir trouble in your families relationships.\n\nIf you've talked to both of the children and they are happy, and your husband and you are happy and you have a legal framework in place so that if anything happens to your husband the children would remain with you, then there is no reason to change it.\n\nYou aren't playing favourites, but Lee remembers his mother and his grief around his mothers death is inevitably tied to his interactions with you. Family therapy will help him, but he's a kid and he can't necessarily separate out all the emotions he's feeling. Kai doesn't remember her, and you've always been his mother, which makes it much easier for him.\n\nILs love judging more than helping I would guess, and just point out that you're acting in the interests of the emotional wellbeing of the family, who all have views the ILs aren't taking into account, including the children.\n\nForcing adoptions on teenagers is not a good move, and doing so could potentially destroy the family relationships. Waiting until Kai and Lee are older, and more reconciled and mature in their emotional intelligence and their relationship with you, is absolutely the right thing to do. Lee may never want to be adopted, and he's four years from being 18.\n\nDiscussing this in family therapy is a good idea, and allowing the children space to express their emotions without forcing the emotions of the wider family on them is the right thing to do. It's slow though and people love to rush to what they think is problem solved (replace deceased partner with a currently living partner literally and legally).\n\nAlso let your husband deal with the in-laws pressure, because it isn't fair on you to be solely responsible for a group decision and hounded about it.", "You in laws should NOT be involved.  it is NOT their nuclear family.\n\nThis is between you , your spouse and the boys.  It sounds like you have been doing all the right thinks, and taking it slow.  Its nice to hear you are treating Lee with respect, and hearing what he has to say.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your ILs haven\u2019t a clue. You\u2019re following the therapists lead, you\u2019re doing your best and raising both boys. Lee May never want to be adopted, and that\u2019s okay. No reason on earth to force the issue. You\u2019re doing a great job, ignore them as much as possible. Have your husband intervene if need be.", "NTA this is none of their business. This is between you, your husband and your stepchildren.", "NTA, first of all\n\nHow does your husband react, if his family is talking to you like this?\n\nI would definitely put them down, if they spoke like that to my wife... They are not with you every day. They do not see the complexity in your life. They should mind there own f\\*\\*\\*ing business.\n\nIt seems very much, that you ILs have a very strong opinion, while not considering the feelings of every single person in your family... I mean it is clear, that both relationships are very different. Lee was 7 when his mother died, of course he does want a replacement... \n\nKai however, does not remember his mother, as hard as this sounds. You are his mother.\n\nRegardless of your ILs, your should however consider adopting Kai. If Lee feels left out, you can always adopt him at a later time - if he wishes. The point is this, every action - even no action - is a decision.\n\nWaiting is bad for Kai, because he wants to be adopted now.  \nAdopting only Kai, might be bad for Lee, because he feels left out  \nAdopting both might also be bad for Kai, because he feels is late mother gets replaced.\n\nRegardless what you do, there are consequences, you have to decide, which of the three options, has the smallest ones. I would take option 2, because you can always adopt Kai later, if he chooses.", "NTA", "LISTEN  to the professional and ignore your IL there full of shit. Your trying to do the right thing for everyone . SO NTA", "NTA\n\nI absolutely love the fact, you are being fair to both boys.  Fair meaning, giving them what they need to be successful in a relationship with you rather than giving them both the exact same thing.  Love is love.  Hopefully in time both boys will appreciate what you are doing to make sure they both feel safe, loved, and secure in their own home.", "NAH it is clear you are both loving both children while respecting the boundaries of a 14 y/o in a rough situation. It's also clear that you're doing your best to make things right.", "NTA - I think you are doing your best and your in-laws should shut the hell up.          \nYou and your husband seem to be putting what you think is best for the kids ahead of what other may think.       \nBut I do worry that Kai might get upset with Lee if he blames him for not being adopted ?", "That is something we will follow the therapists advice on. Especially seeing as my husband strongly agrees with it for right now.", "Lee would rather be with his maternal aunt if anything were to happen to my husband. That is something has has always been pretty clear on and it makes sense because she and their mom were close and she has been a big part of their lives and Lee gets extra comfort from her than he would from me in that scenario. Whereas Kai would want to be with me.", "They refused to say. I guess it could be because my relationship with Kai is different to my relationship with Lee. But that is based on Lee's boundaries and what Kai wants from me. But they refused to specify what they meant by that.", "Lee would actually go to their maternal aunt if anything were to happen to my husband. That is what he wants to happen. The legal framework is there. Kai would remain with me and the legal framework is there for that also.", "The act may have been wrong but maybe they had the right intention? The in-laws were out of line here but I\u2019m curious by what they meant still. \n\nRemember, they do have a relationship with these boys too so its possible they know something OP doesnt. This  isnt such a cut and dry situation.", "Reddit is full of stories about stepparents adopting kids when the kids weren\u2019t ready for it, or outright didn\u2019t want to be adopted. Forcing a relationship in these situations NEVER works. \nThese kids will appreciate you actually considering what is best for them and asking them what they want. \n\nNTA", "The therapist says don't adopt only Kai? What is their reasoning?", "Fair enough - this space isn\u2019t the friendliest to in-laws but you did highlight that they do love their grandsons. It may be possible that Kai, being 14 may not be the best at expressing his feelings to you and has said something to your in-laws.", "They said for right now, at least until they are both a little older (2 years from now in terms of timeline they mentioned). The reasoning is adopting Kai and not Lee right now could be more harmful than the other options. Neither is a perfect option because the boys want different things. But in terms of where everyone is at they believe this is the best option for now.", "They do and I truly believe that. But unless they tell someone something like that, we cannot do anything about it. Kai has never expressed to anyone else, not even his therapist, that he doesn't like how I treat him or that I favor his brother. If anything he expresses when he feels like I have overstepped in some way and did something that should be left for his dad to do, or if I do something to mom-ish for him.", "Honestly I\u2019d just flat out ask them if Kai has said anything to them. It sounds like youre doing whats best for these boys though and it is not always the easiest.", "I might just ask my husband to, since they clearly do not want to communicate their reasoning with me. Maybe they will tell him something they won't tell me. Though they have brought nothing up to him about this.", "If you honestly feel your in-laws have the kids best interests at heart, it might be worth it.", "It might be but if nothing is said, then it will leave a bad taste in my mouth to have been judged so harshly by them, for reasons they refuse to speak about. This whole thing is already not easy and my ILs saying what they did just added to the stress and worry I feel about our family.", "NTA. You are right. Your in laws are right to the extent that it is certain you are making \"mistakes\" with Lee, but wrong that the solution is some magic bullet of law. You have picked the path of risk aversion, that the consequences of being wrong are the least.\n\nIn any event you sought the advice of someone (the family therapist) whose job it is to speak for a deeper interest.", "NTA Buuut I do feel bad for Kai here. By being respectful of Lee, you're being disrespectful towards Kais feelings. He wants to be adopted, you're his mom, not doing so might feel like a rejection. He could even resent his brother for preventing it.\n\nI don't see how adopting Kai would make Lee feel left out if he doesn't want to be adopted? And I'm sure you'd always want to adopt him later on if he changes his mind?", "NTA, why is Lee's feelings irrelevant to his grandparents? You're literally being a good parent by respecting him in this. And yes, it sucks for Kai, but with continued reassurance that adoption is more a piece of paper and adult legal stuff and won't change how you feel about him this will be the better option out of a very difficult situation.", "NTA and I very much disagree with them saying it\u2019s terrible that you would \u201cmake one yours and discard the other like garbage\u201d when that isn\u2019t what the situation would be at all. If you do end up adopting one and not the other, that wouldn\u2019t be favoritism imo it would be respecting each child\u2019s respective wishes. If Lee maintains that he does not want to be adopted you not doing so would not be \u201cdiscarding\u201d him, it would be respecting him and his boundaries. It sounds like you\u2019re doing the best you can in a sticky situation. Grandparents might be too emotional and too close to the situation to be able to see logic. Best of luck to all of you.", "NTA and you are doing a great Job!!!", "NTA. You handled this beautifully.  Well done.", "NTA. Lee already has a mom and will grieve not having her forever. You are respecting him by not adopting him. \n\nYou are the only mom Kai knows, and all he wants is for it to be official. You are in a tough spot. \n\nIs there any way to have guardianship papers drawn up for Lee? That way it differentiates the relationships but shows you are responsible for both? You obviously care about the boys a great deal. You wouldn\u2019t be so worried about Lee\u2019s feelings if you didn\u2019t. \n\nYour in laws seem to care more about appearances than the boys. A 14 year old is old enough to say, I remember my mom, I didn\u2019t want to be adopted if other people bring it up to him.", "NTA OP.", "Nta although I think your husband is wrong to say no to adopting the child who *wants* to be adopted, you have 100% right to not force it on the child who does NOT want to be adopted.\n\nYour husband needs to firmly tell his parents that this topic is not up for discussion and if they continue to bring it up, they will no longer be allowed access to their grandchildren.", "I would also see about some king of legal guardianship for now, meaning that she can do medical appointments, etc. as well as some kind of security about shared custody in even of a  split, especially the youngest.\n\nNeed to discuss the legal guardianship with Oldest so they understand that its not adoption but provides another adult to be legally responsible, so can sign school paperwork, doctor stuff, vacation stuff etc. And provides a safety net should anything happen to the dad.", "Yeah that kid definitely doesn't want to be adopted. Your in-laws can hold whatever opinion they want but it doesn't match the reality of the situation or what the therapist recommended. If you try to force something it will go extremely poorly. You're doing a fantastic job imo. NTA.", "Make sure the aunt is willing and have this custody arrangement made legal. Your husband needs to realize that his boys don\u2019t see eye to eye. I bet Lee would appreciate your flexibility with his preferences. I don\u2019t see why they have to be treated the same. Adopt Kai now, adopt Lee later if he changes his mind.", "Have you considered seeing a lawyer and getting this set in stone? I'm sure there could be some kind of will written where they both can choose at that time, if the worst comes to pass. Then if something does happen, they're both already taken care of and you don't need to worry.", "I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s to do with Lee, and it coming between the boys. Although, the exact opposite could occur if Kai finds out that Lee is \u201cblocking\u201d the adoption.\n\nIMO, this is waaaay above reddits pay grade and following the professionals advice is not a bad plan. We simply don\u2019t know enough about the situation to give sound advice.", "So their reasoning for why it I'd a bad idea is because....it's harmful?", "I think you should reassure Kai that you're his mother no matter what a piece of paper says. He's too young to be thinking of legal stuff and the only way an adoption really matters is in a legal sense."]}
