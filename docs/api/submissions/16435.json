Kai has wanted me to adopt him for some time now and it was something discussed. The reason it has not happened is Lee does not want me to adopt him and my husband did not feel comfortable with me adopting only Kai. He's worried about it coming between the boys, about Lee maybe feeling left out eventually, but I think the main reason is he worries about the judgement of others and the fact the comments could get to both of the boys. I love both Lee and Kai. But my relationship with each of them is different. Kai is my son and we have a mother-son relationship. Lee is my stepson, who I love, but he doesn't always like that I'm here. Sometimes he gets annoyed that I'm here instead of his mom. Sometimes he treats me okay. But he has never been okay with me filling too much of his mom's role in his life. Our relationship is a delicate balancing act.\n\nThe boys have been in therapy. We also did therapy together as a family. My husband asked the therapist for their opinion on the adoption and she said we made the right decision and that when the boys get older (she said once the boys are around 10 and 16 respectively, and their feelings have not changed, then adopting just Kai could be okay.

But now they are aware of what is going on and they told me it's shameful that I have not adopted the boys and become their legal mother. They said Lee is depriving both himself and his brother of the legal protection of my being their mother and that I am showing clear favoritism by \"making it obvious\" I want to adopt Kai and not Lee. I asked them how I make that obvious and they ignored my question. They told me I should have jumped at the chance to be their mother. That it was monstrous to consider making one of them mine and discarding the other like yesterdays garbage. That angered me because I have always done my best. I ended up saying that they had no right to judge me for not adopting the boys because they have no idea what it's like to be a stepparent, and especially to stepchildren who have lost their biological parent to death, and they have no idea what it's like when both kids want different relationships with you.

You are doing things right, and taking the boys feelings and differing circumstances in to account. Good on you! Ignore the inlaws, and keep on keeping on.", "NTA - tell the in-laws to mind their business. Discuss with both boys what the plan for them would be if something happened to their dad. Explain if you adopted them they could stay with you as their mother, but if they were not adopted by you they would have to go elsewhere. This reality may help change Lee\u2019s mind.", "NTA! You do you. Adopting is not something that's open for a debate outside four people in your family: you, your husband, Kai and Lee.", "It's the inlaws business because _______? NTA", "NTA - I think your in-laws over stepped but is it possible you are favoring Kai to Lee? Do you know what they meant by you \u201cmaking it obvious\u201d?", "NTA but do speak with an attorney about living wills and advance directives. If anything were to happen to your stepkids at least there is documentation in place for you to make medical decisions on their behalf. If not your IL\u2019s can make a bad situation worse.", "NTA. It sounds like your ILs are making so many assumptions! You\u2019ve been thoughtful about how you are navigating this very difficult situation.", "NTA.\n\nYou are absolutely doing the right thing and your ILs are pressuring you for their own emotional reasons and/or to stir trouble in your families relationships.\n\nIf you've talked to both of the children and they are happy, and your husband and you are happy and you have a legal framework in place so that if anything happens to your husband the children would remain with you, then there is no reason to change it.\n\nYou aren't playing favourites, but Lee remembers his mother and his grief around his mothers death is inevitably tied to his interactions with you. Family therapy will help him, but he's a kid and he can't necessarily separate out all the emotions he's feeling. Kai doesn't remember her, and you've always been his mother, which makes it much easier for him.\n\nILs love judging more than helping I would guess, and just point out that you're acting in the interests of the emotional wellbeing of the family, who all have views the ILs aren't taking into account, including the children.\n\nForcing adoptions on teenagers is not a good move, and doing so could potentially destroy the family relationships. Waiting until Kai and Lee are older, and more reconciled and mature in their emotional intelligence and their relationship with you, is absolutely the right thing to do. Lee may never want to be adopted, and he's four years from being 18.\n\nDiscussing this in family therapy is a good idea, and allowing the children space to express their emotions without forcing the emotions of the wider family on them is the right thing to do. It's slow though and people love to rush to what they think is problem solved (replace deceased partner with a currently living partner literally and legally).\n\nAlso let your husband deal with the in-laws pressure, because it isn't fair on you to be solely responsible for a group decision and hounded about it.", "You in laws should NOT be involved.  it is NOT their nuclear family.\n\nThis is between you , your spouse and the boys.

They are not with you every day. They do not see the complexity in your life. They should mind there own f\\*\\*\\*ing business.\n\nIt seems very much, that you ILs have a very strong opinion, while not considering the feelings of every single person in your family... I mean it is clear, that both relationships are very different. Lee was 7 when his mother died, of course he does want a replacement... \n\nKai however, does not remember his mother, as hard as this sounds. You are his mother.\n\nRegardless of your ILs, your should however consider adopting Kai. If Lee feels left out, you can always adopt him at a later time - if he wishes. The point is this, every action - even no action - is a decision.\n\nWaiting is bad for Kai, because he wants to be adopted now.  \nAdopting only Kai, might be bad for Lee, because he feels left out  \nAdopting both might also be bad for Kai, because he feels is late mother gets replaced.\n\nRegardless what you do, there are consequences, you have to decide, which of the three options, has the smallest ones.

Especially seeing as my husband strongly agrees with it for right now.", "Lee would rather be with his maternal aunt if anything were to happen to my husband. That is something has has always been pretty clear on and it makes sense because she and their mom were close and she has been a big part of their lives and Lee gets extra comfort from her than he would from me in that scenario.

But in terms of where everyone is at they believe this is the best option for now.", "They do and I truly believe that. But unless they tell someone something like that, we cannot do anything about it. Kai has never expressed to anyone else, not even his therapist, that he doesn't like how I treat him or that I favor his brother. If anything he expresses when he feels like I have overstepped in some way and did something that should be left for his dad to do, or if I do something to mom-ish for him.", "Honestly I\u2019d just flat out ask them if Kai has said anything to them. It sounds like youre doing whats best for these boys though and it is not always the easiest.", "I might just ask my husband to, since they clearly do not want to communicate their reasoning with me. Maybe they will tell him something they won't tell me.

This whole thing is already not easy and my ILs saying what they did just added to the stress and worry I feel about our family.", "NTA. You are right. Your in laws are right to the extent that it is certain you are making \"mistakes\" with Lee, but wrong that the solution is some magic bullet of law. You have picked the path of risk aversion, that the consequences of being wrong are the least.\n\nIn any event you sought the advice of someone (the family therapist) whose job it is to speak for a deeper interest.", "NTA Buuut I do feel bad for Kai here. By being respectful of Lee, you're being disrespectful towards Kais feelings. He wants to be adopted, you're his mom, not doing so might feel like a rejection. He could even resent his brother for preventing it.\n\nI don't see how adopting Kai would make Lee feel left out if he doesn't want to be adopted? And I'm sure you'd always want to adopt him later on if he changes his mind?", "NTA, why is Lee's feelings irrelevant to his grandparents? You're literally being a good parent by respecting him in this. And yes, it sucks for Kai, but with continued reassurance that adoption is more a piece of paper and adult legal stuff and won't change how you feel about him this will be the better option out of a very difficult situation.", "NTA and I very much disagree with them saying it\u2019s terrible that you would \u201cmake one yours and discard the other like garbage\u201d when that isn\u2019t what the situation would be at all. If you do end up adopting one and not the other, that wouldn\u2019t be favoritism imo it would be respecting each child\u2019s respective wishes. If Lee maintains that he does not want to be adopted you not doing so would not be \u201cdiscarding\u201d him, it would be respecting him and his boundaries. It sounds like you\u2019re doing the best you can in a sticky situation. Grandparents might be too emotional and too close to the situation to be able to see logic.

You are respecting him by not adopting him. \n\nYou are the only mom Kai knows, and all he wants is for it to be official. You are in a tough spot. \n\nIs there any way to have guardianship papers drawn up for Lee? That way it differentiates the relationships but shows you are responsible for both? You obviously care about the boys a great deal. You wouldn\u2019t be so worried about Lee\u2019s feelings if you didn\u2019t. \n\nYour in laws seem to care more about appearances than the boys. A 14 year old is old enough to say, I remember my mom, I didn\u2019t want to be adopted if other people bring it up to him.", "NTA OP.", "Nta although I think your husband is wrong to say no to adopting the child who *wants* to be adopted, you have 100% right to not force it on the child who does NOT want to be adopted.\n\nYour husband needs to firmly tell his parents that this topic is not up for discussion and if they continue to bring it up, they will no longer be allowed access to their grandchildren.", "I would also see about some kind of legal guardianship for now, meaning that she can do medical appointments, etc. as well as some kind of security about shared custody in even of a  split, especially the youngest.\n\nNeed to discuss the legal guardianship with Oldest so they understand that its not adoption but provides another adult to be legally responsible, so can sign school paperwork, doctor stuff, vacation stuff etc. And provides a safety net should anything happen to the dad.", "Yeah that kid definitely doesn't want to be adopted. Your in-laws can hold whatever opinion they want but it doesn't match the reality of the situation or what the therapist recommended. If you try to force something it will go extremely poorly. You're doing a fantastic job imo. NTA.", "Make sure the aunt is willing and have this custody arrangement made legal. Your husband needs to realize that his boys don\u2019t see eye to eye. I bet Lee would appreciate your flexibility with his preferences. I don\u2019t see why they have to be treated the same. Adopt Kai now, adopt Lee later if he changes his mind.", "Have you considered seeing a lawyer and getting this set in stone? I'm sure there could be some kind of will written where they both can choose at that time, if the worst comes to pass. Then if something does happen, they're both already taken care of and you don't need to worry.", "I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s to do with Lee, and it coming between the boys. Although, the exact opposite could occur if Kai finds out that Lee is \u201cblocking\u201d the adoption.\n\nIMO, this is waaaay above reddits pay grade and following the professionals advice is not a bad plan. We simply don\u2019t know enough about the situation to give sound advice.", "So their reasoning for why it I'd a bad idea is because....it's harmful?", "I think you should reassure Kai that you're his mother no matter what a piece of paper says. He's too young to be thinking of legal stuff and the only way an adoption really matters is in a legal sense.", "NTA - you guys are doing a great job! This is some of the most sensitive, considerate, kind hearted, and sensible parenting I've heard about, particularly with stepkids and on Reddit! You ILs need to butt out, might be a good idea to go LC with them until your family makes definite decisions about adoption.", "YTA.  Lee is old enough to have a serious conversation on this topic. Surely he does not want his brother to be sad. There's no reason you can't adopt Kai and not Lee. You would be honoring both of their wishes. They are different ages and have had vastly different life experiences.", "NTA. It\u2019s a delicate situation.", "NTA, your ILs I presume are elderly folks. Let them say what they will, smile and nod.", "NTA - and you're doing a fantastic job as a step parent. You aren't forcing a relationship, you're listening to their needs, and you and your husband are communicating within your own relationship separate from the kids. \n\nYour in-laws need to respect that. Hell, they should congratulate you on being a fab step-mom.", "NTA. The ILs are the only AHs here. Forcing an adoption on a child is a recipe for disaster. And could cause problems between the siblings as well. Not just you.  Im curious if they liked the kids late mother? And maybe want her \nforgotten?\n\n  I do think your husband needs to have a talk with his parents though.", "NTA. Several step kids have had posts here about the trauma of being adopted against their will, or being forced to call stepparents Mom/Dad. You are showing care for Lee by respecting his wishes. It\u2019s ok for kids to have different relationships with you, as long as both kids are getting what they need and respect each other\u2019s choices. \n\nI do hope that Lee is supported in remembering his mother, and that Kai is told stories about her.", "Don't worry, op, you're winning the step parent tight rope. You're doing what's right for the boys. Plus, you and hubs are communicating with the boys and therapy. \n\nIn-laws are probably looking at optics and making assumptions about how you relate to each child. They do not see that you're being sensitive to both and how they want to interact. Sometimes the older generation way is to bulldoze things over, and that never worked! \n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nIt's a good thing your ILs have never been stepparents as they would have made a mess of it. You're doing it just right.", "NTA - grand parents are way over the line.", "Wow NTA your inlawd sound awful. Even if they were step parents themselves that doesn't give them any right to push their opinions on you. Based on everything you said I agree with the therapist's suggestion. Wait and if they still want that then go for it. Adopting wither or both of the boys against their wishes would be so much worse than waiting until everyone was certain.", "NTA and your IL's absolutely are. You don't need to talk to them, since they are being so dense and insulting. They don't seem to care that their grandson does not **want** to be adopted. You and your husband are showing his children respect. Their grandparents are showing their impatience. They can just stay mad.", "NTA\n\nJust wondering if you're in the USA? Adoption isn't as common in other countries is all.", "NTA", "NTA - and frankly I have so much respect for you, for having that stance. I am a step parent, I am also a stepchild. Being a stepchild for me was a horrible experience my dad pretty much forgot my sister and I existed once he got married to someone else and had kids. We have never been a priority in his life. I think you guys are doing a phenomenal job, and I get that having a different relationship with both children, it happens.", "NTA. You're doing the right thing. Forcing the adoption on Lee will only cause issues. Give it a couple more years and see where the boys are at. Your pushy in laws need to mind their own business.", "NTA, maybe ask your Husband for more help in dealing with his parents, to back off. It\u2019s a sensitive subject already, but what you are doing sounds like you are trying to navigate it properly.", "NTA\n\nOur relationships with our parents are very complex, and by extension, so are the relationships between stepchild and stepparent. People who\u2019ve never been part of a step family don\u2019t understand just how complicated in can be. Even when the adult and child get along very well, that child may not want that adult to be their parent. And that\u2019s ok. It would break whatever trust exists between you and Lee if you forced yourself into a role he doesn\u2019t want you have.", "Nta", "NTA - but your hubby should have a will naming you as the boy\u2019s guardian if he died. This would protect the boys from being uprooted if their dad died too but without the emotional issues that you have in the current situation.", "NTA you are giving both kids what they need, there is a huge age gap, needs are not the same.", "NAH but absolutely GET YOUR WILLS/GUARDIANSHIP IN ORDER.  There\u2019s another post on here from a few days ago with an older sister trying to rip custody of a 9yr old away from step-mom who\u2019s been the boy\u2019s mother since he was under a year old.  Older sister always prevented step-mom from formally adopting the boy.  DON\u2019T let that step-mom be you.", "NTA.  Repeat after me, OP:  \"I'm not going to discuss this with you, MIL/FIL.  It's none of your business.\"  Say that whenever they bring it up.", "NTA\n\nHuh. Funny coincidence. Lost my dad at 2. Mom married my stepfather when I was 3. She had him adopt me at age 9 \"in case anything ever happened to her\". He DID NOT adopt my 14yr old sister. \"She is old enough that if anything happened she would be okay\". He was abusive so I suspect there was some 'she didnt want him to' things in there. But who the heck tells young kids those things? Lol\n\nUltimately nothing changed. We stayed sisters. Family stayed the same. When my mom (prophetically) died when I was 13 I had a legal parent. My sister had moved out at 18. No one cared that he adopted one of us and not both.", "OP all I can say is that your respect for the wishes of both of these boys is truly wonderful. You respected that the oldest was not wanting that and needing time, and still appears to feel that way. I think it\u2019s coming time though to sit down with him and ask him if it\u2019s ok to start the process with younger DH and tell him again he also has a choice. If anyone questions this or thinks you are wrong to adopt one then let them know that you respect them both and love them both equally abs because of that you are honoring his with to remain the step parent so he is always the legal child of his deceased mom.

They are way out of line.\n\nThe only people with opinions that matter here are you, your husband and the two boys. The therapist seems sensible.", "Only 4 people get a say and in laws aren't in that 4.

Definitely talk with both boys separately and explain that the legal guardianship is all about helping Dad and making sure that she can help them if they need it. Then you\u2019ll have protection from both emergencies and in-laws\u2026.", "I wonder if maybe the in-laws don't like the idea of possibly 'losing' Lee to his mother's family if something were to happen to your husband? That may be why they're pushing for you to adopt both the kids, even though it's clearly not what Lee wants, because they feel like you'd be less likely to stop them seeing him than the maternal aunt?", "Get this in writing in your wills/guardianship papers.  Do it yesterday.  Seriously.  Your older step-son is approaching 18 and you don\u2019t want him to be like another Redditor on here who is trying to rip her brother away from the step mom who\u2019s raised him since he was under a year old, but was never allowed to adopt because the sister didn\u2019t like her.", "Huh? I thought Kai wanted you to adopt him though?", "I agree. I think you need to address how they communicate with you at some point if this is how they do it.", "NTA\n\nThank you for not pushing your own wishes on these two boys and letting them dictate their own boundaries with their relationship with you. You are doing a great job and being a stepparent is a very difficult and sometimes thankless role that others like to judge too easily.", "NTA. It isn\u2019t often we see a step parent respecting boundaries. You are doing what\u2019s right for the boys and your family, not just doing something for appearance sake.", "NTA. You're actually putting the boys first. That being said, should anything happen to their father, he needs to update his will to name whoever is most appropriate to take care of the boys. You won't automatically be granted guardianship. \n\nThe therapist and your husband want to wait, so ya'll should wait.", "Share with them all the posts on Reddit forums where stepparents rushed the kids to adoption or parents who pushed for stepparents to adopt and how it ruined the relationship with the kids.

You're listening to the kids and centering their feelings.", "Your IL's are butting in where their opinion hasn't been asked.  I would basically ignore them.  You have a relationship with each of these boys that 'works', good for you.  Later things may change where both boys want you to adopt both of them, maybe not.  But it's none of the IL's business what you and your husband do in your marriage, not theirs.  NTAH.", "NTA\n\nThe boys were at different stages of life when you came into their lives, so there is no one size fits all answer.    \nYou are willing to adopt and would love to, but the time is not yet right.  Soon it might be.  Makes sense to me.  They had a mother, and now they have a second chance to have a mother.  It is their decision to accept you as Mom or Bonus Mom and their decision as to the relationship they want. \n\nAdoption doesn\u2019t make you the parent.  Your attitude and relationship does.", "NTA\n\n> They said Lee is depriving both himself and his brother of the legal protection of my being their mother\n\nLegal protections can be put in place without adoption, which erases the legal connection to their mother and that side of the family. (In many jurisdictions the birth certificate is altered. So if you do move forward with adopting Kai at some point, you should get copies of the original birth certificate for them.)\n\nHonestly it sounds like your IL\u2019s are completely dismissive of Lee\u2019s feelings. They have a fantasy in their heads and are saying you are wrong for not meeting that fantasy. Including an imagined narrative that you are driving how the relationship is defined. (Probably because you are the adult - which again is dismissive of children have their own opinions.)\n\nFwiw, I also think it\u2019s important to wait until Kai is a little older anyway - he\u2019s still a little young to understand the full legal implications of adoption.", "NTA. You have done very well OP. Thank you for respecting the children\u2019s wishes and consulting and listening to a professional.

He\u2019s grieving his mother and doesn\u2019t want his little brother to be \u201cyours\u201d because of it.  And it\u2019s okay.\n\nYou are doing wonderful and I\u2019m happy these kids have you in their lives.  \n\nDon\u2019t listen to your in laws.", "NTA.  Your ILs though.....ya.  You're doing the best you can in a tricky situation.", "NTA.", "NTA.  You have to do what works for your family situation, period.  Others don't get a say in it and should keep their mouths shut.", "NTA \nignore the in laws \nThey don\u2019t get it and have never been through it \n\nNow for some advice \n\nI think lee is old enough to be sat down and talked about this in a more adult conversation \nA conversation where he can be told \n\u201c I want to adopt both you and your brother, you are a son to me and I would love to make it legal if you would want that, if you don\u2019t want that I fully understand and you have full choice and control in the matter. That being said I am also going to have an age appropriate conversation with your little brother about adopting him, I don\u2019t want his choice to affect your choice or yours to affect him and I also don\u2019t want it to create resentment later between us or you two. If you don\u2019t want to be adopted, would you still be okay with me adopting your brother ?\u201d\nAnd listen to him \ntalk to him and understand him \nAnd go from that conversation \ndo not deprive yourself and Kai of that step just because his brother isn\u2019t there yet, lee can be adopted at anytime if he chooses \nKai wants to be adopted, he has chosen you as his mom \nIf lee isn\u2019t there that\u2019s okay they don\u2019t have to be at the same place \nAnd I think lee is old enough to understand that it\u2019s not choosing favorites if you give him the option as wel, if you are enthusiastic about adopting him as well", "Nta. They do have two mothers. You being there, understanding the delicate balance and parenting Lee IS mothering. It doesn\u2019t need to be legal to be legal for it to be true. Of course lee is a bit resentful, losing a parent is trauma and having a very excellent replacement parent doesn\u2019t remove that trauma. You are a special person, but he had someone as his Mom. You are his loving parent. It\u2019s the same but also holds space for the lady that he knew that died.\n\nIf it comes up again I\u2019d say \u201cthanks for your opinion. Lee doesn\u2019t see the need for legal adoption and holds his deceased mother as the only person who will be his Mother. I\u2019m a great parent, I understand that and this is what works for us and we support Lee. It\u2019s uncomfortable you keep bringing this up.\u201d And then excuse yourself from the room and go do something else. And repeat each time it comes up.", "NTA, they say you show favouritism, but respecting someone's boundaries isn't showing favouritism. What might be a good idea is to have a talk with Lee that your IL's said that they think you are showing favouritism towards Kai. Ask if he feels that way too (and tell before this that all answers are okay). You can follow this up with if he would like to see some changes to your relationship with him or if he would like it to stay the same going forward. Maybe saying that you sometimes unsure how to behave because you don't want to replace his mom may help getting some understanding for each other", "NTA, you and your husband are doing fabulous parenting. I hope that you both discuss the IL's an no unsupervised visits. The amount of pressure on Lee from them will create some serious issues and Lee doesn't deserve that. It is fantastic you are respecting his wishes and his connection to his mother. At some point though, Lee will need to understand his desires do not trump his brothers. Lee can't choose for Kai and Kai cannot choose for Lee. I hope that Lee sees that you are not trying to shove his mother out of their lives or erase her by adopting Kai. Lee can always change his mind at any point in his life if he chooses and you are open. LC with the IL's may be best for now.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re respecting the boys and their individual needs. Their grandparents views are archaic and wrong.", "NTA. You are doing what's best for you and the boys. And you are not playing favorites. Playing favorites would have been to adopt Kai at an early age without listening to Lee. This shows you care about both boys equally and want them both to be cared for properly and to do what's best for both of them. Not just one.", "NTA\n\nStepparenting is a thankless thankless position to be in.", "NTA. You also don't have to be an in-law to know that an in-law is overstepping and talking out of their ass.", "Why are they saying any of this when one of the kids had plainly stated he doesn't Want you to adopt him?\n\nMakes no sense.

They also have no right to weigh in on the relationship you have with your (step)children, especially when one of them has set very clear boundaries.", "Lmao your in-laws are hilarious.\nI would have had such a hard time not laughing in their faces at that last line. NTA at all and keep being a great step parent. Maybe level with Kai that you want to adopt him but you don't want to accidentally hurt Lee, let Kai know it's okay to feel different than his brother and his feelings are just as valid, and you not adopting him right now is only a step towards making everyone is happy and making sure everyone's feelings are valid.\n\n Maybe make a big thing about creating memories for an eventual mommy and me book you give him when you adopt him so he knows it's still happening and gets excited for it in the future?", "NTA and tell your ILs to piss off. Honestly don\u2019t put up with their BS", "NTA. You and your husband are trying to do the right thing by both boys. Your inlaws'would be terrible srep parents. It's sad that Kai has to wait, but as long as he understands that the ultimate answer is yes,and Lee understands that it is ultimately His Choice. AND your husband has already drawn up the legal paperwork naming you guardian of the boys should the worst happen....Then you have done the right thing.", "NTA . NOT at all!  Read these columns long enough and you'll see hundreds of stories just like yours from all perspectives.  Kids whose parents have died often do not want to be adopted. They want a step-parent and family memory and respect for their birth parent.  Other kids want to be adopted.  The worst thing you can do is force kids either way. \n\nYou are not discarding one child who wants you as a step parent only. You are not favoring the other by wanting to adopt.   I think  allowing the kids to make their own choices when they are old enough is the best move.\n\nTell your IL that a professional in family dynamics gave you advice and you are taking it. You love both kids and they know it.  \n\nAlso, your younger child can certainly consider you his mom with or without adoption.  It sounds like you are doing a fantastic job, honestly.", "Where is your husband in all of this? HE needs to deal with them", "Telling you you should adopt your step kids a month into the marriage makes about as much sense as saying you should marry your roommate. Adoption should be the commemoration and recognition of a relationship *that already exists*.\n\nNTA", "NTA for giving your opinion. They aren't AH's for giving their opinion either. They can't force you to do anything, so thank them for their opinion and just tell them that your opinion is different and do things your way.
