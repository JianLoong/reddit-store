I'm very new to Reddit.\n\nI (27m) used to work at a popular local coffee shop. I quit a few years ago to pursue other passions, but recently came back. Previously, I had a great friendship with my coworkers and our regular customers. I love to talk with our regulars, it's one of my favourite parts of the day. Makes me feel like life is a movie.\n\nNow that you're all caught up, I'll introduce the problem. While I was gone, a girl who we'll call Marie (fake name, 16f) joined.\n\nNo problem with that. She's sweet, and everyone treats her as if she was their younger sister or daughter- even the customers. She just gets on my nerves because it's like she *knows* that everyone loves her.\n\nNow, Marie is allergic to nuts and freaks out when hazelnut syrup gets on her. She refuses to make drinks with almond or soy milk/acts all sad when customers bring doughnuts because she can't have them. I think she's being dramatic, but then again, I don't have any food allerges.\n\nAnyways, we were pretty busy last Friday after school, my girlfriend came in to study, and I took her order. Marie was the only one making drinks because we were short-staffed and the other barista was on break, but she's an experienced barista at this point, and should've been fine. The only other employee was wearing a headset and taking orders through the window.\n\nI was having a nice talk with my girlfriend when Marie came up to me and asked if she could take care of the rest of the line while I swapped her and made the drinks. I asked her why and she said it was because three of them had either hazelnut syrup or almond milk in them.\n\nHere's where I may have been the AH:\n\nObviously, I told her no. and to just go get some gloves on and make them. I told her that she would be fine, because she would. She's not going to have a reaction just because she touches a tiny bit of it. If she was, why would she be working here? I'm allergic to cobalt, but you don't see me complaining about not having a tattoo.\n\nShe went and asked the coworker on headsets to trade before proceeding to tell him what I told her. They traded, and he came over to me to tell me I was an AH and needed to apologise.\n\nMy girlfriend told me that what I did was perfectly acceptable. I think what I did is perfectly fine. Marie needed to know that the world wasn't gonna change for her just because she has an allergy. But word spreads fast through shifts and all of my coworkers say otherwise. I'm starting to feel like I might have overreacted.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit because of spelling", "created_utc": 1668540509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw727z/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_no/", "score": 188, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If there is a way for her to safely handle materials that she is allergic to, (gloves) then she should be afforded those (she is).

Also, you did this when the place was busy and understaffed, yet you somehow have time to socialize with your girlfriend. Even if she is bs-ing all this, you're bringing negativity to the workplace, which seems to have already made you the AH to your coworkers, no matter what commenters think, and their opinion should weigh more as they're the ones that are going to have to work with the both of you. Are there enough employees that you could be scheduled for different shifts?\n\nETA: It's also not your place to judge or question why she works there, whether it's any of the reasons you listed as to why you like working there, or out of necessity or preference.

If you cant handle nuts due to health issues, don't work somewhere where you're going to be required to handle nuts. I know of a guy who applied for a stocking position at a very large retail store.

Why he applied for a position like that is beyond me but some people just do not think at all..", "YTA.  Sure, maybe she's being a bit dramatic about her allergy, but you already said you were pretty busy and short-staffed at the moment, so why are you wasting time chatting up your girlfriend instead of working? And regardless of whether or not her allergy is as severe as you describe or not, you could have just been nice and helped her out.", "NTA. The audacity of these people.

If her allergy is that severe she shouldn\u2019t be working there. If it isn\u2019t, you\u2019re not wrong in saying she could easily use gloves.

Why is she working at a coffee shop where she might be exposed to nuts? she can put on gloves and she\u2019ll be fine.", "ESH.\n\nSure, she does sound mildly attention seeking, but she knows her allergy better than you do. You should just admit the reason you didn't want to is because you were too busy flirting with your girlfriend while you were working, which you shouldn't have been.", "If all your coworkers say otherwise then I think you've got your answer. If they think you're the asshole, sounds like your new work culture is a lot more sensitive to her needs than you are", "YTA- allergies are a serious thing and even though she may not be fatally allergic you could\u2019ve just made those few drinks for her.", "YTA. Do your job instead of chatting up your girlfriend.", "Info- What kind of allergy are we talking here? Can she not eat them, or does touching them cause issues?\n\nDepending on the nature of the allergy, you need to make accommodations for her.", "ESH. You for being in some kind of weird work-rivalry with a 16-year-old kid and your whole attitude towards her. Her for either taking a job she can't perform due to her allergies, or acting up her allergies to get out of working. \n\nThat being said, it doesn't sound like either of you have any authority over the other, so what you need to do is talk to your manager and ask how they want everyone to handle Marie's allergies. Either they'll tell her that she can't perform her duties, or they'll create a system that allows her to work around her allergies, but that way you'll know what to do in the future.", "YTA. First of all, why on earth would you be so personally butthurt by someone\u2019s allergy? She may well have an official accommodation in place that allows her to avoid those products, in which case you\u2019ll be hearing from HR.", "YTA you have no idea how bad her allergies are. What happens if the drink splashes on her and her airway closes? That's an extreme example but you don't know what could happen. It also sounds like you're bitter that you're no longer the star barista and are taking it on her.", "Yes you are TA. You're not there to talk to your gf. You're there to work.

There are ppl who have reactions from being in the same room as certain nuts. I\u2019m so over ppl thinking allergic ppl are just \u2018difficult\u2019 or making it up.

And there are stations that are more desirable, so stores like to rotate so the same people don\u2019t get continually stuck in the undesirable stations and get mad and quit.\n\nIt sounds like OP was tired of her switching from an undesirable station (drink making) and having other people do it while she got to do the easier jobs when it was their turn for that station.\n\nI completely understand OP\u2019s frustration and have seen people quit for less.", "She's touched it before according to OP, well it's fallen on her and she was fine", "I agree that it doesn\u2019t seem malicious at all, especially at her age it\u2019s reasonable that she doesn\u2019t have great problem solving skills. I will say though that it seems like it would be difficult to work as a barista in this day and age if you can\u2019t handle nut based products (milks, syrups, and even food items). If she\u2019s been at the job for awhile they should have found reasonable accommodations by now that allow her to do the job like gloves or only assigning her to duties that won\u2019t come into contact with the food. That\u2019s partially on the business and her managers though.", "Or OP is reading her \"freak out\" as emotional, not bothering to notice if it's an actual reaction just because she's not reacting like people do in the movies.", "But where did it fall? Her skin or clothes? There are too many variables missing.", "When she is  using gloves  doesn't matter as it is a layer between  the skin and the allergen  and she can be around it .", "Yta. She proubly will survive if hazelnut gets on her hand but it proubly irritates her skin. Also like I'm pretty sure the only places that hires minors is fast food places. So she has no choice but to just deal with it and take what job she can get. \n\nAlso you where just sitting around chatting with your gf leaving the 17 y/o to do all the work that makes you double the asshole.\n\nAlso also I promise you the 17 y/o isn't manipulating you by asking you to make a drink that has nuts in it or by being said that she can't have a donut cuz of cross contamination. She's 17 your 27 get over it.", "Another commenter pointed this out too but.....what the heck is with the doughnuts part. Doughnuts aren't called that because they have nuts in them.", ">Marie needed to know that the world wasn't gonna change for her just because she has an allergy.\n\nNo, because apparently the world only changes for a grown ass adult chatting with his girlfriend on the clock like a high schooler while *actual* high schoolers pick up the slack during a rush.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYTA, grow up, and stop having weird animosities with kids.", "Losing my mind over all the comments defending OP.\n\nYTA 100%. You have no right to minimize someone\u2019s allergy, especially since you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have a food allergy. And no, comparing that to a tattoo is not fair.\n\nShe is doing her job, and it wasn\u2019t like she walked away and refused to make the drinks. She offered to switch tasks. She is not lazy, and you can not call her dramatic for not even knowing the severity or reactions to the allergy.\n\nThere is no reason to try to put your coworker into a dangerous situation because you are jealous and want to talk to your gf. Again, YTA.", "NTA", "were you on a break that you were talking tonyour GF? or you just used company time to have some downtime with your girl?", "I'm allergic to strawberry seeds(weird I know) but I've worked in restaurants all my working life. Cutting and serving fresh fruit came with the territory. A lot of the times it would include fresh strawberries. We weren't required to wear gloves but handwashed and all. I told my boss about my allergy and he asked if I could do it with gloves on, I said yes and that was that. Unless you are deathly allergic, you can't touch the product. The fact she can be around these items means she can easily do the job with gloves. Honestly, she's trying to get people to do her job.", "YTA\n\nYou were chatting with your girlfriend", "Yeah, I was wondering about that too. Who made up this story? An android who thinks doughnuts are called that because they are made of nuts? what gives", "I meant agreed upon in that everyone has done/does this switch when those drinks come. Not sure if this time, when OP said no, was the first time she asked or if he's done the switch before but this is the first time he said no.", "Exactly. And when you choosing to exercise your prerogative changes how the team has **been** functioning out of nowhere, in the **middle** of a shift that is busy and understaffed, as opposed to say at a meeting or in talking to the person that is in charge of making such changes in protocol, because you don't want to do your job (and you're not the one who's supposed to be on break), that makes YTA.", "Switching tasks with another employee is a reasonable accommodation. It's listed in \"suggested accommodations\" that employers are given during ADA training. The manager should have made it formal though, and educated the employees working with her so they're aware of the accommodation. I've worked in places and taken higher ed classes where it was assumed that my coworkers/classmates wouldn't be asshats and thus the managing authority didn't formalize my accommodations, which is what may be happening here. \n\nClearly that isn't working, and hopefully someone helps her make a formal request and the manager responds by formally educating her coworkers.", "ESH- you were on the clock, and that's shitty to leave both coworkers to do all the work while you chat with your GF. Marie is also not great here because the allergies don't add up. Most commercial coffee shops don't use syrups with actual nuts in them, they just have flavorings. The most popular hazelnut syrups contain no nuts and are considered nut allergy friendly.  Soy is a legume and not considered a tree nut allergen at all, but in very rare cases can coincide with a peanut allergy (5%). Almonds are a risk for a nut allergy, but only when ingested or extended topical exposure. So there's a chance she's exaggerating, but she also might be trying to be careful, and has multiple allergy triggers. \n\nIn the end she might be obnoxious, but you're 10 yrs older than her and weren't doing your job, so you both kinda suck here.", "NTA.  She\u2019s just lazy.", "You may want to reexamine your animosity toward her, which seems to be playing a part in all this.  As an aside you express disdain for her because she apparently knows everyone loves her.  First, she's a literal kid. So maybe ease up on her a bit? Were you different at 16 than you are now? Second, are you jealous of her and the fact that \"your\" regulars love her? Or are you not recognizing that she's young? I don't know, but this animosity is bigger than the allergy issue.\n\nYou can use your words and talk to her about her safety and what's okay and what's not.  If her allergies are interfering with getting the job done, then talk to your manager about how to work around that.", "Info \n\nWas it your break?", "YTA. You're on the clock, do the job.", "YTA. Has it occurred to you that her stress and worry over getting a nut product on her might be to do with a previous anaphylactic shock so she's scared of doing anything to risk another one? Or that she's 16 and it's her first time in the wider world and she may just be scared about managing her allergy on her own whereas previously parents would have handled it and protected her?\n\nYou sound unpleasant and unkind. It wouldn't have hurt you to swap roles and just have some patience and sympathy with a young girl who is clearly a bit scared of her allergy. It may be unreasonable but again, she's 16.", "Im scratching my head at that too. Many commentators are missing that part.", "OP was at the counter serving the line. It's possible to do that and have a chat with someone.", "If you work at a cafe and can't be around almond milk, you can't do your job.", "She's 16 and sounds anxious about managing her allergy which may lead her to being over cautious. OP is 27 and stood chatting to.his girlfriend.", "Isn't Marie asking to swap *changing how the team functions*? They already have assigned roles."]}
