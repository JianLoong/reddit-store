Milly's father died before she was born. Laila had promised to send money for me to take care of Milly and that'd she'd call and visit as often as she could until she could take Milly to live with her permanently.\n\nAfter she left, she called probably 3 times in the first two months and then went awol. For years I'd tried to find out what happened and assumed the worst, only to hear from one of her friends a couple of years later that she got married to someone else and has an entire new family. I was heartbroken because Milly would ask when her mom was coming back and I never knew what to say except \"soon\". But even she grew tired of it and realized when she was about 8 that her mom wasn't coming back anytime soon, that's if she was coming back at all. Because of this situation, me and my wife were granted parental rights to Milly and she couldn't have been happier that we were officially her parents. \n\nWell, what do you know, after 11 years, Laila finally graced us with her long overdue return last week, along with her new very wealthy family and 2 children. Most of the family was happy with her return but me, my mom, dad, and my wife were nothing short of furious. She tried to explain but all that we heard was \" I abandoned my own daughter and made a new family\". \n\nAs if that wasn't enough, she practically demanded her daughter back. Mom and dad weren't having it at all and told her Milly belongs with me and my wife and that she no longer has any right to her. Welp, there she goes screaming at me about stealing her daughter because I was infertile and to hear that come out from her mouth hurt me in a way I've never been hurt before to the point where I cried and left. Me being infertile has always been my weak point and for her to casually bring it up like that despite being my sister broke me. For the next days, I prevented her from contacting Milly and I haven't told her that Laila is back because I'm scared I'll lose my daughter. I'm a human being too, I get attached, especially to someone I've had to raise, that too out of my own pocket, not that I'm complaining. I believe Milly is my daughter and I can't let her go back to the very same woman who abandoned her.\n\nDoes this make me TA?\n\nEdit: I'd like to thank each and everyone of you. All your criticism is valid and I really appreciate you guys for making me realize that I might lose my daughter by keeping the return of her mom away from her. \n\nI'd also like to apologize for the way I phrased some of the things. By no means do I think of my daughter as some possession, she is her own person and doesn't belong to anyone. As such I've changed the Phrase \"belong to\" to \"belong with\" to accurately represent what was meant.\n\nI love you guys for all the support you've given me and I definitely will consult a lawyer. Me and my wife have agreed to tell Milly about her mother tonight and we will make sure it's all about how she feels and not about us.", "created_utc": 1669464048, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z55x30/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_daughter_back_to_her/", "score": 5102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Explain the dynamics that 1) she is your daughter and always will be. 2) Bio-Mom is back. 3) She can have as much of a relationship with Bio-Mom as she wants, but that she's always your child and cannot live with Bio Mom, cannot defer to Bio Mom in any parental capacity, and that Bio Mom has some skeletons in the closet and is NOT a trusted adult. \n\nDon't point out that Milly is said skeleton in the closet, but that you know first hand that Bio Mom made some incredibly bad life choices that shows that she isn't someone that can be trusted with children and Milly's safety comes first - physical, emotional all of it.", "NTA. You are Milly's father now, legally and emotionally. She is not an object to be passed around because suddenly this other person finds it convenient. However, you need to be completely honest with Milly about all of this - she WILL find out one way or another, and keeping this from her will only damage your credibility with her.  Be accurate and truthful about what her bio-mother has done, but do it without badmouthing her as much as possible. Often children put their bio-parents on a pedestal and will hold it against you if you talk disparagingly about them. Consider getting some family counseling so that Milly can work through some of these issues with a 'neutral' third party that will guide her through this emotional baggage.\n\nEdit: apologies, changed mother to father", "NTA. You should not hide this from Milly. She will find out one day and resent you for it.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like a piece of work. But look, you need to let Milly know she's here.

She did nothing to raise her for past 11 years and your parental rights are legal. With that said, Milly is about 14 now?

She's also old enough that she could be in the stage of if she wants to do something and you don't let her, she will probably do it behind your back.\n\nSit down with Milly and talk to her, ascertain what she thinks of the matter and you would have won against Laila easily. 14 is old enough to have opinions about things that affect her even if she doesn't always make the best choices due to a lack of life experience.", "My heart goes out to you and your daughter and family.

I understand you want to protect both your daughter and your own feelings from any possible conflict or upset, but Milly will find out eventually, and if it doesn\u2019t come from you, it could possibly hurt your relationship more than bio-mum\u2019s return. Sit down and have a conversation with Milly, let her know that bio-mum has returned, but let her know that you\u2019re still her parent, you\u2019ll always be here for her no matter what, that you raised her and no matter what blood relation you are, you love and adore and respect her like a daughter. Let her make up her own mind about if she wants a relationship with bio-mum, but make it perfectly clear that you have parental rights because Bio Mum made some pretty piss poor life decisions (maybe word it a bit better \ud83d\ude02) and that you only have Milly\u2019s best interest at heart.\n\nJust support your daughter however she wants to proceed, she will find out eventually what her bio mum is like, probably when she meets bio mum\u2019s new family and realises that she straight up abandoned Milly in favour of a new family.\n\n\nI wish you and Milly all the best, and i hope everything goes smoothly\n\nEDIT: added \u201cbio\u201d in front of mum", "Does - does your sister seem to think Milly is her childhood bike, or an old toy!??\n\nNO.

And she is wealthy so she has that tool to use as well. \n\nYou need to talk to Milly now and explain what is happening. Because if you don't Laila will show up at school, your house, or driving down the street and ambush Milly. She can tell Milly that you are the bad person, that she sent letters and gifts regularly and you kept them from her. She can make up any story she wants and hope that something gains traction. She might even decide to take her and go back to where she came from. After all, she is Milly's \"real\" parent, not you who loved and cared for her for over a decade. Hopefully, all of your legal ducks are in a row. I would contact a lawyer now and discuss the matter with them and see what can be done to head off any legal challenge. But unless Laila surrendered her parental rights, my guess is that she has a legal right to re-insert herself into Milly's life.

Let her know that you're sorry she has to grow up a little faster than other 14 year olds because of this situation, but you think she has a right to know what's happening. Then be as absolutely honest as you can about the situation; let her know that you only want what is best for her, and that you love her forever, whatever the outcome may be. Then mentally prepare yourself for whatever may come (as best as you can) and mentally walk through how you could support, love and be there for her regardless of circumstances (whether the courts decide that she lives with biomom, or live with you, or have split custody, etc). Walk through different scenarios, mentally, like, close your eyes and imagine a specific scenario, how you'd support Milly, how you'd show your love, how you'd be there for her; doing these mental exercises can really help you formulate responses and plans prior to emotion charged situations coming up in the future.

This is a stranger now, coming back and making demands.  Those demands aren't about your daughter and her needs, but about your sister and her wants.  That's a huge red flag of danger** for your child, that her mother is coming back and expects to just have the child handed back into her control.  \n\n**IF the relationship between birth mother and child is going to be re-established, it needs to be done slowly.**  It needs to be done at the pace that your child is comfortable with, not pressured, not demanded, not on the timetable for the adults.  Especially with there being plenty of money involved, it's possible that this could be used to bribe your child into choosing quickly, and finding out later that the situation isn't what she thought it was, or that she was lied to.   It's possible that your sister is looking for a nanny for her other children, and is looking for someone she can have total control over, or some other reason for suddenly wanting your daughter back.  If this is the case, she's not going to admit it.   \n\n**Your sister's history isn't a good one, not for your child.  There should be years of rebuilding a relationship with her birth mother, before even beginning to consider going to visit for a few weeks during the summer, let alone moving in with her.** You and your child have no reason to trust your sister.  Quite the opposite, sister has shown by her actions that she cannot be trusted.  So, to protect your child, it's reasonable that you set a pace that limits contact so that your child isn't pressured.  **Your child should not be expected to make a decision to move in with her birth mother at this point,** because your sister has not proven that she can be trusted not to abandon this child again, or worse.   **At this point, the only decision your child should need to make about your sister is whether to have one meeting with the sister, supervised.** \n\nWaiting, being slow, taking very deliberate steps, and doing it all to protect your child is how to do this.   There should be rules and supervision, by a neutral party at all meetings, because a teen can't see through all the manipulations.   Such as, no bribes, no promises of \"if you live with me, you get this stuff\".  No demands that a weekly meeting happen, but a visit arrangement where the child gets to go home, think, process, ask questions, find out if your sister is telling truth or lies, and then thinking about when another visit might be okay.  No pressure.  If your child needs three months between visits, that's what she ought to have.\n\nIf your sister can't agree to slowly rebuild the relationship, then she's got some other motivation than a healthy relationship.  If your sister is in a rush, then she's not thinking of your child's needs and the damage that your sister did by abandoning her the first time.  \n\nThis whole situation is filled with red flags for your child.

Many 14 year olds have been exposed to more \u201cugly truths\u201d than some privileged, out-of-touch adults who are pampered their entire lives. Plenty of teenagers experience all kinds of trauma, abuse, assault, poverty, and yes, all different forms of abandonment. The child in question has already experienced an extreme form of abandonment from her mother. She knows one ugly truth quite well. And she might try to chase her deadbeat mother\u2019s love, but not because she\u2019s a naive child \u2014 on average, it takes adults who end up in abusive relationships SEVEN tries to leave their abusers. Both men & women struggle to leave partners who mistreat, neglect, or abandon them off & on. This is not something only teenagers do.\n\nBeing an adult & experiencing \u201cugly truths\u201d does not mean that adults never yearn to believe that the inconsistent, narcissistic people in their lives are capable of change. And being a young teenager doesn\u2019t mean that she will definitely try to chase her deadbeat mother\u2019s love just because she\u2019s a naive kid. People respond differently to abandonment\u2014 age is not the issue that determines how someone will respond in a situation like this. And she doesn\u2019t determine whether or not someone has seen the \u201cugly truths\u201d of life (and this isn\u2019t even touching on all the young children who have experienced war & mass violence as refugees, or all the children who have witnessed school shootings, etc.) \n\nShe\u2019s been traumatized by abandonment, and how she responds to that needs to be her choice. She needs to know that her autonomy will be respected by those who truly love her, she needs to know that they will allow her to make her own decisions about her mother. Whether or not that decision is a mistake & she ends up getting hurt, she will still know that her Aunt & Uncle are a safe space & that they\u2019re people who love her enough to respect her enough to allow her to make her own choices & let her have the autonomy every human being deserves. They won\u2019t be a safe space if they lie to her & attempt to control her by keeping her from making her own decisions about her mother. \n\nAs someone whose mother was strict, controlling, & never respected my autonomy or believed in my ability to make my own decisions and, most importantly, recover from my own mistakes like any human being (even after I turned 18 & moved out), I ended up rebelling pretty hard once I gained my freedom (which is not uncommon \u2014 it\u2019s usually exactly what happens to kids whose parents are very strict & controlling). I also no longer have a relationship with my mother (she is a textbook narcissist & alcoholic who has gotten worse & more aggressive with age \u2014 she recently, while drunk & enraged, physically attacked my aunt/her sister during an argument)\n\nIf she had respected my autonomy & ability to make my own decisions & learn from my own mistakes (rather than never allowing room for even one single tiny mistake), & trying to suffocate me into compliance & obedience without question, I would\u2019ve had room to find my own way without ever feeling the need to explore every dangerous aspect of freedom to assert my autonomy as a separate human being from her (rather than simply being an extension of her, which is how she felt about me). \n\nThis is literally what happens to most kids who grow up in very strict households, who aren\u2019t respected as autonomous human beings of their own & aren\u2019t allowed any freedom to make their own decisions or make any mistakes whatsoever \u2014 which allows them to learn how to pick themselves up & confront those mistakes head-on. They end up rebelling hard & getting hurt, and never trusting their parents enough to feel like they have a safe space to turn to, with people who respect them as autonomous human beings, when they really need it.

Of course, this shouldn't mean that she breaks ties with you \u2013 you're also part of her life and should remain so, but Millie needs to confront her abandonment trauma, and going back with her mother is the best way to do that.

Like a shared custody regime that would eventually lead to her moving in with her mum when the time us right. And it's also extremely important that you don't badmouth her mum in front of her. You might not understand why, but Millie loves her, even if she doesn't dare tell you. She biologically programmed to love her. But she also loves you, and any conflict between her two families will break her.\n\nI really hope you and biomum reach an agreement that benefits Millie before anyone else.

Leave the choice to your daughter, but reassure her that you\u2019re not abandoning her. Laila sure as hell isn\u2019t giving her that respect. The fact that Laila even accused you of \u201cstealing \u201cher\u201d daughter\u201d due to your infertility is breathtakingly cruel and thoughtless, considering the monster abandoned the girl with you for ELEVEN YEARS.

Because it sounds like you have parental rights, and your sisters parental rights have been terminated. If so, that means she doesn't have the right to take Milly to McDonald's against your will, much less to a foreign country. In fact, if you \"gave\" Milly away,  you might even be in legal trouble for parental abandonment. You are her parent. \nSo as a first step you might want to contact a layer and understand what your rights are, and what Milly's are\n At 14 in some US states kids begin to have the right to express preferences i. Court about whom they live with. \nNow on  to your fears-  you know Milly best. She could romantize life  with her bio mom. Or she could be terrified by the prospect of being ripped away fro.her parents (you) and expected to live with a strange family in a strange country. \nShe might not even really remember her mom. She might be ticked off that her mom took care of new children while never even calling her. She may think \"wow!

I remembered wrong. Don't let her take me don't let her take me!\"\n\nThe point is, you don't know how Milly will react. She's a teen. \n\nBut you should never, ever, seem to even entertain for a single second the idea that \"giving Milly back\" is  possible. You are her rock in all the weirdness that is about to unfold for her. You are her Parents. Be her parents. Be the Beacon of calm and sanity. She will need you to be that.\n\nCan she visit with her bio-mom? Sure, if you want, supervised. But don't just roll over and become a doormat, or give in to fear. And above all, don't let your sister just take her away. A woman capable of  electing her child for years does not suddenly become super mom. \n\nMilly might feel guilty about choosing you. When our daughter chose us, she also started acting out and insulting me a lot,  while being on her best behavior and sort of fawning over some bio family that reappeared. She later told me she did that because she felt guilty about choosing us, didn't feel safe expressing her anger towards her sometimes dangerous biomom, so expressed it towards \"safe, loving\" me instead. At night she had repeated nightmares about her biological mom \"stealing her\" and would wake up screaming.\n\nKids do weird stuff. Milly might not express herself clearly, or might seem excited about her mom, or might blow hot and cold. Just stay the course and stay steady in your love.\n\nOur daughter is an adult now, and we are still anatring happy family. \n\nOh, whatever you do, dont talk smack about bio-mom.

Explain all of her options (seeing her bio mom, refusing to see her, ask if she can think of other options) and then discuss pros and cons and possible consequences of each. Discuss what conversations she may expect to have with her bio mom (such as she wants to take you with her) and some healthy ways that your daughter can comment and respond when those conversations come up (maybe that\u2019s as easy as saying \u201cI need to think about this later\u201d). Your daughter will probably want to have a relationship with her half bio siblings as well, which should be encouraged - based upon what I always witnessed, kids do want to know those people that they are related to.\n\nNo matter what she decides, be supportive. Your sister cannot legally come and take her, she doesn\u2019t have legal rights any more. You both would have to go to court again and have it legally done. That\u2019s a conversation to have with your daughter and your sister (separately).\n\nYour sister said what she did to get you to capitulate. One of the best things I learned during my decade of the work I did, related to when kids in our care were misbehaving and maybe not being nice. It is:  all bad behavior is an attempt to have a need met. It\u2019s not about you. She has a need and is behaving badly by talking about your infertility to have her need met. Her need can be met in other , more healthy ways, and you can tell her that it\u2019s probably not your responsibility to meet this need.\n\nKeep in mind, especially for teenagers, having even more people who love them is always a good thing - as long as you control any situations that are too adult for them to navigate. You can all turn this into something great which doesn\u2019t require your daughter going to her bio mom. \n\nAlso, don\u2019t forget family counseling if things get too sticky, and separate counseling for your daughter if needed.

I can't really imagine Milly at this point would want to be force to move in with a woman who is basically a stranger to her at this point. Not to mention a whole family that are strangers to her.\n\nMy suggestion would be to talk to a lawyer that specializes in custody cases. And to also speak to a therapist/counselor about the best way to tell Milly about what's going on. I would think she'd want to stay with you. And considering she's been with you almost 3x as long as she was with her mother and that she's 4 years away from being an adult, that if this went to court, her wishes would weigh heavily in any decision.\n\nPlus if she really does want to stay with you, maybe just telling her dead-beat mother that would be enough to make her go away.", "No, don't ask her that question, she could perceive it  as you're no longer interested in being her parent.

Her bio mom is in for a rude awaking is my guess.", "NTA. \n\nBut how does Milly feel about this?\n\nMake no mistake, what her bio mom did was horrible. She didn't treat Milly like a daughter and doesn't deserve to have her back, you can't just abandon someone and then years later expect you can just have them back.\n\nBut Milly is the one most hurt by this.

I mean honestly no court would ever take her based on the mother abandoning her at a most pivotal time of growth. She also is of age in most states to decide what is best for her and if anything is pursued make sure she has a law guardian in place. Wish you all the best and I honestly would not worry too much, any judge in their right mind would never give someone who not only abandoned their only child but move countries and start new. I would find out the true motive behind this action. Is someone in need of medical that she could provide, do they need a live in nanny?

And she also knows that her mother abandoned her for 11 years. However, keeping it a secret, or keeping them forcefully separate, could breed resentment on your daughters part towards you. Don\u2019t turn your sister into a martyr. That is not a position she deserves. That said, I would highly encourage that she not be allowed to simply go live with her bio mom. I think a therapist is very much needed to facilitate any kind of reconciliation. Your daughter is 14, which means that she\u2019s already in a volatile time in her life what, with being a teenager and all that.
