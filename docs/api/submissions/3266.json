Milly's father died before she was born. Laila had promised to send money for me to take care of Milly and that'd she'd call and visit as often as she could until she could take Milly to live with her permanently.\n\nAfter she left, she called probably 3 times in the first two months and then went awol. For years I'd tried to find out what happened and assumed the worst, only to hear from one of her friends a couple of years later that she got married to someone else and has an entire new family. I was heartbroken because Milly would ask when her mom was coming back and I never knew what to say except \"soon\". But even she grew tired of it and realized when she was about 8 that her mom wasn't coming back anytime soon, that's if she was coming back at all. Because of this situation, me and my wife were granted parental rights to Milly and she couldn't have been happier that we were officially her parents. \n\nWell, what do you know, after 11 years, Laila finally graced us with her long overdue return last week, along with her new very wealthy family and 2 children. Most of the family was happy with her return but me, my mom, dad, and my wife were nothing short of furious. She tried to explain but all that we heard was \" I abandoned my own daughter and made a new family\". \n\nAs if that wasn't enough, she practically demanded her daughter back. Mom and dad weren't having it at all and told her Milly belongs to me and my wife and that she no longer has any right to her. Welp, there she goes screaming at me about stealing her daughter because I was infertile and to hear that come out from her mouth hurt me in a way I've never been hurt before to the point where I cried and left. Me being infertile has always been my weak point and for her to casually bring it up like that despite being my sister broke me. For the next days, I prevented her from contacting Milly and I haven't told her that Laila is back because I'm scared I'll lose my daughter. I'm a human being too, I get attached, especially to someone I've had to raise, that too out of my own pocket, not that I'm complaining. I believe Milly is my daughter and I can't let her go back to the very same woman who abandoned her.\n\nDoes this make me TA?", "created_utc": 1669464048, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z55x30/aita_for_refusing_to_give_my_daughter_back_to_her/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Milly is your daughter, no matter what this horrible woman may say/think/do. \n\nHappily you made this clear: \"me and my wife were granted parental rights to Milly and she couldn't have been happier that we were officially her parents.\" \n\nYou don't have any legal obligation to consider Bio Moms demands. Milly is 14 and has probably 99.9% of her memory filled with life with you and your wife, but 14 is also hard. The brain of a 14 year old is full of ecto-plasmic goo - the very height of poor decision making skills, wanting to be in control of their own destiny, and at prime time to start rejecting parents (which, to be clear, is you - not Bio-Mom).\n\nI think telling Milly some hard truths is the right tack here. Explain the dynamics that 1) she is your daughter and always will be. 2) Bio-Mom is back. 3) She can have as much of a relationship with Bio-Mom as she wants, but that she's always your child and cannot live with Bio Mom, cannot defer to Bio Mom in any parental capacity, and that Bio Mom has some skeletons in the closet and is NOT a trusted adult. \n\nDon't point out that Milly is said skeleton in the closet, but that you know first hand that Bio Mom made some incredibly bad life choices that shows that she isn't someone that can be trusted with children and Milly's safety comes first - physical, emotional all of it.", "NTA. You are Milly's mother now, legally and emotionally. She is not an object to be passed around because suddenly this other person finds it convenient. However, you need to be completely honest with Milly about all of this - she WILL find out one way or another, and keeping this from her will only damage your credibility with her.  Be accurate and truthful about what her bio-mother has done, but do it without badmouthing her as much as possible. Often children put their bio-parents on a pedestal and will hold it against you if you talk disparagingly about them. Consider getting some family counseling so that Milly can work through some of these issues with a 'neutral' third party that will guide her through this emotional baggage.", "NTA. You should not hide this from Milly. She will find out one day and resent you for it.", "NTA. Your sister sounds like a piece of work. But look, you need to let Milly know she's here. You can't keep that from her. And she won't thank you for it if you do. Yes, she may want to go with bio mom, just let her know that you will always love her and be there for her.", "NTA. She did nothing to raise her for past 11 years and your parental rights are legal. With that said, Milly is about 14 now? So perhaps the better way is to ask for her opinion and who would she prefer to stay with.", "NTA- but there is a caveat for staying that way.\n\nIf I were in Milly's shoes I would choose you over Laila any day, and the reason is because you have stayed by her side, but it would be harder to make that choice if you keep hiding the truth from her. She's also old enough that she could be in the stage of if she wants to do something and you don't let her, she will probably do it behind your back.\n\nSit down with Milly and talk to her, ascertain what she thinks of the matter and you would have won against Laila easily. 14 is old enough to have opinions about things that affect her even if she doesn't always make the best choices due to a lack of life experience.", "My heart goes out to you and your daughter and family.

I understand you want to protect both your daughter and your own feelings from any possible conflict or upset, but Milly will find out eventually, and if it doesn\u2019t come from you, it could possibly hurt your relationship more than bio-mum\u2019s return. Sit down and have a conversation with Milly, let her know that bio-mum has returned, but let her know that you\u2019re still her parent, you\u2019ll always be here for her no matter what, that you raised her and no matter what blood relation you are, you love and adore and respect her like a daughter. Let her make up her own mind about if she wants a relationship with bio-mum, but make it perfectly clear that you have parental rights because Bio Mum made some pretty piss poor life decisions (maybe word it a bit better \ud83d\ude02) and that you only have Milly\u2019s best interest at heart.\n\nJust support your daughter however she wants to proceed, she will find out eventually what her bio mum is like, probably when she meets bio mum\u2019s new family and realises that she straight up abandoned Milly in favour of a new family.\n\n\nI wish you and Milly all the best, and i hope everything goes smoothly\n\nEDIT: added \u201cbio\u201d in front of mum", "Does - does your sister seem to think Milly is her childhood bike, or an old toy!??\n\nNO. Just NO\n\nYou took a child her mom left behind and she\u2019s now no longer your niece.

I trust your daughter - not your niece, your daughter - to make the right choice. How could she not? Look who she has for a father!!!\n\nNTA OP. Tell your sister to shove off and fvck off. She\u2019s not Milly\u2019s parent. You and your wife are.", "ESH\n\nYou need to get a lawyer and CYA now. Legally, if you didn\u2019t adopt her, then the mother has the right to take Millie. This poor girl is stuck in a bad spot.\n\nI\u2019d honestly choose the family who brought me in and loved me for 11 years because the mom already made her choice to get with some rich guy and ignore he for most of her life but she is 14 now and should have a say.", "NTA but Milly is 14 and has the right to know the situation since the situation involves her. I get wanting to protect her from this but there is no way to hold it off without inevitably hurting her in the process.", "NTA\n\nLaila had no right to ask for Milly to come and demand Milly to live with her especially years without  contact. She essentially abandoned Milly to start a new family.", "NTA. Laila clearly is. And this is the problem, because she will continue to be one, and fight for what she wants using AH tactics. And she is wealthy so she has that tool to use as well. \n\nYou need to talk to Milly now and explain what is happening. Because if you don't Laila will show up at school, your house, or driving down the street and ambush Milly. She can tell Milly that you are the bad person, that she sent letters and gifts regularly and you kept them from her. She can make up any story she wants and hope that something gains traction. She might even decide to take her and go back to where she came from. After all, she is Milly's \"real\" parent, not you who loved and cared for her for over a decade. Hopefully, all of your legal ducks are in a row. I would contact a lawyer now and discuss the matter with them and see what can be done to head off any legal challenge. But unless Laila surrendered her parental rights, my guess is that she has a legal right to re-insert herself into Milly's life. Hopefully Laila's new life will beckon her again and you wont see her for another 11 years. Good luck to you all, especially Milly.", "INFO: How did you register her for school if you don't have papers granting custody?", "ESH (except Milly) \n\nLaila for abandoning her.
