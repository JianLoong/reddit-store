You should have talked to your son about it first instead of going directly to the boyfriend, but you weren't being malicious so I can call you an A H here.  Your son also should have told you that his boyfriend was having issues at home instead of just assuming you'd be okay with him staying at your house until late hours.  Everyone was trying to do what they thought was the right thing but no one was talking to each other.  Your family needs to work on communication skills.\n\nTalk to your son and see if he thinks you should apologize and reassure his boyfriend that he's welcome, or if he'd rather you leave it alone.  Also, if late hours make you uncomfortable...you're the parent and it's up to you to give your 15yr old a curfew for when friends (and romantic partners) have to leave.  Just make sure the rules are clear.", "Info: did you have any discussion with Tyler about him being bothered by Marius\u2019 visits, or was it purely an assumption?", "NAH, but it sounds like some of this might have been prevented if you had talked to Tyler first.  He may have shared what was going on at Marius's house, he may not have. He may have shared that he was feeling a little smothered, but didn't want to insult Marius. Perhaps you could have helped him figure out how to be sympathetic to Marius's needs while maintaining his own boundaries.", "NAH. Having someone over repeatedly is bound to be annoying and you didn\u2019t know Marius was having trouble at home. Your kid and Marius is 16, they should be cognizant enough to realize this. \n\nYour son should also talk to you about having his partner spend so much time in your house.", "I'ma edge more towards a soft YTA. \n\n\nDon't shoot first and ask questions later. The first thing you should've done was ask Tyler if he's comfortable with Marius being around so often and/or why Marius is around so much. Instead you kinda told Marius not to be around so often instead of trying to figure out why he was around so often in the first place.", "Communication is the key to avoid this kind of incident.", "NTA\n\nIt's your house. If you don't want someone being there night and day, then you are well within your right to say so. His boyfriend shouldn't be there all day every day, even if there was nothing happening at home.\n\nIt's not like you knew he was having problems with his dad. Trying to ask before saying something was your extended olive branch. You can't know something is wrong if he refuses to tell you.\n\nAt most, I think you should have talked to your son before mentioning anything.", "Nta\n\nThis isn't even anything about his dad. If it were a girlfriend, or even a straight male best friend, you'd be in your rights to say the same thing. I see alot of comments saying you should have talked with your son first, and no, you didn't need to do that. If any friend is over too much, you were right to set boundaries. \n\n\nHowever now that you know somethings up with the dad, you can operate differently based on that. Have an open talk one on one with your son about where his comfort level is and assure him that his bf is safe and you're not getting anyone in trouble. It's important he takes this learning lesson on how to be honest with his feelings and is able to see/admit if he needs some space from his bf. You can then go from there and talk to his bf one on one and explain that you can be trusted and he can confide in you. \n\n\nAs long as his bfs life is not in danger and he isn't being abused, you still have to prioritize building a stable home life for your son, even if it means he has ro spend more time at home while his dad figures himself out. \n\nI came out to my parents at 15. If that needs to be said.", "NTA, it is your house and your question was reasonable.  Marius is not your child and you are not a mind reader.", "Nta you asked what was going on and didn't get a response. I don't understand the logic of staying at your house most of the time but not trusting you enough to say why? you clearly have no problem with  their sexuality.", "NTA. Your son is uncomfortable with it, and although it's sad what the boyfriend is going through, your son is your first priority. Setting that boundary is needed for your son to have his own space in his own home.", "NTA. I was 15 once and my mom talked to me all the time. If I had a friend that just kept popping up at her house she would say something. And I would of already told her how I was feeling about them.", "I'm going with NAH.  It might have been helpful to talk to your son first.  I'd say that Tyler should have let you know, but I have a 15 year old in my house and they don't always think things through.  You were trying to make a better situation for Tyler and yourself. \n\nNext step is to apologize to Marius, even though you really did nothing wrong.  He's going through a super hard time right now, and really needs to have a safe place to be.  You need to just deal with this situation, whether it's hard on you or not, until things settle down for Marius.  Make sure Marius knows that his being gay makes no difference to you, and if you knew he was in need of a safe place you would not have asked him to stay away.  This child needs you.  Really, really needs you.  I hope you are able to set aside your discomfort and help him.", "YTA wouldn't step one to be to talk to your son?", "NAH It's your house, too, and him being there all the time was odd. Tyler should have confided in you. I'm hoping you can all work something out.", "Soft YTA. You obviously did not know what Marius was dealing with at home - but you should be aware of the difficulties people from the LGBTQ+ community face with unsupportive families. (I guessed it was something along those lines by the end of your first paragraph).  However, I think the real issue is involving yourself in your child's relationship.  If he is old/mature enough to date someone, he should also be able to set boundaries and be able to communicate them on his own.", "YTA\n\n*I can also tell it was starting to bother Tyler and he looks like he might want a little distance*\n\nI hate to break it to you but you can't read your childs' mind.  And even if you could it would be HIS responsibility to use his grown up words and talk to his BF.  Not you.  Not today, not tomorrow, not ever.\n\nOf course, you can set rules about how much guests are over but that is handled with your child.  No one else.", "NTA - You were just trying to be a protective parent and could see this was bothering your son.", "I admit that having him wait outside while we were out would totally freak me out, as my stalker in high school would do this. However, I'd have talked to your son first.  That is where you went wrong.  But I would make it a rule saying people can't wait at the house while the family was not home. I'm going with NAH.", "Nta. Your house, your freaking rules. The kids come around too much. Where's the privacy ?", "Soft YTA. You should've talked to your son first.", "Soft YTA. I'm LGBTQ and my immediate thought was \"he has a bad situation at home and is avoiding it\". He's at your house all the time because he feels comfortable there. He feels more comfortable around your family than his own. Is that annoying at times? Yeah, but you're in a position to make one of the hardest times in his life a LOT easier.\n\nYou don't have a time machine, but a way better way of approaching it would have been to ask him \"Hey, I've noticed that you've been around a lot more than normal? Is there a particular reason why?\" Or, even better would be to approach your son and point out that you noticed he seemed a little stressed with his boyfriend being around so often. He either would have told you what was going on, or you could have turned it into a lesson on how to navigate relationships in a healthy manner.\n\nIf I were you, I'd talk to your son and then talk to Marius and tell him you didn't know he had just come out and, if you're comfortable with it, let him know that you're there for him and if things are bad at home, make it clear you're there to support him and he can crash on the couch if he needs to. If he's anything like me I was TERRIFIED at that point in my life. Knowing I had somewhere safe outside of my own home would have been a godsend for me.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn\u2019t know the situation and the kid was mooching off your home.", "NTA.\n\nYes, you probably should have talked to your son first and helped him learn to set a boundary, but you and your son are not obligated to have him at your house all the time just because his home life is hard right now.  You can still be a safe place, with certain constraints on when or for how long he can be at your house.\n\nIf he is at risk of being abused or is kicked out and homeless, you can have the discussion of finding additional resources for him or providing that.  Don't teach your son to take on the entire burden of their significant others issues.  Teach him to support but still respect his own feelings. \n\nI am not lgbtq but when I was a teenager I dated a guy who had a really bad home life.  He was at my house constantly, and the relationship lasted much too long because I felt guilty for taking away his \"safe space/person\".  Our relationship was a bandaid for his issues.  Anyways, I know none of you have bad intentions but giving the kid free range because of bad circumstances is setting you all up for failure.", "YTA, you didn't ask Tyler if he had a problem you assumed it before jumping into his relationship. Then you could also have recognised hey, something happened with Marius and he's around all the time. Your first thought should also have been ask him what is going on and if he's okay because something changed.\n\nMarius needed a shoulder and some understanding and instead you made him feel shitty for being around so much because he was avoiding hate from his dad.\n\nYou would lose nothing asking Tyler first or asking Marius if everything was okay before you told Marius you wanted him around less... which incidentally is probably what his own father told him.", "NTA\n\nI get that you maybe overstepped a tad, but you had the right to. Your son is still a minor in your care. You correctly deduced that your son was growing uncomfortable with his BF being in your home all the time. And you weren't rude or unkind. You have a right to have family time, or to be consulted about a guest being so continuously in your home. And it is your job to protect your son in all situations. How were you to know that his BF was trying to escape a bad situation rather than being controlling and possessive?\n\nLet your son calm down a little and then talk to him again. His BF can't spend every second in your home, it's not healthy for anyone, but perhaps there are things you can help them both with. His BF is still welcome, and if either of them need help, you are there to provide what help you can, but there are still boundaries and levels of respect that have to be adhered to. Your son's independence and mental health can't be sacrificed for his BF, as cruel as that may seem. And your family home can't be treated like an escape hatch for a traumatised teen without your knowledge and consent. There's a happy medium, but your son and your family are the priorities for you.", "Soft YTA - While well intentioned, you should\u2019ve made a chat with your son before talking to Marius. You made some assumptions that he was uncomfortable and wanted Marius around less, but rather than talking to him and getting the full story, you sprung into action. A quick chat before the conversation could\u2019ve avoided a lot of unnecessary drama.", "Surprised by all these \"why don't you get your son's approval\"-takes. Why? This is their home, and they can set reasonable visitation hours for their child's boyfriend. And so long as the request is reasonable, they don't even need a justification. If I'm the father of the house, and I don't want someone that's not family being there every moment while I'm home, then that's really the final word on it.\n\nIts unfortunate that Marius's home life isn't great, and it perhaps would have been more diplomatic to have the message come from Tyler, but it's not Tyler's decision, and it also wouldn't necessarily be fair to Tyler to force him to pass along the message and create friction.", "Yeah, you stuck your foot in it. You should have spoken to your son, first. YTA. Apologise and make it up to Marius.", "NTA. I feel for the kid, but your son is uncomfortable and so are you.

You can still say that he can't spend all his time there but he is still welcome in your home.", "NAH.", "YTA. You took it upon yourself to confront him before you even discussed this with your son. Have Tyler invite Marius back over, apologize for what you said, and then let him know that you support him and want him to be safe. That doesn't mean letting him move in (unless that's something you're open to), but at least let him know you'll do what you can to protect him even if it means he's at your house a lot.", "YTA. Why wouldn't you bring your concerns to your son first? If your concern was really that it was bothering Tyler, you should have confirmed that with Tyler. \n\nA vulnerable child was seeking solace in your home and instead of greeting him with open arms or just open doors you let him know this is yet another home he is not welcome in. Tyler has every right to be upset.", "INFO why didn\u2019t you talk with your son before talking to Marius??", "NAH but I\u2019m not gonna lie, I immediately guessed that there must have been something going on at home. You didn\u2019t know, so you\u2019re not an asshole, but personally my first response would be to ask if there\u2019s something going on at home.", "I saw the \"he came out to his dad and they didn't like it\" coming a mile away.\n\nIt sounds like you're remorseful so I won't go for a massive YTA, but next steps matter- talk to Tyler about how to make it up to Marius.", "NAH. It's your house and you have the right to set some boundaries. You didn't know what was happening.", "Soft YTA- it's okay to want to limit the time any guest is in your home. That said, you made assumptions about how your son felt, and instead of talking to him about it, you immediately went to his boyfriend. \n\nNext time it would probably be a good idea to talk to your son about it first and see if you can come up with a solution together.", "YTA a child that is literally avoiding home at all costs should\u2019ve been a flag to you that their home life is messy.

He just kinda shrugged and. wouldn't say much.\n\nIf the kid was making a cry for help and wanted to reach out to someone to ask for some support in a tough home life, he needs to use his words here and not just shrug his shoulders and act like you should just know what he might be going through.", "YTA. Even ignoring that it should have been obvious that a kid spending all his time away from home has a reason, you had no business telling the kid to come around less. There is no way that is going to go over well even if your son really wants distance as you assumed he did. If your son wants some space, he needs to say so. If you need the kid to stick to normal hours, have your son tell him.  \n\n\nAlso perdition? Rough around the edges? Business Hours? I'm tempted to assume a racial component but I will ignore that and just say that parents interfering in the relationships of their children, regardless of age usually get burned.", "NTA or NAH, although it would have been good to talk to Tyler first before saying something.  Communication could have been better on all sides.  This made me think of when I was in high school and a guy that had a crush on me was constantly showing up to my house when I wasn't there- I would get home and find him sitting in the living room and hanging out with my parents.  It was creepy and annoying and made me extremely uncomfortable.  Setting boundaries is healthy.", "NTA\n\nIt seems like you made sensitive approach by asking Marius why he is at your house more frequent. I do understand that his situation is difficult, but by just shrugging it off and not talking to you he isn't helping himself much. At the end he hanging around your house all the time, so it's affecting you. And if you don't like guests over all the time, it is okay for you to feel this way. Not everyone likes this.\n\nMaybe sit down with Marius and talk to him, if there's a way you can help and support him with his problems with his father.

This kid is at your house when Tyler is gone and lingers all the time. It sounds like your house is probably safer and more comfortable.

If Tyler is old enough to date, he is old enough to be given the opportunity to put down boundaries with his date. \n\nYou should have talked to your son first.

It's his relationship. Even if you were correct that Tyler was sort of uncomfortable, your son is old enough to be dating so he's too old for you to assume you know what he's feeling.

That's out of your control and unless you plan on adopting this kid, he isn't living full-time with you.", "Mild YTA. \n\nYou really should have spoken to Tyler first before approaching Marius. First, while you say you saw Tyler acting uncomfortable, you didn\u2019t know if it was 100% due to Marius, or another issue. Second, a kid suddenly hanging around a lot more often, and delaying going home, usually means there is a reason they don\u2019t want to go home. My best friend in high school often slept over my house for weeks at a time. My mom never said a thing about it. When I asked her why she never spoke to me about it, she just said it was obvious my friend was having a rough time at home, and wanted her to feel she had somewhere to go. My friend told me years later her dad was schizophrenic and refused to take meds, and there were times he refused to believe she was his daughter, and she was forever grateful to my mom for allowing her to stay. Finally, Tyler should have been consulted before you stepped in on his behalf. It seems like he was pretty straightforward with you, and I\u2019m sure he would have at least given you half of the picture if you\u2019d spoken with him. \n\nAll that to say, you\u2019re a parent who was looking out for their kid and went about it in not the best way. You are human, and it happens. I don\u2019t think you are cruel or mean, but you could have done it in a way that didn\u2019t didn\u2019t leave a rejected kid reeling more rejected.

When a child seems to want to hang out at your home even when his reason for being at that home isn't around, it should have turned on some alarm bells for you to maybe take a beat and have an actual conversation with Marius instead making it about how he's hanging around too much for your liking.  Cause otherwise he would have been waiting for Tyler at school or his after school curriculars or hanging out wherever Tyler is instead of just patiently waiting at your house.  He could patiently wait at his own house, but since he's not it's a pretty good indicator that something is keeping that from being a welcome place for him and he thought he was accepted at your home.\n\nYou also go into YTA territory for the fact that you decided you're clairvoyant and could just tell that Tyler didn't like it and took it upon yourself to talk to Marius on his behalf instead of actually checking with your son first.

Tyler may be in mind, but Tyler definitely wasn't part of the conversation. If I can sense that my child is having difficulties in their relationship for any given reason, the first person I'd want to speak to first before doing anything would be *my child*. Just because Tyler's feelings are in mind doesn't mean Tyler is actually included in the conversation. \n\n> op gave him the opportunity to say if there was a reason he was avoiding home, and when he did not give one, op very gently told marius he was pushing the boundaries of the home by always being over.\n\nIn all honesty, we only have OP's word on that:\n\n> Well I tried to explain the best I could that we love having him around ,but that maybe it'd be best if he went back to regular business hours or that maybe Tyler could go over his place sometimes.\n\nThis conversation honestly could've happened any number of ways. Whether or not OP was gentle is an unknown. Plus, I mean, if my partner's mom asked about my troubled home-life, I wouldn't feel comfortable answering any questions about that. OP says she didn't know that Marius had a bad home life, but that easily could've been found out by talking to Tyler. \n\n> Its not just about tyler, its about the (probably like) three other people living in the house who might not want a boyfriend over constantly.\n\nThat we also don't know. We don't know if OP is married and how their spouse feels about it, and given that Tyler is described as the \"youngest\", it's very possible it might just be her and OP if OP isn't married.\n\nI don't fault OP for having her kid's interests at heart in all of this; I genuinely don't. I'd say OOP is YTA in the situation, but not that OP is a bad person. I think OP's main misstep here was not including Tyler, the main person affected by all this, in the conversation and not talking to him first before doing anything else. That's ultimately my main gripe with all of this is that she should've talked to her son first and foremost before taking action over something as minimal and banal as the boyfriend being over more than she'd like.

Everything okay?\".", "Teenage boys will often say that they are okay or things are okay when you first ask them, but you can tell from the way that they say it, that they aren't.

It's not just about the thought behind it, it's the action that's followed through that matters too. That's why I'm going with a soft YTA for OP. OP isn't a bad person, but they definitely should've handled things differently, which makes them the asshole in this situation because they basically told their kid's boyfriend not to be around without telling their kid they told the boyfriend that. Tyler's thoughts and feelings matter too, and those should've been discussed *with Tyler*.", "> She didn't know he wasn't welcome at home at the time,\n\nThen she probably should've talked to her son first.
