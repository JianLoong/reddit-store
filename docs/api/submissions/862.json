It sounds like things have been fairly shit for a while. \n\nHonestly this should just end and both go your separate ways.

If you can't afford for someone to come in one day a week, nor can either of you make yourself put in the effort then it is what it is. You can go back and forth until you are both blue in the face, but if neither of you clean, you're living in a dirty house. Either institute rules that you both follow without monitoring the others behavior or accept that y'all will be arguing about it forever. (I'm not necessarily trying to be harsh. It just seems like this is passive pettiness between the two of you because neither of you want to do it.)", "NTA", "NTA Sounds like you spoiled her.", "We have last year on my instigation but it died a quick and silent death.

It fills my heart when she goes out of her way to help me, but it fills mine just as much when I get the chance to do the same.", "Totally agreed on each aiming for 51%.  Iffy about the equality being for business only piece haha\n\nThe way I'm looking at it isn't so much that equality means each person precisely contributes 50% (and no more), BUT similarly to your point, that there's an equal degree of effort, consideration and regard from both parties.  In this way, I do think that equality is important in romantic relationships.  \n\nTL;DR we agree lol"]}
