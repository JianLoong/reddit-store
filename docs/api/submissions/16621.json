They haven't met my wife in person or seen my apartment, so they stopped by. When we found out they were coming, we did a sweep of the house to put anything we wouldn't want my nephew being exposed to. \nExcept the bedroom, because we didn't expect anyone to go in there. Even then, the only thing out in the open was a weed grinder with some grinded up weed in it. It's designed to look like a dragon ball. It's an orange sphere with the stars on it.\n\nI have a gaming PC that I keep in the bedroom. Somehow the topic got to video games with my nephew and I absent mindedly let him in there to play some games for a bit.\n\nI let him play a game for a bit and we were having a good time. Eventually we traded seats so I could pull up a different game for him, and he started looking around my room, immediately noticing the dragon ball grinder. As soon as he mentioned it, I tried to play it off and tell him it was a collectable so he shouldn't mess with it. It was too late, he was all over it and quickly realized it opened up to reveal my grinded up weed. \n\nHe asked me if it was weed, so I told him it was, and decided he was mature enough to understand. I explained that as an adult, I'm able to partake in stuff like that responsibly and in moderation, but that it's unhealthy for someone his age, etc. I compared it to alcohol. I thought we had a good talk as he understood my point and dropped it. We played more games until they had to go. \n\nWell, as soon as they left, he told my half sister all about it, who promptly called me and told me how much a piece of shit druggie I was for exposing her child to my filthy habits. I tried to explain my mistake and she just wasn't having it. However, importantly, she was more angry that I \"tried to teach him about drugs\" by not lying about what it was. She then told some of our other family, who were less upset but still took her side in the sense that I should be way more responsible than that, and one person brought up that it wasn't my place to explain weed to him.\n\nI can kinda see their point, but he already knew what it was, and I didn't think lying to him would help my case.\nI might be the asshole because I should've thought about my grinder being out before I allowed him into the room, and because she is his parent and it's up to her to tackle these issues with him in her own way.", "created_utc": 1683466016, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13anoul/aita_for_leaving_my_weed_out_for_my_nephew_to/", "score": 2247, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He shared your conversation with his mother, (good that he talks to her about things), who then flew off the rails. \n\nNTA and your sister needs to get a grip, her boy *will* be exposed to things, whether she likes it or not.

His mother is sheltering him by getting this irate that someone had a conversation with him about what weed is.. it\u2019s weed for god sake it\u2019s not like you left out your stash of heroine", "NTA. Your half sister overreacted. The comment calling you an AH sounds like an uneducated and unhinged person. Marijuana is nothing like penicillin\u2026 penicillin is actually really dangerous. Marijuana isn\u2019t nearly as dangerous and it isn\u2019t like the kid could have ate the grinded weed and had any reaction at all. If you had gummies or chocolate out and he was unattended then sure, that\u2019d be terrible\u2026. But grinded up weed is not dangerous without a flame or a way to decarb it, and the kid wasn\u2019t unsupervised.", "NTA\n\nAs a child, a lot was hidden for me information-wise or just straight up off limits to even talk about. Short version: it went super wrong and I definitely have trust issues.\n\nYou did your nephew a favour by telling him the truth. It's not like you actually drugged him or something...", "Nta. You told him to leave it alone and he didn't listen. It's not like you left a bong on the kitchen counter.", "NTA your sister is too uptight. Hiding stuff from kids only makes them know you are lying and they then mistrust you and it builds walls. Her kid now knows not to talk to his mom about drugs because she can't have a calm discussion about it. \nTell her the truth, he knew exactly what it was so you didn't introduce anything to him, he already had been exposed and learned from someone else, you didn't lie to him, and you aren't lying to her either.", "NAH. I think your sister could have easily guessed that something like this might happen, unless she has no clue about what your life is like. I think your explanation to your nephew was good and makes sense--the legal and social position of weed is shifting, so it is more like alcohol. People drink in front of kids all the time, and if you'd had a six pack in your fridge for your nephew to discover, no one could have reasonably been shocked or upset.   \n\n\nAt the same time, since the way people think about weed is going through a change, I think it's not surprising that some people are ahead of the curve and fully accepting of it, and others are kind of behind the times, like your sister. She shouldn't have yelled at you, but if she had a fear of drugs ingrained in her as a young person and feels that it is her maternal duty to protect her child from what she believes is evil, it makes sense. I hope you two can work this out.", "NTA. It was in your room, you don't have kids so your room wasn't staged to be kid friendly, and you had a mature conversation about it. \n\nIt sounds like your sister just really hates weed.", "NTA. Your sis is over reacting and you did the best you could. My partner and I have a kid who doesn\u2019t live with us but visits and we tell her not to snoop, we have all our pieces in our bedroom and everything else is in a drawer. If anything your sis is the ass for not listening to you explain", "NTA. You didn\u2019t leave it like out, it was in your private bedroom, which a kid normally wouldn\u2019t be in. I would see her point if you just like left it on the coffee table but that\u2019s not what happened. And IMO, informing a kid on the dangers of something rather than just saying \u201cweed bad don\u2019t do it\u201d is a lot more successful in the long run, cause kids/teens are always curious creatures", "NTA, it doesn\u2019t sound like you left anything out maliciously.", "NTA\n\nYou handled it responsibly.", "I'm going to say NTA overall, it sounds like you gave him a good talk.\n\nHowever, I will note that you slipped with the idea of how you were going to entertain your nephew. The majority of kids, especially boys, play videogames these days. I personally would consider anywhere a games console as a possible place a child might end up being entertained in.\n\nYour half-sister is probably upset that you touched on a divisive topic with her son without her permission or presence.

And does you sister/nephew live in a place were it is legal? Is full recreational legal or just medical? Or are you like my place of residence were it's recreational mascarading itself as medical?", "Nta, kids aren't stupid. Obviously not a perfectly ideal situation, but you did the best you could have in that moment. Try asking your sister of she genuinely would have preferred for you to lie, or act scared and nervous and cagey making him potentially more interested?\n\nWtf are you supposed to say at that point, \"N-no they're ground up sensu beans!\"", "NTA.\n\n As a very pro-weed person, it's about time we stop with the weed bashing. Hiding it from kids makes no sense when we openly show alcohol infront of them. If they have the capacity to understand alcohol is for adults only and its okay for them to use in moderation then weed absolutely should be given the same grace. \n\nGood on you for being frank and transparent with your nephew. If you take the mystery away now, it will be alot less novel to them later down the line.", "NTA. Tired of the archaic views on Marijuana.

I normally keep my stash very secure and hard for the average visitor to access \nI think it was just an unfortunate accident, everyone has a different opinion about weed and it\u2019s important to remember that some people take \u201cdevils lettuce\u201d very literally and do not condone it. \nYour sister was just mama bear for a moment and I\u2019m hopeful she will be fine. I am more on your side though as you handled it well and turned it into a teaching moment \nBravo \ud83c\udf88", "Nta. It happens and obviously he already knew what weed was so it ended up a conversation that needs to be had. Being too sheltered doesn't lead to a healthy stable person.

I don't trust a single adult who says to lie. They shouldn't have kids.", "NTA. It\u2019s messed up that people wanted you to lie to a kid. It\u2019s not like you left a bong full of dirty water in reach of a toddler and it\u2019s probably better for the kid to learn about weed from the cool uncle than the cool older kids at school.", "NTA.

That's up to his parents. I think you handled it well, though.", "NTA for the interaction.
