Layla is 22 in college and lives in dorms. I married my husband 4 years ago when Layla still lived in the house but soon after she moved out as college started and just came back for visits. Even in summer, she chooses to rent and live alone. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEverything was fine until a month ago I started noticing that the condition I leave the house in before heading to work is not the same condition I find my house in coming back from work. It was very creepy because despite no items were missing the house felt like it was used despite me and my husband being out of it. My husband and I decided to install cameras because we legitimately thought someone was breaking into the house to find out it was Layla entering the house roaming around it and for some reason opening my wardrobe then leaves. My husband talked to his daughter and asked her why exactly she entered the house while we were away and why she never tells us she did and her answer was that this is \"her\" house and she had been in it before me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI told my husband she already moved out and I am paying rent for the house so it is my house and she has no right to enter without permission let alone go through my stuff. We kinda forgot she had keys to our house because during her visits not once did she use them. Anyway, my husband did agree with me and took away her keys telling Layla she is welcome to visit anytime with our permission.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow her aunt has called me telling me I am cruel for turning father against his daughter and that it is \"layla's house\" I should not have a say in who can and can't have keys. Layla didn't visit us since the whole incident nor talked on the phone.
