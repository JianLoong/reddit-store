They could ask, but they should have accepted a \"No\" for an answer, not push their kids or become passive-aggressive.", " NTA also when I\u2019ve been in a gondola it\u2019s a 360 view. Could they not have asked someone else?", "NTA\n\nI have never been in a gondola either. I wouldn't give up my spot that I fairly claimed to anyone else especially not when people make my life hell after I tell them no. Considering you are older than these kids, you could argue you deserve it more if you've never been on a gondola before, because the kids still have a lot more life left than you and plenty more time than you do to go on a gondola again. If they want to have an argument like that...\n\nIt's one thing to ask if a shorter child can stand in front of you at the zoo or whatever, because you'd be able to look over their head so their presence wouldn't interfere with you at all. But it's something else to have to give up your seat which would mean you can't enjoy the view in the same way as when you sit right next to the window.\n\nA middle ground could be that in a next instance like this, you can offer to swap with one of the kids halfway through the ride.", "NTA. They asked. You were within your right to tell them \"no\". Their kids need to learn the great philosopher Jagger's lesson: that they can't always get what they want.", "NTA.  If this was a skiing day and I was going up in the gondola for the 4th time, I might be volunteering my seat for someone who seemed excited for the view.   This was your first trip on a gondola and you were first in line. You have every right to keep the seat you chose. The parents weren\u2019t wrong to ask, but their behavior after you declined moving was inappropriate.", "There is more than one window in a gondola.  Those parents showed their children that you swear at people when you don't get your way. Strongly NTA", "NTA. But this is odd because usually the number of people in there is limited to seats and the whole thing is basically a window so everyone should be seeing pretty much the same thing.", "NTA but imo it would have been the nice thing to do, had they not asked like that.

Also, there isn't just one window in the gondola, why didn't they go to the other windows?", "Love that comment.", "There wasn\u2019t any seats, people just stand in the gondola. There\u2019s a railing around and something to hang that comes from the top. Also some bars in the middle so you can hold while it moves", "Exactly this. Entitled people assuming their offspring deserve more because they are young. When my son was small, if it was important, we got there early to get a good spot.", "Still though, usually the whole thing has a view.", "NTA. It\u2019s rude that they even asked you to move.  Their kids are going to be entitled brats if this is the way they\u2019re parented.", "NTA - entitled parents make entitled children!", "NTA. Welcome to the world in entitled parents. Good for you for standing your ground.", "I had two kids and I never EVER asked someone to move so my kid could get a better spot.  First one onto the gondola gets first choice of seat.  That's it, it's that simple.  NTA.", "NTA but kids are short\u2026? You couldn\u2019t both look out the window? Were you blocking the whole view?", "Info: were you a tall person \"blocking\" the view of a small person? If they had stood in front of you would you have had essentially the same view and they also would have been able to see?", "NTA. You were entitled to stand where you wanted, you got to the window first and they should have accepted your no as final. They are just entitled idiots and you did not need to move.", "NTA they asked and you said no. That should be the end.  Kids aren\u2019t entitled to anything they want and the parents should know this.", "NTA because that's hella entitled to expect someone to move for you or your kids. But I will say, I have been in a similar situation where we were packed in like sardines so if you weren't near the window the view wasn't great. We offered to let some kids in front of us since they were so short it made absolutely no difference to our view or experience. I struggle to see how it wouldn't have been the same for you and sometimes kindness goes a long way.", "Not my kid, not my problem", "Was it illegal what you did? No. Would it have killed you to switch? Also, no. I'm probably biased because I get annoyed by people who have to film everything all the time just to fill their SD cards. I'm pretty sure your relatives or your insta feed could have survived with a 2 minute video of some mountain instead of 10.\nAnd I don't get the appeal of filming through a scratched up plastic gondola window when you can just wait a few minutes, then film from top of the mountain and habe an actually good view. \nThen again, I also don't really understand why they needed exactly your spot. All gondolas I've ever been on usually had windows on all sides. Maybe the door windows are bigger, but there's at least 2 sliding doors on each gondola. Why did they not just ask the people on the other side when you said no.\nEither way, if you live in one of the countries (and regions) I assume you do, then yes, sorry, but people will definitely perceive you as an A H bc kids are just naturally given priority in these situations here. I hope none of your coworkers was on the same gondola with you because they'll definitely talk. Again, not that you did anything inherently wrong. It's just how people outside of Reddit, especially in little mountain towns, will perceive it.", "NTA \n\nNo one needs to give up their space to anyone for any reason.  But geesh it's your first time experiencing something too", "NTA", "NTA. Sometimes other people will be first and get the things we want. It\u2019s something kids have to learn.", "Their children are going to be insufferable entitled people as they get older and the parents continue to coddle them, especailly at the expense of other people's rights.  OMG, I'm so sorry this happened to you.  If I were there I would have told off the parents.", "Just because they are kids doesn\u2019t mean they should get anything they want. Was at a sci nice museum a while back with some friends and was playing with an exhibit. A kid told me to give it to him and I said so, wait your turn. He complained to his parents and I told them he could have it when it was his turn and that it was my turn now. They were fine with that.", "NTA", "NTA. This sounds exactly like when I'd beg my parents to let me stand by the window in the big glass elevator at the mall, only instead of asking everybody else to accommodate me and baby raging when they didn't, we just rode the elevator up, then down, then up again.", "NTA. Anyone that young on a trip like that will get to go again, and you likely won't. Good for you, sticking up for yourself and enjoying your once in a lifetime opportunity.\n\nAnd I think people forget that. Their \"once a year\" trip is another person's dream. They forget that.", "NTA.  Sorry your first gondola ride was so uncomfortable.  \n\nPeople like that are not doing their kids any favors.", "NTA. People these days act super entitled.", "NTA - You were there first. That said, every gondola I have been on has windows on every side. Why did they have to stand specifically where you stood?", "Sounds like there was only one window on the gondola? I don\u2019t understand. Usually they have 360 degree windows.", "NTA typical entitled parents thinking the seas should part for their children. Adults are allowed enjoyment too.", "NTA those parents use their kids to bully you out of your spot. You may have offered the share with the children but not giving up all together \n\nNTA but they are", " That puts the onus on a stranger to do a favor for my kid and that's not fair to the stranger.\n\nNTA. Some people are just entitled af, ignore them.", "Sounds like there was only one window on the gondola?", "The parents weren\u2019t wrong to ask, but their behavior after you declined moving was inappropriate.", "Used to sing that to my kids.", "\"Going to be\"? Too late!\n\nOP, where did this take place? I'm confused by a culture that supposedly expects adults to make way for children.", "See, that\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking.  Unless you are a LP wouldn\u2019t you see right over the heads of two little kids?", "What the hell does this even mean?", "Right?! Gondolas are generally 360 windows and seat a max of 6 people meaning 4 window seats and it sounds like there were 4 people in the gondola. Why didn\u2019t one of the parents give up their spot? OP had no reason to give up their spot just as others were and paid just as others did.", "Don\u2019t you know that the darling little angels must come first?! Who cares that OP was recording, they could have just recorded the scenery over the cherub\u2019s head.   (I\u2019m being facetious, of course. But it truly is ridiculous that so many parents actually think like this)", "Still do. And they hate it. Which makes me love it more.", "I'm sure this is the type of gondola going up grouse mountain in Vancouver (as an example) it holds 100 people. I don't really understand why the kids couldn't stand in front of the OP. But she is still NTA.", "That's a cable car, not a gondola.", "Which is easily interchanged. If it actually was an 8 seat gondola OP wouldn't have to move for children to see. Additionally, you're not allowed to actually stand in gondolas. While you barely have a choice in cable cars. \n\n\nAs a not English first language person everything going up a mountain like that is a gondola, no matter the capacity.\n\nEdit as per op: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/qWaUqtJ02v\n\"There wasn\u2019t any seats, people just stand in the gondola. There\u2019s a railing around and something to hang that comes from the top.

Regardless the response is the same, OP had no obligation to give up their window seat.", "I work on ski lifts. That doesn't sound like any modern passenger gondola, tram, or cable car I'm familiar with. In fact it sounds like a lawsuit waiting to happen. Unlike with a chair lift that is designed to scoop you up in a seated position that is nigh on impossible to fall out of, a gondola or cable car/tram car has no such design and excessive wind or passenger movement could send someone tumbling out of the open car. I've never heard of an open gondola or cable car still in use in any country with ski resorts. There's one that's a historical site at an old mine, but it runs underground down into the mine, not up an active ski resort.", "Incorrect, a tram is on the ground pulled by a cable grabbing mechanism that pulls it along a single rail or cable in a trench in the ground, a cable car is a tram that has the cable riding mechanism on top and it's suspended in the air. I work on ski lifts.", "Cool story bro. She didn't say it was an open car. She said there was a railing and loops from the ceiling. As someone who doesn't work on ski lifts but has actually skied and snowboarded. This is my invitation to visit the skyride on grouse mountain in Canada. Or the Ahornbahn in Mayrhofen Austria. \n\nAlways with the lawsuits!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/GJyLrkeZ3No?si=8sBcOpuR4o1RSV4e\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7SKpV9UzN7E?si=mUvCUOOrYLw1UuOq"]}
