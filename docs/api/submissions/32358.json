If they wanted to be by the window, they could've waited for the next one or gotten in line sooner.\n\nIt's OK of them to ask. That's not the issue. Their response and handling being told \"no\" is what makes them assholes.", "NTA...people are free to ask, but that doesn't make you instantly obligated.", "NTA\n\nThey can always just ride it again.\n\n> When they opened the gates to get inside the gondola, I made sure to get a spot close to the window so I could record everything.\n\nBut *this* time, you were there **first**.", "NTA. They could ask, but they should have accepted a \"No\" for an answer, not push their kids or become passive-aggressive.", " NTA also when I\u2019ve been in a gondola it\u2019s a 360 view. Could they not have asked someone else?", "NTA\n\nI have never been in a gondola either. I wouldn't give up my spot that I fairly claimed to anyone else especially not when people make my life hell after I tell them no. Considering you are older than these kids, you could argue you deserve it more if you've never been on a gondola before, because the kids still have a lot more life left than you and plenty more time than you do to go on a gondola again. If they want to have an argument like that...\n\nIt's one thing to ask if a shorter child can stand in front of you at the zoo or whatever, because you'd be able to look over their head so their presence wouldn't interfere with you at all. But it's something else to have to give up your seat which would mean you can't enjoy the view in the same way as when you sit right next to the window.\n\nA middle ground could be that in a next instance like this, you can offer to swap with one of the kids halfway through the ride.", "NTA. They asked. You were within your right to tell them \"no\". Their kids need to learn the great philosopher Jagger's lesson: that they can't always get what they want.", "NTA.  If this was a skiing day and I was going up in the gondola for the 4th time, I might be volunteering my seat for someone who seemed excited for the view.   This was your first trip on a gondola and you were first in line. You have every right to keep the seat you chose. The parents weren\u2019t wrong to ask, but their behavior after you declined moving was inappropriate.", "There is more than one window in a gondola.  Those parents showed their children that you swear at people when you don't get your way. Strongly NTA", "NTA. But this is odd because usually the number of people in there is limited to seats and the whole thing is basically a window so everyone should be seeing pretty much the same thing.", "NTA but imo it would have been the nice thing to do, had they not asked like that. Them asking like they're entitled to it lost them the moral high ground. You're fine", "YTA. Child, no one gonna give up dey spot for you. You besta learn dat in dis city, we don't do dat kinda thang for kids. Cultures is different and nobody gotta bow down to ya just cuz you cryin'. Suck it up buttercup and quit yer whinin'.
