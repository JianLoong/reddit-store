Or just how white people bought them?", "I think we ALL know they haven't unpacked any white privilege. Look at their replies lol.", "Sorry I'm not going to engage in a discussion with a racist who can't see past their own nose. You're generalizing an entire group of people based only on race in your very first sentence and then saying you can't be racist in the next, totally ignorant.", "You\u2019re only proving my point.\n\nTake your ignorance and racism elsewhere. There is no excuse for you to be this uneducated, it\u2019s frankly offensive.\n\nEnslavement has affected every race. The perpetrators of slavery, past and present, are overwhelmingly African, therefore black.\n\nAs far as being enslaved, every single race has fallen victim to this. \n\nMore black people have been enslaved historically, but this enslaved was perpetrated predominately by other black people. \n\nThe Transatlantic slave trade is merely a drop in the bucket when it comes to Africa\u2019s history of enslavement. Black leaders willingly sold their own people into slavery, they profited from the slave trade.", "They both fall under the umbrella of \u201cwhite\u201d. The other user ignorantly claimed that you \u201ccan\u2019t be racist towards white people\u201d. \n\nThe Irish and Italians are just two examples that debunk that absurd claim.\n\nWhen you try to compound entirely separate ethnic groups on the basis of how much melanin they have, you erase the clear distinctions between these groups and the unique historical experiences they endured.", "Because sexual molestation, which already most 8 year olds SHOULD understand happens so they know what behaviors are inappropriate, was not public information and also contains sexual information. Although most kids already know the dirty priest jokes anyway. Not even remotely related to racism, which is EVERYWHERE, and a false equivalency. It also brings in the sensitivity of religion which is more opinion/belief based, whereas the existence of Malcolm X and why he changed his last name is just facts.", "Hey!
