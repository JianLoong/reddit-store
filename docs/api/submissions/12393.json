Maybe because I'm old, but I don't understand this idea that the bride has to be the central figure of the entire day, and that no one can take their eyes off her or speak of anything but her. I always saw the wedding as a family celebration. The more to celebrate, the better. I find the whole thing weird.", "NTA! There is literally no difference between you having a boyfriend or a girlfriend and you were just being honest about who you are. Your aunt is a little bit an AH for making a big deal out of it at the wedding instead of thinking about how your cousin would feel. Ultimately it was just unfortunate circumstances and it sucks that your cousin felt that way but you did absolutely nothing wrong but be honest about who you are.\n\nTo those saying YTA, would you propose that OP lie about herself on the chance that someone might be interested in her more than a passing congratulatory statement? That's ridiculous.", "NTA \nYou answered a question that is pretty common at any family heavy event in a casual and pretty low key way just like you would have if you were straight. \nThat your aunt chose to gossip about it then as opposed to later is your aunt's problem and nothing you instigated. \n I see some people saying that you should have just stayed closeted and said \"no\".  Which is absurd because this is the type of casual equality we're looking for and if you were heterosexual I'm pretty sure this wouldn't even be an issue.", "NTA.\n\nIt's not like you made a huge announcement and went on gushing about it.\n\nSomeone asked you a question, and you answered it casually. Sure, they asked if you had a *boy*friend, but the real intent behind that is just a stereotypically gendered way of asking if you're in a relationship. You answered honestly.", "NTA, you were just having a conversation with a family member. People tend to forget that weddings are get-togethers of family members who often have not seen eachother for quite some time. That is why weddings are fun, it's really not about non-stop fawning over the bride . \n\nSo far I'm pleasantly surprised about the number of NTA's so far.

Not as the day you came out. Your cousin is selfish for constantly wanting all eyes on her when the day is already all about her.

I wonder if your cousin would've been upset about not being the center of attention regardless of the reason or whether it was her wedding day or not.", "NTA.

Her family didn't know and she outed herself making herself a big deal.  Oh she didn't know it would be a big deal...ok", "Come on are you really that thick?  Her family didn't know and she knew that.  It's not like saying you're going vacation.  It's a big announcement and shouldn't be done at someone else's expense.", "It hasn\u2019t. That is a gross reflection of some people. Like wine moms. It\u2019s not healthy and not representative of the majority. Stop generalizing.

What you did is a very big deal especially for older generations. They are not quite hip and come from a very different time and many try too hard and really want to do snd say the right things to be loving and supportive. Be meh what do you care right.

Maybe not intentionally but she did.", "She shouldn't have just started spreading it around either, she should've asked if it was okay to tell others. it's not her business to share.

I just respectfully don\u2019t agree with you. I think it\u2019s fairly normal for people to make conversation at a wedding. Especially if it\u2019s family members who you haven\u2019t seen in awhile. Everyone takes the opportunity to catch up with each other. The idea that all conversation must be limited to only discussing the couple getting married is just so foreign and odd to me.

Why did you add \"stay in the closet filthy homo\"? That is not what was said or implied you did way too much here.", "I didn't say it was wrong, I said it caused a stir that could've been anticipated. It's the same reason the wedding party might be upset if you casually dropped that you're pregnant to the family at a wedding. Why should you hide that you're pregnant? Because it's not the right time.", "I think that OP\u2019s family might be one to make a big deal in general and OP probably knows that. Of course I expect to have conversations at weddings. But if I think people will react to anything I\u2019m going to say, I\u2019d let it wait. And the fact that she DID come out for the first time to them did make it a lot more likely that they\u2019d react, since they didn\u2019t know.

If someone had just gotten engaged or pregnant, and hadn't told the family yet, and someone asked or made a comment, they'd just lie.

If you've got legs, arms, skin, any of that stuff, you're almost definitely an asshole. \n\nIf you disagree with this statement, that's probably because you are, and proof that you are in-fact, an asshole. \n\nHumanity do be like that though.", "Based response lmao", "I didn't say it was all her fault, did I? You don't seem very big on comprehension, and have twice put comments in my mouth that I never said, I said it was a very foreseeable consequence, and to pretend that it wasn't does a disservice to how big that announcement was. If it wasn't, then it would not have been a big deal, but it was.\n\nIt's a very simple question of, what did you really think would happen? That this new knowledge would just quietly be absorbed by everyone? Did you think that everyone would magically be ok with the knowledge? I don't think it should be a big deal, but this is ignoring that IT IS FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE. This reads like a lot of people are judging this ln what they think should have happened, not what was most likely to, and what did happen. It's very simple. DON'T COME OUT, EVEN  CASUALLY, AT A WEDDING. Not that one shouldn't, but read the room, a wedding, with potentially a bunch of older relatives who may not be ok with it, is not the place to do it. It literally does not matter that it's not a big deal to you. It's in who she told, to not be considerate of the potential reaction (Aunt continuing to tell others) was a very foreseeable consequence. Whether the OP thinks it is a big deal or not, is irrelevant. Dodge the question, answer it partially, I don't care... Just don't come out at a wedding and then act surprised that it became a hot topic."]}
