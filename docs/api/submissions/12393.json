Maybe because I'm old, but I don't understand this idea that the bride has to be the central figure of the entire day, and that no one can take their eyes off her or speak of anything but her. I always saw the wedding as a family celebration. The more to celebrate, the better. I find the whole thing weird.", "NTA! There is literally no difference between you having a boyfriend or a girlfriend and you were just being honest about who you are. Your aunt is a little bit an AH for making a big deal out of it at the wedding instead of thinking about how your cousin would feel. Ultimately it was just unfortunate circumstances and it sucks that your cousin felt that way but you did absolutely nothing wrong but be honest about who you are.\n\nTo those saying YTA, would you propose that OP lie about herself on the chance that someone might be interested in her more than a passing congratulatory statement? That's ridiculous.", "NTA \nYou answered a question that is pretty common at any family heavy event in a casual and pretty low key way just like you would have if you were straight. \nThat your aunt chose to gossip about it then as opposed to later is your aunt's problem and nothing you instigated. \n I see some people saying that you should have just stayed closeted and said \"no\".  Which is absurd because this is the type of casual equality we're looking for and if you were heterosexual I'm pretty sure this wouldn't even be an issue.", "NTA.\n\nIt's not like you made a huge announcement and went on gushing about it.\n\nSomeone asked you a question, and you answered it casually. Sure, they asked if you had a *boy*friend, but the real intent behind that is just a stereotypically gendered way of asking if you're in a relationship. You answered honestly.", "NTA, you were just having a conversation with a family member. People tend to forget that weddings are get-togethers of family members who often have not seen eachother for quite some time. That is why weddings are fun, it's really not about non-stop fawning over the bride . \n\nSo far I'm pleasantly surprised about the number of NTA's so far.

Not as the day you came out. Your cousin is selfish for constantly wanting all eyes on her when the day is already all about her.

I wonder if your cousin would've been upset about not being the center of attention regardless of the reason or whether it was her wedding day or not.", "NTA.

I assumed this would be the same. Plus I didn\u2019t wanna feel like I was pretending to be straight, because I guarantee if I just said \u201cno\u201d, she\u2019d continue asking me questions about boyfriends and dating men.\u201d", "She was making conversation, like if someone had asked her \"Do you have a dog?\" and she said \"No, but I have a cat.\" In either case, \"No,\" is technically  a complete answer, but she decided to make conversation by elaborating on her answer. Like you do during social situations.", "I don't hate straight people because of their sexual orientation, but I find it very confusing that straight culture has normalized hating your spouse as a joke.", "You must be too young to remember '80s and '90s sitcoms, and I both feel old and am very jealous of you.", "That this would be more interesting and notable than a heterosexual relationship because no one in the family has come out before.", "No it wouldn't have been talked about the same way if she said she had bf. Her family didn't know and she outed herself making herself a big deal.  Oh she didn't know it would be a big deal...ok", "Come on are you really that thick?  Her family didn't know and she knew that.  It's not like saying you're going vacation.  It's a big announcement and shouldn't be done at someone else's expense.", "It hasn\u2019t. That is a gross reflection of some people. Like wine moms. It\u2019s not healthy and not representative of the majority. Stop generalizing. You are the only one here who is trying to normalize hating a spouse within a relationship", "Lol, touche, those are pretty bad.", "But it doesn\u2019t sound like OP\u2019s family made a scene or even reacted all that differently then had she been in a hetero relationship. So I don\u2019t really get why one is fine and the other isn\u2019t. Both have the same out come \u201coh congratulations. How long have you been together? How did you meet?\u201d \n\nIf OP\u2019s family was ultra conservative and OP knew it would cause a scene, the fine I agree, AH move. But OP didn\u2019t think her aunt would have much of a reaction, and she didn\u2019t really. So taking 5 minutes from a 10 hour event to say \u201cnope, I\u2019m dating a girl\u201d isn\u2019t really the same as deliberately causing a scene or making some grand announcement.", "OP said people congratulated her and asked her questions. How would saying she had a boyfriend be any different?", "Once upon a time, queer people didn't elaborate when they were asked about their romantic relationships because they were afraid of being disowned or arrested or murdered. Now we're supposed to shut up because people might be happy for us, when it should just be completely normal conversation to make."]}
