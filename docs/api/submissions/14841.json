My mom became obsessed with getting closer to Ken's son and invested all her time and energy into bonding with him. He never wanted my mom though. He didn't like that she tried so hard to bond and he rejected her. Mom even had two kids with Ken, my half siblings, but it was like we didn't exist because she was SO focused on Ken's son. There were times I really needed my mom (was bullied in school, had a problem with a friend and needed advice, started my period, etc) and she just wasn't available to me. It was the same for my younger siblings. Ken did most of the raising of them but even then, he worked long hours so they didn't have him very much. Ken's son moved away when he was 17. He went to stay with his grandparent or an aunt/uncle or something and my mom still tried to fly out to see him and spend time with him. She never got anywhere but she tried.\n\nEventually I was old enough to move out and after that mom started sort of trying to focus on my younger siblings.

I think she started paying some attention to me and knew when they were coming. But she was talking about how she prided herself on being a good mom and had dedicated her life to her kids. I found it so insulting given the fact she neglected her actual kids to chase a kid who was not hers, who did not want her and ran like his ass was on fire to get away from her.\n\nAfter my boyfriend left with his parents I told my mom she was delusional if she thought she was a good mom. I told her she abandoned her kids in favor of a stepkid who didn't want or need her and tried to repair some of the damage years too late, when she finally gave up on him coming around. I told her she was a terrible mom to me and a terrible mom to my younger siblings and she should not be telling people the opposite.

As parents, we believe that we\u2019ve always done our best - because to believe otherwise takes a hell of a lot of reflection. Your mum thinks that because she directed her energy into parenting, she did good. But all of that energy sounds like it mostly went towards one child in the family - not good. \n\nI doubt she\u2019ll ever change her perspective, so focus on what you can control. Low contact, lots of therapy, and if you have kids, work on doing better with the next generation.", ">Mom accused me of being jealous and possessive and said I had no right \n\nBecause it's *easier for her to attack and criticize you*, than to reflect and consider whether she possibly made horrible mistakes raising her own kids. Nooooo!\n\nPro tip: if 3 out of 3 biological children are partially or fully estranged, IT'S THE PARENT. \n\nNTA for telling your truth OP, but it won't change a darn thing. Sounds like the best you can do is limit contact with her and live your best life.", "NTA. Your mum played favourites and either didn't realise or won't admit to it. Unfortunately I forsee her having the same conversation with your half siblings in the future", "No, NTA for telling her the truth but don't ever expect her to accept it as the truth or to stop claiming to the world that she was the world's greatest mom.  Speaking from similar experience, she's going to believe that she was a superstar mom until the day she dies, even if every single one of her children tells her otherwise.", "NTA\n\nCan't add much more that what u/Emotional_Koala_ said\n\nOther than to also be there for your half siblings, and Ken's son if he wants you to be there for him", "NTA. You\u2019re not an asshole for expressing your feelings and how you perceived the whole mother child thing. Maybe delusional is a little harsh, but it\u2019s sounds like she didn\u2019t put in any effort, so it\u2019s just a way of telling the truth", "Just because it's true doesn't mean it needs to be said, like what did you hope to accomplish with that? What do you think she's going to do go around and tell strangers that she was a s***** mom? It seems to me like you're just trying to be mean I'm going with yta", "You are entirely at fault. She didn't provoke you. You provoked her and you let your feelings build up over time so much that you exploded and exposed all your baggage out of nowhere. She said she was a good mother, not a perfect one and I'm not saying that you're remiss for feeling neglected. This is likely an issue you need to sort out at therapy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She has ignored me for years and can't just randomly pop up out of nowhere and expect me to be happy about it, or to think the last almost two decades haven't happened."]}
