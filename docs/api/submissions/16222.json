I've known Francesca for almost 12 years, Michael significantly less, but were still good friends. My Fiance and I dont have children due to the fact that 1. I cant/wont birth them and 2. We considered adoption/fostering but havent quite made the final decision yet.\n\n\nMy(25F) and my Fiance (28M) were designated to be the guardians of their children in the event of this tragedy happening. Michael and Francesca had 3 children together (\"Joe\"4M,\"Sara\"3F,\"Tessa\"3F). However-recently Michael's parents have been making comments about adopting Joe, the 4 year old boy, and him coming to live with them. I've since put a halt to these comments but Michael's parents have been spreading it around that it's their right to adopt their grandchildren (although they seem to only want Joe which is its own bucket of issues)\n\n\nNot only do I absolutely not want to give up any of the kids; Joe's Grandparents are old, on Social Security and having a child in the house would strain their budget, let alone 3 that would have to share a room. Meanwhile Fiance and I make around 300k a year (combined, we're both software devs) and the house we're in has all the children their own room, (although I know the books say you shouldn't, we'll also let them sleep in our room if they have a nightmare/are sad, Also the twin girls like to sleep in each other rooms so they actually have 2 beds in both their rooms) and we generally don't struggle in the financial department. \n\n\nSince I've given Michael's parents a firm \"no\" in terms of adopting their grandchildren, I've been inundated with messages (that might be legitimate concern, but also feels like passive-aggressiveness to me) about \"relieving my burden\" and if I really think I'm up to the task of mothering 3 children at my age, etc etc. I've also received a few letters saying I'm robbing M's parents of their child and that it's their right to have their grandchildren, and I'm the asshole for keeping them from them.\n\n\nI will admit the kiddos and us had issues at first, but we enrolled them in counseling and go to family counseling as recommended by the kiddos counselor. \n\n\nSo AITA for not relinquishing custody to the children's grandparents?", "created_utc": 1683041658, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135q8km/aita_for_not_relinquishing_custody_of_my_best/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your friends wanted the grandparents to be the guardians, they would have been named.  It's also really shitty that they want to split those poor kids up.  Good for you, you are an absolute saint for taking the kids into your home.", "I make no comment on legalities of any of this. But presumably your friends designated you as guardians for a reason. Anyone making threats and refusing to be actively and cooperatively involved in supporting their grandchildren in line with the dead parents\u2019 wishes and what is best for the kids - they would be the AH. You aren\u2019t. NTA.", "NTA. You were chosen by the children's parents to be their guardian.\n\nWhy do they just want the boy? To replace the son the lost? I understand they are grieving but you are doing right by the children and your friend.", "NTA. Keep all 3 and give them all the best lives you can under the circumstances. Their grandparents can obviously still be in their lives as grandparents.", "Definitely NTA and I'm sorry for your loss. There is a reason why your friends listed you as guardian and not her parents. Also the \"at your age\" comments? F had the kids at your age. \n\n\nYou're doing all the right things, you have them in counseling, you have the resources. And it's a huge red flag that they are only talking about one of the kids.\n\n\nDid the grandparents have a big presence in their life before? I assume you aren't completely cutting them off? If you're refusing to let the kids see their grandparents, that'd be a different issue. But I'd definitely talk to the lawyer and the kids' counselor about the grandparents, and assure they don't say anything to J about you not letting him live with them or something. \n\n\nBe wary, but also be understanding. They also just lost their daughter and are probably clinging to the kids without actually thinking logistics. Unless it's some sexist, we only want the boy BS.", "NTA. It was their parents' will that you and your husband be the kids' guardians in the event of their untimely passing. The grandparents should be able to visit, sure. But it sounds like you are doing a great job taking care of them. Plus, the grandparents actually think that taking just one of them in is a good plan?? Separating the kids would be devastating, they've already been through so much. They have a stable home now and they are together, which sounds like the best thing for them.", "NTA. But you do let the kids SEE their grandparents, yes?", "If you\u2019re in the US, grandparents have few rights. I\u2019m assuming there was a will that specified what happens to the kids? And that you\u2019ll formally adopt them? \n\nIt\u2019s probably good for the kids to see the grandparents because that\u2019s good for the kids if the grandparents could just be loving stable people. \n\nI doubt these people are being a problem on purpose- they are also grieving. And I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, too. \n\nLooks like you all are parents to these kids. A tragic way to do it but it sounds like your doing the right stuff.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing the right thing. The fact that they\u2019d try to separate grieving siblings over some sexist bullshit is appalling.", "NTA - Your friends made the decision of who they wanted to raise their kids in the event that they couldn't. If you are willing and able to, you should respect their decision. \n\nGrandparents do not have an innate \"right\" to their grandchildren, legally or morally. They are not more fit to parent these children just because they are blood relatives. You have to assume that if your friends wanted the kids to go to the grandparents (or anyone else), they would have said that in their will. \n\nDon't let people tell you that you are unfit because the kids have had trouble adjusting. They just lost their parents and are in a new environment, of course it is difficult!", "NTA\n\nYou were chosen for a reason, trust that the parents made the right choice and stick with it. I\u2019m sure you will do a great job raising their children. As a parent I can tell you, you don\u2019t choose guardians lightly.", "NTA \n\nFrancesca and Michael asked you to be their kids' guardian if something happened to them.  Had Michael wanted his parents to raise one of them, he would have said so.", "NTA - you are following the wishes of the kids parents.  But consult with a family law attorney about how to make this permanent and make sure the grandparents can't do anything to upset the apple cart.\n\nAt the same time though, do the kids spend time with their grandparents and the rest of their parent's family?  That's an important thing to have continue.", "NTA the kids\u2019 parents could have designated them as guardians and chose not. I think it would be disrespectful to them to ignore their wishes. It\u2019s a pretty big deal to send children to non-family when there is family out there to take them in. I don\u2019t think they picked you without considering the consequences, meaning there is probably a reason why they didn\u2019t give the kids to the grandparents. I\u2019d also note that the grandparents probably won\u2019t outlive you and if they take custody and die in 5 years, the kids will be minors, and you might not be able to get them back. Staying with you let\u2019s them have stability and they can still see the grandparents.", "NTA You\u2019re honoring their parents\u2019 explicit wishes, keeping the siblings together and most importantly seem capable and willing to take good care of them. Stay firm for the sake of the children. Good luck!", "Nta you were chosen by their parents for a reason, that reason still stands. They were comfortable enough to yrust you, an that you would do everything to keep them safe and loved. By all means let thd grandparents see them, but be careful they dont try say you are abandoning them. I would also question why the did not choose, any of the other members of their extended family. There obviously is a reason, my advice is simply this, keep doing what you are doing, ignore all the outside noise.", "NTA\nYou were designated in the will for a reason by their parents. Hopefully you have full legal custody. \n\nThe age, health, and lack of cash the grandparents have isn't good for raising children  that young.  The amount of energy alone to keep up with little ones is immense.\n\nBe sure to take steps legally to cover any custody battle.\n\nIn an ideal situation keeping their relatives in contact with the little ones would be encouraged.  But this situation it may be healthier to limit or block contact. \n\nNo telling if they'd be kidnapping threats. Or just old fashioned bad mouthing to poison or brainwash the kids by them. Also the harassment you are receiving is unhealthy.", "NTA in the slightest. Your friends specified you to look after their children,not the grandparents. The grandparents are really, really shitty for wanting to split them up and only take the boy. You have more than enough assets to comfortably look after the children. You are definitely a better age to look after the children.", "Their comment about you not being \"up to the task of mothering 3 children at my age\" (28, their bio Mom's age!) made me laugh.  They'll be - what? - in their 80s when the kids are in high school?\n\nFrancesca and Michael chose you.  It sounds like you and husband are all in to be great parents.  I wish you all the love and luck in the world.  NTA", "Why are you even thinking about this? Their entire behavior is outrageous and they only want your son? LOL! NTA but consult a lawyer and start documenting their behavior.", "NTA. If  Michael and Franchesca had wanted his (or her) parents to be guardians, they would have legally designated them as such. For whatever reason they had, they chose not to, and designated you and your husband instead. I'm not a lawyer but from my understanding they would have no legal grounds in the US to overturn that designation other than some sort of incompetence or moral problem on your parts. They do probably have the legal right to have visits with the kids.  \n\nIf you love those kids and think you can do okay by them then by all means stick to your guns and do not relinquish custody. I think it's very noble what you are doing and wish you the best of luck!", "They made you their children's legal guardians for a reason.\n\nIf they insist they are better suited to taking care of their fgrnadchildren, they can sue you and let a judge decide between the young well-off people that the parent's chose, or the grandparents who are not in the best physical or financial condition.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So, no, they don't have the \"right\" to have their grandchildren.\n\nAnd in my opinion it's very interesting that they only talk about the boy and don't even mention the girls.\n\nIf I was you, I would tell them that you'll honor Michael's wish to care for his children.

Maybe they view him as a younger version of their late son. But anyway, do not hand over custody to them.

If the grandparents can't take all 3, they get NONE. But also if your friends wanted the children to live with ANY family member, then it would have been stated. They chose you for whatever reason and since you're graciously taking in and caring for the children and can provide for them then they are in the right place.
