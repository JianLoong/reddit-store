We considered adoption/fostering but havent quite made the final decision yet.\n\n\nMy(25F) and my Fiance (28M) were designated to be the guardians of their children in the event of this tragedy happening. Michael and Francesca had 3 children together (\"Joe\"4M,\"Sara\"3F,\"Tessa\"3F). However-recently Michael's parents have been making comments about adopting Joe, the 4 year old boy, and him coming to live with them. I've since put a halt to these comments but Michael's parents have been spreading it around that it's their right to adopt their grandchildren (although they seem to only want Joe which is its own bucket of issues)\n\n\nNot only do I absolutely not want to give up any of the kids; Joe's Grandparents are old, on Social Security and having a child in the house would strain their budget, let alone 3 that would have to share a room. Meanwhile Fiance and I make around 300k a year (combined, we're both software devs) and the house we're in has all the children their own room, (although I know the books say you shouldn't, we'll also let them sleep in our room if they have a nightmare/are sad, Also the twin girls like to sleep in each other rooms so they actually have 2 beds in both their rooms) and we generally don't struggle in the financial department. \n\n\nSince I've given Michael's parents a firm \"no\" in terms of adopting their grandchildren, I've been inundated with messages (that might be legitimate concern, but also feels like passive-aggressiveness to me) about \"relieving my burden\" and if I really think I'm up to the task of mothering 3 children at my age, etc etc. I've also received a few letters saying I'm robbing M's parents of their child and that it's their right to have their grandchildren, and I'm the asshole for keeping them from them.\n\n\nI will admit the kiddos and us had issues at first, but we enrolled them in counseling and go to family counseling as recommended by the kiddos counselor. \n\n\nSo AITA for not relinquishing custody to the children's grandparents?", "created_utc": 1683041658, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/135q8km/aita_for_not_relinquishing_custody_of_my_best/", "score": 1126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your friends wanted the grandparents to be the guardians, they would have been named.  It's also really shitty that they want to split those poor kids up.  Good for you, you are an absolute saint for taking the kids into your home.", "I make no comment on legalities of any of this. But presumably your friends designated you as guardians for a reason.

You aren\u2019t. NTA.", "NTA. You were chosen by the children's parents to be their guardian.\n\nWhy do they just want the boy? To replace the son the lost? I understand they are grieving but you are doing right by the children and your friend.", "NTA. Keep all 3 and give them all the best lives you can under the circumstances. Their grandparents can obviously still be in their lives as grandparents.", "Definitely NTA and I'm sorry for your loss. There is a reason why your friends listed you as guardian and not her parents. Also the \"at your age\" comments? F had the kids at your age. \n\n\nYou're doing all the right things, you have them in counseling, you have the resources. And it's a huge red flag that they are only talking about one of the kids.\n\n\nDid the grandparents have a big presence in their life before? I assume you aren't completely cutting them off? If you're refusing to let the kids see their grandparents, that'd be a different issue. But I'd definitely talk to the lawyer and the kids' counselor about the grandparents, and assure they don't say anything to J about you not letting him live with them or something. \n\n\nBe wary, but also be understanding. They also just lost their daughter and are probably clinging to the kids without actually thinking logistics. Unless it's some sexist, we only want the boy BS.", "NTA. It was their parents' will that you and your husband be the kids' guardians in the event of their untimely passing. The grandparents should be able to visit, sure. But it sounds like you are doing a great job taking care of them. Plus, the grandparents actually think that taking just one of them in is a good plan?? Separating the kids would be devastating, they've already been through so much. They have a stable home now and they are together, which sounds like the best thing for them.", "NTA. But you do let the kids SEE their grandparents, yes?", "If you\u2019re in the US, grandparents have few rights. I\u2019m assuming there was a will that specified what happens to the kids?

And I\u2019m so sorry for your loss, too. \n\nLooks like you all are parents to these kids. A tragic way to do it but it sounds like your doing the right stuff.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing the right thing. The fact that they\u2019d try to separate grieving siblings over some sexist bullshit is appalling.", "NTA - Your friends made the decision of who they wanted to raise their kids in the event that they couldn't. If you are willing and able to, you should respect their decision. \n\nGrandparents do not have an innate \"right\" to their grandchildren, legally or morally. They are not more fit to parent these children just because they are blood relatives. You have to assume that if your friends wanted the kids to go to the grandparents (or anyone else), they would have said that in their will. \n\nDon't let people tell you that you are unfit because the kids have had trouble adjusting.

But consult with a family law attorney about how to make this permanent and make sure the grandparents can't do anything to upset the apple cart.\n\nAt the same time though, do the kids spend time with their grandparents and the rest of their parent's family?  That's an important thing to have continue.", "NTA the kids\u2019 parents could have designated them as guardians and chose not. I think it would be disrespectful to them to ignore their wishes. It\u2019s a pretty big deal to send children to non-family when there is family out there to take them in. I don\u2019t think they picked you without considering the consequences, meaning there is probably a reason why they didn\u2019t give the kids to the grandparents. I\u2019d also note that the grandparents probably won\u2019t outlive you and if they take custody and die in 5 years, the kids will be minors, and you might not be able to get them back. Staying with you let\u2019s them have stability and they can still see the grandparents.", "NTA You\u2019re honoring their parents\u2019 explicit wishes, keeping the siblings together and most importantly seem capable and willing to take good care of them. Stay firm for the sake of the children. Good luck!", "Nta you were chosen by their parents for a reason, that reason still stands. They were comfortable enough to yrust you, an that you would do everything to keep them safe and loved. By all means let thd grandparents see them, but be careful they dont try say you are abandoning them. I would also question why the did not choose, any of the other members of their extended family. There obviously is a reason, my advice is simply this, keep doing what you are doing, ignore all the outside noise.", "NTA\nYou were designated in the will for a reason by their parents. Hopefully you have full legal custody. \n\nThe age, health, and lack of cash the grandparents have isn't good for raising children  that young.  The amount of energy alone to keep up with little ones is immense.\n\nBe sure to take steps legally to cover any custody battle.\n\nIn an ideal situation keeping their relatives in contact with the little ones would be encouraged.  But this situation it may be healthier to limit or block contact. \n\nNo telling if they'd be kidnapping threats. Or just old fashioned bad mouthing to poison or brainwash the kids by them. Also the harassment you are receiving is unhealthy.", "NTA in the slightest. Your friends specified you to look after their children,not the grandparents. The grandparents are really, really shitty for wanting to split them up and only take the boy. You have more than enough assets to comfortably look after the children. You are definitely a better age to look after the children.", "Their comment about you not being \"up to the task of mothering 3 children at my age\" (28, their bio Mom's age!) made me laugh.  They'll be - what? - in their 80s when the kids are in high school?\n\nFrancesca and Michael chose you.  It sounds like you and husband are all in to be great parents.  I wish you all the love and luck in the world.  NTA", "Why are you even thinking about this? Their entire behavior is outrageous and they only want your son? LOL! NTA but consult a lawyer and start documenting their behavior.", "NTA. If  Michael and Franchesca had wanted his (or her) parents to be guardians, they would have legally designated them as such. For whatever reason they had, they chose not to, and designated you and your husband instead. I'm not a lawyer but from my understanding they would have no legal grounds in the US to overturn that designation other than some sort of incompetence or moral problem on your parts. They do probably have the legal right to have visits with the kids.  \n\nIf you love those kids and think you can do okay by them then by all means stick to your guns and do not relinquish custody. I think it's very noble what you are doing and wish you the best of luck!", "They made you their children's legal guardians for a reason.\n\nIf they insist they are better suited to taking care of their fgrnadchildren, they can sue you and let a judge decide between the young well-off people that the parent's chose, or the grandparents who are not in the best physical or financial condition.\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They only want to \"adopt\" Joe.\n2. Initialization of the flying monkeys. \n\nNow, as a former foster parent, this is what these red flags mean to me: The boy is older enough to be a bit more independent, so they could conceivably handle him. But then, as soon as he got to a certain age, more specifically school age (1st grader), they could then start subtlely making him more responsible for household chores and such, giving them a break.  know this type of red flag doesn't always mean that. But, my experience as a foster parent tells me \"This is a song I am well acquainted with!\". Some of my kids would let slip that they were anxious about being away from their grandparent's house because \"It's my job to cook and clean! If I'm not there, it won't get done! I'm going to have a huge mess when I get back! I'll miss school to get caught up!\". Spoiler alert, the kidlet in question was a 10 year old girl. Taken from her grandparents house for neglect. And wasn't that a fun year of deprogramming the munchkin! I documented every little verbal slip about her treatment at home, because her grandparents were trying to get her back. Which leads me to my next point. They were trying to get her back because her survivor benefits from social security had been assigned a court appointed trustee. Which meant that the very next payment disbursed went to a trustee account administered by the court appointed trustee. The grandparents had no access to the funds. Boy, were they SALTY about suddenly losing $985 a month in addition to their \"House Elf\"! Thanks to my documentation, the sprogglette went to have therapy and a lot more came out. (Like, I really wanted to go drop them off in the middle of the desert with 1 canteen each and let them walk back.) The girl never went back to their care; CPS was able to find a family member that was a decent human being (Family of her own who was an adult cousin who had no contact with his grandparents because of their behaviors) Little Bit asked if I could go with them to meet him.  I was granted permission and went with her with the promise of \"Honey, if you don't like him or if anything is off, I promise you, they will get you over my dead body\". So, we went. Met a very, very nice retired Marine Gunny Sergeant. Very soft spoken, well mannered, direct eye contact and very, very upfront. When he extended his hand to introduce himself to her, he said \"Hello, X. My name is Y. I'm your [cousin](https://cousin.me). Uncle S is my daddy. I haven't seen you since you were about 2. You couldn't say my name so you called me Thumpie.\". That's as far as he got, because she heard \"Thumpie\" and literally jumped into this man's arms, sobbing uncontrollably. He just sat right down on the floor, crossed his legs and held her, just rocking. I had every concern answered right then and there. Might have liked to hear the story behind a 30 something now 40 something year old man getting the nickname Thumpie from a toddler, but that wasn't really relevant. And he wasn't really all that interested in the survivor's benefits, told them to put them in a savings account for her college fund, he'd cover everything else.\n\nSo, the grandparents might have been told by someone in the flying monkey crowd that there's the potential for a significant monthly payout and want Joe for that. They know they can't handle all 3. Yes, each kidlet would be eligible for a survivors benefit amount, even separated. So, be careful, especially if you weren't aware of the survivor's benefits. (I'd say file and stash the payments into a savings account to use for their college costs, ect, if you can)\n\nI'm sensing there are no motives beyond wanting a \"house elf\" and the greed for the potential of a bump in income.\n\nWalk carefully. Get the legal guardianship settled as soon as possible. Lock it down tight. Share your concerns with the case worker. Start documenting everything. Save every email, voice mail, text message and/or letter. Be ready to present it to a judge.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss. Love and hugs. Be well.", "NTA.

But you\u2019re doing a great job if no one has told you recently!", "Amen get a lawyer op", "Overnights at a friend's house, no, but overnight with close extended family is a bit different. As long as they know the kids' routines and the parents trust them to follow those routines, I'd say 3 and 4 are old enough to stay with a grandparent or aunt/uncle overnight.", "This is perfectly said \u2665\ufe0f", "Amen  i dont trust grans in this case", "NTA. Sounds like you two are all in. Plus, the siblings all get to stay together.", "NAH, you seem to have very little concern about the trauma that the grandparents and kids share in losing the kids' parents. So if you have or plan to use your \"superior\" finances or home to justify keeping the kids away I would strongly advise against that. \n\nI'm sure you're doing everything you think is right but your post makes no mention of anything related to the grandparents still seeing the kids and the kids knowing their grandparents!", "NTA. They named you two the guardians for a reason. Get a lawyer now. That way, if they start anything, you'll be ready. Those poor kids have gone through more than enough losing their parents. Now the grandparents want to split them up and rip one kid away from their guardians, who they are now used to and retraumatize them all over again. It's obvious they wouldn't be able to supply the therapy needed.", "You were appointed guardianship for a reason. Hold your ground, they don't have a leg to stand on. NTA", "NTA.  The parents wanted you to have the kids. You also don\u2019t want the kids to separate, and the grandparents want only one.  Let them come and visit if they must.", "NTA but please make sure they get lots of time, even if you are busy, to see their grandchildren. I would bet that is really what they are worried about, that you will adopt the kids and cut them out of their lives.", "NTA, and anyone who is giving you a hard time about not being old enough to be parents of three at 28 and 31 is being ridiculous, especially if they are from an older generation. The A H move would be to split these poor kids up. Assure the grandparents that you want them to maintain their relationship and will foster it, provided they behave appropriately, and put a firm stop to any talk about changing the guardianship arrangement.", "NTA.\n\nYou and your spouse were specifically chosen by your friends to be their guardians - not the grandparents.  You\u2019re not preventing the grandparents from grand-parenting in any way.  Only wanting to adopt one of the children is also really weird.", "NTA but I would be wary of leaving the kids with them moving forward, and keeping track of any harassment they send your way just in case. They don\u2019t have anything to stand on but that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t try.", "NTA. Can you formally adopt all three?", "Absolutely not. NTA..Their kid didn\u2019t want them to be the adults raising their kids. They had their reasons.\nThe fact that they want only one of the kids is a huge red flag.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your friends.  I think you are doing a wonderful thing and it sounds like you are doing everything possible to do all of the right things.\n\nFirst thing that comes to me is\u2026\u2026there is a reason they didn\u2019t list their parents as guardians.\n\nRemember that.   They chose you over their own parents so that tells me they didn\u2019t want and knew their kids would be better with you.\n\nKeep up the great work !!!", "NTA. These people are gross. Firstly what are they thinking they can manage as retired seniors on social security trying to keep up with a four year old? Secondly, bad mouthing you when they are trying to separate traumatized kids and badmouthing you, just goes to show how badly they should not be guardians of any kids at this point. If I had to guess, I\u2019d say they were trying to make Joe a replacement Michael and that\u2019s why they only want him. Protect those kids at all costs. Get a protective order if they keep harassing you.", "NTA. You can encourage a relationship with the gp\u2019s, but you were designated to raise these babies.", "NTA. The proper guardians are the people the parents chose. If your friends wanted grandparents raising the kids, that's what they would have designated.", "NTA. They wrote their will the way they did for a reason. It sounds like they want a replacement son. They need therapy not a child", "NTA.  So they want to separate the siblings that have already been traumatized by the death of their parents when the children are still so young.  Sounds like they would suck as grandparents and shouldn't even be allowed to be near the kids, let alone be allowed to adopt any of them at all.", "NTA. As a parent who has designated a non-grandparent custodian for my children in the event of our deaths, I want to encourage you in this battle (that you shouldn't even have to fight!) Your friends chose you and your spouse for a reason. Believe them.", "NTA.  I'd be very upset if the people that agreed to take my kids gave them to someone else.  If I didn't want my in-laws or parents to have custody, there was a reason, and blood doesn't change that.", "NTA because the parents wanted you to raise the kids, not Michael's parents. They had their reasons and their wishes must absolutely be honored.", "I'm a guardian to a little boy. I couldn't imagine him having siblings and splitting them up! That would break my heart. Keep them together! It's what the parents would want.", "So how sure you that this isn't about money? Those kids are probably getting social security payments until they're 18. There might even be some other type of money like a life insurance policy that they want to get they're hands on. I mean, you did say they were struggling.\n\nI think it's absolute cruelty to split up the three kids! The fact that they only want one out of three is horrifying! The kids just lost their parents and now they might lose each other too? That's horrible. NTA", "Also, I'm so sorry for your loss, and you're doing a great job!", "Yup, they only want Joe. Poor kid will always be told, your dad didn't like that so you don't, your dad played x so you should as well.", "I'm guessing the last part is at least part of why their parents chose you - they knew your heart would embrace those kids and protect them is their biological parents couldn't.", "I wouldn't do any overnights with people who openly admitted they only care about one child.", "Maybe babysitting at YOUR house some evenings once this calms down and the adoption has gone thru.", "I wouldn't let a child be unaccompanied with someone who wanted to take custody from me.", "Grandparents don\u2019t want all three, they just want the boy \ud83d\ude44\n\nThey think they\u2019re picking out a kitten or something.", "Oh in this specific case, no, absolutely not. I just mean in general.", "NTA you were put on as guardians of these children because their parents KNEW this would happen. They probably saw the grandparents favoring the son and ignoring the girls and trusted you to not only keep their children together buy also protect them from whatever abuse is in store at their grandparents home.", "NTA.  This is why parents write a will and designate guardians. Your friends decided that you were the best choice to raise their kids in the event that something happened to them.  You are fulfilling their wishes.", "NTA. Your friends chose you for a reason. You keep standing up for your and the kids\u2019 rights!", "Just keep saying \u201cyou can have heaps of contact - the more people who love them the better\u201d\n\nNTA", "NTA", "For just the simple fact that they wanted you to have their children NTA \n\nOn a deeper more personal note I don\u2019t think is is good for grandparents to adopt kids. I was adopted by my grandmother I loved the time I had with her I would not change the way it happened for anything but it set me up for heartbreak. She died when I was 12 and her will was completely disregarded by my aunt who stole power of attorney from her in a Alzheimer\u2019s beginning stage. So instead of going to live with the relative she wanted me to live with (her high ranking military granddaughter and equally ranking ROCKET SCIENTIST husband) I was forced to live with said aunt who was emotionally abusive to an insane degree. I was completely traumatized. I made it but it was a bad bad bad situation\u2026", "NTA\n\nMichael and Francesca knew what they were doing because they wanted their children to be raised by YOU for a number of reasons - both emotional, psychological and probably objectively dealing with age and finances. \n\nYou can give the kids the best life - not just materially but also emotionally because you are younger - have more energy and will likely live until they are well into adulthood\n\nThere is no reason for the grandparents not to still have the same grand parenting role they would have had. Sadly with their actions they are the ones that are making it possible there will be a rift. \n\nAnd their wanting to only adopt one child is - and the boy is just awful. Based on that alone I wouldn't want them raising a kid. Not just because they - unlike the real mother in Solomon's Tale - was willing to split the family but also because they wanted the \"male\" and that seems both misogynistic as well as a big red flag that they would load the male grandchild up as a substitute for the dead father instead of letting him be his own person.", "NTA, but you need to consult a family attorney to  ensure that you can keep custody of these children.", "You have it writing, NAH.  If you didn't then you would be in a asshole gray area.  You seem to have the kids best interest in mind so in that case, NAH", "NTA this was literally not your decision, it was their son\u2019s. There are reasons they selected you, and there are reasons they did not select them. Enough said.", "You were given legal guardianship by the parents. Nothing more needs to be said.\n\nThank you for stepping in during this awful time. My sympathies for your losses.\n\nNTA.", "Absolutely NTA \nyour friends wanted YOU, the grandparents can have visits with no more of those comments or you will keep them away. Be gentle but have a girl talk that their child and their partner trusted you to raise these kids and you will do absolutely everything to help them become healthy and kid adults, but they have to stop the assault on you. Empathize with their grief but taking one child away from his sisters isn\u2019t the answer. \nYou\u2019re amazing and these kids are lucky to have you", "nta - you were made the guardians for a reason. the kiddos should have a relationship with their grandparents but a) it would be horrifying to split the kids up, and b) the grandparents don't seem suited to be guardians. hold your ground yall got this!", "NTA. But now I am really curious about what goes down at a \"counselling\" session with a 3-year-old.", "NTA. The grandparents are trying to call dibs on ONE child?? I shouldn't be surprised at how awful that is, but I'm not. (although it does seem straight out of a Dickens novel)  For that reason alone NTA. But also, their parents named you. You were the one they wanted to raise the kids in this scenario, not the grandparents. And it is not difficult to see why they made that decision.", "NTA. \nI\u2019m a parent. My partner and I have discussed at length what would happen to our children if anything were to ever happen to us. We\u2019ve even discussed it with the person/people involved. It was not a decision made lightly. I would assume your friends were the same way. They felt that their kids would be the absolute best off with you, and not with others.", "NTA you were made guardian for a reason, and it's obvious why when they are obsessing with only taking on 1 child and not the others. You sound like you are doing an amazing job and are an amazing guardian", "NTA\n\nYou are following the wishes of their parents.\n\nHowever, You WOULD be TA if you prevented their grandparents from seeing their grandkids.", "I'm getting a bad feeling and think the grandparents are only trying this for the estate. Either way, this isn't an advice forum. Just stay alert, broke people do desperate things. NTA", "NTA - and all the other filler info doesn\u2019t matter. They asked you to be their guardians in this situation. Full stop.\n\nThey should definitely have a relationship with their grandparents, obvs.\n\nSorry for your loss \u2728", "This. Whatever anybody else says, Trust that Francesca and Michael put a lot thought into this and made the decision on what they thought was best for their children.", "Also in the US, one cannot \u201cwill\u201d their children to someone.  Children are not \u201cproperty.\u201d  A court will eventually decide who gets legal custody.  The wishes of the deceased parents don\u2019t mean much either.  \n\nGet a lawyer.  Ask a court to give you temporary custody while awaiting for the adoption to be finalized.  NTA.", "the courts won\u2019t decide because the children\u2019s parents already did before they died.", "the grandparents only want one of their grandchildren. explain how that makes sense.", ">they only want Joe, meaning just the BOY\n\nI picked up on that, too!\n\nNTA", "I thought allowing regular contact actually strengthened the claim for grandparents rights?", "100% this and possibly even after your parental rights are confirmed. People do crappy things.", "I work with children and I call al of them \u201cmy kids\u201d there is nothing wrong with this and it\u2019s truly probably comforting to them. The world needs more people like you. Keep those babies close. Their parents chose you for a reason.", "Anyone who messages you saying it's wrong...  tell them the grandparents only offered to take the boy and you aren't willing to split the kids up after they already lost their parents.\n\nI guarantee you 80% of those people will shut up after they know the grandparents don't want the twin girls...  the other 20% are hopeless and you should just block them.\n\nWhat the grandparents want is horrid, your intuition is right, but I doubt the grandparents are telling these other people the whole story...  fill in the details for them!", "Just to be safe, hire a lawyer that deals in family law and custody arrangements. You should be clear but it's better to know for sure and have a lawyer ready to go should they get nasty and threaten legal action.\n\nYour NTA but as a kid who went through all that crap twice, please protect them and try to pre empt anything they may try.", "Seriously!", "No, they just want to replace their lost son.  The girls can't do that."]}
