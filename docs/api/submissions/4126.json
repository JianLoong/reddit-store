This loss affected the family greatly.\n\nI was devastated. I *really* needed support and love at this time. Of course\nMy Mum did too. I thought we\u2019d share our grief. However, my Mum just wasn\u2019t there for me at all. I struggled when we talked, because she never asked how I was doing with the death of my father. She did talk about how *she* felt, and I wanted her to talk to me about that. But there didn\u2019t seem to be any time for me to receive any kind emotional support whatsoever from her. I was always the one to talk or start a conversation she never initiated it. Even when I called her and she\u2019s was busy and said she\u2019d call me back, she didn\u2019t.\n\nI found myself calling her less frequently and then feeling bad about it, but at the same time, becoming silently resentful because of her seeming to have zero common sense and practically ignoring the fact that I\u2019d lost a parent and that we needed to help each other grieve. To make matters worse just over a month after my Dad died she\u2019s got into a new relationship with my uncle! My Dad\u2019s brother! I was so fucking angry and felt as if they had both just betrayed him. They were so close already that I suspect that they were having an affair before he died. That was the final straw. One of the things that my Dad had done for me before he died was give me money to buy a few properties so that I could rent them out and have a steady source of income every month and live in one of them. After my friends helped me with my grief instead one of them who lives in Sweden suggested that I move there and see it as a \u201cnew start\u201d. I did the math and realised I could afford to rent a one bed flat/apartment in Sweden with all the utilities paid for from using the money I got from renting out my other properties. So I just did it. I moved and told no one. Of course after a while she noticed I wasn\u2019t living in my flat full time (I still have it and stay there when I visit the UK as I split my time between the two countries). She asked where I was and I explained everything. She obviously said I was an asshole, but then I got a call from my grandparents saying the same.

Feel free to ignore her or say \"Mom, if you had made an effort to actually ask about my life, I would have been happy to tell you. You expressed no interest in me at all since Dad's death so I assumed you didn't care. That's on you, not me.\"\n\nBTW, I totally know how this feels. When my MIL passed (she was my surrogate mother because mine was abusive), my FIL made our grief all about him, even going so far as to tell us that he was the only person entitled to grieve and our feelings of loss were irrelevant. This ended up destroying the relationship between him and me and my spouse. He refused to get grief counseling and remains an AH to this day. We are LC and it sucks to lose both parents at once. So I'm sorry for both of your losses.", "NTA. Judging by the fact that you were able to move countries, you're an adult. You can live where you want.\n\nJudging by your mother's behavior too, it seems like she really took advantage of your willingness to be there for her. It's okay for her to be upset and lean on her loved ones- in fact, that's healthy- but the fact that she did it without so much as thinking to offer you support is completely scummy.\n\nEven as adults, children do not exist to be emotional support systems for their parents. You deserve the time and space to work through things on your own pace.\n\nHave you considered seeking a therapist that specializes in grief counseling? Having someone just to talk and help you get through it could be a massive help if it's within your means.", "I'm curious how long it took her to notice you were gone. \n\nEveryone has to grieve in their own way, on their own timetable. You did what was best for you. I understand your family's hurt that they didn't know about your move, but you didn't cut all ties. NTA", "NTA, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. What you did was brave to give yourself a new start. It\u2019s your life and you needed time to process.

Excluding your mom and uncle, I get why other relatives would justifiably be somewhat upset at this.\n\nIts your life, but if your close with any of your other relatives I think communicating what is going on, and why you left.  Could be beneficial.  They are most likely in the dark on some things.", "The first part of the situation would make you TA. Everyone processes grief differently. Just as your mom spoke about her grief, you could\u2019ve spoken about yours. \n\nI changed my judgment after you disclosed the fact that she and your uncle started up a relationship that may have even begun while she was still married to your dad.

I\u2019m sorry, but I cannot really fault your mom for not having emotional resources for you after losing her husband.  It would have been ok if you had told her that you couldn\u2019t support her and that she needed to get professional help or whatever.  But his death clearly left her in a terrible spot and I can\u2019t fault her for not having emotional energy to support your grief. \n\nI also can\u2019t blame you for moving and trying to restart; that is totally your choice and you should do what is right for you.  I think you are perhaps being hasty in cutting people off as much as you have but, again, your choice.\n\nLest you think I have no idea what I\u2019m talking about, I was a Daddy\u2019s girl and my mom was utterly broken by his death. Just devastated. I was a huge amount of her support and, no, I didn\u2019t get much from her.   But I didn\u2019t expect it.  She lost someone she had been married to for almost 40 years; I\u2019ve been married for 11 now and the thought of losing my spouse is devastating.\n\nYou both are grieving, and chances are that neither of you were exactly what the other person needed.

That sounds awful.", "It took her about a month and a half to realise I was gone.", "To be completely honest with you after my Dad died it seemed like the glue that had kept our family together had dissolved with his death. My mum\u2019s utter lack of care and support after he died made me feel as if she didn\u2019t really care about me at all. She hardly ever called me or visited me. Even if she\u2019d just called to check in on me would\u2019ve been *something*. It was almost like I didn\u2019t even exist anymore. I know people deal with grief in different ways, I understand it was probably 10X harder on her than it was for me, but my fucking dad had died and she didn\u2019t offer me support or comfort or anything, not even once!

On reflection I can see why my grandparents would feel hurt by the fact I didn\u2019t tell them but they mainly berated me over not telling my mum and how I wasn\u2019t \u201cbeing fair\u201d and being \u201ctoo judgmental\u201d about her and my uncles new relationship.", "You mean by carrying on with her bil? I guess that\u2019s one way to do it. Doesn\u2019t mean OP has to like, much less accept it.", "My experience is that grief does really weird things to normal people. It absolutely sucks.", "Yeah, definitely, NTA", "Well acceptance doesn't mean you're ok with something. You're just acknowledging that it's happening. OP's mom can do whatever she wants. Just like OP can. \n\nAs a side note, turtles fucking suck.", "I guess that\u2019s what happened here. I was always closer to my Dad, I was definitely a daddy\u2019s girl, he was my hero. But I never thought my mum and I weren\u2019t close or anything. I want to believe that grief changed her and made her blind my pain.", "That\u2019s true, and appears to be what\u2019s happening. I don\u2019t think OP is TA for not telling her he was moving though. An engaged, but not estranged parent would know these things. Ngl, love your last sentence, they do!

You lost a parent, which is irreplaceable. She lost a partner, which in this case with her seems replaceable... \n\nGrief can do strange things to people but she had no right to monopolise grief and invalidate yours.

You didn't just lose one parent... you lost both of them, except one is through their own selfish behaviour.

Its really creepy that she got with your dads brother. Especially so sokn after his death. And she wasnt emotionally there for you. That being said it wouldnt have hurt to text her and be like hey i moved to sweden", "She did and hopped on his brother.", "> I want to believe that grief changed her\n\nWhat grief? Didn't she start dating your uncle a month after her husband died?\n\nHer actions are not those of a grieving widow. The disconnect between the two of you may be because she doesn't know how to relate to your grief. She's moved on, and is happy to be with your uncle -- while you are 'stuck in the past'."]}
