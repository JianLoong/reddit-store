This was my post from a few days ago:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151cjib/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mother_after_she_ruined_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1\n\nI just wanted to say thank you to everyone who reassured me and who shared their opinions on the matter. I do have some news to share that I think would be a bit of a relief, as well as some clarification on things that were rather worrying.\n\n1. My mother is not an alcoholic. I noticed a few redditors stating that her behavior was typical traits of an alcoholic, and one person told me to look around the house. There isn\u2019t any alcohol that she drinks around the house, and she hadn\u2019t drank any alcohol since the incident. The reasons I know she hasn\u2019t drank any are these:\na.) Her father (my grandfather) is elderly, and a recovering alcoholic. Like I stated before, we take care of him. The slightest smell of alcohol, even just alcohol wipes, can cause him to become sick.\nb.) She has been between these three places for the past few days: work, home and our grandfather\u2019s abode. She wouldn\u2019t even be able to buy any.\nc.) The only alcohol in the house currently is leftover beer. None of us enjoy beer (including my father).\n\n2. My mother does have some undiagnosed issues. We suspect she has some form of BPD, autism and ADHD. Possibly all three, as I ended up with those three personally.\n\nOnto the actual update:\n\nI applied for college and got in. When I told my mother, she seemed relatively upset; likely because I didn\u2019t tell her when I\u2019d be applying. I applied the very night that everything happened, and was accepted this morning. Later on, she came into my room.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what she talked with my father about, but the two have begun sleeping in the same bedroom again. For clarification, my mother slept on the couch for a while, and last night, they were in the same room. When she entered my room, she and I talked a bit. She explained how sorry she was about the graduation ordeal, and also told me how proud she was of me. She also said that she was now banned from Fireball (an alcoholic shot, I think).\n\nHopefully, everything turns out fine now. Thank you to everyone for your support, and thank you to everyone who stayed around to read this fully :)", "created_utc": 1689782385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153z012/update_aita_for_yelling_at_my_mother_for_ruining/", "score": 311, "replies": ["Not sure why a parent would be disappointed in their kid getting into college, but congrats on getting accepted into college!

When your life has been a certain way for in this case 24 years and now it's all changing its both scary and disappointing if you liked that life.", "But it is NOT tequila - or worse:  SAMBUCA!", "Congratulations, graduate!

Likewise, if desperate enough, they'll drink stuff they hate.", "None of your reasoning about why your mom cant be an alcoholic makes sense to me she sounds like one to me and I was one. Trust me when I say they are good at hiding it she might not be i guess but she sure as shit sounds like one", "Reading your original post, it sounded exactly like my mom with diagnosed BPD. If you were a little older id think one of my siblings wrote your post. Not trying to armchair diagnose anyone, but I would look more into your mom having BPD or another cluster B disorder and how to heal from that. Her disorder doesn't have to control your life."]}
