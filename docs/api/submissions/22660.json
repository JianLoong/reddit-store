This was my post from a few days ago:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/151cjib/aita_for_yelling_at_my_mother_after_she_ruined_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1\n\nI just wanted to say thank you to everyone who reassured me and who shared their opinions on the matter. I do have some news to share that I think would be a bit of a relief, as well as some clarification on things that were rather worrying.\n\n1. My mother is not an alcoholic. I noticed a few redditors stating that her behavior was typical traits of an alcoholic, and one person told me to look around the house. There isn\u2019t any alcohol that she drinks around the house, and she hadn\u2019t drank any alcohol since the incident. The reasons I know she hasn\u2019t drank any are these:\na.) Her father (my grandfather) is elderly, and a recovering alcoholic. Like I stated before, we take care of him. The slightest smell of alcohol, even just alcohol wipes, can cause him to become sick.\nb.) She has been between these three places for the past few days: work, home and our grandfather\u2019s abode. She wouldn\u2019t even be able to buy any.\nc.) The only alcohol in the house currently is leftover beer. None of us enjoy beer (including my father).\n\n2. My mother does have some undiagnosed issues. We suspect she has some form of BPD, autism and ADHD. Possibly all three, as I ended up with those three personally.\n\nOnto the actual update:\n\nI applied for college and got in. When I told my mother, she seemed relatively upset; likely because I didn\u2019t tell her when I\u2019d be applying. I applied the very night that everything happened, and was accepted this morning. Later on, she came into my room.\n\nI\u2019m not sure what she talked with my father about, but the two have begun sleeping in the same bedroom again. For clarification, my mother slept on the couch for a while, and last night, they were in the same room. When she entered my room, she and I talked a bit. She explained how sorry she was about the graduation ordeal, and also told me how proud she was of me. She also said that she was now banned from Fireball (an alcoholic shot, I think).\n\nHopefully, everything turns out fine now. Thank you to everyone for your support, and thank you to everyone who stayed around to read this fully :)\n\nEDIT 1: please stop referring to my mother as an alcoholic.", "created_utc": 1689782385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/153z012/update_aita_for_yelling_at_my_mother_for_ruining/", "score": 388, "replies": ["Not sure why a parent would be disappointed in their kid getting into college, but congrats on getting accepted into college!

When your life has been a certain way for in this case 24 years and now it's all changing its both scary and disappointing if you liked that life.", "But it is NOT tequila - or worse:  SAMBUCA!", "Congratulations, graduate!

Trust me when I say they are good at hiding it she might not be i guess but she sure as shit sounds like one", "Reading your original post, it sounded exactly like my mom with diagnosed BPD. If you were a little older id think one of my siblings wrote your post. Not trying to armchair diagnose anyone, but I would look more into your mom having BPD or another cluster B disorder and how to heal from that. Her disorder doesn't have to control your life.", "Sounds like mom has some issues because of your grandpa having alcohol problem. It tends to cause mental health problems for whole family", "Fireball takes out the really you\n\nMy mom had way too much fireball, like, WAYYYYY TOO MUCH, and she started yelling about how my dad was cheating on her (he wasn\u2019t lol, he talked to a girl at a football game once and my mom thought that was cheating, it wasn\u2019t anything that bad). And started running around the south side of our town screaming about it\n\nI went with my brother, who was 17 so I was 13, and eventually we found her outside an elementary school borderline-hysterical. My brother was PISSED, my dad barely noticied since he was drunk and I hated when she was drunk so I wasn\u2019t the happiest.\n\nWe got her home, eventually, and my brother took all the alcohol in the house (at least $1,000 worth, my parents spend big on the stuff), put it in a laundry basket, and almost threw it all out before my grandparents convinced him not to. \n\nAfter that we stayed at our grandparents for a while. Parents never really acknowledged the situation besides sometimes laughing about it, but I make sure she stays away from too much fireball\n\nTL;DR: don\u2019t fuck around when it comes to fireball", "Really? It\u2019s easy for me to believe. Boozes come in and out of popular favor. Several years ago it was all the rage. Before that (at least in the States), Absolut [whatever flavor] was en vogue. \n\nWhy, I recall vodka only had but one flavor when I was a young\u2019un tending bar! The early 00s it was\u2026 *starts whittling a shot glass*", "Hey so I started out at a great, world renowned state university. And lol i flunked so fucking quickly while paying super high tuition. So many life factors\n\nI\u2019ve been doing CC now though, and I seriously prefer it. It\u2019s a more intimate learning environment, and I do it online. You will do great!! Also idk if you know this but you can do online CC classes at CCs across the country! Out of state tuition tends to be like 10% higher. Seriously am pissed about the stigma CC had in my childhood", "Good. I hope you are getting effective therapy for your autism, BPD, and ADHD.", "I don't think your mother is an alcoholic.\nI think she may have too much on her plate with caring for her eldery alcoholic father, her job, taking care of her family and marital problems with perhaps some metal illness as the cherry on top. It sounds like she isn't doing too well and like it is all too much. At your graduation she lost control as a result of that. It isn't okay that she did that but she is only human and will make mistakes. It is a clear sign that she needs help though, both metal help and perhaps also help to lessen her load.", "Yeah, that\u2019s why she\u2019s now been banned from drinking fireball. She once got very drunk with moonshine strawberries\u2026 none of us knew they were moonshine strawberries beforehand \ud83d\ude2d", "Glad things worked out for you", "It sounds like finding out you applied to college without telling her was the wakeup call she needed to realize her behavior was breaking down her relationships. I'm glad she's working on fixing herself, and if she *does* have what you mentioned, I hope she's able to seek a diagnosis and learn how to manage them soon!\n\nI'm not going to pile onto the alcoholism thing since it seems to be upsetting you (I know it certainly did when people pointed out my own dad's alcoholism when I was your age), but I would implore you to look up the concept of a functioning alcoholic. Alcoholism doesn't always look one specific way, and she doesn't need to be drinking every day or hiding alcohol around the house to be considered one. That being said, it *is* possible she just got wasted after letting the stress build up for too long, so who knows.\n\nAll that aside, I'm glad you were able to work things out, and congrats on going to college!", "Ah the memories.  Liquid burn.", "I feel like people without much experience with alcoholics don't really get that it doesn't look one specific way. I know alcoholics who don't drink like 90% of the time but once they do they absolutely lose it every time. It's possible that's the case with OP's mom.", "I did that myself and it was a HUGE money saver! Community colleges really need to be normalized!"]}
