I told him that the night my nightmare was the worst night of my life. Andrew hugged me at first, but then he told me that his wedding was \"his day\" and made me promise not to cry and \"make a scene\" (his own words) during the actual wedding. So I promised him.

I don't think you did this out of malice, nor do I think you're a bad person for telling your longtime friend about your feelings and trauma. Also, from the sound of things, you were perfectly cordial during the ceremony itself and did not \"make a scene.\" All of that said, other commenters are right when they say that that day was not an appropriate day for you to have that conversation with Andrew. There is a time and a place, and the time and place is not on the day of the wedding of one of your longest friends. \n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would let Andrew know (preferably in person) that you are sorry for dampening his mood on his wedding day, and that while it wasn't your intent, you can understand why he is upset. I would also highly, highly recommend that you seek out a well-qualified and compassionate therapist if you don't have one already.

YTA", "YTA. The dude was about to get married and was clearly going through his own thing. This was a terrible time to essentially trauma-dump on the poor guy.", "Soft YTA. You don't choose someone's wedding day to pour your heart out to them. It's already a highly emotional day for them. That being said I am sorry for what happened to you.", "YTA. I'm sorry for your loss, but you should have been composed enough at Andrew's wedding that he wouldn't have asked you what was wrong, and if you couldn't manage that, your answer should have been, \"Sorry, focus on your wedding today.\"  \n\n\nVery soft YTA, though, since he did ask.", "Sorry, but YTA. Hours before his wedding is not the time for you to have a breakdown and emotionally vomit all over Andrew.

You need a therapist for this, not the Fkn groom.", "YTA - I feel bad saying that, because it sounds like you've got some form of PTSD from the accident, but you didn't need to tell him or do/say anything to detract from his day.\n\nPlease seek out counseling to help you deal with the trauma surrounding the accident.", "Soft YTA. It's his wedding day, the man has a lot on his mind and you just dumped your trauma purse all over his lap. Was this a friend of his as well?

A quick \"Oh, it's nothing, I'll be okay. So excited for you today!\" was what you needed to do here. \n\nI also sincerely recommend you seek therapy for this accident. It sounds horrific and tragic and all of those things, but it sounds in many ways like you're still frozen at that point in time, especially if a dream can essentially bring you back to the tragedy a few days after you've had it as this one seems to have done. Therapy would be an invaluable tool in helping you move forward.", "YTA. Time and a place. The time to suck up emotional labor from him was not when he was about to get married, and likely feeling extremely emotional and nervous himself. Main Character Syndrome here.", "Soft YTA, Andrew probably didn\u2019t think when he asked you what was wrong that you would have something so majorly emotional to talk about. I think you should be unloading this in therapy not just hours before his wedding. I also feel like you should have waited to ask him about it until after his honeymoon.

They can teach you how to separate the overwhelming emotions from the memory of the event to help you move forward in processing your grief.", "YTA\n\nYou could've talked to him about it another time and you chose a time when he's supposed to be thinking about is life with the woman he's married, not about your nightmare.", "YTA you need therapy. You could have said anything else. But you didn't. You decided to dump your verbal diarrhea on Andrew on what was meant to be the happiest day of his life. Instead you made it about you and your fears.", "Why the hell would you trauma dump on Andrew ON HIS WEDDING DAY? About someone he also knew and loved?? Seriously! You did ruin his day and the mood.

Now go get yourself into therapy and send your friend an apology letter and small, tasteful gift basket.", "Yep YTA get some therapy. If a nightmare days before an event caused you to wail, then have an impromptu outpouring you are not remotely over it. You shouldn't have gone. You could have apologized, said you had a very rough go of it and bail.

Myself, I would send a very thoroughly thought out message to him apologizing and tell him you understand why it ruined the most important day of his life.  There\u2019s nothing you can do to fix it.  Tell him you want to truly be a good friend and want help becoming a thoughtful friend.

But if you can't be your authentic self with your friends even on their wedding days then who can you be honest with. Again, was it convenient? No. Was it planned sabotage? No. It was one of those things that sometimes happens. Car accidents, early labors, huge blow-up battles occur in the hours prior to weddings and other important ceremonies. Maids of honor melt down and confess marital struggles. Wedding party members hook up after a night of drinking (sometimes when they're married to non-wedding party people) and things get very awkward. This is rather innocent and tame in comparison to that high drama, attention-whoring behavior! \n\nWe are never going to convenience-proof life even on special days.

I know plenty of people who would've unabashedly milked the attention cow without caring at all that the day wasn't supposed to be about them. \n\nHaving said all of that, OP, it might be in your best interests to get some therapy to help process the survivor's guilt and grief you're still carrying. The dream you had involving Andrew sounds more like it comes from a place of trauma and it spun you up prior to seeing your old friend. You gotta figure out how to handle being triggered so you don't inadvertently trigger others with your stuff. And people in general need to learn how to let other people's stuff be theirs and not take on extra baggage.

My wife is not here to ask, but I bet she would support that too.\n\nWe are in a culture that devalues relationships and valorizes weddings.

I know when and when not to. I rarely even talk to anyone outside of therapy. The OP was fully in Main Character mode. The trauma occurred YEARS ago. She should have had therapy, or at least plenty of time to know this is wrong behavior. Trauma dumping can trigger others to have their own flashbacks. The friend from the crash was probably HIS friend too, and the last thing he needed was this. She was selfish. The fact he told her not to cause scenes and kept watching her tells me she does this a lot. This isn't out of control....this is her known behavior pattern.", "I agree with you. I\u2019m going with a gentle YTA. It seems that she\u2019s not worked through the trauma and something has triggered it. Sometimes trauma affects our judgement. Accept the fact that you f\u2019d up, and find some way to work through your trauma, hopefully with a professional. Leave your friend alone for now. Once he\u2019s returned and settled, give him a sincere apology for centering his day on your fear.", "Kinda smells like pick-me energy or she has beef with the bride, who isn't mentioned once here. Maybe a crush on the groom.\n\n\"Hanging out\" 1 on 1 on his wedding day then messaging him on his honeymoon? \n\nAin't passing the smell test.", "Going somewhere else was almost certainly an option. Also, if this was a close friend's wedding, you would have to imagine she had other friends somewhere in the vicinity she could have talked to.", "\u201cAre you OK, you look kinda down\u201d \n\n\u201cI had a bad dream that\u2019s sorta messing with me but I am fine and so excited for your wedding today\u201d \n\nNot just turn him into a therapist so he can go stand at the alter with the weight of her emotions on his shoulders. \n\nIt\u2019s incredibly selfish, she had the dream days before the wedding so it\u2019s not like it was fresh she could have easily waited to talk to him about it or spoke with a licensed therapist about it. Instead of forcing someone to carry her emotions on what should be a very happy day for them.", "She just asked how he was doing, if he didn\u2019t want to answer he could have answered when he got back home. Sending the text on the honeymoon is the \u201cworst\u201d thing op did in this situation in my opinion, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s even that bad. NAH.", "A bunch of friends and family text me on my honeymoon just to check in on if I was having a good time. I don't think it's that unusual", "An appropriate, emotionally mature response would have been ' I didn't sleep well, please don't worry about me, enjoy your day'.", "We don't even know if he asked or not. Her whole story sounds fishy.", "So should Andrew just ignore her being obviously upset even though they were alone?", "Bold to assume that answering a friend's question honestly means one is lacking in maturity.", "For real. Imagine being pissed throughout your whole wedding ceremony because a friend was upset about something unrelated. I\u2019d love to see the wedding photos.", "She's still the asshole for calling the groom on his freaking honeymoon", "How is a day specifically about you getting married and that YOU PAID FOR not about you??? What???", "How did she deal with them? Accidentally crying in a room alone with a close friend?? Personally if I'm getting married, and a close friend broke down in front of me beforehand while we were ALONE, I wouldn't be an asshole and remind her that \"this is my day\" and then glare at her the whole ceremony.\n\nAlso, crying is normal at weddings, so even if she teared up no one would think twice about it.\n\nOP = A resounding NTA", "That\u2019s definitely true. I had a friend in college whose gf at the time would give him the silent treatment every time she had a dream that he cheated on her. I really hope she grew out of that.", "Oh my god.  So, this reminded me of something.\n\nMy husband passed away 5 years ago.\n\nAbout 3 years after that an old friend from High School that I hadn't seen in over 20 years and who never knew my husband called me.  She had a dream about my husband and said he had a message for me.\n\nThe message made no sense and was kind of insulting.  It was along the lines of \"He wants you to know everything will be okay and even though you're struggling you're doing a good job.\"\n\nIt was so out of the blue.  After talking more, it turns out her daughter had recently come out as a lesbian and she was having difficulty with it and needed reassurance and I think picked me because I'm not part of her immediate group and no longer live near her so I was \"safe\" to confide it.\n\nThe whole thing was super weird and I haven't heard from her since.", "She seems to be the overly dramatic type. It doesn't appear she is telling the whole story. I don't believe this is the first time she's made things about her or was drama. From the dudes reaction to OP it sounds like she does this a lot. She also reached out to him on his honeymoon. She is either in love with him or has some unprocessed feelings.", "Also, completely inappropriate to message him on his honeymoon to.", ">if he really was watching her through the whole wedding then it sounds like they've been down this road before with stuff.\n\nI'd say that this is a common occurrence with the OP, I'd also say that the couple getting married were in two minds about inviting her.", "That's if he really watched her or \"glare\" at her in the first place. Dude just got told on his wedding day that she dreamt he fucking died. He probably was going through a lot of emotions standing up there. And you how it goes, a narcissist will always make everything about them.", "That's really good info, thanks! I'm really glad they offer that. OP, should definitely look into something like that and see if they offer it where they live.\n\nI totally empathize with OP being traumatized and having PTSD due to this but they definitely need to get help because 1) no one deserves to live like this 2) it's very negatively impacting their life and relationships.", "I've been in wedding, had a wedding and officiated weddings. No matter how much you would like it to be simple, people's major life stuff can't always be scheduled or boxed up for someone else's convenience. And she *didn't* ask for emotional support. He asked, she answered.", "Honestly I think she did dump on him on purpose. The dream was about him and she somehow found the small window on his day to unload it on him and apparently no one else. \n\n\nNot to mention she reached out to him yet again on his honeymoon when it's not something most friends would do, and asked him how he was doing but didn't want to hear how he was actually doing. How is she so surprised he's not in a good mood when she told him about a nightmare she had of him being killed by a hit and run driver on his wedding day. \n\n\nIMO she wasn't being genuine when she reached out and asked how he was doing since she's writing the story like him being truthful about his feelings=being narcissistic. So I think there's more \"purpose\" to her behavior than she's letting on.", "What should OP have done, given that he could tell she was upset and asked her about it? Asking in all sincerity because i could see myself doing something like this. (I'm not great at hiding my feelings, and there are a few people in my life who can tell my mood no matter. I also rarely have luck trying to deflect/lie or postpone the convo.)", "It kept his attention on her and not should be his celebration and his bride/wife. I'm wondering whether his bride noticed and queried it. She would have noted his spoiled mood and if he shared, then it affected her as well. She also selfishly messaged him on his honeymoon. Leave them alone, for heaven sake. Does she have anyone else? Even a therapist? Sorry, op acted like a very spoiled, entitled brat. \n\n For that, she's atrocious. Was there no one else to dump this on? Anyone apart from the bride and groom? When he thinks about his wedding, he'll be stuck with this memory.\n\nOp is so wrong here.", "Good god, I had a wedding at city hall, it was me and my husband and a dude with a big beard officiating. Then we went outside and our families were waiting and they cheered a bit and then we walked to a nearby park and had a pick-nick our friend made. I didn\u2019t even buy a dress or new shoes. It was the most low key, informal, chill and frugal wedding a person could conceivably have outside of prison. We didn\u2019t care that much about the wedding itself. And I would have still resented a friend who chose that day to break down to me (especially about something that happened years ago!) and bring up drama that I had to deal with. Nope, that is just incredibly selfish. Main character syndrome. \n\nAnd then to message on the honeymoon.. holy smokes. OP needs to learn boundaries. Also possibly find another crush.", "Yes, this! My good friends and I always check first to see if the other person is capable of handling things atm. It helps save both parties from being burdened by another's trauma or being hurt that the other person didn't give appropriate response. People have different emotional capacity.", "That's not how the brain and other systems in the body work. As I said, big events can flood the brain with all sorts of neurochemical cues which can trigger the recall of other high intensity memories. The body can't always tell the difference between positive stress and negative stress. Sometimes, anticipation and excitement for a friend's wedding can produce the same signature as anxiety and fear. (This can happen even in people who don't have clinical conditions.) \n\nAs to \"it must have been upsetting to him, he had to keep monitoring her throughout the wedding,\" no. Clearly it was upsetting to him, but he chose to monitor her with very little empathy. He did not assume she was capable of managing her responses, which proved to be a false assumption on his part as she did not cause any kind of scene. That was a choice on his part and it was a poor one.", "Even people in treatment have moments like this, because millions of years of evolutionary adaptations which make us the quirky social animals we are. That millions of years of evolution doesn't stop applying because someone's getting married. Hell, even people who don't have clinical grade unresolved trauma have moments like this.", "There\u2019s a difference between responding to an innocuous question with a \u2018oh nothing, we\u2019ll talk about it later\u2019 and \u2018thanks for asking, pull up a chair and let\u2019s go 9 bells of trauma and weeping\u2019. He asked a polite question and clearly wasn\u2019t looking for a meltdown. Like size up the room dude. This was not her day.", "Exactly this. What happened to her is terrible and it's not her fault but it's her responsibility to deal with it. And this comes from someone that struggled a lot with mental health. This happened few days before the wedding, she had enough time to talk to him, or she could talk to someone else. Sometimes you have to suck it up especially for people that are there for you, the least you can do is hold the tears for few hours. Is it healthy? No. But is it necessary sometimes? Definitely yes. And if the story ended there I would have said that this was her PTSD and probably she couldn't control it but she contacted him on his honeymoon? Why? This gives major 'main character syndrom' vibes. \nOP, I'm sorry for what happened to you but YTA.", "I thought the exact same thing here!", "But even so, I can't imagine ever texting a friend while on their honeymoon.  \n\nThe only way would be if I knew they'd be back around a certain time and I might start with \"hey are you back\".  She seemed to know it was the middle of the honeymoon.", "If he doesn't want to hear the truth because it might stress him out, yes. I don't ask how people that I know have problems are doing if I don't wanna deal with the aftermath of a no.", "I don't care at what event, if you ask me how I'm doing ill be honest.\n\nPeople are so unkind I hate it. We are taught to always hold it in and see it as mature, when the *actual* mature thing to do is be open and not be afraid of showing emotions.\n\nI grew up holding in my emotions. Now I suffer from numbing which is a CPTSD thing and trauma response.\n\nOP clearly is traumatized. That's not something you can control.", "It is if you know that you're about to have an emotional breakdown on their wedding day. That doesn't just happen. Edit: Emotional maturity includes realizing when is a bad time to bring up something, even if it's bothering you. Gotta read the room.", "She needs to have some decorum", "Jesus. I thought that was a thing that was only true in stand up comedy", "I knew a woman and a man like this.  they had no handle on there emotions and had the worst main character syndrome I had ever seen.", "Yeah, that's just a narcissist right there", "It's bizarre to me that she felt it was appropriate to tell the groom she had a dream about him a few days ago where he was *hurt/killed by a drunk driver* and then instead of even letting him digest that, segue into Terry and then her grief and trauma. This was so inappropriate. I can't imagine about to leave on a flight or drive to my honeymoon after with that imagery in my head. \n\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, she *reached out to him* after he's all settled in on his honeymoon to ask him how he's doing but doesn't like when he tells her how it fucked up his mood. She creates angst in her wake and isn't happy he's trying to now talk it through. Makes me think she reached out just so she could tell him how hurt she was and to get an apology, not to hear him talk about how he's really doing.", "You know, the possibility of her having feelings for him briefly crossed my mind. I think you\u2019re right though about this probably not being her first time acting like this!", "I thought of this as well I mean why message him on his honeymoon. Isn\u2019t that an automatic \u201cdo not disturb\u201d time period for a couple. It sounds like she just wants his whole wedding and relationship to be depressing.", "It sounds more like OP has main character syndrome. She doesn\u2019t like it when the attention is off her, and does these things to draw it back to her.", "I am leaning towards just being a garden variety narcissist. She doesn't stop to think if she should, just finds herself in a never ending loop of doing what she wants and then finding out she's upset someone but not being able to understand why.", ">It doesn't appear she is telling the whole story.\n\nI'm wondering why she used \"attention whore\" in the title but doesn't mention that phrase being used in the story. Did she leave that part out?", "Her username is GhostOfAChance, I\u2019d say feelings are definitely involved. \n\nTrauma dumping on the groom\u2019s wedding day is bad form and beyond needy. \n\nYTA", "What? You think the girl who had an intensely tragic dream about her friend being hurt/killed just before his wedding and started crying to him about it hours before his ceremony might have some unprocessed feelings? Whyever wouldn\u2019t he interrupt his honeymoon to discuss these feelings with her? \n\nYTA op. I invited an ex to my wedding and only realized what a mistake it was during the wedding weekend. We don\u2019t talk anymore. If you\u2019d like to keep any kind of a friendship with Andrew, you need better boundaries.", "Absolutely.  Who does that?", "My very, VERY much loved pet of 12 years passed away on the morning of my father's wedding. So I went ahead and told a close family member who wasn't attending the wedding and didn't say a single word to my dad or his wife until several days later. I put on a smile because the day was about them, not about me. I would never in a million years have thought to burden my dad with this and connect the day of his wedding with a day of pain and loss for his daughter. It would have been incredibly tactless and selfish - much like what OP did. Grown adults can control their feelings and can choose the appropriate time and place to share them with people, and sharing an upsetting nightmare and breaking down crying with the groom on his wedding day is only excusable if you're the bride.", "She had a very, very upsetting nightmare (night terror?) several days before the wedding. While I absolutely believe that that nightmare sent OP on an emotional rollercoaster that probably unearthed a lot of painful stuff, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to expect her to hold herself back from sobbing and breaking down to her friend on his wedding day.\n\nIf these nightmares are genuinely so deeply traumatic that days later she is still so visibly distraught to the point her friends are noticing and she is completely unable to get through an hours-long event without breaking down, then she needs to seek out (more) professional help instead of leaning on her friend for emotional support on his wedding day.", "I've also done all three. If you have something going on in your life, you find somewhere else to dump it than the bride or groom. Presumably she had other friends at this close friend's wedding she could have done this with.", "\u201cI\u2019m fine, it\u2019s not a big deal and this isn\u2019t the time. [change of subject goes here.]\u201d If you really don\u2019t want to talk about it people will respect that. I wouldn\u2019t straight up lie, but if you acknowledge something is wrong but are clear *you* don\u2019t want to discuss it now (not in a \u201coh I can\u2019t possibly bother you with this now\u201d way but in a \u201cI\u2019m absolutely not willing to discuss this right now\u201d manner), people will let you move on.", "Seriously!\n\nA wedding shouldn't be \"the most important day of your life\" but it should be full of joy and laughter and love. Even if a couple elects to make a tribute to a lost loved one it's still not an invitation for guests to unload their grief on the couple.\n\n\"That was a lovely tribute, your mom would have been so happy for you\" = totally acceptable\n\n\"That was a lovely tribute, every day I still struggle to accept that your mom is gone and I'm really can't handle the grief. My nightmares are endless and I should have died instead of her\" = not acceptable\n\nI don't get what's so hard about \"don't be a downer on someone's wedding day\" lol", "Yeah, I'm not trying to say OP is a monster or anything but they definitely handled the situation poorly. This is something that we would refer to as a setback if it happened in treatment and would be a great topic for a session to break down how/why it occurred and look for alternatives in our coping skills that can help.\n\nWhen OP woke up after the nightmare they were having what we call a normal response to an abnormal circumstance. The difficulty processing this is normal and happens to even people without a historical trauma as you mentioned. The part where it veers into diagnostic territory is that she was still impacted DAYS later by what OP knew to be an imaginary stressor that could not harm her.", "My best friend messaged me on my honeymoon asking if she overreacted to a situation. Her text however, started with \"DO NOT RESPOND UNTIL MM/DD. I know you're on your honeymoon and won't see this until afterwards, but wanted to ask if I overreacted while everything was still fresh.\" She also knew that I had no cell signal and no way to respond, but I still appreciated the disclaimer at the start \ud83e\udd23", "Yeah I don\u2019t think she should have texted him, but in my opinion if one of my friends or family texted me while I was there, I wouldn\u2019t be mad at them I just wouldn\u2019t reply. I likely wouldn\u2019t even notice since I wouldn\u2019t be using my phone much lol.", "He didn\u2019t even know what her problem was.  The accident happened years ago and it was only a few days prior to the wedding she had a nightmare that reopened up her trauma.  Unless if OP generally has a very depressing demeanour since the accident or she talked to him about her nightmare prior to wedding then I can see why Andrew was blindsided why she was struggling emotionally on the day of his wedding. \n\nAnd considering society constantly promotes wedding days as a day that should be completely focused on the happy couple, I wouldn\u2019t blame Andrew for thinking OP was upset because she knew something that may impact him, his marriage, or his wedding.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t.  It was solely about her.  What OP feels is no doubly difficult.  And if she was truly cared about Andrew, she should\u2019ve excused herself rather than expect him to comfort her on what should\u2019ve been one of the happiest day of his life.", "I agree, don't ask if you aren't ready for the truthful answer", "Because she literally said that she burst into tears because they were alone. It's the sentence I partially quoted.", "I mean, sometimes a white lie is a good thing to do, especially on a very important day for someone else.", ">It's bizarre to me that she felt it was appropriate to tell the groom she had a dream about him a few days ago where he was hurt/killed by a drunk driver and then instead of even letting him digest that, segue into Terry and then her grief and trauma.\n\nBoy, did I miss this! I thought she had a nightmare about the actual accident with Terry! I still would have voted YTA, but this adds another layer. \n\nWho wants to hear, \"oh, yeah, I dreamt you died in a horrible accident the other night. <sob> But hey, mazel tov!\" ever, let alone at their wedding?!?", "Yeah that's what I thought too but idk I can't make a concrete decision as to whether she actually does or not. \n\nLike maybe she doesn't but if she does then I wouldn't be surprised.", "Everyone can be the asshole when you\u2019re willing to just fabricate a backstory whole cloth.", "Also, even if she needed emotional support, asking the groom for it was inappropriate. She could have leaned on literally anyone else.\n\nThis is like the circle of support. The wedding couple is at the center, you don't burden them with anything else. You can burden the people who are at your level or further out.", "I also don't understand how or why she unloaded on Andrew instead of literally anyone else at this event. Is it because her dream was about *him*? If anything maybe you should keep your nightmare about your friend dying in a gruesome hit and run from him on one of the happiest days of his life?? \n\n\nI can't imagine going up to my best friend who's all happy, living her life and telling her I just dreamt someone fucking killed her, and not only that, starts talking about *my* trauma instead of the horror I just put in her head.", "Why is it not unreasonable to expect that? Everyone has worrying or upsetting things in their lives. No need unload that shit on someone\u2019s wedding day.", "I'm saying she handled it well. Yes, just the mention of survivor's guilt indicates the need for therapy, but we don't have to pathologize or diminish her rather capable handling of her response. Any therapist worth their degree would be fine with how she handled it. She's young, post-traumatic symptoms often take years to arise. This is not a setback. It reads like the onset of a symptom. Those are two very different things. \n\nAlso, the point about the imaginary stressors seems unnecessary. A shot of adrenaline is not imaginary. She's not confused about when the accident happened and she's not responding to a hallucination, she is responding to a very real physiological response.", "I don't think that alone would've made me think she was an A hole.  I think that combined with what she did at the wedding makes it not look great.", "*She was going out of her way to not cause a scene* because she felt safe because they were alone\n\nAllowing yourself to show emotions you have when you think you\u2019re safe to do so isn\u2019t self-centered or manipulative, it\u2019s just allowing yourself to be vulnerable", "Yes, of course, but sometimes big events trigger intense emotions and memories and physiology takes over - because it's not healthy to stuff our emotions in and struggle alone.", "Where did I call her self-centered or manipulative? But that didn't make it an appropriate time or place to allow herself to be vulnerable.", "No one is saying she needed to struggle alone.  But that doesn't mean he was the appropriate person at that moment either."]}
