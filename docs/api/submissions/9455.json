Of course, it was a happy, festive time for everybody involved. However, a few years ago, I and another close friend, Terry, got in a driving accident (the other driver was drunk). I survived, but after a few days, Terry passed away. I've never let quite let it go.

I told him that the night my nightmare was the worst night of my life. Andrew hugged me at first, but then he told me that his wedding was \"his day\" and made me promise not to cry and \"make a scene\" (his own words) during the actual wedding. So I promised him. During the wedding, I saw Andrew glaring at me several times, as if he was checking to see that I was acting proper.\n\nA few days after Andrew's wedding, while he was on his honeymoon, I messaged him, asking him how he was doing. He told me he was doing alright, except he wished I hadn't broken down in front of him the way I did.

I don't think you did this out of malice, nor do I think you're a bad person for telling your longtime friend about your feelings and trauma. Also, from the sound of things, you were perfectly cordial during the ceremony itself and did not \"make a scene.\" All of that said, other commenters are right when they say that that day was not an appropriate day for you to have that conversation with Andrew. There is a time and a place, and the time and place is not on the day of the wedding of one of your longest friends. \n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would let Andrew know (preferably in person) that you are sorry for dampening his mood on his wedding day, and that while it wasn't your intent, you can understand why he is upset. I would also highly, highly recommend that you seek out a well-qualified and compassionate therapist if you don't have one already.

YTA", "YTA. The dude was about to get married and was clearly going through his own thing. This was a terrible time to essentially trauma-dump on the poor guy.", "Soft YTA. You don't choose someone's wedding day to pour your heart out to them. It's already a highly emotional day for them. That being said I am sorry for what happened to you.", "YTA. I'm sorry for your loss, but you should have been composed enough at Andrew's wedding that he wouldn't have asked you what was wrong, and if you couldn't manage that, your answer should have been, \"Sorry, focus on your wedding today.\"  \n\n\nVery soft YTA, though, since he did ask.", "Sorry, but YTA. Hours before his wedding is not the time for you to have a breakdown and emotionally vomit all over Andrew.

You do know that you are only the main character of your own life, right?\n\nLeave this man alone and let him enjoy what should have been a joyful time.", "YTA absolutely, this wasn\u2019t appropriate to lay on him before his wedding. What you did is called trauma dumping and you need to ask people if it\u2019s ok before you lay heavy shit on them and before their wedding mate? Hell no. You need a therapist for this, not the Fkn groom.", "YTA - I feel bad saying that, because it sounds like you've got some form of PTSD from the accident, but you didn't need to tell him or do/say anything to detract from his day.\n\nPlease seek out counseling to help you deal with the trauma surrounding the accident.", "Soft YTA. It's his wedding day, the man has a lot on his mind and you just dumped your trauma purse all over his lap. Was this a friend of his as well?

A quick \"Oh, it's nothing, I'll be okay. So excited for you today!\" was what you needed to do here. \n\nI also sincerely recommend you seek therapy for this accident. It sounds horrific and tragic and all of those things, but it sounds in many ways like you're still frozen at that point in time, especially if a dream can essentially bring you back to the tragedy a few days after you've had it as this one seems to have done. Therapy would be an invaluable tool in helping you move forward.", "YTA. Time and a place. The time to suck up emotional labor from him was not when he was about to get married, and likely feeling extremely emotional and nervous himself. Main Character Syndrome here.", "Soft YTA, Andrew probably didn\u2019t think when he asked you what was wrong that you would have something so majorly emotional to talk about. I think you should be unloading this in therapy not just hours before his wedding. I also feel like you should have waited to ask him about it until after his honeymoon. All that being said I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going through a very hard time and didn\u2019t intentionally ruin his day.", "YTA. If it had been your wedding how would you feel?

It would have been totally fine to talk to a friend not involved with the wedding, but the groom? There was nothing he could have done for you that another close friend or loved one couldn't have.  As others have said, it sounds like you have PTSD and could use some time with a therapist. They can teach you how to separate the overwhelming emotions from the memory of the event to help you move forward in processing your grief.", "YTA\n\nYou could've talked to him about it another time and you chose a time when he's supposed to be thinking about is life with the woman he's married, not about your nightmare.", "YTA you need therapy. You could have said anything else. But you didn't. You decided to dump your verbal diarrhea on Andrew on what was meant to be the happiest day of his life. Instead you made it about you and your fears.", "Why the hell would you trauma dump on Andrew ON HIS WEDDING DAY? About someone he also knew and loved?? Seriously! You did ruin his day and the mood.

Now go get yourself into therapy and send your friend an apology letter and small, tasteful gift basket.", "Yep YTA get some therapy. If a nightmare days before an event caused you to wail, then have an impromptu outpouring you are not remotely over it. You shouldn't have gone. You could have apologized, said you had a very rough go of it and bail.

Healing is important", "YTA.\n\nYou are traumatized no doubt but that didn't give you the right to dump your trauma on your friend on his wedding day.

That doesn\u2019t mean you unleash all your trauma on him right then.", "Time and place for everything. No way he could have know it was going to be a trauma dump.", "No, we wanted her to act like an adult, and not trauma dump the groom on his wedding day", "She didn't have to lie, but she didn't have to burst into tears and pour her heart out to him either. Unless she literally couldn't help it (and 'We were both alone together, so I\" doesn't make it sound like the case), then she could have left it at, \"I had a terrible nightmare about Terry a few days ago, and just haven't been able to completely shake it yet.\"", "I mean, just because I ask someone if they are ok, doesn't mean that is the right time to go into a whole traumatic story. \n\nSay your stomach doesn't feel well or something and move on.", "Sounds to me like she just broke down. Not sure how much control she had over it.", "Especially feelings from a few years ago. She\u2019s had literally hundreds maybe even thousands of days to do this but chose the morning of his wedding. \n\nI would be annoyed too like I love you and we can have this conversation but the morning of my wedding is not an appropriate time.", "It doesn\u2019t sound like it was in OP\u2019s control though. They were holding it together until asked directly. There is a real phenomenon of being able to hold it together until asked - that\u2019s why people can break down when asked \u201care you okay?\u201d and why parents are told when toddlers trip and scrape their arm to wait to see if they\u2019re hurt rather than run up to them and make a fuss. People are pretty good at holding things in but apply a needle to a water balloon and it will burst. \n\nGroom had no idea what he was asking - he\u2019s NTA\n\nOP had a hard time holding it in when directly addressed - also NTA \n\nIdk why everyone is assuming OP is being dramatic on purpose. That sounds like some really heavy trauma.", "He knew she was upset, so he asked. He offered her some comfort then pulled an *odd* flex. All he had to do was say something along the lines of, \"I'm sorry you're going through this, I'm not at my best today either. If you're having a rough time, there's always a quiet little nook to be found. Be kind to yourself. Do you mind if we talk more about this after the wedding/honeymoon?\" It's not that hard.", "What a bad friend groom is if \u201care you okay?\u201d actually meant \u201cplease lie to me because I know you are not okay but I don\u2019t want to know about it even though I\u2019m directly asking.\u201d \n\nOP was holding to social etiquette until she thought groom was taking away those barriers to genuinely check in. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s fault she didn\u2019t know the check in wasn\u2019t genuine.", "Why are we assuming she could control her crying? She\u2019s been through serious trauma ffs", "Ah so yes, she should have lied. Got it."]}
