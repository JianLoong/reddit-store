Child support is for the child of the parent paying the support, not for someone else's child. You aren't spending the money on your son, so what are you doing with it? Have you set up a trust fund or savings account? What, besides paying for someone else's child, is that money being spent on?\n\n2.) Your ex has every right to be angry. You did not tell him you weren't using that money and consult him on doing something like setting up a trust for your son's future (whether he likes it or not, he is going to have a future, and if he's dumb enough to think child support lasts until the child is 30, he's going to need all the help he can get). You also did not consult him about using said money for Hunter. You've just done what you wanted, when you wanted, acting like you're the only parent who has a say. \n\n3.) You have a son who seems to think that he'll be able to rely on everyone else footing his bills until he's at least 30. He cannot understand what child support is (hint: it's for a CHILD, which a 30 year old is not). Do you think that is going to make him a productive adult? He is, legally speaking, 2 years away from being an adult, and you don't seem to have prepared him for that at all. \n\nETA: 4.) The fact you're 'allowing your son to date Hunter', to quote Hunter's parents, does not put you on the hook for his medical bills. Depending on what happened, because he was hurt on your property, you might be liable for his medical bills, but as others pointed out, that is what homeowners insurance is for, not child support. You seriously need to consult a lawyer and a financial advisor, and you need to do it today, the lawyer to assess whether you should be paying Hunter's medical bills and if so, you need to talk to your insurance company, and you need to talk to a financial advisor about setting that support money aside for your son in a way that will benefit him. \n\nYTA.

I do believe the money (by this I mean an equivalent amount as it may not be ring-fenced) should be used for her son and from what I have seen, there is no evidence that an equivalent amount isn\u2019t being spent to maintain a warm, safe home where the son is fed and clothed. I would be surprised if this is not the case as it costs an extortionate amount to run a household and service a 16 year old boys needs. My point was more of the general sentiment that parents shouldn\u2019t receive child support if they don\u2019t need it. I believe the reason parents pay child support is because they are responsible for raising and providing for their child. I think courts usually base the amount on the non custodial parents lifestyle (based on the belief that children should be afforded a similar standard of living to their parents) rather than the custodial parents ability to service a child\u2019s basic needs. This is why millionaire pay child support to other millionaires.

I just think that it is worth considering that the money may not be ring fenced but that does not mean she is not spending an equivalent amount to provide a safe, warm home as well as food/toiletries, allowances for fun and clothing, holidays, etc. My comment here was a general one in response to the sentiment that rich custodial parents shouldn\u2019t receive child support as they \u2018don\u2019t need it\u2019.", "It would be interesting to know how much OP spends on her son and how much she receives in child support from OP that\u2019s for sure", "It's one thing if OP had their own money and was using that to pay for the medical bills, but she doesn't. Her boyfriend provides for her and her son, which is great, but that doesn't mean child support money gets to be used for whatever. If it really doesn't matter where the funds come from, why doesn't the boyfriend pay for the medical bills and the child support money be used for the son? There is definitely something being left out here that OP doesn't want to mention. OP stated in another comment that whatever accident happened occurred on their property, and the son's boyfriends parents seem to think OP is at fault and should pay the bills. So not only is the child support money not being used for the son, the OPs boyfriend isn't paying for the medical bills despite being apparently well off, and OP is potentially responsible for some negligence where a minor got hurt and is actively admitting fault for whatever happened by paying the medical bills, and is not doing so with her own money.\n\nOP is in for a world of hurt if this goes to court.", "This is exactly what I was going to say.
