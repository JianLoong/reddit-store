The bride is shocked my BF has brought someone. When my BF said he RSVPd plus 1, the bride said yes, but that had been when you were dating EX. \n\nWe walk away, and suddenly I can hear the bride panicking saying, \"we don't have the seats or the food,\" and she starts crying. I feel awful, she spend the next 2 hours crying in the corner, being consoled by her MOH that she didn't need extra stress.\n\nThe groom said it's fine but is obviously uncomfortable, so I faked a call and then came back and claimed a work emergency. Said I had to leave ASAP.\n\nI apologised to the groom and bride, who stopped crying enough to say it was lovely to meet me.\n\nI then got a taxi and a train home.\n\nWhen my boyfriend got back Monday, he asked me about the emergency, and I explained I had lied so the bride didn't have to stress about me being there, and he gets livid. \n\nHe called me an asshole and said that not only did i leave him on his own all weekend, but all his friends thought I prioritised work over the wedding and that I made a horrible impression.\n\nI thought I was helping the situation by not being there and stressing out the wedding party, I said work emergency because for a family emergency my boyfriend would have felt obligated to come with me and I wanted him to stay and enjoy the wedding.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Grammar & formatting (apologises typing on phone)", "created_utc": 1682676978, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131nk8m/aita_for_faking_a_work_emergency_to_get_out_of_a/", "score": 107, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He absolutely should have confirmed he still had a plus 1. A simple phone call would\u2019ve saved everyone the grief.\n\nTBH I would\u2019ve done the same as you given the bride was upset and knowing the stress that goes into planning a wedding, an unexpected guest throws out the seating and meals", "Strong NTA. \n\nYou were put in a ridiculously awkward position by your boyfriend, who should have checked beforehand with his friends whether he still had a plus one after his breakup. And by the bride and groom, who probably should have been on top of this too. \n\nYou told a white lie to make things easier on everyone in a really difficult situation - the bride was having a meltdown right before her wedding and it doesn\u2019t sound like anyone else was acting to resolve things. I imagine your train home wasn\u2019t cheap, either! \n\nSeems pretty harsh that your boyfriend is reacting like this, making you feel like shit about his friends\u2019 impression of you, when he should be grovelling for the situation they put you in and worrying that they\u2019ve made a bad impression on you! He sounds like an asshole.", "NTA.\n\nThis was an incredibly kind act of yours. The amount of empathy you showed the bride is really lovely. (Yes she overreacted but not at all uncommon the night before the wedding, especially after so many delays due to COVID.) \n\nYou were also a bit between a rock and a hard place - stay and the bride is having a meltdown or leave and not be there for your boyfriend. You made a very reasonable and decent decision at the time given they were his friends. \n\nThe only thing I\u2019m confused about is why you didn\u2019t tell your BF at the time what you were doing?", "It sounds like you did this out of kindness, to the couple. \n\nI get your bf doesn't like to be lied to, maybe you could have told him what was up. But why is he so upset you left? You left him alone? The friends were upset you prioritized your work over a wedding of 2 people you'd just met? What now? \n\nYou'd never have done it if they hadn't gone into a tailspin of worry over your presence. I'm going with **NTA.** You were trying to do the right thing.", "NTA. For him to be \u2018livid\u2019 that you alleviated his great friends distress at their wedding speaks volumes\u2026so does the fact that he apparently seemed to have not told them of your existence, otherwise they may have inferred you\u2019d be there with him.  Did he not tell them he\u2019s seriously dating someone for eight months now?   Had he NEVER mentioned \u2018WE are looking forward to coming and OP is looking forward to meeting everyone\u2019.  Yet you\u2019re so integral to his life he was MAD you left a place you knew no one and he knew lots of people?\n\nThink less about this one event, and more about the ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP", "NTA. You're a saint.\n\nHis friends had no idea what kind of work emergency it was. I wonder if they even cared and it was just your BF  that projected. \n\nYou did a small bad thing to help the bride. If he had 't started name calling, I would say you could apologize for lying to him.", "NTA\n\nEveryone else over-reacted absurdly, especially the bride and your BF.  The bride's MULTI HOUR meltdown? Just how fucking fragile is she?  What the fuck did your BF want you to do? You were in a no-win situation. Stay and stress the bride. Go and he's pissed that he's \"alone\". Make up an excuse and he shits on you. If you'd said\n\"OK bride I'll bail to save you stress, love ya, good luck\" he's STILL have played the \"me so lonely' card. And how come your BF didn't think to clear this with bride beforehand?\n\nHe and his friends  are all unreasonable assholes. Your BF is not supportive at all. He's a bad BF. You can find a  better BF. Do that.", "NTA you clearly did an act of kindness, trying to reduce the stress of the bride. \n\nHowever, what the hell happened in the bride and groom's heads ?? \"Oh yeah BF has a +1 it's fine don't worry we take care of this... \\*day of the wedding\\* Wait you ACTUALLY have a +1 like you said you would ?! WTF ?!\"", "NTA. Miscommunication is unfortunate, but not your fault. Really, your bf and the groom should have clarified that months ago.\n\nBride having that level of a meltdown (over something they messed up themselves) is mental to me. But weddings can be incredibly stressful events, so it is what it is.\n\nIf I was in that same situation. You would've had to shackle me to the walls to stop me from leaving. The awkwardness and embarrassment would have just made me nope right outta there.\n\nIf you had stayed, you'd be blamed for \"ruining\" the brides perfect wedding. The fact that you did literally nothing wrong wouldn't have mattered.\n\nI think you came up with a reasonable lie to \"fix\" the situation. Could you have told your bf about it first? Maybe, it depends on how you think he would react. Considering how he lost the plot when he got home, I'd argue that you made the right choice as he would have just made things worse.\n\nYour bf wasn't so concerned about what impression you would make when he neglected to inform his friend that he was still bringing a plus 1. If his friends are judging you poorly over this then they either are ignorant of the full context of the situation. Or are just overly judgemental people.\n\nI do not like that your bf is putting this all on you when the fault lies squarely at his door.", "NTA, frankly I think this is all on the bride and groom. BF RSVPd a plus 1, not specifically his girlfriend at the time. Lots of people get plus ones without being in a specific long relationship, I think it\u2019s completely fair to assume he still had a plus 1 considering they never sent out new invites to indicate either way. Also crying for two hours over this is way too much.\n\n\nI think you could have brought it up to your boyfriend that you were gonna do this, then when talking to his friends he could be honest and make you look really thoughtful instead of looking like someone who prioritized work, but I don\u2019t think you are an asshole for it.", "NTA. You were just trying to help. While there is better ways of doing this, e.g. \"it's okay, if there isn't room for me we can celebrate together another time\" or something, your intentions were pure towards them. I can definitely understand how having your partner leave you foe the weekend for a lie would be upsetting though.", "Either your boyfriend is playing dumb or he's a few cards short of a full deck. \n\nIf you heard everything and saw the crying, so did he. It was on him to confirm his new +1 after three years and a new relationship, and once you ended up in a horrible position he did nothing about it. NTA", "NTA ... Wow people are torn over this.\n\nYOU DID A GOOD THING! You let everyone save face. Boyfriends ignorance no longer causes a huge issue for his friends wedding. Bride and groom don't have to weigh up the social cost of turning you away vs tje financial cost of last minute changes with the caterer and coordinator.\n\nThe bad first impression was inevitable because your boyfriend is an idiot. A gf of 2 years and a gf of 8 months are 2 very different things when sending invites.\n\nHe's an AH for going off at you. He could fix this very easily by telling his friends that you realised your attendance was causing the bride stress so you faked the emergency to leave without making her feel bad.", "NTA u need a new bf and he need new friends... and to cry for over 2 hours geesh...", "**NTA**, you were just being considerate and sorry to say, but your boyfriend is overreacting. He should've been thankful to you for being so selfless and thinking about his friend's wife, rather than yourself. Also, in no way would this have made an awful impression, because you weren't causing any harm. You just took a hint (from the rude bride might I add) and left. People saying you should've talked to your boyfriend, can't understand the he'd obviously say no. Maybe you should talk to your boyfriend about this because frankly, he seems like the AH.", "Bride is TA. BF checked plus one, and she didn't think to check in with him when she rescheduled. BF did everything right and bride didn't. You made the best choice you could given the circumstance you were in.", "I think it's pretty generous of you to be honest.. defo nta.. your boyfriend on the other hand...", "This is so weird, why would this leave a bad impression? Yes obviously you'd prioritise your job over the wedding of 2 strangers who can't even accommodate you!\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing.  You never wanted to stress the bride out, and clearly she was.  I bet the next time you meet she will be grateful for what you did.\n\nYou BF is the AH for not contacting the couple, but also saying that you made it seem to others that you were prioritizing work.  Maybe they didn't see the bride  crying?  \n\nI think you were a classs act, the way you handled. it.", "NTA: you were clearly unwelcome and your presence brought added stress to a drama queen bride. I wouldn't have even made up an excuse.", "INFO: I understand you were just trying to help but why wouldn\u2019t you think to communicate this little plan with your partner? Maybe he would have seen your side and you could have come up with a different story together, one that involve leaving him stranded alone an entire weekend when he obviously wanted you there?", ">He called me an asshole and said that not only did i leave him on his own all weekend, but all his friends thought I prioritised work over the wedding and that I made a horrible impression.\n\nHe was \"alone\" with his friends. He didn't check he still has the plus one. No one else saw the bride crying and asked what was going on? You should prioritize work over a wedding for people you don't know. You've been dating for less than a year. \n\nNTA. This is entirely his fault.", "YTA. \n\nLife isn't a poorly written sitcom. \n\nYou had every opportunity to discuss this with your boyfriend before faking your emergency phone call.\n\nI also find it nearly impossible that a bride is going to cry for two hours because an extra plus one showed up.", "I wish there was an \"You All Acted Dumb\" judgement because the only reason there's a conflict here is because nobody involved could be bothered to talk to anyone else involved about their assumptions.", "I think he cheated on you at the wedding.\nHence the ridiculous attempt to blame you for something he should have been thanking you for.\nNow hes trying to find a way to think of himself as the good guy.\nWhat an asshole.", "YTA - the bride sounds awful and shouldn\u2019t have said those things.  But for you to leave your boyfriend stranded/make a unilateral decision without speaking to him is not right.  Maybe your ultimate decision still would have been ok, not including him in the decision-making process was the issue.  It sounds like you two might have some communication issues to with through.", "What is this mess?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The bride was overreacting, but one of them - the couple or your bf - should have confirmed that he was still bringing a plus one.

He has been dating OP for 8 months, not 8 days. \n\nNta and I would have said that about op's boyfriend until he freaked out over the real reason of the \"work emergency \". She did a kind thing and deserved praise not grief.", "Seriously. The bride was over-reacting, but the BF was a huge asshole to the bride, and especially to OP.", "Seems like her boyfriend is prioritising *his* hurt feelings over the person whose wedding it actually was. What a winner. /s", "Yeah, the invites management was alla over the map.", "This perplexed me. He was invited +1. He turned up +1. I don\u2019t see the issue. But, not my circus, not my monkeys.", "And the groom - they were responsible for their own wedding and confirming the numbers.", "That's one helluva leap, even for this sub.\n\nFunny though", "Sorry if the formatting is terrible, I'm typing on my phone!", "Yeah I agree she was over reacting for 2 hours of crying and being comforted but a sudden unexpected guest obviously affected the plans and might\u2019ve been the final straw for her in the stressful wedding planning.", "As someone who is trying to plan a wedding, it is really stressful, she may have overreacted but I can understand the brides response", "I guess the problem was that they planned things and THEN the break up happened, and the groom and bride suddenly assumed he will go alone and they had a +1 space so they filled it with somebody else... THEN the bf arrived with op and they are now one short.", "Thank you, I edited it to be both. The bride and groom are equally responsible for not confirming the guest list. (Although brides sucks a little extra for the two hour freak out in my opinion)", "Your formatting is fine. Don't worry about that. Why are you with a person who doesn't respect you after 8 months to at least mention you to the bride and groom?", "Yes, not an uncommon thing the night before a wedding, especially if the planning process has already been stressful (which it sounds like it was with multiple delays). It\u2019s usually not a big deal what happens but rather the final straw and all the emotion about everything comes flooding out.", ">  final straw\n\nyeah that was how I also described it in another comment!", "Oh yes,  a kind of \"last straw\" moment. Even so. Two hours. She needed to have some perspective \u2014 end of the day it's only a party.", "But then that means they \u201cassumed\u201d he\u2019d go sans a +1, rather than actually *asking* him. \n\nI get the wedding was rescheduled etc, but even though you\u2019re not sending out invites again (expensive to do so), surely you\u2019d ask via text or email, to confirm numbers? \n\nI\u2019m not saying bride/groom are shitty for this, just that it seems to have stemmed from a lack of communication. It *could* have been avoided with a text. And though wedding planning takes time, a text takes about 30 seconds to send.", "They knew about me, it basically seems like an admin issue over time, the original RSVP was with his ex, it gets postponed and as they're planning the wedding again, my BF & his EX have broken up so his plus 1, unbeknownst to him is deleted/removed from the list, as they assume he hasn't got someone and then when the new date comes, I'm dating him and he assumes he's still got the plus 1 he originally RSVP'd with.", "As much as I get your perspective, to the bride this has been years in the making, a lot of plan changes, probably a lot of extra costs, it probably just tipped her over the edge. It\u2019s probably had hardly anything to do with OP\u2019s appearance, it is probably down to stress and wanting it to go perfect.", "You were put in a difficult position through no fault of your own & called an audible that saved the day for the eggshell bride. The lack of communication/confirmation falls squarely on your BF & the wedding planner. You are most definitely NTA but if I were you, I doubt I would want anything to do with such a fragile & dramatic individual as the bride. Your BF demonstrated quite clearly that he prioritizes his own comfort over yours with his reaction to being \"alone\" all weekend. He was surrounded by friends. Were you?", "Oh. Couldn't that have solved with a text or a phone call?", "Oh yes, almost certainly. I do however think it is absurd to allow a wedding to become so all-consuming.", "Not when the realization happens at the event. It was a missed communication/ assumptions made both sides that came to light only when they got to the wedding - too late for a text or a phone call then.", "I think it\u2019s a personal thing and what it means to the individual, you\u2019re entitled to your way of thinking just as much as the bride is to hers, if someone showed up to my wedding I wasn\u2019t expecting to attend I\u2019d be stressed too and it would kill my mood because I couldn\u2019t facilitate for them, whereas my partner would probably have a calmer approach. Particularly if it\u2019s a sit down meal, where is the extra plate coming from, extra seats need to be added. \n\nI think OP did the nice and thoughtful thing to remove the stress from the bride", "I was talking about the boyfriend. Shouldn't he have checked in with his \"good friends\" to let them know he'd be bringing someone else? Why didn't they know he'd split up with his ex and been with someone else for 8 months? Good friends? My eye.", "That's why I said assumptions both sides.  he assumed that because he'd already RSVPd with a plus 1, so he wouldnt have to check. Should he have checked?  probably, but it didn't occur to him because he had already responded.  The married couple knew he had broken up with his girlfriend of the time, so assumed he wasn't bringing a plus one. From what OP said, they knew he was dating the new person, so they could have also sent a text that said hey, are you bringing new girlfriend to the wedding. Or even hey, we haven't met new Gf, so would rather not have her at our special day."]}
