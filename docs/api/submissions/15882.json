The bride is shocked my BF has brought someone. When my BF said he RSVPd plus 1, the bride said yes, but that had been when you were dating EX. \n\nWe walk away, and suddenly I can hear the bride panicking saying, \"we don't have the seats or the food,\" and she starts crying. I feel awful, she spend the next 2 hours crying in the corner, being consoled by her MOH that she didn't need extra stress.\n\nThe groom said it's fine but is obviously uncomfortable, so I faked a call and then came back and claimed a work emergency. Said I had to leave ASAP.\n\nI apologised to the groom and bride, who stopped crying enough to say it was lovely to meet me.\n\nI then got a taxi and a train home.\n\nWhen my boyfriend got back Monday, he asked me about the emergency, and I explained I had lied so the bride didn't have to stress about me being there, and he gets livid. \n\nHe called me an asshole and said that not only did i leave him on his own all weekend, but all his friends thought I prioritised work over the wedding and that I made a horrible impression.\n\nI thought I was helping the situation by not being there and stressing out the wedding party, I said work emergency because for a family emergency my boyfriend would have felt obligated to come with me and I wanted him to stay and enjoy the wedding.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Grammar & formatting (apologises typing on phone)", "created_utc": 1682676978, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131nk8m/aita_for_faking_a_work_emergency_to_get_out_of_a/", "score": 850, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He absolutely should have confirmed he still had a plus 1. A simple phone call would\u2019ve saved everyone the grief.\n\nTBH I would\u2019ve done the same as you given the bride was upset and knowing the stress that goes into planning a wedding, an unexpected guest throws out the seating and meals", "Strong NTA. \n\nYou were put in a ridiculously awkward position by your boyfriend, who should have checked beforehand with his friends whether he still had a plus one after his breakup. And by the bride and groom, who probably should have been on top of this too. \n\nYou told a white lie to make things easier on everyone in a really difficult situation - the bride was having a meltdown right before her wedding and it doesn\u2019t sound like anyone else was acting to resolve things. I imagine your train home wasn\u2019t cheap, either! \n\nSeems pretty harsh that your boyfriend is reacting like this, making you feel like shit about his friends\u2019 impression of you, when he should be grovelling for the situation they put you in and worrying that they\u2019ve made a bad impression on you! He sounds like an asshole.", "NTA.\n\nThis was an incredibly kind act of yours. The amount of empathy you showed the bride is really lovely. (Yes she overreacted but not at all uncommon the night before the wedding, especially after so many delays due to COVID.) \n\nYou were also a bit between a rock and a hard place - stay and the bride is having a meltdown or leave and not be there for your boyfriend. You made a very reasonable and decent decision at the time given they were his friends. \n\nThe only thing I\u2019m confused about is why you didn\u2019t tell your BF at the time what you were doing?", "It sounds like you did this out of kindness, to the couple. \n\nI get your bf doesn't like to be lied to, maybe you could have told him what was up. But why is he so upset you left? You left him alone? The friends were upset you prioritized your work over a wedding of 2 people you'd just met? What now? \n\nYou'd never have done it if they hadn't gone into a tailspin of worry over your presence. I'm going with **NTA.** You were trying to do the right thing.", "NTA. For him to be \u2018livid\u2019 that you alleviated his great friends distress at their wedding speaks volumes\u2026so does the fact that he apparently seemed to have not told them of your existence, otherwise they may have inferred you\u2019d be there with him.  Did he not tell them he\u2019s seriously dating someone for eight months now?   Had he NEVER mentioned \u2018WE are looking forward to coming and OP is looking forward to meeting everyone\u2019.  Yet you\u2019re so integral to his life he was MAD you left a place you knew no one and he knew lots of people?\n\nThink less about this one event, and more about the ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP", "NTA. You're a saint.\n\nHis friends had no idea what kind of work emergency it was. I wonder if they even cared and it was just your BF  that projected. \n\nYou did a small bad thing to help the bride. If he had 't started name calling, I would say you could apologize for lying to him.", "NTA\n\nEveryone else over-reacted absurdly, especially the bride and your BF.  The bride's MULTI HOUR meltdown? Just how fucking fragile is she?  What the fuck did your BF want you to do? You were in a no-win situation. Stay and stress the bride. Go and he's pissed that he's \"alone\". Make up an excuse and he shits on you. If you'd said\n\"OK bride I'll bail to save you stress, love ya, good luck\" he's STILL have played the \"me so lonely' card. And how come your BF didn't think to clear this with bride beforehand?\n\nHe and his friends  are all unreasonable assholes. Your BF is not supportive at all. He's a bad BF. You can find a  better BF. Do that.", "NTA you clearly did an act of kindness, trying to reduce the stress of the bride. \n\nHowever, what the hell happened in the bride and groom's heads ?? \"Oh yeah BF has a +1 it's fine don't worry we take care of this... \\*day of the wedding\\* Wait you ACTUALLY have a +1 like you said you would ?! WTF ?!\"", "NTA. Miscommunication is unfortunate, but not your fault. Really, your bf and the groom should have clarified that months ago.\n\nBride having that level of a meltdown (over something they messed up themselves) is mental to me. But weddings can be incredibly stressful events, so it is what it is.\n\nIf I was in that same situation. You would've had to shackle me to the walls to stop me from leaving. The awkwardness and embarrassment would have just made me nope right outta there.\n\nIf you had stayed, you'd be blamed for \"ruining\" the brides perfect wedding. The fact that you did literally nothing wrong wouldn't have mattered.\n\nI think you came up with a reasonable lie to \"fix\" the situation. Could you have told your bf about it first? Maybe, it depends on how you think he would react. Considering how he lost the plot when he got home, I'd argue that you made the right choice as he would have just made things worse.\n\nYour bf wasn't so concerned about what impression you would make when he neglected to inform his friend that he was still bringing a plus 1. If his friends are judging you poorly over this then they either are ignorant of the full context of the situation. Or are just overly judgemental people.\n\nI do not like that your bf is putting this all on you when the fault lies squarely at his door.", "NTA, frankly I think this is all on the bride and groom. BF RSVPd a plus 1, not specifically his girlfriend at the time. Lots of people get plus ones without being in a specific long relationship, I think it\u2019s completely fair to assume he still had a plus 1 considering they never sent out new invites to indicate either way. Also crying for two hours over this is way too much.\n\n\nI think you could have brought it up to your boyfriend that you were gonna do this, then when talking to his friends he could be honest and make you look really thoughtful instead of looking like someone who prioritized work, but I don\u2019t think you are an asshole for it.", "NTA. You were just trying to help. While there is better ways of doing this, e.g. \"it's okay, if there isn't room for me we can celebrate together another time\" or something, your intentions were pure towards them. I can definitely understand how having your partner leave you foe the weekend for a lie would be upsetting though.", "Either your boyfriend is playing dumb or he's a few cards short of a full deck. \n\nIf you heard everything and saw the crying, so did he. It was on him to confirm his new +1 after three years and a new relationship, and once you ended up in a horrible position he did nothing about it. NTA", "NTA ... Wow people are torn over this.\n\nYOU DID A GOOD THING! You let everyone save face. Boyfriends ignorance no longer causes a huge issue for his friends wedding. Bride and groom don't have to weigh up the social cost of turning you away vs tje financial cost of last minute changes with the caterer and coordinator.\n\nThe bad first impression was inevitable because your boyfriend is an idiot. A gf of 2 years and a gf of 8 months are 2 very different things when sending invites.\n\nHe's an AH for going off at you. He could fix this very easily by telling his friends that you realised your attendance was causing the bride stress so you faked the emergency to leave without making her feel bad.", "NTA u need a new bf and he need new friends... and to cry for over 2 hours geesh...", "**NTA**, you were just being considerate and sorry to say, but your boyfriend is overreacting. He should've been thankful to you for being so selfless and thinking about his friend's wife, rather than yourself. Also, in no way would this have made an awful impression, because you weren't causing any harm. You just took a hint (from the rude bride might I add) and left. People saying you should've talked to your boyfriend, can't understand the he'd obviously say no. Maybe you should talk to your boyfriend about this because frankly, he seems like the AH.", "Bride is TA. BF checked plus one, and she didn't think to check in with him when she rescheduled. BF did everything right and bride didn't. You made the best choice you could given the circumstance you were in.", "I think it's pretty generous of you to be honest.. defo nta.. your boyfriend on the other hand...", "This is so weird, why would this leave a bad impression? Yes obviously you'd prioritise your job over the wedding of 2 strangers who can't even accommodate you!\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing.  You never wanted to stress the bride out, and clearly she was.  I bet the next time you meet she will be grateful for what you did.\n\nYou BF is the AH for not contacting the couple, but also saying that you made it seem to others that you were prioritizing work.  Maybe they didn't see the bride  crying?  \n\nI think you were a classs act, the way you handled. it.", "NTA: you were clearly unwelcome and your presence brought added stress to a drama queen bride. I wouldn't have even made up an excuse.", "INFO: I understand you were just trying to help but why wouldn\u2019t you think to communicate this little plan with your partner? Maybe he would have seen your side and you could have come up with a different story together, one that involve leaving him stranded alone an entire weekend when he obviously wanted you there?", ">He called me an asshole and said that not only did i leave him on his own all weekend, but all his friends thought I prioritised work over the wedding and that I made a horrible impression.\n\nHe was \"alone\" with his friends. He didn't check he still has the plus one. No one else saw the bride crying and asked what was going on? You should prioritize work over a wedding for people you don't know. You've been dating for less than a year. \n\nNTA. This is entirely his fault.", "YTA. \n\nLife isn't a poorly written sitcom. \n\nYou had every opportunity to discuss this with your boyfriend before faking your emergency phone call.\n\nI also find it nearly impossible that a bride is going to cry for two hours because an extra plus one showed up.", "I wish there was an \"You All Acted Dumb\" judgement because the only reason there's a conflict here is because nobody involved could be bothered to talk to anyone else involved about their assumptions.", "I think he cheated on you at the wedding.\nHence the ridiculous attempt to blame you for something he should have been thanking you for.\nNow hes trying to find a way to think of himself as the good guy.\nWhat an asshole.", "YTA - the bride sounds awful and shouldn\u2019t have said those things.  But for you to leave your boyfriend stranded/make a unilateral decision without speaking to him is not right.  Maybe your ultimate decision still would have been ok, not including him in the decision-making process was the issue.

It\u2019s probably had hardly anything to do with OP\u2019s appearance, it is probably down to stress and wanting it to go perfect.", "You were put in a difficult position through no fault of your own & called an audible that saved the day for the eggshell bride. The lack of communication/confirmation falls squarely on your BF & the wedding planner. You are most definitely NTA but if I were you, I doubt I would want anything to do with such a fragile & dramatic individual as the bride.

And instead thinking how much it sucks to drive home for a work emergency it is me, me, ME! He sounds like a shitty bf who just thinks about himself.

Most likely I think he was complaining about what you did to them.  So yeah that would leave a bad impression, but it\u2019s his fault.  He also is an AH because he didn\u2019t communicate to the bride and groom that he had a new +1.  I would have been pissed about the situation he put you in.  You show up and the bride is like \u201cwho the hell is this!?!\u201d  That\u2019s on him.\n\nBride and groom suck because they assumed that your BF no longer had a +1 to the wedding since he was no longer with his ex.  They probably found out about the break up, and I wonder if they found out about your relationship with him?  If they had known, the right thing to do would have been to confirm with your BF.  \n\nGroom had an appropriate reaction to you being there, bride is over reacting a bit.  Catering never makes just enough for a specific guess count, and if they did then they are a bad catering company!  Or whomever was in charge of food.  \n\nYou\u2019re a soft AH cause even though the intention was good to de-escalate the situation, you should have communicated with you BF instead of making the decision yourself.  At this point, the unselfish thing to do would have been to talk to your BF and explain how you felt about what was happening.  You both could have then come to a decision.\n\nUltimately this all comes down to no communication and everyone assuming, so again ESH", "This sounds so awkward, your boyfriend messed up but he's been kind enough to blame you for it NTA", "NTA. \n\nMy mom brought her life long best friend to my wedding as her plus 1.

I had extra meals planned (just in case people I had invited but didn't RSVP were able to make it) and the seats/space available, but if I didn't I would have been even more upset. This was over a year ago.\n\nYou did the courteous thing by finding a way to gracefully bow out.

They portioned the food for the exact number of guests with no buffer?", "Exactly.  The RSVP was for him and a plus one.  The plus one is never named.  \n\nThe couple were the only ones in the wrong for taking back an invitation without informing them.  He followed the instructions he was given.", "agreed", "I am assuming if he said he RSVP'd plus one, that's what the invite said. I think it's more likely that the couple simply assumed that he won't bring his new(er) girlfriend to a wedding.", "It doesn\u2019t work like that, though!\n\nThe couple can invite John and Jane *or* they can invite John +1.\n\nThese are completely different things.  If they do it the second way, John is free to bring whomever (even someone other than Jane). If they do it the first way, he is not.  \n\nNote: only the second way is a \u201c+1.\u201d  If things went down exacty as OP and her boyfriend said, neither OP nor her bf are TA.", "> I\u2019d say that a completely different +1 than the one you were invited with does change things\n\nNo, it doesn't.  A plus one means \"we don't care who you bring\" so he could change his mind at any moment on who it was and been fine.  He could have brought a random friend.  \n\nIf they wanted a specific person with him, they needed to be specified by name on the invite.", "Then you inform that to people and don't assume that someone who had RSVPd a plus one would now arrive without one.", "Then you tell your guest that.  \n\nA plus one never expires.  He could have brought a random friend and been in the right.  \n\nPlus one is for \"bring whoever you want\".  Named invites are for specific people.  \n\nIf they wanted to take back his plus one, they needed to tell him specifically.   A relationship ending does not take away a plus one because relationships have nothing to do with a plus one.", "Exactly. I think OP did the right thing in this circumstance. It\u2019s like the boyfriend doesn\u2019t care about the bride and groom either, just *his* feelings. He says it bothered his friends that she left, but did it *really*?

One. \"Hey OP, we didn't realize you were still bringing someone and we haven't got food planned for an extra person. Think you guys could share a meal if we can't figure something else out or if there's no extras?\" And then pull up a fucking pillow to sit on if they have to.\n\nNot worth the meltdown. Even if it was the straw that broke the camel's back that's a shit thing to do in front of the person who feels at fault for it.", "Ahhhh yeah that might be it indeed! But that's a problem on their part then, not checking again if BF still had a +1. Weird way of organizing things", "Like I said, we don't know what else has gone on behind the scenes, so if this was the final straw after a whole shitload of problems for the last three-four years (since they were to be married in 2020, which means they've likely been planning since 2019), then yeah, a two hour cry session would make sense. It's not just because of OP; the bride broke down because of EVERYTHING that has gone wrong. Some people are genuinely more emotional, and OP never says if it's two hours of hardcore crying; it could have been done in waves.", "Yeah if she can\u2019t talk to him about this she has bigger problems. I agree with YTA for not clueing in the boyfriend.", "Nah. Her BF overreacted", "Yeah I get the bride's reaction and fair play to you OP for trying to come up with a solution. NTA but why didn't you check in with your bf before faking the work emergency? You could've come up with a cover story together. Fair enough if you didn't get the chance though.
