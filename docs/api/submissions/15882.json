The bride is shocked my BF has brought someone. When my BF said he RSVPd plus 1, the bride said yes, but that had been when you were dating EX. \n\nWe walk away, and suddenly I can hear the bride panicking saying, \"we don't have the seats or the food,\" and she starts crying. I feel awful, she spend the next 2 hours crying in the corner, being consoled by her MOH that she didn't need extra stress.\n\nThe groom said it's fine but is obviously uncomfortable, so I faked a call and then came back and claimed a work emergency. Said I had to leave ASAP.\n\nI apologised to the groom and bride, who stopped crying enough to say it was lovely to meet me.\n\nI then got a taxi and a train home.\n\nWhen my boyfriend got back Monday, he asked me about the emergency, and I explained I had lied so the bride didn't have to stress about me being there, and he gets livid. \n\nHe called me an asshole and said that not only did i leave him on his own all weekend, but all his friends thought I prioritised work over the wedding and that I made a horrible impression.\n\nI thought I was helping the situation by not being there and stressing out the wedding party, I said work emergency because for a family emergency my boyfriend would have felt obligated to come with me and I wanted him to stay and enjoy the wedding.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: Grammar & formatting (apologises typing on phone)", "created_utc": 1682676978, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131nk8m/aita_for_faking_a_work_emergency_to_get_out_of_a/", "score": 4854, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He absolutely should have confirmed he still had a plus 1. A simple phone call would\u2019ve saved everyone the grief.\n\nTBH I would\u2019ve done the same as you given the bride was upset and knowing the stress that goes into planning a wedding, an unexpected guest throws out the seating and meals", "Strong NTA. \n\nYou were put in a ridiculously awkward position by your boyfriend, who should have checked beforehand with his friends whether he still had a plus one after his breakup. And by the bride and groom, who probably should have been on top of this too. \n\nYou told a white lie to make things easier on everyone in a really difficult situation - the bride was having a meltdown right before her wedding and it doesn\u2019t sound like anyone else was acting to resolve things. I imagine your train home wasn\u2019t cheap, either! \n\nSeems pretty harsh that your boyfriend is reacting like this, making you feel like shit about his friends\u2019 impression of you, when he should be grovelling for the situation they put you in and worrying that they\u2019ve made a bad impression on you! He sounds like an asshole.", "NTA.\n\nThis was an incredibly kind act of yours. The amount of empathy you showed the bride is really lovely. (Yes she overreacted but not at all uncommon the night before the wedding, especially after so many delays due to COVID.) \n\nYou were also a bit between a rock and a hard place - stay and the bride is having a meltdown or leave and not be there for your boyfriend. You made a very reasonable and decent decision at the time given they were his friends. \n\nThe only thing I\u2019m confused about is why you didn\u2019t tell your BF at the time what you were doing?", "It sounds like you did this out of kindness, to the couple. \n\nI get your bf doesn't like to be lied to, maybe you could have told him what was up. But why is he so upset you left? You left him alone? The friends were upset you prioritized your work over a wedding of 2 people you'd just met? What now? \n\nYou'd never have done it if they hadn't gone into a tailspin of worry over your presence. I'm going with **NTA.** You were trying to do the right thing.", "NTA. For him to be \u2018livid\u2019 that you alleviated his great friends distress at their wedding speaks volumes\u2026so does the fact that he apparently seemed to have not told them of your existence, otherwise they may have inferred you\u2019d be there with him.  Did he not tell them he\u2019s seriously dating someone for eight months now?   Had he NEVER mentioned \u2018WE are looking forward to coming and OP is looking forward to meeting everyone\u2019.  Yet you\u2019re so integral to his life he was MAD you left a place you knew no one and he knew lots of people?\n\nThink less about this one event, and more about the ENTIRE RELATIONSHIP", "NTA. You're a saint.\n\nHis friends had no idea what kind of work emergency it was. I wonder if they even cared and it was just your BF  that projected. \n\nYou did a small bad thing to help the bride. If he had 't started name calling, I would say you could apologize for lying to him.", "NTA\n\nEveryone else over-reacted absurdly, especially the bride and your BF.  The bride's MULTI HOUR meltdown? Just how fucking fragile is she?  What the fuck did your BF want you to do? You were in a no-win situation. Stay and stress the bride. Go and he's pissed that he's \"alone\". Make up an excuse and he shits on you. If you'd said\n\"OK bride I'll bail to save you stress, love ya, good luck\" he's STILL have played the \"me so lonely' card. And how come your BF didn't think to clear this with bride beforehand?\n\nHe and his friends  are all unreasonable assholes. Your BF is not supportive at all. He's a bad BF. You can find a  better BF. Do that.", "NTA you clearly did an act of kindness, trying to reduce the stress of the bride. \n\nHowever, what the hell happened in the bride and groom's heads ?? \"Oh yeah BF has a +1 it's fine don't worry we take care of this... \\*day of the wedding\\* Wait you ACTUALLY have a +1 like you said you would ?! WTF ?!\"", "NTA. Miscommunication is unfortunate, but not your fault. Really, your bf and the groom should have clarified that months ago.\n\nBride having that level of a meltdown (over something they messed up themselves) is mental to me. But weddings can be incredibly stressful events, so it is what it is.\n\nIf I was in that same situation. You would've had to shackle me to the walls to stop me from leaving. The awkwardness and embarrassment would have just made me nope right outta there.\n\nIf you had stayed, you'd be blamed for \"ruining\" the brides perfect wedding. The fact that you did literally nothing wrong wouldn't have mattered.\n\nI think you came up with a reasonable lie to \"fix\" the situation. Could you have told your bf about it first? Maybe, it depends on how you think he would react. Considering how he lost the plot when he got home, I'd argue that you made the right choice as he would have just made things worse.\n\nYour bf wasn't so concerned about what impression you would make when he neglected to inform his friend that he was still bringing a plus 1. If his friends are judging you poorly over this then they either are ignorant of the full context of the situation. Or are just overly judgemental people.\n\nI do not like that your bf is putting this all on you when the fault lies squarely at his door.", "NTA, frankly I think this is all on the bride and groom. BF RSVPd a plus 1, not specifically his girlfriend at the time. Lots of people get plus ones without being in a specific long relationship, I think it\u2019s completely fair to assume he still had a plus 1 considering they never sent out new invites to indicate either way. Also crying for two hours over this is way too much.\n\n\nI think you could have brought it up to your boyfriend that you were gonna do this, then when talking to his friends he could be honest and make you look really thoughtful instead of looking like someone who prioritized work, but I don\u2019t think you are an asshole for it.", "NTA. You were just trying to help. While there is better ways of doing this, e.g. \"it's okay, if there isn't room for me we can celebrate together another time\" or something, your intentions were pure towards them. I can definitely understand how having your partner leave you foe the weekend for a lie would be upsetting though.", "Either your boyfriend is playing dumb or he's a few cards short of a full deck. \n\nIf you heard everything and saw the crying, so did he. It was on him to confirm his new +1 after three years and a new relationship, and once you ended up in a horrible position he did nothing about it. NTA", "NTA ... Wow people are torn over this.\n\nYOU DID A GOOD THING! You let everyone save face. Boyfriends ignorance no longer causes a huge issue for his friends wedding. Bride and groom don't have to weigh up the social cost of turning you away vs tje financial cost of last minute changes with the caterer and coordinator.\n\nThe bad first impression was inevitable because your boyfriend is an idiot. A gf of 2 years and a gf of 8 months are 2 very different things when sending invites.\n\nHe's an AH for going off at you. He could fix this very easily by telling his friends that you realised your attendance was causing the bride stress so you faked the emergency to leave without making her feel bad.", "NTA u need a new bf and he need new friends... and to cry for over 2 hours geesh...", "**NTA**, you were just being considerate and sorry to say, but your boyfriend is overreacting. He should've been thankful to you for being so selfless and thinking about his friend's wife, rather than yourself. Also, in no way would this have made an awful impression, because you weren't causing any harm. You just took a hint (from the rude bride might I add) and left. People saying you should've talked to your boyfriend, can't understand the he'd obviously say no. Maybe you should talk to your boyfriend about this because frankly, he seems like the AH.", "Bride is TA. BF checked plus one, and she didn't think to check in with him when she rescheduled. BF did everything right and bride didn't. You made the best choice you could given the circumstance you were in.", "I think it's pretty generous of you to be honest.. defo nta.. your boyfriend on the other hand...", "This is so weird, why would this leave a bad impression? Yes obviously you'd prioritise your job over the wedding of 2 strangers who can't even accommodate you!\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing.  You never wanted to stress the bride out, and clearly she was.  I bet the next time you meet she will be grateful for what you did.\n\nYou BF is the AH for not contacting the couple, but also saying that you made it seem to others that you were prioritizing work.  Maybe they didn't see the bride  crying?  \n\nI think you were a classs act, the way you handled. it.", "NTA: you were clearly unwelcome and your presence brought added stress to a drama queen bride. I wouldn't have even made up an excuse.", "INFO: I understand you were just trying to help but why wouldn\u2019t you think to communicate this little plan with your partner? Maybe he would have seen your side and you could have come up with a different story together, one that didn\u2019t involve leaving him stranded alone an entire weekend when he obviously wanted you there?", ">He called me an asshole and said that not only did i leave him on his own all weekend, but all his friends thought I prioritised work over the wedding and that I made a horrible impression.\n\nHe was \"alone\" with his friends. He didn't check he still has the plus one. No one else saw the bride crying and asked what was going on? You should prioritize work over a wedding for people you don't know. You've been dating for less than a year. \n\nNTA. This is entirely his fault.", "YTA. \n\nLife isn't a poorly written sitcom. \n\nYou had every opportunity to discuss this with your boyfriend before faking your emergency phone call.\n\nI also find it nearly impossible that a bride is going to cry for two hours because an extra plus one showed up.", "I wish there was an \"You All Acted Dumb\" judgement because the only reason there's a conflict here is because nobody involved could be bothered to talk to anyone else involved about their assumptions.", "I think he cheated on you at the wedding.\nHence the ridiculous attempt to blame you for something he should have been thanking you for.\nNow hes trying to find a way to think of himself as the good guy.\nWhat an asshole.", "YTA - the bride sounds awful and shouldn\u2019t have said those things.  But for you to leave your boyfriend stranded/make a unilateral decision without speaking to him is not right.  Maybe your ultimate decision still would have been ok, not including him in the decision-making process was the issue.

And i don't understand his \"you left him alone\" when he next talks about all his friends who thought bad about you. So he wasn't alone, he had all those friends with whom he talked shit about you! And instead thinking how much it sucks to drive home for a work emergency it is me, me, ME! He sounds like a shitty bf who just thinks about himself.

Most likely I think he was complaining about what you did to them.  So yeah that would leave a bad impression, but it\u2019s his fault.  He also is an AH because he didn\u2019t communicate to the bride and groom that he had a new +1.  I would have been pissed about the situation he put you in.  You show up and the bride is like \u201cwho the hell is this!?!\u201d  That\u2019s on him.\n\nBride and groom suck because they assumed that your BF no longer had a +1 to the wedding since he was no longer with his ex.  They probably found out about the break up, and I wonder if they found out about your relationship with him?  If they had known, the right thing to do would have been to confirm with your BF.  \n\nGroom had an appropriate reaction to you being there, bride is over reacting a bit.  Catering never makes just enough for a specific guess count, and if they did then they are a bad catering company!  Or whomever was in charge of food.  \n\nYou\u2019re a soft AH cause even though the intention was good to de-escalate the situation, you should have communicated with you BF instead of making the decision yourself.  At this point, the unselfish thing to do would have been to talk to your BF and explain how you felt about what was happening.

So it is possible the boyfriend knew he gave up the +1 and forgot and didn't do anything. But it would not be the BF's responsibility to check if the topic had not been previously discussed.\n\nSo it's likely the couple are assholes in that situation, but it could be just the BF responsible for that part.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is excessive and shitty. Maybe his friends think you are prioritizing work over a wedding of someone you don't know. But they would not have liked knowing you were leaving to settle a problem with the wedding. and for whatever reason, the problem seemed to be beyond their ability to solve. There was no good answer. Telling BF why you were leaving would have made things suck more I am guessing, given his reaction.\n\nBF certainly AH, couple likely AH.\n\nYou. This is tougher. Your intentions were good. And it's not like you made a bad decision and something horrible happened when you thought you were trying to be good. What it comes down to, is lying for a good reason asshole or not?

The groom should have double checked him in that case.

You needed to tell your BF that you were doing it for the bride BEFORE you just ditch for the entire weekend. Also, you made the call really quickly, heck you could have just said something like \"I totally understand you weren't expecting me, I have no issue with going home.

A good 90% showed up as well as \u201cuninvited\u201d people (people my husband barely knew so we left off the list because my cuts were all very personal and hard decisions to make but his parents were mad we shortened their end of the list so much but it was because he didn\u2019t know or like most of them).

All his friends judged her for \u201cprioritizing\u201d her means of financial stability over a wedding that does not have enough food for her to have a meal or a place for her to even sit at the reception, for a bride and groom she has never met and just watched freak out for two hours, all for her BF of eight months. \n\n\nBf should have seriously appreciated her gesture. NTA.", "Dang, good work.", "Yes, obviously. I\u2019m saying it makes sense if you\u2019ve decided you\u2019re not giving out random plus ones, because that\u2019s out of budget. So if your single friend never got a plus one, then your newly single friend doesn\u2019t now get to bring a rando because their ex had been invited out of courtesy.", "ESH\n\nThis was a mess, and ultimately the fault of the bride/groom.  Whatever assumptions your BF made regarding his plus one (and I do think he should have said something to the bride/groom, since usually they like all guests NAMED for the placecards), they definitely dropped the ball.  And when they realized the issue, it should have been dealt with privately.  The bride having a public breakdown, however frazzled she was, was incredibly rude.\n\nI *totally* understand where you are coming from.  I would feel *horrible* if I led to a bride having a breakdown, even though it wasn't my actual fault.  You felt unwanted, and you thought you were giving the bride an easy out.  Which you did.  You were fine missing the wedding, so why not do her a solid.\n\nThe problem, like in all these relationship posts, was communication.  You made this decision unilaterally, and did not just lie to the couple (out of politeness), you also lied to your boyfriend.  He did not want to spend a wedding weekend alone.  He wanted to introduce you to his friends.  And to them, who do not view this through the lens of you helping out the bride, you did RSVP yes to a wedding and just bailed.  You did make a horrible impression on the rest of them, in your attempts to help the bride.  Because none of them knew the truth.  Ans by the time he tells them all the truth, it gets back to the bride, who now feels like a crazy person who drove you from her wedding, and doesn't really appreciate being painted with that brush.\n\nSo all your work to do a nice thing... kind of didn't even do that nice thing.  Which could have been prevented, simply by talking with your boyfriend before lying.  Maybe he would have talked you out of the lie.  Maybe he would have made a better cover for the both of you.  Maybe he would have talked to the groom and said my bad dude, tell the bride that GF and I are cool sharing a plate and not to give it another thought or worry.  Who knows.  Because you did not COMMUNICATE.", "ESH. You did a really selfless and smart thing for the bride, but you did it unilaterally. You were your BFs plus one\u2014You should have communicated with HIM about it. Instead, you lied to him, and left him hanging and embarrassed. I\u2019d be pissed, too. \n\nTeamwork makes the dream work. You forgot you were part of Team BF, not Team Bride.\n\nHe is an AH for setting up the awkward situation and blowing up after. You all need to work on your communication.", "THANK YOU! I am so completely floored by the n t a votes. OP couldn't talk to her partner before deciding she will play the 'angel' aka the saviour and leave her partner alone at a weekend wedding when he obviously wanted you there? Why is that? \n\nYTA for not even giving your partner a chance to even give an input here.", "Agreed. They took a weekend trip together (Friday to Monday) and OP skipped the whole thing because of a single missing meal on Saturday. Just be honest with your partner and work something out.", "That explains why the BF didn't know before the phone call, but OP kept up the lie for 3 days.", "I mean, the misunderstanding is on the bride and groom for not checking the RSVPs?", "How exactly was the problem created by him? The problem was directly created by the bride & groom rescinding an extended plus one and not informing him.", "Nah, cry for 5 minutes then pivot so you can still have a wedding. Don\u2019t fucking ruin everything for everyone for two hours like a little baby. Be an adult.", "I find it hard to believe that there's not at least one ex-spouse or elderly relative that is no longer in the picture after this long a delay.", "No, *they* should have.\n\nBF is not off the hook, however, because he was also the asshole for the way he reacted.", "> It's nice to give everyone a plus one if possible, but it's not always financially feasible to accommodate this, especially for people having small, budget weddings. \n\nYou cut it smaller or you get married in the courthouse legally with a party when you can afford it.  \n\nI'm planning a very small wedding.  I know better than to be a shitty host.  \n\nEither be a good host or don't throw your party.", "Omfg I love this. Makes so much sense \n\nThe other day I had to take my youngest to have a mole removed for a biopsy. So I spent the first part of my day holding down my sobbing child while she begged us not to give her a \"shot\". Then we were supposed to do fun things as a family . Go to McDonald's, grab some ice cream at the store to make floats, etc. First kid #3 drops her nuggets. Then at the store the kids find things they want. Altogether it was all too expensive, so we pick some things for them to share. So they fuss about that. Then my husband says something to oldest that she interprets as mean(his tone). So she's crying. Then they remember I have a Starbucks gift card and they want that instead of the ice cream we bought for home. But it's late now because the doctor's office and errands took forever. So I say no, we don't have time because we need to get home and have dinner. More crying. Go home and I start getting outfits for the next day. But the clean laundry pile has been scattered and mixed with the dirty laundry  My husband offers to get the kids ready to shower while I get mine and the kids clothes for tomorrow. Which I take to mean he'll find them all clean PJs while I get clothes for tomorrow. No, he got one set of PJs for oldest and got her in the shower, and figured I would get  the rest(???).\n\nAnyways, that's how I ended up sitting in a pile of laundry and sobbing over not being able to find matching socks yesterday.", "100% yes, he should\u2019ve.", ">They probably thought it was obvious the plus one didn't apply anymore\n\nFor me that would come down to whether Boyfriend and Ex Girlfriend were invited, or if Boyfriend +1 was invited. \n\nI would expect if I invited the boyfriend and his then-girlfriend that now only the boyfriend would attend. If I invited the boyfriend with a +1 I would absolutely not think it's obvious that the +1 no longer applies.", "Shouldn't the people hosting the event and in charge of the catering/venue be responsible for making sure they issue out the RVSPs and seeing about plus ones? He assumed the RSVP was still valid from the prior attempted wedding and after the delay due to covid and the family member death the RSVP is still assumed to be the same. Either he could call to make sure the plus one is still valid but the people hosting should also have made sure the plans set in motion and hosted by them were still going along. Relationships and kids being born, and people dying, happened in the last 3 years so they should've sent some updates to ask about new plans to the guests they wanted to invite.", "NTA, you did it with positive intent to help the bride out, and you didn't really know them anyway. I get why your boyfriend would be upset having to go through the wedding alone, but you're not at fault here, the issue was the poor planning underpinning the wedding reschedule.", "Precisely. And not to be mean but in my experience dudes rarely take this kind of stuff seriously. He 100% should\u2019ve followed up with the bride to verify whether he\u2019s got a +1. I mean, it\u2019s been *three years*. A lot can change in event planning during that time.", "I think I worded things a bit poorly, saying \"doesn't apply anymore.\" I didn't mean that the bride and groom revoked it or he didn't have that option at all, but more they thought it was obvious things changed from the original plan and OP's bf would need to communicate any new plans about bringing someone and if he was still using the plus one, which he didn't do.\n\nI feel like OP's bf probably originally mentioned that he would be bringing his gf as his plus one, and then they broke up and he never talked about his plus one again. In that case it probably seemed like he wasn't using it to the bride and groom. They shouldn't have just assumed though, they should have asked.\n\nI think it was just bad communication on both ends, probably because OP and the couple aren't in close contact.", "Neither do you! You\u2019re just assuming she\u2019s going through way more than she may be.", "Well now we know why the person who was dating him is no longer involved. Maybe he was always an asshole...\n\nI'm joking, of course we don't know, but I guess he felt embarrassed, because his + 1 left and he didn't realize why. So he assumed she ditched him and felt offended. \n\nIs possible he asked what was the emergency to know how exactly shame her for it. Since he was already offended from the get go, it doesn't matter she has good reasons or not he was going to raise a stink anyway.", "Agreeeed. I also seriously doubt they where really judging her that hard if at all. Sounds like he was pissed and complaining. This sounds like a throw him in rice moment he needs to cool it.", "Idk how their venue works but mine was very very clear that anyone who was not included in the count 10 days before the wedding would not have a chair, a table setting, or a meal. I think there was also a fee we\u2019d have to pay. So she may not have been over reacting too much depending on the venue and contract she signed.", "I dunno about overreacting.  Big stress can equal big emotions.  I literally almost vomited when I learned the night before my wedding one of the groomsmen has no pants with his rented tux.  We were hours into the mountains and the tuxes had shown up that day from an online order, so there was no fixing the tux situation.  HOWEVER we were able to go buy a pair of black pants.  12 years later, it\u2019s a nothing situation, but in that moment, I was in my hotel room, standing over the toilet almost barfing because this one teeny tiny thing was about to push me over the edge.", "What bride has two hours of free time to spend crying on her wedding day?\n\nWhy was she crying in full view of the party?!", "> Seems like her boyfriend is prioritising his hurt feelings over the person whose wedding it actually was. What a winner.\n\nTo be fair.... it was the couple's fault.  \n\nThey took back a plus one without telling him.  They didn't check how the RSVPs would change with a different date.  They didn't talk to anyone.  \n\nThe BF followed instructions. \n\nWhy exactly should he claim responsibility for an issue he didn't cause?   The couple were bad hosts.\n\nHe was rude to OP when he got back.  That is his own fault, and was likely caused by everyone blaming him for issues the couple caused themselves.", "It does seem kinda weird that she wouldn't at least tell her boyfriend \"Hey this is super awkward I'm just gonna say I have a work emergency and get out of here.\" I'd be kinda annoyed too if my girlfriend bailed.", "> weddings are super stressful\n\nif you let them become this huge thing, with two hundred moving parts, and expect it to be perfect, yes :-(\n\nand yes. the bf is an arse, no discussion", "Because event planning is gd stressful. Last minute changes can feel like the world is ending. Was it appropriate? No, but we also don\u2019t know if other stuff was falling through, whether her favorite aunt bailed last minute, whether the bridesmaid spilled wine on her dress, etc etc. Her crying, while dramatic, is the least surprising thing in this entire story.", "It seems miraculous that nobody showed up without their +1, freeing up space and food. Obviously the seating plan would still be thrown off but something could've been sorted as long as there was space.", "I don\u2019t necessarily think you were in the wrong to want to help fix the issue. However, you should\u2019ve been honest with your bf. This was an opportunity to the two of you together to problem solve. I would be upset to have that choice taken from me. These were his friends, and he likely could have helped diffuse the situation and come up with a solution. He wanted you there, he was proud to have you as a partner meeting all of his friends. It would have been different if you were upfront about it to him instead of unilaterally making the decision to leave under false pretenses. \n\nI think what you did was super kind to the bride. Just not considerate to your boyfriend. \n\nThe bride messed up. She assumed. Your boyfriend did not mess up. He received an invitation with a plus one. If the bride changed the count on her end, she should have confirmed it with your boyfriend. Period. That\u2019s on her. Simple oversight? Sure. But, you adjust or rescind an invitation, it is on that person to communicate that.", "And the groom - they were responsible for their own wedding and confirming the numbers.", "If it was that important to her, she should have been extra careful to reconfirm all the RSVPs.", "Thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours, yet they couldn\u2019t take the time to reconfirm the guest list?", "I mean.... if we want to ignore information in the post and make up our own versions then fine.", "If they\u2019re his \u201cbest friends\u201d and he sees them regularly, then maybe they\u2019ll run into each other. But it\u2019s not the worst thing in the world if not all of your SO\u2019s friends like you. \n\nI can tell you for an absolute **fact** that my ex\u2019s best friend hated me. I mean, I hated him with the intensity of a thousand suns, so I really didn\u2019t care what he thought of me\u2026 he slept around a LOT, he wasn\u2019t respectful of women in general, he was a complete [bleep]  He liked me well enough to start, but then somewhere along the way, he decided to start being a [bleep] and it went downhill from there. I said to ex \u201che might be *your* best friend, but that doesn\u2019t mean he has to be mine\u201d. Also, ex hated my then-best friend too. When we saw our respective besties when we were together, we were polite and as nice as could be, because that\u2019s what you do, you suck it up. Anyway, I digress\u2026 \n\nOP\u2019s bf\u2019s friends have the option of \u201csuck it up, buttercup\u201d when around OP, or\u2026not.

I'm new.", "Well I respectfully disagree.", "> It's not snoby - it's cost saving\n\nIf you can't afford to not be rude AF to your guests, either cut the guest list down or push out the wedding.  \n\nYou can always go to the courthouse in the meantime if you need the legal marriage handled.  \n\nEither accept that everyone will think about how rude you are by treating your guests that way, or don't treat your guests that way."]}
