I know my cousin (who is a woman, I think she\u2019s 23) got married to a guy she\u2019s bred dating since high school but I\u2019ve never seen him at all.\n\nSo it was my other cousin\u2019s birthday (her sister) and I was at my aunts and uncles house for that. A lot of her friends were there so I didn\u2019t know who was who. There was a guy in the backyard with bleach blonde hair who looked around my age. He was good looking and i started talking to him. He was really shy and he seemed very nice. I said we should hang sometime and asked for his snap and he got all weird and was like \u201coh\u2026 I\u2026 uhh\u2026 I gotta go\u201d\n\nHe went over to my cousin and whispered something in her ear and she glared at me and i put the puzzle pieces together. It was her husband. \n\nShe went over to me and said \u201cso yeah\u2026uhhh, my husband is not gay. Sorry to break it to you. He\u2019s only interested in ME\u201d And power walked away.\n\nFor the rest of the day she kept trying to make me feel uncomfortable. She kept glaring at me and make sure I was looking and then make out with him. They were sitting and she looked at me and said to him \u201cI love you sooooo much. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re MY husband\u201d and then later on they were whispering and then someone made some joke about spanking and she looked at me \u201coh I\u2019ll be getting a spanking tonight alright\u201d and gave me some evil grin \n\nAll she did was make me feel like shit about myself. I didn\u2019t know he was straight, I felt bad for putting him in that spot. All she\u2019s doing is rubbing in the fact a guy I thought was cute is hers, and trying to make me jealous. If her goal was to ruin my self esteem, mission accomplished", "created_utc": 1683267847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138cwg8/aita_for_talking_to_my_cousins_husband/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also bizarre she acted so insecurely if her husband is straight.\n\nThis has actually happened before with my husband and we all had a good natured laugh about how it's an easy mistake to make because he's so pretty.

There was a more mature way for your cousin handle that. Actually there was nothing to handle. There was an awkward moment and it ended as quickly as it started.

Side note though: it's always nice to gently and discreetly find out relationship status while chatting with someone you have interest in especially for people who may be very shy/awkward.
