I would have enjoyed living with any of them, I just liked the person I chose the best. I also didn't interview people so maybe they were having an off day and I didn't give them a good chance.

You don't \"owe\" anybody a room.\n\nYou had to select someone.  You did.\n\nThat's not meant to sound harsh, it is just the reality.  You only have one room and people that responded were there to look at the room.  Just like they aren't obligated to rent from you if they look at the room, you are not obligated to rent to them because they viewed it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If it's that competitive, you were giving them a chance. Seems like they weren't 'friends' or you would not have considered interviewing them. I'm going to guess you didn't mention you were asking a lot of people. Why would anyone? Kind of dog eat dog when it comes to apartment hunting when I was doing it years ago in NYC. It's common. \n\nYou didn't interview them so you didn't 'invade' their private life. All you did was get their hopes up. Something that happens every time one goes on a job interview, has a date, circles an ad, bids on EBAY and so on. It's called life. They shouldn't be upset at you. Maybe frustrated they didn't find a place live. \n\nFWIW: The two who understood would stay on my short list if the new person backs out. If they understand your situation then odds are they'd be a better roommate than the two who got upset.", "NTA\n\nYou offered a viewing, not a lease. These people knew they were going to look at the room, and trying to make you feel bad for not choosing them is really immature.", "NAH\n\nUnless they are pretty clueless, they should have known that they probably weren't the only person that was going to be looking at the apartment.  They may be a little annoyed but it shouldn't have been some sort of shock.", "NTA you have every right to choose the roommate you want.  Offering them a viewing was in no way a guarantee they'd get the place.", "Someone is always going to be a winner and there will always be losers.  You are going to choose 1 roommate.

I based my decision on the information on their profile, and the general 'vibe' they had when they came to view the room. \n\nYou really need to be able to have candid and respectful conversations with the person you live with, and this doesn't seem like the best start or selection criteria. People can put whatever they want on their profiles, and \"vibes\" aren't going to make up for completely different lifestyles/preferences/values. Interviewing candidates to live with when there is an abundance of interest should be the bare minimum.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are fine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou HAD to \"deny\" almost all of them a home -- the only choice was which ones.", "Need more info- Were the 4 people you reached out to friends who you knew were looking for accomodation? If so, kind of a dick move to offer 4 different people a room when there's only 1 all the while setting up an ad for it, that's if these people were your friends of course.", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t expect to just be accepted as a housemate from a website - you need to meet the person first before making a decision.", "NTA- seems standard that you show them the place, see how they are then decide.

Big waste of their time showing them a room you had 100 people contact you about.", "NAH. For me it is like a job interview, you need to find a person that you think you can live with, and I would think that should be well understood by anyone applying, so unless you really worded your \u2018invite to view\u2019 wrongly you are good. They are probably frustrated with the whole renting issues and were venting when you contacted them to let them know the outcome, and I hope that you don\u2019t take their words personally, if they keep harassing you then they are going to cross into being the AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think this is just a misunderstanding.\n\nYou haven't done anything wrong or purposely misleading, but at the same time it could have been interpreted as you picking out someone you liked instead of ranting to go through the burden of having many applicants.\n\nAnd since there was no interview, the misunderstanding  hasn't been cleared.", "I think this probably makes the most sense! I think I will be clearer in future. Or maybe just reach out to people or put an ad up, but not both.", "I think just be clear on what you are \"offering\" them.
