She apparently wanted you to stay, even though she said completely the opposite.

You gave her ample opportunities to tell you she wanted you to stay. She indicated that she would be fine without you. She has no right to be upset that you did exactly what she told you to do. And in all honesty I think you have the right to go to the funeral even if she DID a want you to stay home with her (assuming she\u2019s not deathly ill) - I would\u2019ve tried to find a friend or family member to check in on her if it was necessary. I feel like sometimes people don\u2019t realize\u2026 wakes and funerals are more for the living than they are for the dead. It\u2019s nice to pay respects to the departed, but it\u2019s more important to show support to the loved ones left behind.\n\nEDIT: a typo", "NTA. She\u2019s a grown ass adult, playing childish games and expecting you to be a mind reader. \nYou literally offered to stay and she said no, so why turn the tables and play childish games?", "NTA. She's gaslighting you. She needs to learn how to communicate like an adult.", "NTA.  Ok, sick people can get cranky.  But your wife is a grown woman and can ask for what she needs.  You can\u2019t negotiate about a problem you don\u2019t know exists.  It\u2019s simplistic (and childish) to suggest you\u2019re picking your dead aunt over your wife.  You didn\u2019t miss the birth of your child or leave while she had surgery.  She could take care of herself.  You took care of yourself as well by attending the funeral\u2014you didn\u2019t demand she get off her sick bed and accompany you.

Your wife wanted you to prioritize her. Unfortunately, she lied so convincingly that you thought she was safe to be alone while you took an overnight trip for a funeral.\n\nYou could not have known that your wife needed you there.

Then wanted you to come home early, which you rightly said no to because you had been drinking. \n\nThen *after she got better* she changed her mind and decided you leaving was offensive. \n\nSeems to me, she just decided to be angry at you for no good reason. Basically she\u2019s gaslighting you.", "NTA. Like others have said if it was a surgery or the birth of a child  or a major medical issue that might be one thing. But it's a relatively minor sickness of a few days that she hasn't even gone to the doctor about? She's seriously acting like a child.", "Strong NTA. \n\nEven if your wife wanted you to stay home, the funeral was also for a member of your family and attending was a good thing to do. Your wife should be happy that you want to do this for your family. \n\nIf your wife was deathly ill then other considerations come to light but this was not the case. \n\nMarriages are about compromise and it\u2019s not fair to expect you to prioritise her over a funeral which is a one off.  Also it\u2019s not like you were out at a party with friends and you are prioritising your fun with others at her expense. \n\nThe \u201cmind games\u201d aspect is really exhausting and most people have grown out of that phase before finishing high school.", "NTA. Your wife definitely is tho. Not only for saying one thing and meaning another. She's an asshole for not wanting you to go period. You wanted to see your family.  Parents aren't around forever. Being sick is a lame excuse for wanting you to skip it. She's an adult.", "NTA. Your wife is the AH here for wanting one thing, saying the opposite, and then getting mad at you for doing what she said. \n\nShe needs to learn how to communicate her needs clearly and truthfully. If this is a common theme with her, she needs counseling to address it.", " NTA she should\u2019ve communicated with you instead of hoping you\u2019d read her mind", "NTA. Unfortunately your wife wanted you to read her mind rather than listen to what she said.", "Pfff people like that are annoying af. Telling you one thing and want you to be a mind reader about what they really expect of you. If its a flu or something like that yeah it sucks but a funeral of a familymember is important. NTA btw", "NTA. If she wanted you to stay home or come home same day she should have communicated that to you. Headaches and nausea are things that happen to people daily. It wasn\u2019t a serious illness or she would\u2019ve agreed to the doctor. Funerals are for the the living, you went to support your parents and to pay your respects so even if you didnt talk to your aunt often, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Tell her she needs to be direct with you. You don't appreciate the games/the passive aggressive communication. Say what you mean, mean what you say. You dont have to be mean about it.", "NTA\n\n\"I'm conflicted because i see where she's coming from\"\n\nI don't. If she had good reason to think she *actually* would have been made out to be the bad guy for asking you to stay home while she was sick, there is something more serious going on than this situation. Otherwise, say what you mean and mean what you say is a reasonable expectation.\n\nI also happen to think attending the funeral was more important.", "NTA.  Your wife is manipulative, passive aggressive and dishonest. You did nothing wrong.  If she refused to see a doctior then she wasn't actually that sick.", "NTA you're not an asshole just because she lied about being ok with something and then SUDDENLY reveals that you were meant to know the whole time she WASN'T ok with it, you offered multiple times to be with her and she waved you off every time, that's her own fault. She brought this on herself by lying and expecting you to do something she was explicitly told you not to do.  \nPlus, it's not just about how much you 'care' about your aunt (you're right that it was your one chance to go to the funeral), you mentioned that it would also be a chance for you to see your parents for the first time in a while, I don't really think you would have been an asshole even if your wife HAD asked you to stay, funerals are an important chance to say goodbye and see those important to you.", "NTA.  I don't have a lot of patience for people who say something is fine with them but actually expect you to read their mind and know that it really isn't.\n\nWhere you maybe made a poor choice was drinking at the wake so you'd be unable to drive home the same day if she had taken a serious turn for the worse.

Odd seeing as we were just communicating about  the post, I didn't agree with your comment. Questioned it and we came to an understanding/agreement just like OP and his wife, should do!  Redditors love a downvote for nothing.", "I am fine with tha. If I can't handle downvotes on a SM plattform, something would be definitly be wrong with me. :-)", "NTA, ur Wife on the other hand is a Huge one. I understand if ur sick u love someone to take care of u, I have the same when my boyfriend is with me. But when I'm alone I'll take care of myself , unless it's really really bad (which probably only happened once ) I'll go to my mom so she can help me a little. I'm sorry for your loss , and I hope u had a great time with ur family", "NTA. She sounds very immature", "NTA it sounds like a no- win situation, tell your wife you're sorry she feels that way and leave it at that. No matter what you say she's going to be unhappy so stop trying", "Ur wife is not a nice lady", "I dated a girl with BPD for a year-and-a-half and she used to pull shit like this all the time. She would also get \"sick\" right around the time that I would be getting ready to spend time with friends or family. The illness was always vague headaches and nausea (but, oddly, never a fever, vomiting, or diarrhea - ie: nothing tangible), she would always also say that she'll be ok, or that it's getting better, or that it's nothing that would require me to be by her side 24/7. Invariably, when I would get home later in the evening, or when we got up the next morning, I would be in for it. Cold shoulder was the best-case scenario.\n\nJust sayin', OP.\n\nNTA", "No ages, so I have to ask- is your wife out of her teens?\n\nMature women have passed the point of expecting their partners to be mind-readers.\n\nTell your wife to grow up and communicate honestly.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - it may be that your wife was just feeling particularly mis we ravle and lonely while you were gone, which she didn't anticipate. Being ill sucks.\n\nI would apologize that you didn't come back early but also make clear if she does or doesn't want you to do something, she needs to actually say so rather than expecting you to read her mind. \n\nI would also demand she see a doctor now. At least she can drop by an urgent care. If she was sick 3nough to need a nurse then she needs medical diagnosis.", "NTA she is an adult who can get herself to urgent care or to her doctor. She is being extremely immature and selfish instead of supporting you during this time of grief. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA", "NTA. You offered to stay and she said you could go. Her acting petty and passive aggressive is wildly immature and manipulative. She\u2019s a grown woman and if she can\u2019t use her big girl words to communicate what she wants or needs to her husband, then she\u2019s not capable of a serious relationship.", "NTA. You offered to stay and she said no. You told her your plan and stuck to it. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\n\nAll her gripes are fabricated bulldust. She\u2019s either very immature or she\u2019s manipulating you.\n\nAdults use their words, they don\u2019t expect mind reading.", "NTA, but you are learning the lesson many newly married men learn by hard experience, no mean means no, but yes also sometimes means no, and they will get mad at you for not reading their minds.", "NTA. You suggested to skip the funeral and stay with your wife and she said that that wasn't necessary. And then afterwards she was angry at you for attending the funeral. That is ridiculous, if she wanted you to say at home, she should have said so.", "No way you are not the a. She\u2019s immature. She needs to grow up and communicate what she really wants and needs. This to me is abuse tactics. \u201cI am mad at you for doing what I said to do but you should have known what I really meant and wanted\u201d. She also needs to learn to be okay on her own. What if something happens to you? She expects you to baby her because she\u2019s sick? This is just ridiculous. It wasn\u2019t like she was deathly ill and truly needed a caretaker.", "NTA Your wife wasn\u2019t honest with you and expected you to read her mind. If she wasn\u2019t fine with you going she needed to tell you that before you went.", "NTA.  Tell your wife that she needs to use her words if she is in distress.  She refused to go to the doctor beforehand and she obviously managed what seemed to be minor symptoms.  Tell her to not stick you in no win situation.", "She's acting like a teen girl lol. NTA you did nothing wrong op.", "NTA \n\nShe told you that she was feeling better. This js manipulative and immature on her part.", "Your wife needs to learn to communicate better.", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have said she was ok with you going when she wasn\u2019t, but i would have skipped drinking and headed home to make sure my sick spouse was ok. The funeral was one thing, hanging out after and drinking seems kind of insensitive.", "This isn't gaslighting, she's just acting like a spoiled child. Passive aggressive behavior, absolutely as well.", "RIP I'm very sorry for your loss of you. \ud83e\udea6\ud83e\udde1"]}
