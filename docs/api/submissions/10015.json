She apparently wanted you to stay, even though she said completely the opposite.

You gave her ample opportunities to tell you she wanted you to stay. She indicated that she would be fine without you. She has no right to be upset that you did exactly what she told you to do. And in all honesty I think you have the right to go to the funeral even if she DID a want you to stay home with her (assuming she\u2019s not deathly ill) - I would\u2019ve tried to find a friend or family member to check in on her if it was necessary. I feel like sometimes people don\u2019t realize\u2026 wakes and funerals are more for the living than they are for the dead. It\u2019s nice to pay respects to the departed, but it\u2019s more important to show support to the loved ones left behind.\n\nEDIT: a typo", "NTA. She\u2019s a grown ass adult, playing childish games and expecting you to be a mind reader. \nYou literally offered to stay and she said no, so why turn the tables and play childish games?", "NTA. She's gaslighting you. She needs to learn how to communicate like an adult.", "NTA.  Ok, sick people can get cranky.  But your wife is a grown woman and can ask for what she needs.  You can\u2019t negotiate about a problem you don\u2019t know exists.  It\u2019s simplistic (and childish) to suggest you\u2019re picking your dead aunt over your wife.  You didn\u2019t miss the birth of your child or leave while she had surgery.  She could take care of herself.  You took care of yourself as well by attending the funeral\u2014you didn\u2019t demand she get off her sick bed and accompany you.  There was no way you both could have fully managed both situations, so you each managed what you needed to manage.", "NTA \n\nShe is manipulative and. Passive aggressive.

Your wife wanted you to prioritize her. Unfortunately, she lied so convincingly that you thought she was safe to be alone while you took an overnight trip for a funeral.\n\nYou could not have known that your wife needed you there. The conversation you both need to have needs to be a straightforward and honest one. Your wife cannot expect her needs to be met when she convinces you that she has no needs for you to meet.", "NTA. She\u2019s gaslighting and manipulating you.", "Bruh. NTA. You offered to stay and SHE said no. These mind games in relationships are very exhausting when communication should be direct in these situations. \n\nYou offer, she says yes, you stay and take care of her and everyone is happy.

Then wanted you to come home early, which you rightly said no to because you had been drinking. \n\nThen *after she got better* she changed her mind and decided you leaving was offensive. \n\nSeems to me, she just decided to be angry at you for no good reason. Basically she\u2019s gaslighting you.", "NTA. Like others have said if it was a surgery or the birth of a child  or a major medical issue that might be one thing. But it's a relatively minor sickness of a few days that she hasn't even gone to the doctor about? She's seriously acting like a child.", "Strong NTA. \n\nEven if your wife wanted you to stay home, the funeral was also for a member of your family and attending was a good thing to do. Your wife should be happy that you want to do this for your family. \n\nIf your wife was deathly ill then other considerations come to light but this was not the case. \n\nMarriages are about compromise and it\u2019s not fair to expect you to prioritise her over a funeral which is a one off.  Also it\u2019s not like you were out at a party with friends and you are prioritising your fun with others at her expense. \n\nThe \u201cmind games\u201d aspect is really exhausting and most people have grown out of that phase before finishing high school.", "NTA. Your wife definitely is tho. Not only for saying one thing and meaning another. She's an asshole for not wanting you to go period. You wanted to see your family.  Parents aren't around forever. Being sick is a lame excuse for wanting you to skip it. She's an adult.", "NTA. Your wife is the AH here for wanting one thing, saying the opposite, and then getting mad at you for doing what she said. \n\nShe needs to learn how to communicate her needs clearly and truthfully. If this is a common theme with her, she needs counseling to address it.", " NTA she should\u2019ve communicated with you instead of hoping you\u2019d read her mind", "NTA. Unfortunately your wife wanted you to read her mind rather than listen to what she said.", "Pfff people like that are annoying af. Telling you one thing and want you to be a mind reader about what they really expect of you. If its a flu or something like that yeah it sucks but a funeral of a familymember is important. NTA btw", "NTA. If she wanted you to stay home or come home same day she should have communicated that to you. Headaches and nausea are things that happen to people daily. It wasn\u2019t a serious illness or she would\u2019ve agreed to the doctor. Funerals are for the the living, you went to support your parents and to pay your respects so even if you didnt talk to your aunt often, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Tell her she needs to be direct with you. You don't appreciate the games/the passive aggressive communication. Say what you mean, mean what you say. You dont have to be mean about it.", "NTA\n\n\"I'm conflicted because i see where she's coming from\"\n\nI don't. If she had good reason to think she *actually* would have been made out to be the bad guy for asking you to stay home while she was sick, there is something more serious going on than this situation. Otherwise, say what you mean and mean what you say is a reasonable expectation.\n\nI also happen to think attending the funeral was more important.", "NTA.  Your wife is manipulative, passive aggressive and dishonest. You did nothing wrong.  If she refused to see a doctior then she wasn't actually that sick.", "NTA you're not an asshole just because she lied about being ok with something and then SUDDENLY reveals that you were meant to know the whole time she WASN'T ok with it, you offered multiple times to be with her and she waved you off every time, that's her own fault. She brought this on herself by lying and expecting you to do something she was explicitly told you not to do.  \nPlus, it's not just about how much you 'care' about your aunt (you're right that it was your one chance to go to the funeral), you mentioned that it would also be a chance for you to see your parents for the first time in a while, I don't really think you would have been an asshole even if your wife HAD asked you to stay, funerals are an important chance to say goodbye and see those important to you.", "NTA.  I don't have a lot of patience for people who say something is fine with them but actually expect you to read their mind and know that it really isn't.\n\nWhere you maybe made a poor choice was drinking at the wake so you'd be unable to drive home the same day if she had taken a serious turn for the worse.

She encouraged you to go and reassured you she was feeling better when the question of returning early was raised.

If I were you, I\u2019d be doing a lot of reflecting to see if this is part of a larger pattern. This may be a one time thing because she was feeling particularly vulnerable being sick.
