An argument that recurs frequently (especially when we\u2019re on vacation) centers around her desire to take multiple photos\u2026& my absolute *disdain* for being the person who has to take all of them. \n\nHere\u2019s how it typically plays out: we visit a new place, she immediately asks me to take her picture\u2026I oblige, but then she berates me if the picture is \u201cugly\u201d or if she thinks I made little attempt to take a good picture. So then I have to take another photo. She reviews, and the process repeats until she\u2019s satisfied. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve never been big on taking photos while on vacation, AND I have not travelled a lot internationally. I like to be in the moment, take in the whole sight, and get lost in my thoughts. However, I feel like I have to interrupt this experience multiple times to take her pictures, or get into a selfie with her, then I lose out on the experience because all of a sudden a photo takes precedence. In the past, I\u2019ve snapped a quick picture with little effort, to get back to what I was there to do: experience something new. After getting called out multiple times for my low effort, I now attempt to take a good picture or at least listen to her instructions so that I get the picture to her liking. But recently, she\u2019s called my pictures ugly even when I\u2019ve made an attempt to take \u201cgood\u201d photos. This results in me taking dozens of pictures in the same place, of the same person, with the same backdrop, until she is satisfied OR until I lose patience and tell her I\u2019m done. \n\nMoreover, she\u2019s even gotten upset with me for posting a picture of her to social media that she didn\u2019t like, even though I actually thought the picture looked good. My wife is naturally gorgeous, physically, but I don\u2019t need a \u201cgood\u201d picture to show that. I\u2019d like to consider myself a creative, and sometimes I just like a good candid picture of her eating an ice cream or fixing her glasses. But let me unwittingly share said photo on social media, and a whole argument ensues. \n\nI think the whole situation is stupid. IMO Photographs are an afterthought - a tool - not the main objective. I want to see new things and experience new people; I have little desire to take pictures beyond what I need to remember the moment, or to capture something aesthetically pleasing. I know it\u2019s reasonable to want pictures of yourself, but at some point the whole exercise becomes excessive - imo that point is when the pictures began to distract from the whole purpose we\u2019re there: to see and experience something new. \n\nMy wife and I are currently in Italy, sitting silently in a hotel room, because I objected to her 20th-something selfie in front of the colosseum.  It\u2019s raining and I wanted to move to the next site (we had already taking *many* photos together in font of the coliseum. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682871843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133w8ub/aita_for_not_wanting_to_take_my_wifes_photos/", "score": 217, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How do you 'unwittingly' share a photo on social media? \n\nLook, people take pictures, lots of pictures, while they are on vacation. That's hardly an unusual preference. Some people don't value pictures all that much because they want to be 'present' and I understand why obsessing over how something looks in photos can get in the way of the true experience but honestly both are possible. You come across as really dismissive and haughty towards her perspective.\n\nI think you should both be more considerate of each other. Of course it is not ok for her to berate you or to demand excessive time be spent perfecting a photo. It's great that you heard her request and tried to put more effort in, and it's unfortunate that she wasn't satisfied. \n\nBut it sounds like she has low self-confidence or is self-conscious of how she looks in photos which sadly is pretty common and it's really not ok to post photos of someone else without their permission if you know they want to review and be ok with all posted pics.", "ESH \nHow are you MARRIED and this unable to communicate and find a compromise?\nForget all the people in the comments with the obvious answer (selfie stick) - have you even once talked about this issue that's apparently a recurring problem in your relationship?", "Ehh. I think y\u2019all should practice getting the photos how she likes them when you\u2019re at home or not on vacation. Then you can do more of a snap and go bc you\u2019ll be more in tune with what she\u2019s looking for. NAH here imo just two people with differing priorities who need to figure out how to accommodate the other.", "YTA. She likes taking pictures and if you actually put effort into it I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t need to take 100.", "NTA you\u2019re her husband not her photographer. Moreover you\u2019re enjoying a vacation not there to take a million pictures for her to share of herself on social media. Why not take pictures of the views instead of herself. Doesn\u2019t make sense", "NTA, my wife used to do this. Our compromise on this is i will take photo constantly for about 20 secs. If she doesnt like any of them I will do once more. I will not do it a third time. She usually gets a good number and can pick one she likes.", "ESH - i recently searched through our family photos to find pictures of The Grandparents for a sibling's wedding memorial table. I found a ton of the grandfathers and almost none of the grandmothers, because the grandmothers were always the ones taking the photos. It was a gendered thing because for some reason the men in the family never thought pictures were important, but the women did. Take pictures of your wife, so that she is included in the memories when your grandchildren look back through the photo albums.  But she should be doing the same for you.", "ESH the insistence on multiple photos is annoying and would really bother me if I was trying to relax on vacation, but you shouldn\u2019t be posting pictures of her to social media without her ok.", "ESH I don't agree with your stance on photos and I love them to remember experiences. Your wife however is leaning too much on the pictures. If she's that nitpicky she needs to take her own photos. I would tell her you're trying your best but you aren't her personal photographer. Tell her you'll take 3 pictures and she can choose the best. Take it or leave it.\nMaybe when yall aren't on vacation go over some of her rejects and find out what she doesn't like about them.

I hate how you can't go anywhere anymore without people needing photos of themselves in front of X ..to what? prove they were there? I get taking photos of a beautiful site you're visiting, I took tons at chichen itza, but I didn't take any of myself, and I didn't hog the space by needing 20+ photos of myself in front of the thing that everyone is there to see. It's selfish and totally unaware of others to behave like this. But unfortunately I see it all the time, people totally self absorbed thinking their photo shoot is the most important. I'd personally say that I'd take one photo and no more. \n\nSo now she's sulking in the hotel room? Fun trip.", "NAH. I get where your wife is coming from - she wants a nice picture of her at location. I'm not big on selfies so I'd rather have someone (like a boyfriend or husband, like you), take it instead. I try to get my boyfriend to take a nice one of me but he shows little effort to take a good one which leads to blah photos, while I have 100s of great photos of him. Because like your wife, I like taking pictures, and I want happy photos from the trip - not ones that are eh. I don't think she's an AH for wanting a nice photo, but I also understand that taking several shots can get annoying. I'm sure she has lots of great ones of you, and she just wants the same attention to her. Neither of you are AHs; just find a way to meet in the middle. As others have suggested, maybe gift her a selfie stick so she can try to get herself good and it shows you care about her picture taking, allowing you to also be more in the moment.", "YTA - she is telling you this is important to her and you are saying \u201cokay well I think it\u2019s fucking stupid.\u201d I\u2019m a visual person.

They\u2019re special for me.\n\nThere is literally a meme of a boyfriend being in an awkward angle just to get a really great photo of his girlfriend BECAUSE HE SUPPORTS HER. \n\nYou can easily compromise here, set a time limit \u201cI\u2019ll take as many photos of you as you want for 5 minutes, then we move on\u201d but nope, you\u2019ve decided it\u2019s stupid and unimportant and are like actively damaging your relationship with your wife for\u2026 what?", "ESH. Mostly your wife; you're her husband, not her personal photographer. But equally, posting pics of her that she doesn't like isn't really on.", "NTA/ESH\n\nThere is a lot to unpack here and issues are being conflated. \n\nFirst, sharing photos on social media should have consent, even in a marriage. Photos for yourself, fine; photos to share with others, get consent. \n\nSecond, let her show you all the little zoom, light adjustment, and any other features she would like you to use. Better yet, let her place you where she'd like to be photo'd, let her make all the camera adjustments, and then switch places with her. She spends her time doing all the photo prep while you enjoy the scenery, it's a win-win.\n\nThird, have a good faith number of photos per location, like 3-5, or something. After which she's obviously free to take any number of photos on her own, but you're also free of obligation to participate in her photos.\n\nGo get some dinner and enjoy your lovely evening in Italy!", "YTA - maybe try taking the darn picture with a bit of enthusiasm.  Because one day, you will wake up and your wife will hate you because she feels like you don\u2019t care about her and don\u2019t appreciate her and when you ask her when it started, she will pinpoint the day you were a jerk and didn\u2019t want to take her photo (and a good one) on vacation and Italy\u2026 and that will be the day she fell out of love with you.", "NTA. Get her a selfie stick and tell her to have fun.", "Disdain is a very odd emotion to feel about this issue. It also feels like you don\u2019t really want to go on holiday with your wife, preferring to \u2018get lost in your thoughts\u2019 and not liking being interrupted by her presence.\n\nYou don\u2019t respect that she doesn\u2019t like certain photos you take and want them on social media, although you can easily keep candid photos and memories for yourself.\n\nYou supposedly hate the process of photography but \u2018consider yourself a creative\u2019.\n\nYou think the situation, and your wife, is stupid.\n\nYou don\u2019t sound like a good travelling partner, or indeed partner.\n\nYTA", "YTA.

You can set a limit to something like 3 minutes taking photos and then if she still isn\u2019t satisfied, she can take selfies etc. But I want you to seriously look into yourself and wonder why you\u2019re treating this like a terrible chore when it makes your wife so happy.\n\nOf course it\u2019s annoying to take tons of photos over and over again, but the difference between a bad photo and a good one is massive. It\u2019s pretty sad for her if photos are important to her and you\u2019ve only taken 3 horrible, unfocused photos from awful angles and treated it like torture in the process. This clearly is important to your wife\u2014take a few minutes for each new location to take nice, clear, thoughtful photos, and you will be showing your wife you care about her while barely spending any time yourself on this at all.\n\nAlso, stop posting photos of her without her consent when she\u2019s told you it bothers her.", "Have you had a sit down, heart to heart conversation about this? I couldn\u2019t imagine spending the money to travel and being bitter over picture taking.

I believe pictures are supposed to capture moments, not experiences revolving around pictures. \n\nDefinitely NTA", " NTA. You obviously have different takes on photos. It's not about who's right it's about respecting each other. \n\nI am a woman and I like to take some pics,but I understand my preferences shouldn't make my SO uncomfortable.\n\nIf she wants a full photoshoot she can do that by herself or with some friends. There's also photographer's who need experience and don't charge that much, and she will looove those pics way more that the \"bad\" ones you would take.", "INFO: how many retakes are we talking?\n\nSounds like at the beginning you might have been TA, taking self-admitted low effort pictures, but your wife might also be suffering from Instagram photo blues.\n\nSelfie stick?", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Totally reasonable for you to be annoyed with endless picture taking. But it sounds like your wife is dealing with some classic body image issues if she\u2019s so sensitive to getting a \u201cgood\u201d picture and so upset over candid pictures being posted. I can\u2019t judge her to harshly for that. This selfie/Instagram culture is just fuel for these kind of issues and you can get caught in a cycle where you NEED \u201cgood\u201d pictures to reassure yourself. Especially for those of us seeing the changes of age for the very first time. I would recommend having a talk with her and pointing out her sensitivities to pictures and how she feels about herself right now.

Either do it with a smile, or nip it in the bud once and for all.", ">Photographs are an afterthought - a tool - not the main objective\n\nI like this take, it's a good thing to remember. That being said, NAH. I understand that you wish to live in the moment, and that is completely valid and even admirable in the times we love in. However, I will not judge your wife for wanting to take pictures as well, or not feeling satisfied with her photos; that is how most people are. if she takes 20 of the same place then that certainly is excessive and you should not be forced to participate. But you should also not pass judgement on what she wants. I think it would be best to communicate with each other calmly and invest in a tripod with a remote or something. I have one of those because i love taking multiple photos and the people around me don't, so this tripod solves everything", "You are NTA. Your wife is somewhat of an AH. You both should be enjoying the moment. \n\nHave you asked her if you both enjoy those first moments of the new experience and save the pictures for when you're ready to move on?", "NTA that would irritate me if I was trying to relax", "NTA. I've seen people trapped in this hell and it's not pretty. A constantly dissatisfied partner who's highly anxious about their image (it seems to reach body dysmorphia  level anxiety) and taking it out on their partner.\n\n If I'm you I'm not engaging is this anymore. Make her a promise to get through vacation- you won't post pictures of her period. She can have total editorial control over her image. But in exchange you won't get involved in her photography either. You join her for 3-5 shots if she wants to use a selfie stick but you'll no longer be her photograper. And you both commit to seeing a marriage counselor.\n\nThis would be a deal breaker for me- there's no way in the world I'm living like this.", "NTA But I'm going to give you a blanket bit of advice here. NEVER, ever ever post a picture of someone eating without their explicit permission. If someone posted a picture of me eating ice cream I would literally smother them in their sleep, no one looks good eating ice cream, plus if your wife has any insecurities about her weight she's going to feel like people will judge her just because she's eating something unhealthy.", "NTA. I totally get your point in wanting to only take pictures to capture moments or something interesting or aesthetically pleasing. I have traveled with friends who are always taking videos and pics to post to their stories, and it's even a bit challenging to have a conversation with them in the moment.", "As a female I love having photos taken for memories as one day that's all you'll have left to remind you of good times.. my tip would be to buy her a phone tripod so she can set it up herself and snap away.. it's what I do then everyone gets what they want, she gets as many photos as she wants and it doesnt irrate you.. I have a tripod with a little remote connected via bluetooth it's very effective", "NTA, OP\n\nI am a well-traveled international traveler and people like her annoy tf out of me. Sounds like your wife is a wannabe influencer. Just another tourist who doesn't actually care about the experience and monopolizes a spot in a popular tourist destination to have their own personal photoshoot for an hour, nevermind other people also want photos in that spot and you are being a rude A-hole taking up the space.

She\u2019s literally ruining what should be a wonderful time for you Over a fake photo.  Why do I say fake because she looks great but her man is starting to resent and like her less.  That\u2019s how relationships slowly die.  Hate to be dramatic but resentment is a relationship poison.   Also, you hate/don\u2019t take good photos.  So girl wants a husband or a selfie stick?!?", "NTA and this speaks to a larger issue - your values. Sounds like you value experiences wheras she values appearances.", "NTA but I gotta admit it feels very hard for me to see things from your wife's position. I like photography so I will spend a lot of time taking pictures - but never of myself. But I have a friend who has the same huge selfie obsession and I almost went crazy on our last weekend trip... I swear I have more selfies from those three days than from my backbacking trip over four months and yeah... I can't deal with that.\n\nBut when I think of that friend and try to be empathetic: I guess your wife is one of those people who sees photography as documentation - not a hobby or art form. It seems incredibly important to her to document literally every spot we've been to and in my opinion it can turn into a bit of an obsession. I guess social media and modern technology (always having your phone with you) doesn't help. I don't really have good advice for you, only that when I think of my friend, the selfies really are that important to her that she was legit hurt when I got cranky about it (although she also got impatient and cranky when I didn't cooperate).\n\nYou can only try to explain your stance to your wife, telling her that this need of having the perfect picture of every spot you visit is stressing you out and asking her to find a compromise. Maybe reduce the number of pictures to five sightseeing spots a day and maybe another three pretty spots you walk past on accident.", "NTA but tell her to take photos of you all day and let\u2019s see how she feels. The obsession with pictures nowadays is crazy. She should stop being selfish and focus on enjoying the vacation.", "NTA, why don't you just let her know you can take 3 photos (with effort), and that's that.

However, if your wife is having problems that are causing her to compulsively photograph herself over and over, then this is something she needs to talk to someone about.\n\nIt seems like you two need to have a conversation and work out what is essential to each of you and what can be compromised on, there's lots of good ideas in the comments.

Tell her you love her, she's beautiful, but you need to resolve this issue because this neediness is ruining vacations for you. The solution is not taking perfect pictures of her because she will never be satisfied with your choices.", "NTA your wife is acting like a brat", "NTA. Take a video for 30 seconds and then she can pause and screenshot or capture the frame of the ones she likes. It\u2019s boring taking pictures of people when there are new things to see and experience, and when you are the only one taking photos you get home and realize that while you have endless proof of who you went with there are NONE of you. \nAlso photography is an art for a reason- while anyone can point and shoot not everyone can get what truly makes a good photo. She is expecting you to capture the kind of pictures that very skilled people get PAID to take, despite knowing that you don\u2019t actually have any interest in photography, lighting, composition, or telling her to tilt her chin 30 degrees while pointing her right toe and shifting her left hip back.", "NTA I enjoy taking photos when I travel, but then I do it quickly, and put the camera down to actually enjoy the place. Having someone insist on you taking dozens of pictures of them would be obnoxious! Buy her a selfie stick and tell her you\u2019re off duty now.", "NTA and this needs to be nipped before you have kids.  Otherwise every vacation will be spent with getting the kids in the right clothes, right poses, right light, and then dealing with the tantrum when they are fed up.  Actually watched this happen on our trip to Grand Canyon a few years ago...mom insisting on just one more photo and the kids throwing a massive tantrum because they had been sitting there way too long, and dad just giving up.", "NTA - sounds like you\u2019ve married a bit of a narcissist, no?", "NTA, surprised you married her after dealing with this for years", "NTA, maybe suggest disposable cameras!", "Halfway between ESH and NTA. She's a bigger asshole than you in this that's for sure.", "Buy her a selfie stick.", "NTA, I grew up where you took pictures with a camera and had the film developed. Sometimes you waited months before seeing your pictures. Cell phones, selfies, social media, it all feels so vain. Makes me feel uncomfortable.\nGeneration X", "NTA\n\nI'm old. I've learned that photography is a skill beyond my abilities. If my family wants good pictures, they take them. \n\nNot experiencing where you are because you're too busy complying with a demand that you to take pictures of them is a waste of money, time and is disrespectful to you and your desire to learn and experience where you are... Her demand is entitled, rude, self-centred behaviour.\n\nIf your wife wants a perfect photo and Belittles any attempts you make at taking one, then the job is hers. She can get a selfie stick.", "NTA seems like she\u2019s more interested in posting for social media attention then she is in the actual vacation", "NTA. Cannot stand compulsive photography. If your pictures vanish, were you there? I like taking a Fe pictures but mostly, I prefer to use my eyes and my memory.", "I went into this totally thinking you were TA considering I can be that person that wants a million and one pictures of vacations and memories but that's just ridiculous even I wouldn't do that. NTA", "You don\u2019t have to spend every single day of the vacation together", "ESH. We live in the digital age. When it's time to take a picture, take five. Count them off. 1, 2, 3, snap. 1, 2, 3, snap. etc. Create this as your agreement. Additionally, no photos are reviewed until the end of the day. You get the photos you get. Be adults, identify your issues, work together to create solutions.", "YTA, no question.", "ESH. Your wife for being obsessed with perfect pictures and allowing that to ruin the actual experience, you for sharing \u201ccandids\u201d and being incredibly cringe about how creative you are (newsflash, if your pictures of her are lousy, then your \u201ccreative candids\u201d are probably nothing special either) when you KNOW not looking perfect on social media bothers her.", "NTA. Seems like you are incompatible in terms of vacationing, should probably take separate vacations to make the marriage work", "ESH. talk to your wife. you\u2019re both sulking and you\u2019re posting on reddit when there are several boundaries you could have put up because you\u2019re both adults. she wants pictures, fine, its nice to have memories. put some effort in and tell her you\u2019ll only take so many before you want to put the camera away and sight see. no, she shouldn\u2019t have berated you but you could have been so much nicer about it. shes your WIFE. you are supposed to love each other and communicate!", "NTA. But, I\u2019ve been in your wife\u2019s shoes. Our compromise is get the pic done right away, but take a dozen (just keep clicking) and telling her  keep moving around. That way she doesn\u2019t have to keep checking them and you have ti keep repositioning as a photographer. There\u2019s bound to be a good one if you literally get 10 photos.\n\nEdit: also, if i do a pic, i get one pic/spot per outing on vacation. Eliminates the \u201cpic by the rock, pic by the tree, pic with the view\u201d. Tell her she doesn\u2019t need to be in every damn photo lol", "ESH - you know photos are important to her, but you don't think the ones she thinks are important are important. But you value the pictures you take and value them over her objections.\n\nShe needs to knock it off, but you need to take her feelings into consideration.\n\nAnd some people are just awful at taking pictures. My partner is absolutely incapable of taking a photograph about 90% of the time. But I do like taking pictures though.", "YTA for sharing a picture of your wife without her consent. I don't care about your privacy setting, that's a big no. \n\nBack to the problem at hand - first of all, learn to take better pictures. Second, agree on certain picture tours and explicit no-picture experiences. (My partner and I discuss the amount of cameras he may take with him when we go out.) Pictures may not be important to you, but they are for your wife. Learn to care about the things she likes. And the better your pictures, the quicker you can go back to your experience. (Also, do trips on your own.)", "Dude just take 5 snaps in rapid movement and let her edit. Why ruin your fun. If she can't look right after 5 shots she is the problem.", "NTA. Buy her a selfie stick and show her boyfriends of instagram. It makes fun of the people (typically but not always women) who have others (presumably a partner) taking all their glam shots.", "Exactly, OP, buy your wife a selfie stick.  Maybe she'll think it's a passive aggressive gift but maybe it will actually be practical for your situation!!!", "And a clip on light for the front of her phone, absolutely no excuses then \n\n\nNta", "I was going to say the same thing selfie sticks are great and she doesn\u2019t have to bother anyone else.", "I came here to say the same thing!  Selfie Stick and Google Assistant.", "I feel like a tripod and the lens buddy app would be better for her instead of forcing her husband to take pictures", "I think the \"unwittingly\" was more a gesture at sarcasm, as in, he thought he was sharing a nice picture, not that he mistakenly shared a picture.\n\nAnyways, I'll disagree and say NTA. From the description, OP sounds fairly accommodating to the photo request. I think they either gotta set some better guidelines or buy a selfie stick", "Or she could be an unreasonable self centered, attention seeking wife,  her perspective is an extremely problematic attitude, very prevalent in todays social media and  vain driven mindset.", "Taking pictures on vacation is one thing. I take pictures of landmarks and scenery. I never think to take pictures of me and my partner and especially selfies. Sure take a couple pictures of your partner. But what he described is not normal and I would literally refuse to take any pics at that point.", "Selfie stick and checking out the pro photographers who give tips on how to pose and take good pictures. There is room for compromise, why are they so stuck on getting entirely their way?\n\nESH", "Agreed. Op, you need to have a real conversation about this without being defensive or dismissive about whatever she says. You have to figure out a solution that works for you both. \n\nPerhaps you will oblige to take several photos at major venues once. Maybe a max number of times a day you will be her photographer, putting in good effort, and no retakes after, \"ugly\" or not. Let her know that this is something that takes away from your vacation, but don't be upset if she says that having good photos of herself adds to hers. Figure out how to compromise.", "This is great. Agrees to help partner *with* boundaries and limits. Perfect.", "This is a great compromise. She gets her photos and you make sure you\u2019re not spending a ridiculous amount of time behind a camera.", "Yup! I\u2019ve noticed this a lot to with husbands and wives. \nAnd also when kids grow up too? \n\nMy favourite gift I ever gave to an ex\u2019s mum was two framed photos of her kids (my ex, his brother, and three little sisters) posed in the garden dressed nicely. She cried. \n\nAnd I recently took pictures of my mother in law with her adult daughters. \n\nAt some stage the picture taking slows down :(", "Yes, there are two very different issues here. \n\nYou're not obliged to take photos, but you do need to respect others' privacy.", "I agree, he comes off really condescending in this post and he shouldn't be posting photos of her without her consent. If he cares so little about photos, why is it so important to him that he post \"candid\" shots of her eating ice cream?", "I\u2019m new to this group what is ESH?", "I totally agree. My husband used to take our extremely large camcorder everywhere with him. It was like another appendage. We were in Alaska and all I wanted was time with Him while he was rabbiting around taking videos of icebergs.", "Meh, you do you. I don\u2019t take lots of pictures of myself but I also don\u2019t put down people who do. She\u2019s unreasonable for throwing a hissy fit, not for taking pictures of herself. People take pictures of themselves in a location to remember themselves in that moment and share the moment with others, even long after.", "I have ten years of minimal to crap photos of myself taken by my husband that I practically had to beg for, of holidays and with our kids that I\u2019ll never be able to redo. I\u2019ve taken plenty of great photos of him that we can frame around the house. I wish I had been confident enough to be like OP\u2019s wife.", "Thank you! I had to scroll so far to find this!", "The same could be said for the wife.  Why are shot so quick to dismiss his wants and boundaries?? Because he\u2019s a dude?", "Why? It\u2019s a stupid picture, wife should stop being so vain and actually enjoy a vacation", "Amen.", "I mean, its not like she's keeping all of these photos she hates, she just wants one where she feels good about herself. And I absolutely understand being in a beautiful place and wanting a photo of yourself to remember you were there.\n\n\nPeople did the same thing before social media. Those photos went into scrapbooks, which were pulled out and looked through 5, 10, 20 years later. It's a *fun experience* to look through a scrapbook and reminisce, maybe with your kids or grandkids, about how young and handsome grandpa was, and how you used to be cool. Living in the moment is great and all, but that sense of majesty isn't going to follow you home a decade later, and you can't share it with the people you love.", "Yes, I can see the photo-as-documentation aspect. The first time I went to Paris, I was disappointed to get home and see that there were no photos of me at the Eiffel Tower. I\u2019d made sure to take a moment and get pics of my family, but none included me. And sure, I have the lovely memories, but a photo would have been nice. \n\nOP, since photos mean a lot to her, either encourage her to use a selfie stick, or compromise by alotting a specific amount of time, maybe five or ten minutes at each site, for photos.", "Have you ever heard of consent? I mean it\u2019s important to always ask before posting a picture of someone. Not asking and just posting someones picture is ah behaviour", "Wanting a nice photo of yourself is not self centered, attention seeking, or vain. No one wants to look bad in a photo.", "Because of how he\u2019s speaking about all of it - I don\u2019t disagree that someone needing that many photos is ridiculous, but also like - it is clearly important to her and he is just so hateful towards it, that I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s really about the photos honestly.", "Because feeling like her partner wants to take a picture is important to her.  If you are not prepared to suck it up and play along with something that is important to your partner then you suck and should not be in that relationship.  In this case it\u2019s pictures\u2026 for others it may something else.  Same concept.", "Retaking it so many times it\u2019s an issue to the point you and your companion/s can\u2019t enjoy themselves is an issue.\n\nNTA", "20+ photos in front of the same backdrop is excessive. There's nothing wrong with wanting a nice photo, asking your husband to take hundreds of photos of you is a problem. He should be able to enjoy his vacation as well, not spend it as a photographer.", "Standing by it . Read the post,  she has some serious issues.", "They've just had a fight about this, with both being upset, and him being very fed up with this particular issue. Words written in anger may not be the most accurate depiction of general, long-standing sentiments.", "He could be secretly disgusted by her self obsession and it's worn him down. People like the op wife are exhausting.", "But he does take pictures and he actually tries so why does the burden and shit fall on him just cause it isn\u2019t up to her standard? It\u2019s their vacation and not her vacation, it\u2019s not fair for OP to waste even more time doing something that is objectively stupid if he\u2019s already done it. Vacations are meant for enjoying your time", "His disgust with her is anything BUT secret, he speaks so condescendingly about her.", "OP flat out said they put in zero effort. What part of zero effort is them even trying?", "I\u2019m not sure the vacation would be enjoyable for either if he makes a stink here\u2026 He is well in his right to say no. \n\nBut this cannot be a new trait of hers\u2026 he didn\u2019t find this out after the wedding\u2026 and again, if it\u2019s important to his wife, it should not be a big deal.  If it is then it\u2019s because neither compromised. So I can amend my original vote to ESH."]}
