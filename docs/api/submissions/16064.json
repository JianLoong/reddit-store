An argument that recurs frequently (especially when we\u2019re on vacation) centers around her desire to take multiple photos\u2026& my absolute *disdain* for being the person who has to take all of them. \n\nHere\u2019s how it typically plays out: we visit a new place, she immediately asks me to take her picture\u2026I oblige, but then she berates me if the picture is \u201cugly\u201d or if she thinks I made little attempt to take a good picture. So then I have to take another photo. She reviews, and the process repeats until she\u2019s satisfied. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve never been big on taking photos while on vacation, AND I have not travelled a lot internationally. I like to be in the moment, take in the whole sight, and get lost in my thoughts. However, I feel like I have to interrupt this experience multiple times to take her pictures, or get into a selfie with her, then I lose out on the experience because all of a sudden a photo takes precedence. In the past, I\u2019ve snapped a quick picture with little effort, to get back to what I was there to do: experience something new. After getting called out multiple times for my low effort, I now attempt to take a good picture or at least listen to her instructions so that I get the picture to her liking. But recently, she\u2019s called my pictures ugly even when I\u2019ve made an attempt to take \u201cgood\u201d photos. This results in me taking dozens of pictures in the same place, of the same person, with the same backdrop, until she is satisfied OR until I lose patience and tell her I\u2019m done. \n\nMoreover, she\u2019s even gotten upset with me for posting a picture of her to social media that she didn\u2019t like, even though I actually thought the picture looked good. My wife is naturally gorgeous, physically, but I don\u2019t need a \u201cgood\u201d picture to show that. I\u2019d like to consider myself a creative, and sometimes I just like a good candid picture of her eating an ice cream or fixing her glasses. But let me unwittingly share said photo on social media, and a whole argument ensues. \n\nI think the whole situation is stupid. IMO Photographs are an afterthought - a tool - not the main objective. I want to see new things and experience new people; I have little desire to take pictures beyond what I need to remember the moment, or to capture something aesthetically pleasing. I know it\u2019s reasonable to want pictures of yourself, but at some point the whole exercise becomes excessive - imo that point is when the pictures began to distract from the whole purpose we\u2019re there: to see and experience something new. \n\nMy wife and I are currently in Italy, sitting silently in a hotel room, because I objected to her 20th-something selfie in front of the colosseum.  It\u2019s raining and I wanted to move to the next site (we had already taking *many* photos together in font of the coliseum. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682871843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133w8ub/aita_for_not_wanting_to_take_my_wifes_photos/", "score": 3613, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How do you 'unwittingly' share a photo on social media? \n\nLook, people take pictures, lots of pictures, while they are on vacation. That's hardly an unusual preference. Some people don't value pictures all that much because they want to be 'present' and I understand why obsessing over how something looks in photos can get in the way of the true experience but honestly both are possible. You come across as really dismissive and haughty towards her perspective.\n\nI think you should both be more considerate of each other. Of course it is not ok for her to berate you or to demand excessive time be spent perfecting a photo. It's great that you heard her request and tried to put more effort in, and it's unfortunate that she wasn't satisfied. \n\nBut it sounds like she has low self-confidence or is self-conscious of how she looks in photos which sadly is pretty common and it's really not ok to post photos of someone else without their permission if you know they want to review and be ok with all posted pics.", "ESH \nHow are you MARRIED and this unable to communicate and find a compromise?\nForget all the people in the comments with the obvious answer (selfie stick) - have you even once talked about this issue that's apparently a recurring problem in your relationship?", "Ehh. I think y\u2019all should practice getting the photos how she likes them when you\u2019re at home or not on vacation. Then you can do more of a snap and go bc you\u2019ll be more in tune with what she\u2019s looking for. NAH here imo just two people with differing priorities who need to figure out how to accommodate the other.", "YTA. She likes taking pictures and if you actually put effort into it I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t need to take 100.", "NTA you\u2019re her husband not her photographer. Moreover you\u2019re enjoying a vacation not there to take a million pictures for her to share of herself on social media. Why not take pictures of the views instead of herself. Doesn\u2019t make sense", "NTA, my wife used to do this. Our compromise on this is i will take photo constantly for about 20 secs. If she doesnt like any of them I will do once more. I will not do it a third time. She usually gets a good number and can pick one she likes.", "ESH - i recently searched through our family photos to find pictures of The Grandparents for a sibling's wedding memorial table. I found a ton of the grandfathers and almost none of the grandmothers, because the grandmothers were always the ones taking the photos. It was a gendered thing because for some reason the men in the family never thought pictures were important, but the women did. Take pictures of your wife, so that she is included in the memories when your grandchildren look back through the photo albums.  But she should be doing the same for you.", "ESH the insistence on multiple photos is annoying and would really bother me if I was trying to relax on vacation, but you shouldn\u2019t be posting pictures of her to social media without her ok.", "ESH I don't agree with your stance on photos and I love them to remember experiences. Your wife however is leaning too much on the pictures. If she's that nitpicky she needs to take her own photos. I would tell her you're trying your best but you aren't her personal photographer. Tell her you'll take 3 pictures and she can choose the best. Take it or leave it.\nMaybe when yall aren't on vacation go over some of her rejects and find out what she doesn't like about them.

I hate how you can't go anywhere anymore without people needing photos of themselves in front of X ..to what? prove they were there? I get taking photos of a beautiful site you're visiting, I took tons at chichen itza, but I didn't take any of myself, and I didn't hog the space by needing 20+ photos of myself in front of the thing that everyone is there to see. It's selfish and totally unaware of others to behave like this. But unfortunately I see it all the time, people totally self absorbed thinking their photo shoot is the most important. I'd personally say that I'd take one photo and no more. \n\nSo now she's sulking in the hotel room? Fun trip.", "NAH. I get where your wife is coming from - she wants a nice picture of her at location. I'm not big on selfies so I'd rather have someone (like a boyfriend or husband, like you), take it instead. I try to get my boyfriend to take a nice one of me but he shows little effort to take a good one which leads to blah photos, while I have 100s of great photos of him. Because like your wife, I like taking pictures, and I want happy photos from the trip - not ones that are eh. I don't think she's an AH for wanting a nice photo, but I also understand that taking several shots can get annoying. I'm sure she has lots of great ones of you, and she just wants the same attention to her. Neither of you are AHs; just find a way to meet in the middle. As others have suggested, maybe gift her a selfie stick so she can try to get herself good and it shows you care about her picture taking, allowing you to also be more in the moment.", "YTA - she is telling you this is important to her and you are saying \u201cokay well I think it\u2019s fucking stupid.\u201d I\u2019m a visual person.

They\u2019re special for me.\n\nThere is literally a meme of a boyfriend being in an awkward angle just to get a really great photo of his girlfriend BECAUSE HE SUPPORTS HER. \n\nYou can easily compromise here, set a time limit \u201cI\u2019ll take as many photos of you as you want for 5 minutes, then we move on\u201d but nope, you\u2019ve decided it\u2019s stupid and unimportant and are like actively damaging your relationship with your wife for\u2026 what?", "ESH. Mostly your wife; you're her husband, not her personal photographer. But equally, posting pics of her that she doesn't like isn't really on.", "NTA/ESH\n\nThere is a lot to unpack here and issues are being conflated. \n\nFirst, sharing photos on social media should have consent, even in a marriage. Photos for yourself, fine; photos to share with others, get consent. \n\nSecond, let her show you all the little zoom, light adjustment, and any other features she would like you to use. Better yet, let her place you where she'd like to be photo'd, let her make all the camera adjustments, and then switch places with her. She spends her time doing all the photo prep while you enjoy the scenery, it's a win-win.\n\nThird, have a good faith number of photos per location, like 3-5, or something. After which she's obviously free to take any number of photos on her own, but you're also free of obligation to participate in her photos.\n\nGo get some dinner and enjoy your lovely evening in Italy!", "YTA - maybe try taking the darn picture with a bit of enthusiasm.  Because one day, you will wake up and your wife will hate you because she feels like you don\u2019t care about her and don\u2019t appreciate her and when you ask her when it started, she will pinpoint the day you were a jerk and didn\u2019t want to take her photo (and a good one) on vacation and Italy\u2026 and that will be the day she fell out of love with you.", "NTA. Get her a selfie stick and tell her to have fun.", "Disdain is a very odd emotion to feel about this issue. It also feels like you don\u2019t really want to go on holiday with your wife, preferring to \u2018get lost in your thoughts\u2019 and not liking being interrupted by her presence.\n\nYou don\u2019t respect that she doesn\u2019t like certain photos you take and want them on social media, although you can easily keep candid photos and memories for yourself.\n\nYou supposedly hate the process of photography but \u2018consider yourself a creative\u2019.\n\nYou think the situation, and your wife, is stupid.\n\nYou don\u2019t sound like a good travelling partner, or indeed partner.\n\nYTA", "YTA. You talk about taking a photo, singular, with no effort, and then taking another photo, singular, with begrudging effort\u2026 listen. You can set a limit to something like 3 minutes taking photos and then if she still isn\u2019t satisfied, she can take selfies etc. But I want you to seriously look into yourself and wonder why you\u2019re treating this like a terrible chore when it makes your wife so happy.\n\nOf course it\u2019s annoying to take tons of photos over and over again, but the difference between a bad photo and a good one is massive. It\u2019s pretty sad for her if photos are important to her and you\u2019ve only taken 3 horrible, unfocused photos from awful angles and treated it like torture in the process. This clearly is important to your wife\u2014take a few minutes for each new location to take nice, clear, thoughtful photos, and you will be showing your wife you care about her while barely spending any time yourself on this at all.\n\nAlso, stop posting photos of her without her consent when she\u2019s told you it bothers her.", "Have you had a sit down, heart to heart conversation about this? I couldn\u2019t imagine spending the money to travel and being bitter over picture taking.

I believe pictures are supposed to capture moments, not experiences revolving around pictures. \n\nDefinitely NTA", " NTA. You obviously have different takes on photos. It's not about who's right it's about respecting each other. \n\nI am a woman and I like to take some pics,but I understand my preferences shouldn't make my SO uncomfortable.\n\nIf she wants a full photoshoot she can do that by herself or with some friends. There's also photographer's who need experience and don't charge that much, and she will looove those pics way more that the \"bad\" ones you would take.", "INFO: how many retakes are we talking?\n\nSounds like at the beginning you might have been TA, taking self-admitted low effort pictures, but your wife might also be suffering from Instagram photo blues.\n\nSelfie stick?", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Totally reasonable for you to be annoyed with endless picture taking. But it sounds like your wife is dealing with some classic body image issues if she\u2019s so sensitive to getting a \u201cgood\u201d picture and so upset over candid pictures being posted. I can\u2019t judge her to harshly for that. This selfie/Instagram culture is just fuel for these kind of issues and you can get caught in a cycle where you NEED \u201cgood\u201d pictures to reassure yourself. Especially for those of us seeing the changes of age for the very first time. I would recommend having a talk with her and pointing out her sensitivities to pictures and how she feels about herself right now.

Either do it with a smile, or nip it in the bud once and for all.", ">Photographs are an afterthought - a tool - not the main objective\n\nI like this take, it's a good thing to remember. That being said, NAH. I understand that you wish to live in the moment, and that is completely valid and even admirable in the times we love in. However, I will not judge your wife for wanting to take pictures as well, or not feeling satisfied with her photos; that is how most people are. if she takes 20 of the same place then that certainly is excessive and you should not be forced to participate. But you should also not pass judgement on what she wants. I think it would be best to communicate with each other calmly and invest in a tripod with a remote or something. I have one of those because i love taking multiple photos and the people around me don't, so this tripod solves everything", "You are NTA. Your wife is somewhat of an AH. You both should be enjoying the moment. \n\nHave you asked her if you both enjoy those first moments of the new experience and save the pictures for when you're ready to move on?", "NTA that would irritate me if I was trying to relax", "NTA. I've seen people trapped in this hell and it's not pretty. A constantly dissatisfied partner who's highly anxious about their image (it seems to reach body dysmorphia  level anxiety) and taking it out on their partner.\n\n If I'm you I'm not engaging is this anymore. Make her a promise to get through vacation- you won't post pictures of her period. She can have total editorial control over her image. But in exchange you won't get involved in her photography either. You join her for 3-5 shots if she wants to use a selfie stick but you'll no longer be her photograper. And you both commit to seeing a marriage counselor.\n\nThis would be a deal breaker for me- there's no way in the world I'm living like this.", "NTA But I'm going to give you a blanket bit of advice here. NEVER, ever ever post a picture of someone eating without their explicit permission. If someone posted a picture of me eating ice cream I would literally smother them in their sleep, no one looks good eating ice cream, plus if your wife has any insecurities about her weight she's going to feel like people will judge her just because she's eating something unhealthy.", "NTA. I totally get your point in wanting to only take pictures to capture moments or something interesting or aesthetically pleasing. I have traveled with friends who are always taking videos and pics to post to their stories, and it's even a bit challenging to have a conversation with them in the moment.", "As a female I love having photos taken for memories as one day that's all you'll have left to remind you of good times.. my tip would be to buy her a phone tripod so she can set it up herself and snap away.. it's what I do then everyone gets what they want, she gets as many photos as she wants and it doesnt irrate you.. I have a tripod with a little remote connected via bluetooth it's very effective", "NTA, OP\n\nI am a well-traveled international traveler and people like her annoy tf out of me. Sounds like your wife is a wannabe influencer. Just another tourist who doesn't actually care about the experience and monopolizes a spot in a popular tourist destination to have their own personal photoshoot for an hour, nevermind other people also want photos in that spot and you are being a rude A-hole taking up the space.

She\u2019s literally ruining what should be a wonderful time for you Over a fake photo.  Why do I say fake because she looks great but her man is starting to resent and like her less.  That\u2019s how relationships slowly die.  Hate to be dramatic but resentment is a relationship poison.   Also, you hate/don\u2019t take good photos.  So girl wants a husband or a selfie stick?!?", "NTA and this speaks to a larger issue - your values. Sounds like you value experiences wheras she values appearances.", "NTA but I gotta admit it feels very hard for me to see things from your wife's position. I like photography so I will spend a lot of time taking pictures - but never of myself. But I have a friend who has the same huge selfie obsession and I almost went crazy on our last weekend trip... I swear I have more selfies from those three days than from my backbacking trip over four months and yeah... I can't deal with that.\n\nBut when I think of that friend and try to be empathetic: I guess your wife is one of those people who sees photography as documentation - not a hobby or art form. It seems incredibly important to her to document literally every spot we've been to and in my opinion it can turn into a bit of an obsession. I guess social media and modern technology (always having your phone with you) doesn't help. I don't really have good advice for you, only that when I think of my friend, the selfies really are that important to her that she was legit hurt when I got cranky about it (although she also got impatient and cranky when I didn't cooperate).\n\nYou can only try to explain your stance to your wife, telling her that this need of having the perfect picture of every spot you visit is stressing you out and asking her to find a compromise. Maybe reduce the number of pictures to five sightseeing spots a day and maybe another three pretty spots you walk past on accident.", "NTA but tell her to take photos of you all day and let\u2019s see how she feels. The obsession with pictures nowadays is crazy. She should stop being selfish and focus on enjoying the vacation.", "NTA, why don't you just let her know you can take 3 photos (with effort), and that's that.

However, if your wife is having problems that are causing her to compulsively photograph herself over and over, then this is something she needs to talk to someone about.\n\nIt seems like you two need to have a conversation and work out what is essential to each of you and what can be compromised on, there's lots of good ideas in the comments.

So 1-ask your wife what she normally is conscious about in photos (maybe it\u2019s her arms, or she likes a certain side of her face better). 2- ask your wife what angles in photos she feels the most confident in. Ask her to show you her favourite photos of herself and look at her pose and angle of the camera (is it far away? Full body? On an angle?)\n3- take some time and practice with this new info casually at home.

And some people would feel very sad that their SO doesn't seem interested in saving memories with them. \n\nFor me OP point of view is valid, but also his wife point of view is valid. And the problem is that he acts all mighty and superior about the whole thing. Like she is stupid for wanting pictures. For me the wife notices this attitude and tries to compensate by asking gazillion pictures. I think it is wrong of her to do that. At the same time with modern gadgets I can easily take 20 pics of a person like in 20 secs or less, so it makes me think he really makes no effort, and she realizes and it hurts her and she doesn't know how to react and she is acting like an ah.\n\nFor me the major Ah is OP though. He needs to stop acting like he is a superior being because he prefers to be in the moment. I mean he is not, is he? If he was in the moment with his wife he would realize that taking a picture is something that she enjoys on a trip and he would like to enjoy that with her. They could arrive to a compromise, he could make an actual effort and stop acting superior. I think that superiority is what making her act that way.\n\nESH. For me she is an AH to herself for keep trying when you don't give a damn, and to you  because you dont give a damn. But you are the biggest ah. You are not the owner of the truth, and God forbid your wife dying, but you might learn to appreciate the pictures if that happens. In any case you don't need to ever like pictures, you just need to respect she does and you could learn to talk and respect her that way you can arrive to a compromise. You talk like she is a moron for liking pictures, you act that way, can you realize how that would upset her? Also for her is important what pictures of her are in social media, respect that.\n\nAnd a word of advice, if you are taking just 1 picture each time is why you always fail, take several in one shot, that way she has more options.

But I think she is acting this way because she doesn't know how to go about his attitude.\nI mean some people think  she could use a selfie-stick, she might even have one. You can't make all pictures with a selfie stick. \n\nShe could ask total strangers to take her picture, but I bet he wouldn't like that. Also he doesn't like to be in the pictures with her it seems. And she wants pictures with him.\n\nHis attitude is all wrong and she is basically acting like an ah overcompensating. At least that is the impression I get. \n\nIn the worst case she could have self-esteem issues and it is what bothers her so much about the pictures and he is treating her that way.\n\nBut you know if I were her I wouldn't even go on vacation with someone that thinks my way of enjoying things is stupid and showed in such open way. It sucks all the fun out of it. I think she just wants to make him see her way, which is also wrong. Makes you wonder how they got married when they can't even have an adult discussion about something that is really not that important.", "It's a SELF ie. If you wanna take 15 pictures of yourself be my guest but I'm not standing there doing it for you. Let's GO.", "Honestly it makes me wonder if he even likes her", "An hour throughout the day, not one hour in a row.", "I went to a wedding with my sister and spent over an hour trying to get a photo of her in front of the sunset. I have a BFA, I know how to take a picture, but some people are so particular about how they present themselves on social media that it becomes an obsession. My sister is better now, but she didn't even look at the sunset for that photo.", "Whenever my kid is invited to a birthday party I try and get as many candid shots of the other moms playing with their kids as I can and share them. I'll also offer to take photos of moms and their kids when out and about like at the museum etc. \n\nTook til our second kid for my husband to understand why I wanted photos, since I bled badly during the birth. \"I don't want them to forget my face or how much I love them if I die.\" Cried about it a bunch with my oldest but I think he assumed it was just a smaller issue. \n\nI put together a photo book recently of my older sons first year and found more photos of me and him than I anticipated. Although most of them were selfies or ones I set a timer up to take, i at least had them. Did have a few where I'm cropped at the edge like a prop instead of a person, but I remember doing the same to others before I had my son because taking someone else's photo felt so intimate.", "I paid to have newborn pictures with our kids to make sure I had lovely keepsake photos. I also arrange for professional  family photos every year. My husband doesn\u2019t shy away from pictures or grumble about the photoshoots. He just never thinks about catching those little moments, and our kids are growing up so fast.", "I can\u2019t imagine a photo of myself eating an ice cream ever being flattering though. There are candid pictures of me walking on a beach with a breeze in my hair and then there a candid pictures of me eating. I know which one I wouldn\u2019t want posted\n\nETA, just stop posting pictures of other people without their consent. Post candid pictures of yourself eating all the ice cream you want", "Man I struggle to finish 36 pictures on a roll. I\u2019ve been thinking of buying 24 exposure ones", "It's not 2 minutes though... I don't have a partner, but my former best friend was exactly like this. She would constantly nag us to go to a new place, then instead of having a good time catching up with my friends or enjoying the experience I would be stuck as her photographer. And it was THE ONLY reason she'd come! Not for me, not for the views/experience, just for the photo. It wasn't couple of pics either, it would be 100-200 pics. We checked. How is missing out on a possibly once in a life time moment a \"tiny thing\"? \n\nThe constant criticism doesn't feel good either, I have to tell you. \n\nYes, OP should talk to the wife about her self esteem and self image, see what she might be struggling with and how he can help, but that doesn't give her the right to ruin  the trip for him? She has to compromise, too.", "> I now attempt to take a good picture or at least listen to her instructions so that I get the picture to her liking. But recently, she\u2019s called my pictures ugly even when I\u2019ve made an attempt to take \u201cgood\u201d photos.\n\nEven when he tries it's not good enough for her - why isn't she trying to meet him halfway? Maybe let him enjoy the site first, take it in in his way and then take pictures at the end?", "This! You won\u2019t print and hand a photo that could have been taken by anyone, but you might if you or your lived ones are in the shot."]}
