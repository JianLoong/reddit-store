An argument that recurs frequently (especially when we\u2019re on vacation) centers around her desire to take multiple photos\u2026& my absolute *disdain* for being the person who has to take all of them. \n\nHere\u2019s how it typically plays out: we visit a new place, she immediately asks me to take her picture\u2026I oblige, but then she berates me if the picture is \u201cugly\u201d or if she thinks I made little attempt to take a good picture. So then I have to take another photo. She reviews, and the process repeats until she\u2019s satisfied. \n\nPersonally, I\u2019ve never been big on taking photos while on vacation, AND I have not travelled a lot internationally. I like to be in the moment, take in the whole sight, and get lost in my thoughts. However, I feel like I have to interrupt this experience multiple times to take her pictures, or get into a selfie with her, then I lose out on the experience because all of a sudden a photo takes precedence. In the past, I\u2019ve snapped a quick picture with little effort, to get back to what I was there to do: experience something new. After getting called out multiple times for my low effort, I now attempt to take a good picture or at least listen to her instructions so that I get the picture to her liking. But recently, she\u2019s called my pictures ugly even when I\u2019ve made an attempt to take \u201cgood\u201d photos. This results in me taking dozens of pictures in the same place, of the same person, with the same backdrop, until she is satisfied OR until I lose patience and tell her I\u2019m done. \n\nMoreover, she\u2019s even gotten upset with me for posting a picture of her to social media that she didn\u2019t like, even though I actually thought the picture looked good. My wife is naturally gorgeous, physically, but I don\u2019t need a \u201cgood\u201d picture to show that. I\u2019d like to consider myself a creative, and sometimes I just like a good candid picture of her eating an ice cream or fixing her glasses. But let me unwittingly share said photo on social media, and a whole argument ensues. \n\nI think the whole situation is stupid. IMO Photographs are an afterthought - a tool - not the main objective. I want to see new things and experience new people; I have little desire to take pictures beyond what I need to remember the moment, or to capture something aesthetically pleasing. I know it\u2019s reasonable to want pictures of yourself, but at some point the whole exercise becomes excessive - imo that point is when the pictures began to distract from the whole purpose we\u2019re there: to see and experience something new. \n\nMy wife and I are currently in Italy, sitting silently in a hotel room, because I objected to her 20th-something selfie in front of the colosseum.  It\u2019s raining and I wanted to move to the next site (we had already taking *many* photos together in font of the coliseum. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682871843, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133w8ub/aita_for_not_wanting_to_take_my_wifes_photos/", "score": 1192, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

How do you 'unwittingly' share a photo on social media? \n\nLook, people take pictures, lots of pictures, while they are on vacation. That's hardly an unusual preference. Some people don't value pictures all that much because they want to be 'present' and I understand why obsessing over how something looks in photos can get in the way of the true experience but honestly both are possible. You come across as really dismissive and haughty towards her perspective.\n\nI think you should both be more considerate of each other. Of course it is not ok for her to berate you or to demand excessive time be spent perfecting a photo. It's great that you heard her request and tried to put more effort in, and it's unfortunate that she wasn't satisfied. \n\nBut it sounds like she has low self-confidence or is self-conscious of how she looks in photos which sadly is pretty common and it's really not ok to post photos of someone else without their permission if you know they want to review and be ok with all posted pics.", "ESH \nHow are you MARRIED and this unable to communicate and find a compromise?\nForget all the people in the comments with the obvious answer (selfie stick) - have you even once talked about this issue that's apparently a recurring problem in your relationship?", "Ehh. I think y\u2019all should practice getting the photos how she likes them when you\u2019re at home or not on vacation. Then you can do more of a snap and go bc you\u2019ll be more in tune with what she\u2019s looking for. NAH here imo just two people with differing priorities who need to figure out how to accommodate the other.", "YTA. She likes taking pictures and if you actually put effort into it I\u2019m sure you wouldn\u2019t need to take 100.", "NTA you\u2019re her husband not her photographer. Moreover you\u2019re enjoying a vacation not there to take a million pictures for her to share of herself on social media. Why not take pictures of the views instead of herself. Doesn\u2019t make sense", "NTA, my wife used to do this. Our compromise on this is i will take photo constantly for about 20 secs. If she doesnt like any of them I will do once more. I will not do it a third time. She usually gets a good number and can pick one she likes.", "ESH - i recently searched through our family photos to find pictures of The Grandparents for a sibling's wedding memorial table. I found a ton of the grandfathers and almost none of the grandmothers, because the grandmothers were always the ones taking the photos. It was a gendered thing because for some reason the men in the family never thought pictures were important, but the women did. Take pictures of your wife, so that she is included in the memories when your grandchildren look back through the photo albums.  But she should be doing the same for you.", "ESH the insistence on multiple photos is annoying and would really bother me if I was trying to relax on vacation, but you shouldn\u2019t be posting pictures of her to social media without her ok.", "ESH I don't agree with your stance on photos and I love them to remember experiences. Your wife however is leaning too much on the pictures. If she's that nitpicky she needs to take her own photos. I would tell her you're trying your best but you aren't her personal photographer. Tell her you'll take 3 pictures and she can choose the best. Take it or leave it.\nMaybe when yall aren't on vacation go over some of her rejects and find out what she doesn't like about them.

I hate how you can't go anywhere anymore without people needing photos of themselves in front of X ..to what? prove they were there? I get taking photos of a beautiful site you're visiting, I took tons at chichen itza, but I didn't take any of myself, and I didn't hog the space by needing 20+ photos of myself in front of the thing that everyone is there to see. It's selfish and totally unaware of others to behave like this. But unfortunately I see it all the time, people totally self absorbed thinking their photo shoot is the most important. I'd personally say that I'd take one photo and no more. \n\nSo now she's sulking in the hotel room? Fun trip.", "NAH. I get where your wife is coming from - she wants a nice picture of her at location. I'm not big on selfies so I'd rather have someone (like a boyfriend or husband, like you), take it instead. I try to get my boyfriend to take a nice one of me but he shows little effort to take a good one which leads to blah photos, while I have 100s of great photos of him. Because like your wife, I like taking pictures, and I want happy photos from the trip - not ones that are eh. I don't think she's an AH for wanting a nice photo, but I also understand that taking several shots can get annoying. I'm sure she has lots of great ones of you, and she just wants the same attention to her. Neither of you are AHs; just find a way to meet in the middle. As others have suggested, maybe gift her a selfie stick so she can try to get herself good and it shows you care about her picture taking, allowing you to also be more in the moment.", "YTA - she is telling you this is important to her and you are saying \u201cokay well I think it\u2019s fucking stupid.\u201d I\u2019m a visual person.

They\u2019re special for me.\n\nThere is literally a meme of a boyfriend being in an awkward angle just to get a really great photo of his girlfriend BECAUSE HE SUPPORTS HER. \n\nYou can easily compromise here, set a time limit \u201cI\u2019ll take as many photos of you as you want for 5 minutes, then we move on\u201d but nope, you\u2019ve decided it\u2019s stupid and unimportant and are like actively damaging your relationship with your wife for\u2026 what?", "ESH. Mostly your wife; you're her husband, not her personal photographer. But equally, posting pics of her that she doesn't like isn't really on.", "NTA/ESH\n\nThere is a lot to unpack here and issues are being conflated. \n\nFirst, sharing photos on social media should have consent, even in a marriage. Photos for yourself, fine; photos to share with others, get consent. \n\nSecond, let her show you all the little zoom, light adjustment, and any other features she would like you to use. Better yet, let her place you where she'd like to be photo'd, let her make all the camera adjustments, and then switch places with her. She spends her time doing all the photo prep while you enjoy the scenery, it's a win-win.\n\nThird, have a good faith number of photos per location, like 3-5, or something. After which she's obviously free to take any number of photos on her own, but you're also free of obligation to participate in her photos.\n\nGo get some dinner and enjoy your lovely evening in Italy!", "YTA - maybe try taking the darn picture with a bit of enthusiasm.  Because one day, you will wake up and your wife will hate you because she feels like you don\u2019t care about her and don\u2019t appreciate her and when you ask her when it started, she will pinpoint the day you were a jerk and didn\u2019t want to take her photo (and a good one) on vacation and Italy\u2026 and that will be the day she fell out of love with you.", "NTA. Get her a selfie stick and tell her to have fun.", "Disdain is a very odd emotion to feel about this issue. It also feels like you don\u2019t really want to go on holiday with your wife, preferring to \u2018get lost in your thoughts\u2019 and not liking being interrupted by her presence.\n\nYou don\u2019t respect that she doesn\u2019t like certain photos you take and want them on social media, although you can easily keep candid photos and memories for yourself.\n\nYou supposedly hate the process of photography but \u2018consider yourself a creative\u2019.\n\nYou think the situation, and your wife, is stupid.\n\nYou don\u2019t sound like a good travelling partner, or indeed partner.\n\nYTA", "YTA. You talk about taking a photo, singular, with no effort, and then taking another photo, singular, with begrudging effort\u2026 listen. You can set a limit to something like 3 minutes taking photos and then if she still isn\u2019t satisfied, she can take selfies etc. But I want you to seriously look into yourself and wonder why you\u2019re treating this like a terrible chore when it makes your wife so happy.\n\nOf course it\u2019s annoying to take tons of photos over and over again, but the difference between a bad photo and a good one is massive. It\u2019s pretty sad for her if photos are important to her and you\u2019ve only taken 3 horrible, unfocused photos from awful angles and treated it like torture in the process. This clearly is important to your wife\u2014take a few minutes for each new location to take nice, clear, thoughtful photos, and you will be showing your wife you care about her while barely spending any time yourself on this at all.\n\nAlso, stop posting photos of her without her consent when she\u2019s told you it bothers her.", "Have you had a sit down, heart to heart conversation about this? I couldn\u2019t imagine spending the money to travel and being bitter over picture taking.

I believe pictures are supposed to capture moments, not experiences revolving around pictures. \n\nDefinitely NTA", " NTA. You obviously have different takes on photos. It's not about who's right it's about respecting each other. \n\nI am a woman and I like to take some pics,but I understand my preferences shouldn't make my SO uncomfortable.\n\nIf she wants a full photoshoot she can do that by herself or with some friends. There's also photographer's who need experience and don't charge that much, and she will looove those pics way more that the \"bad\" ones you would take.", "INFO: how many retakes are we talking?\n\nSounds like at the beginning you might have been TA, taking self-admitted low effort pictures, but your wife might also be suffering from Instagram photo blues.\n\nSelfie stick?", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Totally reasonable for you to be annoyed with endless picture taking. But it sounds like your wife is dealing with some classic body image issues if she\u2019s so sensitive to getting a \u201cgood\u201d picture and so upset over candid pictures being posted. I can\u2019t judge her to harshly for that. This selfie/Instagram culture is just fuel for these kind of issues and you can get caught in a cycle where you NEED \u201cgood\u201d pictures to reassure yourself. Especially for those of us seeing the changes of age for the very first time. I would recommend having a talk with her and pointing out her sensitivities to pictures and how she feels about herself right now.

Either do it with a smile, or nip it in the bud once and for all.", ">Photographs are an afterthought - a tool - not the main objective\n\nI like this take, it's a good thing to remember. That being said, NAH. I understand that you wish to live in the moment, and that is completely valid and even admirable in the times we love in. However, I will not judge your wife for wanting to take pictures as well, or not feeling satisfied with her photos; that is how most people are. if she takes 20 of the same place then that certainly is excessive and you should not be forced to participate. But you should also not pass judgement on what she wants. I think it would be best to communicate with each other calmly and invest in a tripod with a remote or something. I have one of those because i love taking multiple photos and the people around me don't, so this tripod solves everything", "You are NTA. Your wife is somewhat of an AH. You both should be enjoying the moment. \n\nHave you asked her if you both enjoy those first moments of the new experience and save the pictures for when you're ready to move on?", "NTA that would irritate me if I was trying to relax", "NTA. I've seen people trapped in this hell and it's not pretty. A constantly dissatisfied partner who's highly anxious about their image (it seems to reach body dysmorphia  level anxiety) and taking it out on their partner.\n\n If I'm you I'm not engaging is this anymore. Make her a promise to get through vacation- you won't post pictures of her period. She can have total editorial control over her image. But in exchange you won't get involved in her photography either. You join her for 3-5 shots if she wants to use a selfie stick but you'll no longer be her photograper. And you both commit to seeing a marriage counselor.\n\nThis would be a deal breaker for me- there's no way in the world I'm living like this.", "NTA But I'm going to give you a blanket bit of advice here. NEVER, ever ever post a picture of someone eating without their explicit permission. If someone posted a picture of me eating ice cream I would literally smother them in their sleep, no one looks good eating ice cream, plus if your wife has any insecurities about her weight she's going to feel like people will judge her just because she's eating something unhealthy.", "NTA. I totally get your point in wanting to only take pictures to capture moments or something interesting or aesthetically pleasing. I have traveled with friends who are always taking videos and pics to post to their stories, and it's even a bit challenging to have a conversation with them in the moment.", "As a female I love having photos taken for memories as one day that's all you'll have left to remind you of good times.. my tip would be to buy her a phone tripod so she can set it up herself and snap away.. it's what I do then everyone gets what they want, she gets as many photos as she wants and it doesnt irrate you.. I have a tripod with a little remote connected via bluetooth it's very effective", "NTA, OP\n\nI am a well-traveled international traveler and people like her annoy tf out of me. Sounds like your wife is a wannabe influencer. Just another tourist who doesn't actually care about the experience and monopolizes a spot in a popular tourist destination to have their own personal photoshoot for an hour, nevermind other people also want photos in that spot and you are being a rude A-hole taking up the space.

She\u2019s literally ruining what should be a wonderful time for you Over a fake photo.  Why do I say fake because she looks great but her man is starting to resent and like her less.  That\u2019s how relationships slowly die.  Hate to be dramatic but resentment is a relationship poison.   Also, you hate/don\u2019t take good photos.  So girl wants a husband or a selfie stick?!?", "NTA and this speaks to a larger issue - your values. Sounds like you value experiences wheras she values appearances.", "NTA but I gotta admit it feels very hard for me to see things from your wife's position. I like photography so I will spend a lot of time taking pictures - but never of myself. But I have a friend who has the same huge selfie obsession and I almost went crazy on our last weekend trip... I swear I have more selfies from those three days than from my backbacking trip over four months and yeah... I can't deal with that.\n\nBut when I think of that friend and try to be empathetic: I guess your wife is one of those people who sees photography as documentation - not a hobby or art form. It seems incredibly important to her to document literally every spot we've been to and in my opinion it can turn into a bit of an obsession. I guess social media and modern technology (always having your phone with you) doesn't help. I don't really have good advice for you, only that when I think of my friend, the selfies really are that important to her that she was legit hurt when I got cranky about it (although she also got impatient and cranky when I didn't cooperate).\n\nYou can only try to explain your stance to your wife, telling her that this need of having the perfect picture of every spot you visit is stressing you out and asking her to find a compromise. Maybe reduce the number of pictures to five sightseeing spots a day and maybe another three pretty spots you walk past on accident.", "NTA but tell her to take photos of you all day and let\u2019s see how she feels. The obsession with pictures nowadays is crazy. She should stop being selfish and focus on enjoying the vacation.", "NTA, why don't you just let her know you can take 3 photos (with effort), and that's that.

However, if your wife is having problems that are causing her to compulsively photograph herself over and over, then this is something she needs to talk to someone about.\n\nIt seems like you two need to have a conversation and work out what is essential to each of you and what can be compromised on, there's lots of good ideas in the comments.

So 1-ask your wife what she normally is conscious about in photos (maybe it\u2019s her arms, or she likes a certain side of her face better). 2- ask your wife what angles in photos she feels the most confident in. Ask her to show you her favourite photos of herself and look at her pose and angle of the camera (is it far away? Full body? On an angle?)\n3- take some time and practice with this new info casually at home.

And the problem is that he acts all mighty and superior about the whole thing. Like she is stupid for wanting pictures. For me the wife notices this attitude and tries to compensate by asking gazillion pictures. I think it is wrong of her to do that. At the same time with modern gadgets I can easily take 20 pics of a person like in 20 secs or less, so it makes me think he really makes no effort, and she realizes and it hurts her and she doesn't know how to react and she is acting like an ah.\n\nFor me the major Ah is OP though. He needs to stop acting like he is a superior being because he prefers to be in the moment. I mean he is not, is he? If he was in the moment with his wife he would realize that taking a picture is something that she enjoys on a trip and he would like to enjoy that with her. They could arrive to a compromise, he could make an actual effort and stop acting superior. I think that superiority is what making her act that way.\n\nESH. For me she is an AH to herself for keep trying when you don't give a damn, and to you  because you dont give a damn. But you are the biggest ah. You are not the owner of the truth, and God forbid your wife dying, but you might learn to appreciate the pictures if that happens. In any case you don't need to ever like pictures, you just need to respect she does and you could learn to talk and respect her that way you can arrive to a compromise. You talk like she is a moron for liking pictures, you act that way, can you realize how that would upset her? Also for her is important what pictures of her are in social media, respect that.\n\nAnd a word of advice, if you are taking just 1 picture each time is why you always fail, take several in one shot, that way she has more options.

I'll do my best to stay out of folk's shots, but at some point, it's just bad manners, and I should get my chance to take a look without waiting forever.  And in many cases, they could've gotten a more interesting shot by just stepping to the side.\n\nSure, snapshots are great.  But sitting there for five minutes to get the perfect shot is kind of ridiculous.  It'll be just as fun looking back on a half-assed shot as the perfectly-framed picture that took five minutes and 50 separate tries.\n\nIf you're a serious photographer, show up at 8am, before the rest of us, to get your perfect shot.  Or stay late, after the rest of us are gone.", "Exactly. I see so many people claiming the wife is vain or a \u2018wannabe influencer\u2019 (as if wanting to take nice photos on vacation is some newfangled social media side effect). People have had family photo albums since photography has been invented. I love being able to look at old photos of my parents traveling (or even just hanging out) when they were younger. Our family has several albums and I truly cherish being able to look at them.", "I have one of these, just a cheap one from Amazon and it works really well! Me and my friends make sure to bring it to all parties now to get some funny pics lmao", "Not really when you\u2019ve been with a person for 8 years. I post pics of my Bf without telling him and he finds out when he gets tagged in them. It\u2019s a sweet gesture that shows you like the person you\u2019re with.", "Ok, this comment made me laugh. Clearly you do not have a partner, family, kids.", "That is such a good point. Never thought about it that way. Although i guess the candid Pics would still be more interesting than the perfect ones down the road. But yes landscapes and such better enjoyed in the Moment than photographed a million times", "Yeah I do regret not thinking about taking more sometimes, but I was just stating as someone who barely thinks about it being hounded for \"the perfect picture\" would set me off. But my partner is actually the chill one, he knows that as long as we have a plan for food we will have a good time \ud83d\ude06 pictures or not", "I\u2019ve went with a friend who was like this about her pictures, and I was the one taking them, it is extremely frustrating.", "So what the OP described is normal to you? Cause that's what I'm saying.  That I PERSONALLY don't take a lot of selfies and I don't mind taking pictures of my partner, but if they want me to keep retaking them over and over I would refuse at a point. Click click here's the pic, not good enough too bad.", "Berating your partner for not taking a \u201cgood\u201d photo is certainly excessive\u2026", "I\u2019ve always read it in my head as Everyone\u2019s shit here. Strange. Thanks for explaining!", "He\u2019s allowed to think it sucks to have to interrupt his experience to take dozens of pictures.  Despite that, he said he was taking her direction and making an effort to take good pictures, and she still tells him she thinks his pictures are ugly.", "Yeah because she IS shallow, berating him when she doesn\u2019t like how SHE looks in pictures and demanding an excessive amount of their vacation time be spent on her photo shoots. It\u2019s ridiculously self absorbed.", "I understand what you\u2019re saying - but then we could flip it around also.  It\u2019s important for the husband to be able to take the sights in and enjoy them also.  The experience he\u2019s looking for is not the same as hers.  \n\nThis seems much more like an ESH - they just don\u2019t seem like compatible travel partners.", "Yikes! Is there a limit to what is required and expected in relationships according to you? I can imagine some people might find these steep expectations a deal breaker.", "What the hell is this comment? Lol", "Based on the comments here sounds like lots of people are in relationships with narcissists.", "But aphantasia can't possibly require that the person be in every single f-ing photo.", "Yeah, that's probably it. No way it could be anything waaaay more likely", "He literally said the exact opposite? Besides, if he knew taking bad pictures would mean arguing and further photography, why would he do it?", "He then went on to say that he does indeed try to take good photos, and those are the ones she calls ugly.\n\nShe's a huge asshole.", "Agreed. It can take a lot of time to take a good photo and if if she is that particular then it basically becomes a photoshoot. OP is NTA for sure, she sounds like an insufferable traveling partner.", "I think he posted this in the heat of the moment, which is making him sound dismissive. I think at this point he's just so done with it. I know I would be.", "That's where limits and boundaries come in. Two people can come from two different points of view and meet somewhere in the middle. If you *can't* do that, then yea, even something silly like taking photos can be a deal breaker. But if you're digging your heels in on 0 photos and saying even wanting photos of yourself is stupid (refusal and judgements), yea, you're the AH.", "Yeah I'd be so frustrated doing this for just a year. Imagine a lifetime. No wonder OP snapped", "Tourists take pictures. It comes with the territory. The colosseum has more than enough spots to admire it from, if someone taking pictures in your general proximity annoys you that much you are free to move to a different spot.", "Yeah that was with film camera so you had to make it count. I have no problem taking a phot or two. I have an issue when I take several then my photography skills critiqued then I take several more", "That\u2019s fine because you know he doesn\u2019t mind, but she is actively asked to approve photos posted of her and he should respect that.", "His wife has expressed that she doesn't like it multiple times. Ignoring that is not a sweet gesture it's horrible. Just because you like to do something doesn't make it sweet", "My husband and I have been together for over 10 years. I don\u2019t even share photos of him on my very private instagram without checking with him first, he rarely uses social media. I even check with him before I send photos of him with our child to his mum, and she certainly isn\u2019t expecting every photo to be \u2018perfect\u2019. \n\nIt\u2019s not hard to ask and respect that your partner may do a few things differently to you", "I've been with my partner for 20 years and I always ask his permission before posting any photo of him. It's not hard, he's literally right there. If your partner gives you carte blanche, fine, but that's not a universal love language.", ">Not really when you\u2019ve been with a person for 8 years. \n\nTime together \u2260 consent\n\nSeriously, apply that thinking to any other scenario (eg sex). Consent, as a concept/principle is *dynamic*. OP is definitely an AH for posting someone else's image on social media without that person's consent. Period.\n\nWife is also being inconsiderate when it comes to taking photos, so it's definitely an ESH situation.", "I agree, this idea that you're going to ask permission to post an innocuous photo of your spouse is silly.", "True, not many ppl here commenting seem to care about OPs experience, just that his wife deserves all these photos of HERSELF on their vacation. I realize I'm definitely in the minority but I find this need to be in every photo so gauche.", "Yeah I suspect that people who insist on taking pictures over and over again are probably doing them more for social media than memories.", "My SO and I are like this. We used to fight all the time.\n\nOur compromise has been that he takes a bunch of pics of me in front of whatever vacation, tourist, interesting spot and later I look through them and pick out the best one. Not while we are actively at the spot so it doesn't distract from the experience as OP mentioned.\n\nIf none of the photos turned out, ah well. \n\nSome people who grew up in this digital age don't appreciate how good they have it. Back in the day, you only had like 24 photos on a roll of film and you hoped for the best lol", "No but perhaps I misunderstood your point before. It seemed like you were saying there shouldn\u2019t be so much focus on pictures on vacation and I disagreed. But seems that\u2019s not quite what you meant.", "20 photos can be snapped in less than 40 seconds tho lol. But I do get your point. With live photos, she should be able to find something useable of those 20+", "In that case ESH applies to the entire world, lol", "I would like to refer you back to my original comment and specifically the meaning of ESH", "He never specified a time, she could be asking for 5-10 minutes a day. And it's not self absorbed to want photos of yourself on vacation, some people just love making memories that way.", "It\u2019s misogyny.", "Same goes for comments on Reddit. If it annoys you so much you are free to move to another sub.", "Exactly, if I know the person usually minds/ is peculiar about photos, then I wouldn't post then without asking them.", "True true", "She did not. She likes taking photos, and he thought the photos were beautiful. How often does she post photos of him without consulting him first? He's only done it a couple of times, and each time from the sounds of it, he took her criticisms and tried to post a better one next time. It seems like she needs therapy about her weirdness about photos.", "Where does it say that in the post?", "My partner is not too keen on photos on social media as well so I either ask him or mask his face with an emoji, which became somewhat of a game now. I would love to post more pics of him as he's beautiful but what can you do? He doesn't want his face to be seen that often so there's that.", "You\u2019re being ridiculous and no functional marriage requires individual consent for ever posting anything about your partner. The level of false equivalence here is astounding.", "This is not equivalent to sex, but good on you for making false equivalences. Do you not have family members that post pics of you from holiday get togethers? Does every photo of you on the internet have your confirmation prior to being posted? \n\nIdk maybe I just have a big family and a partner who doesn\u2019t mind being posted in a loving way on the internet.", "Man. There was nothing worse than getting back an entire thing of pictures and they were all blurry. \ud83d\ude2d Like damn I spent 10$ on NOTHING \ud83d\ude06", "I\u2019m the same way! Also if there\u2019s a long line or something, he snaps three to five MAX and we keep it moving. If I don\u2019t like them, tough shit. Other people are waiting to take a photo", "excellent compromise!", "They meant that the wife's obsession with the photograph being perfect over enjoying the vacation is ruining the trips because she is more worried about something she is seeing in the photos.", "And if he takes those 20 photos in 40 seconds, she then reviews all of them, and if she doesn't like them asks for more to be taken. I'd be on your side if it was snapshot and move on but OP clearly stated there's a review process, and then more photos, and so on. \n\nI love my husband but I would absolutely not waste significant portions of my vacation taking the same photo over and over again. Vacations shouldn't feel like you're filming a documentary of your spouse. Instagram culture is wild.", "Eh, I really depends on the photographer. If someone is particularly inept, it might take a lot of shots and feedback to get a single okay photo.", "It\u2019s more than 5-10 minutes if she wants numerous pictures, reviews and complains about each single one and demands retakes, then reviews and complains and demands more retakes. And yes, it IS self absorbed to demand this type of perfection and behave this way for every damn picture while KNOWING she\u2019s shitting on what\u2019s important to him on these trips.", "I can honestly picture the whole scene in my head. Him just quickly snapping a picture of her before she\u2019s ready, \u201cthere ya go\u201d and gaslighting her that he\u2019s so much better than her because she actually cares that the picture isn\u2019t good and wants it done again. \n\nTake a good effen picture of your wife!", "Of course it would be misogynistic! Thus the sarcasm. My point was that she\u2019s ridiculous.", "I don\u2019t have to move to another sub just because I disagree with your view lol", ">You\u2019re being ridiculous and no functional marriage requires individual consent for ever posting anything about your partner\n\nMaybe just take a step back and realise the rest of us aren't *you*? There are hundreds of *very good reasons* why people don't want their image on social media (e.g. domestic violence victims, police and their families not wanting criminals to learn who they are and where they live, people wanting to keep their private life *private*, and some people *just don't like their photo being online*).\n\nHonestly, grow up.\n\n*ETA: if you put everything about you and your loved ones on social media, you're a much easier target for identity fraud* \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Ridiculous and taking their argument to the most extreme scenario to prove they are right.", "Right? Thank you", "Maybe that sounds like bs but I think it's a little different. If you take pictures with family it is implied that you agree to them being posted, if you don't agree then you don't pose in the picture, simple as that. Of course people share those photos. Taking a picture of your wife fixing your glasses is more intimate than a family photo.", ">This is not equivalent to sex, but good on you for making false equivalences\n\nThe topic is *consent*, the principle of which is the same in *every* situation, which was my point. If you believe that consent is *implied* in *any* situation \"just because you've been together a long time\", then you really need to go back to the drawing board and reflect on the meaning of the word. If someone drinks a cup of tea every day, are you not going to ask before you make them one? \n\n>Do you not have family members that post pics of you from holiday get togethers? Does every photo of you on the internet have your confirmation prior to being posted? \n\nNo, I don't. Not without my consent, and vice versa. I also have my social media specifically set to require my consent when I'm tagged in something, so that I can *choose* whether I want to be tagged, and simultaneously have the option to ask that person to that the photo down.\n\nWe also have a generation of kids (starting from today's teens) who have grown up with their face plastered on social media by their parents from the moment they were born. And that's not fair to them in the slightest. They had *no choice*. And in a time when we are trying to teach people to respect bodily autonomy (eg women's rights in multiple countries), we *have* to start to properly understanding consent.", "> Do you not have family members that post pics of you from holiday get togethers?\n\nno\n\n>Does every photo of you on the internet have your confirmation prior to being posted?\n\nyes", "Or one of your fingers eclipsed the lens and cut 2 out 5 people from a group photo.", "Yeah if this is a case of weaponized incompetence it's a great example of why it's so commonly used to manipulate. If he's intentionally taking shit pictures to make her stop asking him, he's putting her in an impossible situation. She either folds to the manipulation or asks him to do it again, which gives him an excuse to escalate his annoyance & paint her as unreasonable. On its face \"berating him for not taking good enough pictures\" makes her sound crazy, but if he's fucking them up to manipulate her out of something she likes multiple times and refusing to interact with her in good faith, of course she's going to be upset. He's *trying to upset her* so he can be the victim. It would take much less time to just actively participate, and there would be no conflict.", "Is it free to move? because now you've changed it to have to move.", "But she's already posting pics of the trip and them, I can see where he might think it was okay to post too. Good for the goose is good for the gander and all that.", "Lmao @ \"the rest of us.\" You're in the minority on your inane ramblings and projection on this one chief.", "Lol. Here's another one then:\n\nJust because a person has been fine with a particular photo of them being uploaded in the past, doesn't automatically mean they are fine with a new photo being posted *now*.\n\nThere can be multiple reasons for this change in consent, all of them valid, and they don't owe anyone an explanation. \"No\" is a complete sentence.", "Yeah but I\u2019m not talking about posed photos, I\u2019m talking about candid photos that you don\u2019t know are being taken until they are posted. It\u2019s fun to look back and see everyone hanging out or just being themselves. My Aunt always takes a bunch of those types of photos at family get-togethers.", "Yepppp", "Sorry, let me correct this then: I *won\u2019t* move to another sub just because I disagree with your view :)", "Not everyone likes their candid photos though. He said he\u2019ll post pictures of her eating ice cream or fixing her glasses.", ">But she's already posting pics of the trip and them\n\nOP never said this (unless they've deleted comments that I haven't seen). \n\nRegardless, my judgement was ESH.
