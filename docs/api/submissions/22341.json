I hadn\u2019t seen them in a while and we planned on grabbing dinner and catching up. As we were about to sit down, i get a call from my friend \u201cMolly\u201d (27F). Her car broke down about 2 miles from her house and she needed a ride. \n\nSome context real quick- Molly recently bought a new car and it\u2019s had NOTHING but problems. I am Molly\u2019s only friend in the area (the rest moved away) & she has no family nearby. I have come to her rescue more times than I can count. I\u2019ve left work to jump start her car, take her to service centers, airport, etc. so many times. I\u2019ve never once asked Molly for gas money or anything, but she\u2019s also never offered (despite the fact that she makes great money- she\u2019s just very, very frugal). Instead of taking a $9 Uber, she\u2019ll ask me to drive her, which is FINE\u2026 but it would be nice if she offered to reimburse me (even though I would decline it, it\u2019s the thought that counts).\n\nANYWAY- Molly was about 10 minutes from me and I asked her how I could help. She said \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do? Can you give me a ride?\u201d I told Molly that she\u2019d need to call a tow truck and I was just sitting down for dinner. Molly asked if I could leave dinner to come get her. She was in town, in a safe area during daylight and only about 2 miles from her home (which is a $10 Uber). She was pulled off to the side & wasn\u2019t on a super busy road. I told Molly that I hadn\u2019t seen my in laws in a while and since this wasn\u2019t an emergency, I would come when I was done eating if that was okay. She had to wait for a tow truck anyway which could be an hour or two.\n\nMolly started crying and was telling me she really needed me and had nobody else. \n\nI told Molly that I could quickly come get her & bring her home, and we could call a tow after dinner\u2026 but I couldn\u2019t wait for a tow truck. Molly said she needed to stay with her car and didn\u2019t want to leave it. I was really trying to be accommodating without bailing on my in-laws, but eventually Molly just said \u201cforget it. I\u2019ll figure it out\u201d. Then she hung up. \n\nI was a little perturbed because it\u2019s not like I\u2019m always dropping my plans to help her with her car?? Also, this wasn\u2019t an emergency! She was right down the road from her house, in a non-busy SAFE area in the middle of the day! Why do I need to sit with her for an hour while the tow truck shows up?? \nBut, I can\u2019t help but feel a little guilty. I know she probably needed moral support but I can\u2019t help feeling like she wanted to save $10 on an Uber since she\u2019s very frugal.", "created_utc": 1689457903, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150o581/aita_for_not_leaving_dinner_with_my_in_laws_to/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

One correction, though. Molly is *not* frugal. Molly is cheap.

I can\u2019t conceive of leaving work or a dinner or any event at all to pick someone up because their car broke down unless it was a legitimate emergency. I can\u2019t conceive of ever asking anyone to do that for me unless I was actually unsafe.", "NtA. You're making her issue into your issue. She wants to save 10 dollars and doesn't want to sit alone and wait for a tow truck all sound like a HER problem.", " Think of it this way: If you are always at her beck & call, you'll always be at her beck & call.\n\n  You offered to pick her up, but she only wanted you there to do it *her way.* You did not, and she was on her own to fix it. Good.", "You feel guilty because she is your friend.  But what you just did was set some boundaries on what you are willing to do.  She very well may still have the car because she knows you are always on call to help when it breaks down.  \n\nNTA - You made sure she was close to home, in a safe area, during daylight hours, gave advice to call the tow truck and even offered to come after dinner.
