She is the entitled one. Cut it when and if you want. Don\u2019t respond to her at all about it. She CAN cut it herself or hire it out. Plenty of senior citizens cut their own lawn.  You are a better person than I am because if she said that to me I would never cut her grass again. What she is really mad about is that you dare put your family ahead of her.", "Nta.

She has no idea how fortunate she is to have you help her. At some point, stop asking, simply inform and do. \nMy experience with my aging parents is that they are clinging to independence through attempts to control little situations like this. Aging is difficult and so is helping aging parents while taking care of your own life. Once I started ignoring the little digs and demands, I felt better and got more done for them on my own schedule.", "NTA, you are huge free help for her and do everything in your free time instead of getting rest from your work and other responsibilities.

If not, is there something else that's going on in her life that's causing her stress?", "NTA: If she wants it done on her schedule she can hire a professional and dictate the day and time.\n\nYou are doing this because you are a loving son. She should be flexible.", "How old is your mom? I'm old enough to have a 30 year old son and I can mow my own lawns.

Nope.  What can she do?", "NTA, Doing someone a favour on your terms is absolutely fine, especially if you've explained why.\n\nWhat I can't tell is the age group your mum falls into.
