I bought the second car around the time my oldest son, Hector, turned sixteen. I put my son on the insurance for car 1, but not car 2, and told him he can drive car 1 as much as he wants (within reason) but not to touch car 2 (because he isn't on the insurance). Last year I used car 1 to teach my second son, David, how to drive, because, again, I don't want them driving car two.\n\nHector was mad I taught David to drive on car 1, because he said it was \"his\" car. I said it definitely wasn't. It's my car, and he and his brother can both drive it, but it's not his. Hector said it wasn't fair, and ever since David turned sixteen, they have fought constantly over car 1. I'm so sick of it. I said they need to work this out, because they are both too old to act like children.\n\nYesterday David complained that Hector was hiding the car keys in his room. I told Hector to get the keys, and he said he wanted to use the car later, so David can't take the car. I said it doesn't work like that. If you aren't using the car, David can use it. Hector said David needs to get used to not having the car, because he'll be leaving for college soon.\n\nI told Hector that he's not taking my car with him to college. Hector was furious and asked what I was going to do with it. I said I'm going to use it to teach my youngest, Lewis, to drive, like I did Hector and David, and David and Lewis will share the car until David moves out. Hector isn't taking it.\n\nHector was furious and said as the oldest he has the most right to the car. He said he'll need one at school. I said he can buy one then. Hector said I'm ruining his life and locked himself in his room.\n\nFrom the time Hector was 16-18 he had a car available for his use. How is it fair if I do that for him and not his brothers? It's not right for me to give any of them a car unless I can give all of them a car. Just because Hector is older why should he have special privileges?\n\nAITA for not giving my son this car?", "created_utc": 1671148557, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zn0isr/aita_for_not_letting_my_son_take_this_car_to/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like that\u2019s what you\u2019ve tried to do with car 1. Maybe try explaining it that way to hector. That it\u2019s not his car it\u2019s the kids car for him and his siblings.

Tell Hector I said \"welcome to adulthood \"", "NTA - It is your car and it makes sense that you would have one for the kids to share. As for your oldest going to college, many schools in the States either don\u2019t allow freshman to have cars or make them prohibitively expensive with high parking fees. Before he assumes he can have a car, he needs to see how things work at his university. My kid is at a school where few have cars because parking is too expensive, but there is an excellent city run bus system that is free for students.", "NTA.  \nWe have purchased starter cars for each of our children for their 16th birthday.  They are in our names, but there are gifts so as adults we are happy to transfer the title if and when requested.  It does not sound as if you made the same promise to your oldest.

NAH it's all too normal.", "NTA as far as the car being yours.  You are TA expecting them to work out who uses the car when especially since Hector thinks he\u2019s entitled to sole use.  You need to work out a schedule for the use of the car.  Quite frankly the way Hector is behaving I\u2019d be tempted to take it from him, but that would just make him worse.

OP is n t a for not giving Hector the car or for using it to teach their other kids to drive and giving them the same opportunities OP gave Hector.\n\nBut I would say OP is an AH for failing to properly explain the situation to Hector in the first place and for not mediating this situation when it could potentially lead to permanent damage to OP's relationship with their kids (or at least Hector) and Hector's relationship with his brothers.", "NTA. He is lucky you got him a car at all.....remind him of how many kids had to work and buy their own cars.", "This. \n \nBut also adding that you leaving it up to them to solve it between them is making this whole problem worse. They\u2019re not adults they\u2019re still teenagers, and it appears you haven\u2019t given them enough of an idea on how you expect this to work for them to handle it. You should be mediating these arguments.", "Yes. \n\nIt should have been outlined so Hector had two years to plan how he would get himself a car!", "Right he assumed it was his car then wouldnt ever care withe the problem every child was gonna get a car everytime some was leaving for school, hector is creating problems with his assumptions", "I feel like you probably explained the situation better than OP. NTA but these issues should\u2019ve been resolved before the 2nd oldest was old enough to drive, or better yet when the oldest first started to drive.
