On Monday, it was Jens' wedding with her high school sweetheart Tom(22M) and a bit of drama went down which had caused me to stay at my grandparents'(60F&M). A bit of backstory: Tom used to have a crush on Ann in high school, but Ann rejected him. Jen started tutoring Tom a year later and they soon fell in love. My parents have always said that Tom settled for Jen, which deeply upsets Jen, but Tom always denies it and resures Jen. Tom had recently proposed to Jen and the whole family was there. My parents made a comment again, saying how Jen was lucky Tom decided to settle for her. Ann laughed it off and agreed. Jen said nothing. I was a bridesmaid and Ann was not, which started another fight within the family for obvious reasons. Which brings us to Monday. The wedding went smoothly and we all had a great time until the reception. The parents of the bride and groom were to give a speech about the couple. Tom's dad gave a very funny speech about Tom and his first \u201cgirlfriend\u201d (who was his teddy bear girlfriend) and how they are happy he fell for such a great woman like Jen, which brings us to my dad. My dad didn\u2019t say much and, of course, brought up how Jen was always the \u201cugly duckling\u201d and Ann was always the \u201cswan princess\u201d. After the speeches, I walked in on Jen bawling her eyes out in the bathroom with Toms' mom and her bridesmaids. Here is where I might be the asshole. A few minutes later, I picked up the microphone and I decided to make some jokes with my family and Tom's family. I took this as an opportunity to insult Ann's dress(for anyone wondering it was red), her mistreatment of me and Jen and how she\u2019ll always be a bridesmaid and never the bride. At the time, nobody had a problem with this and found my jokes funny, but Ann was extremely mad. This cheered Jen up and I felt happy. After the wedding, Jen permanently cut my parents off and when we went home, my parents packed my things for me and kicked me out. They told me they didn\u2019t want to see me anymore. Ann has taken to social media to mock me and my appearance and say she\u2019s happy I\u2019m out of her life. My friends say I\u2019m an asshole for doing that publicly, so AITA? I don\u2019t think I am, but I\u2019d like other people's opinions.\n\n\nEDIT: I keep seeing people say how Ann should of stuck up for Jen and how Ann wasn\u2019t the one making those comments about Jen. Yes she has. Ann has flirted with every guy Jen has dated, makes rude comments towards us about our looks and most importantly of all makes that comment about how Tom asked her out first. Tom was like 16 at the time and he just randomly approached her at the locker\u2019s saying \u201cwanna go out some time?\u201d It wasn\u2019t this big thing like she claims it was.\n\nANOTHER EDIT: Jen and Tom broke up quite a few times but always found their way back to each other.", "created_utc": 1679083050, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11u1x0d/aita_for_insulting_my_sister_on_my_other_sisters/", "score": 192, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
