She is my life and I treat her like my baby. \n\nI had a friend (27m) whom I was super close with in my teens, but we grew apart because I pulled away for my mental well-being. Long story short, a (grown ass) friend of his (who was the older sister of my ex-best friend) began spreading nasty rumours about me which would have been pretty damaging to my image (had it been believable) and he did nothing to stop her.\n\nSafe to say we lost touch and only began talking again after he found out I adopted a cat as well. He and I stayed in touch through cat memes only, and a few months ago, his cat sadly passed away. I tried my best to be there for him throughout. \n\nA week ago, I put up a picture of my cat (along with my hand) on my story with a sarcastic comment that she was up for 'adoption' because she scratched me. \n\nHe messaged me saying he was actually interested and that he had hoped I would give him my cat without him having to ask me, but since I didn't offer, he was waiting for the right time.\n\nI told him no, of course, and even stated that I thought it was very obvious that I was, in fact, being sarcastic. A lot of my friends sent me laughing emojis and he was the only one who thought I was being serious. I told him that I thought he knew I would NEVER even dream about giving her away.\n\nHe called me insensitive and demanded that I \"owe\" him a cat for getting his expectations all high only to let him down.

You owe him a cat? That's super weird and go ahead and drift apart from this guy again.

Seriously. \n\nFAR away!!!", "NTA. That dude and his friends are weird.", "WTF\u2014?! NTA. \n\nThere are so many cats looking for homes right now and incredibly affordable. Tell him to get his own damn cat.", "NTA. I can see you friend wanting to adopt another cat. But there is no shortage of cats out there to be adopted.

Your cat, you are not responsible for how he interpreted that post of yours!!", "Idk why are you even asking. NTA at all. That \"friend\" of yours just proved that he's a big AH.. You \"owe\" him nothing, specially a cat. Its not your fault his cat died, you didn't killed him.... And that's a proof that you need to pull him away again for the rest of your life. He's just seems toxic and so entitled\nRUN! Run from that's \"friend\" as fast as you can and never go back!", "???\nObviously NTA?", "You are NTA for not letting a now former \"friend\" adopt your cat", "Lol, NTA, block him and his gf and move on with your life like nothing's happened. You don't owe him anything. The mental gymnastics he had to pull to even think you should have offered your cat after his died is mind-blowing.", "NTA They sound unhinged.", "NTA", "NTA. Ask him if he would've given away his previous cat.", "OP, you're \"friends\" with Mr Heckles. \n\n\n\"You owe me a cat.\"", "Okay, this guy has clearly got something else going on to believe that you \"owe him a cat\". My gods, this is deranged behaviour!! I'd be taking several giant steps back from him and not let him anywhere near my cat. Or his girlfriend fir that matter. \n\nNTA", "NTA. There's absolutely no reason why he'd be entitled to your cat because he misunderstood a joke. \n\nIt seems like he showed his true colours as a 'friend' to you previously, so looks like drifting apart again would be a healthy option", "NTA \n\nYou pulled away from this friend before for a good reason and he had never reached out to you until he wanted something. I\u2019m sure well before his cat died he wanted yours since in the post he\u2019s been waiting. You don\u2019t owe him anything. If he continues asking you for your cat again then just go no contact again.", "Narcissists are so weird.", "NTA he\u2019s not your friend. Block this asshole and forget about him.", "NTA. This person is not your friend. Cut them out of your life.", "NTA. Keep away from this guy. He sounds unstable. Joking about putting a feline baby up for adoption after being scratched is not unusual and knowing how much you love your baby, he should have known that you weren\u2019t serious. You owe him nothing. He is very immature for his age and he is not your friend.", "NTA, he's a complete idiot!", "NTA of course. Your cat is yours, you don\u2019t own him a thing. If he wants a cat he can just go to a rescue center and offer a better life to one.", "NTA", "NTA, obviously", "Nta. Just cut this drama out of your life though. Block him and go nc", "It was a joke. Animal lovers make that joke. Parents make that joke. I think my first was 2-3 yo and build a stair contraption in her room to get things she shouldn\u2019t. I took a picture and offered her up. It\u2019s a standard joke. NTA.", "NTA, this guy is really weird, and of course it was obvious you didn't mean it for real to give the cat away (a kiss for the cat please :D)   \nyou don't owe anyone anything - except, to block such people. them causing drama is such a waste of time.", "NTA. What the hell?? You don't \"owe\" him a cat; it's understandable that he's grieving, but you shouldn't have to make a sacrifice for his sake.", "Did you kill his cat? I\u2019m assuming the answer is no, so no, you don\u2019t \u201cowe\u201d him a cat.

He said he wasn't ready. This was a week ago.", "I have been contemplating putting a distance between us again, mainly because I am still not over how he used to call me his best friend only to not have my back. But this just had me speechless.", "I have him (and his girlfriend) blocked as of now because he kept blowing my phone up.", "Do I even need to say, NTA? \n\nKeep your cat away from him, of course -- and avoid contact. He already showed you who he was, in the past.", "thank you for responding!", "There you go. I think he has an issue with you to be honest. Cut him out of your life, I don\u2019t think it will be too much of a loss!", "Yeesh...so was asking to take your cat his weird ass way of trying to get back in touch? Because that's a hell of a stupid way to try and rekindle a friendship.", "Is your cat some cool color or longhaired or something? Maybe he's vain like that and wants your cat instead of a \"boring-looking\" kitten?", "Oh lts a completely ridiculous request and I would be shocked too!", "Put some country miles between you two. He's unhinged. Nta", "Good job!  You don't need people like that in your life."]}
