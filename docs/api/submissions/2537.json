NTA", "They\u2019re also a lot of work \n\nI mean the friend is an AH but I can see why people decline kittens even if they\u2019re cute af", "Does he have personality disorders or brain trauma or something? Because that's fucking bonkers. NTA.", "NTA. He\u2019s a lunatic. Block him.", "Ummm, what? NTA! I\u2019m sure there are a ton of shelters, with a ton of cats, that are just waiting to be adopted by anyone, even someone as delusional as your \u201cfriend\u201d. \n\nTime to cut that contact again and this time for good!", "NTA, this person doesn\u2019t sound like a friend at all.", "NTA why is this even in question. it's your cat, you don't 'owe' anyone anything.", "NTA. Block him and go no contact.", "NTA! Your friend is deranged! Go NC, block him, and anyone who thinks you should give him your car. \n\nI\u2019ve lost beloved pets but this is beyond grief. This is entitled assholery and deranged fuckery!", "NTA. Send him a link to a cat adoption website and then block him", "NTA and what was the guy 6 years older than you doing hanging out with teenagers?", "This man has issues. Why does he want YOUR cat? So effing weird. NTA.", "Block him. He\u2019s nuts.", "Like, how many stray animals are there. If he really wants a cat, he can easily find one I\u2019m sure. Why does he need YOUR cat? It\u2019s weird.", "Cat tax, pls?", "What teen has a best friend that's 6 years their junior? And then starts trying to pull this weird manipulative crap on ANYONE, let alone that person, when they're almost 30 goddam years old? \n\nBlock this person on every single platform. Tell any mutual you have that he is no longer welcome in your life. What a creep.", "Oh woah wait yeah.\n\nThis guy was friends with OP's best friend's OLDER SISTER, and now X years later he's pulling this shit? Uh-uh. Red flag city.", "NTA", "Y T A, OP. Everyone knows there are only two cats in the world. And now there is only one.\n\nNTA, of course. Your \"friend\" is being weird. I put friend in quotes because he's not really doing a terrific job of clearing incredibly low bars like \"don't demand my friend's pet\" and \"don't sic my girlfriend on my friend just because they didn't say yes to something I wanted.\"", "NTA x 1000 In what world do you owe someone your cat cause it\u2019s not earth", "nta and I am concerned that this guy is going to steal your cat.", "Stay away from him, this seems like just a power trip and you don\u2019t need him or his creepy gf in your life", ">  because I am still not over how he used to call me his best friend only to not have my back.\n\nBased on the ages, I'm guessing you're still not the age he was when he met you (or if you are, this whole thing is creepier than I think it is). People that age who bond with someone younger like that aren't a true friend -- they want something, whether it's physical or a therapist or a confidence post or maybe even a cat.", "NTA - it was a joke. That guy needs therapy.", "KEEP. RECEIPTS. and a close eye on your cat. \n\nNTA for the reasons everyone has provided.", "NTA, he obviously has issues he doesn't seem to want to work through.", "NTA. That's super weird that he didn't know you were joking! And then to say you got his hopes up so you owe him a cat? And his GF got involved. They are super weird. Time to block and move on. What is he adding to your life?", "Nta he was probably the one spreading the rumors.  Never ever ever get back together with any ex friends unless the parting was because of moving.", "NTA.", "I jokingly tell my friends I\u2019m putting my boyfriend up for adoption when he\u2019s annoying me. He does the same when I\u2019m annoying him. NTA.", "NTA. I can\u2019t see a scenario where you are the AH as you were clearly joking and you didn\u2019t reach out to him and offer - he asked! \n\nEven if he doesn\u2019t read social cues well that alone shows you did not set up his expectations - he set his own up. \n\nDistance, space, and a real re-consideration of this friendship is 100% warranted. Stay safe.", "That guy screams unhinged danger. Stay away for sure", "NTA - time for this \u201cfriend\u201d to no longer be in your life.  No one sane that has a pet would even make such a demand.  Get rid of this crazy.", "He is not your friend. He is an entitled snowflake who will always put his \"wants\" before you or anyone else or any animal's care. Drop this loser asap - find a decent friend. NTA", "The thing here is that Op he wants your cat , not any other. This friend honestly sounds like bad news.", "Nta. Block him on everything.", "Friends. Mr Heckles \"you owe me a cat\"", "NTA at all! A pet is a family member. I can\u2019t believe he would even ask, much less have the audacity to essentially demand.\n\nAlso, just based on your ages and the fact that you\u2019ve been friends since you were a teen, I don\u2019t think this is someone you want to have around. Like, was he 20 when you were 14? Because that\u2019s not an appropriate age gap to have. If you were 18 or 19 when you were friends that\u2019s a bit different, but this doesn\u2019t sound like that. \n\nI guess I\u2019m saying just be careful. He seems a bit unhinged.", "I've had people threaten to steal my cats, and others who have threatened to steal my sons when they were babies. I've threatened to put my cats for adoption, I've also threatened to put my kids up for adoption. Everyone, including the kids, knows it's 100% all jokes (I make especially sure the kids understand this by exaggerating my tone and other things, they have never once thought I was serious). \n\nThis guy is just... odd.", "Block this guy", "If he wants some free cats I got a litter of ally cats in my neighborhood try taking them into his home", "I'm sorry but,\n\n>I had a friend (27m) whom I was super close with in my teens\n\nYou had a friend 6 years older when you were in your teens? I'm gonna straight up call him a creep and that you're definitely better off just permanently removing him from your life."]}
