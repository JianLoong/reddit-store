Your cat, you are not responsible for how he interpreted that post of yours!!", "Idk why are you even asking. NTA at all. That \"friend\" of yours just proved that he's a big AH.. You \"owe\" him nothing, specially a cat. Its not your fault his cat died, you didn't killed him.... And that's a proof that you need to pull him away again for the rest of your life. He's just seems toxic and so entitled\nRUN! Run from that's \"friend\" as fast as you can and never go back!", "???\nObviously NTA?", "You are NTA for not letting a now former \"friend\" adopt your cat", "Lol, NTA, block him and his gf and move on with your life like nothing's happened. You don't owe him anything. The mental gymnastics he had to pull to even think you should have offered your cat after his died is mind-blowing.", "NTA They sound unhinged.", "NTA", "NTA. Ask him if he would've given away his previous cat.", "OP, you're \"friends\" with Mr Heckles. \n\n\n\"You owe me a cat.\"", "Okay, this guy has clearly got something else going on to believe that you \"owe him a cat\". My gods, this is deranged behaviour!! I'd be taking several giant steps back from him and not let him anywhere near my cat. Or his girlfriend fir that matter. \n\nNTA", "NTA. There's absolutely no reason why he'd be entitled to your cat because he misunderstood a joke. \n\nIt seems like he showed his true colours as a 'friend' to you previously, so looks like drifting apart again would be a healthy option", "NTA \n\nYou pulled away from this friend before for a good reason and he had never reached out to you until he wanted something. I\u2019m sure well before his cat died he wanted yours since in the post he\u2019s been waiting. You don\u2019t owe him anything.

This person is not your friend. Cut them out of your life.", "NTA. Keep away from this guy. He sounds unstable. Joking about putting a feline baby up for adoption after being scratched is not unusual and knowing how much you love your baby, he should have known that you weren\u2019t serious. You owe him nothing. He is very immature for his age and he is not your friend.", "NTA, he's a complete idiot!", "NTA of course. Your cat is yours, you don\u2019t own him a thing. If he wants a cat he can just go to a rescue center and offer a better life to one.", "NTA", "NTA, obviously", "Nta. Just cut this drama out of your life though. Block him and go nc", "It was a joke. Animal lovers make that joke. Parents make that joke. I think my first was 2-3 yo and build a stair contraption in her room to get things she shouldn\u2019t. I took a picture and offered her up.

But this just had me speechless.", "I have him (and his girlfriend) blocked as of now because he kept blowing my phone up.", "Do I even need to say, NTA? \n\nKeep your cat away from him, of course -- and avoid contact.

Cut him out of your life, I don\u2019t think it will be too much of a loss!", "Yeesh...so was asking to take your cat his weird ass way of trying to get back in touch?

Maybe he's vain like that and wants your cat instead of a \"boring-looking\" kitten?", "Oh lts a completely ridiculous request and I would be shocked too!", "Put some country miles between you two.

And, if it is, no way OP thinks they are the AH.", "NTA. Where is this person coming from?", "Your \"friend\" is delusional. I can't imagine thinking I was somehow entitled to someone else's pet. \n\nNTA", "Nta. Block him on everything.  An occasional cat meme isn't worth interacting with this loon.", "What a weirdo. Block and move on. NTA", "Op You wouldn\u2019t give a family member away if your friend lost a sister or something else. Your cat is your baby and should stay with someone that loves them and that is only you as you see your fur baby as family and not an object. If these should be ex friends know your address move away before they try to take your cat as he might be unhinged enough or decide if you can\u2019t have toy cat no one will. Be safe op and get cameras if you are unable to move.", "Good god-you owe him nothing.  This is an indication that you should cut contact with him again-he sounds unstable!", "NTA. Stop contact.

I almost daily tell my mom that she will get my cats in the mail. I have a tendency to get overactive and crazy cats that drives me insane. I love my cats and honestly do not know what I would do without the crazy. \n\nBUT it does drives me insane daily and therefore my mother gets a text or phone call where I say she will get my cats. Her response are always: What have them done now? Everyone in my life know I complain but never are serious. Who even believe that?? \n\nDump the friend.", "NTA, what a d-bag.

Please tell me this isn\u2019t real. \n\nDid he seriously say he was waiting for you to offer him YOUR cat? That\u2019s like expecting someone to give you their car because yours got stolen.

Why would he need to demand yours?

Half of them want to breed, they are easy to reject because I had that taken care off before she even turned six months old, the other half just wanted a tortie because it seems they are hard to find? Your friend is nuts, so are the people who think they can try to buy/adopt cats from people who aren\u2019t about to give up their babies.\n\nI would have laughed at your photo and then sent you my \u201cbattle\u201d scratches from my kitty. It\u2019s clearly a joke and if your friend was a true cat owner they would know you weren\u2019t serious. Get him out of your life and never let him near your cat.
