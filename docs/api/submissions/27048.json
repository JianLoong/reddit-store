He continued his upward mobility and you stayed home sacrificing retirement savings, income savings, career connections, etc.\n\nHe has the PTO. You do not.

Did your husband help you while you were staying at home with your son? Did he do the dishes, feed the baby, do laundry, cook, etc or did it all fall on you?", "NTA\n\nYou don't have PTO yet. Safe to say he does. Until you get some, he needs to be the one that stays home. Especially since he (very likely) has never had to call out of work for a sick kid. It'd be a completely different story if you both had equal PTO and you wanted the person who makes more money to stay home.", "OP just stand your ground and don't falter.  Explain to him that until you can actually get your footing in your new job, accrue PTO, this is what has to happen for the time being unless he has an alternate backup plan to take care of those situations when your child needs someone to stay with your child because it's not going to work if you're fired before you have a chance to actually prove yourself.", "NTA. Of course he's higher up.  He didn't make the sacrifice of putting his career on hold to care for your child.  This is why men usually out earn women, aside from blatant sexism in the workplace.  You need to have a conversation with him.  I'm concerned he may be having second thoughts about \"allowing\" you to work and is now trying to sabotage your new job (a type of financial abuse).  I hope I'm wrong.  You need to make clear he will be the one staying with your child until you've been in the job longer and have ample PTO built up or can wfh.  If he refuses ....do you really want to stay with someone so unreasonable?", "NTA he can\u2019t have both.

He needs to take on the role of primary, while you both look for backup child care.", "NTA\n\nYour husband has the PTO, you don't.  He's not as important to his work as he thinks he is.  If he died tomorrow, his workplace would replace him in the blink of an eye.\n\nI wonder if he's not sure what to do with a sick kid seeing as you've done most of the caring for your son since he was born.

You should have a conversation with him and let him know he needs to show some compassion because you have just started out and it is not a good look on you to call out sick so early especially when he has PTO.

You are making less than a third so he provides the lifestyle you are accustomed too, but he should lose out or damage his standing so you feel equal? Is 80 equal to 250? It is so funny that the foundation of the family structure is so quickly dismissed for feelings. Is more money or less money better for your family to exist on?

I would ask at the daycare and other parents who they recommend. They may have agencies or a list of Nannie\u2019s/babysitters they work with. Ask for references and then vet those people so you have a roster. This is something all parents should have because you never know when it\u2019s needed.", "NTA.

My husband goes to work and takes care of all finances so I don't worry, I stay home and take care of the house for him. I can see dividing chores when they're both working, but why should your partner (men or woman, don't care) have to go to work all day and then come back to keep working when you were home all day? I'm SAH too, and everything is done when my husband is back, dinner is ready and babies lay down; after we have dinner, I'll clean up and prepare everything for him in the morning, that's what it is. This new \"I want to stay at home but do nothing\" is bullsh*\n\nRegarding the current situation though, I don't think you're the AH, you are both working, so he's not the sole bread winner anymore and that changes things. He needs to collaborate with something, either chores or baby duty, he's a father too, not just your child, and it's also his house.

Not money to be sneezed at but you're making it sound like it's worthless at this point.\n\nAlso she wasn't earning anything before so this is bonus money for the family even taking day care fees into account.", "He\u2019s going to damage his standing by taking less PTO? Why even have it then.

There is nothing he is giving up except free time that would otherwise be spent on leisure activities, and he agreed to give that up when he agreed to be a father. It's called responsibility. \n\nWell done for trying to apply your boy logic to a real life situation though.", "He had PTO he can use, how would that damage his career?", "I think you need to have a big conversation with your husband about equal parenting and chores. It\u2019s a sad state of affairs when divorced women with kids report having more time for themselves because they\u2019re not having to clean up after and mother their husbands anymore. You should ask yourself if your life would be easier or harder if you were a single parent and if so, your husband needs a come to Jesus moment.", "So a SAH parent should work all day AND all night?   That seems unfair and a recipe for burn-out - particularly with difficult or multiple kids.", "No. What I\u2019m saying is that the opportunity hasn\u2019t been realized yet.

The endless jokes around people having surgery and still working on the laptop up until they are prepped exist for a reason! The working culture is toxic excuse me for believing how bad it is! Maybe go and read up on the culture before attempting to mock. This is only a problem because the man did not comply and should have done whatever his wife wanted. Especially as providing a home paying for everything means nothing now and in this current moment only his wife contributes anything. It is a obvious theme that is played out in most posts with a woman as the poster that her husband is useless and incompetent, even if he is a top 10% earner  it is nothing next to being at home or being a mother. Then when someone says that makes no sense the pitchforks and torches turn up. I am still waiting for the main force to dv me into oblivion", "I don't work all day and all night, it doesn't take all day to clean the house and do shopping. You do a bit here and there, and still have \"you\" time if you're organized. I also take care of kids and still manage to do it all. I'm also compromise with some health issues, so it's not impossible. I do have help from my husband any time I ask though, it's not that he won't lift a finger either. But yeah, that's my life.\n\nI supposed it depends of the marriage as well. In my case, we have an honest relationship where we both do our best to support each other with anything we need, the best we can. So if I'm having a bad day, health-wise, for example, he'll do chores and parenting so I don't have to, but usually that's my \"role\". And I take pride in my husband been always presentable, fed and happy. He's awesome and hard working, and I don't think it'd be fair for me to be home all day and for him to come back from working all day to having to make dinner, baths, playtime, cleaning.. as well \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nOnce again, this is my situation, and how I see it.

Up to the age of two my twins were getting up multiple times through the night, plus for awhile I was having to pump at night to try to get my supply up. So yeah, I was working day and night as a SAHM and still it took many discussions with my working husband to see that he needed to pitch in/we needed to hire a bit of help.", "Oh yeah, we are lucky with good sleeping babies \ud83d\ude05. I can see how different situations can affect the household organization in that sense and the dividing of tasks and that. My husband does help if I ask him though, and every situation should be takes between the couple. I'm not saying I'm right or this is the way either", "Yeah, I could see that from your initial comment and I appreciate that! It\u2019s rare for people to be so nuanced and balanced on Reddit, ha ha. I mainly included that just to add to the list of things that need to be considered when assessing equal division of labour. In my experience night wakings can be devalued."]}
