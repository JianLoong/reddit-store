Maybe go and read up on the culture before attempting to mock. This is only a problem because the man did not comply and should have done whatever his wife wanted.

How is my husband putting my child first in this situation but I\u2019m not?", "He has the ability to work from home. I do not. We are both providing financially now.", "He would still be getting paid and not losing any money if he took his PTO\u2026. Not girl math. We would be losing money if I took time off. I stepped away from my career for a period of time that was deemed necessary for my family. Just because I am now entering back into my career after time off doesn\u2019t make it less important. Also, I am paying for childcare with this new job.", "NTA he needs to understand that this is what entails of being a f****** parent especially when both parents have active careers tell him to get the f*** over himself and be a damn parent", ">why should your partner (men or woman, don't care) have to go to work all day and then come back to keep working when you were home all day?\n\nBecause house chores and child rearing never end, doesn't give you weekends, holidays, PTO neither retirement. So as much as the stay home person should be doing more than half due to it being their primary occupation, the other partner still needs to take up on some of the burden otherwise the stay at home person will literally never rest to the end of their lives.", "...who brought the idea of you returning to work?", "It\u2019s not about money alone. The impression you need to make at work having just started to is the bigger concern.", "You are totally NTA here, but let me say this: I spent 14 years making huge personal, professional, and financial sacrifices to get my ex through his postgrad education (4 years) and training (5 more years), and then moving to shithole USA where I couldn't get a tech job because that's where he got a job. 14 years where he and his career were the top priority in *everything*.\n\nAfter 14 years, we moved to a much better location, and it was **finally** my turn to have things start being about me.\n\nExcept that, after 14 years of everything being about him, he had decided he really liked everything being 100% about him -- and he was not willing to change it back to even being 50/50 about me.\n\nYou need to set the precedent **now** that it is time for *your* career to take precedence in your marriage. **It's your turn.** If he won't agree to that, then you should ask him to do marital counseling. And if he won't agree to that, then you need to think long and hard about whether you want to stay in a marriage where you're a second-class citizen instead of an equal partner.", "So your husband expected you to miss a full week at a new job where you have no PTO or even the grace of not being immediately written up/fired for missing even a few days. I'm sorry OP but if he's still mad with all that in mind he's being a stupid jerk. You need a serious talk about what the expectations are on both sides.", "Pay would be lost if I took time off right now because I do not have PTO. My husband can do it easier right now. Not sure how that makes me also an AH.", "My wife takes time off, arrives late, and leaves early due to our children at time. \n\nYour job will be ok. Who\u2019s going to say no to a mom needing to take time off for their children? Won\u2019t happen.", "Especially if he both has saved up PTO **and** could opt to work from home if needed. NTA, but the husband is.", "Actually, my husband encouraged me to think about going back to work even just part time at a coffee shop or something\u2026 i Initially didn\u2019t want to but then this new opportunity came up and it was interesting and exciting to me. Again, my husband isn\u2019t \u201callowing\u201d me to work. It was a discussion we both had and we agreed together.", "What makes you and your husband both AHs to me is not talking about this issue before you went back to work.", "I know my job will be okay. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m worried about. But both of us are parents and my husband has the PTO. Never said I would never stay home with my son, but in the current moment my husband has more flexibility. Why is it only the mom\u2019s responsibility to stay home when their child is sick? Why not the father?", "Do YOU take time off, arrive late, and leave early for your children? It sounds as if you expect your wife to shoulder 100% of that responsibility. And many women get fired from jobs because they have taken \u201ctoo much\u201d time off work due to dealing with sick kids, spouses, and other family issues. Where do you live that all employers give \u201cfree\u201d time off to mothers? And why shouldn\u2019t fathers use their PTO if the mother doesn\u2019t have any? \nO.P. you are NTA, and just so you know, I looked this poster\u2019s other responses, and he finds women attractive when they are \u201csubmissive and feminine\u201d, which should tell you all you need to know about him! Eeeewww! Stick to your guns!", "Do YOU take time off, arrive late, and leave early for your children? It sounds as if you expect your wife to shoulder 100% of that responsibility.

The opportunity has been realized\u2026 I was offered a great position for pay that would really allow me to help out our family more financially. Not sure why you are assuming the opportunity wasn\u2019t realized.", "You are well misinformed about what PTO is and the American culture. Are there toxic work places yes, but My husband works for a great company. He himself has called out sick before\u2026. He\u2019s not paying for everything. I\u2019m bringing in money too. I am not demanding he do whatever I want. You are very oblivious with how PTO works.", "....I understand it was a discussion but it was a discussion based on his suggestion. To ease his burden as sole provider or to give you a more satisfying life? I think you threw a spanner in the workings of his intent by getting a real career job and not \"part time at a cafe or something\". Please be careful and stand up for yourself. It is his duty as a parent to take care of your child at this juncture but his reaction tells me you are in for some rough times coming up. He never intended for your job to make you unavailable and the household/childcare needs to fall back on him.", "I guess I\u2019m just confused what exactly there was to discuss? We are both parents, therefore we both play an equal part in my child\u2019s life and sometimes that means one parent has to stay home when he child is sick. But what it doesn\u2019t mean is it\u2019s only one parents responsibility to stay home every single time. Parents take turns. I never said I would never stay home with my son if he gets sick again, I\u2019m just saying I don\u2019t have the flexibility in the current moment and my husband does\u2026.", "I take paternity leave.", "He was excited about this job for me just as much as I was\u2026. If not more. I was so nervous to go back to work, but he was so encouraging about it. When I\u2019m as offered the position he said \u201cyou have to take the opportunity! You\u2019d be silly not to!\u201d", "What is there to discuss? It's discussing and coming up with a plan BEFORE you have this issue because it was going to happen at some point. This is advice for everyone who is in a similar situation. Have a plan in place long before this becomes an issue. I'd even recommend that if it is possible, check with family and friends to see if they can help watch kids in these situations so neither parent has to miss work.", "I am confused by this response. There was plenty to discuss if you clearly weren\u2019t on the same page on how to handle these types of situations (and it will happen again) before you took the job.", "OH, well, whoopdedoo! So, you take time off when the baby is born, but she has to be responsible for ALL other times until the child is old enough to be able to fend for themselves? I feel sorry for her!", "Okay so the reason you\u2019re getting downvoted here is because you\u2019re basically contradicting yourself. First you said that if one parent works and other is SAH, then working parent shouldn\u2019t do a thing at home and the SAH parent (in your situation, you) should do all the household work. But in the same breath you state that you have a condition which can occasionally prevent you from doing all the work and those times you ask your husband, the working parent, to do the work for you. This isn\u2019t a criticism of your condition or anything because every single person is a human being and with or without debilitating conditions we all have off days, some days we get a lot done and others we get very little. But you\u2019re contradicting yourself by saying that you as the SAHP do everything and don\u2019t expect anything of the working parent, and yet clearly you don\u2019t do everything and do ask for help from the working parent.", "That's terrific - but he doesn't get to have it both ways. If it's an opportunity, you have to be able to take advantage of it, which means he has to step up.\n\nFor the record, I went through this scenario first day of school this year - I'm a teacher, newly returned to full time after most of decade as a stay at home parent/occasional sub. My spouse is a senior engineer at a major tech company. I'm not joking when I say that he makes 8.5 TIMES what I make - and that's before we calculate value of benefits/retirement. \n\nOur kid was sick that weekend and the night before I was trying to figure out how the heck we were going to handle it, and my spouse literally grabbed my hands and said \"You're going to work tomorrow. If kid needs to stay home, kid stays home. I either work from home or cancel everyone and take PTO. Stop fussing - I've got this\". \n\nThat's how it works in a parenting partnership. Your husband needs to get his head around that.", "....well that's good news, so then it should be no problem for him to step up as needed for you to succeed.  I wish you only good things OP, I hope it all works out!", "If he was SO excited for you he would be doing everything in his power to make sure you are successful in new said career yet he\u2019s not. You need to think about that. And remember just because someone says something doesn\u2019t necessarily make it true.", "Why are you getting defensive? You're NTA but your husband is being a shitty husband and a father. Who cares if he encouraged you to go. Now you have your new job and he wants you to risk it because he doesn't want to be a partner to you or a father to his child when he's perfectly capable of doing so. Open your eyes, you know he's being shitty (that's why you're here) so put your foot down and be firm with him, explain that you've put enough of your life on hold and you staying home could cost you your new job (which makes his encouraging you to get it completely useless) and would cost him possibly a day or two of sick or vacation pay. Or like I read in another comment, he can work from home.\n\nInstead of arguing with people in the comments, take a look at your husband's actions. *He doesn't want to help you or be there for your sick child* and I would probably demand why if he was so gung-ho about you going back to work.", "I\u2019m answering peoples questions. Not getting defensive. Someone asked who\u2019s idea was it for me to return to work. I\u2019m just clarifying. Definitely not defensive or arguing.", "you're definitely getting defensive"]}
