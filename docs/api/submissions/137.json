{"id": 137, "submission_id": "yisbx1", "title": "AITA for deciding not to go trick or treating last minute?", "selftext": "  \n\nI (26F) absolutely love Halloween, it\u2019s my favorite time of year. This year I started on my costume in August. I asked my boyfriend (26M), who could care less about being festive for Halloween one way or the other, if he would do a couple's costume with me. He said yes so, I bought most of his costume with a few handmade details. I spent the last month sewing my costume together but most of his costume was easily purchased. We were getting ready today to go trick or treating with his niece when he walked into the bathroom so I could do a small bit of makeup when I noticed that the button I had hand painted and hand sewn on his false turtleneck was gone. I asked him what happened, and he said he had ripped it off and thought it was \"just something I had used for sewing\". I got mildly upset and asked why he didn't ask me before ripping it off. He said that I never ask him about many things before I do them and gave a half assed apology, a quick sorry. I asked him if he ripped the one off the belt as well and he said yes, I got a little bit more upset. While I was upset, I was trying to keep calm and quickly sewed the buttons back on so we could finish getting ready. I handed him the false turtle neck first and he said the button was falling now to where you couldn't see the face of it and said I should have just fabric glued it. So I put a bit of fabric glue to hold to top of the button in place. He didn't even wait for it to come anywhere near dry before saying it wasn't working and trying to add fabric glue to the bottom part and ended up smearing glue on the turtle neck. He said he should just rip it back off. At this point I was throughly pissed off and just told him to leave it alone and that I was going to finish getting ready. He asked me if I was going to be like this the whole time tonight and if so, I could just stay home to which I said nothing. He then told me we won't be stopping at the liquor store on the way there like he had told me we could earlier and that it was my fault for running late. I told him I didn't even want to go anymore. He started going on about how I was throwing a fit, even said I stamped my feet and raised my voice, which I didn't raise my voice until this point in the argument. I told him I didn't want to be chastised for being upset over something I put a lot of time in effort over for him to destroy it in 2 seconds. He said I never care about anything he wants and that I never even asked him if he wanted to do the costume. Once he realized I was being serious about not going, he gave me one last chance to say I would go before he took off his costume. I told him to go ahead and take it off and go. After a bit more yelling and expletives, he left. I've been sitting here in my costume for the past hour and a half wondering if I overacted, but I felt like he gaslighted me and I can't stand the thought of being near him right now. I'm pissed that this Halloween has been ruined for me after all I put into it.

My car won't start so even if I could have found something else to do I wouldn't have had a way to get there. He was willing to wear the costume, that's not the issue.

This is my story and I hardly get on here so I have no idea what you are referring to\n\nEdit: Scrolled through quite a few threads and I still don't know what you are referring to", "Are you a perfectionist ? Sometimes, the other person could not care less.", "Yes, and wishing I could seek therapy for it if it wasn't so damn expensive. But that's a whole other thing in itself. It's not that he didn't want to wear the costume, he was willing to. It was that he didn't air any of the grievances until I was already upset. I feel like he was gaslighting me. He actually asked to pick next year's costume to which I happily agreed because that's the most interest he's ever shown in it."]}
