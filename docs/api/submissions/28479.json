But I do agree with the other commenter about discussing big gifts with her mom so there\u2019s no double gifting and just so she has a heads up.", "NTA you dont need permission to give your daughter gifts. But as parents my ex & i usually give eachother a heads up when we plan to give our daughter gifts of that nature. Sometimes - as in your situation - it prevents double-gifting. It doesnt even have to be about the cost.", "You are both the A-hole. You for not communicating with your Ex about what is best for the child. Your Ex for letting her issues get in the way and starting drama with you. That could not have been comfortable for the child, I am sure she knew how that situation made your Ex feel. Next time, consider your daughter, and you daughter only and you won't make this kind of mistake in the future.", "YTA. Do you not understand what co-parenting is, or what's the story? You actually do need to be in regular communication with your daughters mother about things like this.", "ESH, communication is key and y\u2019all did none of it", "The best thing would have been. I think it is a thoughtfull gift, but since it is for school let me check with her mother.   \n\n\nYes YTA. Check with her or her mother before giving her the laptop.", "YTA you should have communicated this to your ex.  What is your daughter going to do with two computers? Your ex just dropped a few hundred dollars on a gift your daughter is not going to use now.  If you inform her she could have gotten a different gift that your daughter will use.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I said sure why not\n\nThis is why YTA. You should have said something first....you know, when she asked? Parents are supposed to work together for their children, not show their ex up with a better gift.", "YTA .. you should definitely discuss large gifts for your child with your ex. This is just common courtesy to avoid these kinds of reactions. You would want your ex to do the same for you. \n\nESH, your ex claiming your sister is trying to \"steal\" your daughter is an absurd and childish reaction to this situation. She has the right to be upset about lack of communication, but the rest is just lashing out.", "NTA - its supposed to be a surprise, good for the kid", "Did they tell you they were getting a laptop for her?", "ESH. Not in a big way, but yeah you should check with parents when buying a big gift for their kid. Buying them a big gift is absolutely fine, if you've checked that they didn't buy them essentially the same thing already. \n\nSo only very mildly the asshole, but still your fault.\n\nEdit: changed to ESH, because they also should have checked with you.", "Technically yta for not telling mom that you had it covered. She could have gotten a different gift.", "Seems like a lot of emotions are at play here but if your ex is arguing that you should have told her about the MacBook, she should have told you about the chrome book so NTA", "No I don\u2019t think you are. It works both ways in this situation, her mother didn\u2019t check with you either so. Her mom can\u2019t expect you to be doing something when she isn\u2019t doing it either.", "But it is also the responsibility of the mother to check that the father hasn't already bought something similar too.\n\nIf you think OP is the AH then you surely agree that the ex is an AH. So its ESH", "So how is the ex not at fault for not communicating that she bought a chromebook?", "A parent can buy a child a large ticket item. That\u2019s not a problem, but if somebody else is buying the child, a large ticket item there needs to be communication between both parents that a large ticket item is being bought for their child.  That\u2019s the whole point of the sister asking if it\u2019s OK to buy a large ticket item.  That is why this guy is the asshole. He should\u2019ve communicated this information.  When you\u2019re coparenting, it\u2019s super important to have good communication."]}
