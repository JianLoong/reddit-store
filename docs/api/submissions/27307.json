Can you think of something you may have missed? What is the situation around you getting your new place?", "NTA.  It's one thing to store some things for family.  It's another to become their storage unit.\n\nI think you did the right thing by offering to help them go through things to make it more manageable.  But I wouldn't have agreed to storing anything until I had seen the storage unit and the amount of items that they wanted stored.", "**NTA** \\- You were willing to store the amount that she requested.  Then she brought much more.  You are probably better off now that she is done with you.", "You just dodged a bullet. Does your sister have a habit of manipulating you to get what she wants ? It would be surprising if it was the first time and her comment about your parents is awful. Your sister didn't really ask your opinion, she lied and forced you at the last minute to store more stuff than agreed.\n\nNTA", "Some additional context that I couldn\u2019t fit because of the character limit:\n\nIt wasn\u2019t possible for me to visit the storage unit before hand. The place they leased requires your name be on their access list to enter the property. They didn\u2019t put my name on the access list initially and the only way to add someone is for the person on the lease to physically go to the property with their ID and fill out paper work. Trust me, I would have gone if I could.\n\nThe stuff is already gone. In the series of conversations I kept asking her for updates on what she wanted to happen and ask how I could help. I asked for an update because our neighborhood doesn\u2019t allow overnight street parking, our driveway only fits two cars, an I needed the garage freed up since I needed to start bringing a work truck home since my promotion. She snapped and with less than 48 hours notice, told me some of her friends would show up to our house on a Saturday to load up all of here stuff so that I wouldn\u2019t do anything with it. This Saturday was the day we were celebrating my husband\u2019s birthday and she was trying to tell me I needed to cancel his birthday plans to be at the house to let them in. Thankfully after several hours of back and forth she agreed they would get there at 7am to make sure it didn\u2019t interfere with our plans.\n\nThe reason I\u2019m posting now is because I thought after she had a few days to cool off we would be able to patch things up. It has been 3 weeks since her friends came to get her things and it\u2019s still radio silence on her end. I\u2019ve been trying to take the high road and still reached out to her for her birthday, their anniversary, I even reached out to give her some exciting life news and nothing.\n\nShe is still so upset about how things turned out that I was second guessing how I handled the situation and wanted to see if others thought the same.", "Nta. You agreed to a few sentimental boxes. Not her complete hoard of shit.", "NTA - what ended up happening was not what you agreed to. You agreed to a few things and asked more than once about the volume of items. You didn't agree to a truck and trailer.", "NTA.  Your sister deliberately misrepresented the amount she wanted you to store, AND you gave her three options.  Most people wouldn't have physical space for a truck and trailer's worth of items.  I know I certainly don't.  I don't know what your sister expected to happen.", "NTA\n\nJunk the shit, if it got left on your property.  She's clearly abandoned it.", "NTA  \nYou and she agreed the amount of stuff and you both saw the available space together.  You don't have more space that was shown.  She does have more things than can fit in there.  You proposed 3 reasonable solutions (although they do all seem to involve all the things being at your house at least temporarily, so she might well argue that means that they can fit).    \n\n\nIf you still have all the items, then it would seem prudent to start on option 2 (hey, you've crossed an uncrossable line already anyway huh).  That doesn't involve getting rid of anything, and you will ultimately be able to store more of it.  Maybe that will also give her time to calm down.  In the meantime, give it (metophorical) space.  Good luck.", "NTA. Massively. You were only told about the amount you agreed to. She lead you on, and that's her fault. She cannot be thinking that in the end when it was to show up, that you would just be so okay with it all. Like seriously? You agreed to the first amount. Not this one. She's making a storm cause she's mad that she didn't get her way. \n\nI am adopted myself. Extremely pissed off about that comment as well. They are still your parents whether they were blood relative or not. They raised you, that what makes them a parent. Doesn't matter how much blood there is", "NTA. You showed her the area that you would use to store and even followed up to check with her that it would fit. It didnt - she lied or under estimated how much space it would take up. \nYou offered reasonable solutions.\nIm betting your sis was hoping that once it was all there, you would simply cave and store it without a peep.", "YTA. She's family and you AGREED to help her out. Now you're going back on your word? Just because she has more stuff than you expected doesn't give you the right to decide what she should and shouldn\u2019t keep. You should've communicated better from the start.

To avoid her suing you have a lawyer draft a letter giving her X number of days to get the things out of the house.

Your sister misled you about the amount of stuff in the storage unit even after you showed her the space you had available. My suspicion is she was hoping you would just give in and store everything once it was at your place. Ideally you would have gone to the storage unit with her to see how much was there before agreeing to any storage arrangement. Live and learn. \n\nYou didn't specifically say where the stuff is now, but it sounds like it is at your house. Sort through it and pull out anything that is yours then store it or donate it. It's your property so you are responsible for it and can decide what to do with it.\n\nFor the remainder, store what you can in the space you have available. If you want to put in the time and effort you can sort through and try to decide what seems to be the most sentimental or valuable and prioritize that for the storage space you offered her. Basically this is what you described in your second option. \n\nTake pictures of what is left and send them to your sister telling her that this is what you don't have room for. She has XX days to do something with it or you will donate it. Do not offer to move it to a storage unit for her or you will find yourself footing the bill for the unit indefinitely.
