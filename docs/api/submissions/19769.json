{"id": 19769, "submission_id": "14ac6cp", "title": "AITA for \"silencing\" my GF?", "selftext": "I (M28) have been dating my GF, Nancy (F25), for about 2 months now. We met on a blind date that our friends set us up on and have been seeing each other relatively regularly since then. I'm not entirely sure if we are officially BF/GF, but Nancy seems to think so.\n\nNancy describes herself as a bit of a \"mean girl.\" I honestly thought she was joking for a while, as she is typically quite nice. However, she has an awful tendency to insult people based primarily on their appearance. These insults can happen anywhere and anytime, and can be targeted at literally anyone. Of course, she never says these things about the person right in front of them.\n\nThe other day, I invited Nancy to a family friend's event we were having. My mother's friend, Sarah, had just gotten out of the hospital for cancer. Sarah's family and my family are very close; I've known them since I was born and consider them to be extended family.\n\nDue to cancer and chemotherapy, Sarah no longer has hair and is very thin. Once Nancy saw her, she started smirking. I literally pleaded with her not to say anything rude, and she agreed but told me that I was ruining her fun.\n\nFast forward, I'm chatting with my mother (F55) and sister (F24). Nancy walks by and says hello. She chats for a bit before starting to make several highly offensive jokes about Sarah and her appearance. I will not repeat anything, but her jokes mainly pertained to baldness and anorexia.\n\nMy mother and sister looked mortified, and so was I. I literally had my jaw hanging open for a good few seconds. Once I snapped out of it, I firmly told Nancy to stop and that no one found her shitty sense of humor funny except herself. She got upset and said that I was being controlling and misogynistic for trying to silence her.\n\nI maintained my position and reaffirmed that her comments were insane. She got even more upset and asked that we leave. I said it would be rude for me to go, as it was still relatively early, and she ended up leaving on her own. AITA?\n\nUPDATE - I was complaining about you-know-who to my friend who introduced on the phone. He deadass told me that he introduced us on April Fools for a reason \ud83d\ude2d", "created_utc": 1686860221, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14ac6cp/aita_for_silencing_my_gf/", "score": 1209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
