I moved into his house after a year dating. He works a M-F, 9-5 job, I take contract work and my days/hours vary week to week. I'm an introvert, but I work with lots of people and basically always have to be \"on\" at work, so I absolutely require time to myself to recharge. \n\nEarly on living together, I liked to plan one of my days off on a weekday so I could have the house to myself. But frequently, he\u2019d choose to work from home or take a sick day on that day, and I would get frustrated when he didn't leave for work that day. When I expressed this frustration, he'd get annoyed/angry. I told him that I just need time to myself occasionally, it honestly has nothing to do with him, and he responded \"How could it not have anything to do with me, you just told me you don't want to be around me. Plus this is my house, I will be here when I want to be.\" I adapted and got used to living with less alone time for myself.\n \nThings changed during the pandemic, He now works from home every day. He gave up some of his hobbies as well, and it feels like he never leaves the house anymore. I still work contract work out of the house, but I know that I will have virtually no time that is truly to myself when I'm home. I do all the grocery shopping and lots of other errands as a means to be alone with myself, between the drive and the shopping time. Sometimes I just sit in my car in the parking lot, or in the garage, for like an hour in total silence when I drive somewhere. Sometimes he wonders what has taken me so long, and I tell him that I just took my time with the errand.\n \nBut I still need space because I feel drained all the time now, and when I mention that it would be nice to have time alone, he dismisses me and says, \"Where would I even go right now?\"\n \nNow I frequently wear earbuds around the house (sometimes not even playing anything) to cancel out some noise. If I'm in a room alone, and he enters without an obvious plan to interact with me, I\u2019ll get up and move to a different room where I can continue to be by myself. Ex: if I'm sitting on the couch in the living room, and he enters the kitchen right next to me and plays a podcast on the echo and starts making food, I don't ask him to turn off the podcast or leave, I just silently get up and move to the office. Or if he comes into the office, maybe I\u2019ll go down to the basement and sit on the laundry table. I don\u2019t ask him to leave the space or to stop making noise, I simply remove myself to continue my alone time.\n \nSometimes, he thinks I'm being passive aggressive or mad at him and gets frustrated with me. As far as I'm concerned, I have expressed my need to have space, and if he can\u2019t understand, that's on him. I see it as a compromise to have my alone time and meet his needs as well.\n \nSo AITA for creating my alone time by whatever means necessary?\n\nEdit for clarity:\n-I work out of the house 2 jobs 60-70 hrs per week. Lots of human interaction at both. He works from home full time since Covid. \n-To clarify, I don\u2019t leave the room *every time* he walks in. It\u2019s once or twice per week when he comes into the space I have specifically put myself in to be alone, almost always when I get home from work, after saying hi and checking in. For example: \u201cHey, how was your day?\u201d That\u2019s great, my day was super busy. So, I\u2019m heading back downstairs to relax while you finish your work day. Still want tacos for dinner, yeah? Cool, let\u2019s eat at 5:30 before I leave [for job 2]\u201d\n-If he comes down to interact with me, talk to me, help me with whatever I\u2019m working on, then I stay and hang out with him. But when he\u2019s just making noise in the room when he knows I\u2019m trying to quietly relax, I do relocate sometimes.\n\nEdit 2:\n-Not sure where the idea came from that I live for free in his house and frankly I\u2019m not sure why its relevant. We split all expenses based on our income ratio, I pay 45% and he pays 55% of all expenses, including mortgage, insurance, utilities, internet, groceries, house & yard maintenance, etc.\n-I also really enjoy cooking as a hobby and have some dietary needs so I do nearly all the grocery shopping, cooking, meal prep- breakfast, lunch, and dinner to cover both our meals for about 5 of the days a week. \n\nProbably done responding now. Thanks to all for all the feedback, it\u2019s been very helpful and insightful, and I appreciate all the different perspectives.

You have to very clearly communicate what you need from your partner and come up with solutions together. And if he can\u2019t compromise with you for your benefit, this is not the relationship for you. Respecting your partners need for space is absolutely necessary. I myself do not need to spend every moment with my partner, and he is very much like your boyfriend. I just had to tell him that I needed time to myself when we were home. He could play his games, I could watch tv in the living room or read, but I couldn\u2019t entertain him all the time.", "ESH.\n\nYou both need better communication skills. Tell him outright that you need to be alone and set boundaries for yourself. Maybe set up a day with him where he knows to leave you the hell alone.", "ESH. It doesn't sound like he is really respecting your needs for alone time, which you've communicated. Ultimately the way you're going about dealing with it is also passive aggressive and I can see why it's frustrating for him as well. If my partner did these things all the time I would be frustrated too. \n\nIt does sound like a LOT of your time is spent wanting to be alone, which may not be compatible with cohabitating. Do you have any friends or hobbies that get you out of the house, or is it just work and errands? I don't think you can just be mad at him for being in his own home, especially when it's his work location.", "ESH. This should have been discussed before you ever moved in together. You can\u2019t count on having alone time/space in shared spaces (your example of him coming to the kitchen to cook- that\u2019s an entirely reasonable thing for him to do.) it sounds like you two should consider a home that has one more room so there are two living spaces, or carving out a corner of the bedroom for a space where you can hang out that isn\u2019t in the common areas. This was a predictable, and therefore preventable conflict. If you can\u2019t come to a mutual understanding I would seriously consider if you want to be in a relationship where one person leaves the room every time the other one enters.", "NTA. He is for not letting you have some time to yourself. It's a perfectly reasonable, and perfectly normal, request.\nHe makes it about him and ignores your needs.\n\nYou're going to go crazy if you guys don't work this out. If he won't accept that you need some space, do you really want to spend the rest of your life sitting in your car in the garage every time you need to be alone?", "ESH because your BF should be letting you have space, but leaving the room when he comes in isn't sustainable either because it doesn't actually solve the problem of him not respecting your need for alone time. It sounds like you're incompatible, and if you are compatible, there's some serious communication that needs to happen.", "i\u2019m the exact same\nway as you. I don\u2019t think i can ever live with a partner, because my alone time needs are so high.", "Definitely NTA. It sounds like he literally never leaves the house. That would drive me crazy. Can you maybe do a staycation by yourself?", "ESH cos I get that you want ur space and he should give u that on occasion, maybe HE should make the effort to go out and see a friend or family and even stay with them. However the more I read I couldn't just help feeling do u even like the guy or are u kinda over this relationship? Sounds kinda like ur sick of his presence. (Edited for clarity)", "NTA.", "NTA but you definitely need to find a way to talk to him. I'm like you, but fortunately I work in my own office so I get out of the house for that alone time. Even sometimes at home I'll sleep in a different bedroom when I need to be alone, usually when work stress is high. \n\nIt took some time for my GF to adjust, but we communicated well on the subject, and she knows when I need the space and respects it. Your BF needs to learn the same otherwise it'll just end in conflict.", "Info needed: if he\u2019s working from home, where is his work space? Does he have his own \u201coffice\u201d room in the house? Do you?", "NTA.  I am an introvert as well and know exactly where you are coming from.  He simply doesn\u2019t understand what being an introvert means.  I\u2019m not sure of the exact way to get him to but I\u2019d start with a conversation.  Tell him you absolutely love and adore him but alone time is how you recharge.  Explain how exhausting it can be to have to be \u201con\u201d all the time and it wouldn\u2019t matter if it was your mom, your best friend, him or anyone.  Then work out a day or days and times when you can have that time.  It might be 4 days, an hour each or 2 days, 3 hours each, whatever.  If that doesn\u2019t work I\u2019d try to get him to go to couples therapy. It might take a third person to get the message across.", "NTA but take some time to consider what you\u2019re getting from this relationship and if that\u2019s worth your loss of alone time. If it isn\u2019t, you need to have a frank conversation with him.

Wearing earphones around the house with nothing playing to actively avoid him is pretty insane. He does need to respect that you need alone time so he is definitely quite the ah there too. After while I would say most would construe behavior of effectively avoiding your loved one like that as genuine dislike for them. The second to last paragraph especially makes it sound like you do everything you can to avoid basic interactions with the person you supposedly love. Therapy or some hard thoughts about this relationship are required I\u2019d say because this will only lead to him, rightfully so, being angry about it and you never really getting the alone time you need.", "OHHMYYGAAWDD I had to deal with this on a smaller level with my BF (we don't live together). I had to explain that Mondays are my downtime. I'm recovering from the weekend AND that's usually my busiest work day so as soon as I sign off I'm basically a zombie and do not want to interact in any way shape or form with anybody. It's been a problem. He's felt hurt by it/doesn't understand, etc. I've begged- even if you don't understand it can you please just give me this and not take it personally. It's still a struggle.", "YTA. Unless you\u2019re living in a mansion you\u2019re sharing space. If you want solitude, live alone.", "NTA. As an introvert, I get this so much. Your bf is not respecting a basic need for down time, and he's trying to emotionally manipulate you to force you to spend time with him when you clearly need time by yourself. Given that you've already tried to talk about it and he's refused to work with your need for more time alone, to the point that you're constantly drained and struggling mentally, I would strongly consider looking into a we-work office or some sort of rental space where you can be alone for some time each week, at least while working. If that doesn't work, you may need to reevaluate this relationship.", "instead of being at the house just making things worse for both of you, why don\u2019t you sit him down, reexplain why you need down time, and then find somewhere else to go for your day off? Obviously he can be in his house if he wants, sucks that he doesn\u2019t want to be accommodating to you but it\u2019s HIS house. Go to the library, park, where ever you like and then turn your phone off, make it clear you NEED this time to yourself.\n\nEditing to NTA , if you\u2019re paying part of the mortgage that changes A LOT , but to keep it simple, you gotta change this arrangement, you\u2019re helping pay for equity that you\u2019ll never see back if you guys break up!", "YTA. This problem has existed for about five years and you haven\u2019t done the one thing that would solve it - move out. And now leaving a room when he walks in is just making him feel unwanted in his own home. It is more expensive to live alone but it\u2019s worth it to get the space you need. You don\u2019t have to break up, but you should seriously think about whether your relationship has a future if he doesn\u2019t understand your need for space.", "ESH (everyone sucks here), I feel you I also need my alone time to cope w people every now and then but the way you are handling it's very wrong your bf might feel like you are hiding something or are mad towards him. Try to maybe do a hike alone and spend sometime there or maybe go watch a movie somewhere u won't be bother by anyone.\n\nFrom the other side he is also using the ol' reliable \"my house my rules\", okay it's his (it will be \"yours\" when u get married before that it's his gotta acknowledge the difference) house but you also mention u need some alone time to fill ur social patience it could work if BOTH agree at a time to not enter certain rooms or try to evade them for a certain period of time.", "I totally get the need for space, I'm the same way. Like, I generally despise interacting with people. I also live with my girlfriend, who is also very introverted.\n\nI do think that you have some level of responsibility to be considerate of your partner's feelings. Telling him you just need to get out of the house to have some time alone is absolutely valid, my gf does it from time to time and I don't take it personally.\n\nBut making him feel guilty for working from home and/or taking a sick day, or immediately leaving the room whenever he walks in is just plain inconsiderate. I get that you don't feel like interacting with him, but healthy relationships require compromise. Even if it's as much as sticking around for a minute or two and then retreating to another area and telling your boyfriend nicely that you would like to be alone. Maybe consider having \"spaces\" of your own, like your offices. Don't you have an office if you work from home?\n\nBut occupying a common area and then reacting the way you do when he enters it isn't okay. He's right, it is his house too\u2014and he shouldn't feel like he's not welcome there. And I don't blame him for feeling that way. If I were him, I'd feel like I was walking on eggshells whenever I entered my own home, or that I was going to piss you off by entering a place you already were. \n\nI do think it's pretty unreasonable to expect someone to leave a place where you both live so *you* can have alone time. There are other ways of accomplishing this that are less abrasive. Are you sure you don't actually despise this guy? Living together is generally a characteristic of relationships. You might want to reevaluate whether you want to be dating this person, because this isn't a normal way to treat someone you ostensibly care about. So I'd say YTA.", "This is a communication issue", "YTA.  This is SO rude.  You keep trying to kick him out of his house and then when he didn\u2019t then you leave the room?  I can\u2019t imagine he\u2019ll stay with you much longer.  This is NOT how you deal with this.  If you need alone time, carve it out yourself, go for a walk, get a hotel room, etc.  But don\u2019t act like he\u2019s in the way simply for existing in his own house.", "YTA, I can\u2019t believe people are defending you. You are in a relationship with someone. Leaving the room every time they enter makes them feel like something is wrong. This is normal human psychology. If you need that much alone time that you can\u2019t even be in the same room with someone even if they aren\u2019t interacting with you, you need to live alone. It\u2019s not fair to the person you live with. Or you need to have your alone time in a space that isn\u2019t shared. \n\nFYI I am also a person that needs a lot of alone time and it has not been good for my relationships in the past. Most people who want a relationship with someone want to be around that person. They don\u2019t want to have the person get up and leave when they walk in the room.   \nAlso are you planning to have kids? You can say goodbye to alone time.", "NTA and this is ridiculous. This is a you problem. You need a more respectful man. You need a dedicated space. Basically you need a solution because this isn't working.\n\nI have no idea how many rooms you have, but if possible, one needs to be **a dedicated you space**. Close the door, he can't enter. \n\nAlso not sure what is available in your hometown but we have a shared work space. It is like going to Starbucks but with cubicles and no coffee. A cubicle can be rented by the month or the hour. \n\nI rented an office inside a yoga studio for one day a week it was $25 a day and worth every freaking penny. \n\nWe also have a college library which is free to enter and there are some silent remote spots that have wifi.\n\nGOOD LUCK!", "YTA doesn\u2019t sound like you two are compatible. It maybe better if you two lived separately.", "ESH. It really sounds like the two of you aren\u2019t very compatible. I am an extrovert and would be incredibly hurt if my husband left the room every time I entered it. What\u2019s the point of being with him if you don\u2019t like his company? Everyone is concentrating on him not respecting your need for alone time (and it sounds like you need A LOT of alone time) and he\u2019s not by the way, but what about his need for companionship? Why is that any less important? Neither of you is respecting what the other one needs but maybe it\u2019s just not possible to do that and still be happy. Might be time for marriage counseling to see if it\u2019s even salvageable.", "You\u2019re literally conditioning your BF to be insecure and suspicious.

I don\u2019t leave a room literally every time he walks in, just when I\u2019m trying to decompress, usually after work, after we\u2019ve checked-in, asked about his day, etc. It happens probably once, a week. Maybe twice a week if it\u2019s been a rough few days. If that makes me an asshole, fine, that\u2019s what I\u2019m here to find out.", "I see where you\u2019re going with this but I do want to chime in here and say, does the bf explicitly know that OP was in that room because she wanted alone time? I\u2019m the same as OP, I work in an office and get home and need space. If I\u2019m in the living room and my husband comes in to watch TV, I don\u2019t take it as him invading my space, I take it as him wanting to be near me because he\u2019s gets to work from home and as an extrovert he needs company and we love spending time together. If I feel like staying I will, but otherwise, I\u2019ll get up and hang out in the bedroom. I guess the difference is my hubby doesn\u2019t complain or get mad at me as he understands our differences.\n\nEdit for grammar", "I agree with you on this. She is coming off as his presence is nothing but a burden. Sounds like she does have alone time (she just prefers more). It really comes off as she just doesn't want him around at all when she is at home.", "I literally say to my spouse \"I'm not in a bad mood I just want to hang out on the internet for a little while\" (smiling, positive tone) and depending on the exact space, give a kiss or a hand tap then 100% ignore him for like an hour lol. It's fine! OP needs better communication\n\nESH", "I agree that these are all valid solutions to the problem, but I really don't think her bf is being disrespectful by simply existing in his own house, taking an occasional sick day, or deciding to work from home.\n\nIf he were barging into her space when she had communicated to him that she wanted to be alone, that would be one thing. But it really doesn't seem like that is what's going on.", "The issue here it's not \"spending time w each other\" it's that she has a social patience a bit too low and need alone time to recharge it, the problem is that neither want to \"give up\" something.", "Everyone has a right to some privacy from their partner. If my partner was home all the time and in the same room as me all the time, that would drive me up the wall. If I did that to them, it would drive them up the wall. My partner and I respect one another\u2019s needs for alone time and have conversations and arrange to have together time when it works for both of us.", "Are you... not allowed to want to have alone time anymore when you're in a relationship?? I love my boyfriend but I absolutely dont want to spend every second of my waking life with him. \n\nLike op isn't asking for much... bf is the one completely disrespecting her needs.", "If they would have bought a house together would you say the same thing? They agreed to live together. She wants alone time. Nothing wrong with that. NTA.", "Shes removing herself from the situation... how is that wanting bf to \"gtfo\"?", "You need some kind of a signal for him. If telling him directly doesn\u2019t work (including where to avoid you and for how long), then you either need to find a hobby out of the house or make a space even if it\u2019s a large closet that\u2019s yours. I mean, even having a special \u201cleave me alone\u201d hat would potentially work. But while he compromises for you, you also need to compromise for him in proportion so if he\u2019s clingy and needs physical affection that might mean trying to give extra hugs at other times. If it\u2019s impossible to find a compromise, consider if you guys are compatible in terms of your needs.", "NTA. I totally understand you. My boyfriend moved into my house and he needs to talk A LOT after work but RN here so I deal with people every day. I don\u2019t always need space but when I do I tell him I have had a frustrating day I need some time to myself. When he has a hard time respecting that I tell him again that I need quite time alone and I take a bath\u2026..", "Well yeah, that's why I was leaning towards ESH instead of NTA. If OP was communicating that she wanted alone time, she would be NTA, but just leaving without saying anything and giving up on communicating about it lends itself to ESH.", "I don\u2019t think people understand what it is like to live like this. You literally can\u2019t miss the other person because they are always there and in your business. Your cup is so empty there is no energy for them. And they don\u2019t get it. She\u2019s told him she needs alone time and he didn\u2019t care. One element that maybe even OP doesn\u2019t realize is that she needs *predictable* alone time. She needs to know she has this guaranteed time to herself where she won\u2019t be interrupted and can truly relax and recharge.", "I don't think you have any true understanding about introverts. We NEED alone time to recharge and recover. Having to be in the presence of another person, no matter how much we love them, is tiring and emotionally draining. It has nothing to do with the other person. She has tried to explain this to him, but he REFUSES to understand or accept this. It sounds as if she doesn't have any place that she can go to recharge, so she is coping as best as she can. As far as discussing this before she moved in, before Covid and him working from home, this wasn't an issue. She may need to move out to keep her mental health up.", "This post doesn't sound like \"some privacy\" though. \n\nShe's legitimately angry that the dude worked from home a day a week while she was home.\n\nThat's not healthy behavior.", "I don't think the issue is the fact that she wants alone time\u2014it's the way she's going about it. It sounds like she makes her boyfriend feel guilty for even being in the house, even if he isn't interacting with her. Like he can't take a sick day or work from home without pissing her off.\n\nWhen two people\u2014in a healthy relationship\u2014share a home, one shouldn't have to leave the house whenever the other wants alone time. You can exist in the same house without interacting, and if OP is annoyed by simply being in the same vicinity as her partner, then I question whether she should be living with him\u2014or even be in a relationship with him.\n\nRelationships are about compromise. There are ways of communicating that you want space without making your partner feel unwanted in their own house.", "But the point is , they didn't buy a house together, she moved into his house. She leaves the room when he's in it, she's angry when he's home, in his own house. If she craves her space to the point that she can't bear to be in the same space with him she needs to move to her own apartment where she can regulate how much time she spends with him", ">  and when I mention that it would be nice to have time alone, he dismisses me and says, \"Where would I even go right now?\"\n\nThere. That's where.", "She has explained it to him before and he gets annoyed. He also says he can go where he wants in his house. He doesn\u2019t seem to care that she needs alone time.", "Spot on! I have a different brain than my spouse. I know he doesn\u2019t like to chat early or right after work. I\u2019m a chatty person who loves to know about his day, even though I can\u2019t understand what he does specifically. Were there good snacks? Did that coworker bring a new kind of coffee? But I have a filter so I don\u2019t ask 8 million questions at once. \n\nWe had an ok routine, but it\u2019s so rough the past few months because on top of my being WFH almost exclusively, I\u2019ve been dealing with a lot of new health issues. \n\nI started sleeping on our guest room not to be away from him but know I would not be woken up by a cat, or snoring, or my blankets being pulled off.

They wouldn\u2019t be up each other\u2019s asses all day. Go all the way back to hunter-gathers and, again, not on top of each other all the time. \n\nIt is not normal for him to be at home all the time. He should have friends or hobbies or something.

That is not a huge ask.", "u/reasonandmadness, don't bother trying to explain, it's redditland, reading comprehension and commonsense are issues here lol.", "I know she's explained it before.

Ignoring it does nothing but make the problem worse.", "Frequently, yet we're the assholes.", "Agreed, he just doesn\u2019t respect her need for space.

You, to the best of your ability, have communicated your needs and tried to find a compromise.\n\nYour boyfriend doesn\u2019t want to respect your boundaries, and it is okay and normal to have alone time. Sure your boyfriend may own the home, but you mutually agreed to live there. With the ways he has responded to your past attempts to find alone time, I understand the compromise.\n\nI agree with others suggesting therapy - even if it is once a week, that is a frequent enough point of conflict that doesn\u2019t seem any closer to being resolved with things as is.", "NTA, but there\u2019s room to do this differently because it doesn\u2019t seem to be working for either of you.

Regroup around 7:00 for dinner?\u201d \n\nThis says, \u201cI enjoy spending time with you, but can we do it later?\u201d It also gives a specific plan to spend time together and a boundary for your alone time.

If your boyfriend doesn\u2019t allow that, you should move out. You should have a safe place to decompress and regulate. \n\nI lock myself in our bedroom for \u201cme\u201d time. I would prefer the whole house because I also like to do chores alone etc, but I settle for just taking time in the bedroom alone. My husband doesn\u2019t have any problem with this.

I need this for my mental and emotional health - and so I can behave like a good partner to you. How do you suggest I get those 8 hours each week? Is there a day or a room I should choose to achieve that? Or do you have a different idea?\"  \n\n\nTry to approach it as a problem that you two can work together to solve.

Pre-pandemic they got a lot of their socialization through work and hanging out with friends. When the pandemic started their job became work from home. Then they developed a health condition that has kept them here. Their work is virtual. Their friendships are virtual. All of their in-person interactions are me, the kids, and dr\u2019s appointments. It\u2019s been hard for all of us. \n\nMy partner doesn\u2019t truly understand the NEED to be alone, but they don\u2019t take it personally and they try to respect it. But it\u2019s hard with us both being home a lot and our schedules being flexible. I\u2019ve done so many of the things you\u2019ve tried, like sitting in the car, running errands, wearing headphones. \n\nI recently realized that one reason that being alone hasn\u2019t really helped is that it\u2019s unpredictable. Just because I\u2019m alone in the den doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m recharging because I\u2019m a little bit on edge knowing they could pop up at any moment. I\u2019m planning to talk with them about having more of schedule so I know when I\u2019m going to be alone and they know when we can hang out.

I'm exactly the same as you. I'm very introverted, anxious, and experience sensory overload. I live alone for this reason. When I come home from work I need total silence for atleast an hour so my anxiety levels come down, and the sensory overload from work calms down too. We need this alone time to be able to calm our minds, rest, and recharge. If he wont listen or make any effort to be accommodating, then he will be the AH and it would be best for you guys to live apart. His behaviour would be very frustrating and suffocating for me, and would eventually make me not even want to be near him at all.

I would be climbing the walls and screaming by this point and you are absolutely NTA for needing your alone time and doing whatever you can to get it.\n\nIt sounds like your bf is an extrovert, and doesn't understand how *draining* being around people can be. It might help to show him some resources that can explain to him just what his constant presence is doing to you without you coming out and saying \"you being here 100% of the time drains me.\" He's likely perceiving your attempts to explain as an attack on him and gets defensive, which prevents the message getting through. He needs to understand that it's not a *him* thing, it's a *anyone* thing. You would need alone time even if you were sharing a house with friends, family, or the most amazing person in the universe.", "Your probably better off just being alone. Don't expect to have a boyfriend only on your time.", "NTA.  This situation is similar to me and my BF, but with two key differences.  We don't live together and it's role reversal lol.  He's a MAJOR introvert and I've been told (by several people I respect) that I HAVE to have human interaction or I would be very unhappy.  Which I do agree with to a degree but I do sometimes like my alone time.  Me and him have been together going on 4 years. We spend all weekend together and maybe a weeknight together every few weeks.  He's a mechanic so he doesn't have to deal with people, whereas I'm in customer service and sales.  He's said many times he admires my ability to interact with people.  He HATES  with a major passion making small talk and refuses to do it.  There's been times he's ask me not to come over on the weekend as he needs alone time. Which to him 90% of the time means he's out on the boat fishing lol. (Before anyone gets the idea he's off cheating and just using alone time to cover it up, I know he's not as he'll randomly send me a pic of the moonlight on the water, a catfish he'd caught or whatnot.)  Which I respect and leave him alone.  Or he may text me and tell me to not be bugging him when I get there, which I understand as I do talk and ramble on a lot.  So when I get there I'll normally give him a kiss and go play with the cats or find a spot to chill out and read or play on my phone.  Then when he's ready for interaction he'll either come find me and start communicating or text me asking questions or such letting me know he's finished his alone time.  I've often joked when we get a house together we'll need at least a 3 bedroom house, our room, my home office (I work from home) and the \"Alone time\" room.

It surely doesn't feel good to see someone you love (and who you may be trying to be physically close to, even if just within your eyesight) move away from you all the time. I totally understand your needs, because I have those needs too, but we can't ignore what may feel like significant disinterest from his perspective.\n\nHe doesn't have his usual outings (presumably with friends or at least with other humans present) anymore. His down-time is now whittled down to all the time you have together, which is all day, but you may be chasing the need to be totally alone when YOU have down time, which overlaps with his down time.

He could kick me out tomorrow if he wanted, I have no legal right to stay here.\n\nBut it was a bit of a slap in the face when he said that to me (and this was years ago, but it felt relevant to this situation).

When I am very drained and intentionally spending time quietly in my own space, which happens the same time after work each day, if he comes to the room and puts on a podcast or turns on the tv, I move upstairs.

Plus this is my house, I will be here when I want to be.\"\n\nI think it's unfair to say the OP didn't state just that. The partner chose to make it personal, and then lorded his ownership of the space over her as a means of control. Effectively saying \"You don't have the right to have that need met if I don't want you to, because I own this space.\"", "I don't think using the activities of homesteaders or hunter-gatherers to justify how one should behave in contemporary society is even remotely valid, do you?

Why is it normal for OP to be home all the time, but not normal for bf to do the same? Why should her bf be the one who has to go into an office or leave the house for no reason other than to give her space? Why can't she get more hobbies or rent an office to work out of, since she's the one that hates being home after all? It isn't fair to expect him to stay out of the house when she is home just as much. It's a glaring double standard.\n\nShe doesn't need to play with him all the time or have deep conversations constantly. She just needs to share a living space.

It doesn't seem like he's constantly asking her to play board games or something. Plus, they're both working a significant part of the week, so it's not like they're talking all day\u2014and it doesn't seem like he's talking to her when she's trying to work.\n\nPlenty of couples have happy relationships when they both work from home. My boss and her husband do. I work 100% remotely, and my partner is in grad school, so she is home 90% of the time.

I am sorry but I don\u2019t get other answers. If you are working alone in an office and he comes bother you, yes that\u2019s annoying and you wouldn\u2019t be an AH. But he is in the living room? It\u2019s a shared space. You seemed annoyed that he is home. It\u2019s his home. I would feel pretty unwelcome in my own home. If you need some alone time, figure it out yourself, make a plan. Go to the office, a park or whatever. Tell him I need next 5h alone. You can\u2019t get this mad at him for working from home. Where do you want him to go? Stay in the bedroom all day cause you want to be alone? What about him? Come on. I am an introvert who needs alone time and I do not understand this at all. You either need therapy or to live alone because it\u2019s not healthy to be annoyed at your partner for *being home*", "YTA and I say this as a hermit level introvert myself. Your BF is more then likely a physical touch love language type and within the limited time he gets to see you you're basically telling him his presence is at best an annoyance. There are definitely ways to compromise and get your alone time AND fill his love meter but the way you're going about it is extremely selfish in a very toxic and hurtful manner. \n\n*\"As far as I'm concerned, I have expressed my need to have space, and if he can\u2019t understand, that's on him\"*\n\nThis kind of attitude is very unhealthy for a relationship. Physical touch love language types need their partners presence as much as we introverts need our alone time. Even if you're deeply in love with him and loyal your actions to him are screaming you can't even stand to be around him anymore and already a foot out the door, if not already cheating. Actions like just getting up and leaving when he enters the room, lying about where you been and what you where doing out when he was concerned. It's most likely tearing him apart. Like asking him to leave the house is just not how to go about it. These things can compound quickly. If he went and confided in someone already stressed out thinking the worst and explained to anyone your actions and by your own words him not understanding your need for alone time would tell them you're 100% cheating. This is where his anger and frustration stems from. In his perspective the love of his life is pulling away from him and possibly already on her way out and there's nothing he can do.\n\nSo some things that you can change to both get your alone time and make sure the BF's love meter stays healthy, like most here said, is better communication. Not just a sit down and negotiation style compromise but a constant flowing communication. Like if he enters a room you where recharging and relaxing in do not just up and leave. Acknowledge him, give him a couple minutes , interact with him, give him some show of love hug/kiss w/e then explain you're needing your recharge time then if he still needs the room move on to somewhere else in the house and never stop doing this affection and explanation. Also if you're just going to chill in a parking lot or the garage just tell him shoot a text or let him know beforehand that you might so he's not worried. Also be aware that there will be times he may very much need your presence as much as you need to recharge on a bad day and guys are absolutely horrible at asking for help. So if he's being a bit clingy and you're on empty and he seems to be extra in your space flat out ask him he most likely is hurting and needs you. During these times you'll need to able to find activities you can both do in the same space that doesn't overstimulate you and he gets to be close. Like letting him nap in your lap while you read.", "Edit : A tad too harsh, softened tone.  \n\n\nUm...It's understandable you need space but the way you are expressing it is very cruel, and going to make your husband feel stonewalled and neglected.\n\n**I think it's** ***your*** **responsibility to take on LESS WORK so you have more time for both yourself and your marriage.** YTA for taking out your overwhelm with working too many hours on him. **You don't have enough space because you work too much.

He seems like a loving husband being bamboozled by your behaviour.

But if my partner was essentially avoiding me, I would feel weird about it too. \nMy husband works from home and I don't work so it's rare to be alone in the house. \nStill, we get plenty of alone time, for example he'll play games in the office, I'll read a book in the bedroom. If either of us enters the other space we don't flee... we might have a brief, positive interaction and return to our separate spaces. I probably wouldn't try to have alone time in a space that was too close to somewhere he might want to go, like the kitchen.  (I can't think of a reason he would come into the bedroom where I'm reading and disrupt me for any great length of time - if he wanted to have a nap I'd tuck him in and move myself.) \n\nI think that would be the main problem for me- having a negative interaction when encountering my spouse around the house. There's no right way to cohabitate, but for most people it involves some level of being able to tune out the other person and do your own thing even when they're ambiently around. \nIf you told him that you were going to be alone in the laundry room (or anywhere relatively private) for a few hours and to just wait until you came out, would he not give you that space? The way you describe it it does sort of sound like you start to have your alone time and then end up \"running away\" from him when he interrupts it- can you stop him from interrupting it?", "NTA, but you need to have more conversations about your needs. I'm the same way-I have six kids, so there's practically always noise. You reach your saturation point, and you either need time to decompress, or you're going to lose it. And it builds up over time, leading to resentment. I totally get car time. I know lots of people who do it, but you still need time at home too decompress.\n\nI wonder if there's another way to get the point to him. Make sure that he understands that you're not avoiding him, you're just taking space so you can be a better, more relaxed, partner. It's not about him, you don't want you be with ANYBODY for a bit. It lets your brain settle. If he still refuses to leave you alone sometimes, ask him how you can make your time together more meaningful, so he doesn't feel like you're rejecting him. I'm lucky that my husband gets it. Sometimes, I just go and fall asleep because I need to disconnect from all the noise, or I'll get super stressed and snappy. It behooves him to give you space.", "I don't get why everyone is saying the BF is TA here. For what reason? Living at home?

It's OK to need time alone, but it is YOUR responsibility to find a way to do that while respecting that your bf has the same right to use your shared home as you do. I live with my very, very loud family AND have severe misophonia. I cope by using noise cancelling headphones where I create soundscapes with ASMR/rain sounds and spending time in libraries/study spaces. I have 0 right to request people spend less time in the house to accommodate my daily need. Why does your need for being alone take precedence over your bfs need to relax in his own home? It's not like he's banging pots and pants at every hour of the day, he's just existing there. I personally don't feel it's rude to turn on tv/podcasts in the same room as someone else (again, just buy good headphones, and everyones happy) He must feel like he's not welcome in his own home by his own partner; no wonder he's aggravated.

Why not allocate a specific time as his time. So like every evening for 30 minutes you guys go for a walk in the neighborhood and talk. Or every weekend go to a movie or a park or a good restaurant or some fun activity. That way it'll show that he's being catered too. And you will also know that you have to be available then. You can also set 1 hour everyday aside for your me time and let him know of the time so that you aren't randomly at any point of the day or week just walking away from him for a me time. \n\nI think doing one activity with him and doing one separately and telling him that you wanna use that as me time would probably communicate better.", "[deleted]", "Same here.

The entitlement of you and everyone in the comments mad he won\u2019t compromise about being in HIS house.

I also act and feel similarly to you, OP. My partner and I\u2019s solution is that when I get home I have \u201cme\u201d time. I like to shower right when I get home due to the nature of my job so I pretty much immediately go shower and my partner knows that I have \u201cme\u201d time for about an hour and usually leaves me alone in our room. Communicate and things should get better for both of you!", "I also see this question as a problem with two different love languages and attachment styles. It sounds like OP\u2019s boyfriend likes quality time and doesn\u2019t get much of it\u2014so much so that he seeks it out and it gets annoying to OP (who neither needs nor wants all the closeness).\n\nI also note possibly a bit of avoidant attachment style from OP, which means unlikely to be compatible with a person who really needs quality time together in order to feel loved.", "Mine too. My roommate never goes anywhere (with the exception of walks in early morning summers), and I find it so frustrating.

ESH because she\u2019s being rude about it, just leaving rooms when he enters. Yes, he\u2019s rude by not listening to her, but she\u2019s acting horribly. She needs to get her own apartment if alone time is THIS important. She could solve this no problem but is just being passive aggressive about it, like he says.", "I\u2019d love to know how else she should communicate her needs. She told him early on she needs space. He continued to encroach it. When she expressed frustration that he wasn\u2019t going to work on her alone days, he lashed out at her. She has, repeatedly, talked about how she would like some time to herself, to which he replied \u201cwhere would I even go.\u201d When repeated attempts to express herself verbally failed, she started finding other ways to be alone and now leaves the room when she needs quiet time. \n\nTell me, please, what more she should be doing because to me it seems like she\u2019s been very clear all along.", "This is the real answer.", "I agree, ESH. I see various comments stating that she communicated her needs however it's important how it was done as well.\nI'm an introvert working from home, however I would not be happy if my partner came back from work after not seeing him for the entire day and is telling me that he wants me to go out of my home because he needs time alone. It's hurtful to hear especially if you missed this person and were looking forward in spending time together.\nAlso her partner's needs are relevant as well, in the end this needs to be solved by them and have a proper conversation with each other in order to find a solution without overlooking each other's needs/boundaries.", "This exactly!

You're burnt out and overworked. You take on too many hours.**   \nWork is draining you, and your husband is allowed to use the house that belongs to you both; he can use his own space how he pleases. Instead of realizing that **you're heaping on shame and guilt onto your loved one for being happy to see you and existing.** He is NOT \"dismissing\" your need for space by existing in his home, YOU are dismissing your own need for space by pointing at everything else except your long work hours.

I used to work nights and my husband worked days. I loved the days I hung out at home alone. \nIt had nothing to do with him. \nEven now, if I went up to our room to read a book or something, he wouldn\u2019t care.

It\u2019s pretty clear from the post", "My biggest concern, personally, is the way in which he either takes what she says personally, or outright dismisses it. She has tried to be very clear, and he doesn't want to hear it. The \"it's my house, I do what I want\" is the over 20yo way of essentially stomping your feet and saying \"you can't MAKE ME!\". Frankly, the way this situation is described, the BF sounds rather juvenile and a bit on the self-absorbed side of things. Self-absorbed != selfish. Just that for various reasons, including insecurities, he thinks things are always about him.\n\nHonestly, if he is unwilling to make compromises and actually hear what OP has to say, the relationship should likely come to an end as she will burn herself out. I suspect she is already emotionally burnt and just doesn't realize it yet. Sometimes you can want something, but it just isn't what you need in that moment.\n\nBut for sure, OP's BF needs to learn how to actually hear what's being said, without the insecurity/childlike reaction to hearing something he doesn't like. That just can't work out long term. It makes communicating important things impossible, and almost guarantees OP will never really be able to get what she needs to be happy and healthy. NTA, but u/Responsible-Pack-490, you really need to think about this more seriously than I think you realize. I got drained when my SO used to share throughout the day, because they did it randomly, throughout the day, anywhere from 5-15 times, for little things, or they ask me to \"oh you have to look at this\" and it's INCREDIBLY disruptive to my focus. The first few times, it's ok, but by the 4th or 5th, I just want to scream that I need to be left alone to focus. It's highly highly draining. They aren't doing it on purpose either, but that doesn't matter. Thankfully, they are also more receptive to hearing what bothers me, so it's not as difficult to say \"I really need you to stop sharing things throughout the day between this hour and this hour so I can focus.\" You don't seem to have that option, and that's a problem.", "I mean he's wrong for not recognizing it's her home, too.", "He doesn't see it that way.", "Yes.

We get more and more tired the more time we spend talking and interacting with the people around us, especially if the person is right next to us.\n\nSo my reading of this isn\u2019t that OP doesn\u2019t want to spend time with her boyfriend or only wants alone time, it\u2019s that most of the time she\u2019s literally too tired to spend meaningful time with him, and the alone time is the only way she can recharge that social battery. And boyfriend has proven he is unwilling to listen to her on that subject and seems to want every single moment he isn\u2019t working to be spent with her. That just doesn\u2019t work with an introvert, especially one with a job that requires as much socializing as OP\u2019s.\n\nIf boyfriend wants human interaction, there\u2019s friends he could spend it with, possibly, or maybe he could spend it with family.

Being an introvert doesn't give you an excuse to literally be so incapable of \"recharging\" that you need a day to recharge to even remotely interact with people again. I truly can't imagine having your SO leave the room to get away from you just because you walked through and thinking it's a healthy relationship. Your SO should always be your peace and calm and anyone who literally gets to a point where you have to ask the question OP did should not be in a relationship because clearly they need far more \"me\" time and can't commit to anything meaningful for a family.\n\nI would say I'm an extrovert who hates people since I have 0 issue being out but also love being home playing games or spending time with the wife,.daughter, and dogs. I've stated everyone feels like they need a minute sometimes to think but overall if you want a relationship or family than you also have to realize life isn't all about you and that you often need to step up for others sake. OP is TA because she wants a relationship without having to put in effort to actually have a family. He can try to respect time frames but like said above that becomes a chore after a while to most. I still fully believe they should split up because he clearly wants a relationship where they coexist and do stuff together and she wants to sit in a room with cats and a plant to recharge after her shit job that she doesn't want to change...and before someone wants to say maybe it's not a shit job....she's working 60 to 70 hours a week and making less money than her SO who only works 40 hours since she stated how they split finances on what they make and he pays more.", "One, it seems to be implied in the post that he spends so much time with her she doesn\u2019t get her alone time away from people. I also didn\u2019t use being introverted as an excuse, I was simply giving perspective as someone who knows about that situation.\n\nAlso, in one of her edits, OP states that if her boyfriend shows up and talks to her and/or has a reason to interact, she will interact with him back. The problem is when he\u2019s in the same room as her just making noise. Here\u2019s the thing: when your social battery is drained enough, even being in the same room as another person, especially one that makes noise that can bother you, can mess up the alone time and make it inefficient.\n\nAs for her job, considering she is working by contract, I\u2019m not sure she can reduce her hours (I don\u2019t know about working by contract, if someone more knowledgeable could develop on that point it would be appreciated), but I don\u2019t think she has to. She stated she was fine when her boyfriend worked at the office. You\u2019re saying she has to make sacrifices, but what about him? Can\u2019t he just sacrifice a bit of interaction to leave her her alone time? Cause introverts don\u2019t just want the alone time, they need it to function properly.\n\nAlso, the implication that because she\u2019s introverted she can\u2019t handle being in a relationship is, quite frankly, kind of insulting. And to me it shows misunderstanding of the situation. OP isn\u2019t saying that she dislikes her boyfriend or never wants to spend time with him: she just wants her alone time. Something that her boyfriend is proving he either can\u2019t respect or just does not care about respecting."]}
