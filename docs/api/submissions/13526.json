I moved into his house after a year dating. He works a M-F, 9-5 job, I take contract work and my days/hours vary week to week. I'm an introvert, but I work with lots of people and basically always have to be \"on\" at work, so I absolutely require time to myself to recharge. \n\nEarly on living together, I liked to plan one of my days off on a weekday so I could have the house to myself. But frequently, he\u2019d choose to work from home or take a sick day on that day, and I would get frustrated when he didn't leave for work that day. When I expressed this frustration, he'd get annoyed/angry. I told him that I just need time to myself occasionally, it honestly has nothing to do with him, and he responded \"How could it not have anything to do with me, you just told me you don't want to be around me. Plus this is my house, I will be here when I want to be.\" I adapted and got used to living with less alone time for myself.\n \nThings changed during the pandemic, He now works from home every day. He gave up some of his hobbies as well, and it feels like he never leaves the house anymore. I still work contract work out of the house, but I know that I will have virtually no time that is truly to myself when I'm home. I do all the grocery shopping and lots of other errands as a means to be alone with myself, between the drive and the shopping time. Sometimes I just sit in my car in the parking lot, or in the garage, for like an hour in total silence when I drive somewhere. Sometimes he wonders what has taken me so long, and I tell him that I just took my time with the errand.\n \nBut I still need space because I feel drained all the time now, and when I mention that it would be nice to have time alone, he dismisses me and says, \"Where would I even go right now?\"\n \nNow I frequently wear earbuds around the house (sometimes not even playing anything) to cancel out some noise. If I'm in a room alone, and he enters without an obvious plan to interact with me, I\u2019ll get up and move to a different room where I can continue to be by myself. Ex: if I'm sitting on the couch in the living room, and he enters the kitchen right next to me and plays a podcast on the echo and starts making food, I don't ask him to turn off the podcast or leave, I just silently get up and move to the office. Or if he comes into the office, maybe I\u2019ll go down to the basement and sit on the laundry table. I don\u2019t ask him to leave the space or to stop making noise, I simply remove myself to continue my alone time.\n \nSometimes, he thinks I'm being passive aggressive or mad at him and gets frustrated with me. As far as I'm concerned, I have expressed my need to have space, and if he can\u2019t understand, that's on him. I see it as a compromise to have my alone time and meet his needs as well.\n \nSo AITA for creating my alone time by whatever means necessary?", "created_utc": 1680138330, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1266s91/aita_for_leaving_the_room_when_my_bf_enters/", "score": 55, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Because his response is that he feels he shouldn't have to leave his home (understandable). \n\nSo is this simply alone time or alone time in the house", "You\u2019re NTA for needing time to yourself, but you need to take a long look in the mirror and ask if this is a relationship that is sustainable. You have to very clearly communicate what you need from your partner and come up with solutions together. And if he can\u2019t compromise with you for your benefit, this is not the relationship for you. Respecting your partners need for space is absolutely necessary. I myself do not need to spend every moment with my partner, and he is very much like your boyfriend. I just had to tell him that I needed time to myself when we were home. He could play his games, I could watch tv in the living room or read, but I couldn\u2019t entertain him all the time.", "ESH.\n\nYou both need better communication skills. Tell him outright that you need to be alone and set boundaries for yourself. Maybe set up a day with him where he knows to leave you the hell alone.", "ESH. It doesn't sound like he is really respecting your needs for alone time, which you've communicated. Ultimately the way you're going about dealing with it is also passive aggressive and I can see why it's frustrating for him as well. If my partner did these things all the time I would be frustrated too. \n\nIt does sound like a LOT of your time is spent wanting to be alone, which may not be compatible with cohabitating. Do you have any friends or hobbies that get you out of the house, or is it just work and errands? I don't think you can just be mad at him for being in his own home, especially when it's his work location.", "ESH. This should have been discussed before you ever moved in together. You can\u2019t count on having alone time/space in shared spaces (your example of him coming to the kitchen to cook- that\u2019s an entirely reasonable thing for him to do.) it sounds like you two should consider a home that has one more room so there are two living spaces, or carving out a corner of the bedroom for a space where you can hang out that isn\u2019t in the common areas. This was a predictable, and therefore preventable conflict. If you can\u2019t come to a mutual understanding I would seriously consider if you want to be in a relationship where one person leaves the room every time the other one enters.", "NTA. He is for not letting you have some time to yourself. It's a perfectly reasonable, and perfectly normal, request.\nHe makes it about him and ignores your needs.\n\nYou're going to go crazy if you guys don't work this out. If he won't accept that you need some space, do you really want to spend the rest of your life sitting in your car in the garage every time you need to be alone?", "ESH because your BF should be letting you have space, but leaving the room when he comes in isn't sustainable either because it doesn't actually solve the problem of him not respecting your need for alone time. It sounds like you're incompatible, and if you are compatible, there's some serious communication that needs to happen.", "i\u2019m the exact same\nway as you. I don\u2019t think i can ever live with a partner, because my alone time needs are so high.", "Definitely NTA. It sounds like he literally never leaves the house. That would drive me crazy. Can you maybe do a staycation by yourself?", "ESH cos I get that you want ur space and he should give u that on occasion, maybe make the effort to go out and see a friend or family and even stay with them. However the more I read I couldn't just help feeling do u even like the guy or are u kinda over this relationship? Sounds kinda like ur sick of his presence.", "NTA.", "NTA but you definitely need to find a way to talk to him. I'm like you, but fortunately I work in my own office so I get out of the house for that alone time. Even sometimes at home I'll sleep in a different bedroom when I need to be alone, usually when work stress is high. \n\nIt took some time for my GF to adjust, but we communicated well on the subject, and she knows when I need the space and respects it. Your BF needs to learn the same otherwise it'll just end in conflict.", "Info needed: if he\u2019s working from home, where is his work space? Does he have his own \u201coffice\u201d room in the house? Do you?", "NTA.  I am an introvert as well and know exactly where you are coming from.  He simply doesn\u2019t understand what being an introvert means.  I\u2019m not sure of the exact way to get him to but I\u2019d start with a conversation.  Tell him you absolutely love and adore him but alone time is how you recharge.  Explain how exhausting it can be to have to be \u201con\u201d all the time and it wouldn\u2019t matter if it was your mom, your best friend, him or anyone.  Then work out a day or days and times when you can have that time.  It might be 4 days, an hour each or 2 days, 3 hours each, whatever.  If that doesn\u2019t work I\u2019d try to get him to go to couples therapy. It might take a third person to get the message across.", "NTA but take some time to consider what you\u2019re getting from this relationship and if that\u2019s worth your loss of alone time. If it isn\u2019t, you need to have a frank conversation with him. Partners should be understanding of one another\u2019s needs and he isn\u2019t being understanding of yours, but you need to be consistent in your communication with him.", "Your BF just doesn\u2019t *get* that you need some alone time. \n\nIf you want to keep living with him in \u201chis house\u201d, you need an offsite \u201coffice\u201d or something. For you to \u201cwork\u201d in. It doesn\u2019t matter if the \u201cwork\u201d you are doing is on seeing to your own comfort.  He doesn\u2019t  need to know that, and he wouldn\u2019t understand if you were to try to explain it.  NTA", "ESH sounds like you are growing to hate your bf. Wearing earphones around the house with nothing playing to actively avoid him is pretty insane. He does need to respect that you need alone time so he is definitely quite the ah there too. After while I would say most would construe behavior of effectively avoiding your loved one like that as genuine dislike for them. The second to last paragraph especially makes it sound like you do everything you can to avoid basic interactions with the person you supposedly love. Therapy or some hard thoughts about this relationship are required I\u2019d say because this will only lead to him, rightfully so, being angry about it and you never really getting the alone time you need.", "OHHMYYGAAWDD I had to deal with this on a smaller level with my BF (we don't live together). I had to explain that Mondays are my downtime. I'm recovering from the weekend AND that's usually my busiest work day so as soon as I sign off I'm basically a zombie and do not want to interact in any way shape or form with anybody. It's been a problem. He's felt hurt by it/doesn't understand, etc. I've begged- even if you don't understand it can you please just give me this and not take it personally. It's still a struggle.", "YTA. Unless you\u2019re living in a mansion you\u2019re sharing space. If you want solitude, live alone.", "NTA. As an introvert, I get this so much. Your bf is not respecting a basic need for down time, and he's trying to emotionally manipulate you to force you to spend time with him when you clearly need time by yourself. Given that you've already tried to talk about it and he's refused to work with your need for more time alone, to the point that you're constantly drained and struggling mentally, I would strongly consider looking into a we-work office or some sort of rental space where you can be alone for some time each week, at least while working. If that doesn't work, you may need to reevaluate this relationship.", "ESH, instead of being at the house just making things worse for both of you, why don\u2019t you sit him down, reexplain why you need down time, and then find somewhere else to go for your day off? Obviously he can be in his house if he wants, sucks that he doesn\u2019t want to be accommodating to you but it\u2019s HIS house. Go to the library, park, where ever you like and then turn your phone off, make it clear you NEED this time to yourself.", "YTA. This problem has existed for about five years and you haven\u2019t done the one thing that would solve it - move out. And now leaving a room when he walks in is just making him feel unwanted in his own home. It is more expensive to live alone but it\u2019s worth it to get the space you need. You don\u2019t have to break up, but you should seriously think about whether your relationship has a future if he doesn\u2019t understand your need for space.", "ESH (everyone sucks here), I feel you I also need my alone time to cope w people every now and then but the way you are handling it's very wrong your bf might feel like you are hiding something or are mad towards him. Try to maybe do a hike alone and spend sometime there or maybe go watch a movie somewhere u won't be bother by anyone.\n\nFrom the other side he is also using the ol' reliable \"my house my rules\", okay it's his (it will be \"yours\" when u get married before that it's his gotta acknowledge the difference) house but you also mention u need some alone time to fill ur social patience it could work if BOTH agree at a time to not enter certain rooms or try to evade them for a certain period of time.", "I totally get the need for space, I'm the same way. Like, I generally despise interacting with people. I also live with my girlfriend, who is also very introverted.\n\nI do think that you have some level of responsibility to be considerate of your partner's feelings. Telling him you just need to get out of the house to have some time alone is absolutely valid, my gf does it from time to time and I don't take it personally.\n\nBut making him feel guilty for working from home and/or taking a sick day, or immediately leaving the room whenever he walks in is just plain inconsiderate. I get that you don't feel like interacting with him, but healthy relationships require compromise. Even if it's as much as sticking around for a minute or two and then retreating to another area and telling your boyfriend nicely that you would like to be alone. Maybe consider having \"spaces\" of your own, like your offices. Don't you have an office if you work from home?\n\nBut occupying a common area and then reacting the way you do when he enters it isn't okay. He's right, it is his house too\u2014and he shouldn't feel like he's not welcome there. And I don't blame him for feeling that way. If I were him, I'd feel like I was walking on eggshells whenever I entered my own home, or that I was going to piss you off by entering a place you already were. \n\nI do think it's pretty unreasonable to expect someone to leave a place where you both live so *you* can have alone time. There are other ways of accomplishing this that are less abrasive. Are you sure you don't actually despise this guy? Living together is generally a characteristic of relationships. You might want to reevaluate whether you want to be dating this person, because this isn't a normal way to treat someone you ostensibly care about. So I'd say YTA.", "This is a communication issue", "YTA.  This is SO rude.  You keep trying to kick him out of his house and then when he didn\u2019t then you leave the room?  I can\u2019t imagine he\u2019ll stay with you much longer.  This is NOT how you deal with this.  If you need alone time, carve it out yourself, go for a walk, get a hotel room, etc.  But don\u2019t act like he\u2019s in the way simply for existing in his own house.", "YTA, I can\u2019t believe people are defending you. You are in a relationship with someone. Leaving the room every time they enter makes them feel like something is wrong. This is normal human psychology. If you need that much alone time that you can\u2019t even be in the same room with someone even if they aren\u2019t interacting with you, you need to live alone. It\u2019s not fair to the person you live with. Or you need to have your alone time in a space that isn\u2019t shared. \n\nFYI I am also a person that needs a lot of alone time and it has not been good for my relationships in the past. Most people who want a relationship with someone want to be around that person. They don\u2019t want to have the person get up and leave when they walk in the room.   \nAlso are you planning to have kids? You can say goodbye to alone time.", "NTA and this is ridiculous. This is a you problem. You need a more respectful man. You need a dedicated space. Basically you need a solution because this isn't working.\n\nI have no idea how many rooms you have, but if possible, one needs to be **a dedicated you space**. Close the door, he can't enter. \n\nAlso not sure what is available in your hometown but we have a shared work space. It is like going to Starbucks but with cubicles and no coffee. A cubicle can be rented by the month or the hour. \n\nI rented an office inside a yoga studio for one day a week it was $25 a day and worth every freaking penny. \n\nWe also have a college library which is free to enter and there are some silent remote spots that have wifi.\n\nGOOD LUCK!", "YTA doesn\u2019t sound like you two are compatible. It maybe better if you two lived separately.", "ESH. It really sounds like the two of you aren\u2019t very compatible. I am an extrovert and would be incredibly hurt if my husband left the room every time I entered it. What\u2019s the point of being with him if you don\u2019t like his company? Everyone is concentrating on him not respecting your need for alone time (and it sounds like you need A LOT of alone time) and he\u2019s not by the way, but what about his need for companionship? Why is that any less important? Neither of you is respecting what the other one needs but maybe it\u2019s just not possible to do that and still be happy. Might be time for marriage counseling to see if it\u2019s even salvageable.", "You\u2019re literally conditioning your BF to be insecure and suspicious. Passive aggression and implied intent is not good communication. You need to sit down with him and clearly communicate how and when you need time to yourself. You should make more of an effort to find hobbies away from home too. What you\u2019re doing now will only make him feel like absolute shit. So until you communicate better, YTA", "YTA. I respect your need for space but you live with him, in his place, and you're literally making him feel bad for being in his place. Moreover, he wants to be around you, and you're treating him like an asshole for simply wanting to be near you.\n\nYou guys should take a break, or get some counseling, because this relationship is doomed as it stands.", "YTA\n\nYou moved into you boyfriends house and then want alone space.\n\nThis doesn't really make sense. Also, you seem angry he was WFH on days where you were off--forbid he want to spend time with you or enjoy your presence? \n\nNot really sure why you're in a relationship if you don't like being around the other person most of the time.", "YTA, being in a relationship is a big commitment to be with your partner for the REST of your life. Your partner clearly wants to spend time with you, why don't you want to spend time with him?\n\n>I don\u2019t ask him to leave the space or to stop making noise, I simply remove myself to continue my alone time.\n\nYou sound like you want a roommate, not a partner. You need to have a frank conversation with yourself and think about your priorities in life. Do you love your partner? If so, you need to make some effort to make him feel that you love him. Being introverted is not an excuse to have a one-sided relationship.", "ESH, but him more so than you. It sounds like a communication breakdown - you aren\u2019t communicating your needs clearly and he isn\u2019t understanding your need for space. Instead of just leaving the room without saying anything, start telling him why you are leaving. They way you are going about it sounds like you are ignoring him.", "YTA, you moved into his house and you want him to gtfo so you can have 'you' time.

But it really doesn't seem like that is what's going on.", "The issue here it's not \"spending time w each other\" it's that she has a social patience a bit too low and need alone time to recharge it, the problem is that neither want to \"give up\" something.", "Everyone has a right to some privacy from their partner. If my partner was home all the time and in the same room as me all the time, that would drive me up the wall. If I did that to them, it would drive them up the wall. My partner and I respect one another\u2019s needs for alone time and have conversations and arrange to have together time when it works for both of us.", "Are you... not allowed to want to have alone time anymore when you're in a relationship?? I love my boyfriend but I absolutely dont want to spend every second of my waking life with him. \n\nLike op isn't asking for much... bf is the one completely disrespecting her needs.", "If they would have bought a house together would you say the same thing? They agreed to live together. She wants alone time. Nothing wrong with that. NTA.", "Shes removing herself from the situation... how is that wanting bf to \"gtfo\"?", "You need some kind of a signal for him. If telling him directly doesn\u2019t work (including where to avoid you and for how long), then you either need to find a hobby out of the house or make a space even if it\u2019s a large closet that\u2019s yours. I mean, even having a special \u201cleave me alone\u201d hat would potentially work. But while he compromises for you, you also need to compromise for him in proportion so if he\u2019s clingy and needs physical affection that might mean trying to give extra hugs at other times. If it\u2019s impossible to find a compromise, consider if you guys are compatible in terms of your needs.", "NTA. I totally understand you. My boyfriend moved into my house and he needs to talk A LOT after work but RN here so I deal with people every day. I don\u2019t always need space but when I do I tell him I have had a frustrating day I need some time to myself. When he has a hard time respecting that I tell him again that I need quite time alone and I take a bath\u2026..", "Well yeah, that's why I was leaning towards ESH instead of NTA. If OP was communicating that she wanted alone time, she would be NTA, but just leaving without saying anything and giving up on communicating about it lends itself to ESH.", "I don\u2019t think people understand what it is like to live like this. You literally can\u2019t miss the other person because they are always there and in your business. Your cup is so empty there is no energy for them. And they don\u2019t get it. She\u2019s told him she needs alone time and he didn\u2019t care. One element that maybe even OP doesn\u2019t realize is that she needs *predictable* alone time. She needs to know she has this guaranteed time to herself where she won\u2019t be interrupted and can truly relax and recharge.", "I don't think you have any true understanding about introverts. We NEED alone time to recharge and recover. Having to be in the presence of another person, no matter how much we love them, is tiring and emotionally draining. It has nothing to do with the other person. She has tried to explain this to him, but he REFUSES to understand or accept this. It sounds as if she doesn't have any place that she can go to recharge, so she is coping as best as she can. As far as discussing this before she moved in, before Covid and him working from home, this wasn't an issue. She may need to move out to keep her mental health up.", "This post doesn't sound like \"some privacy\" though. \n\nShe's legitimately angry that the dude worked from home a day a week while she was home.\n\nThat's not healthy behavior.", "I don't think the issue is the fact that she wants alone time\u2014it's the way she's going about it. It sounds like she makes her boyfriend feel guilty for even being in the house, even if he isn't interacting with her. Like he can't take a sick day or work from home without pissing her off.\n\nWhen two people\u2014in a healthy relationship\u2014share a home, one shouldn't have to leave the house whenever the other wants alone time. You can exist in the same house without interacting, and if OP is annoyed by simply being in the same vicinity as her partner, then I question whether she should be living with him\u2014or even be in a relationship with him.\n\nRelationships are about compromise. There are ways of communicating that you want space without making your partner feel unwanted in their own house.", "But the point is , they didn't buy a house together, she moved into his house. She leaves the room when he's in it, she's angry when he's home, in his own house. If she craves her space to the point that she can't bear to be in the same space with him she needs to move to her own apartment where she can regulate how much time she spends with him", ">  and when I mention that it would be nice to have time alone, he dismisses me and says, \"Where would I even go right now?\"\n\nThere. That's where.", "She has explained it to him before and he gets annoyed. He also says he can go where he wants in his house. He doesn\u2019t seem to care that she needs alone time.", "Spot on! I have a different brain than my spouse. I know he doesn\u2019t like to chat early or right after work. I\u2019m a chatty person who loves to know about his day, even though I can\u2019t understand what he does specifically. Were there good snacks? Did that coworker bring a new kind of coffee? But I have a filter so I don\u2019t ask 8 million questions at once. \n\nWe had an ok routine, but it\u2019s so rough the past few months because on top of my being WFH almost exclusively, I\u2019ve been dealing with a lot of new health issues. \n\nI started sleeping on our guest room not to be away from him but know I would not be woken up by a cat, or snoring, or my blankets being pulled off. That predictability has been vital for my sanity. But we\u2019ve never discussed it.", "He worked from home every time she took off to get alone time. Every time.\n\nShe needs space. I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s a terrible thing. It might be an incompatibility thing, but there\u2019s nothing wrong with needing space from people you cohabitate with.", "No, this isn\u2019t a normal level of togetherness. Even back when people were homesteaders, living in the middle of nowhere with few neighbors and both working at home, one of them would be tending the fields or cows or whatever while the other did household stuff. They wouldn\u2019t be up each other\u2019s asses all day. Go all the way back to hunter-gathers and, again, not on top of each other all the time. \n\nIt is not normal for him to be at home all the time. He should have friends or hobbies or something. She shouldn\u2019t be the only person meeting his needs for human interaction. She shouldn\u2019t have to sit in her car to be alone.", "Telling your partner \u201cthis is my house and I\u2019ll do what I want\u201d and refusing to address an issue they brought up is childish behavior. From the post it seems like OP wants a few hours a week to herself. A. Few. Hours. That is not a huge ask.", "u/reasonandmadness, don't bother trying to explain, it's redditland, reading comprehension and commonsense are issues here lol.", "I know she's explained it before. The solution isn't to stop communicating, it's to either figure out a better way of communicating or recognize that the relationship isn't working. Ignoring it does nothing but make the problem worse.", "Frequently, yet we're the assholes.", "Agreed, he just doesn\u2019t respect her need for space. I\u2019m lucky in my case as I can leave the room without saying anything but my husband knows it\u2019s nothing against him."]}
