I moved into his house after a year dating. He works a M-F, 9-5 job, I take contract work and my days/hours vary week to week. I'm an introvert, but I work with lots of people and basically always have to be \"on\" at work, so I absolutely require time to myself to recharge. \n\nEarly on living together, I liked to plan one of my days off on a weekday so I could have the house to myself. But frequently, he\u2019d choose to work from home or take a sick day on that day, and I would get frustrated when he didn't leave for work that day. When I expressed this frustration, he'd get annoyed/angry. I told him that I just need time to myself occasionally, it honestly has nothing to do with him, and he responded \"How could it not have anything to do with me, you just told me you don't want to be around me. Plus this is my house, I will be here when I want to be.\" I adapted and got used to living with less alone time for myself.\n \nThings changed during the pandemic, He now works from home every day. He gave up some of his hobbies as well, and it feels like he never leaves the house anymore. I still work contract work out of the house, but I know that I will have virtually no time that is truly to myself when I'm home. I do all the grocery shopping and lots of other errands as a means to be alone with myself, between the drive and the shopping time. Sometimes I just sit in my car in the parking lot, or in the garage, for like an hour in total silence when I drive somewhere. Sometimes he wonders what has taken me so long, and I tell him that I just took my time with the errand.\n \nBut I still need space because I feel drained all the time now, and when I mention that it would be nice to have time alone, he dismisses me and says, \"Where would I even go right now?\"\n \nNow I frequently wear earbuds around the house (sometimes not even playing anything) to cancel out some noise. If I'm in a room alone, and he enters without an obvious plan to interact with me, I\u2019ll get up and move to a different room where I can continue to be by myself. Ex: if I'm sitting on the couch in the living room, and he enters the kitchen right next to me and plays a podcast on the echo and starts making food, I don't ask him to turn off the podcast or leave, I just silently get up and move to the office. Or if he comes into the office, maybe I\u2019ll go down to the basement and sit on the laundry table. I don\u2019t ask him to leave the space or to stop making noise, I simply remove myself to continue my alone time.\n \nSometimes, he thinks I'm being passive aggressive or mad at him and gets frustrated with me. As far as I'm concerned, I have expressed my need to have space, and if he can\u2019t understand, that's on him. I see it as a compromise to have my alone time and meet his needs as well.\n \nSo AITA for creating my alone time by whatever means necessary?\n\nEdit for clarity:\n-I work out of the house 2 jobs 60-70 hrs per week. Lots of human interaction at both. He works from home full time since Covid. \n-To clarify, I don\u2019t leave the room *every time* he walks in. It\u2019s once or twice per week when he comes into the space I have specifically put myself in to be alone, almost always when I get home from work, after saying hi and checking in. For example: \u201cHey, how was your day?\u201d That\u2019s great, my day was super busy. So, I\u2019m heading back downstairs to relax while you finish your work day. Still want tacos for dinner, yeah? Cool, let\u2019s eat at 5:30 before I leave [for job 2]\u201d\n-If he comes down to interact with me, talk to me, help me with whatever I\u2019m working on, then I stay and hang out with him. But when he\u2019s just making noise in the room when he knows I\u2019m trying to quietly relax, I do relocate sometimes.\n\nEdit 2:\n-Not sure where the idea came from that I live for free in his house and frankly I\u2019m not sure why its relevant. We split all expenses based on our income ratio, I pay 45% and he pays 55% of all expenses, including mortgage, insurance, utilities, internet, groceries, house & yard maintenance, etc.\n-I also really enjoy cooking as a hobby and have some dietary needs so I do nearly all the grocery shopping, cooking, meal prep- breakfast, lunch, and dinner to cover both our meals for about 5 of the days a week. \n\nProbably done responding now. Thanks to all for all the feedback, it\u2019s been very helpful and insightful, and I appreciate all the different perspectives.

Because his response is that he feels he shouldn't have to leave his home (understandable). \n\nSo is this simply alone time or alone time in the house", "You\u2019re NTA for needing time to yourself, but you need to take a long look in the mirror and ask if this is a relationship that is sustainable. You have to very clearly communicate what you need from your partner and come up with solutions together. And if he can\u2019t compromise with you for your benefit, this is not the relationship for you. Respecting your partners need for space is absolutely necessary. I myself do not need to spend every moment with my partner, and he is very much like your boyfriend. I just had to tell him that I needed time to myself when we were home. He could play his games, I could watch tv in the living room or read, but I couldn\u2019t entertain him all the time.", "ESH.\n\nYou both need better communication skills. Tell him outright that you need to be alone and set boundaries for yourself. Maybe set up a day with him where he knows to leave you the hell alone.", "ESH. It doesn't sound like he is really respecting your needs for alone time, which you've communicated. Ultimately the way you're going about dealing with it is also passive aggressive and I can see why it's frustrating for him as well. If my partner did these things all the time I would be frustrated too. \n\nIt does sound like a LOT of your time is spent wanting to be alone, which may not be compatible with cohabitating. Do you have any friends or hobbies that get you out of the house, or is it just work and errands? I don't think you can just be mad at him for being in his own home, especially when it's his work location.", "ESH. This should have been discussed before you ever moved in together. You can\u2019t count on having alone time/space in shared spaces (your example of him coming to the kitchen to cook- that\u2019s an entirely reasonable thing for him to do.) it sounds like you two should consider a home that has one more room so there are two living spaces, or carving out a corner of the bedroom for a space where you can hang out that isn\u2019t in the common areas. This was a predictable, and therefore preventable conflict. If you can\u2019t come to a mutual understanding I would seriously consider if you want to be in a relationship where one person leaves the room every time the other one enters.", "NTA. He is for not letting you have some time to yourself. It's a perfectly reasonable, and perfectly normal, request.\nHe makes it about him and ignores your needs.\n\nYou're going to go crazy if you guys don't work this out. If he won't accept that you need some space, do you really want to spend the rest of your life sitting in your car in the garage every time you need to be alone?", "ESH because your BF should be letting you have space, but leaving the room when he comes in isn't sustainable either because it doesn't actually solve the problem of him not respecting your need for alone time. It sounds like you're incompatible, and if you are compatible, there's some serious communication that needs to happen.", "i\u2019m the exact same\nway as you. I don\u2019t think i can ever live with a partner, because my alone time needs are so high.", "Definitely NTA. It sounds like he literally never leaves the house. That would drive me crazy. Can you maybe do a staycation by yourself?", "ESH cos I get that you want ur space and he should give u that on occasion, maybe make the effort to go out and see a friend or family and even stay with them. However the more I read I couldn't just help feeling do u even like the guy or are u kinda over this relationship? Sounds kinda like ur sick of his presence.", "NTA.", "NTA but you definitely need to find a way to talk to him. I'm like you, but fortunately I work in my own office so I get out of the house for that alone time. Even sometimes at home I'll sleep in a different bedroom when I need to be alone, usually when work stress is high. \n\nIt took some time for my GF to adjust, but we communicated well on the subject, and she knows when I need the space and respects it. Your BF needs to learn the same otherwise it'll just end in conflict.", "Info needed: if he\u2019s working from home, where is his work space? Does he have his own \u201coffice\u201d room in the house? Do you?", "NTA.  I am an introvert as well and know exactly where you are coming from.  He simply doesn\u2019t understand what being an introvert means.  I\u2019m not sure of the exact way to get him to but I\u2019d start with a conversation.  Tell him you absolutely love and adore him but alone time is how you recharge.  Explain how exhausting it can be to have to be \u201con\u201d all the time and it wouldn\u2019t matter if it was your mom, your best friend, him or anyone.  Then work out a day or days and times when you can have that time.  It might be 4 days, an hour each or 2 days, 3 hours each, whatever.  If that doesn\u2019t work I\u2019d try to get him to go to couples therapy. It might take a third person to get the message across.", "NTA but take some time to consider what you\u2019re getting from this relationship and if that\u2019s worth your loss of alone time. If it isn\u2019t, you need to have a frank conversation with him. Partners should be understanding of one another\u2019s needs and he isn\u2019t being understanding of yours, but you need to be consistent in your communication with him.", "Your BF just doesn\u2019t *get* that you need some alone time. \n\nIf you want to keep living with him in \u201chis house\u201d, you need an offsite \u201coffice\u201d or something. For you to \u201cwork\u201d in. It doesn\u2019t matter if the \u201cwork\u201d you are doing is on seeing to your own comfort.  He doesn\u2019t  need to know that, and he wouldn\u2019t understand if you were to try to explain it.  NTA", "ESH sounds like you are growing to hate your bf. Wearing earphones around the house with nothing playing to actively avoid him is pretty insane. He does need to respect that you need alone time so he is definitely quite the ah there too. After while I would say most would construe behavior of effectively avoiding your loved one like that as genuine dislike for them. The second to last paragraph especially makes it sound like you do everything you can to avoid basic interactions with the person you supposedly love. Therapy or some hard thoughts about this relationship are required I\u2019d say because this will only lead to him, rightfully so, being angry about it and you never really getting the alone time you need.", "OHHMYYGAAWDD I had to deal with this on a smaller level with my BF (we don't live together). I had to explain that Mondays are my downtime. I'm recovering from the weekend AND that's usually my busiest work day so as soon as I sign off I'm basically a zombie and do not want to interact in any way shape or form with anybody. It's been a problem. He's felt hurt by it/doesn't understand, etc. I've begged- even if you don't understand it can you please just give me this and not take it personally. It's still a struggle.", "YTA. Unless you\u2019re living in a mansion you\u2019re sharing space. If you want solitude, live alone.", "NTA. As an introvert, I get this so much. Your bf is not respecting a basic need for down time, and he's trying to emotionally manipulate you to force you to spend time with him when you clearly need time by yourself. Given that you've already tried to talk about it and he's refused to work with your need for more time alone, to the point that you're constantly drained and struggling mentally, I would strongly consider looking into a we-work office or some sort of rental space where you can be alone for some time each week, at least while working. If that doesn't work, you may need to reevaluate this relationship.", "ESH, instead of being at the house just making things worse for both of you, why don\u2019t you sit him down, reexplain why you need down time, and then find somewhere else to go for your day off? Obviously he can be in his house if he wants, sucks that he doesn\u2019t want to be accommodating to you but it\u2019s HIS house. Go to the library, park, where ever you like and then turn your phone off, make it clear you NEED this time to yourself.", "YTA. This problem has existed for about five years and you haven\u2019t done the one thing that would solve it - move out. And now leaving a room when he walks in is just making him feel unwanted in his own home. It is more expensive to live alone but it\u2019s worth it to get the space you need. You don\u2019t have to break up, but you should seriously think about whether your relationship has a future if he doesn\u2019t understand your need for space.", "ESH (everyone sucks here), I feel you I also need my alone time to cope w people every now and then but the way you are handling it's very wrong your bf might feel like you are hiding something or are mad towards him. Try to maybe do a hike alone and spend sometime there or maybe go watch a movie somewhere u won't be bother by anyone.\n\nFrom the other side he is also using the ol' reliable \"my house my rules\", okay it's his (it will be \"yours\" when u get married before that it's his gotta acknowledge the difference) house but you also mention u need some alone time to fill ur social patience it could work if BOTH agree at a time to not enter certain rooms or try to evade them for a certain period of time.", "I totally get the need for space, I'm the same way. Like, I generally despise interacting with people. I also live with my girlfriend, who is also very introverted.\n\nI do think that you have some level of responsibility to be considerate of your partner's feelings. Telling him you just need to get out of the house to have some time alone is absolutely valid, my gf does it from time to time and I don't take it personally.\n\nBut making him feel guilty for working from home and/or taking a sick day, or immediately leaving the room whenever he walks in is just plain inconsiderate. I get that you don't feel like interacting with him, but healthy relationships require compromise. Even if it's as much as sticking around for a minute or two and then retreating to another area and telling your boyfriend nicely that you would like to be alone. Maybe consider having \"spaces\" of your own, like your offices. Don't you have an office if you work from home?\n\nBut occupying a common area and then reacting the way you do when he enters it isn't okay. He's right, it is his house too\u2014and he shouldn't feel like he's not welcome there. And I don't blame him for feeling that way. If I were him, I'd feel like I was walking on eggshells whenever I entered my own home, or that I was going to piss you off by entering a place you already were. \n\nI do think it's pretty unreasonable to expect someone to leave a place where you both live so *you* can have alone time. There are other ways of accomplishing this that are less abrasive. Are you sure you don't actually despise this guy? Living together is generally a characteristic of relationships. You might want to reevaluate whether you want to be dating this person, because this isn't a normal way to treat someone you ostensibly care about. So I'd say YTA.", "This is a communication issue", "YTA.  This is SO rude.  You keep trying to kick him out of his house and then when he didn\u2019t then you leave the room?  I can\u2019t imagine he\u2019ll stay with you much longer.  This is NOT how you deal with this.  If you need alone time, carve it out yourself, go for a walk, get a hotel room, etc.  But don\u2019t act like he\u2019s in the way simply for existing in his own house.", "YTA, I can\u2019t believe people are defending you. You are in a relationship with someone. Leaving the room every time they enter makes them feel like something is wrong. This is normal human psychology. If you need that much alone time that you can\u2019t even be in the same room with someone even if they aren\u2019t interacting with you, you need to live alone. It\u2019s not fair to the person you live with. Or you need to have your alone time in a space that isn\u2019t shared. \n\nFYI I am also a person that needs a lot of alone time and it has not been good for my relationships in the past. Most people who want a relationship with someone want to be around that person. They don\u2019t want to have the person get up and leave when they walk in the room.   \nAlso are you planning to have kids? You can say goodbye to alone time.", "NTA and this is ridiculous. This is a you problem. You need a more respectful man. You need a dedicated space. Basically you need a solution because this isn't working.\n\nI have no idea how many rooms you have, but if possible, one needs to be **a dedicated you space**. Close the door, he can't enter. \n\nAlso not sure what is available in your hometown but we have a shared work space. It is like going to Starbucks but with cubicles and no coffee. A cubicle can be rented by the month or the hour. \n\nI rented an office inside a yoga studio for one day a week it was $25 a day and worth every freaking penny. \n\nWe also have a college library which is free to enter and there are some silent remote spots that have wifi.\n\nGOOD LUCK!", "YTA doesn\u2019t sound like you two are compatible. It maybe better if you two lived separately.", "ESH. It really sounds like the two of you aren\u2019t very compatible. I am an extrovert and would be incredibly hurt if my husband left the room every time I entered it. What\u2019s the point of being with him if you don\u2019t like his company? Everyone is concentrating on him not respecting your need for alone time (and it sounds like you need A LOT of alone time) and he\u2019s not by the way, but what about his need for companionship? Why is that any less important? Neither of you is respecting what the other one needs but maybe it\u2019s just not possible to do that and still be happy. Might be time for marriage counseling to see if it\u2019s even salvageable.", "You\u2019re literally conditioning your BF to be insecure and suspicious. Passive aggression and implied intent is not good communication. You need to sit down with him and clearly communicate how and when you need time to yourself.

I respect your need for space but you live with him, in his place, and you're literally making him feel bad for being in his place. Moreover, he wants to be around you, and you're treating him like an asshole for simply wanting to be near you.\n\nYou guys should take a break, or get some counseling, because this relationship is doomed as it stands.", "YTA\n\nYou moved into you boyfriends house and then want alone space.\n\nThis doesn't really make sense. Also, you seem angry he was WFH on days where you were off--forbid he want to spend time with you or enjoy your presence? \n\nNot really sure why you're in a relationship if you don't like being around the other person most of the time.", "YTA, being in a relationship is a big commitment to be with your partner for the REST of your life. Your partner clearly wants to spend time with you, why don't you want to spend time with him?\n\n>I don\u2019t ask him to leave the space or to stop making noise, I simply remove myself to continue my alone time.\n\nYou sound like you want a roommate, not a partner. You need to have a frank conversation with yourself and think about your priorities in life. Do you love your partner? If so, you need to make some effort to make him feel that you love him. Being introverted is not an excuse to have a one-sided relationship.", "ESH, but him more so than you. It sounds like a communication breakdown - you aren\u2019t communicating your needs clearly and he isn\u2019t understanding your need for space. Instead of just leaving the room without saying anything, start telling him why you are leaving.

If I\u2019m in the living room and my husband comes in to watch TV, I don\u2019t take it as him invading my space, I take it as him wanting to be near me because he\u2019s gets to work from home and as an extrovert he needs company and we love spending time together. If I feel like staying I will, but otherwise, I\u2019ll get up and hang out in the bedroom. I guess the difference is my hubby doesn\u2019t complain or get mad at me as he understands our differences.\n\nEdit for grammar", "I agree with you on this.

I mean, even having a special \u201cleave me alone\u201d hat would potentially work.

He needs to understand that it's not a *him* thing, it's a *anyone* thing.

Which I do agree with to a degree but I do sometimes like my alone time.  Me and him have been together going on 4 years. We spend all weekend together and maybe a weeknight together every few weeks.  He's a mechanic so he doesn't have to deal with people, whereas I'm in customer service and sales.  He's said many times he admires my ability to interact with people.  He HATES  with a major passion making small talk and refuses to do it.  There's been times he's ask me not to come over on the weekend as he needs alone time. Which to him 90% of the time means he's out on the boat fishing lol. (Before anyone gets the idea he's off cheating and just using alone time to cover it up, I know he's not as he'll randomly send me a pic of the moonlight on the water, a catfish he'd caught or whatnot.)  Which I respect and leave him alone.  Or he may text me and tell me to not be bugging him when I get there, which I understand as I do talk and ramble on a lot.  So when I get there I'll normally give him a kiss and go play with the cats or find a spot to chill out and read or play on my phone.  Then when he's ready for interaction he'll either come find me and start communicating or text me asking questions or such letting me know he's finished his alone time.

It surely doesn't feel good to see someone you love (and who you may be trying to be physically close to, even if just within your eyesight) move away from you all the time. I totally understand your needs, because I have those needs too, but we can't ignore what may feel like significant disinterest from his perspective.\n\nHe doesn't have his usual outings (presumably with friends or at least with other humans present) anymore. His down-time is now whittled down to all the time you have together, which is all day, but you may be chasing the need to be totally alone when YOU have down time, which overlaps with his down time.

He could kick me out tomorrow if he wanted, I have no legal right to stay here.\n\nBut it was a bit of a slap in the face when he said that to me (and this was years ago, but it felt relevant to this situation). It was hurtful because he invited me to live in his house, and that makes it our \u201chome\u201d. And I told him that it was hurtful at the time and he hasn\u2019t said anything like that since.

When I am very drained and intentionally spending time quietly in my own space, which happens the same time after work each day, if he comes to the room and puts on a podcast or turns on the tv, I move upstairs.

He got mad when I shared my frustration about this. And of course, this was a long time ago, pre-Covid\u2014 I mentioned it for context. \n\nOur house is one big shared space so he does sometimes barge in. I don\u2019t have any room to myself.

Plus this is my house, I will be here when I want to be.\"\n\nI think it's unfair to say the OP didn't state just that. The partner chose to make it personal, and then lorded his ownership of the space over her as a means of control. Effectively saying \"You don't have the right to have that need met if I don't want you to, because I own this space.\"", "I don't think using the activities of homesteaders or hunter-gatherers to justify how one should behave in contemporary society is even remotely valid, do you?

Why is it normal for OP to be home all the time, but not normal for bf to do the same? Why should her bf be the one who has to go into an office or leave the house for no reason other than to give her space? Why can't she get more hobbies or rent an office to work out of, since she's the one that hates being home after all? It isn't fair to expect him to stay out of the house when she is home just as much. It's a glaring double standard.\n\nShe doesn't need to play with him all the time or have deep conversations constantly. She just needs to share a living space. But it is clear from the post that she is annoyed by his mere presence\u2014so much as him making a passing comment to her or entering the same room pisses her off. It doesn't seem like he's constantly asking her to play board games or something. Plus, they're both working a significant part of the week, so it's not like they're talking all day\u2014and it doesn't seem like he's talking to her when she's trying to work.\n\nPlenty of couples have happy relationships when they both work from home. My boss and her husband do. I work 100% remotely, and my partner is in grad school, so she is home 90% of the time.

Gas money, food, drinks, and entertainment aren't free. He's going to have to go out and spend money when he really just wants to relax at home.\n\nLeaving the room when he enters probably makes him feel really bad. You said you explained to him why, but it probably still makes him feel bad and awkward. You make it sound like the house is pretty small. There's only so much he can do to give you space.

I need less alone time than my husband does, and it IS hard to not take it personally when you\u2019re just living your life in your shared spaces and the person who loves you can\u2019t handle you just existing in the same place.", "\ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Me, too. This post really resonated with me. I go for a walk/run to get my time. And I\u2019m lucky to live in a place where outside is almost always accessible, weather-wise.", "I mean does she need the whole house alone though? If he\u2019s working from home then she had several rooms of the house to use while he\u2019s working. Its insane to think you have to have an empty house to be alone", "No one has a right to ask someone to leave their home. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t need to leave the house completely for her to be alone. \n\nNAH.", "I feel like I'm taking crazy pills with all these ESH replies.\n\nOP has clearly communicated her needs, multiple times, and he ignored them and belittled her. Now he's upset that his lack of consideration for *her* needs is affecting *him* because she actively avoids him.\n\nThere is no universe where OP is the A H for needing alone time and trying to find it any way she can get it after he dismissed her so completely.", "She doesn't need therapy, she just needs some personal space in her own home. That's not even asking much.", "Sorry, but no. The bf is holding OP's time hostage because he can't accept that OP has different needs to his. He's being an AH and making her her get burned out because he thinks he knows better and doesn't want to leave people alone.", "Like, literally alone time at home, where she can have some peace & quiet time to recharge. As an introvert,  you have to recharge, and that's done with alone time. No people, at all. That's why you have to recharge, people and interactions, and it's just exhausting!\n\nSo, not going out to the nail salon, to get a massage, or where any people are, even the ones you love. Before my hubby \"got it,\" I would honestly have to go sit and recharge at a cemetery. Peaceful, quiet, no one to bother me. Ahhhhhh.... but it is more relaxing to get that at your home. You're comfortable at home, or you should be, if people would just stop trying to be in your space all.the.time.", "You are NTA! I get it. Took my hubby a while to get it. And trust me, he now knows because I am so tense/stressed he can see it in my face. So he's like, want to go lie down, read, craft? Because those are all things I can do in another room. It's okay to need that time, and it's okay to take it.", "OP, he does not understand your needs. Everything else is kind of irrelevant. I don\u2019t have any advice because my while my needs are similar but husband listened when I asked for space, and it made such a big difference. I am a better version of myself when I get recharge time. What if you said \u201chey for the next X hours I would like to be by myself in this area\u201d would that help? If you gave clear parameters around how long you\u2019ll be doing your own thing? It doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s malicious or anything, just that he doesn\u2019t understand. \n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY!!! Have you heard of Loop earplugs? They\u2019re constantly discussed in ADHD groups because they\u2019re great and most of us need to regulate stimulation. Their flagship product was designed to minimize sound by about 25% so you can still hear things and talk to people but it puts a bit of a buffer in between and it\u2019s fantastic.", "> does the bf explicitly know that OP was in that room because she wanted alone time?\n\nProbably not.  He's offended by the very idea that OP needs time alone, so telling him that will only lead to an argument, which is the exact opposite of what OP is trying to accomplish.", "I mean, technically he can't just kick you out. You live there and you have renter's rights. \n\nBut it's a pretty big red flag that he threatened you with that. Housing insecurity is no joke and that was incredibly cruel. \n\nI'm glad you've worked through that situation but that paired with him refusing to understand or acquiesce to your need of alone time makes me wonder if he lacks empathy and emotional intelligence or even kindness.\n\nETA: I just remembered that he used to also WFH on the days you purposefully took off to recharge. This dude is not it.", "I just wanted to comment you're a very polite and understanding person, especially with these comments. NTA and I agree covid has messed up my own alone time while living with my partner of the last 10 years", "Season 2, Episode 7 Headspace. I suggest watching it together ;)", "In the second sentence of the post", "I\u2019ve fantasised about an \u201con air\u201d sign like at a radio station, that means no one can come into the room and make noise", "The thing is, she needs to tell him expressedly every time she wants alone time, like \"for the next hour I'm going to be in the office for some alone time, please don't come in during this time if you don't need to.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether or not she did this every time. If she just \"adapted\" and started avoiding him any time she needs alone time, I can see why he would take that as passive aggressiveness.", "People are trained to see emotional abuse as healthy and normal, tbh.", "Well, she kind of has a signal, leaving the room.", "So she\u2019s working 60-70 hours a week and contributing to the bills, but she\u2019s not allowed to be in the house alone because he happened to live there first?", "He\u2019ll probably give her this is my house I\u2019ll go where I want to go she stated she has told  and requested time to herself and he constantly dismisses her u can\u2019t tell somebody what they don\u2019t want to her", "But him dismissing and guilting her and refusing to accommodate her at all, causing her to have to adapt in the first place, is healthy communication?", "Introvert here. Like OP, I need to recharge my social batteries often, but my roommate is more social and likes to come interact with me when she's \"bored.\" I've had meltdowns when my battery is so drained and I don't have anywhere or any way to be alone and recharge. No amount of \"leave me alone\" helps with some people. If they're more social and feed off that social energy, the concept of being alone is not something they understand.\n\nI'm going with NTA, because OP is doing what they can to get the time to recharge and be able to function. Having meltdowns is absolutely no fun, and causes more harm than good. Thankfully, my roommate and I have a fairly large house and she's come to understand my need to be alone and found ways to be more social without me.", "If that isn't the gospel truth, idk what is", "> I think that people take it better when you frame it as \"I would like this thing\"\n\nOP tried that already.\n\n> I told him that I just need time to myself occasionally, it honestly has nothing to do with him", "She did that. He isn't allowing her the alone time she NEEDS (it isn't a want, it's a need for introverts).", "Oh, lol I\u2019m totally on OP\u2019s side\u2026. You just asked where it said it\u2019s \u201chis\u201d house, and OP classified it as that specifically in the second sentence of their post. I was literally telling you where to find the information you asked for ?", "Yeah. But I can definitely see the difference between \u201chey BF I\u2019d like to give mediation a try!\u201d Versus, \u201cI need time to myself.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a great idea, thanks for this, I\u2019m going to try it."]}
