I moved into his house after a year dating. He works a M-F, 9-5 job, I take contract work and my days/hours vary week to week. I'm an introvert, but I work with lots of people and basically always have to be \"on\" at work, so I absolutely require time to myself to recharge. \n\nEarly on living together, I liked to plan one of my days off on a weekday so I could have the house to myself. But frequently, he\u2019d choose to work from home or take a sick day on that day, and I would get frustrated when he didn't leave for work that day. When I expressed this frustration, he'd get annoyed/angry. I told him that I just need time to myself occasionally, it honestly has nothing to do with him, and he responded \"How could it not have anything to do with me, you just told me you don't want to be around me. Plus this is my house, I will be here when I want to be.\" I adapted and got used to living with less alone time for myself.\n \nThings changed during the pandemic, He now works from home every day. He gave up some of his hobbies as well, and it feels like he never leaves the house anymore. I still work contract work out of the house, but I know that I will have virtually no time that is truly to myself when I'm home. I do all the grocery shopping and lots of other errands as a means to be alone with myself, between the drive and the shopping time. Sometimes I just sit in my car in the parking lot, or in the garage, for like an hour in total silence when I drive somewhere. Sometimes he wonders what has taken me so long, and I tell him that I just took my time with the errand.\n \nBut I still need space because I feel drained all the time now, and when I mention that it would be nice to have time alone, he dismisses me and says, \"Where would I even go right now?\"\n \nNow I frequently wear earbuds around the house (sometimes not even playing anything) to cancel out some noise. If I'm in a room alone, and he enters without an obvious plan to interact with me, I\u2019ll get up and move to a different room where I can continue to be by myself. Ex: if I'm sitting on the couch in the living room, and he enters the kitchen right next to me and plays a podcast on the echo and starts making food, I don't ask him to turn off the podcast or leave, I just silently get up and move to the office. Or if he comes into the office, maybe I\u2019ll go down to the basement and sit on the laundry table. I don\u2019t ask him to leave the space or to stop making noise, I simply remove myself to continue my alone time.\n \nSometimes, he thinks I'm being passive aggressive or mad at him and gets frustrated with me. As far as I'm concerned, I have expressed my need to have space, and if he can\u2019t understand, that's on him. I see it as a compromise to have my alone time and meet his needs as well.\n \nSo AITA for creating my alone time by whatever means necessary?\n\nEdit for clarity:\n-I work out of the house 2 jobs 60-70 hrs per week. Lots of human interaction at both. He works from home full time since Covid. \n-To clarify, I don\u2019t leave the room *every time* he walks in. It\u2019s once or twice per week when he comes into the space I have specifically put myself in to be alone, almost always when I get home from work, after saying hi and checking in. For example: \u201cHey, how was your day?\u201d That\u2019s great, my day was super busy. So, I\u2019m heading back downstairs to relax while you finish your work day. Still want tacos for dinner, yeah? Cool, let\u2019s eat at 5:30 before I leave [for job 2]\u201d\n-If he comes down to interact with me, talk to me, help me with whatever I\u2019m working on, then I stay and hang out with him. But when he\u2019s just making noise in the room when he knows I\u2019m trying to quietly relax, I do relocate sometimes.\n\nEdit 2:\n-Not sure where the idea came from that I live for free in his house and frankly I\u2019m not sure why its relevant. We split all expenses based on our income ratio, I pay 45% and he pays 55% of all expenses, including mortgage, insurance, utilities, internet, groceries, house & yard maintenance, etc.\n-I also really enjoy cooking as a hobby and have some dietary needs so I do nearly all the grocery shopping, cooking, meal prep- breakfast, lunch, and dinner to cover both our meals for about 5 of the days a week. \n\nProbably done responding now. Thanks to all for all the feedback, it\u2019s been very helpful and insightful, and I appreciate all the different perspectives.

Because his response is that he feels he shouldn't have to leave his home (understandable). \n\nSo is this simply alone time or alone time in the house", "You\u2019re NTA for needing time to yourself, but you need to take a long look in the mirror and ask if this is a relationship that is sustainable. You have to very clearly communicate what you need from your partner and come up with solutions together. And if he can\u2019t compromise with you for your benefit, this is not the relationship for you. Respecting your partners need for space is absolutely necessary. I myself do not need to spend every moment with my partner, and he is very much like your boyfriend. I just had to tell him that I needed time to myself when we were home. He could play his games, I could watch tv in the living room or read, but I couldn\u2019t entertain him all the time.", "ESH.\n\nYou both need better communication skills. Tell him outright that you need to be alone and set boundaries for yourself. Maybe set up a day with him where he knows to leave you the hell alone.", "ESH. It doesn't sound like he is really respecting your needs for alone time, which you've communicated. Ultimately the way you're going about dealing with it is also passive aggressive and I can see why it's frustrating for him as well. If my partner did these things all the time I would be frustrated too. \n\nIt does sound like a LOT of your time is spent wanting to be alone, which may not be compatible with cohabitating. Do you have any friends or hobbies that get you out of the house, or is it just work and errands? I don't think you can just be mad at him for being in his own home, especially when it's his work location.", "ESH. This should have been discussed before you ever moved in together. You can\u2019t count on having alone time/space in shared spaces (your example of him coming to the kitchen to cook- that\u2019s an entirely reasonable thing for him to do.) it sounds like you two should consider a home that has one more room so there are two living spaces, or carving out a corner of the bedroom for a space where you can hang out that isn\u2019t in the common areas. This was a predictable, and therefore preventable conflict. If you can\u2019t come to a mutual understanding I would seriously consider if you want to be in a relationship where one person leaves the room every time the other one enters.", "NTA. He is for not letting you have some time to yourself. It's a perfectly reasonable, and perfectly normal, request.\nHe makes it about him and ignores your needs.\n\nYou're going to go crazy if you guys don't work this out. If he won't accept that you need some space, do you really want to spend the rest of your life sitting in your car in the garage every time you need to be alone?", "ESH because your BF should be letting you have space, but leaving the room when he comes in isn't sustainable either because it doesn't actually solve the problem of him not respecting your need for alone time. It sounds like you're incompatible, and if you are compatible, there's some serious communication that needs to happen.", "i\u2019m the exact same\nway as you. I don\u2019t think i can ever live with a partner, because my alone time needs are so high.", "Definitely NTA. It sounds like he literally never leaves the house. That would drive me crazy. Can you maybe do a staycation by yourself?", "ESH cos I get that you want ur space and he should give u that on occasion, maybe HE should make the effort to go out and see a friend or family and even stay with them. However the more I read I couldn't just help feeling do u even like the guy or are u kinda over this relationship? Sounds kinda like ur sick of his presence. (Edited for clarity)", "NTA.", "NTA but you definitely need to find a way to talk to him. I'm like you, but fortunately I work in my own office so I get out of the house for that alone time. Even sometimes at home I'll sleep in a different bedroom when I need to be alone, usually when work stress is high. \n\nIt took some time for my GF to adjust, but we communicated well on the subject, and she knows when I need the space and respects it. Your BF needs to learn the same otherwise it'll just end in conflict.", "Info needed: if he\u2019s working from home, where is his work space? Does he have his own \u201coffice\u201d room in the house? Do you?", "NTA.  I am an introvert as well and know exactly where you are coming from.  He simply doesn\u2019t understand what being an introvert means.  I\u2019m not sure of the exact way to get him to but I\u2019d start with a conversation.  Tell him you absolutely love and adore him but alone time is how you recharge.  Explain how exhausting it can be to have to be \u201con\u201d all the time and it wouldn\u2019t matter if it was your mom, your best friend, him or anyone.  Then work out a day or days and times when you can have that time.  It might be 4 days, an hour each or 2 days, 3 hours each, whatever.  If that doesn\u2019t work I\u2019d try to get him to go to couples therapy. It might take a third person to get the message across.", "NTA but take some time to consider what you\u2019re getting from this relationship and if that\u2019s worth your loss of alone time. If it isn\u2019t, you need to have a frank conversation with him. Partners should be understanding of one another\u2019s needs and he isn\u2019t being understanding of yours, but you need to be consistent in your communication with him.", "Your BF just doesn\u2019t *get* that you need some alone time. \n\nIf you want to keep living with him in \u201chis house\u201d, you need an offsite \u201coffice\u201d or something. For you to \u201cwork\u201d in. It doesn\u2019t matter if the \u201cwork\u201d you are doing is on seeing to your own comfort.

Wearing earphones around the house with nothing playing to actively avoid him is pretty insane. He does need to respect that you need alone time so he is definitely quite the ah there too. After while I would say most would construe behavior of effectively avoiding your loved one like that as genuine dislike for them. The second to last paragraph especially makes it sound like you do everything you can to avoid basic interactions with the person you supposedly love. Therapy or some hard thoughts about this relationship are required I\u2019d say because this will only lead to him, rightfully so, being angry about it and you never really getting the alone time you need.", "OHHMYYGAAWDD I had to deal with this on a smaller level with my BF (we don't live together). I had to explain that Mondays are my downtime. I'm recovering from the weekend AND that's usually my busiest work day so as soon as I sign off I'm basically a zombie and do not want to interact in any way shape or form with anybody. It's been a problem. He's felt hurt by it/doesn't understand, etc. I've begged- even if you don't understand it can you please just give me this and not take it personally. It's still a struggle.", "YTA. Unless you\u2019re living in a mansion you\u2019re sharing space. If you want solitude, live alone.", "NTA. As an introvert, I get this so much. Your bf is not respecting a basic need for down time, and he's trying to emotionally manipulate you to force you to spend time with him when you clearly need time by yourself. Given that you've already tried to talk about it and he's refused to work with your need for more time alone, to the point that you're constantly drained and struggling mentally, I would strongly consider looking into a we-work office or some sort of rental space where you can be alone for some time each week, at least while working. If that doesn't work, you may need to reevaluate this relationship.", "ESH, instead of being at the house just making things worse for both of you, why don\u2019t you sit him down, reexplain why you need down time, and then find somewhere else to go for your day off? Obviously he can be in his house if he wants, sucks that he doesn\u2019t want to be accommodating to you but it\u2019s HIS house. Go to the library, park, where ever you like and then turn your phone off, make it clear you NEED this time to yourself.", "YTA. This problem has existed for about five years and you haven\u2019t done the one thing that would solve it - move out. And now leaving a room when he walks in is just making him feel unwanted in his own home. It is more expensive to live alone but it\u2019s worth it to get the space you need. You don\u2019t have to break up, but you should seriously think about whether your relationship has a future if he doesn\u2019t understand your need for space.", "ESH (everyone sucks here), I feel you I also need my alone time to cope w people every now and then but the way you are handling it's very wrong your bf might feel like you are hiding something or are mad towards him. Try to maybe do a hike alone and spend sometime there or maybe go watch a movie somewhere u won't be bother by anyone.\n\nFrom the other side he is also using the ol' reliable \"my house my rules\", okay it's his (it will be \"yours\" when u get married before that it's his gotta acknowledge the difference) house but you also mention u need some alone time to fill ur social patience it could work if BOTH agree at a time to not enter certain rooms or try to evade them for a certain period of time.", "I totally get the need for space, I'm the same way. Like, I generally despise interacting with people. I also live with my girlfriend, who is also very introverted.\n\nI do think that you have some level of responsibility to be considerate of your partner's feelings. Telling him you just need to get out of the house to have some time alone is absolutely valid, my gf does it from time to time and I don't take it personally.\n\nBut making him feel guilty for working from home and/or taking a sick day, or immediately leaving the room whenever he walks in is just plain inconsiderate. I get that you don't feel like interacting with him, but healthy relationships require compromise. Even if it's as much as sticking around for a minute or two and then retreating to another area and telling your boyfriend nicely that you would like to be alone. Maybe consider having \"spaces\" of your own, like your offices. Don't you have an office if you work from home?\n\nBut occupying a common area and then reacting the way you do when he enters it isn't okay. He's right, it is his house too\u2014and he shouldn't feel like he's not welcome there. And I don't blame him for feeling that way. If I were him, I'd feel like I was walking on eggshells whenever I entered my own home, or that I was going to piss you off by entering a place you already were. \n\nI do think it's pretty unreasonable to expect someone to leave a place where you both live so *you* can have alone time. There are other ways of accomplishing this that are less abrasive. Are you sure you don't actually despise this guy? Living together is generally a characteristic of relationships. You might want to reevaluate whether you want to be dating this person, because this isn't a normal way to treat someone you ostensibly care about. So I'd say YTA.", "This is a communication issue", "YTA.  This is SO rude.  You keep trying to kick him out of his house and then when he didn\u2019t then you leave the room?  I can\u2019t imagine he\u2019ll stay with you much longer.  This is NOT how you deal with this.  If you need alone time, carve it out yourself, go for a walk, get a hotel room, etc.  But don\u2019t act like he\u2019s in the way simply for existing in his own house.", "YTA, I can\u2019t believe people are defending you. You are in a relationship with someone. Leaving the room every time they enter makes them feel like something is wrong. This is normal human psychology. If you need that much alone time that you can\u2019t even be in the same room with someone even if they aren\u2019t interacting with you, you need to live alone. It\u2019s not fair to the person you live with. Or you need to have your alone time in a space that isn\u2019t shared. \n\nFYI I am also a person that needs a lot of alone time and it has not been good for my relationships in the past. Most people who want a relationship with someone want to be around that person. They don\u2019t want to have the person get up and leave when they walk in the room.   \nAlso are you planning to have kids? You can say goodbye to alone time.", "NTA and this is ridiculous. This is a you problem. You need a more respectful man. You need a dedicated space. Basically you need a solution because this isn't working.\n\nI have no idea how many rooms you have, but if possible, one needs to be **a dedicated you space**. Close the door, he can't enter. \n\nAlso not sure what is available in your hometown but we have a shared work space. It is like going to Starbucks but with cubicles and no coffee. A cubicle can be rented by the month or the hour. \n\nI rented an office inside a yoga studio for one day a week it was $25 a day and worth every freaking penny. \n\nWe also have a college library which is free to enter and there are some silent remote spots that have wifi.\n\nGOOD LUCK!", "YTA doesn\u2019t sound like you two are compatible. It maybe better if you two lived separately.", "ESH. It really sounds like the two of you aren\u2019t very compatible. I am an extrovert and would be incredibly hurt if my husband left the room every time I entered it. What\u2019s the point of being with him if you don\u2019t like his company? Everyone is concentrating on him not respecting your need for alone time (and it sounds like you need A LOT of alone time) and he\u2019s not by the way, but what about his need for companionship? Why is that any less important? Neither of you is respecting what the other one needs but maybe it\u2019s just not possible to do that and still be happy. Might be time for marriage counseling to see if it\u2019s even salvageable.", "You\u2019re literally conditioning your BF to be insecure and suspicious. Passive aggression and implied intent is not good communication. You need to sit down with him and clearly communicate how and when you need time to yourself.

I respect your need for space but you live with him, in his place, and you're literally making him feel bad for being in his place. Moreover, he wants to be around you, and you're treating him like an asshole for simply wanting to be near you.\n\nYou guys should take a break, or get some counseling, because this relationship is doomed as it stands.", "YTA\n\nYou moved into you boyfriends house and then want alone space.\n\nThis doesn't really make sense.

Your partner clearly wants to spend time with you, why don't you want to spend time with him?\n\n>I don\u2019t ask him to leave the space or to stop making noise, I simply remove myself to continue my alone time.\n\nYou sound like you want a roommate, not a partner. You need to have a frank conversation with yourself and think about your priorities in life. Do you love your partner? If so, you need to make some effort to make him feel that you love him. Being introverted is not an excuse to have a one-sided relationship.", "ESH, but him more so than you. It sounds like a communication breakdown - you aren\u2019t communicating your needs clearly and he isn\u2019t understanding your need for space.

If I\u2019m in the living room and my husband comes in to watch TV, I don\u2019t take it as him invading my space, I take it as him wanting to be near me because he\u2019s gets to work from home and as an extrovert he needs company and we love spending time together. If I feel like staying I will, but otherwise, I\u2019ll get up and hang out in the bedroom. I guess the difference is my hubby doesn\u2019t complain or get mad at me as he understands our differences.\n\nEdit for grammar", "I agree with you on this.

I mean, even having a special \u201cleave me alone\u201d hat would potentially work.

He needs to understand that it's not a *him* thing, it's a *anyone* thing.

Which I do agree with to a degree but I do sometimes like my alone time.  Me and him have been together going on 4 years. We spend all weekend together and maybe a weeknight together every few weeks.  He's a mechanic so he doesn't have to deal with people, whereas I'm in customer service and sales.  He's said many times he admires my ability to interact with people.  He HATES  with a major passion making small talk and refuses to do it.  There's been times he's ask me not to come over on the weekend as he needs alone time. Which to him 90% of the time means he's out on the boat fishing lol. (Before anyone gets the idea he's off cheating and just using alone time to cover it up, I know he's not as he'll randomly send me a pic of the moonlight on the water, a catfish he'd caught or whatnot.)  Which I respect and leave him alone.  Or he may text me and tell me to not be bugging him when I get there, which I understand as I do talk and ramble on a lot.  So when I get there I'll normally give him a kiss and go play with the cats or find a spot to chill out and read or play on my phone.  Then when he's ready for interaction he'll either come find me and start communicating or text me asking questions or such letting me know he's finished his alone time.

It surely doesn't feel good to see someone you love (and who you may be trying to be physically close to, even if just within your eyesight) move away from you all the time. I totally understand your needs, because I have those needs too, but we can't ignore what may feel like significant disinterest from his perspective.\n\nHe doesn't have his usual outings (presumably with friends or at least with other humans present) anymore. His down-time is now whittled down to all the time you have together, which is all day, but you may be chasing the need to be totally alone when YOU have down time, which overlaps with his down time.

He could kick me out tomorrow if he wanted, I have no legal right to stay here.\n\nBut it was a bit of a slap in the face when he said that to me (and this was years ago, but it felt relevant to this situation). It was hurtful because he invited me to live in his house, and that makes it our \u201chome\u201d. And I told him that it was hurtful at the time and he hasn\u2019t said anything like that since.

When I am very drained and intentionally spending time quietly in my own space, which happens the same time after work each day, if he comes to the room and puts on a podcast or turns on the tv, I move upstairs.

He got mad when I shared my frustration about this. And of course, this was a long time ago, pre-Covid\u2014 I mentioned it for context. \n\nOur house is one big shared space so he does sometimes barge in. I don\u2019t have any room to myself.

Plus this is my house, I will be here when I want to be.\"\n\nI think it's unfair to say the OP didn't state just that. The partner chose to make it personal, and then lorded his ownership of the space over her as a means of control. Effectively saying \"You don't have the right to have that need met if I don't want you to, because I own this space.\"", "I don't think using the activities of homesteaders or hunter-gatherers to justify how one should behave in contemporary society is even remotely valid, do you?

Why is it normal for OP to be home all the time, but not normal for bf to do the same? Why should her bf be the one who has to go into an office or leave the house for no reason other than to give her space? Why can't she get more hobbies or rent an office to work out of, since she's the one that hates being home after all? It isn't fair to expect him to stay out of the house when she is home just as much. It's a glaring double standard.\n\nShe doesn't need to play with him all the time or have deep conversations constantly. She just needs to share a living space. But it is clear from the post that she is annoyed by his mere presence\u2014so much as him making a passing comment to her or entering the same room pisses her off. It doesn't seem like he's constantly asking her to play board games or something. Plus, they're both working a significant part of the week, so it's not like they're talking all day\u2014and it doesn't seem like he's talking to her when she's trying to work.\n\nPlenty of couples have happy relationships when they both work from home. My boss and her husband do. I work 100% remotely, and my partner is in grad school, so she is home 90% of the time.

Gas money, food, drinks, and entertainment aren't free. He's going to have to go out and spend money when he really just wants to relax at home.\n\nLeaving the room when he enters probably makes him feel really bad. You said you explained to him why, but it probably still makes him feel bad and awkward. You make it sound like the house is pretty small. There's only so much he can do to give you space.

Im such an introvert that even spending an evening with my best friend or my family is draining and im excited, relieved and happy to get home to myself afterwards to recharge. \n\nHowever, the last long term relationship i had lasted 7 years and it was a relationship that i never felt like i needed to literally escape my girlfriend. She was the only person i could spend days at a time with and not feel like i needed to escape to recharge. I still needed time to myself, but just a couple hours playing video games or reading in my office/game room was plenty.\n\nThing is, we both had our own hobbies and interests that were separate from each other, and things that we both enjoyed. I personally dont believe a adult can be happy, functional and mentally solid if they do not have leisure activities they dedicate time to to unwind and get enjoyment out of. If you life essentially is, work, recover from work and sleep, then thats just a sad existence, and ive seen that cause more than a few relationships to fail. I understand some people have limited time because they have to work extra to make ends meet, but if you dont, there isnt really any excuse. I personally read, play video games, wargame, shoot trap and game, archery, rock climbing, go cycling with my brother and his dog, to name a few. A 40 hour work week gives plenty of time to spend with a partner, and to do your own things. (And as an introvert nearly all of those things i can do with or without other people, which is critical for me) \n\nIf you both had your own things to do, this wouldnt be an issue.

It would suck to have the person you've been missing all day tell you they don't want to be around you.

I definitely need alone time like you and get overestimated when I can't chill by myself some days but I also would feel like crap if I sat at home all day and my partner came home and hid from me. Sounds like you two need to either rethink your relationship or rethink your occupations to meet in the middle.", "Someone has probably said this but, if not, can you afford to get a cheap office and work there so you can use it squeeze in quiet alone time?", "Live alone if you want space.", "YTA. I am sorry but I don\u2019t get other answers. If you are working alone in an office and he comes bother you, yes that\u2019s annoying and you wouldn\u2019t be an AH. But he is in the living room? It\u2019s a shared space. You seemed annoyed that he is home. It\u2019s his home. I would feel pretty unwelcome in my own home. If you need some alone time, figure it out yourself, make a plan. Go to the office, a park or whatever. Tell him I need next 5h alone. You can\u2019t get this mad at him for working from home. Where do you want him to go? Stay in the bedroom all day cause you want to be alone? What about him? Come on. I am an introvert who needs alone time and I do not understand this at all. You either need therapy or to live alone because it\u2019s not healthy to be annoyed at your partner for *being home*", "YTA and I say this as a hermit level introvert myself. Your BF is more then likely a physical touch love language type and within the limited time he gets to see you you're basically telling him his presence is at best an annoyance. There are definitely ways to compromise and get your alone time AND fill his love meter but the way you're going about it is extremely selfish in a very toxic and hurtful manner. \n\n*\"As far as I'm concerned, I have expressed my need to have space, and if he can\u2019t understand, that's on him\"*\n\nThis kind of attitude is very unhealthy for a relationship. Physical touch love language types need their partners presence as much as we introverts need our alone time. Even if you're deeply in love with him and loyal your actions to him are screaming you can't even stand to be around him anymore and already a foot out the door, if not already cheating. Actions like just getting up and leaving when he enters the room, lying about where you been and what you where doing out when he was concerned. It's most likely tearing him apart. Like asking him to leave the house is just not how to go about it. These things can compound quickly. If he went and confided in someone already stressed out thinking the worst and explained to anyone your actions and by your own words him not understanding your need for alone time would tell them you're 100% cheating. This is where his anger and frustration stems from. In his perspective the love of his life is pulling away from him and possibly already on her way out and there's nothing he can do.\n\nSo some things that you can change to both get your alone time and make sure the BF's love meter stays healthy, like most here said, is better communication. Not just a sit down and negotiation style compromise but a constant flowing communication. Like if he enters a room you where recharging and relaxing in do not just up and leave. Acknowledge him, give him a couple minutes , interact with him, give him some show of love hug/kiss w/e then explain you're needing your recharge time then if he still needs the room move on to somewhere else in the house and never stop doing this affection and explanation. Also if you're just going to chill in a parking lot or the garage just tell him shoot a text or let him know beforehand that you might so he's not worried. Also be aware that there will be times he may very much need your presence as much as you need to recharge on a bad day and guys are absolutely horrible at asking for help. So if he's being a bit clingy and you're on empty and he seems to be extra in your space flat out ask him he most likely is hurting and needs you. During these times you'll need to able to find activities you can both do in the same space that doesn't overstimulate you and he gets to be close. Like letting him nap in your lap while you read.", "Um...It's understandable you need space but the way you are expressing it is very cruel, and going to make your husband feel stonewalled and neglected. \n\n**I think it's** ***your*** **responsibility to take on LESS WORK so you have more time for both yourself and your marriage.** YTA for taking out your overwhelm with working too many hours on him. **You don't have enough space because you work too much. How is this his fault?** \n\nOn the other hand it seems he works a normal amount of time, and spends a lot of time home. He gets excited to see you and have some company...then you shut him down, put earplugs in and literally walk away like he is leper. This is going to be horrific for his self esteem. He also pays ore of the expenses than you do. He seems like a loving husband being bamboozled and gaslit by your asshole behaviour. Wake up and get some perspective on how you treat other people. **Stop blaming others for your own self neglect. It's not his fault that you work too much.** He's just there, and he is right - **it's also his house and you can't just shame him into leaving your space. Shame on you for making him feel unwelcome in his own home!**\n\nFind healthy ways to get some space that don't involve belittling your husband and making him feel like shit. Take some damn responsibility for yourself.", "NTA technically... needing alone time is reasonable. But if my partner was essentially avoiding me, I would feel weird about it too. \nMy husband works from home and I don't work so it's rare to be alone in the house. \nStill, we get plenty of alone time, for example he'll play games in the office, I'll read a book in the bedroom. If either of us enters the other space we don't flee... we might have a brief, positive interaction and return to our separate spaces. I probably wouldn't try to have alone time in a space that was too close to somewhere he might want to go, like the kitchen.  (I can't think of a reason he would come into the bedroom where I'm reading and disrupt me for any great length of time - if he wanted to have a nap I'd tuck him in and move myself.) \n\nI think that would be the main problem for me- having a negative interaction when encountering my spouse around the house. There's no right way to cohabitate, but for most people it involves some level of being able to tune out the other person and do your own thing even when they're ambiently around. \nIf you told him that you were going to be alone in the laundry room (or anywhere relatively private) for a few hours and to just wait until you came out, would he not give you that space? The way you describe it it does sort of sound like you start to have your alone time and then end up \"running away\" from him when he interrupts it- can you stop him from interrupting it?", "NTA, but you need to have more conversations about your needs. I'm the same way-I have six kids, so there's practically always noise. You reach your saturation point, and you either need time to decompress, or you're going to lose it. And it builds up over time, leading to resentment. I totally get car time. I know lots of people who do it, but you still need time at home too decompress.\n\nI wonder if there's another way to get the point to him. Make sure that he understands that you're not avoiding him, you're just taking space so you can be a better, more relaxed, partner. It's not about him, you don't want you be with ANYBODY for a bit. It lets your brain settle. If he still refuses to leave you alone sometimes, ask him how you can make your time together more meaningful, so he doesn't feel like you're rejecting him. I'm lucky that my husband gets it. Sometimes, I just go and fall asleep because I need to disconnect from all the noise, or I'll get super stressed and snappy. It behooves him to give you space.", "I don't get why everyone is saying the BF is TA here. For what reason? Living at home?

That is HIS home as well as yours, and as such you have zero right to request he leaves/spends less time there in order to get time alone. It's OK to need time alone, but it is YOUR responsibility to find a way to do that while respecting that your bf has the same right to use your shared home as you do. I live with my very, very loud family AND have severe misophonia. I cope by using noise cancelling headphones where I create soundscapes with ASMR/rain sounds and spending time in libraries/study spaces. I have 0 right to request people spend less time in the house to accommodate my daily need. Why does your need for being alone take precedence over your bfs need to relax in his own home? It's not like he's banging pots and pants at every hour of the day, he's just existing there. I personally don't feel it's rude to turn on tv/podcasts in the same room as someone else (again, just buy good headphones, and everyones happy) He must feel like he's not welcome in his own home by his own partner; no wonder he's aggravated. You need to find a COMPROMISE/solution TOGETHER.\n\nBuy some good headphones, find a good library, read a good book. Come up with a compromise where both people are happy.

And having personal space in your shared home is important not just to relax in, but to decorate in a way that reflects just you.  \n\nI think your partner claims a disproportional amount of space and energy for himself.  You\u2019re contributing to the mortgage but he referred to HIS house. Not \u201cour\u201d house. That personally would tell me where I fit into the equation.

But i honestly needed a lot of afirmation \"I love, and want you, I just need some alone time\". \"I love you and enjoy you, me needing alone time is not a reflection on my feelings for you, but of my needs\".\n\n\nBut we compromise both ways alot, sometimes he sacrefices that alone time for my sake, and sometimes I sacrifice my need for companionship for his sake. I hope you guys figure out OP.", "NTA but I\u2019d reevaluate if this relationship is going to work for the long run. \nI\u2019d also try to see if I could move out. \nIf he can\u2019t respect and understand the need for alone time and even throws it in your face that it\u2019s HIS house when you try to help yourself on it, that\u2019s a red red in the first place about it being HIS house, but the disrespect to not give you alone time is another big red flag.", "Nta. As someone who also needs time alone to recharge, I understand how important it is. It's a bit concerning that you and your partner live together and yet he still doesn't understand this about you. It makes me wonder if he is intentionally disregarding your needs. You're not asking to be alone for weeks at a time, by the sound of this post you're only asking for a few hours in one day. You are entitled to honour your needs in order to have a healthy mind", "NTA\n\nIt's perfectly normal for someone to want some alone time to recharge, especially if you're an introvert and you have to be so 'on' for work all the time. \n\nI think the only problem here is communication and a lack of understanding of each others needs. He doesn't understand that your need for alone time really is nothing against him. If anything, it's important for a healthy relationship. \n\nAlso, you can't decide to move in together and then he pulls the \"it's my house\" card. That would piss me off to the point of wanting to move out tbh. Either you are sharing a living space or you're not, it doesn't matter who had it first. He sounds quite childish to be honest. \n\nMaybe have a talk with him about attachment styles and about personality styles (e.g. how  common it is for introverts to need some alone time to decompress).", "NTA I almost started crying reading your post. Because I feel you, I know exactly what you mean. And your boyfriend doesn't respect your boundaries whatsoever. Is that the only situation in which he walks over you? Either way, your feelings are absolutely valid. Just because he isn't an introvert and doesn't understand the need for alone time doesn't mean you aren't entitled to your alone time, or he doesn't have to respect it. He has to start to respect your alone time. You already backed off so much. Otherwise, I fear you will go crazy over this... At least I would.", "NTA for need space and alone time; my wife is similar and I do my best to give her the silence and solitude she needs.\n\nHowever, if my wife left the room every time I entered the room I would probably feel really hurt.", "Nta, I am exactly the same way. I need time to myself. I love my boyfriend but I want to be able to do the dishes and sit around without anyone there.", "NTA but why are you being so slow to realise this guy is an asshole and has no respect for you or your comfort? You literally have to run away from him in the home you share just to get a minute to yourself despite being very clear about your needs. Grow a backbone and do yourself a kindness for God's sake and move out.", "NTA. You've told your BF you want time alone, and he won't listen or help facilitate. If he doesn't understand your needs and doesn't seem to want to try, I think you should consider whether you want to be with him at all or if indeed a traditional relationship in which you live with someone full-time is for you. (I say that as someone who is like you, was in a similar situation, and was married for 10 years but now living alone and honestly don't think I could go back to living FT with someone else.)", "NTA, but he needs to know clearly why you are leaving the room. I need alone time too. It often annoys me when I expected to have it and then my partner ends up changing his plan to be at home, but he lives here too so I deal. He also wants background noise all the time which drives me nuts as I like silence. When he comes into the room with noise coming from his phone, I get up and leave. It\u2019s not about not wanting to be in the room with him, it\u2019s about not wanting to listen to his noise, despite me buying him several types of headphones or earbuds.", "NTA. But I think you need too much alone time to be living with someone.", "Oh my. I relate to this so much. NTA. My husband is similar to your bf and has much shorter work hours than me so he's always around when I'm home. He also likes to chat whereas I like to unwind silently. All you can do is talk about it and compromise if you can, ands it doesn't seem like your bf is unwilling to compromise. My husband will play videigames or watch TV for a while after I get home to give me chance to unwind,  and I make sure we have time together like he wants ro chat. That works for us, but I'm not sure you can find a sustainable solution.", "NTA...", "I'm fairly introverted myself with a client facing job, I feel like if you can't like relax and recharge with you partner not actively disturbing you in the same room, you need to really examine why. I'm assuming you sleep together? Why is that like a 'chill/ignore eachother in the same space' time, but otherwise you want to leave the room?", "His \"this is MY house\" stuff is a big red flag.  Either they ate sharing a space, or OP is a lodger in HIS home.\n\nOP, which do you want it to be?  Because he seems very clear on which it is.\n\nAlso he doesn't understand introverts.\n\nNTA.", "what about living separately ?", "My fianc\u00e9 and I don\u2019t live together and when we do, we\u2019ll probably have our own rooms.

We both have our issues and trauma and we know and support each other. After dinner he always asks what I want and we\u2019ll either spend the evening gaming together, or he will leave to his room to play games alone, leaving me alone in the living room all evening. If I\u2019m not feeling well and I want to spend the whole weekend alone lying in the couch, I can. It\u2019s all about communication and being understanding.", "Exactly! Instead of asking what's wrong or how draining the day was for OP, he just made it about himself and tried using it as a ways to make an unnecessary argument that would futher stress OP out. My ex was the same thing and the funnier part is that he was staying at my house temporarily due fake family issues at his house. (I say fake as I found out during break up his whole family are narcissists too)\n\nI would want alone time and he took it personally and start an argument, then after getting me stressed and worked out even more he'd ignore me for days on end being petty about the alone time and only talk with me again after I apologized for even wanting time alone.\n\nThis will escalate to the worst as it'll turn from mental abuse to physical abuse anytime when he decides to resort to it. OP has got to find a way out because I highly doubt counseling could do anything but add more stress to OP and give him more ammunition.", "Except its NOT just HIS house, it stopped being his house when OP moved in. They are a partner, not a roommate. AND they pay monthly, so they have just as much right to the space, to use as they wish, as the bf.", "Honestly, reading OP's comments, it sounds more like bf just doesn't have anything going on in his life besides her and work, and as a result is basically relying on her for *all* his entertainment/social/emotional support needs. \n\nApparently he quit his hobbies (that required him to go outside the house) before covid and never went back. OP says that he essentially never leaves the house except for dates with her, family gatherings he attends with her, and errands where *she* needs an extra pair of hands.\n\nI feel like even an extrovert would be drained by this point. He sounds like the partner equivalent of one of those ultra-clingy cats who claws at the bathroom door whenever their human tries to pee alone. Dude needs to join a club or something.", "OP communicated their needs. The partner seemingly ignored them. So OP set their own boundaries and held to them. There\u2019s nothing wrong with OP but this might not be the right relationship for either of them.", "But then you're back to the question he already asked, which OP didn't answer: where is he supposed to go for an entire day? Like, just sit at the library? Then why doesn't she just go sit at the library? Why should he get thrown out of the house? Or just get sent to his room? Then why doesn't she go to her room all day? Whatever she wants to burden him with, she could do it herself.", "She\u2019s paying towards the mortgage.", "I agree you have it worked out, but OP's situation is vastly different. OP I understand the need for me time! But maybe leaving together isn't the best idea. He's WFH, so probably doesn't get alot of human interaction, which when your home he sees that as his chance to get that interaction. You work 60-70hrs a week! There really isn't much time for your relationship when you work alot, which would be another reason why your bf is trying to get as much time with you as possible. \n\nYour options are:\n\n1. Move out, so you get your me time and just see bf on the weekends \n\n2. Cut down your hours, so you get extra time to enjoy your bf and get me time. \n\n3. Keep arguing about me time.\n\n4. Bf gives you what you want, but that is something you can't control. \n\n5. Break up, because your no longer compatible.", "There are other problems here, but your partner desperately needs a hobby or two that get them out of the house sometimes. They need to have a life outside of you. Also might be worthwhile digging into why they've lost interest in hobbies that they used to have.", "That's why we have to be upfront about our needs from day 1. 'I can only meet up on Saturdays. I need to spend Sundays recharging alone. If this doesn't work for you, then we shouldn't date.'\n\nSimilar conversation happened when we discussed potentially moving in together. I can compromise on A B C but not X Y Z. \n\nThere are extroverts out there who can adjust to living with an introverted partner and vice versa.

Thank you!", "Same, I would be locking the bedroom door.", "That's just not how language is used. You know exactly what he meant and it wasn't \"flexing\" or saying she had to be accessible", "That need is completely normal and understandable. However it is also completely unacceptable to ask your bf to leave what is HIS home as well as yours.", "No, it IS HIS home, just as it is HER home too. They both have equal rights to be there as much/as little as they want.", "How about when someone you like *isn\u2019t* leaving the room, but they tell you directly, with words, that they need time alone, and that it isn\u2019t because you\u2019ve done anything wrong, it\u2019s just a need they have. But you keep being in their space, so they start (once or twice a week) specifically hanging out in another room than the one you\u2019re currently in, to get some space, and then when you\u2019re going into \u201ctheir\u201d space and putting on a podcast they quietly move to another space, to have the alone time they\u2019ve been asking you to give them?", "Hell, my wife is a huge extrovert, and she still sometimes requires time to herself with an audiobook or Netflix series or something. Everyone needs it sometimes!", "When he asked where he was supposed to go? I didn't take it as dismissing it outright. I took it as literally asking where he was supposed to go. And OP couldn't answer, because there's nowhere he can go. OP new it wasn't do-able, so she had no answer.", "I completely agree. I am an extrovert, and I have a five year old son who is too. My husband, however, is an introvert. I know he needs quiet and his own space but we live in a small apartment so he can't get physical space. My son and I give him \"mental space\". Everybody has headphones on and the little one knows papa can't talk now. I listen to podcasts, little one watches YouTube kids and hubby also has headphones but sometimes listens to nothing. Meditation also helps with his introvert needs. We have been together for 10 years and this setup works for us. Even a five year old can be taught with time and patience that his father has different needs sometimes.", "OP is already working outside the house 60-70 hours/week. Is it so much to ask for some at home alone time??", "I don't get why you were downvoted. You suggested a sensible course of action in getting therapy. A therapist is impartial mediator for both their needs.", "She has, but now instead of either continuing to express that need or deciding that they're not compatible, she's basically ignoring the issue by leaving the room without saying anything. That's not healthy for a relationship in a similar way that being enmeshed isn't healthy. I'm not saying she should stay with him and take not having any alone time, I'm saying that this is just delaying the issue rather than actually solving it.   \n   \nEdit to add: and in terms of \"more communication\", I'm not talking about saying \"I need more alone time\", I'm talking about going to couple's therapy or otherwise making it explicitly clear that this is a requirement for the relationship to continue (I hesitate to bring up ultimatums because those aren't the healthiest either, but OP may be at that point).", "I meant for him to go out and visit people", "This is the answer.", "Yeah, this is it. \n\nHere's a suggestion. Why not allocate a specific time as his time. So like every evening for 30 minutes you guys go for a walk in the neighborhood and talk. Or every weekend go to a movie or a park or a good restaurant or some fun activity. That way it'll show that he's being catered too. And you will also know that you have to be available then. You can also set 1 hour everyday aside for your me time and let him know of the time so that you aren't randomly at any point of the day or week just walking away from him for a me time. \n\nI think doing one activity with him and doing one separately and telling him that you wanna use that as me time would probably communicate better.", "I also wonder if his needs are being met in the relationship. This may just be a compatibility issue. Given that she works 60-70 hours out of the house every week, spends hours out running errands and taking extra time to sit in her car, and then needs to be alone at home for several hours every week, how much actual quality time are they spending together? If he\u2019s an extrovert and she\u2019s always gone or unavailable, he\u2019s probably really craving some greater intimacy and companionship in the relationship that she doesn\u2019t seem to have the time or bandwidth to offer. It might explain why he hangs so close sometimes when she\u2019s trying to be alone. Better communication and compromise are needed here, as they *both* have needs that matter and deserve to be met.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d go crazy if my partner never left the house and never gave me any time alone. But I\u2019d also really struggle with a partner who works and runs errands for that many hours and then needs so much alone time that they\u2019re seldom available to me or have the energy and desire to interact. Both sound like a huge bummer, to put it bluntly, and neither seems like a healthy extreme. They are at polar-opposite odds with one another.", "Same here. Five roommates and it's hell sometimes. I don't think my partner understands that for me, when there's that many humans in a room, often it's just *too much*. There's too much going on, especially when I've been drained by my - very socially demanding - job every single day that week, and I just want to run away to my room and be left alone. \n\nAnd if I don't get my alone time, I just get angrier and angrier, and it gets harder and harder for me to behave like a normal, rational person, *until* I get alone time. I have no control over it, it just happens.", "It happens frequently on posts like this. The op will write at length about the various ways they've directly and unambiguously communicated their needs, only to be ignored or dismissed...and then the thread fills up with people saying \"you just need to communicate better\" b/c they either didn't read the whole post or don't understand that communication is a two-way street and it doesn't matter how direct you are with someone who refuses to listen.\n\n> And it feels like the bf almost intentionally misunderstands what OP is communicating.\n\nYuuuuup. This post is exactly how my ex's clinical narcissism began to manifest in our relationship...a complete refusal to allow me \"alone\" time, and then getting butt-hurt and taking it personally when I insisted. If we were in the same building and my attention wasn't on him, he took it as a personal slight. Notice how op says she's feeling so worn down from the situation? I'm betting that's exactly what the bf wants.", "And then he added in the, well its MY house. Fine, your name is on the mortgage, but OP is paying for it too...so they should have the right to some damn down time alone!", "It seems more to me like she told him to leave the house more, and I could definitely see someone thinking that was about them\u2026", "But when she retreats into another room he follows her, so what exactly is she supposed to do? \n\n- She planned her day off to match with a day where he was out working, but he started working from home on those specific days, and now he\u2019s fully wfh. So that\u2019s out.\n\n- She runs errands to have some time alone, and hides out in her car, but he comments on that and she needs to come up with an explanation. It isn\u2019t really all that nice hiding in your car in a random parking place either. So that\u2019s probably out.\n\n- She quietly retreats to a different room to have some time alone, and he follows her. So that doesn\u2019t work.\n\n- She\u2019s tried explicitly asking for alone time, assuring him that it isn\u2019t because he\u2019s doing anything wrong, and he\u2019s taking it as him doing something wrong. So that hasn\u2019t worked.\n\nSo please enlighten us all, what should she do - if leaving isn\u2019t an option, because she happens to like the guy?\n\nShe pays 45% of all expenses for the household (including the mortgage of course), so how fair is it, exactly, that *she* can\u2019t be in her home?", "Speaking as an introvert, society really isn't built for us. There's this weird expectation that if you love someone, that means you should want to be around them *all the time* \\- and that if you don't, there is something wrong with the relationship. Just from my experience, there is an *intense* pressure that you should want to be social all the time. \n\nThe kind of comments OP's getting aren't surprising to me.
