I am not overly muscular, do not see the appeal of 'sleeve' tattoos, and having not given much thought to what else might be popular examples, and do not know what I might choose if 'my life depended on it', as the saying goes.\n\nHowever, I would consider it, discuss it, invite suggestions, and offer my concerns. I wouldn't decline, and defend my position so urgently, if in the situation you've presented - someone I love invited me to consider it. Your wife's appreciation of tattoos (having made a very distinct declaration of love) influences her motive. Being sensitive to that, I would want to respond in such a way that did not undermine the gesture.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinding an alternative gesture is not the first consideration.
