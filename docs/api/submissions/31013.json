Who knows, maybe granddad can learn a thing or two over time.", "NTA - you were combatting some toxic masculinity, good job. Love this for you.", "NTA. Is he doesn\u2019t want to be embarrassed, he shouldn\u2019t do embarrassing things.", "NTA - You were just standing up for your son and setting the record straight. No need to apologize for that.", "NTA you didn't embarrass him, he did it by himself. Maybe get him a calendar, it's 2023 and that sh*t is not okay anymore.", "Jesus Christ NTA at all. FIL embarrassed himself and can deal on his own, you and your husband both handled that perfectly. Do not coddle grown ass men who think that expressing love is a female weakness.", "NTA-  love you r/rattyhandwritting", "NTA\n\nThe older generation is generally like that, men don't say it.  \nI don't remember my grandfathers ever saying \"I love you\" to me and I never felt the need to because it was obvious. Same with my father and my uncles.\n\nBut younger people tend to express it more, so when the question was asked, your answer was correct.", "The more I think about it the more pissed off I\u2019m getting. My youngest is so sweet and affectionate and caring, how dare someone - ANYONE - try and squash that out of him?!", "Thanks - love you too", "I'd say it's case by case, my 76 year old dad (and I would qualify someone born in the 40s as fitting this category) has always told me he loved me. Grew up in a smallish city in WV too so the culture of uncaring male figures was definitely around.", "My father is a Vietnam Vet, year round sportsman, dually truck driving, 80 year old wild man. We have DEFINITELY had many less than stellar moments, but he makes a point to says \"I love you\" when we see each other or talk on the phone. Play the song \"The Living Years\" for him. NTA", "It\u2019s really bizarre to me because his parents are actually nearly 20 years younger than mine, and it definitely wasn\u2019t a thing for my dad. Still isn\u2019t for that matter. I never knew my grandparents on either side but my Dad says he remembers his Dad hugging him every day right up until he died when my Dad was 16.", "Exactly.", "And his own grandfather, no less. That's just so sad and pathetic.", "Maybe it depend on their history...\n\nThe two sides of my familly are made of farmers/breeders. I was a harsh life in the 50s, they had others priorities than pampering.", "That\u2019s a fair point. The in-laws are from a rural background in the south whereas my family are from a large city in the north. My grandad was a policeman, husband\u2019s was a farmer.
