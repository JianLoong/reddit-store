You're teaching him the right things. If it went unsaid then despite how small or insignificant the moment was in your son's eyes it would have eventually add up and left an impression on him.

We all do, because my mom lost her dad at age 9 to a car accident, and she taught us that you never know when the last time you get to tell someone you love them will happen.

Good for you.", "Omg, NTA! \n\nLet me tell you this:\n\nBoth of my parents are older. My dad will be 70 soon, my mom is in her 60s. They are both immigrants and come from generations where you don't explicitly express your love. When my mother had children, she made it a point to always say \"I love you\", hug us, kiss us, etc. from the time we were infants, because she wanted to LEARN how to express her love. My dad, who is still learning, has made huge progress and has recently been saying \"I love you\" first.\n\nIf someone truly loves you, they will learn how to express it in ways they understand. Grandad has a lot of learning to do, and he clearly embarrassed himself by making love out to be some 'feminine/weak' thing. You and your hubby made the perfect move as parents!! Keep nurturing your child's emotions, because it's so important!\n\nGood job, parents!", "It\u2019s not a generational thing, it\u2019s a some men thing. My husband has an uncle in his 80s who says I love you to all the people in his life he loves, regardless of age or gender. My father verbally expressed his love for all of his adult children and his grandkids all the time before he died last year. My husband, age 70,  tells his grown nephews he loves them every time they talk, and they tell him the same.", "NTA fanatstic parenting from you both! Really, you guys were quick on your feet in that situation and I think that it's great that your nephew said ily back. It shows that even after having lived with the grandpa in his life longer than your son it's not affected him being open with his feelings. Which I'm sure you guys can claim some credit to :)", "Heh.\n\nMy father is also from a generation where, past a certain age, men did not hug their sons, or tell them that they love them.\n\nI had to retrain him. \n\nHe certainly says it now.

You and your husband handled that perfectly.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyour sister in law is an AH, you handled that VERY well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu have NOTHING to apologize for.", "NTA fil tried to impose a foolish and harmful belief, and you rightfully quashed that on the spot. Both your son and fil got a useful lesson, hopefully. If fil doubles down, challenge him again, more directly, about why he thinks he is correct. It's a very harmful stereotype he's trying to enforce, but you already know that. I'm glad your kid has parents with great beliefs and skills!", "It makes me so happy to read they way everyone else reacted. You've built something good here, I'm so glad FIL was the exception and not the rule.", "NTA- thank you for stopping the toxic masculinity for your son.", "NTA. Tough beans for gramps.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nIt's our job as parents to show our children that it's OK to love and show emotion regardless of their gender. It's like my step-dad telling me off for buying my 2yo (now 13yo) son his own baby doll and pram so he would leave his big sisters (then 4yo) alone (was her 1 toy no one was allowed to touch or she'd lose it), and buying her, her own toy dump truck. Or my Step dad's family telling my son (7 at the time) boys don't cry, or that they need to be respectful and accept hugs from grandparents/uncles/aunts etc when they don't want to. Like emotions only exist in half the population and that body autonomy isn't important. Kids learn what we teach them, they learn from the examples they see around them. I LOVE that your husband and nephew are secure enough in themselves that they helped set the example. \n\nThe only thing I would add, to the above comment to talk with your FIL, is to also talk to your son. My exhusband told our (then 3yo) daughter off for not saying I love you back to him when he said it. This can set a bad precedent because teaching kids they have to say it back, can lead to dangerous situations as they age. For example, I work as a case manager with families who are experiencing a range of issues; I worked with a family of a young girl of 12 who said she loved her older brothers friend (17) back after he said it to her, and he then raped her, telling her if she really loved him she would let him and tried to manipulate her to keep quiet - obviously worst case type scenario but it happens. \n\nTeaching children that it is OK for others not to say it back is OK, just like it is ok for them not to say it back if they aren't comfortable. You could talk about the different ways his grandfather shows he cares, while explaining that some people are not comfortable saying it (as you did by saying g he only says it to his wife).", "NTA Don\u2019t know if your FIL is misogynistic or homophobic, but he\u2019s certainly just plain ick.  Tell your husband about SIL and let him handle his family.", "when both my grandfathers were alive they would go over and BEYOND just saying i love you, to show how much they loved their grandkids. That guys just a loser and a dick apparently.", "nta- everyone is entitled to their own opinion with it.", "My dad has many faults but he has never once held back from telling me how much he loves me and he's 61. You are NTA and keep spreading love every place you can. You are a great parent!", "Toxic masculinity.\n\nNTA. I think your way of handling it was charming and kind! You couldn't have been nicer about the whole thing. Was Gramps embarrassed to be called out for his views? Probably.\n\nHonestly, life's short. Having more people love you is a worthy goal and not leaving them wondering by using your words is generally appreciated as we cannot read minds.", "NTA\n\nFuck that toxic masculinity boomer shit..\n\nHow masculine is it to be afraid of saying 3 words to someone.. Yeah, that's real alpha shit.", "NTA, but I have to say, your life sounds a bit like a reboot of \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond\u201d", "NTA my grandfather is pushing 90 and still says ILY to all his kids, grandkids, and great grandkids. He says it every time because his father never said it to him... ever. So he makes sure we know Every. Single. Time. \n\nAgain... NTA", "NTA at all!\nBut y'all in the comments need to calm down on grandpa. Believe it or not, child neglect, isolation, and abuse happened *in the past too*, not just to your generation, and these things are hard to shake. Granddad is acting out of his life experience. Obviously some other people in his generation grew up with open and affectionate family, but it was definitely more common for guys in decades past to restrict affectionate talk, and it's possible that this social boundary is normal to him because that's what he grew up with.\n\nStill, he should be more aware of how your family works since he's literally next door... And your H did nothing wrong in directly challenging him. Grandpa may have been embarrassed at being called out, but he shouldn't have been bent about it. Hopefully he'll soften his thinking due to this.", "Yep, YTA. Not the time and place.  He told you,  without telling you,  that he comes from a place where his ability to verbally express such things is stunted, so you,  from your place of greater ability to verbally express your emotions choose to humiliate him?!? Take your child home and explain this to him, and keep him emotionally open.  Humiliating the guy who was emotionally abused as a child was the wrong way to go. Really,  it took you all these years to notice this about your FIL? Surely,  you aren't THAT  lacking in observation.  People like that say , \"I love you.\", by the things that they do for you or the other things they say, like \"Have a good day at school. \". I shudder to think about how that got drilled into him when he was a kid.", "YTA, I agree with your sister in law. I think your grandfather was attempting to instill practical or moral values in your son. You may disagree with them, you may have a conversation with him to say it's not wanted, you can explain it to your son, etc. But it's overall harmless if it's under your supervision and you can overrule it. So yes I think you went a little too far. In case it's not obvious, I happen to agree with him that 11 is getting to be a little old for children to saying \"I love you\" to family on every interaction. They should be graduating to other ways of showing respect and affection.", "NTA. I would tell FIL straight up that until he works on his misogynistic and/or homophobic views, and then sincerely apologizes for his idiotic, harmful behavior, he will not be allowed any contact with his grandson.", "NTA. FIL shouldn\u2019t be trying to pass his weird emotional hang ups to your son.", "NTA. Nor is your father-in-law.\n\n  \nMaybe it's his age, maybe it is just how he was raised. But you were totally correct in jumping to thwart his attempt to teach your child differently, that \"real\" men don't say that. He was the one confronting your parenting style, not the other way around.   \n\n\nOh, and I like that your husband jumping into the discussion without missing a beat. You got a keeper.", "NTA but shout out to the 16 year old nephew for the back up", "Sounds like my grandparents to be honest. I once said \u201cI love you\u201d to my baby cousin. They laughed as if it was ridiculous of me to have a familial attachment to him. Are you British by any chance? \ud83d\ude02 NTA regardless of where you\u2019re from!", "My 92 year old grandfather says \u201cI love you\u201d to me every time I see him. He taught me to say it so often. My dad texts randomly to say \u201clove you\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s not a generation thing, is a misogyny thing.", "I don't know - my da is nearly 80, and tells me he loves me at least once a day.", "It must depend on where you live and the family's culture.  Males in my family and my husband's say \"I love you\" routinely.  Like, you're going to stop saying \"I love you\" to Grandma at puberty?  As if.  But anyway, my parents were born in the 1930s, and my dad absolutely said \"I love you\" to all family, as did my father-in-law, roughly the same age.", "Thank you for this.
