You're teaching him the right things. If it went unsaid then despite how small or insignificant the moment was in your son's eyes it would have eventually add up and left an impression on him.

We all do, because my mom lost her dad at age 9 to a car accident, and she taught us that you never know when the last time you get to tell someone you love them will happen.

Good for you.", "Omg, NTA! \n\nLet me tell you this:\n\nBoth of my parents are older. My dad will be 70 soon, my mom is in her 60s. They are both immigrants and come from generations where you don't explicitly express your love. When my mother had children, she made it a point to always say \"I love you\", hug us, kiss us, etc. from the time we were infants, because she wanted to LEARN how to express her love. My dad, who is still learning, has made huge progress and has recently been saying \"I love you\" first.\n\nIf someone truly loves you, they will learn how to express it in ways they understand. Grandad has a lot of learning to do, and he clearly embarrassed himself by making love out to be some 'feminine/weak' thing. You and your hubby made the perfect move as parents!! Keep nurturing your child's emotions, because it's so important!\n\nGood job, parents!", "It\u2019s not a generational thing, it\u2019s a some men thing. My husband has an uncle in his 80s who says I love you to all the people in his life he loves, regardless of age or gender. My father verbally expressed his love for all of his adult children and his grandkids all the time before he died last year. My husband, age 70,  tells his grown nephews he loves them every time they talk, and they tell him the same.", "NTA fanatstic parenting from you both! Really, you guys were quick on your feet in that situation and I think that it's great that your nephew said ily back. It shows that even after having lived with the grandpa in his life longer than your son it's not affected him being open with his feelings. Which I'm sure you guys can claim some credit to :)", "Heh.\n\nMy father is also from a generation where, past a certain age, men did not hug their sons, or tell them that they love them.\n\nI had to retrain him. \n\nHe certainly says it now.

Your kid needed you and you did the right thing.  NTA", "NTA. In the last couple of years,  I've lost a handful of friends to accidents.

You and your husband handled that perfectly.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nyour sister in law is an AH, you handled that VERY well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu have NOTHING to apologize for.", "NTA fil tried to impose a foolish and harmful belief, and you rightfully quashed that on the spot. Both your son and fil got a useful lesson, hopefully. If fil doubles down, challenge him again, more directly, about why he thinks he is correct. It's a very harmful stereotype he's trying to enforce, but you already know that. I'm glad your kid has parents with great beliefs and skills!", "It makes me so happy to read they way everyone else reacted. You've built something good here, I'm so glad FIL was the exception and not the rule.", "NTA- thank you for stopping the toxic masculinity for your son.", "NTA. Tough beans for gramps.", "Definitely NTA. \n\nIt's our job as parents to show our children that it's OK to love and show emotion regardless of their gender. It's like my step-dad telling me off for buying my 2yo (now 13yo) son his own baby doll and pram so he would leave his big sisters (then 4yo) alone (was her 1 toy no one was allowed to touch or she'd lose it), and buying her, her own toy dump truck. Or my Step dad's family telling my son (7 at the time) boys don't cry, or that they need to be respectful and accept hugs from grandparents/uncles/aunts etc when they don't want to. Like emotions only exist in half the population and that body autonomy isn't important. Kids learn what we teach them, they learn from the examples they see around them. I LOVE that your husband and nephew are secure enough in themselves that they helped set the example. \n\nThe only thing I would add, to the above comment to talk with your FIL, is to also talk to your son. My exhusband told our (then 3yo) daughter off for not saying I love you back to him when he said it. This can set a bad precedent because teaching kids they have to say it back, can lead to dangerous situations as they age. For example, I work as a case manager with families who are experiencing a range of issues; I worked with a family of a young girl of 12 who said she loved her older brothers friend (17) back after he said it to her, and he then raped her, telling her if she really loved him she would let him and tried to manipulate her to keep quiet - obviously worst case type scenario but it happens. \n\nTeaching children that it is OK for others not to say it back is OK, just like it is ok for them not to say it back if they aren't comfortable. You could talk about the different ways his grandfather shows he cares, while explaining that some people are not comfortable saying it (as you did by saying g he only says it to his wife).", "NTA Don\u2019t know if your FIL is misogynistic or homophobic, but he\u2019s certainly just plain ick.  Tell your husband about SIL and let him handle his family.", "when both my grandfathers were alive they would go over and BEYOND just saying i love you, to show how much they loved their grandkids. That guys just a loser and a dick apparently.", "nta- everyone is entitled to their own opinion with it.", "My dad has many faults but he has never once held back from telling me how much he loves me and he's 61. You are NTA and keep spreading love every place you can. You are a great parent!", "Toxic masculinity.\n\nNTA. I think your way of handling it was charming and kind! You couldn't have been nicer about the whole thing. Was Gramps embarrassed to be called out for his views? Probably.\n\nHonestly, life's short. Having more people love you is a worthy goal and not leaving them wondering by using your words is generally appreciated as we cannot read minds.", "NTA\n\nFuck that toxic masculinity boomer shit..\n\nHow masculine is it to be afraid of saying 3 words to someone.. Yeah, that's real alpha shit.", "NTA, but I have to say, your life sounds a bit like a reboot of \u201cEverybody Loves Raymond\u201d", "NTA my grandfather is pushing 90 and still says ILY to all his kids, grandkids, and great grandkids. He says it every time because his father never said it to him... ever. So he makes sure we know Every. Single. Time. \n\nAgain... NTA", "NTA at all!\nBut y'all in the comments need to calm down on grandpa. Believe it or not, child neglect, isolation, and abuse happened *in the past too*, not just to your generation, and these things are hard to shake. Granddad is acting out of his life experience. Obviously some other people in his generation grew up with open and affectionate family, but it was definitely more common for guys in decades past to restrict affectionate talk, and it's possible that this social boundary is normal to him because that's what he grew up with.\n\nStill, he should be more aware of how your family works since he's literally next door... And your H did nothing wrong in directly challenging him. Grandpa may have been embarrassed at being called out, but he shouldn't have been bent about it. Hopefully he'll soften his thinking due to this.", "Yep, YTA. Not the time and place.  He told you,  without telling you,  that he comes from a place where his ability to verbally express such things is stunted, so you,  from your place of greater ability to verbally express your emotions choose to humiliate him?!? Take your child home and explain this to him, and keep him emotionally open.  Humiliating the guy who was emotionally abused as a child was the wrong way to go. Really,  it took you all these years to notice this about your FIL? Surely,  you aren't THAT  lacking in observation.  People like that say , \"I love you.\", by the things that they do for you or the other things they say, like \"Have a good day at school. \". I shudder to think about how that got drilled into him when he was a kid.", "YTA, I agree with your sister in law. I think your grandfather was attempting to instill practical or moral values in your son. You may disagree with them, you may have a conversation with him to say it's not wanted, you can explain it to your son, etc. But it's overall harmless if it's under your supervision and you can overrule it. So yes I think you went a little too far. In case it's not obvious, I happen to agree with him that 11 is getting to be a little old for children to saying \"I love you\" to family on every interaction. They should be graduating to other ways of showing respect and affection.", "NTA. I would tell FIL straight up that until he works on his misogynistic and/or homophobic views, and then sincerely apologizes for his idiotic, harmful behavior, he will not be allowed any contact with his grandson.", "NTA. FIL shouldn\u2019t be trying to pass his weird emotional hang ups to your son.", "NTA. Nor is your father-in-law.\n\n  \nMaybe it's his age, maybe it is just how he was raised. But you were totally correct in jumping to thwart his attempt to teach your child differently, that \"real\" men don't say that. He was the one confronting your parenting style, not the other way around.   \n\n\nOh, and I like that your husband jumping into the discussion without missing a beat. You got a keeper.", "NTA but shout out to the 16 year old nephew for the back up", "Sounds like my grandparents to be honest. I once said \u201cI love you\u201d to my baby cousin. They laughed as if it was ridiculous of me to have a familial attachment to him. Are you British by any chance? \ud83d\ude02 NTA regardless of where you\u2019re from!", "My 92 year old grandfather says \u201cI love you\u201d to me every time I see him. He taught me to say it so often. My dad texts randomly to say \u201clove you\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s not a generation thing, is a misogyny thing.", "I don't know - my da is nearly 80, and tells me he loves me at least once a day.", "It must depend on where you live and the family's culture.  Males in my family and my husband's say \"I love you\" routinely.  Like, you're going to stop saying \"I love you\" to Grandma at puberty?  As if.  But anyway, my parents were born in the 1930s, and my dad absolutely said \"I love you\" to all family, as did my father-in-law, roughly the same age.", "Thank you for this.

Letting kid know that some people save it up for the important moments, not the casual.", "NTA, it is totally fine to say 'love you', your FIL and SIL seem a bit stern and severe.", "Nta - this is sad! My kids always tell their grandparents they love them and it is reciprocated as it should be!", "I\u2019m 54 and my father (73M) say I love you to each other along with my 9 year old son every time we talk. NTA.", "He\u2019s wrong but you may not be able to change that. My Dad showed us love but it was not something he would say. It sucked but I also came to realize it was his problem and had nothing to do with me. Explain it to your son, that grandpa has a problem that has nothing to do with how awesome your son is. If he wants to continue saying I love you go for it and expect no response because grandpa has expression issues. If he is not happy without an appropriate response, he is welcome to stop communicating love to grandpa. Your SIL is ridiculous", "R means subreddit. You need to use \"u/\" for a username. \n\nr/ will take you to a subreddit by that name, while u/ will both ping the user, and create a link to their profile", "My dad said and says it all the time.  My grandfather preferred to say it with action.  I think it's partly a generational thing.", "Sounds like your dad is healthy about it.  He does things his way but can accept verbal affection.  I'm guessing he does a lot to demonstrate love?\n\nThere's a large school of older men who believe in \"show don't tell\" and would rather demonstrate affecction (hug, hand on the shoulder, gift, time spent together) rather than say the words.  I have a grandpa that was like that.  Beautiful man.  As for me I was taught by both my parents to verbalize affection but I'm still uncomfortable saying \"love you\" outside my family.  Just how I'm wired.  I guess I'm \"show don't tell\" outside my family too.", "My grandparents preferred to show love rather than express it.

You CAN teach an old dog new tricks sometimes.", "One of the last things I got to say to my brother before he passed away.  I'm 45.  My dad was the one who broke the cycle in our family and insisted to say I love you.  He was raised in the Midwest to people of Swedish stock so the odds were not in his favor but he overcame that.\n\nAlthough I'm still self conscious saying it to people who aren't members of the family.  I think a certain reticence is a bit genetic maybe?", "There's a place for taciturn people who would rather express love by actions rather than words.  The fact that his son is well adjusted means he's probably done a  pretty good job with what he had to work with, so people don't need ti be slagging the FIL for a bit of old social baggage he was burdened with as a boy.  He's clearly doing his best here.", "I do have some sympathy for those who can't/won't speak their love, but still act their love.  That was considered to be The Way when some of these older people were young.  \"Show, don't tell\" if you will.  \n\nSpending time together, doing little kind things for each other, being there when needed, showing touch based affection, that kind of thing.  For some people that just comes easier.  I agree that it's not a generational thing, there's simply more than one love language in the world.", "The man is free not to say he loves but he was out of line to push his backwards values on the kid.

Some people need to hear it but the really important thing is did he know his dad loved him.", "Yeah, he says he never had any doubt that his parents adored him.  And I have no doubts at all that FIL loves both my boys (although he\u2019s completely bewildered by my quiet, book-loving, football-hating eldest). \n\nWe\u2019ve had a really interesting conversation tonight, I\u2019ve just stepped away to let the two of them hash it out a bit further. Upshot is FIL is not angry, he was embarrassed, but mostly it\u2019s at himself. It\u2019s a bit emotional here at the mo.", "You lucky bugger, I\u2019m jealous! My dad is Scottish but his parents moved to Manchester in the 40s when he was about 3.", ">I\u2019m not convinced it\u2019s a generational thing either. It\u2019s just so unbelievably weird to me.\n\nI dont either, I think its how they were raised. My parents never said I love you, at 21, when I graduated from college, why they couldn't just say I'm proud of you and I love you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt that point it hit my mother, She told dad that when the grandbabies came he had better get over it and start telling them and his kids that he loves them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI had doubts growing up that I was loved but my 3 girls knew that my parents loved them very much. Abd before they died I knew I they loved me too.", "My grandpa was born in 1920, he passed away when I was 6. I adored him with every ounce of my tiny being for as long as I can remember. \n\nMy dad grew up in a small fishing village in Nova Scotia, Canada. He told me years ago one thing about grandpa that was seared into the mind of him and his siblings was the fact that grandpa never once said \"I love you\" to any of them. His way of expressing his feelings was to show them, protecting them, helping them with things (i.e. fixing their cars) that sort of thing.\n\nYears later, in the States, my dad and his oldest brother were the only two siblings who lived close to their dad. My uncle lived next door and we were 7 miles away, so we were at grandpa's a lot.\n\nFor years, grandpa was surrounded by his second wife's grandkids (she *was* the evil stepmother btw who wanted to erase his first family, even though they were adults).\n\nAnyway, along comes me. His youngest son's only child. His other children all had kids much older, had settled down far sooner than my dad, and lived on the other side of the country or back in Canada. I was a surprise, my uncle who lived next door didn't have kids and was more of a free spirit. I loved my grandpa from the moment I could crawl up his leg and attach myself to his chest and chatter away.\n\nDad says I was about 2 when I put my little hands on his face, looked in his blue eyes, and said, \"Grandpa, I love you.\" \n\nDad said he sputtered and got gruff and demanded to know who told me to say that, I told him no one, I just did. Dad said he just stared at me for the longest time. No one was paying attention, the house was always chaos, but dad said they fell dead silent when Grandpa said, \"I love you too, Rooster.\"\n\nMy dad cried.\n\nI was the only one grandpa ever said that too, the only child, and the only grandchild, not even his second wife, to ever hear those words, and he told me every day I saw him until he got sick and died.\n\nI don't know why my grandpa told me he loved me. My cousins knew he loved them, he did special things for them, went on special trips with them, but those words never left his mouth with them.\n\nHe was a strong man, old world. Some of his generation felt that words were meaningless, anyone can say words, but true love was shown in your actions, what you did. Misguided? Yes. Grandpa seemed to realize he could *show* and *tell* me he loved me.\n\nMaybe it was because I was the youngest, maybe there was something else about me that triggered Grandpa to be able to say the words he never said to the others.\n\nThe point of this rambling story, though, is thst even my grandpa learned to say the words \"I love you...\"\n\nAnd mean them.", "This. My FIL told my partner when he was 6-7 that he was now too old for kisses from dad. My partner remembers how sad that made him so now when we have kids he is very excited to be able to break that bullshit-cycle into a million pieces.", "That sounds like the best dad mmm pancakes", "My dad at 82 will still throw out his arm at a quick stop in the car to keep me (49F) from going into the dash.....the kicker is I am the one driving the car.  \n\nNow my Great-Grandmother, who died at 98 in 1989, proudly told me and my cousins she has never kissed a man on the mouth.

I don\u2019t mind if they don\u2019t say it back, but most of them do now. I\u2019ve never told them why I do it.\nBoys & men should always be encouraged to express their feelings in a healthy way.

You should remind him that he's a grandfather, and acting like a little butthurt child is very unbecoming.", "> Now my sister in law says we shouldn\u2019t have embarrassed him like that and we need to apologise. \n\nYou tell your SIL that if he wants an apology so badly he should act like a grownup and ask for one himself.\n\nNTA.

If you decide to give him one be *very careful* you stick to apologizing for hurting his feelings while being clear that what he said was wrong and you don't want your son to hear it again.)", "NTA - But why are you living cheek and jowl with your family? Is it some kind of cultural thing?", "NTA.\n\nYou're not an AH for this, you were making sure your kid learned it's ok to say \"I love you\" to people and not some old-timey \"Men don't say that!\" BS.  It's a question of how you talk to your FIL next.\n\nMy recommendation, when you do talk to him, is let him know that you understand he doesn't say it to anyone but his wife and that's OK, you have no issues with that.  However you don't want your son thinking it's not OK if he wants to say it to others, and so you weren't trying to embarrass him and are sorry if you unintentionally did.  I say this because I don't think you actually wanted to embarrass your FIL, just not have the wrong lesson taught.\n\nHopefully that'll be enough to smooth this all over.  Good luck.", "NTA.
