Given the expense and hassle of changing flights, I can't imagine you would have gotten home much earlier. Just from a purely practical standpoint, in your shoes, I'd actually have a ton more stress over trying to get home early (I live in the US so our airlines are just awful). I'd have to fly standby, I'd have to eat a bunch of costs, I like a plan so having it up in the air would make me anxious, and I would make it home... a day early, if the travel gods were on my side? \n\nMaybe if this was a 2 week trip I'd feel differently, but you were home fairly soon after the news, you were there for the funeral, you asked your mom what she needed from you. \n\nI think sometimes when death happens, people want to be mad at something, and in this case, they are directing their anger at you because being mad at death isn't particularly satisfying. Give your mom a few days and reach out. You don't owe her an apology, but you can give her some grace in her grief and take the high road and just say \"Mom, I love you and I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel like I wasn't there for you, I did think things were okay and I misread your emotions.  I'm here for you now and I want to be here for you and with you, and I certainly don't want you angry at me now when you are already sad.

Everything else had been pre-arranged and paid for long since. We could have ended our trip early but at best that would have put us home only a day before our scheduled return. I left the choice up to Husband, and he opted to continue. Yes, he was upset, but also somewhat relieved. His father had end-stage Alzheimer's  and the family had done a lot of ... I guess you'd call it \"pre-grieving.\" FIL's personality had already died, and all the family could do was wait for his body to finally give up.", "NTA. Maybe when the actual work of planning the funeral and arrangements started, they realized that perhaps you could have been able to help more.

Had they come to you and calmly, and respectfully expressed their feelings about you not immediately coming home, I can see how you might want to reflect on what you did or did not do and how you may have unintentionally caused them more pain. However, what they did was wait until only a DAY after the funeral to gang up on you and attack you with how they felt. Did they show any regard to how you were feeling when they berated you and argued with you? No. If they cannot communicate as adults then they don't deserve your concern because you are also grieving.

She might have remembered you as a baby, remembered something like making  you a special quilt or taking you to the county fair carnival, but not remembered that you grew up. And it would be really confusing for her to be told \"I'm your grandchild OP\" when yesterday you were just an infant. She might even have thought that your mom(?)  was only a small child and that would be even more confusing. How could her 5-year-old have grown children? \n\nMy own mother, near the end, didn't remember that my father, her husband of 72 years, had died. She would say \"Your dad was just here a moment ago.
