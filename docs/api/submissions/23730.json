So I expressed my condoleances and asked how she's doing. She said that she's okay-ish but very sad but that she was with my brother and sister and that they're going to organise the funural with the three of them. I asked her if there's anything that she needs from me and she said no, that she just wanted to let me know.\nSo I hang up and went on my vacationy way. Ofcourse I was sad too, but I'm quite a practical girl and it's not as if I could say any goodbye to my grandmother because she had already died. (I know that's probably gonna rub some people the wrong way, but I couldn't change anything about the fact that she already died)\n\nSo my vacation ended and I got back home and two days after I got back, we had the funeral. A day after the funeral  I got in a huge fight with my mother and sister about me not coming home from my trip after the news that my grandmother had died. How I could do that to them and me being so selfish. So I expressed to them, that they hadnt asked me to come home once, and that in my eyes there was no need to come back home earlier, since I would be back on time to attend the funural. I can imagine they would've liked it for me to have come home, but they hadnt asked me becasue if the wouldve, id probably gone home., And as I said before, for me it wasn't necessary. \n\nTl:dr: grandmother died while I was on a 5 day trip. Got back before the funeral, attenderen said funeral, got into a huge fight with my mom and sister on how selfish I am for completing my trip and not coming back earlier. \n\nAm I the Asshole...?\n\nEdit: I live in Europe and it would've taken me atleast 18 hours to get back home. Think about buying new tickets, getting to the airport, flying and also public transportation back home after landing.\n\nEdit2: since it isnt really clear why I didnt go back immediately, i wanted to explain a little bit about my family dynamic.\n\nMy grandma had alzheimers and didn't recognise me anymore as her grandchild. But only me, everyone else she did still remember. It is absolutely not her fault, I know that and that fact does alot to my feelings. So I always felt like an imposter everytime we did something with the whole family. This feeling resurfaced when I heard about her dying, and staying away felt more appropriate (read: easier) than going back. Also, I'm the youngest of the siblings and even if I were to be there for organisational purposes, they wouldn't have let me (I know this because it has happened before, even me planning my own birthday party) oh btw I'm 24 now and now live on my own.  Also, my family are not the emotional type and I am, so I feel like if I were to go home, they would only be annoyed by my tears. \n\nI didn't put this in the initial post because I feel like this is more subjective and I wanted to ask the AITA question based on more objective events.", "created_utc": 1690984903, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15g9q4q/aita_am_i_the_asshole_for_not_breaking_off_my/", "score": 142, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Given the expense and hassle of changing flights, I can't imagine you would have gotten home much earlier. Just from a purely practical standpoint, in your shoes, I'd actually have a ton more stress over trying to get home early (I live in the US so our airlines are just awful). I'd have to fly standby, I'd have to eat a bunch of costs, I like a plan so having it up in the air would make me anxious, and I would make it home... a day early, if the travel gods were on my side? \n\nMaybe if this was a 2 week trip I'd feel differently, but you were home fairly soon after the news, you were there for the funeral, you asked your mom what she needed from you. \n\nI think sometimes when death happens, people want to be mad at something, and in this case, they are directing their anger at you because being mad at death isn't particularly satisfying. Give your mom a few days and reach out. You don't owe her an apology, but you can give her some grace in her grief and take the high road and just say \"Mom, I love you and I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make you feel like I wasn't there for you, I did think things were okay and I misread your emotions.  I'm here for you now and I want to be here for you and with you, and I certainly don't want you angry at me now when you are already sad. Can you accept my apology and can we grieve together?\"", "NAH\nwhat you did was the most practical thing. \nI guess from their pov they see it like this:\n\n1) you say you were able to attend the funeral. But obviously you took no part in organizing it. Having organized my MILs funeral last year, I can tell you it's a lot of work and the people organizing need all the help they can get\n\n2) while you don't sound particularly close to your Gma, I'm guessing your mother was grieving a lot more since that's her mother. So she had to grieve and organize the funeral\n\n3) I'm guessing your sister also helped organize the funeral plus had to take onmmost of the burden of comforting your mother too\n\nTheir emotions were also high plus they had to see to so many other things as well.", "NTA \n\nJudging by the way you wrote you\u2019re probably not super close with your grandma? It might be different if you could say your goodbyes if you made it home but since she has passed (may she RIP), plus you can make it to the funeral, I think it\u2019s fine. If they wanted you to be back for support they should have asked.", "NTA. My mother always told us that if she died while we were on vacation, that no one was to tell us until we got home. My in-laws said the same. \n\nA friend was in Cuba when she got the word that her mother died. She cried the entire flight home on her already scheduled flight the next day and then had to drive from the airport on the country's busiest highway.

You could have easily spent one of those days in the airport, more if the connections didn't play out perfectly.

Everything else had been pre-arranged and paid for long since. We could have ended our trip early but at best that would have put us home only a day before our scheduled return. I left the choice up to Husband, and he opted to continue. Yes, he was upset, but also somewhat relieved. His father had end-stage Alzheimer's  and the family had done a lot of ... I guess you'd call it \"pre-grieving.\" FIL's personality had already died, and all the family could do was wait for his body to finally give up.", "NTA.

Had they come to you and calmly, and respectfully expressed their feelings about you not immediately coming home, I can see how you might want to reflect on what you did or did not do and how you may have unintentionally caused them more pain. However, what they did was wait until only a DAY after the funeral to gang up on you and attack you with how they felt. Did they show any regard to how you were feeling when they berated you and argued with you? No. If they cannot communicate as adults then they don't deserve your concern because you are also grieving. Grief and being family does not give others the right to use those emotions as weapons against others.", "Yea, they should have expressed their wishes.

I know it hurts that your grandmother didn't recognize you, but that is an unfortunate factor of the disease. Memories tend to disappear in reverse order, so that the newest ones, the ones that have the least impact on your brain, the ones that you don't reinforce by remembering over and over, get lost first.  She might have remembered you as a baby, remembered something like making  you a special quilt or taking you to the county fair carnival, but not remembered that you grew up. And it would be really confusing for her to be told \"I'm your grandchild OP\" when yesterday you were just an infant. She might even have thought that your mom(?)  was only a small child and that would be even more confusing. How could her 5-year-old have grown children? \n\nMy own mother, near the end, didn't remember that my father, her husband of 72 years, had died. She would say \"Your dad was just here a moment ago. I wonder where he went?\" (We told her he'd gone to the hardware store.)

It's not that he's unwilling , he just needs direction first.

That\u2019s where the healing comes in. \n\nWhen someone refuses to take accountability for their behavior and blames you, it\u2019s manipulative. Your mom is making you responsible for things that you shouldn\u2019t be responsible for (it\u2019s her responsibility).
