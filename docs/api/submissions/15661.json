I commend OP for actually seeing when he's in the wrong and listening to people's advice, unlike most AITA posts where the asshole posts just for self validation and don't actually want to be called out and would stubbornly stick to their actions.\n\nMeanwhile OP here listens and actively tries to improve his course of action. No pleasing redditors i guess. Take my upvote.", "You seem like you are very devoted to her which is wonderful. It just makes me wonder why you would need to come here? You seem to genuinely care for and respect her, so why did you need other people to tell you that you were being controlling about this? Next time, take the time to ask her how she feels and listen. If you are this open to feedback from strangers, you should be able to work through these things directly with her.", "Don't mind what she says when it's time to wake up. It's the conversations that happen when she's already awake that matter. What if she set her own alarm in the morning and you'd try to get her up only after it has rung and if she's not getting up? Anyhow it'd be good to have a new convo. It's not nice of you are left feeling like an ass.", "So your parents never wake you up when you had to go to school?\nAnd you were never annoyed that you have to get up early for a job, doctors appointment or feeding kids, pets or because someone is knocking on your door?", "Actually I don\u2019t remember my parents waking me up, but they certainly did when I was in preschool. But I want to add that I was not an adult back than. If I have to get up early for a job, than it was my decision to take that job, so it was also my decision to wake up early, not anybody elses, same goes for appointments. I don\u2019t have kids and will never have any, another decision of my own. If I would have kids or pets that would require me to get up early, than that would have been my decision to get them in my life. If someone is knocking at my door unannounced before I wake up, well, too bad, I won\u2019t answer. People forget that most of the stuff that annoys them is their own choice.", "NTA\n\nThe comment section is ridiculous. I have dealt with depression for over 20 years now, even being in the psych ward for some time. \n\nHealthy sleeping patterns and exercise is absolutely crucial for personal well-being. Of course that's not the the only thing that has to be done, but it still is elementary. \n\nSince you mentioned that your GF is also reading the comments, this is for her: Again, regular sleep is essential. If you don't believe a random stranger: Read up on it. There's plenty of research how sleep hygiene is affecting one's personal health. That doesn't mean you can never sleep in, just that it shouldn't be your regular thing. Take care of yourself, I know it's a challenge often enough, but it's well worth the effort.", "NAH, for two reasons:\n\n1) I see in your comments that GF has asked for help waking up and getting out of bed in the mornings. I can see it being confusing on whether she still wants that help or not.\n\n2) Having watched my fianc\u00e9 crash and burn over the past three years from depression and ADHD (un-medicated) during this pandemic, I can say that sticking to a healthy routine at the early stages of a new environment will save everyone\u2019s mental health in the long run.  Not to say the ends justify the means, but your boundary is objectively a healthy one, if it\u2019s something discussed and agreed upon already.\n\nTL;DR check out the relationship advice subreddits, just communicate with your GF on if she still wants your help waking up or not", "YTA. I stay in bed past 10am whenever I can. I have no mental health issues. I just like my sleep!", "Based on your responses it seems like you have a pretty decent handle on this so I'll just give some advice if you're amenable; the crux here is finding what your GF actually would find helpful. For me, having someone help me wake up on time WOULD be helpful, bc that's something I struggle with, and want to improve. But you need to have a conversation with her about it. For me also, I think it would be better to have someone just start having a conservation with me vs just \"get out of bed\" bc it makes your brain wake up more to start engaging. But again, ask her!", "YTA. She's an adult and it's not your job to enforce when she gets up; that's incredibly infantilising and controlling. The only time it's acceptable to treat an adult that way is if she asks you for help encouraging her to get up in the mornings. Failing that, YTA.", "For me, I can no longer support people who won\u2019t help themselves. It\u2019s too taxing on my own mental health. Even with some of my family members, and don\u2019t get me wrong, it sucks. But I can\u2019t make them change for the better, and I won\u2019t support what they\u2019re doing to themselves. \n\nIt sucks, but I\u2019d rather be alone and bide my time waiting for a capable and mature partner, rather than writing any more blank cheques for people who have self-destructive habits\n\nIf you have to or feel compelled to \u201cparent\u201d your partner, then it\u2019s probably not going to be a very healthy relationship imo", "I see you've talked to her and shown her this post. Just want to say please communicate both of you. Figure out what your goals are for both of you as individual and how each of you can **support** each other.", "Going against the grain and going NTA.\n\nBut perhaps you are just not compatible. \n\nIt would drive me nuts if my partner wasted half a day on the weekend sleeping in when we could have been out & about doing things like golfing, the farmers market, hiking, walking the dog to the park, grabbing brunch.\n\nI get why you want her up - likely so you can spend time together and make the most of the day.\n\nBut perhaps her idea of relaxing on the weekends differs vastly from yours. She wants to sleep in, for whatever reason (mental illness or personal preference) and you don\u2019t. \n\nAnd that will have to be addressed at some point.\n\nThere has to be compromise here too. \n\nWhy not agree to both get up earlier on Saturday and sleep in as late as you each pleases on Sunday.", "YTA but I will change it to N T A if I can also live with your parents for free and have them buy me stuff", "As someone who sleeps late and wakes up late, who also suffers from depression and what not. Youre an asshole. Some people are night owls and others early birds. I would resent my partner so fast if they kept waking me up early when i sleep at 3-4pm just because they feel like youre worthless if you dont get up early. \nHer depression may cause insomnia. And its been proven that people who regularly get less than 6hours of sleep, are more vulnerable for Alzheimer, dementia, strokes, aneurysms, heart attacks etc. \nSo let her sleep for the sake of the lord. \nMake sure she feels well during the day. Depression usually kicks in when youre alone with your thoughts, aka late at night/before bed.", "NTA. \n\nIf the roles were reversed people here would be blasting you for living in your gfs place rent free and calling you lazy for sleeping in while she works and makes you breakfast in bed. \n\nThat said maybe just chill with it for a month and let her laze about. If after a month she\u2019s still on this then check on her depression to see if it\u2019s getting worse with no routine.", "YTA it\u2019s not up to you to dictate her wake up time. She\u2019s your partner not your child.", "I just wanted to hijack the top comment and point out that OP was asked by GF to help get her up in the mornings \u2014 per her psychologist\u2019s advice, she doesn\u2019t want to be in bed all day. How long OP is supposed to help her with it is a bit unclear, but to me that screams of either NAH or NTA.", "Seems like that would be some vital need-to-know info", "Yeah, but sleeping late doesn't necessarily mean she's lying around doing nothing productive, nor does it mean she's \"not functioning.\" Some people genuinely do way better going to bed late and sleeping in. \n\nPlus, she might also be physically exhausted from doing grad school with both depression and possible CPTSD. Trauma especially can mean that regular tasks can be way more draining than necessary. If OP thinks she needs to relax for a couple months there's probably a good reason for that.", "She\u2019s an adult.", "His parents were the ones saying she doesn't have to pay", "Yeah, but this also seems like a really mild situation in the first place, so perhaps OP is wildly insecure.", "Yes but she's living on other people's dime who may not want her to do that forever.", "He's already responded in other questions that she's an intelligent person and has multiple job offers and recruiters contacting her without even applying. She's just taking a break right now. Which he is encouraging her to do. Even in the comments he is explicitly stating that both heat and his parents are encouraging her to take a break right now and not necessarily go out and get a job right away. So in this specific situation your argument really makes no sense.", "My point is that if she gets too far into unhealthy and depressive habits, it might harder for her to decide to go back to work and she could lose out on all that she's worked so hard for. You can take a break while still maintaining healthy habits.", "Put yourself in OPs shoes. Someone you love is suffering. A medical professional recommends they do something that, to you, seems easy. Instead of doing that one seemingly simple thing they do the exact opposite while you continue to watch them suffer. Would that not affect you? Would you not be encouraging them to do that simple task? I'm not saying OP isn't the asshole for how they're going about you must on some level understand how they're feeling.", "No it's not jfc", "But getting up early is not a healthy habit by default, if the GF is a night owl then getting up early will mess her sleep schedule also OP gives no indication of what the normal sleep schedule was before GF moved in.\n\nYou can have healthy sleep habits without getting up early and we don't have enough information about the whole situation to know if it's unhealthy or abnormal for GF  to sleep till late", "If there's one thing I've learned about redditor mindset from this sub alone it's that every AH is causing the conflict maliciously. My personal judgement would be NAH because I understand where OP is coming from completely but like the gf, I value my sleep and my mental health definitely plays a part in how much I (over) sleep or stay in bed. \n\nNot to mention most medical professionals would *absolutely* encourage their patient's loved ones to help encourage taking steps necessary to improve their mental or physical health. Idk why that other commented thinks him trying to help her follow her psychologist's advice is a bad thing.", "I have a friend whose house I sometimes crash at, and he has asked me to get him up at a certain time before. The first time I did it, he whined and complained and said he changed his mind, then went right back to sleep. The second time he asked, I laid out how it went the first time and said I'd do it once more but if that experience repeated I'd never do it again. I'm his friend, not his mother or an alarm clock.\n\nSlightly different situation here, but the same applies. I think you have good intentions, but you aren't her mother or her alarm clock. She gets one wakeup prompt from you at the time SHE specifies, and then all bets are off. If her mental health is dragging her down, or keeping her in bed, she and her therapist need to discuss why and what steps she can take to manage the problem."]}
