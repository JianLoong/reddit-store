We have a 14 year old son, and Pam has a younger brother (28, let\u2019s call him Dwight). Dwight, his pregnant wife Angela (24) have been facing financial difficulties.\n\n\r  \nAround six months ago, Dwight reached out to me for help finding a new job. He said he quit the previous job I found for him, claiming an \"abusive work environment,\" and said he needed a new job urgently since his wife was about to give birth. I own an auto repair shop among other businesses, so I offered him a job at the shop, because I believed Dwight was interested in cars. Pam supported this idea, hoping it would provide him with a stable job.\n\n\r  \nHowever, over the subsequent months, it became evident that Dwight wasn\u2019t committed to the job. Instead of helping and learning, he spent his time watching anime on his phone. He frequently arrived late, left without notice, and was generally unproductive.\n\n\r  \nThe cars we repair are usually expensive cars. So, some of our customers appreciate it when we pick up and deliver their cars. In an effort to give him responsibilities, I assigned Dwight to manage customer car deliveries (which happened just a few times per week), a task he continued to perform poorly.\n\n\r  \nThe tipping point occurred when I gave Dwight a customer's car to deliver, but he called and said his wife Angela needed to go to the hospital. It wasn\u2019t anything serious but he couldn\u2019t deliver the car. I said I could handle it myself, but he said he could do it first thing in the morning.\n\n\r  \nThe next morning at 4 am, my phone rang. It was Dwight. He said he crashed the car he was supposed to deliver. In short, he decided to drive the car to his hometown to \"see his boys\", got drunk, and crashed 150 km away from home on his way back. Miraculously, he wasn\u2019t seriously injured. But he trashed the car so I had to replace it. He damaged a lot of roadside barriers as well. The whole thing cost me about $70,000.\n\n\r  \nThe next day I fired Dwight, despite my mother-in-law's attempts to intervene. I felt Dwight was a risk to my businesses and couldn't be tolerated. (I also own nightclubs, hotels, etc. All businesses that people leave their cars. People know me here, they talk.) This decision caused a rift in the family, with my wife's parents and other relatives siding with Dwight, and pressuring me to reconsider.\n\n\r  \nAs a result of her family's influence, a week after the incident Pam changed her stance and started to want me to hire Dwight again. This was an unexpected shift, as she fully supported my decision at first. I also engaged in a heated confrontation with my in-laws, but I stood my ground and refused to apologize for my decision.\n\n\r  \nI now find myself isolated from my family (my in-laws, my wife, and my son) who all believe I was harsh and unreasonable towards Dwight. I don't think I was, so I can't bring myself to apologize. Am I the asshole here, Reddit? I don't think I am, so I need other perspectives.\r  \n\r  \n", "created_utc": 1692882007, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1601aqx/aita_for_firing_my_brotherinlaw/", "score": 183, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

After a year, he got married there, and he started working for the first time in his life (he was 24 at the time, btw).

He couldn't find a job for 4 months into her pregnancy. \n\n\r  \nAt that point, Pam asked me to find a job for him using my connections and asked if Dwight and Angela could move into a house we owned in our city. We weren't planning on renting out that house anyway, we were using it as a summerhouse, so I said okay. I found a job for him in a restaurant as a cashier. I got the house cleaned for them, helped them move, etc. I even helped them make a nursery room in their new house, without allowing them to spend any money. They were family after all.\n\n\r  \nHe worked at that restaurant for the next 4 months until I got that call from him I mentioned in the post. \n\n\r  \nIn my eyes, I gave him the best job he could find; he only worked 5 days a week, came and went whenever he pleased, his only job was to drive some cars a few times a week, and he got paid more than he made from any other job before.

Wanting to support my family, I got Dwight a job at a restaurant and gave them a free place to stay. For whatever reason, this job did not work. I gave him a job at one of my companies and paid him a full time salary for minimal work. \n\nDwight stole a car from my business, drove it drunk, and got into an accident. While I\u2019m happy he was not hurt, I had to pay X amount to fix the newly repaired car again and X amount to fix the roads. He is lucky he was not arrested for a DUI and he is lucky I did not press charges for stealing the car, not to mention serious harming himself. \n\nAll of my companies deal with cars. I rely on word of mouth for my business. People talk and they will not use my businesses if they know that I am employing Dwight and that he had access to the cars. If I lose business, how can I support my wife and children? If I lose business, how can I maintain the house that Dwight and Angela live in for free? How can I pay for my family\u2019s health care and future education?\n\nAgain, I understand you are worried about how they will pay for the baby. I cannot risk my businesses because my family needs to come first. Do you see a solution where I can provide him with a job without risking my livelihood? Once the $70,000 he cost me is paid back, than we can discuss options. Until then, this is not up for discussion.\u201d\n\nDocument everything. This includes all conversations with your wife and about your kids. I\u2019m concerned that this will be the hill she chooses to die on by asking for a divorce. If she does, get a lawyer asap. Use the documentation to show you have been trying to see your children but she is denying contact. If she tries to alienate them against you, use the documentation to show them your side of the conversation. \n\nBest of luck and keep us posted", "I can see why Dwight is behaving as he is.\n\nHe has a whole family enabling his bad behavior. He should move back in with his parents. They created that mess, they need to deal with it.\n\n\nAlso, this is a lesson for your son. On how NOT to behave. He sees Dwight getting rewarded for bad behavior, he might think that's the way to behave. He sees consequences and will know not to end up like Dwight.\n\nNTA\n\n\nEdit: Your son maybe sees Dwight as this cool uncle. If so, that myth needs to be shattered. Dwight needs to take responsibility for his actions. Or be made to do so. Or lose out on all the perks of having you as his relative.\n\nYour wife needs to get on board, stop enabling her brother and his sabotaging of you and your livelihood.\n\nEdited.", "Tell her they are lucky you didn't have him arrested for Grand Theft Auto.
