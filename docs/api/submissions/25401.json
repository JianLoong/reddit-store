We have a 14 year old son, and Pam has a younger brother (28, let\u2019s call him Dwight). Dwight, his pregnant wife Angela (24) have been facing financial difficulties.\n\n\r  \nAround six months ago, Dwight reached out to me for help finding a new job. He said he quit the previous job I found for him, claiming an \"abusive work environment,\" and said he needed a new job urgently since his wife was about to give birth. I own an auto repair shop among other businesses, so I offered him a job at the shop, because I believed Dwight was interested in cars. Pam supported this idea, hoping it would provide him with a stable job.\n\n\r  \nHowever, over the subsequent months, it became evident that Dwight wasn\u2019t committed to the job. Instead of helping and learning, he spent his time watching anime on his phone. He frequently arrived late, left without notice, and was generally unproductive.\n\n\r  \nThe cars we repair are usually expensive cars. So, some of our customers appreciate it when we pick up and deliver their cars. In an effort to give him responsibilities, I assigned Dwight to manage customer car deliveries (which happened just a few times per week), a task he continued to perform poorly.\n\n\r  \nThe tipping point occurred when I gave Dwight a customer's car to deliver, but he called and said his wife Angela needed to go to the hospital. It wasn\u2019t anything serious but he couldn\u2019t deliver the car. I said I could handle it myself, but he said he could do it first thing in the morning.\n\n\r  \nThe next morning at 4 am, my phone rang. It was Dwight. He said he crashed the car he was supposed to deliver. In short, he decided to drive the car to his hometown to \"see his boys\", got drunk, and crashed 150 km away from home on his way back. Miraculously, he wasn\u2019t seriously injured. But he trashed the car so I had to replace it. He damaged a lot of roadside barriers as well. The whole thing cost me about $70,000.\n\n\r  \nThe next day I fired Dwight, despite my mother-in-law's attempts to intervene. I felt Dwight was a risk to my businesses and couldn't be tolerated. (I also own nightclubs, hotels, etc. All businesses that people leave their cars. People know me here, they talk.) This decision caused a rift in the family, with my wife's parents and other relatives siding with Dwight, and pressuring me to reconsider.\n\n\r  \nAs a result of her family's influence, a week after the incident Pam changed her stance and started to want me to hire Dwight again. This was an unexpected shift, as she fully supported my decision at first. I also engaged in a heated confrontation with my in-laws, but I stood my ground and refused to apologize for my decision.\n\n\r  \nI now find myself isolated from my family (my in-laws, my wife, and my son) who all believe I was harsh and unreasonable towards Dwight. I don't think I was, so I can't bring myself to apologize. Am I the asshole here, Reddit? I don't think I am, so I need other perspectives.\r  \n\r  \n", "created_utc": 1692882007, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1601aqx/aita_for_firing_my_brotherinlaw/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have to protect your business and finances. \n\nIf everyone thinks you're an asshole and should re-hire Dwight, tell them you'll consider it AFTER he/they have repaid the $70k irresponsible screw up that got him fired to begin with.", "NTA, it'd be idiotic and irresponsible to keep an employee who shows he's unable to perform even the simplest of tasks much less actually show up on time. And he costed you/your business $70,000 when he decided to take another customers vehicle out for a joyride 150km away, he's lucky you didn't call the police and have his ass arrested.

Since Dwight lived with them and didn't have a job to support himself at the time, he also moved. After a year, he got married there, and he started working for the first time in his life (he was 24 at the time, btw). For years, he was getting in and out of jobs, not lasting more than 3 months in any of them. He was unemployed when his wife got pregnant. He couldn't find a job for 4 months into her pregnancy. \n\n\r  \nAt that point, Pam asked me to find a job for him using my connections and asked if Dwight and Angela could move into a house we owned in our city. We weren't planning on renting out that house anyway, we were using it as a summerhouse, so I said okay. I found a job for him in a restaurant as a cashier. I got the house cleaned for them, helped them move, etc. I even helped them make a nursery room in their new house, without allowing them to spend any money. They were family after all.\n\n\r  \nHe worked at that restaurant for the next 4 months until I got that call from him I mentioned in the post. \n\n\r  \nIn my eyes, I gave him the best job he could find; he only worked 5 days a week, came and went whenever he pleased, his only job was to drive some cars a few times a week, and he got paid more than he made from any other job before. And he f\\*cked that up.\n\n\r  \nBtw, English is not my first language and it's been a while since I lived in an English-speaking country, so I might make some grammar mistakes, so I apologize if I made any.", "He\u2019s destroying your business.

This is messy but you can fire him for whatever you want; that has nothing to do with family.

Totally NTA.\n\nMany people would've been happy to have a simple and almost fun job like that. He gets it without working for it and ruins an entire car. You've totally done your part as a BIL and then some. If your wife can't see the damage he could potentially cause again then you might want to reconsider this wife. She's ridiculous.", "Nta if Dwight had financial problems he should actually work hard and be responsible, you gave him a job and he caused troubles for you in the end. I wouldn't trust Dwight after what he did. And this is an speculation but I feel Dwight is the reason they have financial problems in the first place.", "NTA, although if you want to appease your wife you could offer him a job as a cleaner.  I get the impression your BIL wouldn't take the job but you can say you tried.", "NTA, he was a risk to your business. Employees are supposed to bring value to you business while getting paid for the value they bring.

He\u2019s a fuckwit", "NTA - family, so very rarely good business or employees but always ends up in drama. The family (and even your wife?!) see you as a wallet, you're an entrepreneur... you got a reputation to upkeep or as you said, people talk, and trust will erode until your business takes a hit. If that employee wasn't family I bet you would of fired him way before it got to the accident.\n\nHe stole a client's car, for a joyride, and damaged property, while drunk. He's lucky he's not in jail is all I'd be telling the family. The wife not taking your side / flipping because of family pressure is just gut-wrenching IMO, that's just not right.\n\nI would definitely not hire Dwight ever again. This isn't just \"everybody deserves a second chance\", he technically burned his chances one by one until it ended in disaster. He needs a life lesson, and sadly his pregnant wife will end up catching flak for his stupidity.", "Get a lawyer and start looking into a divorce. Any family this stupid is too toxic for you.", "NTA - You have the patience of a saint. I would be throwing them out of the house you put them up in and taking him to court for the money he cost you.

His family is not doing Dwight any favors by never making him have to face consequences of his actions.  They are why Dwight is lazy & gets away with too much!  They allow it or make lame excuses for him. \n\nHe took some else's car,  got drunk & wrecked it!  It cost you lots of money!  He is a liability to your business & income.  How can your wife not understand that Dwight's actions can have serious repercussions on your business & income for your family. Does she expect you to support Dwight & his growing family forever?!  You have already provided him a home (good luck ever getting him out of it! ) & multiple job opportunities that he's botched.  \nDwight is not a child (but acts like one) & you are not his parent nor responsible for him.  \nYou've done more than enough for him,  is time for him to grow up, be a man & provide for his family! \n\nIf your wife has stopped taking to you over this,  I'd try to ask her a few things: \n1. Does she think Dwight is a good example for your son?  Does she want him to grow up & be like him? \n2. Did she still think/ feel that supporting Dwight as you have been is reasonable & sustainable even if it costs you business & a bad reputation? \n3. Is she so adamant about supporting Dwight that if you were to divorce,  that his continued upkeep will come out of her settlement funds? Basically if she gets the 'summer home' in a divorce,  is she still going to let Dwight live there free of charge among other things.  \n\nYour wife & IL's are being ridiculous & unreasonable.  Dwight is... well,  I can't say exactly WHAT Dwight is because reddit will ban me. Lol.", "NTA. A reputation lost is nearly impossible to get back.
