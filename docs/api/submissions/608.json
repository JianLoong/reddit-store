As a night owl with insomnia and now a chronic illness sleep is catch as catch can.  Not everyone is meant to be an early bird.", "YTA. \n\nSeriously? You want to stop being friends with someone because their sleep habits aren't what you want them to be? \n\nYou really need to deal with the fact you can't control other people. They'll need to figure out their sleep things on their own.", "Soft YTA - I understand that it not a good feeling, but it is their choice to make. Your friend is not responsible for your anxieties.", "YTA. They\u2019re an adult and can handle their own bed time. Having your sleep schedule (which sounds like a nightmare to me) doesn\u2019t fit everyone. Some people work better at night", "YTA. I understand you\u2019re concerned for your friend, but unless they\u2019re asking you for help, leave them alone. I know sleep plays a major part in health, but you lowkey make it sound like they\u2019re doing heroin or something. So many people have messed up sleep schedules for a variety of reasons. It\u2019s rarely an easy fix.", "[deleted]", "YTA\n\nOnly if you break up a friendship for that. Not everyone has the same cycle of sleep. Even though your friend could probably do way better. I know how important sleep is to peoples overall health and focus. \n\nSo, I\u2019m up too late now, so off to bed.", "Man I've heard it all now. Wanting to break off a friendship because of their sleep schedule? \n\nYTA", "Unless yall are sleeping together in the same bed then yeah YTA. Leave people alone about how they sleep. Stop bringing it up unless they actually ask you questions about it. It is concerning you are this worked up over how someone else is sleeping.", "YTA. I guess. But I have no idea why you think so much about a person's sleep schedule if they're not even a very good friend? \n\nHere's the thing: Everybody's different. People need different things. If you go around the world thinking that everybody else is doing a bad job of being you? It makes you an asshole.", "YTA, this is up to your friend, not you. You\u2019re not in an intimate relationship with them where these things may be more relevant to discuss, but not everyone is going to have the same sleep schedule that you have. Some people are night owls, and some are not. There is research that even suggests this could be part of an individual\u2019s genetics. It\u2019s not like they are doing hard drugs that might kill them, they\u2019re just not sleeping when YOU prefer them to sleep, and frankly it\u2019s none of your business.", "YTA \n\nYour friend is an adult. They'll fix their sleep schedule when they get a job. It's not your job to make sure they go to bed early", "Are they getting ENOUGH sleep because if so their sleep schedule isn\u2019t unhealthy merely different than yours", "YTA. They did not ask for your advice and they know exactly how you feel. There's no point in repeating it. It's weird that you're getting so anxious when this really isn't any of your business. I think this is one of those situations where you need to check yourself, take a deep breath, and refocus your attention to something more appropriate. You've already done all that you can do.", "YTA. I understand that you care about your friend but you are overstepping, it is not your job to parent them. You have mentioned what you think now it's up to your friend to either sort it out or continue the way they are.", "YTA back up off their business.", "Little YTA.\n\nYou need to let this go, you're allowed to have your own opinion about how her sleep schedule sucks, but that's about it. It's a little strange that you are so invested/worried about your friends sleep schedule. It's really a normal friend thing to nag someone about their sleep?\n\nIf this is really getting to you and making you actually crazy, then break off the friendship...bu may I offer a suggestion? Maybe there is something going on in your life that you're getting yourself so worked up over this? You might want to consider possibly talking to someone even just a few times to see why this makes you crazy, sometime a professional can help you work through the issues you may have!", "Yeah YTA and weird tbh. Caring about a friend is one thing... This is bizarre.\n\nIs your friend depressed? Falling behind in classes? Not looking after responsibilities? Eating? Etc? \n\nOr is the sleep schedule the ONLY reason you're worried? Cuz people have different sleep schedules y'know. 6 hrs is enough for most people. Your sleep schedule isn't automatically \"healthy\".\n\nAnd being on the phone before sleeping helps a lot of people sleep better (me for example). It helps me not overthink, which would keep me up longer.\n\nIf it works for your friends schedule, what's the issue? I'm used to working better at nights than during the day. My mind is just more clear and I'm more motivated.\n\nSigned - person awake currently at 2:28am and will probably get 6 hrs of sleep and will be fully rested.\n\nEdit: I also have one friend who literally is the smartest person I know and has an amazing job and his sleep schedule is like your friends. Weekends, he goes to sleep at 6 am and wakes up after 2pm. It works for him.\n\nJust cuz its not like your sleep schedule doesn't mean it's self destructive. You're overstepping a LOT.", "Yta- you can\u2019t control how your friend sleeps and you have to accept that. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s coming from a good place, it is controlling and a little strange tbh to be so obsessed over someone else\u2019s sleeping pattern.", "YTA and it's literally none of your business some people thrive better at night, worry about yourself.", "YTA, this isn\u2019t your business.", "Mild YTA.

I generally don't get more than 5 hours during the week because I work a standard work hours job now. My body clock isn't set to morning people hours.

Just let your friend be unless they come to you specifically asking on advice on how to sleep just like you."]}
