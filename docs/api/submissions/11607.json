I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Your kids are going to have to understand that this situation is not ideal for any of you and you are all trying to adjust. Teens don\u2019t have all of the insight of an adult, but your kids are old enough to understand what\u2019s going on. You may have to be completely honest with them about how poor the situation really is (not being able to feed everyone). If they truly want to help change things, they can offer to babysit while you get another job or could even try working a few hours, but, for now, they will have to accept that this is how life is and that you are doing everything you can to just provide for their basic needs.", "NAH I\u2019m so sorry about your situation.

Im so sorry you are going through this. Assuming you are UK (cause food bank) have you looked into benefits? Or a council house? Can talk to citizens advice?", "NTA, and I feel like your teen kids are being too harsh. They\u2019re refusing to look after the baby just because it\u2019s not their responsibility? Throughout my 19 years of existence, I\u2019ve had to babysit my little siblings\u2026 like A LOT. They may be annoyed by this, but if I were you as the parent, I\u2019d make it their responsibility to look after the baby so you can perhaps work more.

I'm very sorry for your loss, and it sounds like your kids are trying to cling to a sense of normalcy during a time of very intense grieving and change. That being said, it's understandable that you can't provide the same lifestyle they were accustomed to previously. There's no shame in using the food bank, and you're doing what you can to keep them fed and safe. I hope you're able to do the same for yourself soon too, and that in the future they're able to look back and recognize the sacrifices that you made for them.", "NTA but equally your children are NTA for complaining about their living situation. Sounds like a horrible circumstance overall.\n\nFWIW in UK law a house/flat is considered overcrowded if two people (including siblings) aged over 10 years old and of the opposite gender have to share a room. \n\nIf a family home is overcrowded then you would be technically considered homeless and able to apply for social housing. \n\nI assume its different in the US, but worth noting that as a short term solution its probably fine but if its a long term solution then it may affect the health/wellbeing of your children. \n\nI don't know if there is some social/local authority support in your area?", "Info so you have any family (his or yours) that can help you? Grandparents that can watch the little one? \n\nSo sorry for your loss. I don't think I'd want a two year old being watched by kids that don't want that responsibility though... \n\nNTA but have your son sleep in the living room.", "I'm so sorry you're in this position. NAH you're all grieving and probably in shock. Please (gently) tell your teenagers about the food bank, for a few reasons. First, if they know they may be more willing to help out with the 2yo and free up a bit more of your time. Second, it's not at all fair they they are having to grow up so fast, but keeping the full situation from them won't be good in the long run (or good for you! You need support too!) Finally - they deserve to know. They may be thinking all sorts of untrue and upsetting things in their grief, and being all on the same page really does make communication and compromise easier. It's the only way we really can compromise, and compromise is what you're (justifiably) asking of them. \n\nAlso, there's absolutely no shame in using food banks. They're there to be used. You're in a really difficult spot at the moment and your resilience in dealing with everything and using every resource at your disposal is impressive, not shameful <3", "NTA, but I think you should be honest with them. They\u2019re old enough to understand your family\u2019s financial hardship, and you\u2019re doing your best. They might also be having a difficult time coping with change though, counseling (maybe through a non-profit or some kind of sliding scale payment) might benefit everyone.", "NTA\n\nhope things will get better in the future. Kts nkt your fault this problem happend and rather having a room then none at all is what i think.", "NTA \n\nUnless there\u2019s a spare room your using to store your stamp collection. Your doing the best you can. Gotta work with what your got and hopefully they understand that", "I'm sorry you're going through this. This is the best solution though. Please do not make your oldest daughter share a room with a toddler though because they have the same genitals. That's unfair to her and will distract her much more so than the two older kids sharing a room. I'm upset that you immediately suggested your daughter take that responsibility on and not your son, even though he's older.... at the very least make them trade off. Jesus.", "NAH.\n\nYou're doing the best you can and trying to improve your situation as well as the situation for your kids.\n\nI do understand where your teenagers are coming from regarding caring for your daughter (although I wish they would help out just out of kindness) and about sharing a room.\n\nPerhaps you should tell your kids that if they want their own separate bedrooms the only way you can afford it is if they help out after daycare hours so that you can work a second job. They can make their choice from there.\n\nOverall just an unfortunate situation all around. I'm sorry that you and your family are going through this and hope the best for you all going forward.", "I hate to say it, but the asshole here is the late husband who didn't get a good life insurance policy so his family wouldn't be in this situation if he passed.", "NTA\nI am sorry for your loss and your situation. :( So I assume you life in the US? Is there any financial support by the state for mothers with 3 kids?", "I really want to say N A H here, but this is something you and your husband should have discussed before you ever got pregnant with your first kid. If you didn\u2019t have the means to provide a suitable living space for all your children, then you needed to not keep having children. It\u2019s not their fault and male and female teenagers need private space. \n\nI get that you\u2019re in a tough situation and maybe most of the fault goes to your husband on that. Maybe not. But you did have a responsibility that you\u2019re now failing at. \n\nHave you considered that part of why they don\u2019t want to help with childcare for the toddler is they know they need scholarships for college in order to not be saddled with thousands of dollars of students loans? They may have other plans for their future because it know that things aren\u2019t financially stable right now and if so, good for them. \n\nSo, soft YTA.", "NTA.\n\nIts a pity you raised your kids so poorly they arent even willing to take care of their younger sibling or share a room.

Not taking over her care, but if there is a problem in the night, she would be the first to need to deal with it. If the teen girl is unwilling to handle that, then offer it to your son.

Becoming a sudden widow without a life insurance policy to cradle you is awful, I get it.\n\nI hope the kids can find a way to ease up on you.

I\u2019m sorry for what you\u2019ve been through and what you\u2019re still going through. My best suggestion is to sit down with your two oldest kids and be completely honest with them. Explain the situation and ask them if they have a solution that could work for all four of you. If they don\u2019t, then it needs to stay as is. They may need to step up more than they have in the past, either by watching their younger sister or getting a part time job.

You are doing the best you can and sometimes that means less than ideal arrangements. It is clear you love your family. \n\nHowever, I completely understand their point of view.

To them, they have lost their father, their home, their privacy and basically their way of life as they knew it, that is really difficult to come to terms with. \n\nI would sit them down and talk to them about the situation, tell them again that at this moment you can not afford a bigger place but ask them if they have any ideas of how to make the situation better, maybe working on a solution together will give them some sense of control over their situation and help them understand your side of things. \n\nGood luck OP I hope everything works out", "NAH: it\u2019s time to tell the truth to the kids and show them how money works versus hiding it.

My only $.02 to add here: don't try to hide the situation from them - tell them there is no money and that if they want separate bedrooms, they can get a job to contribute, but that you have no money, and are using the food banks.  They should know the real situation and not think you're doing this on purpose.  The reason I say that is that they can transfer their grief and resentment to you in this current scenario, and that would just be such a sad coda to this tale.\n\nI hope you can find your footing and make your way better.  I'm sorry you feel shame for using a support that is meant to help you.  There is no shame in taking aid that you need.

Please know that I'm doing my best to take care of you, and I'm actively working to get us into a larger home as soon as possible. While I don't expect it, you can choose to work and contribute to the household to speed up the process. However, I can't help if you don't have any solutions for our current circumstances.

You can't magically make more bedrooms appear. You lost your husband, and they lost their dad. Everyone is going to be emotionally out of sorts. Kids tend to hate sharing rooms already but they're also probably in shitty emotional states and they're probably going to be inclined to lash out a little harder about this, even if they do logically get that you can't afford a bigger place. That doesn't make it better for you to deal with, but I really doubt they're just coming from a place of cruelty.\n\nI do think you should be honest with them about your financial situation and take them to the food bank with you. Hiding the reality will just reinforce any sense of injustice they feel, and telling them you're starving yourself for weight loss is not exactly a healthy thing for a kid to learn, either. You deserve to eat food too, and they will learn to empathize with you if they know what's actually happening. There's nothing shameful about needing social services. They exist to be used. You're a person in need, you get to use them.\n\nI don't know what housing assistance is like outside the US but here we have some programs for housing vouchers/low income housing. Maybe try looking into seeing if something exists in your country with helping with housing costs? As a single mother with three kids and low-income you would probably be eligible for some kind of assistance if these programs do exist.\n\nSomeone mentioned you + the girls sharing the bedroom and your son in the living room which honestly might be a better arrangement.

We had a 3bed apartment- my brother and I shared the master, my parents had the second bedroom, and our big age gap younger brother had the tiny room.

Teenagers are not known for their selflessness or empathy.", "Children aren't free babysitter's but surely they understand if they watch their brother you could work more?  Not that that's a great situation but probably necessary short term.

Not talking about them leads the kids to not properly understand how things work when they leave the nest. Then they start making the same mistakes their parents did simply because they didn\u2019t know about them. \n\nGiving them a choice to either watch the 2 year old or share a room is a fair one. \n\nThey are grieving the loss of their father and their lifestyle. Knowing why they are now sharing a room may ease some of the resentment they seem to have.\n\nI was a poor kid and we knew and never felt guilty. I work with poor kids. It\u2019s all in how you explain it to them. They aren\u2019t a burden but life has certain costs to it.", "There's a difference between explaining the situation to them, and making it their responsibility. It's a difficult balance to strike, but it is possible.", "The problem is there is an explicit difference between letting your kids understand sacrifices along with finite resources and making your problems their problems. \n\nMy youngest has zero concept of money. Honestly. She would use my debit card to get a list of items and come back with an extra dozen or so items. So, one day I had to show her how I budget with that account to pay for necessities and how the remaining balance wouldn\u2019t cover needs. She still doesn\u2019t quite understand everything, of course, but she does ask for extra things now and more accepts when I say the funds aren\u2019t there. \n\nLetting children understand that there are certain parameters to why the parents have to sometimes say \u201cno\u201d is necessary in a lot of circumstances.", "I disagree - they are 14 and 16, not 4 and 6. Yes, they are young, but old enough to be explained that their mum is not simply making them share a room because she wants to.", "you really want to call them assholes?? these are two kids who lost their dad a couple months ago and have had their whole world turned upside down since. they're all adjusting and grieving and trying to figure stuff out.", "Parentification isn't right. They didn't choose to have another baby, you did.", "My family went through a lot when I was a teenager. Without animosity towards these kids, in some ways, they are behaving selfishly. I can understand the circumstance while still thinking they can do better.", "I think sitting down with the kids and explaining the down & dirty of financial reality is called for in this instance. They are old enough to understand. I make X amount of money, I need to pay rent, utilities, transportation, food (with help from pantry when I can get it). There's nothing left. \n\nThen ask - What can we do to get this to work for our family? Maybe they'll brainstorm and come up with ideas or offers to supplement your income? I would tend to put son in LR and girls in the bedroom - not great, but maybe the kids have different ideas on what is best.", "If OP isn't telling them the situation, they're not magically going to understand. Teenagers are perfectly capable of understanding poverty - being lied to doesn't make them better at empathy. OP is not being an AH by trying to make light of it, but they're going to be brats if they don't understand that this is by necessity.", "That person is a teacher, yikes, wonder how many marriages they're breaking up in their classroom encouraging kids to hate their parents", "No, but the library would offer resources available to help her get food and finances, which I provided as advice. \n\nDo you struggle with reading comprehension?", "You've clearly never had to sit with a 15 year old crying and threatening to kill themselves because at least if he was gone, his little brother would have enough food.", "It is possible, but in my 15 year experience, it doesn't get struck often.  I got out of the school system because I couldn't take it anymore.  Watching kids, literal kids, trying to balance school and adult problems, is heart breaking. They don't understand.  They bring their stuff to school to sell.  They save their lunches so they can take food home to the youngers. Some of them resort to stealing.  It's horrible.  \n\nThis is how the poor cycle continues.  Many have to get crap jobs to help the family and just stay on that track.   Studies suffer because they're stuck watching babies overnight and don't get enough sleep to focus and end up with bad grades and no hopes of college. \n\nMom has other agencies she hasn't tried.  She's admitted to being ashamed of using the food bank.  I say she swallows her pride and reaches out to the help she can get from her local services before burdening her children with this. They're already grieving their father, as so many have pointed out.", "You're absolutely correct.  14 and 16. This is a turning point in their lives.  College could be just around the corner.  Or a decent trade job.  But you can't earn scholarships if you're too tired from watching a 2 year old all night.  Or losing sleep because you're up all night worrying about how to solve adult problems.  Can't land a decent job if you're stuck in  fast food supporting siblings.  \n\nIt's OK, though.  As one commenter pointed out, she grew up poor and knew the details and turned out fine. Just ask her therapist. \ud83d\ude43", "And they can't figure out that their mom is struggling to stay afloat and needs help? Yeah, they're assholes. They're not 6 and 4, they're 16 and 14. They're being willfully obtuse. Not like OP didn't lose someone, too.", "nah exists", "My aunt died while waiting for it. And it took nearly 8 years for my mom to have a place, she was living with her elderly parents for that entire time", "Not healthy =/= abuse", "Where did I say any that? Read again. I was speaking of conditions to be met before placing a new child into existing home. Maybe choose your words more carefully next time before heavily implying that a widow is abusing her children because she can\u2019t afford more than they have.", "What finances? With two jobs OP is definitely over income for TANF", "I was mocking your post due to your ignorant and stupid comment, which I see you have now edited out, about a court seeing the current arrangements as \"abusive\". A pretty terrible thing to say to this struggling parent. Perhaps you should stick to the good work you do at your library rather than pretending to know how family courts think.", "That's an extreme example and will not apply to every situation. I grew up in poverty and my mother parentified me - I shared the household burden in an adult way that was inappropriate. Countless people share my situation. As an adult I am in therapy to help me deal with the lifelong fallout from this. Many of my friends grew up in the same situation. Not once did any of us react in this way.\n\nIs it okay for OP to force their teenagers to be equal contributing parent figures in the household? Absolutely not. Is it appropriate to share with them, that their family is struggling right now and explain the situation in an age appropriate manner? Absolutely.", "You're either willfully misconstruing what I said or you plain misunderstood me. What I said was, there's a right way and a wrong way to explain to the kids what's happening. What happened to me was the wrong way (making the burden of the parents also the burden of the children). Hence being in therapy to deal with my own situation. However there are lots of people who grew up in similar situations as myself and did not end up with the same issues, because their parents explained their situation without shifting the burden to their kids.", "OP is not making them help with childcare. Or passing the problem onto them. But at this age they need to understand that mum cannot afford certain things. You can't coddle them forever.", "i agree with this! i bet op hasnt had time to fully grieve either.", "Sure, in most situations, in privileged parts of the world. But this is different. Their dad died. Their mom is starving herself. Successful adults have compassion for others and are willing to help out those they love when a difficult situation arises.", "You\u2019re a sad person. Your outlook is shitty. NTA", "[deleted]", "Not correct, misinformation. Everything is situational based on when children are involved. Also, food drives don't require proof of income, they're built on a trust system. Food alone would help with finances.\n\nAgain, I've literally done this for 10 years. I know what I'm talking about.", "You said, and I quote, \u201cthis situation would be considered abusive.\u201d That is a loaded word, and I suspect you know that since you went back and edited it out.", "Lmfao TANF is absolutely not situational. It has real income guidelines, and you can only get TANF with kids. Food isn't rent money. Do you know specifics of these benefits, or do you just help people get on 211 or Find Help?", "Weird, because I did not meet any of these and still got a college degree  as of a couple years ago and have a career.\n\nYou can recognize it sucks to have to babysit and also not be obtuse about the fact that sometimes life circumstances make it necessary. Have you EVER been poor?", "She said she's not in the US, so extracurriculars, AP classes and volunteer work won't be the remotest consideration to a university.", "Lol since when did you need only straight A\u2019s to get into uni? What planet are you living on right now?\n\nThey\u2019ll just have to make do with what they have and adapt to it, like the rest of us. That\u2019s life, mate. We can\u2019t have everything, especially when the breadwinner dies unexpectedly, leaving behind 3 children and a SAHM (presumably? If she was working I\u2019ll redact this part when I find it or is pointed out to me), who is sacrificing two days of food so that the kids don\u2019t go without. You picked a really shit hill to die on\u2026\n\nActually sounds a lot like my mum, except I never met my dad, she just had me super young. I was a benefits baby for a very long time. You know what I ended up doing? I got my first job at 15 years old. I didn\u2019t cry about a scholarship or my A\u2019s (which I was never going to get anyway) I just cracked on with it and hoped for the best. It\u2019s definitely not an ideal situation for someone that age, but for me personally, it kept me out of trouble (fell into a bad crowd) and made me more responsible. I don\u2019t regret it, and I tell ya what - my mum appreciated it, and I came to appreciate her sacrifices more.\n\nWith all that said, it\u2019s very easy to weed out people who have never seen the breadline\u2026 people like you are the reason we still have things like food banks in the first world. You are  so wildly out of touch with reality\u2026", "What I mean, is that there are other things besides TANF.\nMany states have their own unique programs, as well as things like food stamps, hud etc. The rules and guidelines for many programs differ. \n\nOf course food isn't rent money. But less money spent on food is more money spent on rent or other necessities, that should be a no Brainer. \n\nI wouldn't know the specifics of anything outside of my specific state, but librarians in her state would know how to push her in the right direction. \n\nWe don't file anything on their behalf, we have resources and community events. I've run a food drive at my library twice a year every year so far.", "My daughter had maybe a 3.0 weighted in high school. She got into not only state schools but private schools as well.

There are 4500 - a place for everyone.", "And honestly, in the US there are state universities with less stringent requirements. You won\u2019t get to rub shoulders with the elite, but you\u2019ll get an education.", "OP is not in the US so none of this applies to her situation.", "HUD is the department not the benefit or service. It can take 2-5 years to get a section 8/housing choice voucher, but some people have been waiting a decade.
