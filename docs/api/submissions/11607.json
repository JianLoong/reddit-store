I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Your kids are going to have to understand that this situation is not ideal for any of you and you are all trying to adjust. Teens don\u2019t have all of the insight of an adult, but your kids are old enough to understand what\u2019s going on. You may have to be completely honest with them about how poor the situation really is (not being able to feed everyone). If they truly want to help change things, they can offer to babysit while you get another job or could even try working a few hours, but, for now, they will have to accept that this is how life is and that you are doing everything you can to just provide for their basic needs.", "NAH I\u2019m so sorry about your situation.

Are your kids aware of how bad your financial situation is? Maybe sit them down and spell things out to them. They're teenagers, they can take it, and hopefully it will help them understand that you have no option for now. I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA. I am so sorry for your loss. I can\u2019t imagine how devastating that must be. And you are clearly doing your best and you have tried to make things as comfortable for your kids while taking on a lot more stress yourself.

You need to be honest with your oldest children, ask them for input.  Unfortunately they need to set up & help hold the family together.\nMaybe you could share the bedroom with both the daughters & let your son sleep in the living room.", "NTA. Im so sorry you are going through this. Assuming you are UK (cause food bank) have you looked into benefits? Or a council house? Can talk to citizens advice?", "NTA, and I feel like your teen kids are being too harsh. They\u2019re refusing to look after the baby just because it\u2019s not their responsibility? Throughout my 19 years of existence, I\u2019ve had to babysit my little siblings\u2026 like A LOT. They may be annoyed by this, but if I were you as the parent, I\u2019d make it their responsibility to look after the baby so you can perhaps work more. As for the rooms, try to tell them nicely that you\u2019re doing your absolute best, but this is all you\u2019re able to afford right now.\n\nOne last thing, I\u2019m very sorry for the loss of your husband. Sending you all the love! \ud83d\udc95", "I'd say NAH. I'm very sorry for your loss, and it sounds like your kids are trying to cling to a sense of normalcy during a time of very intense grieving amd change. That being said, it's understandable that you can't provide the same lifestyle they were accustomed to previously. There's no shame in using the food bank, and you're doing what you can to keep them fed and safe. I hope you're able to do the same for yourself soon too, and that in the future they're able to look back and recognize the sacrifices that you made for them.", "NTA but equally your children are NTA for complaining about their living situation. Sounds like a horrible circumstance overall.\n\nFWIW in UK law a house/flat is considered overcrowded if two people (including siblings) aged over 10 years old and of the opposite gender have to share a room. \n\nIf a family home is overcrowded then you would be technically considered homeless and able to apply for social housing. \n\nI assume its different in the US, but worth noting that as a short term solution its probably fine but if its a long term solution then it may affect the health/wellbeing of your children. \n\nI don't know if there is some social/local authority support in your area?", "Info so you have any family (his or yours) that can help you? Grandparents that can watch the little one? \n\nSo sorry for your loss. I don't think I'd want a two year old being watched by kids that don't want that responsibility though... \n\nNTA but have your son sleep in the living room.", "I'm so sorry you're in this position. NAH you're all grieving and probably in shock. Please (gently) tell your teenagers about the food bank, for a few reasons. First, if they know they may be more willing to help out with the 2yo and free up a bit more of your time. Second, it's not at all fair they they are having to grow up so fast, but keeping the full situation from them won't be good in the long run (or good for you! You need support too!) Finally - they deserve to know. They may be thinking all sorts of untrue and upsetting things in their grief, and being all on the same page really does make communication and compromise easier. It's the only way we really can compromise, and compromise is what you're (justifiably) asking of them. \n\nAlso, there's absolutely no shame in using food banks. They're there to be used. You're in a really difficult spot at the moment and your resilience in dealing with everything and using every resource at your disposal is impressive, not shameful <3", "NTA, but I think you should be honest with them. They\u2019re old enough to understand your family\u2019s financial hardship, and you\u2019re doing your best. They might also be having a difficult time coping with change though, counseling (maybe through a non-profit or some kind of sliding scale payment) might benefit everyone.", "NTA\n\nhope things will get better in the future. Kts nkt your fault this problem happend and rather having a room then none at all is what i think.", "NTA \n\nUnless there\u2019s a spare room your using to store your stamp collection. Your doing the best you can. Gotta work with what your got and hopefully they understand that", "I'm sorry you're going through this. This is the best solution though. Please do not make your oldest daughter share a room with a toddler though because they have the same genitals. That's unfair to her and will distract her much more so than the two older kids sharing a room. I'm upset that you immediately suggested your daughter take that responsibility on and not your son, even though he's older.... at the very least make them trade off. Jesus.", "NAH.\n\nYou're doing the best you can and trying to improve your situation as well as the situation for your kids.\n\nI do understand where your teenagers are coming from regarding caring for your daughter (although I wish they would help out just out of kindness) and about sharing a room.\n\nPerhaps you should tell your kids that if they want their own separate bedrooms the only way you can afford it is if they help out after daycare hours so that you can work a second job. They can make their choice from there.\n\nOverall just an unfortunate situation all around. I'm sorry that you and your family are going through this and hope the best for you all going forward.", "I hate to say it, but the asshole here is the late husband who didn't get a good life insurance policy so his family wouldn't be in this situation if he passed.", "NTA\nI am sorry for your loss and your situation. :( So I assume you life in the US? Is there any financial support by the state for mothers with 3 kids?", "I really want to say N A H here, but this is something you and your husband should have discussed before you ever got pregnant with your first kid. If you didn\u2019t have the means to provide a suitable living space for all your children, then you needed to not keep having children. It\u2019s not their fault and male and female teenagers need private space. \n\nI get that you\u2019re in a tough situation and maybe most of the fault goes to your husband on that. Maybe not. But you did have a responsibility that you\u2019re now failing at. \n\nHave you considered that part of why they don\u2019t want to help with childcare for the toddler is they know they need scholarships for college in order to not be saddled with thousands of dollars of students loans? They may have other plans for their future because it know that things aren\u2019t financially stable right now and if so, good for them. \n\nSo, soft YTA.", "NTA.\n\nIts a pity you raised your kids so poorly they arent even willing to take care of their younger sibling or share a room.

Get them involved and helpful. Go for the free family dinners. Find other things that will give away food. Have them check at their school for resources.

They\u2019re not even equivalent. It\u2019s not ideal, but the situation is what it is. Refusing to babysit so OP can work more AND complaining that they want their own space is not ok.
