My husband unexpectedly passed away a few months ago, and I became a single mother to 3 kids. Age 16M, 14F and 2F. Due to the significant decrease of income, I was no longer able to continue renting where we were, and I all I can afford is a 1 bedroom apartment.\n\nCurrently, I am sleeping in the living room with my youngest 2F. I gave the bedroom to my 16M and 14F and asked them to share in the meanwhile. I tried adding a privacy screen in the middle so they feel like they have their own space, but they are telling me that this isn't acceptable. Each of my kids used to have their own rooms, so this is a massive change for them.\n\nI have been looking for a better paying job for months and so far have had no luck. I can't get a 2nd job because I can't afford to pay someone to care for my daughter 2F outside daycare hours. Neither of my kids 16M and 14F are willing to help, and they say my youngest is not their responsibility.\n\nI know this situation isn't ideal, but I don't know what else I can do. For the past month, I've not been eating anything for 2 days a week and just telling the kids I'm trying out the fasting trend for weight loss purposes. But the truth is, I can't afford to feed us all, and I have been using the food bank. Prior to this, I had never had to use food bank services before, and I am so thankful that it exists. I am both thankful and deeply ashamed at the same time.\n\nWould I be the AH for telling my teens that they must share the bedroom? Would it be better if I suggested my son sleep in the living room with me and have both my female kids share the bedroom instead?\n\nI do not live in the US but it is not common for teenagers of opposite sex to share a bedroom. That is something I do absolutely recognize.\n\nEdit: Gosh, I really wasn't expecting so many responses when I checked back. Thank you, everyone. All this time, I did feel it would be unfair to put adult problems on my kids. However, I will be giving them a surface level talk about our finances. I'll also be bringing them with me to the food bank. Hopefully, they'll be more understanding.\n\nEdit 2: The bedroom is larger than the living room. I am able to fit 2 single beds into the bedroom and the kids have space to store their clothes while still having the room divider in the middle. The living room is smaller. I currently have my youngest and my own clothes stored in the hallway due to lack of space. It is right next to the washroom and kitchen, so there is a lot of foot traffic. The living room also doubles as dining space because there is no dining room.", "created_utc": 1678083891, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jqodr/aita_for_making_my_teens_16m_and_14f_share_a/", "score": 5518, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Teens don\u2019t have all of the insight of an adult, but your kids are old enough to understand what\u2019s going on. You may have to be completely honest with them about how poor the situation really is (not being able to feed everyone). If they truly want to help change things, they can offer to babysit while you get another job or could even try working a few hours, but, for now, they will have to accept that this is how life is and that you are doing everything you can to just provide for their basic needs.", "NAH I\u2019m so sorry about your situation.

Im so sorry you are going through this. Assuming you are UK (cause food bank) have you looked into benefits? Or a council house? Can talk to citizens advice?", "NTA, and I feel like your teen kids are being too harsh. They\u2019re refusing to look after the baby just because it\u2019s not their responsibility? Throughout my 19 years of existence, I\u2019ve had to babysit my little siblings\u2026 like A LOT. They may be annoyed by this, but if I were you as the parent, I\u2019d make it their responsibility to look after the baby so you can perhaps work more.

There's no shame in using the food bank, and you're doing what you can to keep them fed and safe. I hope you're able to do the same for yourself soon too, and that in the future they're able to look back and recognize the sacrifices that you made for them.", "NTA but equally your children are NTA for complaining about their living situation. Sounds like a horrible circumstance overall.\n\nFWIW in UK law a house/flat is considered overcrowded if two people (including siblings) aged over 10 years old and of the opposite gender have to share a room. \n\nIf a family home is overcrowded then you would be technically considered homeless and able to apply for social housing. \n\nI assume its different in the US, but worth noting that as a short term solution its probably fine but if its a long term solution then it may affect the health/wellbeing of your children. \n\nI don't know if there is some social/local authority support in your area?", "Info so you have any family (his or yours) that can help you? Grandparents that can watch the little one? \n\nSo sorry for your loss. I don't think I'd want a two year old being watched by kids that don't want that responsibility though... \n\nNTA but have your son sleep in the living room.", "I'm so sorry you're in this position. NAH you're all grieving and probably in shock. Please (gently) tell your teenagers about the food bank, for a few reasons. First, if they know they may be more willing to help out with the 2yo and free up a bit more of your time. Second, it's not at all fair they they are having to grow up so fast, but keeping the full situation from them won't be good in the long run (or good for you! You need support too!) Finally - they deserve to know. They may be thinking all sorts of untrue and upsetting things in their grief, and being all on the same page really does make communication and compromise easier. It's the only way we really can compromise, and compromise is what you're (justifiably) asking of them. \n\nAlso, there's absolutely no shame in using food banks. They're there to be used. You're in a really difficult spot at the moment and your resilience in dealing with everything and using every resource at your disposal is impressive, not shameful <3", "NTA, but I think you should be honest with them. They\u2019re old enough to understand your family\u2019s financial hardship, and you\u2019re doing your best. They might also be having a difficult time coping with change though, counseling (maybe through a non-profit or some kind of sliding scale payment) might benefit everyone.", "NTA\n\nhope things will get better in the future. Kts nkt your fault this problem happend and rather having a room then none at all is what i think.", "NTA \n\nUnless there\u2019s a spare room your using to store your stamp collection. Your doing the best you can. Gotta work with what your got and hopefully they understand that", "I'm sorry you're going through this. This is the best solution though. Please do not make your oldest daughter share a room with a toddler though because they have the same genitals. That's unfair to her and will distract her much more so than the two older kids sharing a room. I'm upset that you immediately suggested your daughter take that responsibility on and not your son, even though he's older.... at the very least make them trade off. Jesus.", "NAH.\n\nYou're doing the best you can and trying to improve your situation as well as the situation for your kids.\n\nI do understand where your teenagers are coming from regarding caring for your daughter (although I wish they would help out just out of kindness) and about sharing a room.\n\nPerhaps you should tell your kids that if they want their own separate bedrooms the only way you can afford it is if they help out after daycare hours so that you can work a second job. They can make their choice from there.\n\nOverall just an unfortunate situation all around. I'm sorry that you and your family are going through this and hope the best for you all going forward.", "I hate to say it, but the asshole here is the late husband who didn't get a good life insurance policy so his family wouldn't be in this situation if he passed.", "NTA\nI am sorry for your loss and your situation. :( So I assume you life in the US? Is there any financial support by the state for mothers with 3 kids?", "I really want to say N A H here, but this is something you and your husband should have discussed before you ever got pregnant with your first kid. If you didn\u2019t have the means to provide a suitable living space for all your children, then you needed to not keep having children. It\u2019s not their fault and male and female teenagers need private space. \n\nI get that you\u2019re in a tough situation and maybe most of the fault goes to your husband on that. Maybe not. But you did have a responsibility that you\u2019re now failing at. \n\nHave you considered that part of why they don\u2019t want to help with childcare for the toddler is they know they need scholarships for college in order to not be saddled with thousands of dollars of students loans? They may have other plans for their future because it know that things aren\u2019t financially stable right now and if so, good for them. \n\nSo, soft YTA.", "NTA.\n\nIts a pity you raised your kids so poorly they arent even willing to take care of their younger sibling or share a room.

They should know the real situation and not think you're doing this on purpose.  The reason I say that is that they can transfer their grief and resentment to you in this current scenario, and that would just be such a sad coda to this tale.\n\nI hope you can find your footing and make your way better.  I'm sorry you feel shame for using a support that is meant to help you.  There is no shame in taking aid that you need.

You can't magically make more bedrooms appear. You lost your husband, and they lost their dad. Everyone is going to be emotionally out of sorts. Kids tend to hate sharing rooms already but they're also probably in shitty emotional states and they're probably going to be inclined to lash out a little harder about this, even if they do logically get that you can't afford a bigger place. That doesn't make it better for you to deal with, but I really doubt they're just coming from a place of cruelty.\n\nI do think you should be honest with them about your financial situation and take them to the food bank with you. Hiding the reality will just reinforce any sense of injustice they feel, and telling them you're starving yourself for weight loss is not exactly a healthy thing for a kid to learn, either. You deserve to eat food too, and they will learn to empathize with you if they know what's actually happening. There's nothing shameful about needing social services. They exist to be used. You're a person in need, you get to use them.\n\nI don't know what housing assistance is like outside the US but here we have some programs for housing vouchers/low income housing.

Teenagers are developmentally ready to assist others with kindness and to watch after a young child for limited periods of time. They are *exactly* developmentally ready to shoulder some part of the responsibilities they will have in adulthood. How are they to act and react when they move in with a roommate?

They don't need to throw that away when mom could reach out and get qualified help.  Plenty of commenters have given links for such agencies. \n\nI don't understand how not a single person doesn't understand the problems this causes.  Teen suicide isn't a big deal?

Because for me, just one kid killing themselves over this nonsense is too many.  \n\nI keep seeing \"right way and wrong way,\" but who are you to know if you've done it the right way? You don't know what the kid is thinking.  They're not going to tell YOU because they don't want to add to the burden. Some may never tell anyone.  They'll just let it eat them.  I've watched great kids die slow deaths inside because they've internalized these problems.  I've seen excellent students drop to failing students because they can't stay awake during class. I've seen kids turn down scholarships because going away to college means they have to give up their part time income and will no longer be able to help support the family. \n\nThe bottom line is that it's our job to provide for our children.

I'm now judgy of you, because you keep telling me that it's part of life for kids to feel this way.  It's not.  People seem to minimalize the amount of problems kids already have.

Because just because you're young, it doesn't mean you have zero coping skills. That, yes, maybe it makes sense when a whole family is in a bad situation to ask them to do a little bit extra to help keep both the family and themselves out a far worse situation. Such as, probably some light babysitting is not too much to ask, no.\n\nBut no, you're too intent on infantalizing them all to think rationally about it.

The world always was and always will be competitive, no matter how well you plan for it\u2026", ">there's a good chance you'll get a better response from them if you include them in your decision making that affects them.\n\nAgreed.\n\nThey are old enough to know what's going on, and they are old enough to be able to make appropriate decisions accordingly.  They might be more willing to help out with the 2 year old if they understand what's happening, for example.  Please don't try to hide what's going on.", "Seconding this. My local buy nothing groups are very active, and show up with food and other items for people in need. Wonderful community.", "Exactly. I\u2019m well into my 20s and it\u2019s just now registering how tight my family\u2019s finances were at times. It was never dire-we always had food on the table and lights on. But we lived in an affluent area and definitely couldn\u2019t afford the same things as our friends. But my parents really weren\u2019t up front about it-so as a kid I interpreted it as \u201cwe\u2019re mean parents who don\u2019t want to pay for this expensive activity\u201d not \u201cwe literally don\u2019t have the money for this\u201d. I still have a lot of bitterness over that that I think could\u2019ve been avoided if I\u2019d been part of the money conversation a bit more.", "Exactly. I knew money was tight a lot as a kid. But, for example, I didn't make the connection that my mom wasn't doing The Cabbage Soup Diet occasionally strictly for weightloss until I was in my mid twenties.", "Yes, the problem is that they are not being ushered effectively into adulthood. Kids need to know about reality and cannot mature when adults hide important stuff like this from them. How can they understand when the adult they rely on won\u2019t clue them in?", "Kids aren\u2019t all the same.  Circumstances and life-experiences can be quite different, even when the surface level-stuff looks the same. Your ability to be very mature at 8 being thrust into poverty doesn\u2019t mean 2 teens will be able to FULLY understand and immediately adjust to their drastically changed lives following trauma. These kids also got used to living a certain way for twice as long as you were even alive at 8, so perhaps having to change may be a different kind of challenge for them, plus they\u2019ve got the hormone-filled teen brains on top of everything. Younger kids are self-centered, but 14-16-year-old kids are notoriously difficult, self-centered and impulsive in their own right. It sounds like you handled yourself marvelously in a terribly challenging situation, but not everyone is so resilient."]}
