I'm so sorry for your loss.", "NTA. Your kids are going to have to understand that this situation is not ideal for any of you and you are all trying to adjust. Teens don\u2019t have all of the insight of an adult, but your kids are old enough to understand what\u2019s going on. You may have to be completely honest with them about how poor the situation really is (not being able to feed everyone). If they truly want to help change things, they can offer to babysit while you get another job or could even try working a few hours, but, for now, they will have to accept that this is how life is and that you are doing everything you can to just provide for their basic needs.", "NAH I\u2019m so sorry about your situation.

Im so sorry you are going through this. Assuming you are UK (cause food bank) have you looked into benefits? Or a council house? Can talk to citizens advice?", "NTA, and I feel like your teen kids are being too harsh. They\u2019re refusing to look after the baby just because it\u2019s not their responsibility? Throughout my 19 years of existence, I\u2019ve had to babysit my little siblings\u2026 like A LOT. They may be annoyed by this, but if I were you as the parent, I\u2019d make it their responsibility to look after the baby so you can perhaps work more.

There's no shame in using the food bank, and you're doing what you can to keep them fed and safe. I hope you're able to do the same for yourself soon too, and that in the future they're able to look back and recognize the sacrifices that you made for them.", "NTA but equally your children are NTA for complaining about their living situation. Sounds like a horrible circumstance overall.\n\nFWIW in UK law a house/flat is considered overcrowded if two people (including siblings) aged over 10 years old and of the opposite gender have to share a room. \n\nIf a family home is overcrowded then you would be technically considered homeless and able to apply for social housing. \n\nI assume its different in the US, but worth noting that as a short term solution its probably fine but if its a long term solution then it may affect the health/wellbeing of your children. \n\nI don't know if there is some social/local authority support in your area?", "Info so you have any family (his or yours) that can help you? Grandparents that can watch the little one? \n\nSo sorry for your loss. I don't think I'd want a two year old being watched by kids that don't want that responsibility though... \n\nNTA but have your son sleep in the living room.", "I'm so sorry you're in this position. NAH you're all grieving and probably in shock. Please (gently) tell your teenagers about the food bank, for a few reasons. First, if they know they may be more willing to help out with the 2yo and free up a bit more of your time. Second, it's not at all fair they they are having to grow up so fast, but keeping the full situation from them won't be good in the long run (or good for you! You need support too!) Finally - they deserve to know. They may be thinking all sorts of untrue and upsetting things in their grief, and being all on the same page really does make communication and compromise easier. It's the only way we really can compromise, and compromise is what you're (justifiably) asking of them. \n\nAlso, there's absolutely no shame in using food banks. They're there to be used. You're in a really difficult spot at the moment and your resilience in dealing with everything and using every resource at your disposal is impressive, not shameful <3", "NTA, but I think you should be honest with them. They\u2019re old enough to understand your family\u2019s financial hardship, and you\u2019re doing your best. They might also be having a difficult time coping with change though, counseling (maybe through a non-profit or some kind of sliding scale payment) might benefit everyone.", "NTA\n\nhope things will get better in the future. Kts nkt your fault this problem happend and rather having a room then none at all is what i think.", "NTA \n\nUnless there\u2019s a spare room your using to store your stamp collection. Your doing the best you can. Gotta work with what your got and hopefully they understand that", "I'm sorry you're going through this. This is the best solution though. Please do not make your oldest daughter share a room with a toddler though because they have the same genitals. That's unfair to her and will distract her much more so than the two older kids sharing a room. I'm upset that you immediately suggested your daughter take that responsibility on and not your son, even though he's older.... at the very least make them trade off. Jesus.", "NAH.\n\nYou're doing the best you can and trying to improve your situation as well as the situation for your kids.\n\nI do understand where your teenagers are coming from regarding caring for your daughter (although I wish they would help out just out of kindness) and about sharing a room.\n\nPerhaps you should tell your kids that if they want their own separate bedrooms the only way you can afford it is if they help out after daycare hours so that you can work a second job. They can make their choice from there.\n\nOverall just an unfortunate situation all around. I'm sorry that you and your family are going through this and hope the best for you all going forward.", "I hate to say it, but the asshole here is the late husband who didn't get a good life insurance policy so his family wouldn't be in this situation if he passed.", "NTA\nI am sorry for your loss and your situation. :( So I assume you life in the US? Is there any financial support by the state for mothers with 3 kids?", "I really want to say N A H here, but this is something you and your husband should have discussed before you ever got pregnant with your first kid. If you didn\u2019t have the means to provide a suitable living space for all your children, then you needed to not keep having children. It\u2019s not their fault and male and female teenagers need private space. \n\nI get that you\u2019re in a tough situation and maybe most of the fault goes to your husband on that. Maybe not. But you did have a responsibility that you\u2019re now failing at. \n\nHave you considered that part of why they don\u2019t want to help with childcare for the toddler is they know they need scholarships for college in order to not be saddled with thousands of dollars of students loans? They may have other plans for their future because it know that things aren\u2019t financially stable right now and if so, good for them. \n\nSo, soft YTA.", "NTA.\n\nIts a pity you raised your kids so poorly they arent even willing to take care of their younger sibling or share a room.

There are loads of really cheap budget meals you can make that will feed you all.", "Nta but you need to tell the kids what\u2019s really going on", "NAH. This is a really unfortunate situation, and I'm sorry for your loss. You may well be eligible for social housing, and given the ages of your teenage kids, as well as having a 2yo, you would potentially be a priority. Have a look online to see what benefits you may also be entitled to. Finally, I know you don't want to burden your kids, but they need to know the situation. You need to be able to be there for them, and that includes not knocking yourself out or starving yourself to make sure they don't go without.", "nta. I'm sorry for your loss. I'm in q similar situayou are. I was finally able to make it to where my 3 oldest have their own rooms but I sleep in the living room on the floor so my youngest 2 have somewhere to sleep. I don't have anyone willing to watch my kids so I can work. my oldest is 15 but I don't feel right asking her to babysit. I had to give up my childhood pretty much to watch my brother's so my.mom could work or run off with her many boyfriends. I won't do that to my daughter. watching he rb able to actually be a kid something I didn't get to have is amazing.", "NTA\n\nYou do your best. Your children are really spoiled and it sucks they can't understand what happen.\n\nSorry for you, it will get better", "NAH you really need to explain the situation fully to them. I\u2019m sorry for your loss and pray things get better.", "NTA\n\nYou've got hard times and you have to do what you have to do. Just check the laws where you're at.

Remember that they have also just been through a lot.", "NTA. Your kids need to understand what your financial situation is first. They would probably be terrified to learn just how bad it is, and they're already under a lot of stress, but they should understand that you cannot afford a bigger apartment right now.\n\nThen, ask them what THEY think you should do about the bedroom situation and discuss it together. Now that your husband is gone, you and your kids are a team against the rest of the world. You have to stick together and help each other. **You can make it if you can work together.** They must realize this, and you must lead the way.\n\nDiscuss the various options about who should sleep where. Your kids might have some good ideas you haven't even thought about yet. Then you decide, as a team, what to do. *About everything.*\n\nThe hardships will be a lot easier for them to accept when they are part of the decision-making process. It will make their world feel a little less out of control.", "Nta. You are in a rough spot. Are you American? I assume your husband worked. If he did and payed into social security ypu would be entitled to survivor benefits for your kinds until they both turn 18 and graduate high school.

This is not an idea situation, but it sounds like this is an emergency and you're doing what you have to to keep a roof over everyone's head. Sometimes you have to do what you have to do. \n\nI get why you want to shield them from the details of your hardship, but that might actually be counterproductive here. They're old enough to know things are this way because it's a \"need\" and not a \"want\" and if they know that, they may be more understanding of the situation.", "NTA, I understand your children are grieving, but YIKES. They really need to either help with 2F or get part time jobs.", "NAH, other than what others have mentioned about babysitting, telling them the truth about finances, or getting jobs themselves I would sit them down and ask for help in other areas as well. Ask them to look online for cheap recipes that they think they'd like to try. Give them a challenge of making a meal plan with $50 for the week as an example. Ask them to help you look for a cheap 2 bedroom apartment. Ask them to help you check local job ads so you can apply to them. Phrase it as on top of helping you get back on your feet, it is also good experience for them to \"practice\" these things for when they're adults and will give them a leg up when all of a sudden they need to do this for themselves.", "You need to apply for any and all benefits you can. In a lot of places it's not legal housing to have 2 teens of opposite genders share a room. So Nah, but you really need to apply for housing and food/welfare benefits.", "Hey mum, you're NTA. I'm sorry for your loss. You are strong. You are amazing. Please don't be afraid to ask for help. Find the people, friends, and family members you trust the most.

OP herself don't have a room and has to use a living room with their youngest siblings, are they unable to see it or to understand it ?  I would understand it they were 8 and 7, but they have no excuse at this age. \n\nYTA because you let yours kids to grown at this age without understanding that money don't grow in trees.", "This. They're old enough to understand, and likely will be helped by knowing what's going on and why.\n\nYou can't shield them from this, but there's a good chance you'll get a better response from them if you include them in your decision making that affects them. \n\nHope better things come your way soon.

They should know and it might be time for them to step up and help you.\n\nI hope things will be sorted out and please remember that if you don't feed yourself you will be sick. If you are sick you cannot attend work or help your children, mostly your youngest daughter.", "Agree, and I would even go so far as to say she needs to not hide this from them. They are old enough to be let in on the situation and it might even get them to offer solutions themselves.", "Financial struggle or not, a 1 bedroom apartment with 3 kids and 1 adult is just not healthy. I get it, her husband passed and that absolutely sucks, and I wish her the best. \n\nNo judgement, but this is absolutely not okay long term, resources are available and I suggest op checks her local library for more information.", "I don\u2019t think I\u2019m comfortable with 2 minors who just lost their father, their family home and their privacy in a short period of time being called assholes. Deeply unrealistic and in desperate need of a reality check, but assholes? They\u2019re kids who have suffered a LOT of loss and change. It also sounds like there could be some resentment towards the two year old - maybe that\u2019s only since their dad died but maybe that\u2019s an issue that was allowed to fester for a couple of years before that. \n\nIf there\u2019s no money for food, there\u2019s likely no money for therapy to help them process what\u2019s happening around them. Honestly, maybe the best thing OP can do is clue them in on the family situation a bit. Let them know just how hard life is and give them the opportunity to develop a more mature perspective. If there\u2019s anything in anyone\u2019s soul, learning mom isn\u2019t eating two days a week to feed them should be a wake up call.", "As a child welfare worker we 100% would not take the kids away for this and call the mom a child abuser. We would instead work to get them all their own beds and help convert the one bedroom into two bedrooms via privacy screens and movable walls. In fact this would only be considered a major problem at least in my state is if the mom tries to get a fostering license.", "Are you aware that human beings have lived with entire families in single-room dwellings for much of our history? Geez, Reddit is so quick to shit on people for the dumbest reasons.\n\nI can only assume you\u2019re thinking of foster/adoption requirements and conflating that in your mind to what is normal for everyone, everywhere. It isn\u2019t. Those are special situations that require guidelines before placing an additional kid (quite often from a traumatic background) in a home. You\u2019re not abusive because you\u2019re poor due to a spouse\u2019s death.", "Great idea! While generally libraries don't like it when people try to stay overnight, the OP could send the older kids to a university library where they could probably get away with sleeping at a desk.", "\"Asshole\" is an AITA convention - it doesn't actually necessarily mean that the people are *assholes*, just that they're in the wrong in this situation.\n\nAnd they are in the wrong. Even grieving, and even without knowing for certain how much their mom is struggling, they cannot possibly think that she's moved them into a one-bed apartment and doesn't have a bed of her own because it's her dream to live that way.", "Their dad fucking died and their mom needs help. This isn\u2019t a parentification situation. This is a we all need to band together issue.", "This argument works when the parents have the luxury of choice.

I wish things could be better for Op and her kids.", "I never said the children would be taken away. Yes, you would work with the children on improving the situation, because you agree it is not healthy. \n\nHence the comment where I suggested they check with their library for available resources.", "If you think that a 14 and 16 year old losing their father, having to share a bedroom for a month, likely struggling with food, and being told to get jobs to help support the family all in the span of a couple months won't cause trauma or need therapy, you're kidding yourself. \n\nAlso, I never shit on the OP. I expressed empathy for her situation, I never called her an asshole, and gave resources to possibly help improve her situation.", "I have volunteered at my local library for 10 years. \n\nAs a government branch, the library has access to many different kinds of assistance programs. Libraries are designated \"safe spaces\" meaning staff are trained to react in multiple different situations, including abusive partners or parents.  Many food drives also take place in libraries which would assist financially. \n\nNot only are libraries excellent sources to help with assistance, librarians actually log hours spent helping patrons with things like creating resumes, helping with homework, filing taxes etc. \n\nYour ignorance on how libraries work and can assist is no reason to leave a sarcastic reply.
