They pick it up off your porch for you!!", "Very true.  It wouldn't take THAT long to look through 5 bags.  It's not like there is biological waste in the bags! It's just clothing. Instead, he threw up his hands and said \"sorry! I can't be bothered!\"", "They had been living in that room/home before.", "I mean the jacket could be sentimental and thats why she doesn't wear it often, or it could be for specific weather and doesn't get worn often. I have a few jackets like that in my house, one thats a combo of the above is my letterman jacket, because A) it doesn't make sense to wear it so often and B) its really good in extreme snow, which we don't get often where I live", "my skinny little bf wears the same size as me and i still steal his hoodies and t shirts \ud83e\udd23 theyre comfy and smell like him, even if theyre not baggy", "Honestly, he knew she was joking and could have set the jacket aside until he got a straight answer from her, but he didn't. Like, if you have to ask if one item in a room full of other people's stuff is your gf's, then it's probably hers. I feel like he was fairly sure it was hers and was just being an ass about the whole thing, even more so now that she's asking him to replace it.", "This is why I stopped doing that.\n\nI have a spot that I put all my items for donation into, and when the pile gets big enough to be annoying I drive it to the drop off center.", "We have three cats ourselves. Do you have any steps/instructions you can share on how you turn the socks into cat toys?", "Not being willing to look at subsequent texts of GF's was the central error.\n\nWho doesn't look at texts when the situation is likely to cause a non-family member (GF) to have questions or responses?", "Of course, but it's still icky, especially to a 4th grader.\n\nI saw a dentist once during my entire childhood and only because he went to a family member's church and did it practically for free, so I am aware of how poverty works. Also, some parents, rich or poor, are just assholes who wouldn't replace a lost retainer out of spite. That's why I will always be in favor of providing free meals for children regardless of their parents' income, no questions asked. I knew way too many rich kids in high school who never had lunch money because mom and dad didn't give af. Meanwhile, I ate breakfast and lunch every day because we were broke and my mom filled out the forms every year. \n\nWait, what were we talking about?", "That's great info - would you mind sharing which charity shops have this? I've not spotted it in my (many) years of charity shop shopping.", "My mom decades ago got told at a donation spot that clothes not good enough to be sold got made into rag rugs or the really nasty just rags. This was in the US. Don\u2019t know if it is still true.", "I'll buy your thrift socks. Or anyone elses", "Cheap ass", "But OP admitted that he realized it was a joke right away? \nHe was literally just being lazy and now is complaining about it lol", ">fuck around and find out\n\nCalling card of annoying redditor", "Patchwork, rugs, doll clothes for a young family member...old clothes has a lot of use.", "5 bags of clothes to go through or a new jacket. OP chose poorly.", "I think it\u2019s too late for points tbh. Maybe if he did it originally. Now he\u2019ll be lucky if he even gets forgiven right away. He\u2019s shown his selfish side to her at least twice - once, not retrieving it, and again by not agreeing to get the jacket. Probably more since I\u2019m sure there has been plenty of arguments too", "I hope he does or his next post might be: AITA for breaking up with my gf over a jacket?", "In other words, she'll end up right by having said they belonged to his ex.", "But also like maybe don't throw shit away that you know definitively isn't yours when you're in a shared housing situation?? My ex used to do this in spaces I considered \"mine\" and I fucking lost it one day because he was \"just trying to help clean up\" snd inadvertently threw away something I had an emotional connection to & plans to use.  Like hey why don't you clean up the messes YOU make and ask before you throw shit in the trash? I didn't go into his office which was largely unwalkable for clothes and Amazon boxes on the floor and throw away his belongings.", "I\u2019m thinking there\u2019s more to it because even though OP says it was old and he didn\u2019t know, for some reason he still felt it necessary to take a picture and send it to GF. Unless he was doing that with every item of clothing, he recognised it and knew rightly it was hers.", "OP is definitely the AH. He is fully responsible for putting it in the trash and could have easily gone to get it out. Who throws out perfectly good clothing anyway? He could at least donate it.", "It\u2019s his childhood bedroom full of stuff he left behind and his parents shoved in there? That\u2019s not quite the same thing as throwing away stuff in an apartment you share with a significant other."]}
