{"id": 32071, "submission_id": "187r2ip", "title": "AITA for telling someone that they WILL get therapy for food insecurity because I will not tolerate it?", "selftext": "I'm being called controlling and forceful. Both are true, technically speaking, given the situation but generally on a day to day I don't make demands such as these. Been with my BF for 3 years and he moved in 2 months ago. I have 2 kids. There was not even the slightest hint of food insecurity prior to him moving in but that's probably because when we would eat together, we usually went out and bought food from restaurants. Not only that but he's also not food insecure when it comes to me. It's only my kids.\n\nSince he moved in, we have gone grocery shopping probably 4 times now. Each time we go he loads the cart up with stuff that he wants. We have both paid for groceries. I wouldn't say 50/50 because I have paid for most of it because it's food my kids are eating and whatever. But anyways, whenever the kids have more than one snack, he gets panicked. \"They don't really need that do they?\", \"They're going to eat everything.\", \"They arent leaving anything for anyone else.\" Kids snacks, mind you. I don't care if he has some but they are literally kids snacks. Gummies, crackers, small bags of chips/popcorn, etc. And no, he's not being a dick about it. It's literally a hushed, panicked tone. Like we are going to collapse over my kids eating snacks (I'm make more than enough money to support my kids eating habits so money is NOT an issue). I told him he shouldn't concern himself with what my kids eat and he moved forward.\n\nBut a couple weeks ago it spiraled in to dinners. If my kids have more than 2 helpings (not often at all but if it's their favorites, absolutely), he started bouncing his leg up and down and staring at how much they are taking from the pan. One time he even overloaded his plate, ate 2 bites and put the rest in the fridge so he could eat it before my kids could. And again, he's not even being a dick. It's literal panic. Like he's not going to be able to eat because my kids are eating. He was in foster care for 2 years. Maybe something happened there that caused it. Who knows. But when he started hiding food and started gaining noticeable weight because he was trying to eat food (when he wasnt hungry) just so he could have it before the kids did, I did lose it a bit. I told him he either will get therapy for the food insecurity because I will not tolerate it or we were done. So now he thinks I'm controlling and forceful. That he \"doesn't have food insecurity but your kids eat too much\".\n\nETA: I do want to say that this is only when it comes to food. Otherwise he is a completely different person. He hangs out with the kids, gets involved in their activities (even lets my daughter put makeup on him and paint his nails). He's always going out of his way to buy gifts at random; like a vanity for my daughter and a VR for my son. So he's definitely not being an ass directly but the kids do notice the food issue and have asked me about it. We do have a stash box for him under the bed and he has more snacks under there than we have in the entire house but he still panics if the kids eat the food in the kitchen. I feel like there's no win without him getting professional help.", "created_utc": 1701373144, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187r2ip/aita_for_telling_someone_that_they_will_get/", "score": 723, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But you have to put your kids first, and having every snack they eat and every spoon they take from the casserole dish scrutinized, judged, and treated like an emergency is a fast track to fucking up their relationship with food. As is (holy shit) having an adult authority figure hoard and hide what is meant to be share food specifically so they can\u2019t have it. And believe me, even if he\u2019s trying to conceal his reaction from the kids\u2026 they know. They know he thinks he has a right to this food but they do not. They know he thinks they eat too much. How that plays out for them is determined by what you do.\n\nRight now you have one person in the house with seriously disordered eating; if you tolerate this you\u2019ll soon have three. Letting him continue this way without addressing it won\u2019t help him but might give your kids their own set of lifelong food issues.\n\nDoes he scrutinize what you eat of the shared food, incidentally? Or just the kids?", "NTA.\n\nHe does need therapy. He's living in fear and he doesn't have to, and it's hard to see loved ones struggle like that. If its trauma from his foster care years then it's even sadder that he's been struggling for this long. \n\nI've dealt with food insecurity issues before and one of the things that helped a lot was to get a sealed container of some kind (that only he has access to) and put non-perishable food in there that is *only* for him. The juiceboxes and kids snacks he likes are perfect because the packaging will keep his stash bug free. He can keep his box in his car, closet, under the bed, etc but the box needs to be somewhere the kids don't go and you won't touch it either. \n\nHe's still allowed/encouraged to eat with the family and share in the communal food/snacks but the box is extra security for him when he starts to get anxious. For example, when he starts bouncing his leg at the dinner table you could come up with a code phrase that means 'go check on your food stash and take a few minutes to get your anxiety under control'. \n\nI hope he decides to get help. Even if he's not interested in therapy, there is a lot he can do to work on this on his own.", "NTA\n\nHe needs therapy but it seems he doesn't know it. \n\nThis is where your boundaries come in. \nTell him \"I'm sorry I am going to be mean but we can't live like this. We're all on eggshells, yourself included. I will not put my children through this. You have a choice of either going to therapy or moving back out\"\n\nThe more you watch what kids eat, the more they eat. Especially if he's acting like this and they can tell. Don't need the kids worrying either.", "NTA-he is making things uncomfortable for your children. Having someone freak out and watch them creepily while they eat is going to cause psychological issues for them. They are your first priority. \n\nHim having therapy and changing his behavior should be the absolute lowest bar for him to stay with you.", "I would worry about the kids internalizing his comments.", "Some friends of mine are fostering two children, and they kept finding food hidden in their room. I told them it was food insecurities from not being taken care of by their parents. Now that they know they\u2019re going to get three meals a day and snacks it stopped. This is a grown man and I understand that he was in foster care and that that does happen in foster care as wellbut if there is a problem with food being in the house he\u2019s being ridiculous. Kids snack. Kids eat well and I think that\u2019s a great thing.", "Nta this is the kind of thing someone *does* need therapy for.  It's affecting his physical health and his relationships. \n\nNot wanting to stay with someone who refuses to get help for mental issues doesn't make you an ahole.", "Nta. Tell him in front of your kids,  \"the only reason to look at someone else's plate is to make sure they have enough,  not to see if they have more than you. \" \n\nRepeat as necessary. \n\nHe never needs to look at what anyone else eats.  Ever.  The kids need to hear this too so they don't internalize this bad relationship with food.", "NTA.\n\nIt's weird and gross how it's centered on your kids and he's trying to justify it because \"they eat too much.\" *He's* being controlling, even if it comes from a place of trauma, which it almost certainly does.\n\nBut yeah, dude needs help and it concerns me that he's not only unwilling to get it but also seems to think the *real* problem is your kids eating too much. Stick to your guns on this one. It *will* affect your kids, even if they're too young to notice right now they're gonna notice eventually.", "NTA and you're right to set this boundary or ultimatum or whatever. You cannot have him messing up your kids' relationship with food, and/or giving them an eating disorder. \n\nIf he doesn't immediately start working on it and showing improvement, you don't have to break up but I would definitely have him move out.\n\nETA: \n\n>So it's almost like he is subconsciously treating the situation like it's me and him (or kid age- him and his brother) vs kids (kids at foster care).\n\nI think this is a really valid observation you made and it's very concerning. He cannot divide your household as him and you against your own children. It's food now, but it could spill over into other areas and you can guarantee your kids are noticing. It's also alarming that when you defend your kids, he calls you controlling. On further thought, I vote (like I have a vote lol) that you have him move out now and work on things (if you want to stay with him) at a distance so your kids stay safe.", "NTA. this is definitely trauma and it\u2019s on him to process and work through it. not only is it affecting him, it\u2019s affecting you and your kids.", "I have this. I know it's my issue. How have I dealt with it raising my child and ask his friends?\n\nI probably have the most well stocked pantry. The kids are allowed whatever they want. Just notify me when you've opened the next to last item.\n\nThis kept me calm and them eating whatever they want.\n\nNTA but maybe you could try this method to help him out?", "Your children notice the way he's acting, whether they mention it or not it *will have an effect on them*.\n\nYour daughter is especially vulnerable to disordered eating with a parental figure behaving the way your boyfriend is.\n\nYou're right that he needs help, but the hard truth is that until he *wants* help, nothing will get better.\n\nYou need to make it clear that keeping your kids safe and mentally well is your priority, and that means he needs to get help. Have a solid plan for if he refuses and follow through.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this. It's not fair to any of you.", "NTA homie def needs therapy. Being ima foster home can do all kinds of damage especially when ur competing with other kids. Just have patience as childhood trauma can take forever to resolver if it ever does. goodluck to you.", "NTA. Your kids come first. They don't need to see anxiety like that. The behaviour might become normalised for them.\n\nHere's hoping this gives him the jolt he needs and he gets professional help.", "NTA. He is an asshole for saying that your kids eat too much though, panic and trembling legs might be something he does not control, but his words after the fact totally are. Your children will be traumatized if this does not stop, being abused is no excuse to become an abuser.", "NTA\n\nThis is what folks on this subreddit like to call a boundary.  If he doesn't fix X, then sadly you will need to do Y.  \n\nIt's possible that he thinks you're controlling because you're not only telling him what needs to be fixed (the food behaviour) but the manner in which he should be fixing it (therapy).  But I frankly can't see how he can fix this without help, so I think what you did it okay in this case. \n\nBe prepared to set timelines if you have to. Not deadlines by which the problem must be solved (because that can't be predicted), but deadlines by which he needs to show evidence of having taken action, e.g. made an appointment with a therapist.  \n\nI understand that he's a good person, but this is a dealbreaker.  He needs to take it seriously.", "No he needs to address this before he passes it on to the children, he's going to make them anxious about eating which can intern cause an eating disorder. It's unfair of him to carry on like this when there are options for him out the re to get a grip on it. He absolutely needs to get on top of it", "NTA. You have to put your kids first. So what if they want a little extra dinner or an extra snack, they\u2019re growing, it\u2019s healthy. It does sound like he was food insecure growing up at some point but he has no right to take that out on literal children! It sounds like he needs help for anxiety and potentially an eating disorder caused/amplified by anxiety. Take care of yourself and your kids.", "NTA. He needs to move out because he is stressing out the household.", "NTA. Some foster parents I know keep a cart with easy snacks. Like cereal, granola Bars. Essentially a self serve station. It helps letting the kids know they have constant access without too much pressure. Maybe he needs something similar but yes he needs to learn to cope and relearn bad habits into good ones. He has an eating disorder right now in regards to food insecurity.", "My cousin's oldest son had food withheld from him by his mom's husband because the boy wasn't his \"flesh and blood\" the exact words from the man's mouth in front of our entire family at my grandma's wake. He was 14 years old and rail thin and his mother's husband had a waistline of 52\"! I got in the man's face and called him out on his actions when the boy went back for seconds because he was so hungry. I asked him when was the last time he ate and he said it was the morning before Mimi passed away. He had been all day and night without food!! I asked my cousin why she would allow a man to withhold food from her son, her answer was \"but he loves me.\" I walked outside and looked at my aunt and said, \"either you take him in to live here or I will mandatory report your daughter for not taking care of her son!\" He moved with his grandparents to Missouri.", "Food insecurity is the economic condition in which a person does not have enough money to buy enough food to sustain their health. The behavior you are describing is a mental/ behavioral illness which seems to have extreme anxiety plus disordered eating behavior. Is this trauma from childhood hunger or other abuse? He needs therapy NOW and his behavior with your children sounds harmful, both nutritionally and emotionally. Therapy NOW. And stop exposing your children to his borderline abusive treatment of them. You are NTA, but you have to act.", "NTA Everyone who is not saying this will affect the kids is absolutely right. When protecting your children you do need to be forceful. If he won\u2019t do therapy, he needs to move out. I know that\u2019s a sad outcome but you have to put your children first.", "NTA, he does need therapy. But therapy isn't a quick fix, and it sounds like maybe he shouldn't eat meals with you guys until he gets this under control. \n\nI don't know how you have your pantry organized, but maybe having a basket specifically for kid snacks will help him better visualize what is an isn't available. Like, that's the basket he doesn't even need to worry about. \n\nBut if he's not willing to see the issue at all, he needs to leave. You can't have someone poisoning your kids' relationship with food and he's already started, even if it isn't intentional.", "NTA. Great call. Definitely needs to go to therapy over it. It\u2019s not mean-spirited so it\u2019s clear it\u2019s a fear of being deprived causing him to border on an eating disorder. Having a household with two children and managing a relationship with a parter in denial about their mental illness is a heavy load. Please be kind to him, but be firm and state facts to reassure him. 1. Kids have appetites that fluate as they grow with healthy children. 2. Money is not an issue and in the event snacks are eaten they can be replaced on the next grocery trip. But you are valid and NTA for wanting a healthy environment for you and your kids. He could give them a complex with his relationship with food.", "NTA\n\nAs a previous foster kid and now foster parent. It\u2019s related to foster care and his home life. It\u2019s pretty common. Definitely the hiding food. Work with him, maybe a locked cabinet or mini fridge in the garage for his snacks and drinks so he isn\u2019t worried the kids will eat his snacks so he can stop hiding them and get a little more regulated. Maybe a snack cart for your kids so he knows those are their snacks and he doesn\u2019t have to worry about what they take. But, yes he needs therapy. For there to be peace in the home but more so it\u2019s time. He doesn\u2019t have to carry this anymore.", "So he's either in need of therapy and is oblivious too it, or is going to be controlling when it comes to your children's food...

His reactions, I guarantee you, are not passing unnoticed by them and he is causing all of you psychological distress.\n\nI have sympathy for him, but that comes second to my sympathy for your children, and for you. He has a choice to try to stop feeling this way and reacting like this, and he has chosen to not stop.\n\nI wouldn't even give him the option of therapy or leaving. I would insist he leave right now, and *maybe* start dating again in six months if he has gotten therapy, resolved his issues, apologised to you, and you trust him again.", "NTA My second late husband spent time in foster care after his parents died; all the greatest hits horror stories.

You can however put up a boundary that you\u2019re not going to allow that behavior around your kids.", "i was married to someone who never had enough food growing up. He always demanded I cook three times the size of a normal meal. He had 5 brothers and sisters where this would have made sense. We had 2 small children so the amount made no sense. Then he would eat like half of it and make me throw the rest away because he \"makes too much money\" to eat leftovers. After awhile he realized the size of meals the children and I were eating compared to what he ate and he got really angry because it made him look  like a pig. He tried to force us to eat more food. It took gaining 60 pounds and being diagnosed with diabetes to clue him in. Good luck to you. I hate that he is taking this out on the kids. It means he sees them as rivals/enemies.", "NTA but he is.

I know now they weren't, but it made me resent them at that time, so i don't think forcefully implementing that will bring you anything but resentment and a lot of hurt on both sides. That said you absolutely have the right and moral obligation to protect your kids, i just don't think trying to remove someones autonomy on any subject and forcing their hand is a way to go, at least it wont end in your favor, just state that meddling in your kids eating habits is a boundary for you and let him decide if he can respect it if not part ways.

NTA", "you could have been gentler but I don't think your assessment is wrong.\n\nINFO: However, have you brought this up with him before? Pointed out the behavior, asked him to seek help, etc?

However, both for his and the kids sake there is something you could do.\n\nSnackboxes. Simple containers that will have snacks specially for that person. In his case loaded for the week.

Even if he chooses not to eat it, it will be there.\n\nI too get stressed out about the idea of no food, despite being obese (working on it, lost 15kg in the past year but big challenge). I want to eat more when stressed. A year ago I sought help after still getting really frustrated when my so ate the last chocolate, despite me having eaten half a kilo that week.\n\nI can now resist snacks better, but it took a lifestyle coach and dietician to work out my main obstacles and sabotaging thoughts. And as my brain works completely different from my so, we need different sollutions. Best way to stop hiding and stockpiling food? Have clear portions marked as mine that he won't touch. \n\nPut his snacks in a different container than the kids snacks. Set aside a lunch sized portion of dinner in case he wants more later. Even if he ends up not eating it, having it there uncontested may help a lot. There is now a small bar of chocolate in my snackdrawer that's been untouched for a week. But I have opened the drawer nearly every day to check before deciding I didn't need it. Babysteps.\n\nTry to figure this out together, you're a team.

This probably.\n\n> either will get therapy for the food insecurity because I will not tolerate it or we were done\n\nSo, that's quite a bit different from a caring response for someone suffering childhood trauma.

He can't keep this up, but the ultimatum is a bit harsh when he clearly has issues surrounding this. I don't think \"therapy or we're done\" is appropriate yet-he's only making comments, gaining weight, and taking larger portions. That's problematic behavior, but not really that bad. It's a little abusive to jump to \"fix that or we're done.\" You've already sent him into a mindset where failure is not an option-that's pretty hostile.\n\nHe isn't harming you or your kids-you could meet him halfway here. Have a reasonable discussion about it and encourage a discussion with a professional. Don't weaponize therapy.", "YTA.  Not for wanting to protect your kids from his insecurity, but for being controlling.  Two wrongs don't make a right.  And therapy won't help unless he wants to be helped.  You can ask him to do joint counseling for this issue which might be easier for him to agree to, at least at first.  Forced therapy has never worked in my experience.  It just makes things worse.", "Info:  Are your kids eating too much?  You mention that this was happening when your kids were eating more than 2 helpings of dinner.  It was also being triggered by them eating more than one snack at a time.  They seems like A LOT.

Food insecurity? Telling him to get therapy? I am an nhs dietician. Yikes. We are facing an epidemic of overweight kids and kids with type 2 diabetes. Sounds like he cares for these kids and wants them to be healthy. You saying you can afford all that food doesnt stop diabetes, high insulin response, blood sugar crashes etc etc.", "Im going to go against the grain and give a gentle, respectful, YTA and NOT because you\u2019re in the wrong. You are NOT in the wrong for setting a boundary. But your approach was hot headed, and your ultimatum was from an emotionally angry place. And that\u2019s what was wrong: there\u2019s no taking back what\u2019s been said and done in anger. Again, absolutely in the right for standing up for the wellbeing of your children, but you were an AH in your approach. It happens, we are human and our emotions can get the best of us sometimes but if your ultimatum was presented differently, there probably would\u2019ve been different results. Once again for those who have selective reading and comprehension, OP IS NOT WRONG IN WANTING TO SET THIS BOUNDARY. OP SHOULD ENFORCE BOUNDARY. Just not in the way that she did because it wasn\u2019t productive for anyone, and the goal of all confrontation should be to peacefully reach a desirable outcome for all. Sometimes parting ways is the best solution. However I don\u2019t think it should be the case with this one:\n\nFirst, don\u2019t take it personal that he\u2019s saying you\u2019re controlling in regard to his food insecurity. That is the trauma and the anxiety talking, not him. \n\nSecond, he\u2019s not in a place to receive what you\u2019re saying right now, but if he is amazing in all other areas maybe his moving in was premature. You may not need to toss the whole relationship for this, especially if the pros outweigh the cons (no one is perfect: we all have issues that we need to work on). Sometimes taking a step back is necessary in order to move forward. There\u2019s nothing wrong with acknowledging you both weren\u2019t ready for this move in and agreeing to find your own spaces so that both parties can continue to heal and evolve. (BTW: moving in together doesn\u2019t always have to be the end all be all. If yall work amazing together in separate homes, then there\u2019s nothing wrong with that). \n\nThird, check on the kids because like everyone is saying this could damage them. For sure put their wellbeing first. And I\u2019m sure he would agree to that because he sounds like a sweet guy with a problem he needs help and support for. \n\nFourth, denial is NOT the same as refusal. It sounds like he\u2019s in denial because he probably isn\u2019t aware of himself when he\u2019s triggered. I would encourage you to call your local support groups/resources for advice on what to do. Eventually it\u2019s up to you on how much you want to invest in his recovery and healing, and there\u2019s no blame or judgment if you don\u2019t want to take this journey with him.", "You sound a little harsh for sure.

Both are true, technically speaking, given the situation but generally on a day to day I don't make demands such as these. Been with my BF for 3 years and he moved in 2 months ago. I have 2 kids. There was not even the slightest hint of food insecurity prior to him moving in but that's probably because when we would eat together, we usually went out and bought food from restaurants. Not only that but he's also not food insecure when it comes to me. It's only my kids.\n\nSince he moved in, we have gone grocery shopping probably 4 times now. Each time we go he loads the cart up with stuff that he wants. We have both paid for groceries. I wouldn't say 50/50 because I have paid for most of it because it's food my kids are eating and whatever. But anyways, whenever the kids have more than one snack, he gets panicked. \"They don't really need that do they?\", \"They're going to eat everything.\", \"They arent leaving anything for anyone else.\" Kids snacks, mind you. I don't care if he has some but they are literally kids snacks. Gummies, crackers, small bags of chips/popcorn, etc. And no, he's not being a dick about it. It's literally a hushed, panicked tone. Like we are going to collapse over my kids eating snacks (I'm make more than enough money to support my kids eating habits so money is NOT an issue). I told him he shouldn't concern himself with what my kids eat and he moved forward.\n\nBut a couple weeks ago it spiraled in to dinners. If my kids have more than 2 helpings (not often at all but if it's their favorites, absolutely), he started bouncing his leg up and down and staring at how much they are taking from the pan. One time he even overloaded his plate, ate 2 bites and put the rest in the fridge so he could eat it before my kids could. And again, he's not even being a dick. It's literal panic. Like he's not going to be able to eat because my kids are eating. He was in foster care for 2 years. Maybe something happened there that caused it. Who knows. But when he started hiding food and started gaining noticeable weight because he was trying to eat food (when he wasnt hungry) just so he could have it before the kids did, I did lose it a bit. I told him he either will get therapy for the food insecurity because I will not tolerate it or we were done. So now he thinks I'm controlling and forceful. That he \"doesn't have food insecurity but your kids eat too much\".\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You're right - there's definitely a need for therapy there.", "Oh man. NTA.", "NTA. From what you posted it sounds like he is normally very kind to you and the kids. If you are looking for an empathetic response to talk sense into him try something like \"I love you, and think you are a wonderful person, and so kind to the kids and I, but your anxiety over food is hurting our relationship, and may have harmful effects on the kids.\"\n\nTalking men into therapy can be super hard since we basically have \"be a tough guy\" drilled into us from a young age, a lot of men look at needing therapy as a personal failure.", "NTA, you don\u2019t want your kids forming weird habits around food.\n\nWhatever reason he has the insecurity issues are not his fault, but not getting help and letting it possibly effect kids is. Telling kids they\u2019re eating too much is gonna end badly and could make them have similar issues. He needs to get help before it continues to escalate.", "NTA but he needs therapy. Massive amounts of it. Badly. And I know you excuse it, but he DOES resent the kids or he wouldn't be greedily shoving it into his increasing paunch to deprive them of it.", "NTA. He needs therapy. It\u2019s definitely from being in foster care. My husband was in foster care after foster care for years before his parents adopted him. He\u2019s a stress eater for sure but also I have to portion out his meals or he will literally eat it all and then feel sick. My dad even said something on Thanksgiving to me about how much food he puts on his plate but then will be too full to eat it all. My husband has had years of therapy and is back in it which is helping. It\u2019s just childhood trauma and it\u2019s hard to deal with but if he\u2019s worth it you guys will forgive it out.", "Whatever his \nissues/problems with food are they are not your children\u2019s burden. You need to give this guy a 30 day notice to move out. He is creating an unhealthy environment for your children. And it is about your children. You said he only has an issue with your kids and food. Specifically how often they eat and how much. He even said your kids eat too much!!! I would have put his ass out them and there. You would be TA if you allowed him to stay.\n\n***My mom worked with a woman whose husband controlled their kids food. He would lock the food up when she would leave for work and would ration food and control portions. All five kids have issues with food***", "NTA He needs to sort this out not only for himself, but so that he doesn\u2019t cause your kids to have food-related issues.", "NTA. sounds like he possibly had to compete for food in foster care and was maybe neglected. It is sad but put your kids first.", "NTA - it does not sound like a healthy environment for your children. If he doesn\u2019t want to get help to change it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s good for your kids to be around him.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to address this problem of his or he will make it a your-kids-problem and they do not need his traumas on them. They are kids, they need to grow and are more active than adults; if they are hungry they should eat. \n\nMaybe they don\u2019t need the third plate just because it\u2019s their favorite, he has a point that it isn\u2019t needed (otherwise they\u2019d always do it and they should leave a third plate for later instead) but that is not his concern. He can talk to you about it, but he cannot tell you that your kids cannot eat the food you buy, especially not when they aren\u2019t overweight and being unhealthy and there is no concern for money. \n\nHe does need therapy and you are a great mother for setting a good example for your kids and setting boundaries and not tolerating BS", "NTA. \n\nYou seem to have a great handle on him having this specific issue and realizing it is a mental health issue and not him being mean or selfish on purpose. \n\nI also think you are right, he needs therapy, and this isn't going to work out if he doesn't. If there is money in the bank, it doesn't matter if the kids eat the entire pantry in one day, because the response is \"we will get more food tomorrow.\" You say money isn't an issue, and clearly he isn't concerned about health or weight of your children (not that it would be his concern), so this is fully a him issue. \n\nAnd I really want you to know that if he keeps acting this way, it will absolutely impact your kids. When you aren't around, they are going to eat a snack or have a helping of something and it is going to set him off. They are also very aware of his general attitude and the quiet comments he makes, or the way he takes food. Make no mistake that what you have noticed, your kids notice and it will (or has already) made them uncomfortable in their own home, may give them food issues, and probably nervous around your partner.\n\nSo just be clear with him- the children eat a normal amount, you have the money to feed them the way they eat, and so his opinion doesn't matter AND is negatively impacting your children, and you can't tolerate that. So, you aren't telling him what to do, you are simply telling him what you will and won't tolerate in a relationship. He can either seek help and stay together, or refuse to admit he has a problem/change and he needs to leave.", "NTA. He needs to move out before he messes up your kids. He has issues to deal with before he can handle living with other people.", "NTA but I\u2019d end it personally. Why should your kids have to deal with the burden of that. And what if he become reactive to them eventually when he is more comfortable.", "Why are you subjecting your children to this? Are you sure it\u2019s about food insecurity or about control?", "NTA unless you allow him to remain in your children\u2019s home. He is clearly not ready for therapy (as he is calling you controlling and refusing to acknowledge the problem) and your job is to protect your children. \n\nBoyfriend needs to move out.", "NTA as someone who's had terrible anxiety around food. It's not good long term for anyone involved regardless of him saying otherwise. I still remember my dad refusing to buy anything us kids would eat because \"They'll eat all of it\" as if that wasn't what my mom bought it for. My mom was the only breadwinner, and we were on financial assistance/had food stamps at the time. Yet he'd throw a fit if he didn't have his favorite foods every day. I don't have a relationship with him now due to other reasons but I can tell you it wasn't good for my relationship with food (which again, I had other reasons for how bad mine got) and that is exactly why you need to nip this in the bud right now", "NAH. I feel for him and it sounds like he really had it drilled into him when he was young. \n\nThat said these are YOUR kids and you are paying for their food. He needs to get it under control and learn that he isn't in the same place now as he was growing up.", "NTA but you can't force him to get therapy. Even if he agrees to, it might take time to find the right therapist, or maybe the therapy won't help him. Therapy isn't magic and it's not always easily available or affordable.   \n\n\nI'd say the situation as it is is untenable and I'd reconsider living with him. Surely you saw this before in the 3 years you've known him? Your kids wellbeing is more important than his food issues.", "It sounds like something that he either takes care of with therapy, as you demanded, or it will spill onto your kids and cause them to have eating disorders.\n\nNTA.

You need to make sure your kids are alright and it sucks that you are compatible in every other way but this is a doozy and he will give you or himself a heart attack and your kids an eating or shame disorder if things continue as they are.", "He needs to move out immediately AND go to therapy. The moving out is non-negotiable. NTA.", "NTA\n\nThat is so sad and hard. I hope he can get some help.", "NTA. I used to work in a group home for foster kids and I still get sad thinking about the food insecurity. We used to find food stashed in drawers, toy boxes, behind books on the bookshelves. We once had a toddler, who was old enough to walk but not talk yet. If you gave them any food, they'd go hide half in their bed before eating any. When we'd get siblings the older kids would not eat until they saw their little siblings eat first. It didn't matter if they saw how much food was prepared, that they saw more food in the kitchen or that everyone had a plate. \n\nMy heart hurts for your bf but he needs help. This isn't an issue that's going to just go away on its own and it could cause food insecurity for the kids.", "NTA yet but if you love your kids you\u2019ll protect them from him.

He\u2019s not even the one buying all the food! He has no right to control anything.", "NTA. \n\nKids need plenty of food and nutrients. Because he has trauma he is projecting his fears and traumas on to you and your kids. That is NOT okay. He needs help and therapy is a good tool for that. NTA at all.", "NTA. He\u2019s involving the children. Children get to eat first and whatever have left are free real estate for parents.", "You're incorrect about him not being a dick. Throw him out.", "NTA. He needs therapy. And you should be shopping and cooking/eating separately until he does. This is not fair for your children. These going to make them have a poor relationship with food if he keeps this up", "NAH. My ex was like this. He grew up really poor and was always buying way more food than we could eat and also worried about me fixing dinner and how much. He could probably talk to someone about what is causing this. It's not normal.", "NTA. This is a serious problem. His behavior can easily freak your kids out. Given that he was raised in foster care, you\u2019re probably right about his food fixation. This doesn\u2019t sound at all like he\u2019s a bad person. You likely hit the nail on the head. This will affect your kids, and it\u2019s not normal.

He would definitely be happier with some therapy, and so would the rest of you if he was able to loosen up and relax.\n\nSaying that, I get it. I have major food insecurities myself because growing up if I ate something in the kitchen without permission (even just a slice of bread) I was punished first for \u201cstealing\u201d and then for \u201clying\u201d if I didn\u2019t record it in my mandatory food diary. So now I live in a nursing home and can eat as much as I want at every meal (and the food is delicious) and anytime I need (or just want) a snack I can get bread, yogurt, sandwiches, fruit, peanut butter, cookies, etc from the kitchen\u2026 except when we (still) go into COVID breakout lockdowns and those of us on the higher needs side are locked out from the lower needs side - where the kitchen is located. I know I will still get my meals and can load up on extras for later, but just the psychological impact of knowing I\u2019m not able to go to the kitchen myself every second of the day FREAKS ME THE FUCK OUT. \n\nI\u2019ve had meltdowns and full blown anxiety attacks being separated from the kitchen if someone who is new and isn\u2019t familiar with my history and needs hesitates when I ask them to bring me half a dozen apples and yogurts. True, I only eat about one or two of each a day. But if I don\u2019t have at least three days worth of food stored up in my room I just panic. Luckily (?) for me the solution is simple - they just need to let me know right before lockdown officially activates so that I can stock up myself. But occasionally if the staff who knows me well enough to know that I need this warning isn\u2019t in, all hell breaks loose.\n\nI also get $300 personal allowance from the government each month and even though the nursing home is completely responsible for feeding me I still spend the majority of my allowance on snacks from Amazon.

Like, an absurd amount.", "Having legitimate mental health issues doesn't make his *behavior* not weird and gross.", "That\u2019s all true, but it\u2019s equally true this could very likely cause long term problems for OP\u2019s children, and their first responsibility is to them, as their parent.", "This answers explains it well! Great answer and renews my faith people still have empathy on this subreddit. People come from all sorts of backgrounds and develop survival techniques that may not be healthy but they survived and now have to learn how to deal with the past which is painful to look at but it\u2019s more heartbreaking and frustrating vs weird and gross.", "The first thing that went through my head was, \"if the kids run out and all that's left is his, they'll need to eat it\" I get his anxiety. Food insecurity sucks.", "His brain subconsciously sees you as the person he provides for and protects and sees the kids as competition, he obvious doesn\u2019t see it on a conscious level and genuinely needs you to sit down and calmly explain the Babur and link it for him because he won\u2019t see it and maybe even push back hard on it because no one wants to be that way, but he needs some help and that\u2019s okay, it\u2019s not weak to need help with trauma which he might see it as.\n\nHe also has to know that if he doesn\u2019t fix this it can and will affect your children and pass that trauma on and that\u2019s no okay and I am sure he wouldn\u2019t want to do it.\n\nAlso tell him from one fear anxiety eater to another -please see someone if you can afford it. I can\u2019t so I just put on weight at the moment because my brain sees physical pain and has a cptsd response of eat food it fix.", "It was also kids he was competing with for food when he had food insecurity.", "The kid food is probably representative of the food that was withheld from him because he was deemed unworthy or constantly stolen from him by the bullies in the household. There was probably a locked fridge and no allies who snuck him food. And I get him only focusing on the kids' meals because his fellow foster siblings had to compete for food and you can bet the adults pitted the kids against each other. \n\nI wonder if there's a trusted person in your family/friend circle who might be more successful in pointing out the need for therapy than OP. Someone who can intervene with the choices he needs to make: therapy or move out without turning him back into an unwanted foster kid without agency  who only represents a source of income for greedy people with little to no care for his emotional well-being. I really hope this can be resolved with therapy for him, otherwise he sounds like a good partner and adult male figure for the kids.", "If he eats the same types of snacks try buying separate snacks. Like this box of fruit roll ups is just for you and this other box is for the twins. That way they aren\u2019t \u201ceating it all\u201d and he knows he still has his own dedicated box or whatever. \n\nBut I agree, NTA for requesting he get help for what is obviously an escalating ED.", "Show him this post and the responses, which overwhelmingly say this is atypical, related to trauma, and requires therapy to overcome - for his sake and the children\u2019s. Therapy will help him develop tools that are useful for him as an adult, to replace the instincts that were protective when he was a vulnerable child.", "Yeah, I totally see what you're saying.   \n\n\nI would make sure (I'm sure you have) that your partner knows that they see it and are concerned, and if he pushes back AGAIN saying \"YEAH BUT THEY EAT TOO MUCH\", well then I'd be pretty on board with getting more forceful. \n\nIt really just does need to be a stance of \"my kids come first, it's not up to you to decide whether how much they eat is appropriate, and that's the end of the story\".", "That's the thing you can help your children and not force him. You can point out that being mean to your kids is a boundary without actually being forceful about going to therapy. If he knows he's mean and that it's not okay with you and doesn't stop or gets help you are right to leave. He's a selfish asshole in that case. You are going about this as if you could actually be forceful enough for him to relent and that's not true. He probably won't even if that's your favorite option. \n\nBeing at the point where you can't be compassionate with your partner is a big red flag as it is.", "You can use compassion to help him get help. You don\u2019t have to use threats.", "It is already fucking up your children.  Also, even if he starts to get help today, it might be *years* before he resolves his issues, IF he ever does.  Please take that into consideration.", "Probably because it's normal to have more than 1 snack a day and she said it isn't often that they have more than 2 helpings.", "Yeah, it\u2019s entirely possible he is completely unaware of the why in the way you just described. That had to be a painful experience as a kid.", "One of the biggest fights I ever got into with my ex husband (he had a terrible, fucked up, parent-and-food-insecure childhood... oh and also violence. Like I said, fucked up) was when we were trying to reconcile and live together again.\n\nHim: 2 girls. Me: 2 girls. All 4 roughly the same age.\n\nHe liked feeding his from his plate. He ate all dinners and the leftovers. He \"had anxiety\" and \"didn't think it was necessary\" for our oldest girls (11 and 12 at the time) for our daughters to have so much as a cup of tea past dinner, let alone a snack (we're talking healthy protein, yogurt, fruit, etc).\n\nOne of my conditions for moving back in was that the girls would have unrestricted access to the kitchen in the evening. He flat out refused that for his. But I wouldn't budge for mine.\n\nHe lost his shit completely because we were supposed to \"treat them all the same.\"\n\nEta to add - I don't give one fuck about your husband past a cursory 'oh what a shame for him' fast straight shot of empathy.\n\nYOUR MAIN FUCKING JOB IS TO FEED YOUR KIDS AND I DGAF WHAT YOUR ISSUES ARE, MY DUDE.\n\nMama, you are SO NTA. Insist on therapy or get out\u2764\ufe0f", "Agree. He is doing harm to them even if it is unintentional. He needs help or she needs to leave and put her kids first.", "I\u2019d argue that both therapy and getting him away from the kids need to happen, given how quickly behavior like this can trigger eating disorders in children. He needs to stay elsewhere, away from the kids, until he\u2019s dealt with his food insecurity issues in therapy and can eat (and allow others to eat) peacefully and without showing or causing distress.", "Yeah it sounded like complex ptsd to me too. Very much so. \n\nIf that\u2019s the case (ifffffff, I am not a doctor), then that means he cannot - CANNOT - control it consciously no matter how hard he tries. It\u2019s like asking someone to stop splashing when they\u2019re drowning. It\u2019s not logical, you cannot control it with effort or \u201ctrying harder\u201d, and it\u2019s going to keep happening until he gets help - *from a therapist who specializes in C-PTSD*. Cannot stress that last part enough. This shit is hard and the wrong kind of help can and does make it worse (not meaning to scare you, but it\u2019s true.) \n\nGood luck OP. Truly. It\u2019s manageable but you are right he does *NEED* that help.", "That doesn\u2019t actually solve the issue of him passing his anxiety about food to the kids.", "It absolutely does not matter.", "This is a terrific point and one OP really should think through. If she thinks he\u2019s bad now, this will be detrimental to the mental and physical health of her boys in a few years. My kid is a teen and all of my friends who have teen sons are spending $2K a month on food for the household at this point, sometimes more if their sons are athletes.", "This, exactly. I was an average-weight and very active teenager but my grandma would always \\*tut\\* if I asked for a larger portion or an extra helping (she gave me small portions because \"girls should be slim\"). 30 years on I still have food anxiety and struggled with an eating disorder for 20 of those years. The words you say to kids MATTER, the behaviour they see around them MATTERS.", "My brother has binge eating issues and I have issues where wasting a little bit of food (mostly like leftovers after like 3 days, one errant pepper or cucumber, the last 1/16th of a big tub of yogurt, the last two apples out of a Costco-sized bag) and have a bunch of shelf stable stuff in the cabinet makes me feel safe because food insecurity as kids. \n\nNeither of us have kids but we both are sort of interested in maybe fostering someday. We\u2019ve talked a lot about how super conscious we\u2019d be about food issues if either one of us end up fostering later in life. \n\nA combo of the food insecurity, weird mixed messaging from our parents about food and my body when we were more food secure, and the way that people treated me way nicer as I lost weight were all very strong factors in the eating disorder I developed in my early 20\u2019s.", "Of course they can. But statistically girls are way more likely to become anorexic.", "I completely agree. He shouldn\u2019t be around the kids, especially at meal times, until this is under control.", "That was my first thought - has this guy been in prison? My brother was never the same about food after he spent some time in jail.", "Used to volunteer at a boys and girls club.  Don\u2019t remember too many kids eating three or more helpings of a meal after eating numerous snacks throughout the day.", "No, she said they rarely take more than two helpings.  Two helpings is the norm.  He clearly loves the kids based on the last post.

The clearly says they eat a ton of snacks, regularly eat 2 helpings of dinner (if not more) and have an eating habit that she can financially supports.

The kids are at a vulnerable stage where they could develop an ED themselves. They notice his irrational behavior and it can affect them. If he continues to deny what he's doing and blame the kids for his issues, it would be cruel to  her children to demand they put up with it. He needs to admit there's an issue. If that requires him to make choices as to whether he is more attached to his issues than to her, so be it. Tough love can be compassionate. Maybe a strong push is required of him to get help. Regardless, she has to put her kids first.", "Lol spoken like someone never having to deal with a treatment resistant person.", "More than one snack in a single sitting isn\u2019t normal.  And she says it not often, but it\u2019s often enough that she\u2019s taking issue with his reaction to it.  I don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting the full story here.\n\nEdit:  She also specifically says she can afford to support their eating habits financially.  Context clues make me think they really are eating a ton.", "This is the way. I don't have kids, I was just one that was mistreated and abused with food and still learning the insane damage it has done to me.", "Agreed, a therapist would be most beneficial in getting him to a place where he can differentiate between flashbacks and a genuine threat to his safety", "Honestly, if the BF can't control his anxiety when watching kids eat, then he doesn't get to eat with the kids. Period. He gets to eat his dinner by himself, the kids get judgement free meals, and someone needs to explain to the kids that it's the BF's problem, not theirs. That sometimes people that grew up without enough food struggle to adjust to having enough.", "Statistically absolutely, and societal pressure is usually worse for girls than boys but it\u2019s suspected that men have higher than statistically projected rates of eating disorders.

Trauma doesn\u2019t absolve you of personal responsibility.", "when it comes to child abuse, YES it is completely appropriate to explicitly condemn harmful behavior. this is their lives and health at stake, and this is their parent forcing their anxieties on them.\n\nthe grossest part is his complete unwillingness to go to therapy OR even acknowledge a problem! he literally thinks her kids eat too much! that is gross and weird!", "Yeah but it could take him a while to make progress - so I\u2019m just saying it might not be the right time for her to live with him if his constant behavior regarding food going to negatively affect the kids. \n\nI\u2019d feel bad for him, but it\u2019s not fair to kids to put them through that and give them possible lifetime problems.", "Nothing here suggests he resisted getting treatment before OP issued the ultimatum.", "Either way, it's not on OP or her boyfriend to shame them or get panicked at their eating because if there is an eating disorder present, that will make in worse.\n\nThat said, I ate a ton as a child and was constantly hungry until I stopped growing I guess, and my BMI was underweight until I was well into my 20s.", "How can you say they\u2019re not based on what has been said by OP?  Multiple snacks at a time isn\u2019t too much?  Two helpings of dinner being a regular thing and sometimes eating even more than that if it\u2019s a favorite?

We have an obesity problem in this country and it\u2019s because of people like you that don\u2019t care when kids are shoveling food down their throats.  Two servings is a disgusting amount.

A \u201cserving\u201d is a very inexact measurement and likely means more than the suggested serving size.  Even if it doesn\u2019t, two helpings that are the exact suggested serving size can easily total over 1,000 calories in a single meal.  That\u2019s not counting the meals where we have more than two servings and the unhealthy snacks (chips are super high calorie snacks and they\u2019re eating more than one of these at a a time????).  It adds up fast and it\u2019s really not hard to see that these kids are getting way too much food.", "Agreed. I think we\u2019re on the same page here.", "It would be on her to stop indulging bad eating habits though.  I cringed reading all of the unhealthy snacks she was giving them.  It seems like they\u2019re not eating a snack for the flavor of a fun treat, they\u2019re trying to get full off of them.  Now, I do think boyfriend\u2019s behavior is weird at best, but I do think if the kids are big OP really needs to look into that."]}
