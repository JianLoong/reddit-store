I (18M) along with my siblings (20F, 22M and 23F) did not have a relationship with either of them after we learned they started an affair while our mom was undergoing cancer treatment. She discovered the betrayal halfway through her treatment and she filed for divorce while she was going through so much. She also disowned her sister and told her she never wanted to see or hear from her again.\n\nNone of us met their daughter but when our father and aunt passed away this past summer we were contacted twice. Once to inform us of the death that happened in another state and a second time to hear their child was in foster care and questioning if any of the family would take her. We all said no. None of us wanted to establish contact or a relationship with her.\n\nEarly December my oldest sister and I both got messages on FB from someone claiming to be fostering our father's daughter. She said she and her husband wanted to try and facilitate contact between her and her biological relatives but that they also wanted her to hear stories about her parents. My sister responded and I ignored the message. All she said was thanks for thinking of us but we weren't interested and we had no contact with our father or aunt prior to death due to a difficult family situation and she would appreciate if they could respect that and leave us alone. She was polite in her rejection but was also clear.\n\nShe got three more messages until she blocked them. Then I got two. Our other two siblings don't have social media so were harder to reach but the last one I got basically said we were all monsters and we could at the very least look beyond a difficult family dynamic and give their child some nice stories and memories and feelings about the parents she won't remember. That she's innocent and deserves that connection. I was tired of pushy nature of the messages at that point and I responded that they can't force me and my siblings to play pretend and act like we have a good thing to say about either parent and would they really want her to grow up hearing how much her parents are despised. She responded back that I did not have to be so rude and did not have to take this out on her. She said they were trying to look out for their foster daughter like they do for all their foster kids.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1703859782, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18to813/aita_for_telling_my_fathers_daughts_foster/", "score": 2442, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t really see this as you taking this out on your sibling, it sounds like she was never in your life, you never met this kid. \u201cFamily doesn\u2019t end in blood\u201d, but it also doesn\u2019t start with blood. Just because you share a blood relation to this girl doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re her real family. It would be different if you had met this girl, if you were in her life prior to discovering the affair/her parents death, and then you cut her out - but it sounds like from her birth you all never considered her family. It\u2019s horribly sad, and I feel awful for that little girl, but at the end of the day she isn\u2019t your responsibility and you don\u2019t even know her, and she doesn\u2019t know you. The foster parents shouldn\u2019t have pushed, they should have read your sisters first message and respected that your family didn\u2019t want any contact.", "NTA - foster Mom didn't LISTEN when told the boundaries you and your siblings could live with and continued pressing her case in spite of that.  What was rude was continuing to pressure you guys when your sister politely explained.  I'm sure everyone feels bad for the young girl, but the sibs didn't create the situation, nor should they have to engage with the living proof of their father's betrayal and make nice. No, it's not her fault, but guess what? It isn't the siblings' fault either.", "Tell foster parents the following My father cheated on my mother. With Her SISTER. while she had CANCER. ME AND MY SIBLINGS DESPISE THESE PEOPLE. Would they like to tell their foster daughter that.  TELL THEM  you and your siblings have NOTHING POSITIVE to say about these people. The truth will ONLY cause your foster daughter pain. If they care about her you will no longer contact us again. That the only people being rude were them. That they got told politely to back off.", "This was almost an n a h, but her continued pushing made it an NTA.\n\nAfter both being ignored, and whatever answer your sister gave, the foster should have used common sense and figured out that there's a reason that none of the siblings, or any other family, took in your sister. \n\nThen, after you straight told her that you had nothing nice to say, and you had no good memories about her parents, she should have just left it alone.", "I have been thinking about this probably longer than is healthy and I am gonna have to go with ESH.\n\nTo start, obviously the foster parent shouldn't push something that will only hurt the child. They suck for that.\n\nHowever, I have read through your comments. I genuinely don't believe that 4 adult children do not know anything about their father and aunt or have any photos of either of them. \n\nYou said in one comment that you had him edited out of family photos... Thats... Really strange. Like where do you even get that done?\n\nYou have only talked about cheating on your mother, which is a terrible terrible thing, but you don't mention him doing anything else. Was he terrible to you all? The whole time?\n\nHonestly, you all seem to be actively trying to remove any record of him, written, digital and anecdotal as some sort of vengeance. You are taking that away from this girl. And so you suck for that too.", "NTA. \n\nShe is a paid foster parent so she will have a case worker.

Either this woman is unprofessional and shouldn\u2019t be a foster carer or someone who knows the situation has contacted you to push a relationship. \n\nEither way, nobody should be contacting you over Facebook to demand a relationship.", "NTA these people should have left you alone after you and your sister told them you had no intrest in having a relationship with your sister-cousin. You dont owe this STRANGER anything, you should follow your sister's lead and block these people (and possibly report them for harassment)", "NTA. Find out who the case worker is and inform them about what is going on and tell them to inform the foster parents if they contact you again you will be filing harassment charges. At the least they will move the child to a different family.", "NTA. \n\nContact the agency to report the foster parents harrassment.\n\nNo 4yo is going to be quizzing anyone about siblings they never met nor knew existed. What BS. Frankly, starting contact now would confuse the heck out of her and create more issues than it resolves. For this alone you need to report the foster in case they are telling that child she has siblings she did not know she had and creating some narrative that gives the poor child issues.\n\nYou and your siblings are young, barely adults, just beginning your lives, you have no moral obligation to a child whom you have not even met. Those folks rattling on about compassion clearly have no compassion for you and your siblings who have dealt with a lot of loss in your short lives. Have compassion for yourself and do what is best for you.", "Hmm, when I was a foster parent, if you wanted to make these sort of connections you did it through the social worker.\n\nAnd this is yet another \u2018all the older adults are dead\u2019 post.\n\nA bit suspicious.", "NTA you may be blood related but you are total strangers with nothing nice to say about this child\u2019s parents. of course she is innocent in all this but again, you\u2019re strangers, she will only know she \u201clost\u201d you if she is told.

As long as everyone\u2019s expectations are dialed to \u201clet\u2019s treat each other as distant cousins or something\u201d it can work out okay. \n\nIt\u2019s okay for you to not be interested, too. \n\nNTA.", "ESH \n\nFather and aunt made some awful choices that badly hurt OP and family. But no matter how bad he feels he was betrayed and how upset OP is, he is far better off than his half sister who is an orphan stuck in the foster system with no family. \n\nWas foster family out of line to be so pushy? Yes. But OP also doesn\u2019t want to consider his half sister at all - he can\u2019t even be big himself to call her that.

The first message to both of you I can understand. If the foster parent was never informed of the family history, it would make sense to her to try and reach out and help the girl through her grief with stories from family. \n\nHowever, the pushy and judgmental shit afterwards is too far. She has no idea what has gone on and is being a major AH by making assumptions, blaming you guys and name calling.", "I'm gonna go against the grain here and say YTA.\n\nI get that you're upset with your father and aunt for what they did. But the child is completely innocent in this. You're her family, and she needs you. Nothing you say or do will change this.

Common sense says that if a child comes into the care of a foster parent rather than being placed with any of four blood relations, there\u2019s a reason for it.

Second: When I was going through foster care training about 12 years ago, the class program explicitly spent a great deal of time (as in most of that evening) discussing how much better it is for the child to have people who are blood family to be involved in the child's upbringing. I don't remember their evidence, but it was pretty convincing. I assume the fosters have had similar training. I have little doubt that, all other things being equal, it WOULD INDEED be in the *child*'s best interest to be involved with blood fam. But all other things aren't equal here. You never knew the child, and have zero interest in helping raise the child--THAT's the big thing. Most of the time, it's the other way around: the FOSTERS don't want the blood parents involved. Your sitch is somewhat unusual, and I'd be inclined to just explain that you KNOW it would ordinarily be in the child's best interest for there to be an association there, but you never knew the kid and an association therefrom would be of no use to any of you.\n\nI would say that the fosters were trying to act in the child's best interest, but because of the details of the situation, that's just not going to work, and they don't seem to understand that. \n\nYou're def N T A, but at the same time, the fosters aren't coming from too far out of left field with their request. I don't think you need do any more than what you've done already, but if you feel like you need to do more, I believe you just need to lay out that you understand where they're coming from, but the answer is a hard no, and for damn good reason.", "Im gonna go against the grain here and say NAH, theyre trying to do a nice thing for a little girl who just lost her parents. If only all foster homes cared that much. I wouldnt hold it against them. However youve never had contact with her and have no kind stories of aunt or dad. I think its just a shitty situation.", "Oooof.  My family has been through this situation in a young relative\u2019s case, and it was harrowing all around.  They were about the same age as the OP\u2019s not-sister, and I remember clearly how terrified and intensely traumatized they were.  Fortunately our relationships with the deceased were a bit less traumatic than OP\u2019s, so we were able to find a home with family for them.  But even with us really, really wanting to help them, it was a  tremendously expensive and emotionally draining undertaking.  All of this to say that it would be too much to ask of OP\u2019s family to take them in, given the circumstances of the not-sister\u2019s birth.  It would be too hard for OP\u2019s family, and the odds of the not-sister never picking up on the family\u2019s resentment of their existence are slim to none.  That would be so damaging, so it is much better to have other caretakers for them.  \n\nBut I can also understand the foster parent\u2019s desperation, even if I really disapprove of their methods.  Four is such a vulnerable age, and it is scary to think how badly this could be going for her.  It\u2019s a tremendously lucky break that the not-sister ended up with a competent foster parent who seems really invested in taking care of them.  They seem to be grasping at any straws to find something to help this kid and answer their questions.  (Because at that age, and at that level of trauma, there are SO many questions.  And one of the most important things that you can do to help is to answer them as much as possible.)  WTHBS, the fosters need to understand that this is a very charged situation and that because of that, the bio family isn\u2019t going to be able to be involved.  \n\nIt would be a kindness if someone in the family who is further outside of the dad and aunt\u2019s blast radius than OP\u2019s family could contact the foster parents, explain the situation clearly and make it very clear that this is the only communication they will be getting from the bio family.  They could send over a medical history and try to anticipate the kind of things the foster parents would need to know to help the kid as they grew up.  \n\nI dunno man.  This is just rough all around and I feel for everyone besides OP\u2019s awful dad and aunt.  NAH, IMO.", "Oh. This is just sad all around. \n\nThis much be so much stress for all of you and you are all so young. \n\nI think the foster parents should have backed of when they had their answer. I also think you are only 18 and it is alot og pressure for you.\n\nI also feel for the young sister who has lost her parents. I honsetly hope that you in the future can put some of the hurt an pain behind you and give some information to the fosterparents.\n\nHave you siblings had any therapy or grief counsling? You really should look into that. Because it seams like you are all dealing with alot.\n\nNTA - but there is a short way to become one.

I'm gonna say NTA, but in the same breath I'm also gonna say you really could take the high road here.  Hell, you could even take the medium road and improve the situation.  I get that the situation sucks from your perspective and would never urge you to reconcile with your dead father or aunt.\n\nBut if I have the relationships right, this 4-year-old is both a half-sibling and cousin, which makes her awfully close, biologically speaking, to a full sibling.  Add to that that none of this is her fault or her doing.  The foster parents aren't the least bit wrong in saying she's an innocent.

Its uncertain what social services will do. She may be reprimanded and told to stop. Or the little girl may be removed from this woman's home. It's impossible to say whether the next home will be better or if this woman is a genuinely good parent who is misguided in this one specifically behaviour.

You have a lot of time, life and growing until that might happen. But I think it would be wise to have that in the back of your minds now, to allow it all to percolate over the years. It might also be a good idea in 10/12years to have a discussion with your siblings that she may contact you in the upcoming years. What you can tell her, what you don't want to, what amount you're willing to potentially her in your lives.\nKeep in mind that this kid didn't do anything to you, her parents did.

Whilst she wasn't born under the worst conditions imaginable, she was born to parents who were no contact with her closest living relatives due to bad blood. \n\nOnce they started to push *too* much, however, then they went right into asshole territory. It's great that they love this little girl that they want to champion for her as much as they can, but they need to accept they cannot force a relationship, especially among strangers.
