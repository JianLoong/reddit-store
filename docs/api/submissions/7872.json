Your pelvic region is not where you should test your tolerance for new body products in the future either.

Sorry! I misread your comment.  And now that I have reread it accurately,  I agree.", "Oh yeah, I meant Thibby was being one. It's just a word.", "The whole point I'm making is that the dude was \"offended\" by it. Weirded out... okay.... annoyed... sure.... grossed out... fine. But OFFENDED? I am 100% dude has heard a hell of a lot worse than that. \n\nI guess when it comes down to it, I just find it ridiculous when people get overly offended by a single word.", "lol me too", "Yes you may be right - but in my own opinion I think such things could be manifested if given the right thought process. I believe that one can manifest their greatest desires into existence - this is the absolute of the universe. Did we not get here through pure will alone?", "if someone told me their vulva was irritated i would probably throw up", "Greetings! Ivory soap is actually super drying, I wouldn't recommend using it on your genitals.  When washing your vulva, use cleansers only on the parts that grow hair.  Use only water on the inner labia and actual vaginal opening. Also avoid \"feminine washes\" and douches like the plague. \n\n-Your Friendly Neighborhood Gynecologist", "Seriously...like, unless you're talking to a medical professional and seeking treatment recommendations to make sure it's safe to use on your genitalia, no one needs to know that your soap gave you a genital rash specifically. Especially when you insist on using weird, euphemistic terms for it. You say \"I didn't like it, I think I must be allergic to something in it because it gave me a rash\".", "dont bring race into it. jus stop", "I totally disagree. If my friends were asking about a soap I would share that it irritated delicate parts of my body(sure as fuck not calling my vagina a \"squishy\" \ud83e\udd2e. But that absolutely is something I would share.", "Yep. First thing I thought was why do you want to be a drama queen by making unnecessary pronouncements about your vulva/vagina to your bf's friends? Maybe OP was under the impression that it was being unashamed of being a woman, and frank when it was just boorish oversharing. Your bf's pal doesn't want to know about your vulva/vagina. Why would he? \n\nMaybe the boys are immature but that she wouldn't even agree to not make his friend uncomfortable by not using that word? Oof. Besides which maybe that word has certain connotations to him. You don't know and it's none of your business. \n\nIf you're doing something that bothers people for no reason for no payoff (except attention and drama) and you lose nothing by stopping, why not just stop? It costs you nothing. YTA.", "But that doesn't make her an asshole though she's just lacking some tact", "Go further than that start calling it blue waffle. I'm sure he'll enjoy looking that one up.  \n\n\nMy youngest hates the word moist. My oldest got her one of them because there's one person you know that hates the word t-shirts.", ">I mean with the fact that they didn\u2019t know why this person left tells me they didn\u2019t exactly vocalize anything but rather exited abruptly and held up there side of their own limitations.\n\nYeah exactly he just stormed out because of what she called her OWN vagina... I fail to see how thats reasonable at all. \n\nI dont really see that insisting she stop is fair either, again it is her own - would it be fair if he insisted she cant say vagina? Fanny? Lady-parts? \"Squishy\" is particularly ridiculous but I dont see that this is a fair line to draw. Does OP get to decide what he can call his penis in return?", "The boyfriend obviously wasn\u2019t very thrilled about it either. I\u2019m not sure I would be offended, which sounds like OP\u2019s term instead of Thibby\u2019s, but I would be cringing head to toe at an adult saying that. I don\u2019t feel like someone is actually ready to be in a sexual relationship if they can\u2019t use the anatomical terms for their genitalia. \nI\u2019m also in the camp that cutsie terms pose a real danger because kids learn those instead of the proper terms and sexual abuse gets missed. I think that\u2019s a responsibility of all adults to promote proper or at least close enough to be unmistakable terms in society. \nSome of my children have had speech delays and that required some creativity on this issue because they couldn\u2019t say the proper terms for a long time. We taught our son the term \u201cpeepee\u201d because he could actually say that well before he could say \u201cpenis\u201d understandably. With a little boy we needed a term he could say when we talked about being careful zipping up. A lot of little kids need a closer but easier to say word for a while and you gradually teach the proper terms. Little girls have been ignored for saying that their brother touched their \u201ccookie\u201d or other weird terms. No adults should be promoting weird terms like this as shielding children from the worst forms of abuse is a responsibility shared by everyone in society. Plus a sexually active 26 year old should have the terms to communicate in medical situations too.", "WT actual Fuck are all judgmental \"adults\" think real actual people don't have any sense of humor and or couth to not say Penis or Vagina to mixed public company. Beside I have an 18 yr old daughter and called her woo hoo. She could have said lady parts but wow some prudes up in here. I'll take my Tommy wagger and go home.", "That's some deeply ingrained internal misogyny you've got there.", "The proper term for something would make you throw up? That doesn't make any sense,  especially knowing that you think the word squishy is acceptable.  Depending on the context of the conversation most people would have no idea what your supposed to be talking about.", "But that\u2019s what you did? You just used a euphemism, so they have to think the word instead of you saying it. Next time, don\u2019t bring up your vulva in social situations, and you won\u2019t have to deal with people\u2019s reactions to your cutesy nicknames.", "So you're saying it would be unreasonable for someone to call it that, and you would leave the room if someone said it? And it would probably be something you'd ask a partner to not call it that?", "You could have said it irritated my skin. No need to go into details that nobody really wanted or needed to know", "And using your own word for it is so much better?", "Why do proper anatomical terms make you so upset? YTA.", "yes bcs \u201csquishy\u201d is much better. are you 5??", "Why are you scared of a word for your own body part. YTA for this attitude alone.", "It\u2019s pronounced va jay jay", "I was trying to be brief (something I\u2019m bad at).", "The person you replied to isn't bringing race into the comments. Have you seriously never heard the phrase \"the pot calling the kettle black\"?\n\nIt's an idiom people use to describe people who are being hypocritical.\n\nBam! Just look up what the phrase means, it's that easy! The phrase has nothing to do with race.\n\nThe more you know!", "omg... this has got to be a joke right?", "I can\u2019t tell if you\u2019re being serious but that\u2019s just a saying. Zero to do with race.", "I knew the meaning in 6th grade. You\u2019re 26. take your own advice and grow up. YTA", "Lol that reminds me of a rather memorable birthday of mine. A friend bought a plus one (college roommate) to my birthday meal and guest spent the ENTIRE meal talking rather loudly...in the middle of a fancy Michelin starred eatery... about the things she had inserted into her SO's rectum the night before. Friend still doesn't understand why I no longer invite her to public venues...", "She's 26. Even if she's neurodiverse it's reasonable to expect her to understand not to bring up ALL of the details with people who aren't doctors, family or an SO", "N o please anything but the bloody blue waffle\u2026 Thibby wouldn\u2019t be able to come back from that one lmfao.", "Oh I agree, you\u2019re right. But I also just deleted my comment bc I had forgotten some of the things stated in the post. I don\u2019t think the boundary should be about the word - but I\u2019m sure it\u2019s reasonable that they just don\u2019t talk to them about their genitals? Idk. I think it\u2019s reasonable for someone just say I don\u2019t want to talk about your penis or vulva and leave it at that but the focus on the word is kind of like.. unnecessary", "I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m cracking up because *nothing* about your comment was brief", "I don't see what the big deal is, she just sounds kinda weird, not like an asshole", "I have a story that revolves around that phrase that still makes me smack my forehead.\n\n\nI worked with a sweet young kid. But way too sheltered to be friends with our group.\n\nOne night (we worked graveyard shift) someone threw out the phrase blue waffles.\n\nPoor little sheltered kid didn't ask what it was. \n\nAfter we clocked out we found him near the display of pokemon cards.\n\nHe told us he was looking for the blue waffle.\n\nI made the guy who mentioned it explain...I excused myself.to go laugh at home in private so as not to embarrass him further.", "I won\u2019t google bloody blue waffle, I won\u2019t google bloody blue waffle, I won\u2019t google\u2026", "I feel like the issue IS the word though, or at least thats how it seems from what OP is saying. Agreed that \"we dont talk about genitals with each other\" is a reasonable line to draw with your mates girlfriend. But I think this is specifically about the terminology. Could be wrong though im gonna reread in a min.", "i completely agree with you. the friend storming out of the place and norman breaking up with her over a silly word is, well, silly.", "She said, I quote, \"if someone told me their vulva was irritated i would probably throw up\". So she is fine telling others that but when its reciprocated it isn't? It can't be the wording since you're insinuating the same thing.\n\nIt seems like OP did the \"ditzy\" thing where you act like a kid because you think its cute, except they've done it so long its become a part of them? Anyway, OP seems very weird and either has the mental maturity of a 12 year old or is just stupid or purposefully did it to wind some buttons?\n\nEither way ESH, everyone here is the AH but it does seem like INFO since I doubt the BF would want a break solely because of the usage of a single word.", "If it's a one offe incident I agree, it's a silly reason to break up ... but I've got a feeling OP is leaving things out. Maybe this isn't the first time she's over shared to the point of causing ppl discomfort. Dunno about anyone else but if I knew every visit to a friend's place means I've got to hear about jock itch, anal discharge or vaginal itching I'd reach a breaking point too"]}
