Your pelvic region is not where you should test your tolerance for new body products in the future either.

She realized they used cookie for vagina. \n\nI didn\u2019t grow up using correct terminology, just \u201cprivate parts\u201d, but I\u2019m 100% teaching my kids the correct words because of stories like that.", "There are legit toys called \"squishmallows\" which my students love and bring to school. I would ABSOLUTELY assume they were talking about those.", "Exactly. Ask me about the little girl who told her mom that an adult cousin, \"...touched my cookie.\" He knew. \"Cookie\" was a family thing. He gave her a cookie every time.", "Holy crap! A rational comment. Everyone is being so childish over the term she used that I didn't think I'd be able to find a comment such as this. Bravo!", "God I just checked it out. Watch out men! The s-word is equivalent to racial slurs!", "Also in her comment history\u2026.. she says she likes how the soap smells and feels. So does she like it or not", "I see your point, I am just terribly confused about the entire situation", "Sorry, yeah, that makes sense. I meant for cleaning your scrotum. Like any soap will do, right.", "Yeah, nah I meant why is it soap for balls? Surely the scrotum can be cleaned with any soap.", "Bajingo", "I feel like we're being made unwilling participants in OP's ageplay kink.", "I also made the mistake of checking her post/comment history. Woof.\n\nI have to assume OP is on the spectrum and has additional cognitive impairments. They seem fixated on the Dr. Squatch brand in general and their comments/replies do not seem to line up with someone who is cognitively 26 years old.", ">2: Op openly talks about her genital problems to people who don\u2019t want to know, and won\u2019t agree to not use one random word to make people comfortable. The word isn\u2019t a big deal, but refusing to take a tiny step to show respect is.\n\nwell they asked about the soap. If a soap caused someone irritation in their genitalia and I specifically asked, I would like to know.   \nEspecially, because a lot of stuff that causes itchiness is usually because of other issues or can cause other issues.   \nSo the part of answering that the soap caused that issue is not bad, it can prevent him to give it to his gf/mother/sister....whoever.   \nIt is just as childish to be spooked to talk about genitalia as it is to call it weird names.", "It\u2019s definitely the infantilism. Ick", "See the below discussion, its not about not wanting to talk about genitalia full stop its about the specific being used. I just dont see that its a reasonable boundary to expect someone to change how they refer to their own body parts just because you dont like the word.", "Seriously horrific. Absolutely not. No.", "He was busy at another party, drinking and totally not taking advantage of intoxicated and/or terrified girls.", "Yet somehow \u201cThibby\u201d found himself a girl named Sydders. \u201csquishy\u201d is a terrible nickname for genitalia, but holy smokes what is with those names?!", "Haha", "Will do", "We had to call it our lady places.  Or boy bits.  Ugh.", "Ugh, those damned Oprah cults are out of control!", "Snooker \ud83e\udd23 sounds like some kind of kiss!", "For many years my mother would say \"don't strain your fuzzy guzzy\". She's older and has a lot of odd -isms that she uses in conversations, so I thought nothing of it, but I was fully an adult when I realized she was trying to say \"back off and let the boys/your dad handle that\". Scarred for life.", "That kind of story is exactly why my husband and I started teaching her the correct terms", "Yeah that comment was\u2026 a lot.", "Oh definitely. Join the club. We\u2019re all confused and grossed out.", "I mean it\u2019s still sensitive skin but you don\u2019t have to be as picky", "Oh yes normal soap for balls, but like don\u2019t put soap in your vulva it\u2019s bad for it.", "I would with my friends, but not my partner\u2019s friends. And I would certainly not be using the term \u201csquishy.\u201d In fact, it took me a second to even realize what she was referring to.", "Yeah, I would only buy OP going the \"unashamed woman\" route if she could actually say the word \"vagina\" - you know, the way an unashamed woman would.", "There was no drama till you peeps arrived, also why are you being such snowflakes about referring to genitals, the projection is a little overwhelming.", "And if OP indeed has one of those (I haven't read comment history) and \"Thibby\" is aware of that, the storming off could easily be less about the word and more about also being an unwilling participant.  \n\n\nAlthough that's a bunch of assumption on my part haha.", "Right? Also, did you see which specific soap they used? A \u201cblack sand heavy grit\u201d bar. Whyyyyy would you wash your vulva with something exfoliating?! There\u2019s no way that she is 26 years old and thought that was a sensible idea.", "Being childish isn\u2019t the red flag for #2. Lack of basic respect.", "It's not just a dislike of the word itself, but if the context. Hearing an adult talk like that makes me feel like I'm in an age-play scene. It's super fucking creepy.", "I have a feeling they are nicknames from OP. I\u2019m surprised there isn\u2019t a weird one for Norman.", "Bro what", "> wow some prudes up in here. \n\nIt's very prudish to clutch pearls over perfectly ordinary words like vulva, vagina, clitoris, penis, and testicles.", "This comment is wholly incoherent, congratulations.\n\nAdding: the implication that the words \u201cpenis\u201d or \u201cvagina\u201d are *uncouth* and not, you know, the actual literal names for those body parts screams \u201cI never received proper sex education.\u201d", "I genuinely do not know what side you are supporting", "I found out there\u2019s a card game called snooker.  It caught me by surprise hearing my in-laws saying they where going to their friend\u2019s house to play snooker.  I asked \u201cwhat?!\u201d  And my brother in law said \u201csnooker, you know, the card game.\u201d", "NOOOOOOO I just instinctively winced and crossed my legs. Holy shit. You\u2019re not even supposed to use anything other than WATER on your labia. BLACK SAND HEAVY GRIT???? No no. Nooooo. Someone needs to teach OP basic hygiene and proper terminology for her genitals. Ugh.", "To me, mentioning that it causes irritation in the vulva is not a lack of respect when asked about the soap if it did cause it. It would be disrespectful to actually knowing it causes that issue not saying anything.   \nIs not like bringing it out of the blue...  \nI do talk about these topics openly with friends but I won\u00b4t tell someone on the bus or a random at work \"you know that this soap irritates my vulva?\".", "Its in the context of talking about soap. If it were the boyfriend and it was about what is said during sex thats much more reasonable. Even asking her not to say it is fine but storming out and demanding she NEVER say it again is just a bit ridiculous. \n\nOP said in a comment (determining my verdict that she is also TA), that the word vulva makes her want to throw up... is that a reasonable boundary too?", "Norman IS the weird nickname. Real name is Bob.", "One can only hope.", "\u2018A weird one\u2019 for\u2026Norman?", "The irony of being disgusted by the actual body part names but finding it perfectly acceptable to say some shit like \u201cbeef curtains\u201d probably.", "Oh thanks for saying it was incoherent. I couldn\u2019t decide if I was having a stroke or just too damn high.", "I think the actual word in this case is vulva not vagina.", "I had to just look that up I\u2019ve never heard of that card game! That would have been so confusing as a kid!", "DONT.", "What heavy hands said.. DONT. DO. IT.", "\u201cOh *hon*\u201d is the meme that came to mind at your story.. Omg that poor child lmfao.", "You misunderstood. The lack of respect is not agreeing to say it again. The friend is being immature, but it still costs OP nothing to be polite. Except their relationship apparently. \n\nIf someone tells me \u201chey, that word makes me really uncomfortable , please avoid using it in the future\u201d, I\u2019m not going to refuse. Because I\u2019m not an ahole like op.", "No you\u2019re right to them they have hyper fixated on the word. Which is why I\u2019m thinking this is so ridiculous. Amongst all of it there is a reasonable boundary and not a one has found it haha", "He just acts and looks like a Norman", "Thats my favourite kind of high to be", "I was quoting the commenter I\u2019m replying to.", "I was confused as a 22 year old.  The only time I had heard the word was when my grandma used it to refer to female genitalia.  Lol", "I felt so bad that we defiled his perfectly innocent mind with THAT.\n\nI hope he's doing OK.\n\nAnd m sure we are a large part of whatever therapy he attends."]}
