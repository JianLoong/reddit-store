You\u2019re not, not even a little, but she won\u2019t change. That doesn\u2019t mean give up or anything! But you have some big decisions to make, and a very Frank sit down with her to schedule. Good luck!", "Thank you for that, I appreciate it!", "Especially don't buy a house with a hoarder.

If that's actually what's going on with her, it's a complicated thing that is not going to be fixed by (a) common sense (b) talking to her (c) legal discussions or anything else that might be do-able for you. If this is clinical hoarding, in order for her to get better, she has to understand that she has a problem and want to seek help. \n\nOverall, I don't think we have enough information here to know if your mother's actions are clinical hoarding, thoughtless and selfish (but non-clinical) clutter, or reasonable use of shared space.", "Yeah, we're looking to buy a house with my spouse with enough space for my MIL, but the plan isn't about her being on the property act ever!", "They are, to expect the mother to only keep stuff in her room. She owns part of the house too and has right to keep some stuff in shared spaces, just like they do.", "How about whatever she puts in shared spaces gets thrown in her room or tossed.
