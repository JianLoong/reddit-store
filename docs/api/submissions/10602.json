We already have 2 daughters and were really hoping for a son as we plan for this to be our last child. It has been a long-standing tradition in my family to wait and share the name of the baby with the family until they are born, but we've all thrown around names that we like during casual conversation.\n\nDuring a conversation about a year ago, my wife and I mentioned that we really like the name \"Tyson\" (using a fake here) for a boy. My sister in law and brother were both like \"wow, I actually really like that name too!\"...we thought nothing of it and just thought it was some validation that they generally liked a name that we potentially had in mind.\n\nFlash forward to the end of December, my brother and his wife welcomed a baby boy and decided to name him \"Tyson\" just 2 month before our son was due. My wife and I were really hurt to hear this initially and weren't sure what to do. We thought about changing the name of our son, but ultimately, we felt like he already had his name even before he was born...not to mention we already purchased signs, clothes, and all kinds of things that had his name printed and engraved.\n\nWe stuck to our guns and last week announced the name of our new son to our family that we had also named our son \"Tyson\". This did not go over well...and it still isn't going well unfortunately. My SIL and brother are outraged and saying it isn't right that we used the same name if they had already used it first. We told them we had our mind made up on the name even before we got pregnant, but they just can't seem to accept it. They are the only ones who haven't met him yet and say they are waiting to meet him in 2 weeks on my birthday (which is the next family get together)...\n\nMy parents and other siblings are also acting weird about the whole thing and it has been incredibly awkward introducing him to them in person. It just doesn't feel right and it's not like they are trying to make us feel crazy, but now we do. Ultimately, I feel like it's just a name, but did we just cause a lifetime of awkwardness for our son and nephew?

Just because they used it first does not mean they now have sole rights to said name. Ultimately, it IS just a name. The child is what makes the name special.\n\nNTA\n\nAlso they're cousins, they don't live together, so having the same name shouldn't impact their daily lives. Perhaps it may be confusing for them as small children at the first few family gatherings, but kids are smart, you can easily explain they're both named \"Tyson\" and they'll learn. Also, I'm sure everyone will eventually just use nicknames anyways.", "NTA. I have the same name as my cousin and we both turned out fine. I don\u2019t think our moms (who are sisters) made a big deal about it though. But I thought it was cool to have the same name as my older cousin.", "NTA \n\n>my wife and I mentioned that we really like the name \"Tyson\" (using a fake here) for a boy.\n\nThey knew you had a name already. They tried to use their kid being born first to claim it. \n\nDid they really expect you to say screw it, you called dibs? \n\nYou as parents have the choice to name your child, just like they do. If they don't like it, it's their problem.", "NTA, no one owns a name. It might be weird, but it is what it is. I would be super annoyed if one of my siblings named their baby the same name as one of my kids, but if we had had a prior discussion where that name had come up as a contender for one of my siblings and I still chose that name, that would be on me at that point. It\u2019s their fault that it\u2019s weird.", "NTA, they knew what they were doing. \nReddit is a fickle beast. Most of the posts I see along these lines everybody\u2019s says:\n\n \u201cwho cares!  name the baby what you want! they don\u2019t own it! \u2026. blah blah blah \u2026\n\nso I\u2019m a little surprised at the responses here. But you came up with the name first. They knew very well you were going to use it. They neglected to tell you that they were going to use it. Why should you give them the same courtesy? \nEverybody will get used to it or they won\u2019t. It\u2019s their loss if they choose to make it weird.", "NTA. It\u2019s a name. Heaps of people have the same names. All good.", "NTA, you already stated the name to your family while your wife was pregnant. They don't own that name and you have every right to use it.", "NTA!\n\nMaybe, they forgot the conversation or thought they'd claim the name before you could claim it. Seriously, George Foreman named his kids George. I guess your kids could be Tyson #1 and Tyson #2, or they could both come running when the name Tyson is called. Family members can pout, but the kids are already here and have been named.", "Look, NTA, honestly people blow these things *way* out of proportion. So there are two Tysons it's not the end of the world.\n\nYour brother and his wife are kinda the AH for using the name you'd chosen, but at the end of the day it's just a name. They're very much the AH for taking your name *then* acting all offended when you also used it. Either names have to be unique in a family - which I think is dumb - or they don't, but you can't just make up a rule that goes one way.\n\nEither way you'll be fine and you'll get over it. Things like this used to happen all the time before baby names became some kind of magical expression of parents' identity, and usually you just wind up with a nickname for one of the kids. There are plenty of cultures around the world where every other kid is named Muhammad and they managed just fine.", "NTA. You already had your heart set on the name. They were probably just hoping you\u2019d pick something else and that\u2019s on them.", "NTA. I fell victim to \"claim the name\" and semi-regretted it. The family member had a son, not a daughter, and claimed a girl's name that I had wanted first. I relented and picked a different name, but they only had a son and never had a daughter. Don't get me wrong, I love my Daughter's name, but a part of me is still regrets not just sticking with my first choice name.", "Wtf is this, an episode of Jerry Springer?! Nobody owns names. NTA.", "NTA\n\nWait till the brother learns there is about 40,00 people named Tyson in the US.", "NTA. Our fam jokes all the time about Big J and Little J, Big P and Little P. We have lots of same names. \n\nAlso if we really want to get down to a matter of who claimed it first- you threw it out as a name you liked and when they knew you were pregnant they should have realized it was likely going to be what you chose.", "NTA....nobody owns the name...and you decided on the name before them", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s a name. \n\nKids will probably just see each other on holidays. \n\nCall then Tye and Tys\n\nNot really difficult", "NTA. Your family can call the boys by their middle names, call them Tyson and Ty, Big and Little, 1 and 2, nickname them based on their interests when they get older and their interests develop-there\u2019s a lot of ways to verbally differentiate them.", "NTA \n\nWe have three people with the same name in my family. Unplanned. We all make it work. \nPeople don\u2019t have claim over names. Your family are being ridiculous. Hopefully they don\u2019t let a name tarnish their relationship with you and your kids.", "NTA you have every right to name your kid whatever you want. It may be something they can bond over later as they get older.", "NTA, they should have approached you guys and said we recall y\u2019all liking the name Tyson we also have it in our baby names. Maybe that way you guys could have potentially changed y\u2019all\u2019s list of baby names. Regardless no one can claim a name and it just kind of it is what it is at this point. They should get over it, it\u2019s not the babys fault well no one\u2019s fault for that matter. It is their nephew why put off meeting him.", "ESH, I guess?  Maybe your brother and his wife could have talked to you about the name before they chose it for the baby, maybe asked if you guys had your heart set on that name or something.\n\nAt the same time, no one has dibs on a name. That works both ways. They had the right to name their son Tyson and you had the right to name your son Tyson as well. \n\nBut it seems awkward to have two first cousins pretty much the same age with the same name. But whatever.", "NTA if the family has a good sense of humor.  \n\nTotally, OP and wife came up with and shared the name with the family.  Using it for your son should not have been a surprise.  Having your own brother pull this  probably was a surprise, to you?\n\nYou love the name, they love the name, oh well.  Of course there may be some confusion if the boys live in the same city, school district, neighborhood.  They'll get used to it. \n\nJust as there are dozens of people named Steven Tyler, Randy Jackson, Michelle Williams...\n\n[30 pairs of celebrities with the same name](https://www.buzzfeed.com/kristenharris1/famous-people-same-name)\n\nThey'll have a twin in name if not genetics.  This could happen with a stranger, names are not copyrighted.  They may not even remember they heard the name from OP and wife first.\n\nSigns, printed stuff, etc. can be donated, or given as a gift if you decide to change the name.  But OP and wife would always resent doing it, right?  \n\nEven if OP changed the name now (not suggesting that), would family change their opinions?", "ESH. They shouldn't have used the name,  but honestly,  once they did,  it's weird for you to use it too.  Second cousins you don't see often,  fine-- my parents actually gave me the same name as a second cousin I only met once,  and it was never an issue except that her mom once accidentally emailed me bc we had similar addresses. But a cousin you see often? Bc of your family rule, you knew your nephew had this name and they didn't know you were planning to give it to your son,  so you should have sucked it up and changed your name choice.", "ESH, this is unnecessairy confusing for the kids. You can keep a name secret OR be open about it but first one to name a child in a family DO get the name. My daughter has the same name as my brother's fiancee. He didn't meet her until our daughter was 6mo so this wasn't planned. Now that my brother is getting married I really hope she keeps her last name so they won't have the exact same name. \n\nYou could have used Tyson as a middle name and chosen another first name.", "They had the baby first. You don\u2019t own rights to the name before the baby is born, they have more say because their baby was out and alive and named Tyson FIRST. No matter how much you liked it. Now what you are doing is a temper tantrum and strange pouting. You are only making Tyson Number Two\u2019s life harder, for that YTA.", "ESH stealing someone's baby name who is close to you seriously sucks (don't waste your energy claiming no one owns a name potential commenter). However, unless the name holds a special meaning to yourself and your wife alone (as in not your brother) this wasn't the hill to cause your son to die on. Having said that I honestly don't know what I would do now - as the name is already registered. I think I'd stick with it tbh.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You've got Hector Abel (name + middle name), Bebo (nickname), Dami\u00e1n (middle name), Jos\u00e9 (middle name), Cano (nickname) and finally, Pap\u00e1 Hector (family patriarch, RIP). This sort of thing is not uncommon in my culture, everyone has at least one middle name and it's normal to name a kid after a parent or family member. No one bats an eyelid if there are lots of similar names in the family. \n\nSo don't sweat it, OP. Give your kid a middle name or two, or just let the kids nickname each other.

One of my closest friends, whose mother was a close friend of my moms, and who I treat as a cousin still, and I have the same name, spelled the same way.

Just work out some nicknames now. \n\nI was called by my first name, my first+middle names, or an unrelated animal nickname depending on the person. She had first name, shortened first name, and first+middle names. Since each adult had different names for us, we always knew who was being addressed based on context by age, like, three. \n\nSo yeah, I recommend calling them both first name+middle name when they're around each other for now.

With both of you having boys, it would have been nice for them to come to you with \"I know you had that as a possible name, but we really like it\".

I think the other folks are more TAH because they threw a fit. Maybe I should have voted n t a.
