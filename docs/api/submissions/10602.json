We already have 2 daughters and were really hoping for a son as we plan for this to be our last child. It has been a long-standing tradition in my family to wait and share the name of the baby with the family until they are born, but we've all thrown around names that we like during casual conversation.\n\nDuring a conversation about a year ago, my wife and I mentioned that we really like the name \"Tyson\" (using a fake here) for a boy. My sister in law and brother were both like \"wow, I actually really like that name too!\"...we thought nothing of it and just thought it was some validation that they generally liked a name that we potentially had in mind.\n\nFlash forward to the end of December, my brother and his wife welcomed a baby boy and decided to name him \"Tyson\" just 2 month before our son was due. My wife and I were really hurt to hear this initially and weren't sure what to do. We thought about changing the name of our son, but ultimately, we felt like he already had his name even before he was born...not to mention we already purchased signs, clothes, and all kinds of things that had his name printed and engraved.\n\nWe stuck to our guns and last week announced the name of our new son to our family that we had also named our son \"Tyson\". This did not go over well...and it still isn't going well unfortunately. My SIL and brother are outraged and saying it isn't right that we used the same name if they had already used it first. We told them we had our mind made up on the name even before we got pregnant, but they just can't seem to accept it. They are the only ones who haven't met him yet and say they are waiting to meet him in 2 weeks on my birthday (which is the next family get together)...\n\nMy parents and other siblings are also acting weird about the whole thing and it has been incredibly awkward introducing him to them in person. It just doesn't feel right and it's not like they are trying to make us feel crazy, but now we do.

So there are two Tysons it's not the end of the world.\n\nYour brother and his wife are kinda the AH for using the name you'd chosen, but at the end of the day it's just a name. They're very much the AH for taking your name *then* acting all offended when you also used it. Either names have to be unique in a family - which I think is dumb - or they don't, but you can't just make up a rule that goes one way.\n\nEither way you'll be fine and you'll get over it.

Otherwise they would of said something. \n\nI\u2019d also say \u201cdon\u2019t worry, when your sons old enough he\u2019ll know that you didn\u2019t care enough to find a name yourself and stole his cousins name\u201d", "NTA Tell them that you know exactly what they did, that they thought just because their child was born first they\u2019d get away with stealing the name you chose.

There\u2019s a female first name that three of my cousins have. We call them Big, Little, and Tiny Firstname.", "NTA and I am all here for it. They stole it from you. What did they expect to happen.", "why people share names before the baby is born and the ink on the birth certificate is dried, idk \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "They didn\u2019t really know very well that OP was going to use the name. Timeline indicates that OP\u2019s wife wasn\u2019t even pregnant at that point, let alone pregnant with a boy. OP said they threw out several names that they liked.\n\nBrother and SIL might not have even remembered where they heard the name by the time they named their kid.", "Also, you pitched the name first and it sounds like your brother knows it. NTA", "I have the same name as my aunt and we managed just fine even when i lived with her!", "Remembering the OP who told their copycat SIL the wrong --really stupid name--and then named the kid something else.  SIL's poor kid stuck with the stupid name", "My name is the same as my aunt's but I'm not named after her, but my mother who has it as a middle name. I grew up being called \"little ____\" and my aunt \"big _____\" and still to this day sometimes they will", "Yeah, you either don\u2019t talk names (and therefore don\u2019t give anyone any ideas they might end up loving) or you firmly claim a name and state your intention to use it if you ever get the chance. Odds are his brother and SIL didn\u2019t even remember where they heard the name until Tyson #2 was announced.", "All I\u2019m saying is know your audience. I would bet money that the brother and SIL have done shady, underhanded garbage in the past.", "In my family, we wait too. Mostly because nobody wants to hear everybodys opinion on the name. \n\nI even told the midwife, ~5 minutes before birth, that she'd have to wait like everybody else, when she asked what we'd name him \ud83d\ude04.", "And sometimes people can point out potential problems, like iffy initials or misspellings. I have a friend who is still salty that everybody pronounces her kid\u2019s middle name \u201cwrong.\u201d No\u2026 you spelled it wrong and now it\u2019s an entirely different name.", "Big fan of your husband!", "\"Its pronounced Ashley!!\"\n\nSpelling: Asche'leighe", "We had Maren, Mirren and Meryl on our list of potential names.  We had boys.", "YTA for your kid! Imagine having to grow up having similar name and being compared to each other in one way or another because their parents were too stubborn to give them a different name", "NTA... but if your son and nephew's names actually do end in -son, then you can always call them Tyson and Tynephew. Maybe not to brother and SIL's faces, though.\n\n(this is a joke and I will not be responsible for IRL consequences if you take me at face value. also everyone should feel free to apply this to any nephews they have whose names end in -son. you could possibly even have Madiniece, Addiniece, Alliniece, etc)", "Lots of cousins share the same name. My friend has the same first, middle and surname as his cousin. NTA.", "NTA- You went as far as to have things customized with his name why should you change his name you liked it first however them boys are going to go nuts being called by their names at the same time.", "I'd say YTA. You said you had this conversation \"about a year ago\" and just had your son now. Your son hadn't even been conceived. You can't expect people to keep track of every baby name you've ever mentioned you liked, and avoid them just in case it's the one you ended up picking. \n\nIt's not the end of the world for cousins to have the same name, but it's still a petty thing to do. Your brother and SIL didn't do anything wrong.", "OP and wife are NTA. The bro and SIL are also NTA for using the name \u201cTyson\u201d but they are AHs for getting mad about the new baby having the same name. Heck, the kids might even grow up and think it\u2019s cool!", "NTA. Nobody owns a name. It\u2019s senseless to argue that they stole the name from you or you stole the name from them. It\u2019s a name, everyone has one, lots of people have the same one. Pretend you don\u2019t notice the awkwardness and refuse to get drawn into discussions about it. Your son is \u201cTyson\u201d now, whether they like it or not. They\u2019ll just have to get used to it.", "YTA. Mentioning a name in passing and having no further communication doesn\u2019t lay claim to a name. Just building animosity for the sake of drama. Sure it\u2019s not the end of the world, but it\u2019s a dumb reason to stir the pot.", "NTA. To be fair, I also have about a dozen cousins named \"Mary\" or \"John\" (fake, but similar tone), so I may not be the best one to ask.", "NTA.\n\nCall their kid Tyson 2 from here on out lol.", "Knowing they like the name is not the same as saying \u201cwe are naming our kid x\u201d", "But what about Ee-yan Miller and his white bread family?", "I'm not Portuguese, but my home town in Massachusetts had a lot of Portuguese immigrants, mostly from the Azores. There were a number of families I knew where every girl's first name was Maria. The middle names would be different, so you'd have Maria Theresa, Maria Fatima, Maria Anna, and so on.", "I'm with you there. I figured the name would be announced AFTER birth.", "Well, Brother and SIL weren't an AH because they used the name.  It is not at all unusual for cousins to share a name. But they are now because they are having a tantrum and involving the rest of the family.", "And that was how pre-natal Natasha became Alexis after birth."]}
