We already have 2 daughters and were really hoping for a son as we plan for this to be our last child. It has been a long-standing tradition in my family to wait and share the name of the baby with the family until they are born, but we've all thrown around names that we like during casual conversation.\n\nDuring a conversation about a year ago, my wife and I mentioned that we really like the name \"Tyson\" (using a fake here) for a boy. My sister in law and brother were both like \"wow, I actually really like that name too!\"...we thought nothing of it and just thought it was some validation that they generally liked a name that we potentially had in mind.\n\nFlash forward to the end of December, my brother and his wife welcomed a baby boy and decided to name him \"Tyson\" just 2 month before our son was due. My wife and I were really hurt to hear this initially and weren't sure what to do. We thought about changing the name of our son, but ultimately, we felt like he already had his name even before he was born...not to mention we already purchased signs, clothes, and all kinds of things that had his name printed and engraved.\n\nWe stuck to our guns and last week announced the name of our new son to our family that we had also named our son \"Tyson\". This did not go over well...and it still isn't going well unfortunately. My SIL and brother are outraged and saying it isn't right that we used the same name if they had already used it first. We told them we had our mind made up on the name even before we got pregnant, but they just can't seem to accept it. They are the only ones who haven't met him yet and say they are waiting to meet him in 2 weeks on my birthday (which is the next family get together)...\n\nMy parents and other siblings are also acting weird about the whole thing and it has been incredibly awkward introducing him to them in person. It just doesn't feel right and it's not like they are trying to make us feel crazy, but now we do. Ultimately, I feel like it's just a name, but did we just cause a lifetime of awkwardness for our son and nephew?

So there are two Tysons it's not the end of the world.\n\nYour brother and his wife are kinda the AH for using the name you'd chosen, but at the end of the day it's just a name. They're very much the AH for taking your name *then* acting all offended when you also used it. Either names have to be unique in a family - which I think is dumb - or they don't, but you can't just make up a rule that goes one way.\n\nEither way you'll be fine and you'll get over it.

(I have a lot of cousins with the same name because it\u2019s their grandmother/great grandmothers name)", "INFO\n\nHow do you know they didn't also already had picked Tyson when you mentioned that name?", "I went to school with 27 Jennifers - 16 Jens, 10 Jennys and then there was her.\n\nNTA", "Just do the right thing. Cut the left ear to one baby and the right ear to the other. So you can call them Left Tyson and Carl.", "NTA", "NTA. No one owns a name. Not you or them.", "Esh \n\nMainly the both you and sil. You guys are gonna cause major confusion for both kids.", "Sorry but YTA. Fact of the matter is you didn't claim the name, you just thew it out as one of the options. I guarantee you you're family is gonna give your son a nickname soon bc this is dumb. You were second. Change his name.", "One day, the family can all explain to the first Tyson why his younger cousin has the same name as him.", "My Dad was from one of those \"Joseph, Mary, John\" families.  So many cousins with those names.", "There are so many \"Johns\" in my family and some of them are close in age its not that big of deal having people with the same name.", "I have two cousins with the same name as well, they're pretty common names anyhow (think something like dave or john) so yeah, it doesn't have to be an issue.", ">if they weren't sure, the sib& spouse could have asked too.  \n>  \n>Something like, *We really liked the name Tyson when you brought it up.  We are hoping you aren't too attached to it because we'd like to use it.*  \n>  \n>This couple absolutely thought they'd just use first born(not first conceived-name not fetus) as way to force OP to choose another name.", "Same in Ireland. I know of a family with eight Patricks.", "Ditto Greece. My Greek roommate shared her name with three first cousins, all named after Grandma.", "Reading some of the y T a comments, all I could think was that they obviously don\u2019t come from Irish families LOL", "+1. In addition to the mentioning other names too thing, I think many people are missing the timeline on this one. They had their baby *last week,* but he says he had the conversation *about a year ago.* It sounds like they weren\u2019t even pregnant at the time they \u201cclaimed\u201d the name.", "No one owns the name", "Neither does the brother because he used first. That's how life works.", "Nope. No one owns the name not OP and not the brother.", "Both sets of my biological grandparents are named Bob and barb. I have three cousins named Michelle - they go by Michelle, Mikki, and Shelly - Mikki and Michelle are pretty close to the same age. My brother and uncle are both named Mike, you can usually figure it out by context but when in doubt or talking about both of them, my little brother is Michael, not to be confused with my good friends Mikey and Mike, who both know my family and have been to family events. \n\nMy stepdad is named after his dad, my cousin is named after his dad, so two more sets of duplicates.   \n\n\nMidwestern white folks use names like they're depression era flour sacks, if it's still got some life left in it, no need to find a new one. If you want your kid to have a \"unique\" name, go for it, but you're going to have to work harder than picking something off the list of possibilities someone else started with", "It\u2019s James for my dads side lol. It\u2019s his first name and his younger brother\u2026 not sure what my grandmother was thinking..", "And patricia & paurig & padraig...and so so many paddys XD", "I claim the name JXIRjaDjuB I'm pretty sure I'll be the only person with that name", "My 3 cousins, 2 of which are twins, all have partners called Lucy.", "Waiting until the baby's there and already named cuts down on the amount of people who feel the need to share their unasked for opinions.", "People think it\u2019s up for discussion and sometimes steal the names.", "Because you might change your mind. \n\nWhen my daughter was born it was traumatic (she was close to dying twice in 3 days) and in all that my husband told his father that we were thinking about naming her Rose Mary, with Mary being the \"real\" name. Thinking, not decided yet. FIL gossips A LOT and told all his family that our daughters name was Mary. When all was good and she was out of danger we decided on Rose as her name. Family was pissed with us (!) because they bought stuff with Mary on. Well, husband said that we were thinking...\n\n(It took a while but my husband finaly understood why I don't want FIL to be told things unless we are ready to tell the whole world... )", "I was planning on calling my son Micah until my due date. In the two weeks between then and actually being born I decided I really didn\u2019t want to and came up with a whole new name ^_^", "Secrecy is fine too. And if they had gone that route they wouldn't be in this situation.\n\nBut they chose the worst middle ground of openly sharing the name they were choosing but pretending it was one of many options.", "Also what if you have a couple of names you like, decide on one and tell people X, then the baby comes and you decide they\u2019re more of a Y than an X after \u2018meeting\u2019 them", "This. We shared only with my best friend because I wasn\u2019t interested in anyone\u2019s opinion. And I still got comments about the pronunciation of my son\u2019s nickname (European pronunciation rather than American because my MIL is European). \n\nThem: I don\u2019t get it. \nMe: You don\u2019t have to get it, you just have pronounce his name correctly. \n\nOP, NTA. Whether or not they knew that was the name you\u2019d chosen, it\u2019s the name you chose. You discussed picking a different one and decided not to, nothing wrong with that.", "That happened with me. They hadn't told people, but my name was not in the running until I was born and it just seemed to suit."]}
