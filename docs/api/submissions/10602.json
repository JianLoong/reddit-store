We already have 2 daughters and were really hoping for a son as we plan for this to be our last child. It has been a long-standing tradition in my family to wait and share the name of the baby with the family until they are born, but we've all thrown around names that we like during casual conversation.\n\nDuring a conversation about a year ago, my wife and I mentioned that we really like the name \"Tyson\" (using a fake here) for a boy. My sister in law and brother were both like \"wow, I actually really like that name too!\"...we thought nothing of it and just thought it was some validation that they generally liked a name that we potentially had in mind.\n\nFlash forward to the end of December, my brother and his wife welcomed a baby boy and decided to name him \"Tyson\" just 2 month before our son was due. My wife and I were really hurt to hear this initially and weren't sure what to do. We thought about changing the name of our son, but ultimately, we felt like he already had his name even before he was born...not to mention we already purchased signs, clothes, and all kinds of things that had his name printed and engraved.\n\nWe stuck to our guns and last week announced the name of our new son to our family that we had also named our son \"Tyson\". This did not go over well...and it still isn't going well unfortunately. My SIL and brother are outraged and saying it isn't right that we used the same name if they had already used it first. We told them we had our mind made up on the name even before we got pregnant, but they just can't seem to accept it. They are the only ones who haven't met him yet and say they are waiting to meet him in 2 weeks on my birthday (which is the next family get together)...\n\nMy parents and other siblings are also acting weird about the whole thing and it has been incredibly awkward introducing him to them in person. It just doesn't feel right and it's not like they are trying to make us feel crazy, but now we do. Ultimately, I feel like it's just a name, but did we just cause a lifetime of awkwardness for our son and nephew?

So there are two Tysons it's not the end of the world.\n\nYour brother and his wife are kinda the AH for using the name you'd chosen, but at the end of the day it's just a name. They're very much the AH for taking your name *then* acting all offended when you also used it. Either names have to be unique in a family - which I think is dumb - or they don't, but you can't just make up a rule that goes one way.\n\nEither way you'll be fine and you'll get over it.
