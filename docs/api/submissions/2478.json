Has she been seen by a urogynecologist? I don\u2019t think this is a fair way to live for a 17 year old, just existing in diapers frequently. I\u2019m sure she felt embarrassed by your insistence, even if you were coming at it with the best intentions. I have a smaller bladder compared to what is normal (IC related) but issues of incontinence can actually be a sign of pelvic floor dysfunction/weakness and can be addressed sometimes through biofeedback, bladder training, and general pelvic pt. From your description it seems like every doc you take her to see just says \u201cyeah you got a small bladder nothing we can do\u201d and that\u2019s not okay. That\u2019s brushing her off.", "YTA for not pursuing more doctor's opinions to figure out what's going on here.", "YTA it is not normal for a teenager to be incontinent. Get another medical opinion.", "YOUR DAUGHTER NEEDS TO SEE A(NOTHER) MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL YES SHE IS A CHILD BUT SHE IS CLEARLY DEALING WITH A MEDICAL ISSUE THERE IS PLENTY OF PHYSICAL THERAPY THAT CAN HELP WITH THIS YOU NEED TO LOOK INTO PELVIC FLOOR THERAPY HER QUALITY OF LIFE IS BEING OVERLOOKED BECAUSE YOU REFUSED TO BELIEVE THERE WAS A PROBLEM OTHER THAN IT BEING AN INCONVENIENCE TO YOU. YTA", "INFO: Did you mean to say 7 year old and not 17 year old? I cannot fathom that a 17 year old would be okay wearing literal diapers when pads exist.", "YTA. Disneyland would make accommodations for this, such as escorting her to the front of the line or giving her a pass to \"save her spot\".\n\nI'm sure staff would understand if her parents held her spot while she went to the bathroom. \n\nIt sounds like you just wanted to find what was easiest for you, rather than in her favor.\n\nDid you even check with Disney to see if they'd accommodate you??\n\nETA: also a \"small bladder\" isn't really a thing. OPs child more than likely has overactive bladder which is a treatable problem and shows OP hasnt actually given a shit or gotten a second opinion if its just \"put diapers on and call it a day\". There is bladder time training, diet changes, kegals ect.  Overactive bladder can also be caused by neurological disorders, diabetes, UTI, tumors or bladder stones ect.\n\nBad parenting OP, do right by your child before you end up cut out.", "YTA \n\nWhy haven\u2019t you gone to another doctor or sought additional opinions?\n\nAsking her at 17 to wear diapers so you can go on rides at Disney is fucked up. Maybe instead of spending money on Disney you should\u2019ve spent it on healthcare for your child. \n\nOutrageous", "INFO- you say she has \"occasional\" accident and needs to urinate \"more frequently\".\n\nWhat exactly do you mean? Because the frequency of her accidents and her needing to go absolutely will determine if you are being reasonable or just an asshole.\n\nDoes she have an accident once every three months, or two ea day?\n\nCan she hold her bladder for two hours, or does she need to go every 20 minutes?\n\nOnce she has the urge to go, can she hold it for a 15 minute bathroom line, or does she only get a two minute warning that she has to pee??\n\nWhat was the actual likelihood of her having an accident at Disney?", "YTA for making your teenage daughter's bladder issues your responsibility at this point. Assuming she doesn't have any cognitive impairments and can make other decisions for herself, she's old enough to make that call and also potentially suffer the consequences if she has an accident and ends up having to tie a shirt around her waist and be miserable for half the day.", "I mean she's 17 being forced to wear a nappy/diaper. Couldn't she wear something a bit less degrading like a pantyliner for women if this is an issue.\n\nI think it's her body and her choice, she shouldn't be made to do or wear anything. She's nearly an adult. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Why didn\u2019t you bring her to another doctor ?? This is clearly not normal and most likely either an infection or a neurological issue. It\u2019s neglect to not look further into it.", "INFO: Did you ask to try it out on the first day and then re-assess if she needed to do so moving forward? Then Did she actually need them while in the long lines? I mean to say, did she actually urinate in them? If not, then YTA.", "YTA for letting it get to this point. \n\nA small bladder shouldn't cause poor bladder control unless she's constantly holding it in past the point of safety (also not great, people can die of that, see Tycho Brahe). \n\nTake her to the doctor to discuss pelvic floor exercises for better control AND to reinforce the idea that she needs to go as soon as she feels pressure before it becomes a major health issue.", "Yta low key sounds like abuse", "Info: have you yourself worn a diaper to know how it feels? Also, are there no bathrooms on the plane that you took? Also, what else does she have to carry around for hygiene sake?\n\nEdit: grammar", "YTA she\u2019s old enough to know to wear them in the parks or not that\u2019s her choice. You forced her to do so. \n\nHighly recommend getting her some pelvic floor physical therapy to help with the bladder issue", "YTA. ~~First of all, you need more medical opnions. She's basically an adult, this sounds way beyond having a small bladder.~~ Also, as her parent you should have done more research and given more forethought into how to deal with this issue while on vacation instead of springing this on her when arriving. You probably knew she wouldn't like this and that's why you waited tbh. \n\nSecondly, since you're already there and there's not much fix medically speaking at this point, but tomorrow when you get to the park go to guest services at the front of the park ask them about DAS (its disability services). They'll ask a couple of questions and she should tell them she has medical bladder issues and can't wait in long lines as she frequently needs the restroom and cannot hold it. Assuming they approve you, they'll give her a DAS pass and show her how to use it. It basically allows her to get return times for rides and only wait 5-10 min in an actual line instead of waiting in line the entire time.\n\nEdit: I saw your comment about having been to specialists, you should probably edit the post to say this. However, YTA still, a 10 minute google search before your trip into Disney's disabilities services would have fixed the problem.", "Poise liners were made for this issue. Much more discrete. \nMild YTA", "INFO.  Do you mean adult diapers?  Or baby pull ups?", "ESH, maybe these would be better. https://knix.com/collections/incontinence-underwear", "YTA do you mean actual pull ups or adult style liners? \n\n>she agreed to wear her pull ups on the plane ride it was 4 hours long and she's been known to wet in her sleep so it wasn't a big deal,\n\nShe could have an issue in 4 hours and the doctors say nothing is wrong?\n\nYou said she has occasional accidents. No ride line is 4 hours long even at Disney. Why would she need to wear pull ups?! Even if she did there are so many age appropriate options.", "Yta you are aware planes have toilets?   And there are many toilets at Disney.  Go to the bathroom before getting in line. \n\nAlso, you've taken her to a doctor, correct???????", "At that age and as so many here have pointed out, trauma in her past could be the issue but I promise it won't be you that she talks to about it, as you have compounded the possible trauma with even more by having her wear pull ups instead of seeking another answer. \nThere are medications she can take, therapy, both physical and mental health, and DW can help with accommodations. \nYTA.", "YTA\n\nYou need a second medical opinion; this is not normal, even for a small bladder. Pull-ups are not a good solution at all and extremely embarrassing for a teenager. This should have been properly addressed ages ago and is simply coming to a head now\n\nSee different doctors, and multiple until someone actually can find a source and solution. Make sure gynecologists are among them because pelvic floor issues cannot be ruled out\n\nDismissal of medical issues among women, kids, and teenagers are common. It's on you to be aggressive about this", "YTA. \n\nYour daughter is 17, she's nearly an adult, she needs to learn how to manage this by herself either independently or with the help of a medical professional.", "Holy shit, this is sickening. YTA and hopefully when she turns 18 she leaves and never speaks to you again", "Clearly this is a big deal to her. If she didn't want to wear them, you shouldn't have forced her. She is almost an adult. YTA.", "NTA from your point of view, but this sounds wholly demeaning for your daughter and is probably crushing her confidence. I don't buy the 'she just has a small bladder and wets herself' that's not normal. I hope she goes to a consultant and gets it looked at properly.", "I think the answer comes down to what your overall relationship is. If you can afford it some family therapy sessions for the two of you on this topic would be helpful. \n\nYour request is reasonable but she clearly feels shame or the way you went about discussing it with her made her feel shame. This is going to be a lifelong condition she's going to have to learn how to manage. \n\nShe's at the age where she should have been thinking about that on her own and possibly making that decision for herself ahead of time or with gentle encouragement from you. Maybe next time you can ask her to think about what her plan will be because the lines will be quite long and she won't be able to excuse yourself and let her come up with it herself.", "ESH? What is her other option? Like is she willing to miss out on rides with the family? What if she did have an accident or two? Is she okay walking around in soiled clothes or carrying them all day? What about panty liners for bladder issues?", "Yta. By the way they are called briefs. You refer to them as briefs for adults. Not pull ups. Also they make adult briefs. You should also goto another Dr.", "NAH. But you need to take her to a therapist and a pelvic floor physio. Your doctor is the AH though", "NTA. I read your comment about her having a medical condition. Has the doctor provided any other options. It's a shame but this is for the best. She won't stand a chance against those lines at Disney world. Unless you can get the staff to assist, I can't imagine what else can be done. The poor thing would be just wetting herself all day.", "YTA - sounds like you wanted convenience rather than respecting your child's wishes. Can she hold her bladder roughly an hour? Then she could go prior to getting in each line and be fine. There are bathrooms everywhere", "Um?\n\nNTA \n\nWhat if she peed on the ride, others would have to clean it up or worse not know it's there and sit on her pee. Your daughter is very unfortunate to have to deal with this, but she knows her limits. Please get more than one doctor's opinion if you haven't already", "I want to clarify a few things. These are not baby diapers these are the same good night's she wears at night, for those for you saying it's not normal for a teen to have occasional accidents, it is more normal than you think, she's been to many doctors and specialists, she has a smaller bladder than average for girls her size it is a condition that has lead to embarrassment for her in the past, it's is not due to abuse it is a medical condition.", "NTA. Next time let her use her own judgment so she can piss all over herself and ruin her day herself.", "NTA, i mean probably she wouln\\`t have spoken to you if she peed herself either (because you didn\\`t think of a way to help her). You tried to help her and maybe if you talk to her about it, she will understand.\n\nI do get why she may feel embarassed tho, its not a fun thing to wear", "NTA. PPl on these comments suck. It's either she wears the pull-ups or she's not gonna be able to ride any rides because she'll always have to leave to go to the bathroom and even then I bet there are lines for the bathroom too. ALSO I'm sure she wouldn't be too keen about her family going and enjoying themselves while she has to wait for the bathroom constantly. It just makes sense. Plus she wears them anyway and had no problem wearing it on the plane. Why is it an issue now?
