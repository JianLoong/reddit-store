I have a smaller bladder compared to what is normal (IC related) but issues of incontinence can actually be a sign of pelvic floor dysfunction/weakness and can be addressed sometimes through biofeedback, bladder training, and general pelvic pt.

She's basically an adult, this sounds way beyond having a small bladder.~~ Also, as her parent you should have done more research and given more forethought into how to deal with this issue while on vacation instead of springing this on her when arriving. You probably knew she wouldn't like this and that's why you waited tbh. \n\nSecondly, since you're already there and there's not much fix medically speaking at this point, but tomorrow when you get to the park go to guest services at the front of the park ask them about DAS (its disability services). They'll ask a couple of questions and she should tell them she has medical bladder issues and can't wait in long lines as she frequently needs the restroom and cannot hold it. Assuming they approve you, they'll give her a DAS pass and show her how to use it. It basically allows her to get return times for rides and only wait 5-10 min in an actual line instead of waiting in line the entire time.\n\nEdit: I saw your comment about having been to specialists, you should probably edit the post to say this.

If you can afford it some family therapy sessions for the two of you on this topic would be helpful. \n\nYour request is reasonable but she clearly feels shame or the way you went about discussing it with her made her feel shame. This is going to be a lifelong condition she's going to have to learn how to manage. \n\nShe's at the age where she should have been thinking about that on her own and possibly making that decision for herself ahead of time or with gentle encouragement from you.

The poor thing would be just wetting herself all day.", "YTA - sounds like you wanted convenience rather than respecting your child's wishes. Can she hold her bladder roughly an hour? Then she could go prior to getting in each line and be fine. There are bathrooms everywhere", "Um?\n\nNTA \n\nWhat if she peed on the ride, others would have to clean it up or worse not know it's there and sit on her pee.

These are not baby diapers these are the same good night's she wears at night, for those for you saying it's not normal for a teen to have occasional accidents, it is more normal than you think, she's been to many doctors and specialists, she has a smaller bladder than average for girls her size it is a condition that has lead to embarrassment for her in the past, it's is not due to abuse it is a medical condition.", "NTA. Next time let her use her own judgment so she can piss all over herself and ruin her day herself.", "NTA, i mean probably she wouln\\`t have spoken to you if she peed herself either (because you didn\\`t think of a way to help her). You tried to help her and maybe if you talk to her about it, she will understand.\n\nI do get why she may feel embarassed tho, its not a fun thing to wear", "NTA. PPl on these comments suck. It's either she wears the pull-ups or she's not gonna be able to ride any rides because she'll always have to leave to go to the bathroom and even then I bet there are lines for the bathroom too. ALSO I'm sure she wouldn't be too keen about her family going and enjoying themselves while she has to wait for the bathroom constantly. It just makes sense.

Mostly at night but some at school too which humiliated her. She was tested numerous times for UTIs but the tests always came back normal. She has a few bladder tests with full then empty bladder ultrasound, watching her empty using some kind of machine, and some others. All normal. It made no sense to me. Because she has the symptoms of a UTI on a regular basis we tried cranberry juice. Boy did that make it worse. Next time we brought her in for a UTI test I got a look at the previous results. Their version of \u201cnormal\u201d results meant no bacteria or white blood cells. They completely ignored and didn\u2019t bother telling me there were red blood cells in it. Doctor dismissed it completely. I asked for the reports from all the scans. Their version of \u201cnormal\u201d included thickening of the bladder wall. I know everyone says not to go to google for medical research but that\u2019s what I did with her specific results, including cranberry making it worse. Bingo, got my answer. Searched for a urologist doctor who had experience with less common conditions and got the referral. Sent here file down. I didn\u2019t say what I expected. When we got there he asked her questions about her symptoms then asked us if we had ever heard of cystitis. Yup, that\u2019s what I thought it was. Cranberry is the absolute most common trigger of her particular type. He did give her a couple other referrals just to rule out a few other possible causes of some of the results though he felt it unlikely that anything would come off those tests; better safe than sorry though. It was interstitial cystitis.\n\nMy point in sharing this is that even though you\u2019ve seen lots of doctors, you should get copies of the test results and read through them.
