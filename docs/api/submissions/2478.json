I have a smaller bladder compared to what is normal (IC related) but issues of incontinence can actually be a sign of pelvic floor dysfunction/weakness and can be addressed sometimes through biofeedback, bladder training, and general pelvic pt.

She's basically an adult, this sounds way beyond having a small bladder.~~ Also, as her parent you should have done more research and given more forethought into how to deal with this issue while on vacation instead of springing this on her when arriving. You probably knew she wouldn't like this and that's why you waited tbh. \n\nSecondly, since you're already there and there's not much fix medically speaking at this point, but tomorrow when you get to the park go to guest services at the front of the park ask them about DAS (its disability services). They'll ask a couple of questions and she should tell them she has medical bladder issues and can't wait in long lines as she frequently needs the restroom and cannot hold it. Assuming they approve you, they'll give her a DAS pass and show her how to use it. It basically allows her to get return times for rides and only wait 5-10 min in an actual line instead of waiting in line the entire time.\n\nEdit: I saw your comment about having been to specialists, you should probably edit the post to say this.

If you can afford it some family therapy sessions for the two of you on this topic would be helpful. \n\nYour request is reasonable but she clearly feels shame or the way you went about discussing it with her made her feel shame. This is going to be a lifelong condition she's going to have to learn how to manage. \n\nShe's at the age where she should have been thinking about that on her own and possibly making that decision for herself ahead of time or with gentle encouragement from you.

The poor thing would be just wetting herself all day.", "YTA - sounds like you wanted convenience rather than respecting your child's wishes. Can she hold her bladder roughly an hour? Then she could go prior to getting in each line and be fine. There are bathrooms everywhere", "Um?\n\nNTA \n\nWhat if she peed on the ride, others would have to clean it up or worse not know it's there and sit on her pee.

These are not baby diapers these are the same good night's she wears at night, for those for you saying it's not normal for a teen to have occasional accidents, it is more normal than you think, she's been to many doctors and specialists, she has a smaller bladder than average for girls her size it is a condition that has lead to embarrassment for her in the past, it's is not due to abuse it is a medical condition.", "NTA. Next time let her use her own judgment so she can piss all over herself and ruin her day herself.", "NTA, i mean probably she wouln\\`t have spoken to you if she peed herself either (because you didn\\`t think of a way to help her). You tried to help her and maybe if you talk to her about it, she will understand.\n\nI do get why she may feel embarassed tho, its not a fun thing to wear", "NTA. PPl on these comments suck. It's either she wears the pull-ups or she's not gonna be able to ride any rides because she'll always have to leave to go to the bathroom and even then I bet there are lines for the bathroom too. ALSO I'm sure she wouldn't be too keen about her family going and enjoying themselves while she has to wait for the bathroom constantly. It just makes sense.

This should have been discussed during the planning so she was prepared to either wear pull-ups or you had a plan on what to do.\n\n Also, there are also alternatives to pull-ups, there are pads designed specifically for incontinence and some menstrual underwear can also work for this. Do better for her.", "YTA\n\nYou force your nearly adult daughter to wear pull-ups for toddlers. That alone is abuse. Something is not right in your head.

They made adult diapers, panty liners and even underwear to accommodate issues like this, but your lackadaisical approach to seeking medical help for your daughter about all of this makes me question whether you even bothered to look into that. Have you been to the same doctor many times? Many different doctors? It's well documented that women are less likely to be believed about their symptoms in hospitals, and the chances of that happening skyrocket if the woman is plus sized or a POC. If you went to the same doctor over and over, why would you expect anything to change between visits?

I 100% agree with you. I hated wearing pull ups even when I was a little kid at the appropriate age to be wearing pull ups. If my parents had tried to force me into them as a teenager I probably would've lost my shit. Unless this poor girl is pissing like a full bladder amount of pee every time she has an accident, there is really no reason she has to be in freaking pull ups/diapers/whatever.

Pelvic floor exercises don\u2019t fix everything. I would imagine her Dr would know more about her condition than an angry stranger on the internet.", "THAT WAS NOT HER QUESTION.
