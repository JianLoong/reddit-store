We are not religious and don't go to church. Our child (7f) has a summer birthday and this year asked if she could have a pool party with family and friends from school (male and female).\n\nMy husband mentioned to his parents that we are planning a pool party and they immediately mentioned that we have to implement the restrictions they placed on their kids for swimming...girls wearing long sleeves and swimming skirts, no male and females swimming together even if related, a partition put around the pool to block the swimmers from view. They said that nobody in the family would be able to come and participate if these measures aren't taken because it's inappropriate and they would be taking part in leading others to sin. They would also like for their preacher to be invited to the party.\n\nThis is extremely impractical for many reasons and I refuse to entertain any of these ideas, but my husband is waffling because of ingrained conditioning and approval seeking as he's the only sibling to turn from their religion. They expect unrelated guests to also conform to these standards and his sister has been sending me links to appropriate swimwear for the girls invited and saying we can just ask that instead of gifts parents purchase these for their daughters to wear. His father and brother have offered to put up the partition as their gift to my daughter. My mother-in-law has offered to make swimwear for those who can't afford it as a gift to my daughter.\n\nHis entire family keeps sending us biblical quotes about modesty and not leading people astray. My husband is wearing down and wants to try to compromise, arguing that following these guidelines isn't going to hurt anyone while I say that it's an unreasonable expectation. Children should be able to just have fun and a party where all of the kids can't play together is weird and defeats the purpose. It's also unreasonable to expect guests to comply and our daughter will pay the price because she won't have friends show up. If we can't compromise he wants to tell our daughter she needs to pick a non-swimming party because his mom and grandma are calling him crying that we will be excluding them if they can't come and they're only asking a few things.

If I got an invitation for my child to attend this type of party with modesty rules, I am assuming you're trying to recruit my child into your religion so I am declining and distancing myself from any non-required social interaction with you. I am glad for my child and myself to have relationships with people of all religious backgrounds so long as our normal daily interactions don't include you pushing religious beliefs on me. Dress codes in the pool are too far. I'll wear modest clothes inside your home or house of worship, but I am not forcing my kid into swim clothes for the comfort of others, even if she generally wears long sleeves to limit sun exposure. \n\nIf you want to protect your family from being assumed to be over the top and cultish in your life, don't combine the family and friends for the party. The risk is that people will feel like you're forcing beliefs on them which is not a good look if that isn't even your religion.", "NTA.

Sometimes gracious hosts make reasonable accommodations, like serving a vegetarian entree, to help their guests feel more comfortable and welcome. Dictating the dress of unrelated minor children at a pool party is not a reasonable accommodation. In fact, it would have the effect of putting off the guests who are not religious.\n\nIf you and your husband want to celebrate your child\u2019s birthday with his family, you can make alternative plans for that\u2014perhaps a cookout or cake at grandma\u2019s house.
