You don't have the relationship you want with your mother, quit putting more emotion and effort into the project. She's leaving, let that be the end of it.", "NTA she kicked you out for her boyfriend, even if you were doing the same thing back, it would be fair.

Has she any redeeming features?", "NTA\n\nA mother who left her daughter at age eleven and charged her rent at age 16 to live with her? The same mother who kicked her out because of the whims of boyfriends? WTF? Now she\u2019s been living rent free for TWO years? She definitely needs to pay up. The fact that she\u2019s bad mouthing you around town is the icing on this turd cake. Sorry OP.", "NTA.  Frankly, she's lucky that you've let her live there for two years before asking for rent.  Let her move out, it sounds like your life will be easier with her elsewhere anyway.  As far as karma goes, she's right...and it sounds like you've got some good things coming your way, and she'll have to deal with hers.", "NTA she fucked you over for her boyfriend so you should be able to fuck her over for this", "NTA\n\nLet her go, but probably that poor cat will have a better life with you. Keep it.", "NTA - My horrible mother did the same to me. After living with me rent free for a year. I asked for $300 a month just to help cover utilities. I was killing myself working 60+ hours a week to keep my head above water.  I was called greedy & selfish and bad mouthed to anyone and everyone. She ended up moving out when I was at work. She helped herself to a good bit of stuff (towels, dishes, pots/pans) too. Found out she rented herself an 1800 month apartment. She had no issues paying but just didn\u2019t want to pay me. Haven\u2019t spoken to or seen her since then. I hope I never do again.", "NTA.\n\nShe charged you rent as a child. You can 100% expect her to do the same as an adult.", "NTA, let her leave and don't invite her back.  Your true friends know what's up and if others believe her without asking for your side then you don't need their toxicity in your life anyway.  Good luck.", "NTA. Let her go and close that door forever. I\u2019m so sorry you have such a selfish horrible mom :(", "Also, congratulations on getting through all those bad experiences. I hope you now lead happier days without people who were supposed to protect you. \n\nIm rooting for you.", "NTA. my mom did something very similar to me last year and I had to just let it be whatever she said to everyone and do what was best for myself. \n\nI hope she leaves and that you get some work soon. My family is all contractors so I know all too well what you're feeling. \n\nBut you're not the asshole!", "NTA. \n\nTrust that people definitely know your mom is an AH. \n\nWhen she says, \u201cshe kicked me out,\u201d they\u2019re likely rolling their eyes and wishing that they could terminate their interaction with her. \n\nShe\u2019s seeking to be the victim. If anyone is treating her as such, they\u2019re just lying to make it through that awful convo with her and move on with their lives.", "NTA.

Seems like the other way round.", "I also have an awful mother. You\u2019re better off cutting her out of your life. I know it\u2019s hard, but take this as the expensive lesson on what she thinks of you.  You\u2019re there to serve her, and when you don\u2019t, she ditches you. Sounds like has all your life. \n\nBe free. Don\u2019t waste energy on her, and what she tells people. People that listen to her, and take her for her word, aren\u2019t worth your time. Anyone else already knows how she is.", "Don't worry about what this woman is telling people. It sounds as though anyone who knows her, including her cat, is likely well aware that she is selfish and heartless and that you are not at fault for her need to find new housing.  \nI'm very sorry that you have this person for a parent.  May you find peace and healing in letting her go.  NTA", "NTA - it might be best to just cut ties and have her move into her own place.  You and your daughter can get your lives back on track and not have to worry about the mess that your mom apparently brings to the table.", "What you should do is actually kick her out, and tell everyone it's because she refuses to contribute to the household.
