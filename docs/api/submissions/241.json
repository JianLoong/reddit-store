I think we had a good relationship, she has a son (11m). My girlfriend and I were good friends for a few years, we met through a mutual friends and so I haven\u2019t spent time with her alone until 5 months ago.\n\nI knew she had a son, because she\u2019s posted about him on Facebook, a few times. He has some sort of liver condition and was awaiting a liver transplant. its just him and his mom.\nI don\u2019t know much about him, as my gf Is very reserved talking about her son.\n\nI have a little sister (26f). I have always been closer to her than other siblings, considering we\u2019re only a few years apart.  when she was 11, we were fighting at school and she ended up fainting. She had to stay in the hospital for a few days to have some tests done, and she ended up being diagnosed with diabetes, not related to her death. \n\nI think it changed the dynamic of our relationship a lot, because she was in hospital a lot more than other kids.\n\nAt the start of September, my gfs son started getting sicker, and it was the first time she ever opened up to me about his health conditions.\n\nIn early October my  sister got into an accident. It was very sudden, and because she still lives near my parents they were heartbroken, and they don\u2019t have any children apart from my sister and I, so I went to help them.\n\nI Grew up in Australia, and my sister and my family still live there, I live in America currently. For the funeral and to console my mum and dad, I decided to stay there for 10days to help plan the funeral.\n\nOn my second day there, I got a call from my gf. She said her son had passed away during the night, I tried to help her the best I could even though I was already sad about the death of my sister. She said she wanted the funeral to be done soon, and that it would happen on the 6th day of my ten day trip. My sisters funeral was on the 8th and I wasn\u2019t going to take two flights to there and two flights back in less than 2 days to go to both.\n\nMy gf got really upset, and said that I didn\u2019t care about her son, and I was upset at her too becuase i had just lost my sister. She told me that her son thought of me like a dad, and I\u2019d never met him so I told her I didn\u2019t think of him like a son. She hung up angrily and we haven\u2019t spoken since.\n\nI\u2019ll admit I was harsh telling her, and a grieving mother didn\u2019t deserve that, however I don\u2019t think I was wrong to push the idea of me being this kids dad.\n\nAll my mutual friends think I\u2019m the A-hole for not going, and that I should\u2019ve told her later, but she knows I\u2019ve never met her son, and I wouldn\u2019t ditch my sisters funeral to go to her sons. My friends though think I did the right thing and I wasn\u2019t obligated to go to his funeral.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I should\u2019ve done, I\u2019m glad I went to my sisters funeral but I feel bad for how I told my gf as her sons never had a father figure in his life.\n\nEdit: thank you all for these kind words, I\u2019m very glad for all the support on this. I have read lots of comment before, however I\u2019ve been waiting to give you an update on my and my gf.\n\nMy gf and I aren\u2019t together anymore, I\u2019ve cut ties with her, not out of spite as some of the earlier comments said, but because I don\u2019t think seither of us are ready, we are both grieving important people in our lives now. \n\nI have heard from a freind of a freind(also a mutual freind who\u2019s not that close) who\u2019s friends with my ex gf she is still very upset and angry at me for my comment that \u2018he\u2019s not my son\u2019 and so I haven\u2019t spoken to a lot of my more distant mutual friends. A lot of them have been friends with my ex gf for years and have heard lots about her son, whereas not much about my sister as it was so sudden, so are still upset at me for not going, so I haven\u2019t spoken to them much either.\n\nSorry if there is a lot more waffling in this, because I don\u2019t have a character count.", "created_utc": 1667121005, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yh9ss6/aita_for_not_going_to_my_girlfriends_sons_funeral/", "score": 9077, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You never met her son (reasonable for the timeframe), and have an incredibly valid reason for not being able to be there for your gf at the time (a funeral of a close family member on the other side of the planet).\n\nThis is the end of your relationship, which may be for the best as it does sound as though you're not able to comfort each other in these difficult times. That's okay. Find the people who can comfort you, and who need your comfort, and move forward dealing with your own grief. She has to do the same. I can't call her an AH for it, but her calling you this boy's father was out of line (given that you've dated 2 months and haven't met him). She'll be wrapped up in her grief for a while, and her vision of a future with you may honestly just get in the way. If you want any closure, send a condolence card, but let this all go.", "Definitely NTA. Your sister had just died as well. You were there to grieve and support your parents.

You've been dating for 2 months, never met her son, and she expected you to skip your sisters funeral.  Yeah, you probably shouldn't have said what you did, but she was out of line telling you that her son thought of you as a father, you hadn't met, so unless she had spun some fantasy to her son she was just trying to emotionally manipulate you and make you pick who was more important.  Of course she would be devastated losing her son, but that was an AH move on her part.\n\nThere's also no way logistically that you could have gone to both funerals with the time differences and crossing the international date line, plus it would have cost you around another 3-4K in airfares with the way they are at the moment.

To expect you to jump on a full day of flights just because she wants to do her sons service quickly and ignore your feelings and situation completely for someone you\u2019ve never met and your two month relationship is outrageous!\n\nNTA, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss and for everyone giving you shit for it!

But 100 years ago people frequently lost children, go back further you might have been lucky if any of your children survived to adulthood, a disruption of the natural order of life and despite historical precedent a great tragedy.\n\nAnother natural order of life is that your siblings are your cradle to grave people, the ones who are supposed to be with you for the whole of your life journey. Friendships and lovers come and go, your parents had 20+ years before you existed and your children (should) outlive you by a similar margin. Some of those relationships will be more important that the ones with your siblings but you will have no longer lasting relationship in your life than your siblings. Your siblings are your true lifelong companions and the loss of one them with a disproportionate amount of life not shared impacts greatly.\n\nShe does not have a greater claim on grief, at this point in time with these events you are both hurting profoundly but anyone saying her pain is worse is wrong.

However yes telling her that he was not a son to you at that specific time might\u2019ve been a bit harsh.

Just because general American public is fine with embalming and prefers it doesn't mean every single person does it  *and* that even if they do, that embalming surely leads to a funeral being months later.\n\nMy great-grandmother might have as easily (well, no) emigrated to US and have her children there. Her location wouldn't change her family's funerary practices. So no, I'm not speaking from my perspective. I'm using my perspective as an example that a lot of people don't put a loved one in a fridge for many months.", "That was definitely a good crew. Most of them have moved on to better jobs. I miss them but I'm very happy for them.", "She knew he was going to be gone several days.  If she really wanted him there, she could have the funeral when he gets back.", "I was just questioning the commenter's indication that it was about what the mother needed and that she won't be able to forgive op for not being there, as though her attitude was justified", "This applies to OP, too. Would it even have been possible to fly back and forth for him? If this is even a real story. Seems sus to me.", "Not necessarily, if he was there primarily to support the mother. Lots of ex-couples get along just fine, including not minding their former partner's new partners because they just don't care who their ex dates by now.", "That would make sense. Overall I did find OP's train of thought hard to follow so thanks for clarifying this bit... As for who is the AH, OP NTA obviously but this relationship is all sorts of red flags especially this early on so run.", "Except we\u2019re talking about HIS grief and his GFs grief, not his parents.", "Embalming and refrigreation to postpone funerals are themselves funeral customs.", "I mean, the cremation can be done right away.  Bodies can be put in a freezer and/or embalmed (super common in the US).", "Depending on her religious tradition, maybe.  But delaying the funeral by a significant amount of time is also torture.  And what she really probably needed was him there by her side for all of it, not just the day of the funeral.  The days after a tragic death are all a shit show, not just the one where the person's body is laid to rest.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if it's justified, it just is. Humans are irrational, emotional creatures and it is extremely difficult to logic away feelings of hurt and betrayal.", "The difference is that OP did not express a need for her to be there for his sister\u2019s funeral.", "True. I guess in my head it would just seem strange for such a brand new relationship to be there when they have so very little to do with the kid if both parents and sides of family are there", "And he was there to support his parents grieving for their child. In addition to grieving his sister."]}
