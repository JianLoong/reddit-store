Now my issuie is anytime my sister is home I can't leave my door unlocked even to go to the toliet or to shower because she will come in and steal things. She recently stole my favorite prefume  and used it to de stink her shoes, she gave me back the empty can very smugly telling me that our  mum had bought her a full can of said spray and i better not steal it. Anyway my mum has gotten mad at me that I always have my door locked even if I'm in my room or not (they don't knock and will barge in) and is saying I need to keep my room unlocked more, but I know my sister will go through my things (even adult things she isn't meant to see and yes she has taken those things from my room) if i leave it unlocked and uninhibited for 2 minutes.

The bigger question is why are they not addressing the fact your sister is a thief.  The idea you can\u2019t leave your room to go to the bathroom is ridiculous and if they don\u2019t get her behavior in check this will go bad.  She will do this to others.", "NTA. It sounds like you are being pretty reasonable here. It's not that you want the door locked, rather it's that you don't want your sister stealing your stuff. If your mom can solve the theft problem (and why can't she?), it sounds like you would be fine with leaving the door unlocked.", "NTA. Doesn\u2019t matter if she\u2019s autistic, your parents are enabling your sister\u2019s poor behavior. If the locks are causing problems I would start hiding literally everything in my room. Maybe by a lock box and hide everything in there. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having to go through that", "NTA.\n\nYour parents are enabling your sister and punishing you for it. They are aware she constantly steals from you but won\u2019t let you lock your door to prevent said theft? \n\n>I\u2019m buying a lock and I\u2019ll give you a key\n\nWhy are you giving her a key when she will most likely unlock your door when you\u2019re gone?", "You need to move out as soon as possible. NTA in the meantime.", "NTA and your sister sounds entitled to your things. It may also seem like she's the golden child. Mom really doesn't ha e grounds to be mad despite it being her home because she can still access your room if she needs to (mom still has a key, right?)\n\nBoundaries are important and they absolutely need to be established.", "NTA, it\u2019s not very fair your parents are making you responsible for handling your sisters behaviour. That\u2019s really not your job, I under stand there is nuance too it, but if that\u2019s the solution that\u2019s the solution.", "It may be time to get out on your own.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister is.\n\nAnd your parents are. \n\nThey need to address the fact that your sister is a thief. If they don\u2019t they\u2019ll be taking it up with the police in a few years.", "NTA but it sounds like there is a lot more going on here than locking your door. It sounds like your family had been a very traumatic environment for a long time, given your and your brothers mental health problems. \n\nIt is also tricky because the lock will be exacerbating your agoraphobia, restricting you not just to inside a house but locked inside a room. I can see the difficulty with moving out, both financial and psychological, but I do wonder if some of the MH issues would reduce if you weren\u2019t living in fear all the time. It sounds like the hideous old psychological experiment where they locked dogs in cages and shocked them, and then even when the cage opened the dogs were too traumatised to leave.\n\nHowever, it is totally the only practical answer to your problem to lock the door.", "NTA - but why are you 21 and still living with them? It seems like a horrible living situation all around, and your family seems pretty toxic based on your comments in the thread. Can you get a job and get an apartment?", "NTA. But I do think you need to get another lock so that your folks have a spare key.\n\nI\u2019m not going to suggest you move out, but you may have to recognize that you\u2019re the only one out of your siblings who can be the adult here. You may have to be more proactive about tolerating your sister\u2019s behavior and trying to help keep the peace with your mom if you continue to live in the family home. If your sister is stealing something that isn\u2019t of much consequence, you might have to just let it go. My sisters and I stole from each other constantly and the only remedy was all of us having our own locks. We did try to keep our doors unlocked while we were home.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

First off, you are 21 years old, a full grown adult, you are allowed to have privacy in your own home. Secondly, your parents need to learn boundaries, what if you were changing when they barge in? Finally, they are showing clear favoritism to your sister, why are they pinning this on you, but not addressing the fact that she is stealing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA: Your sister definitely stole the second key from your mother, and is it possible to move out, you shouldn't have to deal with this", "NTA your 21 nobody has any business in your room unless you say so. That includes your mother", "I means she does , she is going to a special school now but honestly I dont think it's helping, she seems to have gotten worse and she will hit people she feels close enough to and just be cruel verbally to kids she talks to (obviously she is verbally cruel to us as well to the point where we had to call an ambulance for my mum because she had a panic attack so bad we thought she was dying, and my mum is a tough woman)", "My sister has severe autism and has had that diagnoses since she was 5 , to be honest My mum never wanted another kid and my sister held her back from her goals of finally going to uni or getting a degree and she put her into child care at 1 and my sister was abused, I think my mum blames herself for that . she has never been the strictest parent but I think she treated my sister super special due to guilt and my sister getting a early diagnosis", "We started with lock boxes but my sister will just grab anything, she has stolen my phone  off the kitchen counter while i cook many timesand will try and pin it on my brother by hiding said phone in his room.

My sister once emptied out 3/4th of a 20 dollar face scrub that she took from my shower so she could make \"shower slime\" and she got no punishment and my mum stood up for her. I find it ridiculous that I have to take my dripping wet body wash and face cleanser  back into my room after I shower just so my sister doesn't go into my shower take them and waste them. Me and my brother can get along and talk more then me and her and he still thinks Andrew Tate did nothing wrong (I'm hoping that's just a 16 Yr old being 16 ) . Idk maybe an 8 year difference is the real issue", "We bought lockboxes due to my insistence on a lock for my door,  they didn't work as my sister will just take anything she finds cool and i can't hide my while room in a box", "My parents do pay rent , all the bills and my phone bill though,  I only contribute 180 a fortnight", "Your mom didn't lose the 2nd key. Your sister has it.

You need a new lock, one where you do NOT give anyone else a key.\n\nChange the locks, and make it clear that your mother must replace the things your sister steals or destroys, as well as the cost of both locks. You should at least be entitled to take the value of these things-- make a list-- out of your rent payment until it is paid off.  How your mother gets the value back from your sister is her business, but she is the parent of a thief, and is responsible for the damages her daughter causes.\n\nThe solution is for your mother to parent her children.\n\nGood luck with the agoraphobia.

I had to put a deadbolt lock on my bedroom door at 18 when my brother 16 at the time decided to start stealing my stuff.

Drawers/chest/etc, as well as the door?  That way the door isn't locked, and your stuff is safe.", "Sounds like you need to move out.", "If your mom has lost the second key, she won\u2019t know if you change the lock. So go buy a new lock in case your sister stole the second key,  **don\u2019t** give your mom *this* lock\u2019s second key, then tell your mom to use her key if she needs to enter your room. Then lock your door at all times, whether you are in the room or not, and never, ever bring anything out of your room you won\u2019t mind getting stolen. Work on your mental health, save up money, and the moment you have a stable housing situation, tell your mom you will **never** be your sister\u2019s caretaker when she is gone, so she needs to figure something out that doesn\u2019t require you for when she is too old to care for your sister."]}
