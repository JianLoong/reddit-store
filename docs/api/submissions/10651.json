{"id": 10651, "submission_id": "1198yvw", "title": "WIBTA for refusing to raise my brother\u2019s kids?", "selftext": "When I (F20) was six, my parents died. Since my brother \u201cAlan\u201d was of age (he was 19), he became my legal guardian. \n\nHe dumped me at a foster home a couple of months after the funeral and disappeared and that\u2019s where I stayed until my aunt found me. (Added for context: my extended family offered to be both our legal guardians. Grandparents, aunts, uncles. The thing is: the trust stated that a % out of our trust would be given to our legal guardians to help raise us. Alan was older than 18 so nothing would go out of his trust. As I was 6, it was estimated that 30% out of my trust would go to my legal guardian. Alan stuck around long enough to claim my 30% and dumped me. Didn\u2019t bother telling the family that offered to keep me, just dropped me off one day and never came back. My family tracked him to down to Vegas & forced him to tell the family where he left me. And that\u2019s when I ended up with my current aunt. Some people have sympathy for my brother but please remember; 1. He NEVER needed to be my legal guardian. Family members offered to step up, he just wanted more money. 2. When he got what he wanted, he didn\u2019t tell the people that did want me where I was. Just disappeared. I have forgiven him for that but he is not the victim here. Alan is a terrible person and being 19 doesn\u2019t justify that.)\n\nHe didn\u2019t bother reaching out until one day when I was 9, when he brought his 2 year old daughter to my aunt\u2019s house and disappeared again. I am very close with her. She knows I\u2019m her aunt but we consider each other sisters. \n\nWhen I turned 18, I got access to my trust. I also got a house in Amsterdam, which is where I was born and raised until my parents passed.\n\nI travelled to see the house mid 2022 and I loved it so i decided to move back there. I didn\u2019t want to be separated from \u201cMia\u201d (niece/sister, F13) so I moved with my whole family (Mia, aunt and uncle). \n\nMy brother found out I\u2019m back in Amsterdam. He is now poor as he spent all his money on stupid things. He has been reaching out nonstop asking for money and I ignore him.  Then he came to my house with his wife and three children. \n\nMy brother says it\u2019s mean of me to only take care of one of his children and not the rest. I told him to get a job but he said he has a criminal record and his wife is disabled. He wants a monthly allowance to support his family and to share the house with them as they live poorly.\n\nThe truth is, I feel nothing for him. He is not my family, Mia and my aunt and uncle are. \n\nYesterday I was out and my aunt called saying he left his kids outside our house. I don\u2019t want them in my house or my life. I feel nothing for them. Mia is also very uncomfortable with them in the house and says she doesn\u2019t want to have to help raise them and she doesn\u2019t consider them siblings. \n\nMy conscience won\u2019t let me abandon them at a foster home like my brother did to me and my aunt and uncle are now retired and very old (63 & 64) and aren\u2019t able to run after them (they\u2019re young kids; 9, 7 and 4) but I don\u2019t want to put my life on hold to raise strangers.\n\nThe police are looking for my brother and his wife. If they don\u2019t find them, I will look for a nice facility to take them in. I have tried to find it in me to raise them but I just can\u2019t. I cannot imagine putting my life on hold to stay home and play mother with them. Mia doesn\u2019t want them in her life. I\u2019ve retired my aunt and uncle and they spend their days feeding ducks in the park and it is unfair to them to raise more kids that aren\u2019t their own. \n\n(Added for context: I turned 20 just 2 weeks ago. I am a caretaker to a teenager and two elderly people. Adding 3 young kids on top of all that + my education would literally kill me. \n\nBeing their primary caregiver means I have to step up and be a parent. And I\u2019m still being parented! What I\u2019ve decided is that I\u2019ll make an effort to be in these kids lives. I honestly don\u2019t expect my brother and his wife to turn up and if they do, I want them arrested. These kids are better off without them. I will look for a flexible situation where I will be able to visit these kids, take them out on day trips, maybe even have them over at my house for some nights. \n\nFor now, I have a lot of money and I expect my income to increase once I figure out how to make it work for me at an accelerated level. I will set aside some money for them, as I will for Mia, to give them a nest egg. I will make a conscious effort to be in these kids lives. \n\nMy aunt and uncle can\u2019t help bc, as I mentioned, I retired them. I refuse to let them raise more kids. They were amazing parents to Mia and I (still are!) and I want them to enjoy their old age and live life.\n\nThese kids\u2019 mom is not Mia\u2019s birth mom. I also have zero idea who she is. Met her only once when I was ambushed by them outside my house and she barely spoke.\n\nAs for the kids, I\u2019ve been talking to the 9 and 7 year old. My brother and his wife are shitty parents. They\u2019re all boys and would be left to fend for themselves for days on end. I\u2019ve talked to the oldest two and explained I can\u2019t take them in. I have promised them I will be there for them and they can call me if they need anything and I will come. They semi-understand. I\u2019m in contact with a female cop who understands the situation and is helping me navigate everything. There\u2019s institutions set in place for instances like mine. I\u2019ve decided to have the kids for about a week so I can get to know them and they can get to know me. I remember how sad and hopeless I was at that foster home and I won\u2019t let them feel like that. I\u2019m taking them shopping for some new items, I\u2019ll be visiting facilities and homes to see how they are, I\u2019ll give the eldest a phone so he can call me and I\u2019ll do my best to be the fun auntie. I got their mother\u2019s name from them and they say their grandma from her side is a sweetheart so we\u2019ll explore that avenue as well.\n\nAs for Mia, I\u2019ve talked to her and explained that she doesn\u2019t have an obligation to be their half-sister as I don\u2019t have an obligation to be their aunt. But I won\u2019t go against the values I was raised with and I\u2019ll do my part. She understands, and still wants nothing to do with them. She\u2019s young so I understand where she\u2019s coming from. For now, she\u2019s avoiding the kids.)\n\nI\u2019ve discussed this with my three cousins (kids to my aunt and uncle). 2 of them say I have no duty to these kids and my feelings are valid. 1 says I\u2019m the AH here as it\u2019s my duty to step up and raise them, the same way her parents did. \n\n(Added context: I told this cousin her parents took me in when they were 49 and I was just ONE child. We haven\u2019t spoken since but hopefully that will give her some perspective. On another note, my other 2 cousins know of my plan and will fly to Amsterdam at some point (maybe Christmas time) to meet the kids. They\u2019ve also sent some money to take the kids out, get some new stuff. It\u2019s very sweet of them but we were, after all, raised by the same set of parents.) \n\nSo WIBTA if I refuse to raise them?", "created_utc": 1677094106, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1198yvw/wibta_for_refusing_to_raise_my_brothers_kids/", "score": 1588, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother will probably lose custody and the kids will be put into a foster home.

Surface level you might consider those similar scenarios, but it's clearly quite different for a single 20 year old to care for 3 young children when she's in college and already caring for a 13 year old than for two 40-somethings to care for one older child when they already have experience raising children. \n\nAlso, she's specifically saying she'll stay in their lives while they're cared for in the foster system.
