Hard as it is you already have one of his kids that you love.  This man dumped you without even telling relatives what he did.  Let\u2019s face, this man and his family are no more than strangers to you. I\u2019m sorry and sad for them, but it is not your duty to raise them.  Hope the police find those losers.", "NTA. \n\nI'm here though for all the posts screaming Y T A, because, \"wErE fAmIlY\" or some other nonsense.", "NTA.\n\n>1 says I\u2019m the AH here as it\u2019s my duty to step up and raise them, the same way her parents did.\n\nSounds like she's offering to step up.  If she isn't then she needs to keep her mouth shut.\n\nYour brother abandoned you and his older daughter.  You owe him and his family nothing.", "NTA nope nope nope honestly if you have your brother\u2019s contact info or his wife\u2019s contact info I will tell him I\u2019m returning the favor that you gave me and putting your kids in foster care see if he returns or call he probably will. Even if he doesn\u2019t I will just give the police the children it\u2019s not your responsibility I feel sorry for the kids but they\u2019re not your responsibility. and if you don\u2019t handle it like this how do you know they\u2019re not gonna keep sending kids your way. And I will get some cameras for your house ASAP.", "Your brother abandoned you when he was 19, and now it seems that you are doing the same to his children. I know it\u2019s not your fault or responsibility, but the kids are innocent as well.", "Especially if she cares for the children, he will just pop out more children and bring them to her. This will never stop. They aren't her responsibility. And she will just resent them since she was forced to care for them in this way by someone she doesn't even have any family bonds anymore. \n\nNTA And OP, please call the police if you ever hear from your brother. Maybe give him a \"I will give you money, but just if you meet with me one last time to talk\" and then if he fall for it, inform the police about it.", "NTA\n\nAlso, I'm Dutch. Foster care in The Netherlands is nothing like the horror stories from the US. It's called kinderbescherming (child protection). The police can help you to get in touch with them and with social service. (Don't forget the Netherlands is a welfare state.) Let them take care of the children. And it's no problem to be in touch with the children while they are in the state's care.\n\nYour brother is trying to manipulate you.

However, the trust stipulated that whoever would be our guardians was entitled to 30% from each of our portions to help raise us. My brother declined their offer and kept me until he was able to get the 30% from my trust. Then he put me into the system and left. My family had to track him down to Vegas and force him to tell them where he left me. And I\u2019m not mad at him. I forgave him a long time ago. And another difference is that I\u2019ll make an effort to be in these kids lives. This is the second time I\u2019ve met them so I barely know them but I don\u2019t want them to feel abandoned in case my brother and his wife don\u2019t turn up. I\u2019ve researched some group homes with flexible policies so I can visit and take them out for the day or have them spend a night at the house. I\u2019ll make an effort to be someone who they can depend on. I can also afford to set aside some money for them. Right now, I have a teen and two elderly people depending on me. I\u2019m unable to handle 3 young children as well, when I just left my teen years a few weeks ago. Maybe when I get older and more stable, I\u2019ll take them in permanently. So no, I don\u2019t blame my brother. But I am not him as well.", "I won\u2019t abandon them. I\u2019m a caretaker to a teenager, two elderly people and I just turned 20 two weeks ago. Adding 3 young kids on top of all that + my education would literally kill me. And I barely know them - this is the second time I\u2019ve met them. I have researched flexible group homes that will let me visit them and take them out for the day or have sleepovers at the house. I can afford to set aside some money for them so I will do that as well. I\u2019ll make an effort to be someone they can rely on but I just can\u2019t give them what kids at that age need . But I\u2019ll do my best to at least be the one family member they know they can rely on. As for my brother, he kept me long enough to be eligible for 30% of my trust as my legal guardian and abandoned me despite my extended family members telling him they wouldn\u2019t mind raising me. All he wanted was the money. I\u2019m interested in the well-being of my nieces and nephews.", "Wow, this reads like an attack. I don\u2019t mean for it to come off that way, sorry!", "Ywnbta.

I'm sorry you are having to deal with difficult decisions like this.  But you need to take care of you first. This is not selfish.  Your brother and SIL are being extremely selfish.
