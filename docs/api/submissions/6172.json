Help them find a rental.  Call an Uber.  They've been there way too long.\n\n3.) If your in-law's continue to bug you about this insufferably, whether or not their insurance covers housing, first have a talk with your wife explaining that you don't want them there any longer so you'll have a united front.

Lets say there are 3 of us taking turns speaking, my uncle will be mid sentance speaking to him, dad just turns away and starts a new conversation with you.

The technology today is so amazing, her hearing aids come with an app that she can use to adjust to better hear background noise, something like telling her phone notifications, when the batteries are low, etc. I think they even have smart capabilities that can connect to a doorbell or her tv if she ever decides to buy those features! \n\nHell, I'm only 26 and I want a pair of my own", "My mom was the exact same way as your MIL. She would force me to drink a large glass of milk every morning before school from kindergarten to the day I moved out at 18 - despite the doctor telling her not to give me milk due to extreme lactose intolerance. Like I would throw up an hour after drinking milk EVERYDAY and she never thought it was the milk even though the doctors literally told her that it was. \n\nStarting in highschool I realized it was definitely milk making me sick and instead of fighting her on it, I would just pour it down the drain when she wasn't looking (I know this is wasteful and I still feel guilty about it, but I was so tired of throwing up everyday). She would smugly say \"see you can drink milk\" when I didn't have any tummy issues hours later. Honestly I have no idea wtf was going on in her head...", "You just changed my life with this comment. My husband likes to watch Twitch streams during work hours, and I don't always want to listen to them. I could have been watching my shows with headphones this whole time!!!!!", "Harbor freight has them for about $10", "My TV has 2 options. Plug a headphone jack into the BT remote, or audio pass through the Roku remote control app on your phone. Not to mention the many other 3rd party solutions", "Most tvs from the last 3-4 years have Bluetooth built in, no additional parts necessary", "I am visually impaired and the nightbird sort. I haven't ever been unable to adapt to the needs of others both as guests in my home or as a guest. If they can't use subtitles? Use headphones. I have issues using those for medical reasons but I also can do other things. Also do they not have phones? Why do they need a tv for YouTube? I love using the tv for it because I can make out more details but I can just use my phone. \n\nOP you could try standing in the kids room and recording the noise. Give your wife evidence. Your word and that of your children should be enough but since it's not? Take evidence. This is something I learned from my abusive parents that has served me well. Document everything. The gaslighting my parents did wasn't effective because I kept track of their lies and promises. This falls into that category. Not gaslighting but lies and promises. Her parents promise they need this and cannot somehow use their phones. They're lying. So prove it. They will get angry about this but what does it teach your children about their needs to continue on as you have been? Why is their health secondary to Grandpa's need for YouTube?", "The wireless headset is awesome. \n\nI worked nights for years and as a consequence had trouble sleeping at night when I retired. The wireless headphones let me watch TV at night while not waking up my husband. I use them now to listen to whatever I want to and do work in the house.", "Send him links to book a hotel room.", "This is excellent but do not forget the welfare of your children. The kids will back you up on the noise. NTA", "Why should OP be responsible for coming up with and buying this?\n\nThe FIL is the one that has a problem, he should be exclusively trying to fix his problem to be able to watch his precious YouTube again.", "I have one hooked into my old LCD 720P TV for the exact purpose of not waking my kid.\n\nHell, back in the '00 when wireless was a newer thing I had a set of headphones that plugged into the audio jack of an old Plasma TV.\n\nThere are definitely options without having to replace the whole TV", "Exactly! Have these people never heard of laptop streaming?", "And don't be the one to buy headphones like a couple of others suggested. Let THEM be out that expense.", "My husband likes to watch the late night football games but prefers to watch the last half in bed. So we recently bought an iPad because even on mute the brightness from a tv in the bedroom would keep me awake. I wish we\u2019d done it a long time ago!", "Let them buy their own headphones.", "He's still be watching tv after the kids go to bed at 8:30 though surely?", "My one gets up sometimes at 5 am, one time he was coughing so bad I got up and got him meds, when I came in it was 3am and he had fully dressed himself like since he was up coughing that ment it was time to get up. I let him sleep in and took his sister to school. My husband texted me while in the car line that he was completely fine and talking his head off.", "an even if FIL medicaly can not wear headphones HE IS SHIT OUT OF LUCK", "That\u2019s freaking adorable. I love how they really become little people once they become toddlers. That said though, I really do miss the happy squealy baby my son was. He was ridiculously happy like 85% of the time. Now he will sass me (which is alarming the first time, or it was for me \ud83d\ude05"]}
