I told him he can do it before work or on his days off or it's tough shit.\n\nHe complained to my wife who's now taking his side and saying that the kids need to learn how to sleep through \"a bit of everyday noise\".\n\nI told her it's not everyday noise and that he and MIL are being excessively noisy and inconsiderate, she's just not there to see it.

They suck.", "NTA honestly though I would take it off just so you can get videos of proof then turn the controls back on lol", "NTA\n\nMIL, FIL, and wife are all ah's. Not only is your wife the ah for siding with her father, but for insinuating that her children basically need to suck it up. She should be advocating for her children.

Show your wife if she still disagrees, hide the remote.", "NTA - it's pretty selfish of your IL to disturb your kids sleep.\nIf they're hard of hearing (not that FIL is likely to admit to it), it might be a reason as to why he needs the tv up so loud. It might be a reasonable level to him, and only him. Perhaps investing in some headphones that pair to the TV, that he can control the volume on (but keep the household silent late in the evening) could be a good compromise?\nSomething to consider...", "One thing\u2026 we had a tree fall on our house and were out of the property for six months.

Your FIL in particular is acting like a childish, selfish,asshole! I can\u2019t believe he has the audacity to expect you to house him while he has a complete disregard for your families health and sanity. Your wife is ridiculous for not backing you up. I\u2019d record the noise they make for several nights and show it to your wife. If he doesn\u2019t like your rules he could always stay somewhere else. You have to put your children and their welfare ahead of your in-laws and wife. Your FIL is aware that headphones and earbuds exist, right?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That means being a considerate person. \nIt seems as though your in-laws never learned basic manners. \n\nYour kids basic needs trump your FIL's wanting to eatch TV at a loud volume in the middle of the night. Constantly disrupted sleep is bad for everyone, but for younger kids it's even worse. The kids shouldn't have to wear ear plugs. Your in-laws vould get headphones instead.\n\nSo, good for you for drawing a line. They seem to not understand it any other way.

I worked nights at one time got home in the middle of the night for my family and it sucks. Now I\u2019m a early riser before everyone else so here I sit with coffee and all of you. They can get tablets and headphones or ear buds like the rest of us. You could look into some for tv too. It\u2019s not their home which sucks for them too but that\u2019s just how it is when you work nights.", "NTA. Your in-laws are rude and inconsiderate, and your wife should be managing them and backing you up in this. Had she done so, you would not need to take such drastic measures. Both you and the kids need your sleep. The in-laws are guests in your home. This is wildly inappropriate for them to act this way. If they don\u2019t like the house rules, they can go to a motel.", "As a parent it's your job, your duty, your responsibility, to ensure that your kids stay healthy and get the education they deserve.\n\nSleep deprivation is a torture method, bad for physical and mental health, and will wreck their education.\n\nBuy your ILs two pairs of headphones and be done with it.

Completely disabling the TV between 8:30 and 6 is too much, YTA.", "NTA but excellent play my friend.", "NTA. Your in-laws sound very entitled and have a lot of nerve demanding things in you and your wife\u2019s home. You\u2019re already doing them a big favor letting them stay with you.\nI hope you and your wife can get on the same page with this, she really needs to be the one to take ownership of this issue since it is her family.", "NTA it sounds like you are being quite reasonable and you are doing them a huge favor by letting them stay with you.  Did he even attempt to get wireless headphones rather than trying to get his grandchildren to sleep with earplugs in their own house?", "NTA. \n\nWho the hell stays as a guest in someone's home, knowing they have young children, and expects them to be okay with them playing loud music all night?\n\nEven without the kids in the equation that's still unreasonable and wildly inappropriate but it just adds another layer of assholery.", "NTA- and my husband says \"give that man a cookie! That's a grand Master level move there!\" ( his MIL lived with us for 2 months so he also says \"I feel that man's pain...the time never flies\") Idk what it is with some parents thinking they can do whatever they want to their kids families. ..it just confuses me. Do they have their own room? Maybe suggest they get a TV for their room to watch in instead.", "NTA you are a Saint. The link to ear plugs would have had me sending links to hotel rooms back.", "NTA\n\nStart sending them links for headphones. If they want to listen to music they can play it through that.", "NTA but your wife sure does suck.", "Or just be exactly that loud when she\u2019s sleeping, which should be fine as she does night shifts. \n\nI\u2019m serious book a couple days off work - then just be loud and annoying like her parents. \n\nAnd then chide her about how she needs to sleep through some everyday noise.", "Exactly. I wonder if their insurance thinks it\u2019s paying for accommodations and FIL/MIL are pocketing the money?", "They don't have any hearing issues that I'm aware of.\n\nOur TV can connect to Bluetooth headphones. I hadn't thought to suggest it for an alternative before, but I doubt they'll go for it. My FIL is always going off about how he thinks airpods and headphones look stupid.", "FIL seems the type who would just blast it from the built in speakers. Sometimes nuclear options are the only options.", "It wouldn\u2019t help with the noise, it would be just as loud in the bedroom", "It wouldn\u2019t surprise me.    \nPeople do it all the time.    \nI\u2019d call the insurance company asking for a quote and ask if their insurance comes with emergency accommodation.", "Good news for him is nobody else but you and his wife are going to see him. You're not telling him to wear them out in public. Asking them to turn it down or wear headphones is more than fair.\nBtw they're probably reaching the age where being slightly hard of hearing wouldn't be noticable outside of this. It starts with the TV for a lot of people, but they won't admit it or might not even be aware how loud they need it to hear it without straining. They still need to be quieter though, waking up your kids is not okay."]}
