I always accepted Sean\u2019s sexuality and I\u2019ll always do. His father and I have always wanted him to be happy. When I first met William I thought that their age difference was too much. It\u2019s still to much, I\u2019m only 6 years older than him. I\u2019m not a prude, but I wasn\u2019t born yesterday. It\u2019s well known that some older people tend to date younger people to take advantage of them. That\u2019s why his father and I were skeptical about this relationship. \n\nSean was recently hospitalized and was in coma due to diabetes. I don\u2019t want to get into that but it\u2019s been very rough for the family. He\u2019s fine now, still at the hospital but will be discharged soon. I can admit that William has been helpful during this situation. He spent the first days Sean was in coma talking to doctors and demanding better treatment. We were lucky of William knowing someone who knows head of department so Sean is getting an excellent treatment there. As far as I know William has a very demanding job, even when he was away for work and we were day and night in the hospital he sent us food and anything Sean or us needed.\n\nWilliam told me that he knows we\u2019ve had our differences but that he\u2019s willing to forgive them because he loves my son. I told him that I have all my reasons to disapprove this relationship and that I still don\u2019t approve them being together. I found this very passive aggressive and I consider that he\u2019s doing all of this just to get our approval. William told me that it\u2019s enough of me thinking that he\u2019s a pervert. Keep in mind, I never called him that word.\n\n It\u2019s not that I have something against William, I just honestly still think that it\u2019s too much. He\u2019s almost 20 years older than Sean. He\u2019s been good to him, but they\u2019ve only been dating over a year. My husband who was skeptical at first agrees with William and he\u2019s getting along with him now. It\u2019s very frustrating because no one sees the things I see. I think I might be in the wrong, but I\u2019m just worried.", "created_utc": 1691687867, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15niewj/aita_for_telling_my_son_in_law_that_i_still_dont/", "score": 1836, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

William did a lot for your son when he was unwell including helping to get him the best care he could.\n\n\n2. He balanced a demanding job while sending things you/he needed \n\n\n3. He reached out an olive branch after knowing how openly disapproving you were of him.\n\n\nThe one reason you give to disapprove is that he's older and \"*some older people* tend to date people to take advantage of them.\" \n\nMy question is: Take advantage how? There is no evidence in your post that points to him taking advantage. If you mean simply having a younger man, well, your son is 23 and a full grown adult. If William is making your son happy, then he's accomplishing what you wanted for him. \n\nYTA.\n\nEdit: Lots of projecting in the replies that goes beyond what was presented in OP's post, but also some reasonable takes. In fairness to OP, you have every right to say you're still not wholly comfortable with the situation and I think that William should be understanding of that. Perhaps it is a matter of whether you openly dislike *him* or strictly the age gap situation.", "I\u2019ve read so many posts where the genders were reversed and not one of them were deemed the asshole \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA based on what's in this post. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>It\u2019s very frustrating because no one sees the things I see.\n\nWhat things? The only thing in your post is that sometimes big age differences lead to exploitation. There is not a single thing here that suggests William is taking advantage of Sean, but you still think he's doing all this nice stuff just for your approval?", "YTA.\n\nAge gap relationships can be a red flag, sure, and I was ready to be on your side until you got the bit where William is supporting Sean rather than doing what gross predators do when they land a younger significant other: force the young one to become their support and fit into their life without making any effort to meet the younger partner where they're at.\n\nThis guy is trying to get to know you and supported your son through a traumatic medical event. Instead of looking out for you son, however, you made it *all about you*.\n\nHere's what I mean:\n\n>I found this very passive aggressive and I consider that he\u2019s doing all of this just to get our approval. \n\nSeriously? You think someone would help out someone in a coma just to be a predator? It's not that deep, man. If William was a hot daddy type he could have another young man on his arm in a second and would take the opportunity of Sean being in a coma to do it. He isn't doing that because he cares about your son. And he's making an effort to cooperate with you even though you're being *incredibly* hostile.\n\nPlus, doth protest too much when you say you accept your son's sexuality. If you're admitting to being as rude to William as you were in this post, when you're tying to put yourself in the best light, it's very likely you said or did something unfathomably rude and homophobic in the past.\n\nGay people have it rough. We don't get a wide dating pool. My family was upset I got engaged to a girl from a cult with a bad relationship with her parents that wasn't the same religion as me. But we don't get to be picky. There aren't plenty of fish in the sea, especially if your son is so sick that medical events like this aren't rare.\n\nNo one \"sees the things you see\" because they're not there. You're making them up to excuse your appalling behavior. And really, acting out and making it all about you and William's supposedly diabolical plot to get on your good side for some reason (totally unnecessary, since he's already dating your son, lady, and your son is an adult) *at the bedside of your son while he's in a coma* is just unfathomably tacky.\n\nYour husband is right, everyone else is right, and you need to do some soul searching before you get uninvited to the rest of your son's life.", "YTA.  If you think William is playing the long-con here and taking care of your son during a time of extreme medical emergency, then I fear nothing may convince you.  Is it abnormal to have an age difference? Sure.  Has it worked countless times in the past? Yes.  Love can be unorthodox, and from your summary it seems this man is extremely caring and supportive of your son, something a lot of people wish they can find.", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with supporting your Son\u2019s relationship but being vigilant. Let your Son know he\u2019s your number one and that he can come to you for anything, anytime. \nThen if it turns out William is shady or hurting your Son, your son has an ally in you. \nOtherwise, you might lose him.", "Let me get this straight.  William goes out of his way to get your son the best medical care possible in a time of need, and you pay him back with your charade?!  Absolutely disgusting.  As soon as they get married, don\u2019t expect to hear from your son again.\n\nYTA by a mile.", "While many relationships with a large age gap have an unhealthy power dynamic where the older partner is taking advantage of the younger one, that is not *always* the case. It doesn't sound like your son is in an unhealthy or unsafe relationship, and William has proved that to you. While your son was vulnerable and potentially dying, William helped take care of you, your husband, and your son. It's time for you to stop being judgemental and work on opening your heart and mind up to your son's relationship. If you don't, it could cost you your relationship with your son. YTA I hope it's not too late for you to fix this.", "YTA. Just because you didn't specifically use the word \"pervert\" doesn't mean that he can't tell that's what you think.", "NTA if it was your daughter and a. guy 20 years older people would be losing their $hit. I can clearly see you are concerned about your son being taken advantage of by an older person and as a mom I understand. However, you may want to put a  lid on those feelings. Your son is an adult and you are risking your relationship with him. Also ,  like him or not the bf did help your kid so a thanks is in order.", "NTA. William was very helpful in your time of need, you can recognize that and be thankful for that. But you are right, it doesn't immediately absolve all of your concerns, 20 years is a HUGE age gap and as a mother, you are absolutely within your right to be concerned for your son. There is a huge imbalance of power between a 23 year old and an established, financially well off and well connected 40+ year old man. You are not wrong and he doesn't get to tell you how to feel about it. Hopefully, all is well and good and you will be proven wrong. But they have not been together long enough to know. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlease don't let this drive a wedge between your son and you. You can be cordial with William for the wellbeing of your son. If you are too outspoken, you will push him further into William's arms and you won't know if things get bad. I know it's hard, especially as a mother, to see your son in such a vulnerable position.", "YTA, but this sub hates age gap relationships, so it will be interesting to see how this goes.  Ironically, if your son was a woman, you'd be vindicated.  But the fact that it's two men - the mob might find you guilty.\n\nSo, why are you TA?\n\n> It\u2019s well known that some older people tend to date younger people to take advantage of them.\n\nSome.\n\nHere is a key thing to.\n\nSome human beings kill other human beings.  That doesn't mean all do.\n\nBased on what you've described, it seems like William has proven himself quite a bit.  You seem very much in the wrong.", "YTA. I do understand how you could be skeptical about the age difference.  A lot happens in 20 years, and it is a big experience gap.  That being said, once William showed his true colors by caring for your son during his illness, this should have been a sign that maybe you were judging a book by their release date, not by the contents inside.  Your son has chosen this man to share his life with, and as an adult you can only support him in this decision and hope that it all works out for the best.  Otherwise you may end up isolating your son for as long as he is with William - which could be a very very long time.", "NTA. If it was your 23 year old daughter dating a 41 year old man the entire sub wpuld be on your side.", "YTA. The only reason you don\u2019t like him is because of his age. Now don\u2019t get me wrong, I think that big age differences like that are gross and I would be concerned if one of my kids was dating someone that much older. But when your kid is an adult you just have to let them make their own decisions and try to be okay with it. If the guy treats your son like shit then you have every right to not like him and express your opinion, but if he is genuinely good to your son then you need to make an effort to make the relationship work. Honestly, most relationships with those kinds of age differences don\u2019t last unless they are actually in love and want to make it work. If they aren\u2019t meant to be then the relationship will go away on its own. For your own sake, you do not want your disapproval to ever be an issue for their relationship, your son might resent you for it if it does.", "YTA. If you really want your son to be happy, something tells me that a man that goes above and beyond to save his life, make sure his needs are met and his family is fed while at the hospital *is* ground for happiness. Get over yourself and your baseless pre-packaged judgement.", "  A lot of people are being hippocritical of your stance on the age difference.  If this was a 23 yr old woman with a 41 yr old man, they would be voicing their concerns. So would I. \n\n You're entitled to be concerned, but. ....they've been together for a year. He makes your son happy. He made sure his partner got the best medical care and got you anything you or his partner needed, all while working a demanding job.\n\nYTA for implying he only did these things to score brownie points with you.", "YTA. I\u2019m a parent as well and understand we worry, but your son is an adult and gets to have autonomy in his relationships. The very idea of two consenting adults being \u201cperverted\u201d together is not only morally backwards, it\u2019s none of your business what they do in the bedroom. \n\nMoreover, you\u2019ve made his boyfriend\u2019s love and care about you instead of your son, and convinced yourself he is going out of his way to show loving kindness because he wants YOUR approval. My guess is he doesn\u2019t care about you or your husband much at all but is willing to show care because he loves your son and knows your son\u2019s life will be easier if y\u2019all get along. \n\nDo yourself and your son a favor and apologize to them both and start actually supporting your sons relationship and sexuality with your actions.", "I feel like you have to think of what you want to get out of this situation... which I presume is a good relationship with your son.  And then see if you are doing what it takes to get there.  Persistently and openly telling his boyfriend that you don't like him is not going anyplace good for your relationship with your son.\n\nYou voiced your concerns... your son has heard your concerns.  That's all you can do.  Anything else is just nagging an adult about the age gap with him and his boyfriend.  And how much time would you want to spend with someone who persistently criticizes your partner or your choices?\n\nYou have concerns (they may well be valid), but you've said your piece and now you need to let go.  Your son is an adult, he is going to make his own choices even if some of them don't work out.  I'm sure your mom felt the same about some of your choices.  Moms, worry, I get it, I worry about my adult kids too... but they're adults and at some point you have to let them live their lives and be cordial to the people who they chose to have in their lives.  You don't want to put your son in a position to choose you or a partner because he might not choose you.  You don't have to love the guy, but being polite and civil is in your own best interest if you want a close relationship with your son.", "YTA here. This doesn\u2019t come off as taking advantage of someone who is younger but genuinely caring for them. Your son is an adult and capable of choosing his own partner. And a year together is nothing to sneeze at.\n\nIf he used the word pervert, it\u2019s because you\u2019re making him feel like one. Time to lay off and accept him. Apologize.\n\nHope your son is doing better.", "YTA.\n\nIf I were your son, I would at least go very low contact with you. You were wrong to begin with, continue to be wrong about this relationship and are just not very smart or kind. \n\nStop putting your energy into being shitty to people.", "Lemme help you:\n\nWhat you want for  your son:\n\n a younger man, wit less connections so your son got worse care and his recovery was not as great. Someone who probably wouldn't be as kind and thoughtful to make sure you and your husband got things that were needed while in hospital. You rather a younger man who wasn't emotionally able to stay with your ill son, who probably would have cheated on him, left him while he was in coma. \n\nWhat you got:\n\nA man who used his connections for better care for your son, things YOU could not get yourself. He took care of your and your husband. He stayed loyal to your son throughout an experience that makes some partners leave or cheat. \n\nThis man HAS PROVEN his worth.\n\nThis man IS NOT after your son's youthful body -- he would have high-tailed it out of there when he was in a coma and therefore \"useless\" if that is what he was chasing him for.\n\nYour objections now? They're stupid, quite frankly, and not based on fact. YOU have gained more from him being who he is. Your son is happy. \n\nIt's okay to admit you were  an idiot and wrong. It's not a badge of honour to cling to a stupid idea when the reality has shown you this man is a GOOD PARTNER to your son. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nI understand being concerned about the age gap. But it seems he has shown several times that he treats your son well. At the end of the day, your son is an adult and you don't get a vote in who he dates. If you continue to be this rude to his boyfriend, your son will leave you and you'll have no one to blame but yourself.", "Sorry but YTA.\n\nHe has proved to you that he loves your son for him. Yes, there is an age difference but you're just following the stereotypical assumption that all guys over 40 are groomers, which isn't fair for either of them. \n\nWhat other reason do you have to believe that, other than his age? You should be happy that your son found a good man that cares about him and treats him right rather than some 21-year-old that doesn't know who they are and is partying and doing drugs...", "YTA the asshole. You need to get over yourself before your son gets sick of it and cuts you out of his life. This man has done nothing for you to dislike him other than being older. Its your hang up to fix because its not what you would have picked for your son but you dont get to decide who he loves.", "YTA\n\nHe's taken care of your son, and clearly they are in a loving relationship.\n\nYou are coming across entirely judgemental and controlling. They are both consenting adults.", "YTA.  All you have listed is good stuff that William has done for your son DESPITE how short their relationship has been.  You have not listed anything bad he has done other than the age difference.  Age difference is definitely a red flag that should be considered, but if the context shows otherwise, you should change your opinion (like your husband has apparently already done).  You seem unwilling to look out for your son's best interests because of your prejudgment that based on your words seems unfounded.  Prejudices may help in certain situations, but when the facts show otherwise, you cant continue to rely on the prejudices.", "YTA. Other than the age difference which only you seem to have a problem with, you gave zero reasons why the relationship is a problem other than \"it's very frustrating bc no one sees the things I see\"...what exactly do \"you see?\" William has been nothing but supportive and caring of the 3 of you. You can be worried - as a parent you NEVER stop worrying about your kids' happiness...but ultimately it's THEIR happiness. We're both in our late 40s and yes, we have knowledge that a 23 yr old might not that this may not be his last or lasting relationship. It may not be forever - regardless, that's not your choice to make for him. Just support him in HIS happiness right now, not what makes YOU happy to see him do or be with.", "YTA. You have one singular reason for disapproving and it\u2019s proven to be incorrect and contrary to all available evidence. You\u2019re out on this island by yourself, doubling down.", "YTA. If was fine to be wary at first, but it seems like you are determined to judge and disrespect William regardless of his actions and how he treats your son.", "NTA\n\nWilliam for sure likes them young.\n\nAlso, I have add I dislike the guy for somehow expecting a medal for entirely normal, basic human decency. Seems manipulative and conceited to me.", "YTA he\u2019s been nothing but good to your son and you\u2019re stuck on the age gap. Could it be a problem? Sure. Maybe the relationship won\u2019t last. But he clearly loves your son and is putting him first. We should all be so lucky.", "YTA. At first you had every right to be weary of this relationship, but you have to accept that, now, he\u2019s taken great care of your son and even you at times. You don\u2019t have to like the age difference, but you don\u2019t want to lose your son over this. You need to show some growth now that you see the relationship is working.", "YTA. You don\u2019t have \u201call\u201d your reasons for disapproving. You have one, which has not proven to be true as there is zero sign your son is being taken advantage of in any way. Quite the opposite. William may be 6 years younger than you but he\u2019s definitely more mature than you are.", "YTA because you're still willing to accept William's help despite thinking he's a predator. Take care of the bills yourself if you don't trust William.", "NTA, that's a huge age gap. The fact that he now feels entitled to say saying let's put it past us and he fogives you, would suggest he did in fact do all that he did for brownie points. Mothers intuition is a really thing in my opinion. I would trust your gut 100%", "NTA, 41 and 23 is skeevy and its hard to just not feel that its skeevy.", "YTA hugely. I'm a female and dated a man 20 years older than me because he was more mature, had a career, knew who he was, etc.. I can understand being hesitant in the beginning but I believe people can't hide who they truly are for long and it comes across that his intentions are true.\n\nAlso just because he used a word you didn't - the word he used pretty much describes what you think of him.", "YTA, William has shown enormous dedication and effort during a challenging time. Remember, your son chose him as well. Please don't make their lives difficult.", "YTA. The age gap can be concerning, but it sounds as if you and your son are close, you all live within a reasonable distance of each other, and you see and have seen them together. They are only a year into the relationship, and if you haven't seen anything troubling other than the age gap, I don't think you should have said anything at this point. \n\nYou can keep an eye on the relationship, remain close with your son, and see how it goes. Some age gap relationships work. Do you know how long William has been out? If he's had 20 years to form relationships that's a different kettle of fish than something more recent. Just monitor and stay close to your son while appreciating William's help.\n\nIf you are supportive of your son, you don't want to alienate him at this time so that he won't talk to you and you won't have a clue if things are going sideways in the relationship.", "NTA, dont let these psychos sway you, a 20+ year age gap is predatory, he might have feelings for your son and he might be treating him well now, but its absolutely predatory, and he is a pervert for dating someone half his age. you dont need to approve of a relationship that is guaranteed to be toxic if not now then later", "YTA. You're allowed to think whatever you want about them (maybe keeping it for yourself? Better) but the moment you accept help from someone and immediately later you criticize this someone, you're a mooch", "YTA- From what you have said about William in your post, he sounds like he loves your son and wants the best for him. He sounds like he treats your son well. What more could you ask for in a partner for your son? I have a 24 year old son and I get it, as parents we want what\u2019s best for them but sometimes you have to let them live their life and make their own decisions on who they want to be in a relationship with. He may be making a mistake or not but this is who your son chose to be in a relationship with and he\u2019s an adult and can decide what he wants in HIS life. All you can do is give William a real chance without being biased because of his age. You and your husband need to support your son or you just may lose him.", "What matters is not the age gap but the quality of their relationship. It sounds as though they have a good one.\n\nYTA.", "YTA... youve convinced YOURSELF that the relationship is predatory. I dated a guy 9 years older than me when i was in college. Yes he was my kab instructor lol. I was 21 he was 29. He called you on the pervert thung because even though you never said it... you never tried to hide it. Grow up.", "YTA: You don't get to pick who your children love.  It is NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.\n\nWhat good will it do anyone if you're right.  People have to live their own lives and chose their own partners and it isn't your place to interfere.  All you're going to do is make Sean chose William or you and don't be surprised if you come out on the losing end of that decision.", "NTA but also you don\u2019t want to lose Sean in the process so if William is a decent guy you probably should just try to accept him.", "Ok, so if this was a 40 yo man dating a 20 yo woman, this sub would be up in arms about the age gap.

I can understand being skeptical of the age difference but they\u2019ve been together for over a year and as far as what you\u2019ve written in the post, he\u2019s never given you a reason to believe that he\u2019s mistreating or taking advantage of your son.", "YTA.  A LOT of gay male relationships have age differences.  Yes it's a huge difference.  But he's taking care of your son and making him happy.  He's done nothing to reflect that he's taking advantage of your son, yet you still (after a year) just can't accept him.  I get being very skeptical at first, but at this point you're more likely to be losing your son than losing William.  You can keep your reservations, but voicing them at this point is going to do you more harm than good.", "YTA. If William's only crime is being older than you'd like him to be but he's otherwise great to your son then the problem is 100% you and your hangup about his age. I'd recommend getting over that before your son feels forced to choose between you. Which again, would be on you.", "YTA he has proven to love your son. Don\u2019t get me wrong it would weird me out too but so far there\u2019s no red flags or a power imbalance in play from what you described.", "YTA.\n\nAnd to be clear, I 100% would vote the same if these are two women, or an older woman and younger man, or an older man and younger woman.\n\nSomething tells me most Aita commenters wouldn't agree, though...", "YTA \u2014 the age difference shouldn\u2019t matter as he cares for your son. Frankly, younger people are often the ones taking advantage of the older partner due to stability; emotional and financial. \n\nAre you telling me your son doesn\u2019t benefit from William making more money? Vacations, nice shows and restaurants, nice gifts, maybe living somewhere rent free? I bet your son is taking advantage of him too. It might be mutual.\n\nYes, William is right. If it was a daughter, you wouldn\u2019t have said this to him. You really should be ashamed on yourself.", "YTA because I understand the age gap issue and I think you should be wary until you understand their relationship dynamic, but not hostile. It's the hostility that makes you the ass.", "YTA.\nYour son is 23 not 13.\nYou're being overbearing and you contradict yourself when you say you want your son to be happy but downgrade his relationship with his spouse and are practically saying you want them to break up.\n\nAge is all but a number.", "YTA.\n\nHe's good to your son and seems to genuinely love and care about him. It's not his fault that he was born too early or your son too late.\n\nAlso? Since he's not married to your son, he is ***NOT*** your son-in-law", "YTA. \n\nI understand having a preconception that a big age gap is a red flag, but this man has proved repeatedly that he actually cares for your son and made it clear this relationship is important to him. He has done everything to be a supportive and engaged partner. \n\nIf this was a brand new relationship, I could understand feeling some concern, but it isn't and the partner has been there for him through hard times already here. \n\nPlus even if you are concerned, your son is an adult and it's not your business to get involved in his relationship.", "YTA  \nYeah im sure he did all of that just to get your approval and not because he loves your son and is a good person.

I always accepted Sean\u2019s sexuality and I\u2019ll always do. His father and I have always wanted him to be happy. When I first met William I thought that their age difference was too much. It\u2019s still to much, I\u2019m only 6 years older than him. I\u2019m not a prude, but I wasn\u2019t born yesterday. It\u2019s well known that some older people tend to date younger people to take advantage of them. That\u2019s why his father and I were skeptical about this relationship. \n\nSean was recently hospitalized and was in coma due to diabetes. I don\u2019t want to get into that but it\u2019s been very rough for the family. He\u2019s fine now, still at the hospital but will be discharged soon. I can admit that William has been helpful during this situation. He spent the first days Sean was in coma talking to doctors and demanding better treatment. We were lucky of William knowing someone who knows head of department so Sean is getting an excellent treatment there. As far as I know William has a very demanding job, even when he was away for work and we were day and night in the hospital he sent us food and anything Sean or us needed.\n\nWilliam told me that he knows we\u2019ve had our differences but that he\u2019s willing to forgive them because he loves my son. I told him that I have all my reasons to disapprove this relationship and that I still don\u2019t approve them being together. I found this very passive aggressive and I consider that he\u2019s doing all of this just to get our approval. William told me that it\u2019s enough of me thinking that he\u2019s a pervert. Keep in mind, I never called him that word.\n\n It\u2019s not that I have something against William, I just honestly still think that it\u2019s too much. He\u2019s almost 20 years older than Sean. He\u2019s been good to him, but they\u2019ve only been dating over a year. My husband who was skeptical at first agrees with William and he\u2019s getting along with him now. It\u2019s very frustrating because no one sees the things I see. I think I might be in the wrong, but I\u2019m just worried.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
