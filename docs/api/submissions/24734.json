I had a very traumatic pregnancy. I ended up having to be bedridden for a long period of time because of my blood pressure being skyrocketed and also I had hyper emesis, so I was throwing up the whole pregnancy. I am very tiny. I\u2019ve always been very tiny. I am 5 foot two and currently at 110 pounds before my pregnancy I wait at least 130. So I lost tons of weight and muscle mass. And every single time I either eat with my husband or his mom we eat out together as a family they start to make fun of my way they start to call me names, and then my mother-in-law tries to put more on my plate, which is gonna be thrown away because I\u2019m not gonna finish it. It\u2019s just too much for me. And then when she does serve me a little bit, she put it on the kids plate and says cause I eat like a little kid. That shit hurt my feelings. And then my husband every single time we get like pizza or something where it\u2019s serve like that he expects me to eat like five slices even when I was normal and a good weight I would only eat two. Then he would criticize me like you need to eat more you\u2019re too skinny. That\u2019s literally what he tells me. \n\nSo it came to the point that one day we were eating dinner with them and she was making fun of my weight and I finally told her look you have a muffin top it\u2019s hanging out of your pants at least tuck it into your pants!! And in my husband was cracking up, thinking that shit was funny until I turned and looked at him. I told him your ass crack is literally hanging out of those fucking pants. It won\u2019t even go over your muffin top to. So don\u2019t talk shit bitch you look like your mom!!! And when I tell you my father-in-law and my brother-in-law, were just in shock and trying to hold back the laughter I\u2019m telling you they were tearing up to the point where they were trying to hold it back because it was so damn funny to hear them get criticized because they criticize my brother-in-law who I will say is very overweight and does need to lose weight but doesn\u2019t need to hear it. You know what I mean they criticize him! So for them, it was a bit of a joy, because they bully all of us. But I actually felt guilty afterwards and I thought like I\u2019m such an asshole for doing that. So the question is, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1692137510, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15s6t7y/aita_for_telling_my_husband_and_my_motherinlaw_to/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are grown ass adults that need to start acting like it.\n\nThings I\u2019ve said to asshats who shit on me for being fat:\n\n\u201cWow. English must have been your worst subject in school, but I\u2019ll help you since you seem to be struggling. FAT IS NOT A SYNONYM FOR UGLY. You wanna know what is a synonym for ugly? Vile, which is a perfect descriptor for how you talk to people.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcuse you, I am in shape. Round is a shape! What do you want me to be, a triangle like you?\u201d\n\nIf they try to tell me I won\u2019t get a boyfriend (assuming I\u2019m straight. The pan erasure\u2026 \ud83d\ude12): \u201cRight, because you\u2019re the greatest catch? Good luck to whoever gets stuck with your dumb ass.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh yes, you, the pinnacle of beau- Never mind, that\u2019s not you.\u201d\n\nSomeone actually had the audacity when I came out to them that she doesn\u2019t dare fat people (wasn\u2019t asking her out, she asked and I told her), so I said sorry, I don\u2019t date people that charge too high of rent for the empty space between their ears. We don\u2019t talk anymore. I was sad about it. \ud83d\ude22\ud83d\ude0f\n\nAs you can tell, I\u2019m a petty b sometimes lol\n\nAll petty sarcasm aside, take care of yourself in the way that\u2019s best for you OP, and fee free to dish it out as good as they serve you.\n\nComplete side note, are you still struggling with emesis? I\u2019m sure if you are, you\u2019ve already talked to your doctor and they probably have you on something, but I find when I get to a point where I can hardly keep stuff down ginger tea really does help. Same with plain white rice and candied ginger if you can keep it down (it\u2019s pretty strong, ngl). None of my business of course, but I hope your recovery is going well! \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA but what's wrong with 5' 2\" and 110 lbs?  My best weight which I would love to be again was 114 lbs at 5' 3.5\" and I was in good shape (so decent amount of muscle, which weighs more) but not thin by any means.  You're at BMI 20.1 which is fine.  At 130 you'd be at 23.8, also fine.  25 is overweight and you usually gain weight as you get older so I see no reason to actively try to gain now."]}
