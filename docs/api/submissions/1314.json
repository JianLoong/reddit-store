Shops grind coffee at the moment of purchase which means the opposite of what you think.", "You said, I only use fresh coffee beans, what your friend hears, what kind of moron are you? Don\u2019t you know what kind of coffee I drink? Keep your worthless gift, idiot.YTA", "YTA\n\nNot for refusing, but for being an AH about it! You could've just said thankyou, explain you're not a fan of it but explain that you appreciate their effort they put into it, or just anything but being an AH about it!", "YTA.  your friend bought you a gift.  that deserves a gracious \"thank you.\"", "YTA, wow.  That was beyond rude.  Even if you don't like the gift, you say thank you. I wouldn't hold my breath on future presents.", "YTA, you ungrateful git.", "YTA, good etiquette would be to thank them for the gift.", "WoW. YTA so much. Also very ungrateful and very entitled.", "YTA\n\n\"Thank you so much! You know how much I love coffee!\"\n\nYou could have, you know, *tried* it. Perhaps it's better than you think. Or if you didn't want it to go to waste, you could have just donated it to the local food bank.", "YTA, what is with people who think honesty is the best policy. It would cause a lot less heartache to just take the coffee politely and throw it away down the road.", "YTA. You know you could\u2019ve just accepted it, said thank you and:\n\n1. Actually tried it\n\n2. Thrown it out \n\n3. Regift it to a friend that is not as big a coffee snob. \n\nI would\u2019ve gladly taken it. I also have accepted gifts I know I won\u2019t use and store it for a regift or toss it. Being polite costs nothing", "YTA. The correct response would have been \"Thank you for the thoughtful gift.\" Then do what you want with it later. But instead, you sounded like a pretentious AH. They called you out on this so you already know YTA.", "YTA. Weren't you taught as a child how to graciously accept gifts that you didn't like?", "When you\u2019re all alone on holidays and your birthday and no one gets you a gift, remember this post.", "YTA\n\nWhen you receive a gift. The proper response is \u201cthank you, I really appreciate you\u201d\n\nAfter that, you can do what you want with your property.\n\nInstead, you had to behave like a pompous A H snob. Not only were you very rude. You made yourself look like a fool.", "YTA, if you don\u2019t like a gift just smile and nod. At least they thought of you and something you like. Not everyone knows about coffee", "YTA\n\nThis is a good instance in which to thank them for the effort and thought.", "YTA \n\nThe only gift you should refuse is currency. Anything else is them taking the time to consider something you might like. Even if you don't drink it, take it.", "YTA, and an ungrateful,  pretentious one at that. A simple \"thanks for thinking of me\" would have been an gracious,  appropriate response to someone who bought you a thoughtful gift on his vacation. You could have at least tried it.", "YTA- it was a gift. It\u2019s the thought that counts. You should have just graciously accepted it and thrown it away/given it away when they aren\u2019t around.", "YTA\n\nThat\u2019s just impolite.", "YTA, you could have either accepted and given it away later or gotten rid of it. Your reaction is somewhat rude and unappreciative. Gifts are more about the thoughtfulness. \n\nAlso, you could have tried it.", "YTA. Your friend did a thoughtful thing. The kind thing would have been to accept it and dispose of or repurpose it later. Look, I'm a snob when it comes to coffee and lots of other foodstuffs. When someone gives me something that I know I won't like I just suck it up and say thanks. Btw, I've been given less than stellar coffee in the past and I just made cold brew because you can't tell the difference in bean quality with cold brew and it's the best way to use up stale beans without wasting them.", "Your friend went on a holiday to relax and enjoy themselves,  then went to the effort of thinking of you,  spending money on you,  and seeing you when they got back and you couldn't even manage a thanks I'll give it a try? The gift here is actually a friend who cares enough to do all that for you, although they probably won't do it again now. \n\nYou need some etiquette lessons or you won't have any friends left to bring you gifts.  \n\nYTA", "Why do people do this. You could solve the issue by simply taking it and throwing it out. When asked you already, how you liked it. You already know you don\u2019t like that kind, so say..\u201dit wasn\u2019t something I\u2019m use to but thanks for thinking of me.\u201d Everything don\u2019t have to be a fight. I understand you didn\u2019t like it but, what did you want them to do with this? Take it back and exchange it?", "YTA. You were being rude. If you don\u2019t want a gift, you say thank you anyway & do something about it after the giver has left. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a worldwide standard to have a roast by date. It wouldn\u2019t have hurt you to try it. Someone brought me some mink poop coffee from Southeast Asia, which sounds disgusting but was actually quite good.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
