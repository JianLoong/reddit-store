He has two kids from his first marriage, a 19 year old girl and a 17 year old boy. The 19 year old is away at college and the 17 year old is a senior in high school. About 10 years ago their bio mom moved to another state with her husband and the kids only see her for about a month every summer. She is well off and pays child support and sees that as her contribution to the kids.\n\nMy husband and I have 3 kids together. A 7 year old son, 5 year old daughter, and newborn son. The end of my pregnancy was difficult and I was on bed rest. My 17 year old was looking for ways to make money but can't really get a job. He plays sports and it is hard to coordinate job hours with practices and games. We also want him focused on college apps and enjoying senior year. Anyway, since he was looking for a way to make money I told him he could help with the kids (the 7 and 5 year olds) on weekend mornings when he doesn't have games. He agreed. Yesterday he was making the kids breakfast when his bio mom face timed him. He told her he was busy with the little kids and his bio mom was pissed. She called my husband yelling at him even though he was at work. He told her that our son wants to do this but she said that he is trapped with no other choice. He told her we pay him but she said it didn't matter and that she is going to bring this to court.\n\nMy 17 year old still wants to babysit since he said it is an easy way to make extra money but now we are wondering how it is going to look since his biological mom doesn't want him doing it. She told him that she will send him all the money he needs so we stop treating him like a slave.

He's doing it to make money. If you want to be extra, extra, sure just tell him that he can always say no if he doesn't want to do it. But it sounds like he already knows that.
