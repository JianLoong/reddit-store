He has two kids from his first marriage, a 19 year old girl and a 17 year old boy. The 19 year old is away at college and the 17 year old is a senior in high school. About 10 years ago their bio mom moved to another state with her husband and the kids only see her for about a month every summer. She is well off and pays child support and sees that as her contribution to the kids.\n\nMy husband and I have 3 kids together. A 7 year old son, 5 year old daughter, and newborn son. The end of my pregnancy was difficult and I was on bed rest. My 17 year old was looking for ways to make money but can't really get a job. He plays sports and it is hard to coordinate job hours with practices and games. We also want him focused on college apps and enjoying senior year. Anyway, since he was looking for a way to make money I told him he could help with the kids (the 7 and 5 year olds) on weekend mornings when he doesn't have games. He agreed. Yesterday he was making the kids breakfast when his bio mom face timed him. He told her he was busy with the little kids and his bio mom was pissed. She called my husband yelling at him even though he was at work. He told her that our son wants to do this but she said that he is trapped with no other choice. He told her we pay him but she said it didn't matter and that she is going to bring this to court.\n\nMy 17 year old still wants to babysit since he said it is an easy way to make extra money but now we are wondering how it is going to look since his biological mom doesn't want him doing it. She told him that she will send him all the money he needs so we stop treating him like a slave. I am the child of Korean immigrants and maybe that is why I feel differently but I am coming here to see if I am the asshole.", "created_utc": 1696859941, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/173si4o/aita_for_using_my_stepson_as_a_babysitter_for_my/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you were pressuring him or making him give up on some activity he was doing I would feel differently. But it sounds like he\u2019s not doing anything else and he wants to make some extra money. That\u2019s fine. It sounds like he could stop any time he wanted so I don\u2019t see this as him being trapped or forced. His bio mom has not a leg to stand on.", "NTA.\n\nHe's getting paid and learning how to contribute to a household. He's also learning how to *earn* money. The athletes I went to school with, regardless of their talent, were all convinced they'd make it in pro sports and never bothered with learning how to *make* money or learn any of the lessons that come with having a job in their teens. Seems like you have a good kid on your hands.\n\nUnless bio-mom's goal is to raise him with a silver spoon, I see absolutely no problems with this arrangement, especially if the son is all for it.", "One of the few situations where you\u2019re NTA even though your step son is babysitting your bio kids and that\u2019s for one single reason; because unlike other posts you\u2019re not *making* him babysit, you\u2019re pay him to help when he\u2019s free. That\u2019s a very big difference.", "NTA\n\nYour kid wants additional money, you offered him an easy way to make that extra money and he agreed. If he is free to say no occasionally or quit altogether, you are not an ahole.\n\nHe's 17 and can make decisions like this.\n\nIf his mother wants to be involved, she cold spend more than just a month a year with him.\n\nI doubt the courts are going to do anything about this. What if the boy was paid to mow your lawn and do other extra housekeeping duties, would his mother have an issue with that too?", "NTA.  I actually thought this might go another way, but this is not you forcing your step-son to watch your children, this is a job for him, and you aren't taking advantage.", "NTA.  You offered him a paying job, and he accepted.  Win/win.  Biomom can pound sand.", "NTA, if he is ok with it, the court will be, bio mom has the issue and in this case she has no  input. if it troubles her so badly, let her give him money to spend.", "NTA, you asked, offered payment, he agreed. Her money or not, he was looking for a job himself, so this is his chance to learn responsibility.", "NTA. It\u2019s truly not her place. Your husband has custody and the kid wants to do it. Tell her to PFO.", "NTA. You're teaching him about responsibility and financially rewarding him at the same time. I wish I'd had a WFH opportunity when I was 17!", "NTA. This is not an example of parentification, but rather solving two needs (yours for help, his for $) in one fell swoop.", "NTA you both came to an agreement and it works for him as well.", "NTA\n\nAt 17 I was babysitting other peoples kids for money. Its not anything detrimental to your 17 year old step son and since he wanted to do it to make extra money, then its not an issue.\n\nHis Mother isnt the sole custodian of the 17 year old, and therefore unless it says something specific in the parenting plan/custody agreement about that then her threatening to take you to court over it is ridiculous.\n\nIf you were sending the 17 year old out to babysit other peoples kids, mayyyybeeee she could have a (small) leg to stand on, but not when its babysitting his step siblings in his own home.", "NTA\n\n Ignore the mother, she has chosen not to be a parent to her kids for the last 10 years, it\u2019s too late to want to take an interest now.\nIf he wants to keep helping out with his siblings then let him.", "NTA first of all, he AGREED to it, and second, you are paying him. How is any of that wrong? I think she needs to mind her own business.", "NTA The court will not care about her craziness. Let her try. The judge will laugh. You gave him an opportunity to make the money he wants doing a job that he wants to do. That is good parenting. Her giving him money for doing nothing is bad parenting. Keep up the good work.", "NTA- your step son wants to earn extra money, and this is one of the easiest ways for him to do so. You are not forcing him to watch the kids, in addition to paying him to do so. It is no different from him having a job elsewhere, him watching his younger half siblings is just more convenient for him with regards to time and location. From the sounds of it, this is a mutually beneficial arrangement, that either one of you could back out of at any time. My personal opinion is that bio-mom is being a PITA because she can be.", "Let your son handle it if he can. He is 17 and needs to stand up for what he wants. Tell him also to be mindful of what he shares with his mother\n Sometimes, white lies and lies by omission are not always bad", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Its clear he wants to earn money and be independent. She can take it to court if she wants, but nothing will happen.", "You are NTA. This is something he wants to do. You are not forcing him and he is earning money. Have your husband say to his ex \u201cwhat if he dis babysitting for other families. How is that different from this\u201d", "NTA. He is old enough to decide.  She needs to back off.  Just make sure he truly wants to do it and is not being guilted into it.  Kudos for paying him.", "Absolutely NTA. He is 17, he is old enough to decide what he wants to do. And you guys are paying him, so he is in no way being treated like a slave. The bio mom here is definitely out of line. \n\nI have no clue how a court would take it, but I would hope they'd hear the kid out about this since his opinion is the one that matters the most in this situation.", "NTA. I used to do this for free lol kids that age on a weekend just want to watch cartoons, eat food and play video games anyways", "NTA - You are not forcing him to babysit for free, you are paying him and it's his choice.  Let her take you guys to court, they won't do anything as your husband has full custody and what goes on in your house is none of her damn business as long as it isn't illegal or life threatening.  Tell her that her job now is to just pay up and shut up as that is what she wanted to do.", "Aside from financial aspects you are giving step\nSon responsibility and he is learning things that will help in the future as an adult. He\u2019s a great kid and family sounds wonderful.", "NTA. This is a paying job and he can\u2019t stop doing it at any time, no one is taking advantage of him", "NTA", "NTA, he wanted a way to make some money and you're paying him for his labor and prioritizing his extracurriculars and studies as well.", "Heh. I love when I brace myself for a story based on the title and end up reading something totally reasonable and wholesome instead. NTA.", "NTA. I\u2019m not usually an advocate of encouraging a kid to lie to their parents but in this case, meh. The 17 yo should take his mother up on the offer of money AND continue the paid babysitting gigs.", "NTA. Just make sure he knows that he has a choice. That's all you have to do. He's doing it to make money. If you want to be extra, extra, sure just tell him that he can always say no if he doesn't want to do it. But it sounds like he already knows that. I think you're doing a good thing. You're giving him a chance to earn money while teaching him some responsibility. Also, in my opinion,  the best birth control is getting teens to watch young kids.", "As long as you are paying him fair and comparable hourly child care rates, he still has time and energy for school, sports and friends and he wants to do it- then it should be okay.", "NTA. If you're in the United States, your stepson may be permitted to testify on his own behalf IF she tries to take this to Court. Speak to your attorney.", "Nta but sit your son down and have the convo again just you and him and be very very observant. It does make me apprehensive like is the mom freaking out because he\u2019s said something before or is she just being paranoid. Better to double check tho", "NTA Bio mom is going to get laughed out of court", "NTA and tell stepkid \"Sorry, but your mom has complained about the babysitting gig so it's off the table for now. But on the plus side she said she'll send all the money you need. ALL the money you need - that's what she promised.\" and wait for that to sink into a 17 year old brain that's probably just a little p155ed at mom right now...", "NTA\n\nAs long as you are paying him a fair wage and he is choosing to do so of his own free will, there is nothing wrong with it.", "Nah. He's willing to do it, and he's getting paid. It's not like you're making him do it.    \nNTA.", "Nta", "NTA - kid gets to do something in the comfort of his own home and make money doing it while spending time with his siblings which he obviously cares about", "NTA. You asked him and you are paying him, that alone says it all.", "NTA. If your stepson is happy to do it, and happy to earn at the same time, all is good. You\u2019re not forcing him.", "NTA. You aren't using him as a babysitter (would be an asshole move) you are employing him as a babysitter. Big difference.", "NTA... this is a real job that he has agreed to.", "NTA\n\nThis is just drama. Ignore her. Worst case scenario it comes up in court and your step son goes \"I want money\" and that's the gist of it.", "Same! I was all ready to be like \u201cyou chose to have children\u201d and whatnot. But they\u2019re paying him and he wants to do it!\n\nI\u2019d laugh at bio mom. He\u2019s 17. He\u2019ll be 18 before she even gets a court date! \ud83d\ude06\n\nEdit: Oh yeah! NTA!", "LOL, I know.  Was already to post \"the answer is ALWAYS YES\".  Except when it's not!", "Yes!  Instead it is absolutely heartwarming. They carved out a time that works for his schedule when he can do a job that relieves some stress for them and lets him earn money.  A perfect low stakes everybody wins solution!  Plus, given the low stakes I bet the kids experience it as a positive time with their sibling rather than him just being paid to do it.", "And he\u2019s learning good life skills. Too many parents send their kids to college not even knowing how to make the most basic of foods or do laundry.", "That and the fact that the kid wants to.", "Millions of 17 year old kids have babysit kids for money, there's nothing weird or exploitive about it."]}
