Usually when it comes to Santa it\u2019s the other way around.\n\nAs someone else has pointed out they likely have come across people already who don\u2019t believe in Santa. Belief at their age is a combination of trusting in magic and *wanting* it to be real.\n\nUsually when children have other children tell them Santa isn\u2019t real their parents will ask them how they feel. \u201cWell, fourth grader and seven year old, all the presents are signed with Santa and the cookies and milk we leave are gone in the morning. What do you believe?\u201d\n\nIf a five year old telling them Santa isn\u2019t real is enough to stop them from believing then they are ready to stop. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if this is less about preserving the magic for them and more about you not being ready for the magic to end.\n\nSpeaking of magic, children raised without Santa can still have wonder and magic in their lives. The idea that parents who don\u2019t do Santa are denying their children happy childhoods is judgmental and problematic on multiple levels.\n\nIt\u2019s clear you disagree with your daughter\u2019s choice about Santa.

Of course, I asked my mum and dad in a panic. Their response was that not everyone believes in Santa, but so long as I did, Santa and the magic would be real. As an adult, I look back and am touched by their way of dealing with things, because even without a jolly old man in the skies, it\u2019s true; as long as you believe, the magic is real.

Finally, one year when I was about 12, as we were pulling out of the driveway, my dad started an obviously fake fight with my mom because she forgot something.

Your house, your rules. NTA", "So my kids never believed in a living, breathing Santa because we didn't think it was necessary for them to enjoy the holiday. We did give them a \"spirit of Santa\" talk about how Santa is sort of embodied in the generosity of people. We also explained that some people believe in Santa as a real person and that's okay too. My biggest thing was making sure our kids don't yuck other kids' yum. This is especially important to me as we are a nonreligious family.  \n\n\nAs such, I think it's perfectly reasonable for non-Santa kids who still celebrate Christmas to be given a bit of guidance on how to behave towards other kids. However, at 9 and 7, I am absolutely floored at the idea that someone hasn't already blown up the Santa thing for them. My kids saw schoolyard arguments over the existence of Santa in kindergarten. Even I recall that back in the 80s when I was a kid. Point being, I think the more prudent discussion is you with your kids. You can't just make every Santa nonbeliever in the world avoid the conversation with your kids. You can temper your kids' expectations and give them some level of protection against it like \"some kids don't believe in Santa\". Big thing being that we live in a world full of people of different beliefs and they're going to organically come across kids who don't believe as a matter of religion or culture. It's just unreasonable to expect too much bending over backwards on that.   \n\n\nSorry but YTA. You didn't exactly spell out how you asked, but at best, you weren't clear on what you want her to do about it. At worst, you are asking her to have her child lie.", "Yes, YTA. \n\nSanta, Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy.... They're all lies. Kids are gutted when they learn the truth. It's no longer magic to them, they've been fooled\n\nAt 7 & 9 I'd be amazed if they actually really believe anymore, they go to school, right? It's surely been spoiled for them already.\n\nI knew before I was 6 thanks to the school bus. I told my parents a week out from that Christmas. Saved them a lot of effort. Never told my daughter about Santa, the reality was the same as Bart Simpson's - \"There's only one fat guy that brings presents and his name ain't Santa!\"", "If a 7 and 9 year old want to believe in Santa, there is no way that a 5 year old is going to talk them out of it.\n\nKids all like presents so if the discussion starts, just say: hey, who is next to pick one from under the tree!?", "YTA  \nIn summary you want her **5yr** old to keep a secret from **older** kids and are prepared to ruin your relationship with your daughter about that - wow! \n\nThe reality is you like the whole Santa experience and are causing the problem. The older they are when they find out then the bigger the problem is, could even start causing trust issues if the 9yr old gets to 11-12 when they find out. Especially if they figure/find out that's the reason your eldest stopped coming for Christmas.", "Do the Santa stuff before daughter and grandson come over.

I doubt your kids live in a high tower and aren\u2019t permitted to speak to anyone. They have definitely heard random kids at school or daycare speak about Santa not being real. Your kids aren\u2019t stupid. Just talk to them and see how they feel about Santa, and then you can decide to stop the charade or talk about how some people don\u2019t believe.\n\nHell, most kids Christmas movies are entirely about the concept of whether Santa exists. You shouldn\u2019t be punishing your daughter to hold onto such a strange lie your kids see through like that.", "YTA\n\nKicking your daughter out over Santa is stupid. Your younger children *will* find out. At 9, the older one is probably already playing along for the sake of the youngest.\n\nI found out by walking in on my parents building my new dollhouse on Christmas Eve when I was 6. My whole family, to this day, will still label little gifts as \"from Santa\".\n\nJust because Santa isn't real, doesn't mean the magic and joy aren't very real and important. Lying to two of your children and alienating the third is not the way to have a good holiday season. \n\nI also still put out cookies. My roommates eat them.", "Yes. Clearly YTA here.

Your grandson will not be the first person to tell them Santa isn't real. They've heard it before. They started hearing it as soon as they started school, or made friends on their soccer team, or ...simply spoke to another kid during the month of December. \"Is Santa actually real?\" is a very common conversation topic for kids, starting at about 5. \n\nMaybe your kids really do still believe. Maybe they're going to say they still believe until they're sure it won't affect how many presents they get on Christmas morning. A *lot* of kids do the latter, especially when Mom is clearly so attached to the lie. \n\nExcluding your daughter and grandson from your family Christmas because they *might* tell your kids something that they have definitely, absolutely, undoubtedly already heard....?

In which case you are double the asshole for banning them from coming when they were planning on making the effort to travel with a 5 year old. \n\nOr it means they live close but have never been invited to your house for Christmas. Because for at least a couple of years her son would\u2019ve been able to speak - even if in his toddler pidgin. So you would\u2019ve had that problem last year and the year before. \n\nHonestly, I\u2019d go low to no contact with you if I were your daughter. \n\nAs it is I\u2019ll be paying attention to this sub for your inevitable post about your daughter not letting you see your grandson.", "What are you gonna do when your 9 year old finds out the truth?

Tell them about kids of different faith, and what they celebrate and believe in.\n\nMake this in to a beautiful teaching moment for your kids instead of cutting a part of your family off to perpetuate a lie that your kids will find out about in like, two or three years anyway.", "YTA.\n\nYou want to exclude your daughter and her child for the sake of lying to your kids.", "YTA.

We still talk about him, my son still gets excited to see him on Christmas decor in shops and stuff, he\u2019s just not under the impression that he\u2019s a real person.

It depends a lot on the kids.", "Let them dream a little longer. Tell them to make a top big thing, then a top little things, then let them loose on everything else they think they'd like so \"Santa\" can see what he can get hold of. It's ok to dream as long as the people don't buy them everything. Kids know they won't get everything they want. For me, it was all about the dream of having whatever I was adding to the list. I knew I wasn't going to get 99% of it. Mum wouldn't buy me my top item if it was a boys toy anyway, no matter how badly I wanted it. Not until I was 10 anyway.", "Heh, you reminded me of when middle kid was five and their Xmas wish list was five pages long, single spaced. I should have kept it.", "It could've been worse. My sister told me that \"santa\" wasn't real when i was 6. Then she told me that actually, \"santa\" was a really skinny machete-wielding serial killer who liked to try sneaking into people's houses so he could kill them in gruesome ways. She said I should run and hide if i ever saw any hint of him. She had to fess up to my mom when I kept having nightmares.", "No problem. Also, if it helps at all, you can use the UK term for \"Christmas lights\", which is \"fairy lights\". It's become my preferred nomenclature since I heard of it as I enjoy the lights, but not the whole Christmas thing.", "That was incredibly dumb by her mom. FIFTEEN!!!", "\ud83d\ude02 Love it. When I finally told my mom the jig was up cause of the handwriting thing, she was like, \u201cUhh, Santa doesn\u2019t have time to do the tags, so parents do them.\u201d Pretty clever.", "Santa only gets my kids one gift a year anyways. I take credit for my hard work.", "Our rule is \"if you believe, you shall receive.\" My kiddos are 24, 21, & 18.  In our house Christ was the Spirit of Christmas and Santa was the magic, but our kids knew from the very beginning that not everyone believes or celebrate the same as us. We have lots of friends of different religions and we all observe differently", "Dang. Jewish Santa knows what\u2019s up.", "My kids 3, 6, 8 years my oldest two know Santa isn't real but they still like to bake cookies and stuff for Santa and we still put one present under the tree from Santa. I knew very young that Santa wasn't real but my mom put a small gift under the tree from Santa until I was in my late teens and I left home to live on my own.", "I love the idea of all of your adult siblings visiting Santa as a group and taking a picture.", "YTA", "YTA\n\nI could get into a whole discourse on how old your younger children are, ask how old your grandson is, wonder why you don't choose to use the word grandson or tell us his age, point out that your children already live in a world where not every child around them believes in Santa. .....\n\nBut to me it's much simpler than that. Your own rigid ideas about how Santa is paramount and your rigid ideas about only one way to have a happy Christmas with your younger children are more important to you than your oldest child and your grandson, together. Your own rigidity is more important to you than two members of your family, a child and a grandchild.\n\nI suppose it's not necessarily AH to not love your family, or to be rigid, or to be a narcissist, or whatever is the reason why your rigidity is more important than your daughter and grandson. Some people are just made that way, and don't try to change. I still think you are an AH though because you have ample proof that your priorities are hurting your family, from your daughter and from your husband, and still you choose not to change.", "You don't need to ask anyone to lie.  Your 9 year old already knows Santa isn't real, they just don't want to get full confirmation of it from an adult, because in their mind, if they ask and you tell the truth, the Santa fantasy ends and the Santa presents stop, or you will lie and now they have confirmation their parents lie even when asked directly.  \n\nYour 7 year old already suspects because \"Santa is/is not real\" discussions are already happening on the school playground by age 7 (nothing to do with any kid's religion).  \n\nYour grandson announcing Santa is fake won't make any difference to your younger kids.  They will either defend Santa as real in front of you, because they like the idea of Santa, or because they think the other kid is an idiot for saying it out loud, and giving up his future Santa presents, or because they do believe and think he is wrong, They do this often at school as Christmas approaches. \n\nThe kids themselves are knowingly and willingly continuing the Santa fantasy by age 9 just to keep the fun going.\n\nDon't create a rift in your family because of something your kids have already been told multiple times by their school friends and you are under the delusion that no one has ever told your kids Santa isn't real before now.\n\nYTA", "YTA", "The santa lie is cute when they are 5.\n\nAt 9 they should know the truth.\nThey will get bullied so hard walking around believing santa is real.", "You are excluding members of your FAMILY at a family holiday and causing what could easily turn into a permanent rift... over something that is trivial in the grand scheme of things and bound to end eventually. Yes, YTA.", "Sorry but YTA. You are forcing your grandchild to lie, when clearly your daughter wants to raise the child with more ethical values. Furthermore you are not only choosing two children over the eldest but you are also choosing them over your grandchild! I'm baffled by your favoritism. Lastly, at 9 and 7 you're doing your kids a disservice to maintain this charade (which they probably have discovered anyway already) and you are setting a dangerous precedent where the kids will stop trusting you", "YTA, have fun making the holiday a headache and nuisance for everybody else becuz that's what you're doing. Christmas is about family more than it'll ever be about a Magic Reverse Burglar (santa). You've shown you're oldest that you care more about the bullshit side of Christmas than you do the real stuff, like being with family.", "I don\u2019t think sending your daughter and her son away to \u201ckeep the magic alive\u201d would be showing your kids the true meaning of Christmas", "You know what my mom said when I asked if Santa was real? \"It's fun to believe.\" The fact that you're letting a fictional man get in the way of your family just to protect a lie they're inevitably going to learn the truth of anyway is disgusting and absurd. First, apologize to your daughter. Second, *talk to your younger kids.* Tell them that not everybody believes in Santa but it's fun to believe. Because they're going to learn that Santa isn't real eventually, and then they're going to learn that you excluded their sister and nephew from a family holiday over it. What do you think that's going to do to their trust in you? YTA, get your head out of your ass, your lie is not more important than your family.", "YTA. You're choosing an imaginary Coke advertisement over your daughter and grandson. Very, very strange.", "YTA for me right now due to the way that you described your eldest daughter...btw she clearly knows she was a mistake by the way you describe her and how she came into the world. Real nice Christmas magic ya got there, mom.", "I think you\u2019re making a bigger deal of the Santa thing than you need to. If your children go to public school or consume any media they know not everyone thinks Santa is real or even celebrates Christmas. \n\nYour adult daughter is an adult, you need to treat her as one and as a competent parent and not as a bigger child.", "Are your kiddos homeschooled and isolated from the rest of society? Because otherwise, I guarantee you there\u2019s kids telling them that Santa doesn\u2019t exist same as it probably happened to you eldest daughter. We can\u2019t protect our kids from everything, and even if we could\u2026 doesn\u2019t mean we should. However, I do find it to be a simple request that your daughter could try to fulfill\u2026 but maybe there\u2019s more there than this superficial conflict. Talk to her and try to find out what\u2019s up.", "Not just any child, her 5-year-old GRANDCHILD. jfc, \u201csorry, honey, grandma won\u2019t let us come to Christmas because we aren\u2019t liars like her and grandpa, and she doesn\u2019t want your aunt and uncle to find out that she\u2019s been lying to them for their whole lives and would rather us spend Christmas alone than risk them finding out that Christmas isn\u2019t really about a fat old stranger sneaking into your house in the middle of the night.\u201d", "Right? It also strikes me as very strange OP says \u201cmy daughter\u2019s son\u201d and not \u201cmy grandson\u201d - I get the feeling she doesn\u2019t really want her eldest to be a part of her re-do family but also doesn\u2019t want to be the bad guy.", "This is exactly how I explained Santa to my kids.  I grew up knowing Santa wasn't real, but I wanted my kids to have the magic of Xmas.  My boys look forward to the elves coming and the decorations going up.", "Yeah, at 7&9 they 100% know Santa isn't real (unless they have some developmental disorder).", "Idk there is a big difference between everyone they meet not participating in the tradition and someone at their small holiday celebration not participating in the tradition.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t expect every kid my children know to play along with the Santa story. I would be pretty upset though if on Christmas morning one of their cousins said \u201cthat\u2019s from your mom; Santa isn\u2019t real\u201d while my kid was excitedly unwrapping presents. \n\nIt\u2019s not outside the realm of normalcy to ask an older kid to keep the fun going for the younger ones when they stop believing. The whole world isn\u2019t going to participate in your holiday traditions but expecting family members to not ruin something fun on a holiday for the young kids is reasonable IMO", "Same! I\u2019m not religious but I like the decorations and the tree and the Christmas music and giving presents. I feel like a holiday can be anything you bloody well choose it to be.", "I think it\u2019s an excuse not to have her adult daughter and grandson over.", ">Parents use Santa to scare their kids into submission and once they don\u2019t need that anymore they tell them the truth; it\u2019s fucked.\n\nIt's just to break em in for Jesus, I think", "At least Santa leaves behind presents as proof, god just creates famine, disease and floods to start the list off. You're better off worshipping Santa and letting the god story be the fake one.", "Some places don\u2019t have middle schools. Like the entirety of Australia."]}
