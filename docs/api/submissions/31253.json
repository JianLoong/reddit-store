Usually when it comes to Santa it\u2019s the other way around.\n\nAs someone else has pointed out they likely have come across people already who don\u2019t believe in Santa. Belief at their age is a combination of trusting in magic and *wanting* it to be real.\n\nUsually when children have other children tell them Santa isn\u2019t real their parents will ask them how they feel. \u201cWell, fourth grader and seven year old, all the presents are signed with Santa and the cookies and milk we leave are gone in the morning. What do you believe?\u201d\n\nIf a five year old telling them Santa isn\u2019t real is enough to stop them from believing then they are ready to stop. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if this is less about preserving the magic for them and more about you not being ready for the magic to end.\n\nSpeaking of magic, children raised without Santa can still have wonder and magic in their lives. The idea that parents who don\u2019t do Santa are denying their children happy childhoods is judgmental and problematic on multiple levels.\n\nIt\u2019s clear you disagree with your daughter\u2019s choice about Santa.

Of course, I asked my mum and dad in a panic. Their response was that not everyone believes in Santa, but so long as I did, Santa and the magic would be real. As an adult, I look back and am touched by their way of dealing with things, because even without a jolly old man in the skies, it\u2019s true; as long as you believe, the magic is real.

NTA\n\nChristmas magic is fucking awesome! I love the ability to believe that children have. Santa Claus, fairies, the Easter Bunny, etc.. it's all good fun.

Perhaps no one will miss her.", "(I\u2019m not responding to the judgment, only one part of the reasoning) You think little kids aren\u2019t excited about putting out cookies or thinking they can hear reindeers on the roof or following that Santa Tracker thing?

However, Saturnalia and Festivus ARE celebrated in the winter and was stolen from the pagans by the Romans and renamed to make the forced conversion to Christianity more palatable to the people they stole Saturnalia and Festivus from.", "I had a girl in high school scream at me because my sister told her sister there was no Santa. I told her it isn't our fault that xtians lie to their children.", "It kind of upset me that she referred to the child as her daughter's son and not her grandson.

Asking was not the problem, the problem was losing sight about what the magic of Christmas is supposedly about, family. Daughter won\u2019t tell son to lie fine, have Santa come before daughter and son get there. Not banish them. But I mean look at the age gaps, the daughter might already feel some kind of way/treatment from being the kid of a teen mom and her siblings are from a different stage of life. All I\u2019m saying is Santa isn\u2019t worth tanking familial relationships. And as another kid who\u2019s family never celebrated Christmas, what did y\u2019all do on Christmas Day? We would always go out for Chinese food. We still do! Thanks for sharing your perspective!", "Agree! I actually remember the moment that I realized Santa wasn\u2019t real. I was about 8 and my sister decided that we should take a peek in our mom\u2019s room to see if she had gotten any for us yet. We didn\u2019t find any presents only everything thing for stockings stuffers. We were pretty poor so in our family Santa brought the stockings not actual gifts. We then understood that Santa was actually our mom and we stopped the whole Santa thing for a while. We eventually did play along for my younger siblings for a few years after they were born (I was 13 when the first was born), yet my little brother was way too smart for his age and realized that Santa wasn\u2019t real by the age of 4 and the Santa magic was ruined for him and he also told the other 2 that he wasn\u2019t real. He would also tell everyone who he thought believed in Santa because little kids have absolutely no filter and he was taught that lying is bad so he didn\u2019t want to lie. Which is absolutely true when you think about it, we teach a child as soon as they are able to understand that lies are bad, yet you then turn around and ask them to lie\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.

Especially if/when OP\u2019s kids are openly talking about Santa on Christmas with everybody there listening.. if it was another topic, like knowing that someone was lying to their significant other about something, and they were talking about it in a group setting in a way that perpetuates the lie, I absolutely think the person who knows it\u2019s a lie is obligated to say something to the SO. Not necessarily in the moment in front of everybody though. \n\nIt can be hard to explain to a 5 year old what the difference is between those situations, since at their core, both are allowing people to believe in something that\u2019s not true, after being asked to keep the truth a secret.", "Okay in that case whilst I think it's bad she hasnt atleast offered to talk to them how effective do you think policing a 5 year olds language would actually be?", "Same here!

Of course you always wonder and question, but I\u2019d say I still 80% believed as a 12 year old", "I did too, though I think I was questioning a bit. But, I just played along in school when everyone in my class talked about him not being real. I lied and said I was forced to believe because of my sisters. I don't recall being devastated.

I fully accept that this is likely to be the last year because my oldest will go into high school next year and I have no illusions that the older kids there would tell him. I'm going to speak to him in the summer before he goes and explain that santa is the magic of being there for the children, the magic of giving gifts without the need for reward or thanks, of family and friends. I have a feeling ill have to include my younger son as well as both are autistic and I don't like the thought of oldest trying to keep a secret from youngest.", "Yup I have a cousin who just turned 12 and still believes.

That sounds like a lovely tradition, and I'm glad you got to enjoy it with the belief and with the wisdom.", "That\u2019s not universal.

I don't believe in Easter and you don't believe in Passover and that's life.
