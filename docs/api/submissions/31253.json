Does it really have to be that binary? \n\nI empathize with wanting to give your children the happiest holiday memories and feeling unhappy when wrenches get thrown in those plans but it seems like there should be creative solutions here that don\u2019t make other members of your family feel unwelcome.

Usually when it comes to Santa it\u2019s the other way around.\n\nAs someone else has pointed out they likely have come across people already who don\u2019t believe in Santa. Belief at their age is a combination of trusting in magic and *wanting* it to be real.\n\nUsually when children have other children tell them Santa isn\u2019t real their parents will ask them how they feel. \u201cWell, fourth grader and seven year old, all the presents are signed with Santa and the cookies and milk we leave are gone in the morning. What do you believe?\u201d\n\nIf a five year old telling them Santa isn\u2019t real is enough to stop them from believing then they are ready to stop. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if this is less about preserving the magic for them and more about you not being ready for the magic to end.\n\nSpeaking of magic, children raised without Santa can still have wonder and magic in their lives. The idea that parents who don\u2019t do Santa are denying their children happy childhoods is judgmental and problematic on multiple levels.\n\nIt\u2019s clear you disagree with your daughter\u2019s choice about Santa.

Of course, I asked my mum and dad in a panic. Their response was that not everyone believes in Santa, but so long as I did, Santa and the magic would be real. As an adult, I look back and am touched by their way of dealing with things, because even without a jolly old man in the skies, it\u2019s true; as long as you believe, the magic is real. And honestly, even now, many years later, I still feel the Christmas magic and love the season very much. It\u2019s my favourite time of year. \n\nAnyway, I went on to believe for quite some time, and dismissed what other kids said. Perhaps you can do the same with your children.

Finally, one year when I was about 12, as we were pulling out of the driveway, my dad started an obviously fake fight with my mom because she forgot something.

I would also put items in my own stocking and go through the charade of taking each item out one by one.

And I said what my family had taught us about santa giving whats needed and some kids chuckled, some kids were happy like \"oh that's why I only got a toothbrush and an orange, I'm still a good kid\" and she went to the teacher crying that I was bullying her and calling her poor, the teacher came over and I explained and the other kids backed me up.
