Your parents sound abusive. Telling a 9 year old that if their future husband abuses them, they will have deserved it is insane. I would completely cut contact. \n\nThey also have no right to dictate your relationships.", "NTA. If your father was saying things like that to you while you were a small child, I cannot imagine the other emotional abuse you went through. This is your life, love who you want and do not let anyone dictate your future. If this man is perfect for you, and you all can work out your religious differences, then be with him and enjoy your life!", "NTA.

Don't ruin a good relationship just because your parents don't approve of him.

Let's be honest, these people will never do anything but sabotage your relationship, wedding, marriage, kids, and life.  \n\nYou woild only be the asshole if you let them near your future kids to abuse emotionally the way they abused you.", "Hahahaha, live your own life, OP, and your parents can go pound sand if they don\u2019t like it.

You should have a relationship that you are happy with and if your family likes them too, it\u2019s just that much better. If they don\u2019t then it\u2019s good to look at why and make the decision yourself. \n\nYou can still hold onto your relationship and forgive your dad. Yes it was a super shitty thing for him to say. But everyone makes mistakes. Date and marry for love and that they are a good partner, not because some ass hole thing your dad said 10+ years ago. \n\nIt takes a strong person to apologize. It takes a stronger person to forgive.  So ESH, especially if you would forgive him if he asked. And thinking you have to hold that against him to be able to continue pursuing your relationship.", "YTA You're an adult now, holding onto something from when you were nine? People change. Your dad's not perfect, but neither are you. If you're so \"grown,\" maybe start acting like it and consider forgiving the man.

It's fine to forgive him- but certainly NOT to abide by his wishes.

Fuck them and their fucked up religion! I'd never forgive him for saying that either, and well done you for using it as a life lesson. Finding a man with the qualities that are important to you is a brilliant way of using that moment of shocking truth for your betterment, rather than just heading down the path he planned for you.

That's a horrible thing to say to a child, and it sounds like he's not sorry- he just wants you to pretend it never happened.", "NTA. Sounds like the best thing for you would be to stay LC and maybe even go NC with your family.\n\nWith family like that you'd probably be better off away from them even at your lowest point.\n\nIf you still live with your family move away at asap, gather all your important documents, have all of your mail forwarded to a po box before you move.
