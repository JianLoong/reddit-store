Your parents sound abusive. Telling a 9 year old that if their future husband abuses them, they will have deserved it is insane. I would completely cut contact. \n\nThey also have no right to dictate your relationships.", "NTA. If your father was saying things like that to you while you were a small child, I cannot imagine the other emotional abuse you went through. This is your life, love who you want and do not let anyone dictate your future. If this man is perfect for you, and you all can work out your religious differences, then be with him and enjoy your life!", "NTA.  That\u2019s a very fucked up thing to say to anyone, let alone a child.  Plus it\u2019s not like he\u2019s done anything to warrant a forgiveness.", "Time to go no contact with your father.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWhat he said was fucking wild, and adding to that, the only reason this conflict even came up in the first place was because he doesn't approve of your partner? I thought, judging from what he told you when you were a child, that it didn't matter what sort of person your future partner was. \nNow it does matter? \n\nNo, he can get lost.\n\nYou're fine.", "NTA you are the victim here do what makes you happy and feel safe!", "NTA. \n\nYour boyfriend sounds like the ideal man. Don't ruin a good relationship just because your parents don't approve of him. After all, if all goes well, you will live with him for far longer than what you lived with your parents. \n\nYour parents need to either accept him completely or accept that they can't dictate who you date/marry.\n\nI wish you the best of luck.", "NTA, your father is just another person using \"religion\" to justify being a selfish prick.", "NTA\n\nHow can you forgive someone who said something they actually believe that is utterly despicable? And maybe he still believes it, but wishes he hadn't told you?\n\nYou have found a person who is far better than your father. Ignore your parents and do what is best for YOU.", "NTA. He has shown you who he is; believe him.", "NTA - live your life.", "Skip forgiveness and go right to forgetting these people exist.  Let's be honest, these people will never do anything but sabotage your relationship, wedding, marriage, kids, and life.  \n\nYou woild only be the asshole if you let them near your future kids to abuse emotionally the way they abused you.", "Hahahaha, live your own life, OP, and your parents can go pound sand if they don\u2019t like it. NTA", "NTA. Choose you. Your life, your future. As you say, he has not apologized. Who says that to a child? It sounds like your parents do not approve of you, so why would they ever approve of a partner you pick? \n\nYou don't have to forgive people because they are family.", "What he said was unforgivable. End of story. NTA. He's lucky you even speak to him!", "NTA. Fuck em", "NTA \nYou were right to go Low Contact with your father, I\u2019m glad you via nice partner.", "NTA.  You don't need these people in your life.", "Who says that to a kid???\n\nNTA", "NTA, and stop going home.  They are horrible people, and are not looking out for you.  Get out, get safe, and stay away.", "NTA but time to go NC.

I hope you and your partner have a happy life!", "The thing is sometimes forgiveness is about letting go of our anger. I\u2019m not saying that you aren\u2019t right to pursue a relationship that you want, because you most definitely should. You should have a relationship that you are happy with and if your family likes them too, it\u2019s just that much better. If they don\u2019t then it\u2019s good to look at why and make the decision yourself. \n\nYou can still hold onto your relationship and forgive your dad. Yes it was a super shitty thing for him to say. But everyone makes mistakes. Date and marry for love and that they are a good partner, not because some ass hole thing your dad said 10+ years ago. \n\nIt takes a strong person to apologize. It takes a stronger person to forgive.  So ESH, especially if you would forgive him if he asked. And thinking you have to hold that against him to be able to continue pursuing your relationship.", "YTA You're an adult now, holding onto something from when you were nine? People change. Your dad's not perfect, but neither are you. If you're so \"grown,\" maybe start acting like it and consider forgiving the man. Holding onto this ancient grudge isn't just hurting him; it's making you look bitter and petty.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's fine to forgive him- but certainly NOT to abide by his wishes. He does not get a say in how you live your life, you are an adult. \n\nI would definitely consider forgiving him for past mistakes, as an excercise in *letting go* because carrying around anger from the past, hardly serves you.

The only people who tell you that you must forgive are either abusers or enablers. The only person you should forgive is yourself. Everyone else you choose to forgive is just grace.

He wished an abusive spouse on a NINE yr old--that is totally f\\*cked up.\n\n2) he is making your relationship with a GOOD man about him--what you did to him--you didn't do a d\\*mn thing to him, you are living your life.\n\nTell your Dad how it's going to be--this is the relationship you have, he can accept it or he can reject it/you and NOT be in your life--the CHOICE is entirely his at this point, but if he keeps up his sh\\*t it will be YOU making the CHOICE, and he may not like it.\n\nop=NTA", "NTA but no contact might be a good option.", "You missed the part that apparently OP's family does not like her partner solely because he believes differently. \n\nAnd there's not really a reason to forgive someone who tells their own child they deserve to be abused.", "The fact that the father disapproved of the partner because of religion is a sign that he is exceedingly narrow minded.

The fact that she remembers that a decade later means it made a huge impact on her. And her father is an asshole so why should she forgive him.\nI haven\u2019t forgiven my dad for doing something 35 years ago - he has since passed away and I still can\u2019t and probably never will."]}
