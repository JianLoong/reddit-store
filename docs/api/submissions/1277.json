You owe them nothing and have agreed to nothing. They\u2019re trying to rip you off and they know it. If their lease says 6 tenants, the most generous offer I\u2019d make in your case is 15% (1/7th) of the utilities, and even then\u2026 you\u2019ve signed nothing, agreed to nothing, they have no legal right to collect so they\u2019re relying on your generosity to receive ANYTHING for the last year and a half they didn\u2019t discuss the issue with you.

And since the bill is in their name and you don't have a contract, they probably can't force you to pay anything. I'm sure the number of people living their is a violation  of some sorts and you can use that as bargaining power.

They are defo trying to rip you off. And it's their fault you haven't paid anything so far so I wouldnt be making any back payments either."]}
