I was the baby growing up, youngest grandchild, and the only child of my parents (who were the babies of their families as well). I love my parents, I even named one of my son\u2019s middle name after my dad. But, for a large portion of my childhood I lived with my grandma due to both of my parents working long hours and not being able to afford childcare. \n\nThis led to me being really close to my grandma, closer than my 3 cousins who also spent a lot of time with grandma compared to most people in the world. \n\nAfter college i got pregnant pretty fast with my oldest, and my grandma was so excited. My oldest cousin, who we will call Sally (32F) had already given her 3 great-grandchildren and my grandma loved children so she was excited for more. Grandma offered to babysit for me since I wasn\u2019t working far from her house, and so I spent even more time with my grandma, it was a win-win situation. \n\nAnyways, a little under a year ago my grandma passed unexpectedly after getting Covid. It was a heart wrenching and exhausting battle with many ups and downs and at the end even the doctors were surprised by her sudden passing. She passed 2 weeks after the birth of my second youngest son. (Yes i had all my kids 11-13 months apart) I went through a really rough time after, and i was so thankful for my entire family being there for me and still being excited for my son despite what we were all going through. \n\nNo one was surprised when I got pregnant again within a couple months. At this point My husband and I have good jobs and good money and everyone knows we plan on having 5-6 kids. This time though, my baby is a girl and my family couldn\u2019t be more excited for my baby girl in the family. \n\nAs soon as I found out her gender I knew I wanted to honor my grandma in her name. So, I decided on my grandmas beloved nickname, being her middle name. I shared my decision for her name with only my parents who were both in tears when i told them and so i figured my entire family would have a similar reaction. I waited to announce her name till birth when I shared a picture of my baby girl, wrapped in a swaddle with my grandma\u2019s favorite flower, and a sign read the name. \n\nMy family responded positively in the group chat but I knew something was off when none of my cousins mentioned it when they visited. Finally when my baby got out of the hospital a couple weeks later and we got home I got a call from my oldest cousin. She told me that I should\u2019ve discussed this name with the rest of the family since my other cousin planned on naming her future kid this. I almost laughed, my cousin doesn\u2019t want kids for many more years so why would I plan around her potential future. \n\nMy husband agrees with me, and so does my parents, but no one else in my family does and even some of my friends agree that I should\u2019ve discussed it with my cousins. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1667207732, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi5x6b/aita_for_naming_my_daughter_after_my_late/", "score": 175, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Our Grandma was an incredible woman who played an equally important role in all our lives..  All of us had a deep personal relationship with her and would also spend time together as a group with her. Her passing was a tragedy and I have to be honest that If any of my sisters or cousins named their child after her without mentioning it beforehand, we'd all be (at least secretly) annoyed and it would cause some distance. It's not about 'choosing the name first'.. it would feel oddly intrusive on our relationship to her and awkward to have to call their child her name.  It feels like the level of importance she played in our whole family makes it so there's an unspoken indecency to just choose the name for your own child. I know I would never choose the name, it's too sacred.\n\nIf you are not at all close to your cousins or didn't grow up with them then this doesn't really apply.\n\nHope this helps, just wanted to offer another perspective.. but at the end of the day people can name their child whatever they want:)", "NTA.
