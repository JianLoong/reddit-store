In the future record their conversation and run it through a translater", "INFO: Would you have been upset if they weren\u2019t asking your husband the same questions they had ask you earlier?

They didn\u2019t get all of the info they wanted to from you, so they asked your husband\u2026.and they asked him in a different language to hide it from you. NTA", "NTA. The fact that your husband actually translated the initial question for you gave me real hope for him .... but then it all went wrong. Next time, he needs to tell them directly: \"Aunties, let's speak in \\[language\\], please.\" and if they continue to speak in the language that excludes you, he should translate every word they say for your benefit until they stop. It's one thing to slip into your mother tongue out of habit or by mistake; it's another to do it on purpose to exclude someone who is sitting right in front of you -- in your own home, no less.", "NTA.

Your husband may put up with it, but you don't have to. Politely but firmly explain to your husband that you see it as disrespectful and if he loves you he'll understand that you won't be disrespected in your house and to your face.\n\nEdit: If he forgets next time, explain it in English.

I have no idea about your guys prior relationship but it seems odd that she would just not speak in the language you could all understand, maybe your husband couldn\u2019t speak that language and they felt more comfortable talking to him but idk. I dated a Cuban woman for a while and sometimes her mom and dad would talk to her in Spanish about me in front of me because when you\u2019re with family that primarily uses that language, sometimes it just feels natural to talk in that language. Normally my partner would ask for them to speak English as they could but it wasn\u2019t uncommon for them to speak in Spanish at the dinner table in front of me. Either way your reaction was uncalled for. Nothing really that awful happened, they were just talking in another language about you and you were still included in the conversation. It is rude that she wouldn\u2019t use a language all 3 of you could speak, and your husband should\u2019ve spoke up for you, but you storming off from the dinner table in the context is really childish and inappropriate. You could\u2019ve asked your husband why she wasn\u2019t speaking in the language or asked her to speak in it if she understood you, although she should be doing that on her own you are the one who immaturely stormed off.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
