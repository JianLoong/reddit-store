You are aware of your MIL's allergy.

If ever you choose to have a baby in the future, you now have a shield against her unwanted, unplanned, inconsiderate visits.\n\nNTA", "NTA yet, but you need to talk to your husband about what you two expect concerning family dropping by. Maybe you see her as an occasional visitor but your husband has given her the go-ahead to drop by any time. A lot of young couples struggle with this issue at first, few families have the same expectations of random visiting. It could be that you choose to change things, it could be he talks to his mother and sets new boundaries. The way MIL acted is not right. It's not her house, her little boy is growned up, and he has a new woman in his life. But he needs to talk to her and set boundaries as part of a couple, you two can't be divided in this.", "NTA. She is extremely entitled.  It is YOUR a HOME.

I would be sad since fall is my favorite also and cinnamon is in everything. She\u2019s probably feeling a bit left out of festivities as is so that\u2019s probably where the overreaction is coming from.", "NTA but a great MIL deterrent.

It's one thing to ask people to clean out the house for visits, that's reasonable. Asking that all your family members not even OWN the thing that makes you allergic...that's crazypants behavior. Your MIL is TA.", "Okay I started this believing you were absolutely TA but....\n\nYOU DIDN'T RISK ANYTHING! You didn't let her in your home knowing about the allergy! You make sure to be considerate of her when you know she might be near but let's face facts, Cinnamon is kinda the lynchpin of the season from September to January.

Since that\u2019s the case NTA.\n\nI will say I\u2019m not sure if I would feel comfortable doing this if I had a loved one with such an extreme allergy. How long do you need to air out your home before she\u2019s able to safely visit?\n\nI would likely just use cloves instead of cinnamon instead.

But the worst is sunburn. I've gotten sunburned through tinted car windows and once even through an airplane window. My husband found that one particularly hilarious because I had a line straight down the middle of my face. The right half lightly burned and the left half completely normal.\n\nI tend to wear longer sleeves, full pants or maxi skirts/dresses in summer to protect as much skin as I can. But since I've learned the hard way that clothes shift I still slather sunscreen all over only wearing underwear. Well, unless I'm going to go swimming, then I have to do it naked. Wearing sandals requires slathering my feet in sunscreen. Often I don't want to bother so I wear athletic shoes. \n\nIf I know I'm going to be outside for any length of time I also throw on a wide brimmed hat. If we're going to be somewhere that involves hanging out, I always sit in any shade available. Even then it's sometimes not enough. At least in those instances it's only a mild sunburn. My husband and I went to Gatlinburg in June one year. SPF 30 reapplied throughout the day and I ended up with a tan. Which is the only time I have ever gotten a tan. Oh, and after a day or two the sunscreen makes my entire face sting really bad.\n\nSo yeah, I avoid leaving the house as much as possible during the summer. Going out takes like 20 minutes for the sunscreen and practically being swaddled like a mummy. Which in the 90+ heat is NOT comfortable. Sunscreen makes me feel all sticky and greasy and gross. Even being super careful I've had to have a malignant mole removed.
