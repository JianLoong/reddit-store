You are aware of your MIL's allergy.  You ensured that she was not around when you put the cinnamon of the stove and when she showed up unannounced you stepped outside to meet her and shut the door behind you.  You did everything right.  Expecting you to never have cinnamon in your house again is overkill on MIL's part.", "Serves her right for dropping by unannounced. If ever you choose to have a baby in the future, you now have a shield against her unwanted, unplanned, inconsiderate visits.\n\nNTA", "NTA yet, but you need to talk to your husband about what you two expect concerning family dropping by. Maybe you see her as an occasional visitor but your husband has given her the go-ahead to drop by any time. A lot of young couples struggle with this issue at first, few families have the same expectations of random visiting. It could be that you choose to change things, it could be he talks to his mother and sets new boundaries. The way MIL acted is not right. It's not her house, her little boy is growned up, and he has a new woman in his life. But he needs to talk to her and set boundaries as part of a couple, you two can't be divided in this.", "NTA. She is extremely entitled.  It is YOUR a HOME.  You have every right to make it smell however you want.  \n\nJust a thought that putting a cinnamon broom on the door would be a great deterrent for MIL to know when she\u2019s NOT WELCOME. Acts like garlic for vampires.", "NTA\n\n\"I'm so considerate I assumed you had the decency to not pop-in.\"", "NTA and now she knows to let you know ahead of time before she drops by. \n\nBonus:  Fall = MIL deterrent.\n\nI do feel bad for her being deathly allergic to cinnamon. I would be sad since fall is my favorite also and cinnamon is in everything. She\u2019s probably feeling a bit left out of festivities as is so that\u2019s probably where the overreaction is coming from.", "NTA but a great MIL deterrent.  She can't expect to be accommodated in other people's homes, especially if dropping by unannounced.", "Nta you are accommodating when given adequate notice. Your Mil doesn't live there you shouldn't have to  dictate your life round hers.\n\n\nPs. Obviously if that's your blend for what I call a simmer pot cool but it sounds like your loose spices are the same ones in pumpkin spice.", "NTA. It's one thing to ask people to clean out the house for visits, that's reasonable. Asking that all your family members not even OWN the thing that makes you allergic...that's crazypants behavior. Your MIL is TA.", "Okay I started this believing you were absolutely TA but....\n\nYOU DIDN'T RISK ANYTHING! You didn't let her in your home knowing about the allergy! You make sure to be considerate of her when you know she might be near but let's face facts, Cinnamon is kinda the lynchpin of the season from September to January. (Believe me I hate it in a way only an Autistic can but I also accept its gonna be everywhere and thats just a me problem and I have to live with it.)\n\nNTA", "NTA, you make an effort to put everything away when she comes. Its your house and you can do what you want in it.", "NTA.\n\nMIL is extremely inconsiderate and rude for believing she is entitled to stop at your house unannounced and that you would have it set up to accommodate her.  You take the necessary steps when you know she is coming over.  The least she could do is let you know. \n\nGrow up MIL.  The world doesn't revolve around you.", "Nta. Her allergies and issues should not have a complete impact on your life and home. You're generous enough to make sure you don't use those things when you know she's coming. I'd say it's a blessing in disguise. Now she can't show up uninvited and impose.", "NTA. You shouldn't have to stop something you enjoy on the off chance she's coming over, that's not a fair expectation.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"My MIL had dropped by unannounced. \"  SHE is an AH for coming over uninvited.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"She just rolled her eyes and began to walk away.

NTA.", "NTA.\n\nShe showed up without warning and gets hoity-toity about something?\n\nBut, gee, wouldn't it be great if all MILs would be allergic to cinnamon from birth?\n\nIt would be so easy to wrangle all those reddit posts about domineering MILs. Posters could discuss the potency of various brands. There could even be a chain of cinnamon-product stores, \"for the discriminating daughter-in-law.\" Candles, c sticks for hot toddies, etc. So much more!", ">Before getting to the stairs, she turned back to look at me and said that it is extremely inconsiderate and rude that I would be willing to risk her having an allergic reaction just because I like the smell.\n\nCongratulations on the MIL repellent recipe! NTA.", "NTA. \n\nfor Christmas your should disinfect an empty ground cinnamon container, fill it with sand, and give it to her as gift", "It sounds like you and husband have already made clear to your mother in law that you would prefer she call ahead of time to spend with you. Since that\u2019s the case NTA.\n\nI will say I\u2019m not sure if I would feel comfortable doing this if I had a loved one with such an extreme allergy. How long do you need to air out your home before she\u2019s able to safely visit?\n\nI would likely just use cloves instead of cinnamon instead. Similar scent (and a key component to pumpkin spice) but you would never have to air out the house for your MiL, letting all those autumnal scents linger longer.", "Boil cinnamon everyday.
