After a quick MRI, it turned out that he had hydrocephalus (i.e., inability for the brain to regulate the fluid inside of itself) from a tumor (which he apparently had since he was a toddler) that grew to the point of blocking a major passageway in the brain. Over a two-week period, he had *three* brain surgeries to help treat the hydrocephalus - all of them were successful. The tumor was also found to be an extremely rare one, but in all documented cases found to be benign (also great!)\n\nMy brother was set to propose to his now fianc\u00e9e that weekend, but instead he proposed while he was in the ICU room hooked up to all the machines. It was super emotional for us all and we all were cheering him on.\n\nHowever, while we were there visiting my brother from out of town, my mom decided to invite my aunt along, as she was a nurse and knew some of the terminology being thrown around in the ICU. This is where things really took a turn for the worse (not regarding my brother, but with my family there). My aunt found out through my brother and his now fianc\u00e9e that they planned on eloping before the actual wedding, and my aunt - a devout Christian - said that she couldn't believe my brother for wanting to do that. She said that no one in the family would ever want to go to the wedding if they eloped before the marriage. Keep in mind, this is *after* my brother went through three brain surgeries.\n\nI got so angry at her that I lashed out and said that my brother and his fianc\u00e9e are two consenting adults and that they don't need approval from someone who really hasn't been a part of their lives at all in the past decade. She got angry back and said that it's not the \"Christian way\" to which I replied that they don't need to follow her skewed logic of what it means to be a Christian and that she should read the gospel of Matthew where it clearly says \"do not judge, or you will be judged\" (my brother and I were raised Catholic and hated it). \n\nShe got frustrated and started crying and later my mom confronted me angrily and asked me to apologize to my aunt, which I promptly said no. I said to my mom that I always have my brother's back, and that she should have his as well. My brother and his fianc\u00e9e supported what I said to my aunt as well and are on my side. I realize she is my aunt, but she has not been a part of mine or my brother's life whatsoever. Who is she to start calling the shots as to how my brother lives his life after a traumatic event like that? I realize emotions are high with everyone, but I feel there's definitely things that should *never* be said no matter what.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699246515, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17ov6ns/aita_for_not_apologizing_to_my_aunt/", "score": 20, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your brother is grown, him and his fiancee can do what they want and she can take her \"christian ways\" and shove it.\n\nNTA, for the sake of the grading.", "NTA go you, I\u2019d definitely apologise for the outburst but I\u2019d absolutely hold my ground. Religion is not anyone\u2019s place to force upon no one no matter the circumstances, at the end of the day we all practice differently. Not every one persons life will be lived the same.", "NTA - Who doesn't love a high handed moralist condemning a family member for something he hasn't actually done... after said family member survived three brain surgeries?\n\nYou have to love them, man. And yes, you are absolutely right. As an older brother myself, yea, I've got my brothers back in pretty much any situation and him for me in return.\n\nWhile theologically you can both readily argue (as you did) who had the correct understanding of scripture, it funnily enough isn't even relevant here.\n\nYour brother did not do X. He almost died. I think any moral repudiation for something he did not do... should probably wait for a setting that isn't in the hospital, and it should be coming from his parents IF they decide its even a conversation worth having.\n\nBless your mother, but it sounds like she's trying to be a peace maker. Stick to your guns brother, what your aunt did broke both moral and cultural norms, and she owes your brother a genuine apology.\n\nPs. For a theological argument to throw at her, also include the line about the splinter in your brothers eye vs. The log in ones own and remind her that your brother never did X thing, it never happened, he nearly died, she should be thanking God that her nephew survived a horrifying experience that could have ended his life.\n\nPps. Sorry, one more - Is it the church service, a piece of paper, a legal document, what actually joins two souls together... or is it... you know God himself who can look into and see the hearts of his sons and daughters? \n\nIs she invalidating any harmonious union that occurred prior to the New Testament or between two people who are faithful to each other but can't be married in the eyes of the state (I.e. Race laws and Roman times when men were prohibited from marrying due to a stupid emperor's need for more fighting men). Bury your aunt in theology, history, and good old human decency.", "NTA at all!!!\n\nI once had an aunt confront me at my great-grandmothers funeral about not getting confirmed with the Catholic Church. I\u2019ve never liked this aunt, but she came up to me with \u201cI hear you\u2019re not getting confirmed\u201d \u201cyeah I\u2019m not Catholic, I don\u2019t believe what they believe\u201d \u201cwell MY daughters would get confirmed even if they didn\u2019t believe because they love me\u201d! Let me tell you, I handled it much worse than you did. Threw my full plate of food at her, got up in her face\u2026her cop husband had to separate us, it was bad. \n\nSome people are so up their own ass with their faith they don\u2019t know the right time or place to face these kind of conversations. Just like my great-grandmas funeral, beside your brothers hospital bed was neither. I\u2019m glad you made her cry, she 100% deserved it. Maybe she\u2019ll think twice before assuming the whole world will bend to her opinion\u2026probably not, but maybe.", "NTA, and I don\u2019t think she deserves an apology for the outburst either. Maybe next time she\u2019ll think a bit harder before she speaks.", "NTA. I was brought up in a strict religious family and I have no time for people like her. She should be busy praying for your brother not criticising him. \n\n\nSeriously, I hope he's OK.", "NTA\n\nIt's none of her business. Her faith may dictate her life, but that's the only life she has a say over. People who push their religious ideology are the worst.", "Definitely NTA. That was a good comeback.", "NTA. As a very literal life-long aunt, how my siblings parent their kids and how my adult nephews and nieces run their lives is only my business if explicitly shared with me.", "NTA", "One more proof that there is no hate like christian love.", "NTA\n\nA little bit ago I read a comment where the commenter told the rude person that they made Jesus cry. Perhaps you could steal that line. \"Dear Auntie, I am sorry for upsetting you the other day when you made Jesus cry by being hateful instead of sharing Christian love. I am sure he will forgive you because he loves you even though you don't follow his teachings.\"", "NTA\n\nYour aunt is bringing up stuff that doesn\u2019t matter and isn\u2019t timed right. She\u2019s out of tune.\n\nGlad your brother is on the mend! Speedy recover and warm thoughts sent to your family.\n\nAlso: my husband and I eloped in a very small ceremony. It pissed some people off which I think says more about them than it does us. Marriages are personal.", "NTA. You didn't lash out, you defended your brother. And last time I checked, the Ten Commandments did not include *Thou Shall Not Elope*.\n\nPaul said, *And now these three remain: faith, hope and love.
