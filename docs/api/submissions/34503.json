Yes, you initially agreed to the three of you, now it's growing arms and legs with extra expense and chauffeuring.

What if you aren't enjoying yourself or they want to stay longer. \n\nSuper weird to pay for this rando.... And in this economy! Erg. Run NTA.", "YWNBTA. It's not your idea of a good time, they want you to partially pay for someone you don't really know and to drive and not have a drink. \n\nEasy way out - tell them you've not been feeling well and have tested positive for COVID.", "NTA.  You agreed to join two friends for a dinner.  Now it's morphed into a party for a friend of a friend?  And then they want you to pick them up and drive them?  No.", "NTA\n\n  \nSimmply tell tghem you can not pick them up, and you certainly won't pay for someone you don'T know.", "Your friends suck.   First they change plans, make it about the birthday boy, ask you to pay and ask you to DD.

I've been on the receiving end of friends randomly adding people that I don't know to our plans and, not that it turns out bad, but it doesn't turn out good.

You'll probably have fun.", "Ywnbta but no offense I would hardly call this a chore. Its like 2 things. That u can say no to.", "YTA. Sorry but I find all the reasons for backing out lame.
