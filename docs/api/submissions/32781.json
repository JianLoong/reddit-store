There are tough conversations to be had when one is pregnant without planning it (regardless of age), but it was not your MIL's place to have *any* of those conversations and she didn't even approach it as a conversation: she was trying to manipulate your daughter emotionally.\n\nShe deserved to get kicked out. She has no respect for boundaries or decency. \n\nFood for thought: Could you (or husband) touch base with SIL to see if she knew what MIL was doing? I hope she was unawares, but if she was not, it may necessitate a conversation with both MIL and SIL about boundaries and what is and is not their place in regards to your daughter's pregnancy (although I also encourage you to check with your daughter to see if she is willing, and comfortable, to have you advocate on her behalf this way).", "NTA\n\nKeep defending your daughter.\n\nI will NEVER understand this attitude. Hubby and I spent 20 years trying to have a baby. Even after a miscarriage that nearly killed me. I would **never**, in a million years, try to *convince* someone to give up their child. It's horrendous and she deserves for you to go full no contact until she apologizes.\n\nFWIW, two of my cousins had babies at 16 and 17. They both have master's degrees and happy lives. One is married with 3 more kids, one has never married but isn't lonely or unhappy.* Their children are also successful. Your daughter can do this, and you know how to help. That's the majority of what she needs. I hope her baby is a blessing to you all.\n\nETA *I wrote that jokingly because she's had a couple of amazing SOs. I didn't mean that unmarried people are lonely or unhappy, I was thinking of her specifically, but in print it sounds insulting and I did not mean to do that!", "NTA if your daughter wants to keep her kid she should keep her kid. She's growing them in her body and carrying them those 9 months. She has bodily autonomy. There are other options for SIL she could do a lot of good adopting a child. Additionally, SIL needs a reality check its super fucking weirdo behavior to ask you for your daughter's child. MIL is the asshole for trying to go behind your back to tell your daughter to give her child up. MIL is downright slimey.", "Sounds like you and your husband are together on this. NTA. \n\nMIL crossed the line. She's TA. \n\nSIL maybe is too? I assume she wants to adopt this kid and that why MIL is pushing the agenda? \n\nDaughter may well have it tough just with age, but sounds like (apart from MIL and maybe SIL) she has supportive family. She's in a good situation all things considered. \n\nBe wary of future whiteanting from MIL (and SIL?) though.", "Even if your daughter eventually decides that teenage motherhood is not for her, she is not a broodmare for your inlaws.  Letting a close family member adopt the baby is a horrible idea put forth by horribly selfish people.  Good on you and your husband to have your daughter's back.  NTA", "NTA\n\nWhether you agree with your daughter\u2019s decision or not, it\u2019s good that you have her back. You know first hand how difficult this path can be and you\u2019re doing an excellent job of protecting her where you can.", "NTA. How did MIL get in the house? If your daughter didn't let her in then change the locks or it's going to be a case of lather, rinse, repeat if she knows your schedule. I would also have a talk with your SIL and her spouse that they aren't getting the baby so they need to look for the next option.", "NTA\n\n I love that you just opened the door and said \"get out\" clear & concise!", "NTA, the decision is your daughter's. No one should be allowed to guilt her. I have seen people do this to young mothers, and I find it disgusting. You were a good mother.", "NTA whatever your daughter decides, being told by a trusted adult that she wouldn't be a fit mother, and that she should feel guilty for not giving SIL the child is utterly repugnant and gross. You have spoken to your daughter. You have given her all the information and allowed her to have her choice. I'm sure you have not sugar-coated anything. YOu have done right by your daughter. You're a good mom and your MIL sucks.", "NTA thank god your husband is on your side", "NTA. Your daughter is still your daughter, and you are doing what any parent would. My dad still holds grudges with family members over things they\u2019ve said to me that I\u2019ve forgotten. It\u2019s your job to keep her safe & protect her from everyone. MIL is totally out of line to put that level of pressure and guilt on a 7 month pregnant young woman, despite already being told her wishes.", "NTA. \n\nInform your MIL that babies are not handbags and you can\u2019t just reserve one that you like. \n\nAs an infertile woman, I would never dream of manipulating someone into giving me their baby. WTAF?", "NTA - I'm glad that your husband is on your side.  \n\nShe came to your house, knowing that you and your husband weren't home and filled your daughter with doubts about being a mother.  Your MIL has no business being around your daughter.", "NTA where do people get the idea that a woman's uterus is open for discussion?  Oh right.... I remember now. Supreme Court. It's a pitiful state of affairs. I'm glad she has her mother supporting her decisions. I hope she's just like you and doesn't let anyone interfere in her or her child's life.", "NTA\n\nDO NOT LET HER COME BACK\n\nEven if your daughter opted to do adoption the last person she should choose is her step Aunt!  That is a situation ripe to ruin lives!", "NTA. She has not only harrassed your daughter while she is vulnerable but unabashedly insulted you and your parenting. For the record, you are clearly an amazing parent supporting your daughter during this challenging time and standing up for her so ferociously when attacked. Congratulations on your first grandchild!", "NTA. It's one thing to bring up the possibility of the adoption and that's a HUGE stretch as she should have run it by you first before she even thought of broaching the subject, but to hotbox a teen like this then guilt trip then is, frankly, nauseating.\n\nI wish the best for your daughter. I was adopted and am a big fan of it, but I was born in 1962 so an unwed mother then is a far cry from today. That said, it's still a hard row even with family support. An adoption with this crew would probably be disastrous though.", "NTA. Your daughter doesn't need language like that, telling her she's going to fail. She also doesn't need guilt trips. And you don't need that sort of judgment.", "Your MIL is treating your daughter as an incubator of a free baby for your SIL, which is disgusting on so many levels. I feel like this is a no contact situation, because I feel like your MIL will not know when to quit. She needs to apologize or she (and SIL if she\u2019s in on it) doesn\u2019t get to see the baby until well after the mother-child bond is permanently established (ie in grade school). NTA and good for you and your husband for standing your ground.", "Not even a little bit, but make sure MIL doesn\u2019t try to steal that baby.", "This is speculation on my part. SIL is willing to adopt, but there may be a good reason she hasn\u2019t had a child placed with her.\n\u2026doesn\u2019t want to pay adoption fees?  Then how committed is she?  She or her husband could get a job that has adoption benefits. \n\u2026doesn\u2019t want to wait?  Then, how committed is she?\n\u2026is unable to get a child placed with her?  Why?\n\nYou are right. NTA.", "NTA. She WAY overstepped. I would keep full NC until after the baby is born.", "You and your daughter are definitely NTA. What is wrong with your MIL, though, I have no idea...", "NTA\n\nYour MIL was way out of line with this. It's not her place at all to be talking to your daughter like this.", "NTA. You told her beforehand that your daughter had already made a decision. She decided to overstep. The fact that she initiated the conversation when neither you nor your husband were present is a huge breach of trust, imho. I'd have reacted the same. In fact, I'd probably go LC and closely supervise any contact she may have with her grandchildren going forward.", "Clearly NTA. Id ban her for your daughter's sake. \n\nYour child's well-being is your priority. Not the feelings of your inlaws.", "NTA\n\nYou were just being a protective parent. Your mother-in-law's interference was way out of line, trying to pressure your daughter into something she clearly didn't want. Your daughter needs that support, not someone second-guessing her decisions. Your husband's got your back, which is fantastic. It's all about creating a space where your daughter feels loved and respected, especially during such a crucial time in her life. You did what any caring parent would do.", "NTA, wtf is wrong with her?!", "NTA. Your MIL was being incredibly disrespectful. She has no right to talk about you or your daughter's decisions that way, in your house. Good on you for standing up for yourself and your daughter.", "NTA - MIL is out of control.", "NTA. Watch how quickly you can go NC with MIL over this if she doesn\u2019t stop it right now", "NTA the worst thing is that MIL was manipulating her by telling her she wouldn\u2019t be a good mom. She\u2019s not giving your daughter any confidence or support.", "This is the exact kind of mama bear shit I am here for. No, you reacted perfectly. Just a simple \"get out\" without any cussing? Nice. I would have given an earful myself so good on you for having more resolve. lol glad hub has your side, too. She is WAY out of line. Not all young mothers are bad mothers, and it sounds like the expecting couple is handling this the best they can. NTA", "NTA. Grandma needs a time out. A long time out. A 9 month time out.", "NTA.\n\nYou did the right thing. You MIL can kick rocks. She had no right to do what she did.", "NTA. your Mother in law way overstepped. if sil want to adopt the fine. but she need to either go foster care route or adoption agency or something. but trying to convince and guilt you daughter into giving up her child after she clearly stated she wants her baby is out of pocket", "Wait a second\u2026 this isn\u2019t even her granddaughter by blood, right??? Your daughter to your MIL?? Either way absolutely NTA. What a jerk your MIL I am livid for you.", "NTA. Your daughter is not an incubator for a childless family.\nAnd I say that as someone who struggled with fertility for 10 years before having a 'take home baby'", "Big NTA.  \n\nI don't think having a kid at 17 is a good idea.  But it's her decision to make, right or wrong, as she must live with the consequence.  That will mean spending the next two decades playing mom instead of building a career or traveling, but giving up the kid would also mean potentially spending the next lifetime regretting not being a mom to your kid.  Only she can make that decision for herself, as she must live with the consequences.  \n\nMIL was fine to make the offer.  But the second she says F17 is going to be an unfit mom, is going to repeat the cycle or whatever, that makes her TA here.  She's trying to manipulate a girl into giving up her own child for her own (altruistic, but still selfish) desires.  And that is not okay.  \n\nGlad your husband is on your side.  I hope F17 appreciates her mom and stepdad because you both sound like you're doing it right :)", "NTA. DH is either an AH or being manipulated by MIL and SIL.   Keep your daughter away from them.   Tell your husband and his family to mind their own business. Your daughter and her bf want to keep their baby and that's that.  I just keep getting a gut instinct for your daughter to get restraining orders against them as she nears birth. Possibly alert hospital security and labor floor too. I've read many posts like these on Reddit and sometimes, shit goes south.", "NTA.  It's none of MIL'S business how your daughter handles her, emphasis on her, pregnancy.  Much less giving the child away or to be pressured into it.  It's between the father of the child and your daughter.", "NTA - I will say though maybe look into getting a restraining order against MIL and SIL. Who knows what lengths they\u2019ll go to get a baby?", "NTA - MIL totally did it while you weren\u2019t home cause she knew what you\u2019d say and do.", "NTA. I would never allow her on my property again. Ever. For me, there are lines  that no one is allowed to cross. There's no forgiveness.", "NTA.\nI feel for your SIL but your MIL is disgusting to try and manipulate a young mother out of her baby. Absolutely foul.\nMIL has no business being around your children if this is how she's going to behave.", "NTA.  MIL was completely out of line and acting selfish. Good Job, protecting your daughter.  \n\nI was a teen mother, and with the help of my mother, I graduated high school and college and raised my son on my own. There was no failure.  We make mistakes, and how we handle them is what makes us who we are.  Your daughter made a mistake but it sounds like she is already trying to make it right, keep supporting her and while it will be hard, it won't be impossible.", "NTA...I hope your husband continues the support. Way to go mom/grandma!", "Nta be careful  on redditt there are a lot of posts of family members calling cpswith false accusations  to try to take child away for themselves.  keep mil and sil away from your daughter.", "NTA good job mom", "NTA, your MIL sounds like a total asshole. Don't let her guilt trip you into giving up your daughter's baby.", "Your MIL absolutely overstepped and dogged on you in your own house. She also let out what she actually thinks of you to your daughter. Good on you for being supportive to your daughter.", "NTA perhaps you should have suggested BIL divorce SIL and then it would open up the opportunity for BIL to marry a fertile woman, that\u2019s an equally audacious suggestion.", "MIL is way out of line.  NTA.  If it were me, MIL would never set foot in my house again.  Nor would I allow contact between her and my kids.  Complete no contact.  SIL can adopt from somewhere else.", "NTA. If your SIL wants a child so bad. There are enough kids in need of adoption tbh. This was just plain wrong and kind of a power-move in my opinion.", "NTA. \nAnd kudos for sticking up for your daughter!", "NTA. Your MIL is trying to push your daughter to do something the daughter doesn\u2019t want to benefit a third person. MIL doesn\u2019t actually have your daughter\u2019s best interest at heart, as she has a conflict of interest between what\u2019s best for her daughter and what\u2019s best for your daughter. Keep her away.", "NTA", "SIL can adopt - outside the family smh... Not poach a baby FFS!", "It's not a real question is it.", "NTA. Not that it would make it better, but not even your daughter\u2019s grandmother. Way out of line.", "I'll never understand how the people in these stories are so quick to commodify a baby. Babies aren't to be passed out like fruitcakes or borrowed lawnmowers.\n\nNTA", "You are NTA.  Support your daughter!  And, if your Mother in Law is trying to coerce her minor granddaughter into giving up her child against her will, that is veering into human trafficking territory.  Deep waters.  Protect your child and grandchild-to-be.  Your daughter has a right to make her own informed choices about her child and parenting.", "NTA your job is to protect your children and you did that. It took nine years for us to get our son (now 1) so the infertility journey is still pretty fresh. NONE OF THIS IS OK. I have no idea if your SIL had any part in this and the grief is heavy when you\u2019re in the thick of it but like I said this isn\u2019t ok. They all need to get help if this is the kind of behaviour they\u2019re resorting to. \n\nYour MIL has way overstepped any rational boundary. Her son\u2019s house? It\u2019s your family home. It\u2019s just as much yours and your children\u2019s. Do not let these people into your home. Definitely do not let them near a pregnant teen who is probably very vulnerable and stressed about the future. Do not let them near that baby! \n\nHer infertility isn\u2019t anyone else\u2019s responsibility.", "NTA. Can't call dibs on someone else's baby.", "NTA! How dare she! I do wonder if your SIL knows of this plan?", "Just realized the MIL isn\u2019t even your directly related to your daughter. Not like that disqualifies someone from being a real and great grandparent, but sure adds weight to seeming like she only has her own daughter\u2019s interest in mind in this case. She was already absolutely the AH here but that kind of adds to how far she\u2019s crossing the line imo", "NTA - That\u2019s your daughter\u2019s baby. She wants to raise her baby, not give him/her up for adoption. MIL has already been told this. Good for you for backing up your daughter and not letting MIL try to manipulate her.", "NTA. If SIL wants to be a mom that bad, there are tons of kids waiting and hoping to be adopted.", "NTA. as sad as your SIL\u2019s situation is, your daughter is not an incubator at the service of infertile women. I find it deeply disturbing that they went behind your back to try and convince her, by degrading her no less.\nyes your daughter is very young to be a mother - but she seems to have a supportive family and a support system is all she needs.", "I would have slapped the shit out of her and then kicked her out.

You are taking a baby from the only person that baby has ever known or been with.  Whether the child remembers that or not, it is traumatic to go through, and that\u2019s just the baby.

Not only would it be awful for your daughter's mental health, but it likely would be so confusing and upsetting when the child found out down the road.", "Absolutely NTA. Your daughter and the father are already working hard to take care of this baby. They're being more responsible than most full grown adults. Good on you for supporting her. I had a child at 18.
