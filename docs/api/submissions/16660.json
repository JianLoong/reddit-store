While we began to discuss our careers, we've also become friends who debate whether or not we could 'have it all' and how to balance ambition and family.\n\nA while back, our friend brought an acquaintance \"Mandy\" to join and if I'm honest - I  became very annoyed by her. Mandy works at a dysfunctional job, supports her deadbeat boyfriend who treats her like a piggy bank, and seems to always be taken advantage of by her family, coworkers, and friends. Despite our constant encouragement, coaching, and job recommendations Mandy can't seem to set boundaries and advocate for herself or take our suggestion of therapy seriously. When one of us moderates the discussion to move on, Mandy will get teary eyed, baby voiced, and apologize for 'being a burden'.\n\nIt became a herculean effort for me to not snap at her when she did that.\n\nA month ago, I sent out a group e-mail saying I can't make the group anymore due to time constraints and that I wish everyone the best. I am the first woman to decide to leave the group. One friend \"Kate\" reached out and in private I told her that it got to a point where I dread going and having to hear Mandy talk about how depressed she is and how nothing in her life is going well. Kate listened to me and confided that she also felt like she lacked compassion and was a 'bad feminist' for not being able to hold space for Mandy.\n\nWe made plans to hang out and when we did Kate showed up with everyone from the women's group except for Mandy. We've been meeting again, and to my understanding everyone just white lied about obligations to Mandy.

You're within your rights to exclude her and go back to the original purpose of the group", "Honestly I\u2019d say NTA. Mandy clearly couldn\u2019t handle the nature of the group. She was treating it as a therapy session by the sounds of things, and the fact that it was her \u201conly suppprt system\u201d shows she clearly got comfortable in complaining to you all without having to do any self reflection. Mandy was unable to mold to the group and so you took the initiative to move away and everyone followed. You\u2019re right.", "NTA. Your group never set out to be a \"support group.\" You were a group of women meeting to discuss topics of interest to all of you. Mandy chose to interpret the group as her support group, and take up a lot of time with her personal issues. She needs a therapist,  not a discussion group. Do not feel guilty about disbanding the group in the way you did, it was probably the kindest way to do it.", "NTA, and I\u2019d like to see another marginalised group who are expected to spend their precious time listening to one member of that group whine about things that are at best tangentially related to membership of that group. Shitty jobs and leeching partners aren\u2019t inherently a feminist issue just because they\u2019re the problems a woman is having. But, women are expected to be everyone\u2019s mommy and *for some reason* reddit can relate more to the person who complains relentlessly about bullshit than the victims of these energy vampires.\n\nEdit: aw man, now I look like one of those people who comes in hot acting like they have an unpopular opinion. I swear when I posted this it was 90% YTAs.", "NTA. You are not her therapist or her crutch. People who are constantly negative are draining.", "NtA because it seems that she needs a different type of group..you all are there to equally share and I myself wouldnt like being part of a group that seems to be for one person to come and dump all their issues all the time and tries to make everyone feel guilty for moving the conversation away from the one person's constant complaining...she needs more eof like an emotional support group...", "NTA - It sounds like you all gave Mandy time and attention, however, she was/is unable to move herself forward. Unless you\u2019re a therapist, who would want to listen to her problems on and on. Sounds like Mandy is addicted to her drama. I would walk away too , in the same way that you did. I certainly wouldn\u2019t say to Mandy, sorry but we\u2019re all tired of listening to you complain about your unhappy life.", "NTA it sounds like Mandy prefers playing the victim to taking the steps to make her life better.", "NTA, you can\u2019t help someone who won\u2019t help themselves. I would also find it extremely frustrating being around this woman.", "NTA. I identify more with Mandy than with OP. Realising that I was just a walking ball of negativity to the point that my relationships were being affected and people didn't like hanging out with me anymore was a wake up call I hope Mandy takes. It's a burden to be the recipient of negativity and it is only healthy to disassociate from a situation you can't help and is weighing you down.", "NTA\n\nI'm so unbelievably confused by all the people claiming op is a bad feminist or abandoned the support group.\n\nThere is no support group. There is no feminist movement on their end.. \n\nIt's a group of like minded individuals getting together regularly to discuss their lives and careers. And sometimes, shock, the fact that they're women and their lives as women.\n\nMandy refuses to be helped or help herself. She's emotional draining. Even her own friend, the one that invited her, doesn't want her there anymore. You can't keep helping someone that's drowning when they're refusing to stand up.\n\nYeah it sucks you couldn't tell her she's exhausting to her face but.. idk I've done the exact same thing. \n\nReddit saw the word feminism and went into a roid rage.", "NTA\n\nI think the balance has been restored here. I'm not sure if this was the best way, but it was an attempt at bringing balance and an attempt at being kind and subtle about it.\n\nI wouldn't sweat over it. \"Mandy\" is going to \"Mandy\" wherever she goes, and lack of responses from each of you will encourage her to move on.\n\nI would be wary of bringing anyone else into your group in future. I know I've been an absolute sucker for the \"Mandy\" types before and have been burned and all but lit on fire for it in a few cases.\n\nEach one of you in your women's group could have your vulnerable moment and bring another Mandy-bomb in to blow up the group, so perhaps have some sort of pre-arrangement prior to including unknowns in future so your own group health gets factored in.\n\nI'm never really sure how to navigate these things either. If I'm direct, the Mandy-types lose their marbles. If I'm subtle, Mandy-types lose their marbles. The only way you don't get backlash from the Mandys of the world is to serve them the way that they want to be served, which just isn't going to be in the cards. So, picking your path to separate yourself from Mandy with as little Mandy drama as possible should be the desired path.\n\nIf there is a secret decoder ring to this mess, I'd be all ears.", "NTA. You guys gave her a chance, seems like she was a bad fit and kind of a desperate hanger on. We\u2019ve all met people like this.

That was a little bit of an AH move.", "NTA. \n\n>When one of us moderates the discussion to move on, Mandy will get teary eyed, baby voiced, and apologize for 'being a burden'.\n\nThis is emotional manipulation. Mandy won't do jack shit to better her situation, but she'll sure as hell use it to get pity. You're not an AH for not wanting to be manipulated in your happy time. She IS being a burden. Not for having issues, or even for having trouble leading these situations, but for treating a friend group like a support group that's solely there for her.", "This one is actually tough\u2026.On one hand, it\u2019s definitely an awful thing to do to someone on paper.

I really get it. \n\nI am going to say NAH. People are/can be emotionally draining and it really should not be anyone\u2019s responsibility to carry someone else\u2019s burden when it genuinely feels like an imposition. When my emotional boundaries are crossed it gets to a point where it feels like a violation, and sometimes you just have to protect your own energy. She also is really hurting and is clearly not reached the point in her journey where she is ready to face the fact that she is strong enough to make the tough choices that are required to improve her circumstances. That is a hard place to be in\u2014I\u2019ve been there. It took time. She likely already knows everything you guys have tried to tell her, but making choices like that is actually terrifying and it takes real emotional strength sometimes. \n\nIf you just don\u2019t want to be her friend anymore, it is what it is and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for it. \n\nIf you do feel badly and want to reach out to her, I would suggest a little honesty. Tell her that you DO care about her and want to support her, but you are struggling emotionally with the fact that it does drain you sometimes. A real friend will eventually hear what you\u2019re saying, and a friend who is just using you as an emotional crutch might not.", "This is actually a really tough one, but I\u2019m going to go with NAH.  It seems she\u2019s just such an emotional vampire that she\u2019s draining all of the rest of you.  I also do feel bad for her though as she\u2019s clearly miserable, but if it\u2019s so bad that the group doesn\u2019t even want to exist anymore, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re obligated to include her.  It seems you tried but couldn\u2019t make it work.\n\nAnother possible option might be monthly meetings with her and weekly meetings with the others that she doesn\u2019t know about so she has some level of support but in a way that you can all handle without her needs drowning out the rest.", "Question... is the friend who originally brought Mandy still in the group and if so are they now avoiding her too?", "You all had an\n**Advice**/discussion/philosophy/general women's topics group.

I got tired of it.\n\nWhy on earth do people in these comments think you were Mandy's friend?  She joined your group via a member that is or was friends with her. You all tried to help her in her career, which was the purpose of your group, and she blew you all off. She probably hurt your network when she skipped the meeting she requested.

The baby voice, the worries about being a burden, unable to stand up for herself in her relationship, struggles with her career, struggles with setting boundaries. \n\nShe\u2019s basically a walking example of the consequences of misogyny, so for you guys to not pick up on that and not have any patience for her is just really really really funny lol. A feminist group cutting a woman out for struggling with patriarchy. Incredible. I needed this today. \n\nYea YTA probably.

If it\u2019s not the time and place to be talking about her struggles then just say that, communicate with her like an adult.

I\u2019ve been a part of several groups of this type of group over the years and it\u2019s always a matter of time before a Mandy shows up.

But a Mandy doesn\u2019t need extra support for just a week or month or two, they need it forever. And these types of groups are not meant as a substitute for actual therapy which Mandy needs. \nI do think the best policy is to simply tell them that your group is able to provide the level of support they require and suggest they seek out therapy.

She's not able to leave her deadbeat boyfriend or to stop others taking advantage of her for the same reason that you weren't able to tell Mandy that she's an unbearable burden who is destroying your group - it's just immensely difficult to disappoint someone like that. Unfortunately, I don't think there is an easy solution to this problem (other than maintaining the lie about the group disbanding), but I think the best route would be to tell Mandy that the purpose of the group was not to be her support system, that you're not willing to let it be coopted for that purpose, and that the sole form of support that you will be willing to provide her is working though any external barriers (i.e. financial, as opposed to internal barriers like her attitude) to her getting a professional support system (i.e. therapy).\n\n(And it sounds like a Schema therapist would be helpful to her.

The group could've given her information about how to become a strong female and live her life for herself and not to take abuse.

Womanly advice like leave him he's killing you in so many ways and name; them.  Then you hold her accountable; for instance if you suggest something she should put into affect before the next meeting, you asked her if she did it and how it went.

It seems like you  feel guilty about this, It's just feels 'icky' because it's exactly like you said; you are excluding her behind her back. It feels like you're hiding this, like you're doing something that you're not supposed to, that this is like a middle school drama. You are grown adults and you can handle this maturely. \n\nIt always sucks to be isolated. Imagine yourself in her shoes: the people you thought were your friends suddenly ghost you and hang out together behind your back. It'll be better if you had a mature talk with Mandy about the situation or maybe even set an ultimatum. Let her know that everyone is tired about hearing her complain and that you feel like you're her therapists; tell her to get her own. Like \" don't talk to us about this problem unless you fix this or try what we suggested.\" You could also make a theme about what the topic for the next meeting is. For example, \"we will be meeting to talk about politics\" and as soon as she starts dumping her problems on you all, direct back to the topic. Try to refuse to start talking about it or change the subject. \n\nThat said, I don't think it's wrong to not hang out with her. You do you, you're not her babysitter; you're not obliged to hang out with someone you don't want. Heavens, especially if that person is emotionally draining.

You cannot make the people around you feel guilty for that anguish.

I love that the internet can open up a community for almost anyone who needs to vent or talk when they have no one.

I was left on my own.", "Many many years ago, I welcomed a woman into my kid/family/activities social circle. And every time I saw her, she would launch into a litany of complaints about how she and her child were being treated and how everything was never good enough or sensitive enough or enough. Once, and only once I said \u201cYou know what I need right now? For once, I need you to say hi, it\u2019s nice to see you, how are you?\u201d She started crying, was mortified, called her husband over to tell him what I said. Her husband (wtf ?) apologized profusely, said let\u2019s get together just our families soon, we\u2019ll host, blah, blah, blah.\nIt was the last time she ever spoke to me. They disappeared from my life.  Looking back, I thought there\u2019s a reason she\u2019s so disconnected and it wasn\u2019t because she was a busy professional working woman with limited chances to build community. She had a lousy personality. I suspect I wasn\u2019t the first person who pointed it out.", "It seems like Mandy needs more support than you all can offer or inclined to offer. I would be up front with her as gently as possible, and recommend she see a mental health professional. And discuss her rejoining the group after she's made some changes to help herself. You all may not be able to help her in the way that you all help each other but there's certainly some support that can be given to Mandy.", "NTA. While I think learning how to set boundaries is both personal and professional and this would have been an ideal time to practice, you aren't obligated to tell someone you have no interest in spending time with them. It sounds like you attempted to give her good advice, but did anyone ever just try being honest with her and ask her to either read the room and stop dominating the group or to please stop coming? Not that it matters. This woman is clearly incapable of picking up on clear cues or boundaries. That can be exhausting.", "Your edit might be the key:.  Mandy wants a support group, and that's not you.  \n\nYou would be doing her a kindness if you told her that, but I can understand why you might not want to open that door.   She sounds like might be a professional victim....?", "NTA and thank you for the links.", "I am part of an open support group for people of all genders (but mainly geared towards women). The leadership in the group always emphasize that a support group cannot just be about dumping or it will be pointless and a waste of your time.\n\n1. Your group is not an emotional support group\n2. Even if it is, Mandy just wants to dump. She doesn't want to take advice, she doesn't want to take active steps to improve her situation. She has consistently ignored the advice of the group. After a while, that is tiring. \n\nNTA", "I think mandy is just using you as free therapy and not really interested in discussions as much as venting to you", "Hey, so I just started running a book club\u2026\n\nI take less than two minutes to talk a bit about how what we read relates to my life and then I encourage others to do the same. It\u2019s usually \u2018 this part of the book really made me question x or think about y, did anyone else have a similar experience\u2019\n\nIs this appropriate? I have autism and your comment made me think I might be doing something that\u2019s not socially acceptable.\n\nThank you!", "I feel you. My book group was a victim of its own success because it started out so great, super focussed on actual reading and book discussion, and then people stupidly talked about it how they had a great time. Never talk about book group! More people started asking to come along and those people were not as good at book discussion at all. There was one person who was just constantly \"I didn't like this book because the main character did not behave like me\". \n\nThe problem was, that person was a very dedicated reader, and never missed a meeting and the rest of us just could not even after a while. We liked her as a person, though, and she was also our vet, so we couldn't burn the bridge of the friendship, sadly.", "My book club nearly hit a similar wall with someone who turned every. single. conversation. into either a digression on her favourite subjects (if I ever have to hear the words \"Warrior Cats\" again, I'm going to have a full-blown Manchurian Candidate style freakout) or how she thought the book we'd picked was \"problematic\" because the characters didn't all turn to the reader and elucidate their thoughts on feminism/anti-racism/whatever other -ism. She once told me that a book I'd picked read like a school shooter's manifesto because it had a female villain. She'd also turn on the waterworks if we told her - gently! - that her behaviour needed to change. It was exhausting.", "Agreed. There might have been a better way to handle this, but frankly it\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to find it. OP was honest without being unkind, direct without being unnecessarily harsh.", "Plus she sounds like someone who wants to be the victim constantly, possibly for the attention. If she\u2019s not taking on board the suggestions she\u2019s been offered or trying to help herself in anyway then she\u2019s going to go thru friends constantly.", "Seems like Mandy might even have the sexist idea that women\u2019s spaces exist to nurture and take care of emotional needs.", "^THIS. It\u2019s not y\u2019all\u2019s job to make her feel better emotionally, even if you\u2019ve already tried and she hasn\u2019t listened. You removed yourself before you did anything directly mean to her, and the others all felt the same. NTA", "I think groups like this are a waste of time but even then I feel like not inviting her defeats the point. If the whole point of feminism is empowering women and working towards equality then banning Mandy from the group is hypocritical", "Thank you for the term Energy Vampires- feels pretty spot on \ud83d\ude01", "I'm pretty sure every marginalised group has to deal with this sort of issue, certainly I've seen it constantly in queer activist spaces and heard about it from Black organisers I know. It's not inherently a feminist issue to have to deal with emotional vampires, though obviously it does have specific intersections with that, as do leeching partners and shitty jobs. \n\nAll sorts of activist spaces have to navigate people who think being social justice oriented means everything being about their personal drama and think it's against the core beliefs of the group to be shut down, and I've seen a lot of \"but they need compassion and isn't that what activism is about???\" Doesn't need to be the Oppression Olympics for the YTAs here to be bad takes, though I understand going there where you're seeing a lot of those.\n\nHaving said that, I think it's ESH because it's intensely childish to go behind this woman's back.", "Agreed. Also, she\u2019s going to stay wherever she is allowed to whine and not be expected to take responsibility. Some problem wonder why they attract toxic people. The answer is that toxic people love people who are helpful and listen, but stay because they aren\u2019t booted for their toxic behavior.", "Reading some of those comments it has become clear that a lot of people have no idea what feminism actually means.", "This is the comment I've been looking for!", "Very well said!", "This isn't a support group for women.", "Mandy is invested in the boyfriend so it would be worth it for her to put in the work of learning to set boundaries, but OP and the other group members were never invested in Mandy. She loves her boyfriend but they don't love her. \n\nThis is a group of women who have kids and jobs and not much social time. They advised her to seek therapy and may have dropped other hints.

And yet, it apparently didn't fit the bill.\n\nThe whole thing reeks of the same energy as when someone asks you how your day is going, but then....if you tell the truth, and not just the nicety answer of...\"It's going fine.\", even if it's not, then they don't actually care and instead get annoyed at you for answering truthfully.\n\nIn that way, it's not a social group. It's a socio-political echo chamber. Empathy not required.", "Because Mandy would turn it into a cry and drama fest.", "Yes. Exactly this. And they did not exclude her because she was negative. Everything she, Mandy, talked about, technically, fit into one of the categories OP mentioned. They excluded her because she wasn't a perfect girl boss feminist.", "I agree with all of this, and I honestly feel for Mandy. OP and the group needed to put on their big girl pants and have a rough conversation, but instead they took the easy way out.\n\nI've been there. When my depression was at its worst, I completely lost sight of myself and my identity, and it unfortunately made me somewhat self-absorbed and intense to be around. I truly was trying my best and I made intentional effort to respect my friends' boundaries, but I was also drowning and inches from falling off the deep end. There's only so much you can mask before that darkness seeps through and makes you a bummer and a burden.\n\nI had close friends cut me off out of nowhere, despite all my best efforts to communicate. They never even tried telling me what was wrong before deciding that I was too much to bother with. And if they had talked to me, I would have listened and tried to better myself. \n\nHaving some of my closest friends cut me off without warning during the darkest, most scary period of my life was absolutely traumatizing. 2 years later and I still don't forgive myself, which is nuts since I never even did anything truly wrong to warrant the guilt.\n\nEdit: Since I see I'm about to get downvoted a lot, I just want to clarify. OP's feelings are completely valid and the group has every right to cultivate a healthy social dynamic. Mandy obviously has issues, and something needed to change. But everyone offering hints and advice on how to change her life is not the same thing as actually sitting down and bluntly communicating how her attitude is affecting everyone.\n\nOn another note, I hate the \"nobody owes anyone anything\" mentality. It's kinda shitty, in my opinion. Yes, take care of yourself and your own happiness, but try to consider others and navigate conflicts with compassion and clarity.", "They are a group of women talking mostly about their careers and finance. \n\nHow is Mandy sobbing about her life every single time related to career or finance?", "How was OP hateful?", "NTA", "Honestly that sounds appropriate and fine! It's when the entire session becomes a vent session that things go south.", "Connecting it back to the book is key", "Personally, I want to talk about the book. I want to talk about how I feel about what happens, about the characters, about how the writer tells the story. I might, for example, if I were discussing Bill Bryson's *A Walk in the Woods*, mention that every time I read it I feel like I want to walk the Appalachian Trail. Or that I have read a few of the books he mentions in that book solely because he mentioned them. But I'm not going to want to talk about how someone in someone's life resembles the character of Katz. Honestly, most books don't inspire that kind of connection to people or events in my own life.", "My kid is in a book club online.

It took too many years for me to start upholding healthy boundaries. Luckily I moved away so cutting these people out of my life has been much easier than if I would have stayed.

Going to therapy, getting my diagnosis, and actively working on myself got me to a much better place.  \n\nI agree that it sounds like some things could have been better communicated to Mandy which is why I was asking for more info. But now that I see OP's comments that include things like Mandy blowing off a meeting with a professional contact of OP because her bf was sick and she made soup... yeah no. OP is NTA, and it's clear Mandy was not taking the steps she needed. This circle was not her good friends; it was a group of professional women she was introduced to. The biggest AH was Mandy's friend that introduced her to the group but apparently made no real effort to address the issues they all were having with her and then joined the second group.", "The problem with the whole concept of holding space for depressed or struggling friends is a hard one. \n\nOn the one hand , you have absolutely got to be a decent human being to your circle , within your capacity.

The ones who seem to be thriving mentally are only doing so by living their lives in  very specific ways that has worked for them. \n\nThere isn't enough joy and peace and calm in this world for many to hold space for those struggling without it impacting their own delicate  balance of good mental health. \n\nIt's an awful thing to think about but it's true.
