You're within your rights to exclude her and go back to the original purpose of the group", "Honestly I\u2019d say NTA. Mandy clearly couldn\u2019t handle the nature of the group. She was treating it as a therapy session by the sounds of things, and the fact that it was her \u201conly suppprt system\u201d shows she clearly got comfortable in complaining to you all without having to do any self reflection. Mandy was unable to mold to the group and so you took the initiative to move away and everyone followed. You\u2019re right.", "NTA. Your group never set out to be a \"support group.\" You were a group of women meeting to discuss topics of interest to all of you. Mandy chose to interpret the group as her support group, and take up a lot of time with her personal issues. She needs a therapist,  not a discussion group. Do not feel guilty about disbanding the group in the way you did, it was probably the kindest way to do it.", "NTA, and I\u2019d like to see another marginalised group who are expected to spend their precious time listening to one member of that group whine about things that are at best tangentially related to membership of that group. Shitty jobs and leeching partners aren\u2019t inherently a feminist issue just because they\u2019re the problems a woman is having. But, women are expected to be everyone\u2019s mommy and *for some reason* reddit can relate more to the person who complains relentlessly about bullshit than the victims of these energy vampires.", "NTA. You are not her therapist or her crutch. People who are constantly negative are draining.", "NtA because it seems that she needs a different type of group..you all are there to equally share and I myself wouldnt like being part of a group that seems to be for one person to come and dump all their issues all the time and tries to make everyone feel guilty for moving the conversation away from the one person's constant complaining...she needs more eof like an emotional support group...", "NTA - It sounds like you all gave Mandy time and attention, however, she was/is unable to move herself forward. Unless you\u2019re a therapist, who would want to listen to her problems on and on. Sounds like Mandy is addicted to her drama. I would walk away too , in the same way that you did. I certainly wouldn\u2019t say to Mandy, sorry but we\u2019re all tired of listening to you complain about your unhappy life.", "NTA it sounds like Mandy prefers playing the victim to taking the steps to make her life better.", "NTA, you can\u2019t help someone who won\u2019t help themselves. I would also find it extremely frustrating being around this woman.", "NTA. I identify more with Mandy than with OP. Realising that I was just a walking ball of negativity to the point that my relationships were being affected and people didn't like hanging out with me anymore was a wake up call I hope Mandy takes. It's a burden to be the recipient of negativity and it is only healthy to disassociate from a situation you can't help and is weighing you down.", "NTA\n\nI'm so unbelievably confused by all the people claiming op is a bad feminist or abandoned the support group.\n\nThere is no support group. There is no feminist movement on their end.. \n\nIt's a group of like minded individuals getting together regularly to discuss their lives and careers. And sometimes, shock, the fact that their women and their lives as women.\n\nMandy refuses to be helped or help herself. She's emotional draining. Even her own friend, the one that invited her, doesn't want her there anymore. You can't keep helping someone that's drowning when they're refusing to stand up.\n\nYeah it sucks you couldn't tell her she's exhausting to her face but.. idk I've done the exact same thing. \n\nReddit saw the word feminism and went into a roid rage.", "NTA\n\nI think the balance has been restored here. I'm not sure if this was the best way, but it was an attempt at bringing balance and an attempt at being kind and subtle about it.\n\nI wouldn't sweat over it. \"Mandy\" is going to \"Mandy\" wherever she goes, and lack of responses from each of you will encourage her to move on.\n\nI would be weary of bringing anyone else into your group in future. I know I've been an absolute sucker for the \"Mandy\" types before and have been burned and all but lit on fire for it in a few cases.\n\nEach one of you in your women's group could have your vulnerable moment and bring another Mandy-bomb in to blow up the group, so perhaps have some sort of pre-arrangement prior to including unknowns in future so your own group health gets factored in.\n\nI'm never really sure how to navigate these things either. If I'm direct, the Mandy-types lose their marbles. If I'm subtle, Mandy-types lose their marbles. The only way you don't get backlash from the Mandys of the world is to serve them the way that they want to be served, which just isn't going to be in the cards. So, picking your path to separate yourself from Mandy with as little Mandy drama as possible should be the desired path.\n\nIf there is a secret decoder ring to this mess, I'd be all ears.", "NTA. You guys gave her a chance, seems like she was a bad fit and kind of a desperate hanger on. We\u2019ve all met people like this.

You are not an emotional support group. Simple.\nOn the other hand I do feel that you all should have clearly communicated your incompatibility with her. That was a little bit of an AH move.", "NTA. \n\n>When one of us moderates the discussion to move on, Mandy will get teary eyed, baby voiced, and apologize for 'being a burden'.\n\nThis is emotional manipulation. Mandy won't do jack shit to better her situation, but she'll sure as hell use it to get pity. You're not an AH for not wanting to be manipulated in your happy time. She IS being a burden. Not for having issues, or even for having trouble leading these situations, but for treating a friend group like a support group that's solely there for her.", "This one is actually tough\u2026.On one hand, it\u2019s definitely an awful thing to do to someone on paper. On the other hand\u2014I, too, have friends that simply drain me emotionally and it takes active work that almost feels physical to hold enough space for them, and I don\u2019t always have it in me to do it every time. I really get it. \n\nI am going to say NAH. People are/can be emotionally draining and it really should not be anyone\u2019s responsibility to carry someone else\u2019s burden when it genuinely feels like an imposition. When my emotional boundaries are crossed it gets to a point where it feels like a violation, and sometimes you just have to protect your own energy. She also is really hurting and is clearly not reached the point in her journey where she is ready to face the fact that she is strong enough to make the tough choices that are required to improve her circumstances. That is a hard place to be in\u2014I\u2019ve been there. It took time. She likely already knows everything you guys have tried to tell her, but making choices like that is actually terrifying and it takes real emotional strength sometimes. \n\nIf you just don\u2019t want to be her friend anymore, it is what it is and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for it. \n\nIf you do feel badly and want to reach out to her, I would suggest a little honesty. Tell her that you DO care about her and want to support her, but you are struggling emotionally with the fact that it does drain you sometimes. A real friend will eventually hear what you\u2019re saying, and a friend who is just using you as an emotional crutch might not.", "This is actually a really tough one, but I\u2019m going to go with NAH.  It seems she\u2019s just such an emotional vampire that she\u2019s draining all of the rest of you.  I also do feel bad for her though as she\u2019s clearly miserable, but if it\u2019s so bad that the group doesn\u2019t even want to exist anymore, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re obligated to include her.  It seems you tried but couldn\u2019t make it work.\n\nAnother possible option might be monthly meetings with her and weekly meetings with the others that she doesn\u2019t know about so she has some level of support but in a way that you can all handle without her needs drowning out the rest.", "Question... is the friend who originally brought Mandy still in the group and if so are they now avoiding her too?", "You all had a discussion/philosophy/general women's topics group. Mandy showed up and turned it into a therapy group. All of you don't want or need that and don't have an obligation to listen to Mandy complain that her own actions result in bad outcomes. \n\nMandy needs to get an actual support system not hijack another group. Even if you all had been a quasi-support group, support groups and therapy groups are not the same thing. She joined and changed the dynamic and no one else liked it so you guys set up the group as it was originally. NTA.\n\nEven if you were a feminist group that doesn't mean you have to hold another woman's hand twice a week, every week, while she blows off all assistance and help offered. \n\nI dropped feminism because I don't want to support all women in everything they do because there's some stuff I don't support and I felt feminism was being used against women by men too much.

But you also can\u2019t act like an evolved group of feminists lol. Everything she seems to be struggling with is easily traced back to misogyny and the pressures of women on society. The baby voice, the worries about being a burden, unable to stand up for herself in her relationship, struggles with her career, struggles with setting boundaries. \n\nShe\u2019s basically a walking example of the consequences of misogyny, so for you guys to not pick up on that and not have any patience for her is just really really really funny lol. A feminist group cutting a woman out for struggling with patriarchy. Incredible. I needed this today. \n\nYea YTA probably. You don\u2019t have to slap a feminist label on you guys, it\u2019s okay to just be a group of women who want to hangout. You don\u2019t have to justify it lol.

If it\u2019s not the time and place to be talking about her struggles then just say that, communicate with her like an adult.

Honestly though, it might be better for her to find more decent people than you guys.", "YTA - None of *you* were adult enough to set boundaries with Mandy and steer the conversation away from her.

That *doesn\u2019t mean* you let her railroad the conversation every time, and that *doesn\u2019t mean* you can\u2019t set boundaries with her. You can be supportive while being honest.

Did you ever discuss these things with the woman who invited her into the group? Did the woman who invited her in join the new group?\n\nOverall, I'm going to say NTA because it sounds like she was using this as her therapy rather than utilizing other resources to get appropriate mental health help.

But the way you described it sounds like some serious middle school sh*t. I think you\u2019re talking out of both sides of your mouth by hyping up these girl boss/feminist/politics meetups while also being too cowardly to be honest (and kind) to Mandy about it.

Did you expect her to quit her job, leave her deadbeat boyfriend and completely transform her life immediately, in the short time you met her? \n\nSeems like what she really needed was for her friends to see her as a person rather than a project and to accept her, even if her life experiences didn't exactly match your own.

Its a new thing. Its going to be a hit", "We have communicated clearly with her. We've brought the conversation back on topic when she starts to derail. We've asked her if she wanted advice or for us to listen. We've asked her how she wants to be helped. We've looked over her resume, given her warm intro's to better jobs, suggested support networks, and therapy.  \n\n\nMy personal breaking point was when she asked for an intro to someone in my professional network and then never showed up to the meeting. Her excuse was that her boyfriend wasn't feeling well so she stayed home to make him soup and that I wasn't being compassionate enough to her situation.  \n\n\nFrankly after reading some of the comments I'm ok with being the asshole and will discuss closing the group.", "How is it a support group? It's friends getting together to discuss their career.", "It sounds like she needed attention. They gave her support and she just took it and changed nothing, eventually you just want to give up.", "The OP says the group is an informal group of women friends who meet to have regular discussions to help process the world through a women's lens, not a support group.", "Right? Lol I thought women hated when men did that and tried changing them or telling them how to do things and giving unsolicited advice aka mansplaining. Guess it's fine for them to do it to each other though.", "They tried to help her but she preferred to just continue to struggle and complain.", "Since Mandy wasn't willing to do any work, not sure what you expected the group to do.", "It sounds like they did and Mandy didn't go. These people don't want help, they want to be admired for suffering.", "OP states that their suggestions of therapy were not taken seriously.", "I agree with you there, I guess I\u2019d assumed they\u2019d already said something. Good point!", "Yup. Its not a therapy or support group. It's a career group. Nobody can discuss and solve problems in their own career while mandy takes up all the time each session with her personal problems.         \nMandy needs to find a  support group for support, and stick to career talk in the career group.     \nAnd Mandy needs to learn that in a group, other people get to speak too.        \nI don't blame OP or the group one bit for not wanting her around.", "In the post it didn\u2019t even seem like OP identified the clear connection between societies expectations on women and how Mandy acts. She really shouldn\u2019t be discussing feminism with anyone lol.", "Meaning even the person who originally invited Mandy finds her emotionally exhausting.", "I feel like it\u2019s the responsibility of the friend who brought Mandy to deal w the Mandy of it all. Has she talked to her directly about the purpose of the group?", "Hope it goes smooth. I read your additional comments & responses and I think I understand more that group was not \u201cfeminist support\u201d group either, more like networking for women and topics such as \u201cnavigating career in male-oriented field\u201d come up. So some comments like you are not a real feminist! are bit off for this post, but when we use and hear a word \u201cfeminism\u201d, it means a lot to us, women, so I understand the voice, too (I think you do, too).\nAnd, Mandy not showing up for networking opportunity you set up is totally irresponsible to me, too. So not doing favor for her again makes sense. Glad you found several friends you can talk about life and work!", "I was mainly swayed by the earlier YTAs, but this rings true by the group's definition.\n\nNTA", "Thank you for confirming the rating :)\n\nEdit: you did not even have guts to tell that you are dropping her to her face...", "It's not a support group.", "Sounds like a support group to me. No one meets every week to \"process\" things for no reason. You are being intellectually dishonest.", "That\u2019s a support group lol", "Exactly. The first rule of feminism is never give women unsolicited advice. Just listen to them vent without inserting your opinions. OP is TA for giving rules to other ppl without applying them to herself.", "Ah, I see. I missed that. In that case, if they have tried communicating boundaries and mandy was just not taking it, then I change my judgment to NAH.", "I thought OP did say they suggested therapy and job leads.", "The insanity in this thread is rotting my brain. I love you so much, such an intelligent response.\n\nThank you", "No problem. Glad you're enjoying yourself here on the internet - send me that email when you have a chance k?", "Yes, there are people that meet on the regular to \"process\" things without the confines of a church lounge and a group label like Narcotics Anonymous. I can think of 4 groups that I am aware of in my social circle. All are populated by women. I assume that there are groups of men or mixed genders doing this as well, but I don't know of any of those first hand.", "That\u2019s not the first, or in fact any, rule of feminism. Feminism isn\u2019t about listening to people whine about things they won\u2019t change, even if that person is a woman.", "This group probably had a girl-boss type of \"feminism\" where it's about conforming to what they think a women should be and act like with a side of MLM \"hussle\"\n\nLike imagine saying you have a group to discuss feminism but then talk about dropping someone because they're not falling into the model of how you think they should act or respond.", "Yeah they basically did everything that women on reddit complain that men do constantly. Especially the inserting your opinions. We're told constantly to listen and not try to fix...", "Aww, I love you too!            \n Let's start a women's group. Discussing how bonkers some people on Reddit can be!       \nI make a mean strawberry daiquiri...", "why don't you send me Mandy's info so I can send to a nice restaurant since her supposed \"friends\" are bunch of A.", "I'm sorry, was Mandy your friend? Because I thought someone else introduced her into your group and you all tried your best.", "Yup its called a support group lmao", "Being a strong person means sacrificing your selfish desires to empower your family and your community. These \"strong feminists\" have a weekly book club to talk about their career moves and hot girl summer. Meanwhile the real strong woman is battling depression while supporting her lover, and these ladies cant handle it.", "They took it even farther. The men usually offer advice and leave it at that. These ladies literally got mad at the poor woman for not taking their advice and then they straight up kicked her out of the group and started meeting in secret. Like is this middle school? These are grown adults who literally have a weekly meeting to discuss how empowered and sophisticated they are, yet they act like emotional little children.", "LOL good luck. I've met people like this, they're exhausting.", "They aren\u2019t her friends. The woman who originally brought her was. The group did, however, embrace and try to help her. Ultimately Mandy is not a good fit for the mission of the group. They should not be forced to change how their group works, or it\u2019s focus, for one member who isn\u2019t in the same place in her life as the rest of them. NTA", "Suggesting jobs when all she wanted was to vent about how he felt \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f"]}
