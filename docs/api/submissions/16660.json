You're within your rights to exclude her and go back to the original purpose of the group", "Honestly I\u2019d say NTA. Mandy clearly couldn\u2019t handle the nature of the group. She was treating it as a therapy session by the sounds of things, and the fact that it was her \u201conly suppprt system\u201d shows she clearly got comfortable in complaining to you all without having to do any self reflection. Mandy was unable to mold to the group and so you took the initiative to move away and everyone followed. You\u2019re right.", "NTA. Your group never set out to be a \"support group.\" You were a group of women meeting to discuss topics of interest to all of you. Mandy chose to interpret the group as her support group, and take up a lot of time with her personal issues. She needs a therapist,  not a discussion group. Do not feel guilty about disbanding the group in the way you did, it was probably the kindest way to do it.", "NTA, and I\u2019d like to see another marginalised group who are expected to spend their precious time listening to one member of that group whine about things that are at best tangentially related to membership of that group. Shitty jobs and leeching partners aren\u2019t inherently a feminist issue just because they\u2019re the problems a woman is having. But, women are expected to be everyone\u2019s mommy and *for some reason* reddit can relate more to the person who complains relentlessly about bullshit than the victims of these energy vampires.\n\nEdit: aw man, now I look like one of those people who comes in hot acting like they have an unpopular opinion. I swear when I posted this it was 90% YTAs.", "NTA. You are not her therapist or her crutch. People who are constantly negative are draining.", "NtA because it seems that she needs a different type of group..you all are there to equally share and I myself wouldnt like being part of a group that seems to be for one person to come and dump all their issues all the time and tries to make everyone feel guilty for moving the conversation away from the one person's constant complaining...she needs more eof like an emotional support group...", "NTA - It sounds like you all gave Mandy time and attention, however, she was/is unable to move herself forward. Unless you\u2019re a therapist, who would want to listen to her problems on and on. Sounds like Mandy is addicted to her drama. I would walk away too , in the same way that you did. I certainly wouldn\u2019t say to Mandy, sorry but we\u2019re all tired of listening to you complain about your unhappy life.", "NTA it sounds like Mandy prefers playing the victim to taking the steps to make her life better.", "NTA, you can\u2019t help someone who won\u2019t help themselves. I would also find it extremely frustrating being around this woman.", "NTA. I identify more with Mandy than with OP. Realising that I was just a walking ball of negativity to the point that my relationships were being affected and people didn't like hanging out with me anymore was a wake up call I hope Mandy takes. It's a burden to be the recipient of negativity and it is only healthy to disassociate from a situation you can't help and is weighing you down.", "NTA\n\nI'm so unbelievably confused by all the people claiming op is a bad feminist or abandoned the support group.\n\nThere is no support group. There is no feminist movement on their end.. \n\nIt's a group of like minded individuals getting together regularly to discuss their lives and careers. And sometimes, shock, the fact that their women and their lives as women.\n\nMandy refuses to be helped or help herself. She's emotional draining. Even her own friend, the one that invited her, doesn't want her there anymore. You can't keep helping someone that's drowning when they're refusing to stand up.\n\nYeah it sucks you couldn't tell her she's exhausting to her face but.. idk I've done the exact same thing. \n\nReddit saw the word feminism and went into a roid rage.", "NTA\n\nI think the balance has been restored here. I'm not sure if this was the best way, but it was an attempt at bringing balance and an attempt at being kind and subtle about it.\n\nI wouldn't sweat over it. \"Mandy\" is going to \"Mandy\" wherever she goes, and lack of responses from each of you will encourage her to move on.\n\nI would be wary of bringing anyone else into your group in future. I know I've been an absolute sucker for the \"Mandy\" types before and have been burned and all but lit on fire for it in a few cases.\n\nEach one of you in your women's group could have your vulnerable moment and bring another Mandy-bomb in to blow up the group, so perhaps have some sort of pre-arrangement prior to including unknowns in future so your own group health gets factored in.\n\nI'm never really sure how to navigate these things either. If I'm direct, the Mandy-types lose their marbles. If I'm subtle, Mandy-types lose their marbles. The only way you don't get backlash from the Mandys of the world is to serve them the way that they want to be served, which just isn't going to be in the cards.

You guys gave her a chance, seems like she was a bad fit and kind of a desperate hanger on. We\u2019ve all met people like this.

That was a little bit of an AH move.", "NTA. \n\n>When one of us moderates the discussion to move on, Mandy will get teary eyed, baby voiced, and apologize for 'being a burden'.\n\nThis is emotional manipulation. Mandy won't do jack shit to better her situation, but she'll sure as hell use it to get pity. You're not an AH for not wanting to be manipulated in your happy time. She IS being a burden. Not for having issues, or even for having trouble leading these situations, but for treating a friend group like a support group that's solely there for her.", "This one is actually tough\u2026.On one hand, it\u2019s definitely an awful thing to do to someone on paper. On the other hand\u2014I, too, have friends that simply drain me emotionally and it takes active work that almost feels physical to hold enough space for them, and I don\u2019t always have it in me to do it every time. I really get it. \n\nI am going to say NAH. People are/can be emotionally draining and it really should not be anyone\u2019s responsibility to carry someone else\u2019s burden when it genuinely feels like an imposition. When my emotional boundaries are crossed it gets to a point where it feels like a violation, and sometimes you just have to protect your own energy. She also is really hurting and is clearly not reached the point in her journey where she is ready to face the fact that she is strong enough to make the tough choices that are required to improve her circumstances. That is a hard place to be in\u2014I\u2019ve been there. It took time. She likely already knows everything you guys have tried to tell her, but making choices like that is actually terrifying and it takes real emotional strength sometimes. \n\nIf you just don\u2019t want to be her friend anymore, it is what it is and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH for it. \n\nIf you do feel badly and want to reach out to her, I would suggest a little honesty. Tell her that you DO care about her and want to support her, but you are struggling emotionally with the fact that it does drain you sometimes. A real friend will eventually hear what you\u2019re saying, and a friend who is just using you as an emotional crutch might not.", "This is actually a really tough one, but I\u2019m going to go with NAH.  It seems she\u2019s just such an emotional vampire that she\u2019s draining all of the rest of you.  I also do feel bad for her though as she\u2019s clearly miserable, but if it\u2019s so bad that the group doesn\u2019t even want to exist anymore, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re obligated to include her.  It seems you tried but couldn\u2019t make it work.\n\nAnother possible option might be monthly meetings with her and weekly meetings with the others that she doesn\u2019t know about so she has some level of support but in a way that you can all handle without her needs drowning out the rest.", "Question... is the friend who originally brought Mandy still in the group and if so are they now avoiding her too?", "You all had an\n**Advice**/discussion/philosophy/general women's topics group.

I got tired of it.\n\nWhy on earth do people in these comments think you were Mandy's friend?  She joined your group via a member that is or was friends with her. You all tried to help her in her career, which was the purpose of your group, and she blew you all off. She probably hurt your network when she skipped the meeting she requested.

The baby voice, the worries about being a burden, unable to stand up for herself in her relationship, struggles with her career, struggles with setting boundaries. \n\nShe\u2019s basically a walking example of the consequences of misogyny, so for you guys to not pick up on that and not have any patience for her is just really really really funny lol. A feminist group cutting a woman out for struggling with patriarchy. Incredible. I needed this today. \n\nYea YTA probably.

If it\u2019s not the time and place to be talking about her struggles then just say that, communicate with her like an adult.

Did you expect her to quit her job, leave her deadbeat boyfriend and completely transform her life immediately, in the short time you met her? \n\nSeems like what she really needed was for her friends to see her as a person rather than a project and to accept her, even if her life experiences didn't exactly match your own.

I\u2019ve been a part of several groups of this type of group over the years and it\u2019s always a matter of time before a Mandy shows up. Every time everyone is very sympathetic at first, allowing them a bigger share of time and support because, after all, everyone goes through a rough time here and there and you\u2019d want to the extra support if you needed it. But a Mandy doesn\u2019t need extra support for just a week or month or two, they need it forever. And these types of groups are not meant as a substitute for actual therapy which Mandy needs. \nI do think the best policy is to simply tell them that your group is able to provide the level of support they require and suggest they seek out therapy.

Why did you instead all need to lie to her, and almost let this group, which you presumably all value immensely, disband just to be able to get out of the situation?\n\nI don't mean to ask this as a criticism of you, but more to highlight that the simple solutions that you were offering Mandy are actually very, very hard to implement. She's not able to leave her deadbeat boyfriend or to stop others taking advantage of her for the same reason that you weren't able to tell Mandy that she's an unbearable burden who is destroying your group - it's just immensely difficult to disappoint someone like that. Unfortunately, I don't think there is an easy solution to this problem (other than maintaining the lie about the group disbanding), but I think the best route would be to tell Mandy that the purpose of the group was not to be her support system, that you're not willing to let it be coopted for that purpose, and that the sole form of support that you will be willing to provide her is working though any external barriers (i.e. financial, as opposed to internal barriers like her attitude) to her getting a professional support system (i.e. therapy).\n\n(And it sounds like a Schema therapist would be helpful to her.

The hard but right thing to do would have been to communicate to Mandy that she needs to meet certain behavioral standards to remain in the group.

The group could've given her information about how to become a strong female and live her life for herself and not to take abuse. Instead of her saying she's a burden, you should give her constructive criticism to improve and change, to reach for what she wants and tell her ways to get there. Womanly advice like leave him he's killing you in so many ways and name; them.  Then you hold her accountable; for instance if you suggest something she should put into affect before the next meeting, you asked her if she did it and how it went. You tell her you're not there to be her mental or emotional support counselors, you all are there to improve your lives and if she can't get onboard she won't be welcome anymore. You could also suggest counseling for her. Tell her the truth.", "I'd say NTA.

Of course, it was not your initial intention to exclude her; you just didn't want to hang out. That's fine, you're NTA for that.\n\nWhat I think could be changed is how you currently handle the situation. It seems like you  feel guilty about this, It's just feels 'icky' because it's exactly like you said; you are excluding her behind her back. It feels like you're hiding this, like you're doing something that you're not supposed to, that this is like a middle school drama. You are grown adults and you can handle this maturely. \n\nIt always sucks to be isolated. Imagine yourself in her shoes: the people you thought were your friends suddenly ghost you and hang out together behind your back. It'll be better if you had a mature talk with Mandy about the situation or maybe even set an ultimatum. Let her know that everyone is tired about hearing her complain and that you feel like you're her therapists; tell her to get her own. Like \" don't talk to us about this problem unless you fix this or try what we suggested.\" You could also make a theme about what the topic for the next meeting is. For example, \"we will be meeting to talk about politics\" and as soon as she starts dumping her problems on you all, direct back to the topic. Try to refuse to start talking about it or change the subject. \n\nThat said, I don't think it's wrong to not hang out with her. You do you, you're not her babysitter; you're not obliged to hang out with someone you don't want. Heavens, especially if that person is emotionally draining.

There's a time and a place.\n\nI will say that depression is a condition that does cause some individuals to be very self-focused. Some people with depression do have trouble seeing things through other perspectives. (I have depression)\n\nMandy lacks coping skills and social skills, and I wouldn't even say it's her fault. Some people do need help in those areas. She needs professional support.", "OP e-mailed the group and said she couldn\u2019t meet with them again due to time constraints, so the group doesn\u2019t sound solely personal. Although the women developed a friendship, I think the purpose of this group is more professionally oriented (as opposed to a group of friends hanging out).", "Absolutely everything doesn\u2019t need to be about growth, but if they\u2019re asking if they\u2019re TA then it comes with the territory to mention if there is a better way this could have been handled", "She did. Mandy didn't take their advice and just wants to take up time and be all  \"poor me.\"", "I think they mean, that when Mandy was getting too personal and negative they should have held the boundaries firm that they only wanted to focus on certain subjects. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like anybody told Mandy she was taking up too much space. The therapy and job recommendations sound like suggestions to help her move forward in life  but they don\u2019t actually tell her that she\u2019s an issue.", "Who taught you that", "But what they did caused drama anyway.", "Right. Be specific and direct. Maybe Mandy misconstrued the group to be more of a support group, maybe she just vents to everyone. We don\u2019t really know, and can\u2019t assume. But given that she referenced it as her only support group i\u2019m gonna guess not. Most people who harp on everyone around them probably wouldn\u2019t be so bothered about this group ending & would just move on to the next person to vent to.", "It seems that Mandy would be better served by finding a counsellor or support group that would address her issues. Your group isn\u2019t a good fit. Do you know if this is the first time she has opened up regarding her troubles?  Maybe this is why she feels attached to the group, not really knowing what other places she could find this circle of support. Do you believe that she is sincere in wanting to make changes but maybe needs to make smaller steps? \n\nMaybe she is incapable of implementing the advice that you all have been offering. If you were inclined maybe she could be given some feedback along with some suggestions on resources in the community that could help her on her journey. That is your judgement call of course. NTA for not wanting her in your group\u2026but *maybe* YTA for blowing her off without any closure.", "This is a group for getting advice about your careers and navigating investments as a women. Just because you believe women should take on the burden of emotionally supporting everyone does not make it a support group. Someone who treats it as such does not understand the purpose of the group, thus does not belong. Maybe yall as men, clearly, should not define feminism.", "They got one email, that's not drama.", "Even if she did find a counselor...Mandy is going to need to want to change to see any improvements", "So if I join any random group that is woman based I should assume it's a support group and I should be able to show up and talk about my problems the whole time then cry if anyone changes the subject?"]}
