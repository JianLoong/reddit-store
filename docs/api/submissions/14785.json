She was subjected to being a parent figure to her younger siblings by her parents who were shitty and uninvolved parents to all four of them. Only difference was while my wife was forced to raise herself, she was forced to raise her siblings and she struggled with that. Her siblings view her as their mother. She did make sure they were okay but once she was 18 she refused to be all they had and they went into foster care due to the environment they were living in. My wife was forced to drop out of high school at 16 because she found it too much to handle and failed all her classes. At 18 she decided she needed to fight for her own future. This is part of why she made the decision to call CPS instead of raising her siblings. She got her GED and she got a degree at a community college. We met while she was in the middle of doing this. She told me all about her childhood and how tough it was for her.\n\nShe did see her siblings and stayed in their lives. They were sadly separated in foster care.\n\nThey are now 21, 22 and 24 years old. They also still see my wife as their mother. They were jealous when our children were born and my wife had to remove them from her life for a couple of years because they were angry at her for being a better mother to our first child than she was to them. Contact has been back for a little over a year now. They have not really changed. They made my wife feel guilty for pushing them aside instead of working on things. But then they make comment after comment about the effort she goes to for our kids and how she never did that for them, and said it was hurtful to call our son her oldest child, when she has them.\n\nMy wife has told me she doesn't know what to do because their childhoods messed up their perception of her. I told her I would speak to them next time. So they stopped by Easter Sunday and were saying to my wife they wanted her to get photos done with them and our kids, to show she's mom of all of them and they are just as much her kids as our children are. I told them to stop. That their sister is not their mom, she's their sister, she was a child just like they were and they are no longer children and they need to start treating my wife as their sister and not their mother who owed them a certain childhood. They told me I have no idea what I am talking about and stormed out.\n\nThis was the first time they left. My wife looked so relieved. But her siblings gave her a hard time afterward.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681484893, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12m0cwd/aita_for_telling_my_wifes_siblings_she_is_not/", "score": 1617, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wow.  This entire post is just disturbing.  Three adults can't seem to comprehend that their sister is NOT their mother is mind boggling.  They all obviously need some serious therapy and your wife needs some distance.  Kudos for having her back!", "NTA, you articulated something she\u2019d been wanting to say for a long time in a way the siblings could understand Good job \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb they don\u2019t like it but the truth is your wife gave up parts of her childhood to take care of them, nobody got the childhood they deserved. Hopefully someday they\u2019ll understand everyone lost in this situation and how lucky they were to have her around when they did. Wish you guys the best", "NTA and I applaud you for defending your wife and saying what needed to be said. Your wife definitely did the right thing, as you said she herself was a child and in no position to be responsible for her siblings. If she really wants to have a relationship with them I'd suggest family therapy and hopefully her siblings will see things from a different perspective.", "NTA. This sounds like a messed up family dynamic that is clearly harmful for you wife. Her siblings need to understand and come to terms with the fact that she was just as neglected as they were and missing a parent entirely. They at least had her care for part of their childhood. She didn't even have that much. I don't blame you for wanting to protect her. Don't be afraid to keep it up. She's never had someone in her corner before and am sure she is grateful for your help regardless how they treat her. They need to get help and your wife deserves happiness. She is a real mother now and am sure she would prefer to put her messed up childhood behind her so she can focus on her new family. Hopefully at some point she can work with her siblings to repair their twisted relationship.", "NTA, you are a top tier husband for doung that for her. I feel for her siblings because that can't have been easy to grow up in that situation, but at the same time your wife went through the same crap but was raising 3 kids while still a child herself. Considering that she probably has very confused feelings about raising her siblings to a point and having to give them up so she could live her life I imagine it would have been near impossible for her to say what you did, even though it was desperately needed. \n\nFr you did a great thing for her in setting them straight. Hopefully her siblings will calm down and they can build a real relationship with her, instead of making her some fantasy mother figure.", "NTA\n\nYour wife asked for your help and you helped her.", "NTA  because it seems your wife was very relieved by your words and the boundary you tried to set. This is a crappy situation all around, but your wife\u2019s siblings are definitely old enough to know she is not their mom and that she does not owe them a specific childhood especially as she was a child herself. On top of that, it seems your wife herself has tried to set boundaries and make clear that she is a mother to only one set of children and her siblings refuse to listen. It may be time to go no contact again honestly. Also, I know everyone suggests therapy for *everything* but this is a situation where that would potentially help. For everyone. Wife, siblings etc to work through what they went through, but also to set healthy boundaries. Keep supporting your wife, but make sure it\u2019s support she wants/needs and in the form she wants/needs.", "NTA! NTA NTA NTA!!\nOMFG Gold star of spousal support. All you did was tell them the truth and it was truth that your wife had asked for support in. They need therapy to sort through their own stuff, for sure, because they DID experience trauma but so did your wife. Their trauma is not more important than hers nor are their healing or needs.", "NTA\n\nIf it\u2019s affordable, group therapy for your wife and her siblings would be ideal. It\u2019s clear they love each other very much but don\u2019t know how to appropriately form an adult relationship.", "NTA- it sounds like a very screwed up childhood has led to some issues with the sibs and as others are saying, family therapy is probably warranted.  You stood up for your wife- good on you!!", "NTA. It sounds like you are going to have to set hard boundaries and go no contact. While the whole situation is shitty, your wife deserves her own life. Her siblings need to figure out their own lives.", "NTA. The siblings' behavior is very unsettling. Hopefully they can get the mental health help they need, but until then you guys need to keep them out of your lives. Keeping being the \"bad guy\" here for your wife's sake.", "Nta, like this reminds me of a aita story i read where a sister raised her 3 siblings and her 1 sister got reaally jealous over the sister kids.\n\nYour wife was not a mother, she was a kid trying to be a parent, she wasnt gonna do the best job. But she did what she could when she could. Now that life is better. She knows how to be a parent to her child. Any jealousy is imo her siblings need therapy, they didn't have a parent and since sister was the closest thing, they guilt her.\n\nAny jealousy they feel should be directed at a therapist.", "NTA. Your wife is lucky to have a spouse that supports and cares for her. Good for you for standing up for her! Please keep reinforcing this to her siblings!! Their childhood was a crappy deal all around but your wife shouldn't be made to pay for it.", ">But her siblings gave her a hard time afterward.\n\nGuess your job's not over, then?\n\nI think you avoided any major mistakes. Your comments avoided any kind of personal attack. NTA.", "NTA. It's time to discuss going permanently NC with them. They hold a lot of envy, insecurity and abandonment issues and they're channeling all of that at your wife instead if at their own actual parents. They will only bring anxiety, heart ache and toxicity to your lives.\n\nThey need therapy, but it's on them to find it, not on anyone else.", "NTA good for you for standing up for your wife. And it sounds like your wife is doing a great job of breaking the cycle of parental neglect. \n\nIt's awful that her siblings didn't get the kind of parenting they deserved from their actual parents but your wife is still not their mother. She IS the mother of your actual children and she is clearly mothering them as she should. It sucks that her siblings are jealous of that but if they're going to continue to act like this they should probably not be welcome in your lives until they can grow up or work through this in therapy.", "NTA - Go back to no contact. A terrible situation they all grew up in, but they need to realize she is not their parent and never will be.", "NTA. Do they critique their *actual* parents this harshly?", "NTA, you stood up for your wife with her blessing.  It sounds like they all need therapy to help them work through their childhood and see your sister as their sibling not mom.   \n\nKudos to her for realizing she nerd to do something for her future, and persevering!", "NTA\n\nI would suggest going NC with subs again, or at least c keeping them our of your children lives until boundaries are established, and they can accept what your wife endured.  \n\nIf contact is reestablished, I would suggest neutral meetings spots, lots of talk, and  perhaps therapy.", "NTA. I applaud your support. It\u2019s sad to say, but even if they had all, your wife included, been placed in the foster care system earlier they still would\u2019ve been separated. I\u2019m not certain if the standard applies in all states, but in mine, a parentified child is almost always separated from younger siblings. Ideally they would be placed in a home as the youngest or only child. It allows them time to learn to be a child again and rely on safe adults for support and guidance. It\u2019s also supposed to teach the younger siblings to look for support from actual adults. It clearly didn\u2019t work out that way for the siblings, which is a shame. A good foster parent would\u2019ve advocated immediately for therapy. It seems the system failed every single one of them.", "NTA. You stood up for your wife in what I can imagine is a very difficult time for her.", "NTA the needs therapy and if they don't grt it maybe they don't need to be in her life.\n\nThe trauma isn't their fault but it's absolutely their responsibility to heal and not hurt others", "NAH. \n\nYou're right, they need to understand that your wife was parentified and that she has always viewed them as siblings -- not her childrent. But that doesn't take away from the fact that to them, she was their mom and the person who took care of them. \n\nWhat needs to happen here really is some family therapy. \n\nIts clear that their home life wasn't safe and they need to work on building a relationship with your wife that is healthy and beneficial to all parties involved.", "nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My mother was put in a similar situation with her younger sister. My aunt was evil to me out of jealousy that my mother married, moved away and started her own family. I have NC with any of them now.", "NAH\n\nI feel for your wife, I also feel for the immense trauma that her younger siblings experienced.   I don't see this resolving or improving without therapy.  That may need to be a boundary that your wife wants to set if they want to keep coming around", "NTA-my youngest sibling used to accidentally call me mom. \n We talked when I ran away to claim my own life. They understood, and supported me.  \n\nThat said now a days they give me awesome mother's day presents.", "NTA yeah they have a screwed up life view and it's not your wife's fault she was covering for others. but the fact she looked relieved tells you everything you need to know. you did good.", "Honestly I would\u2019ve been much more harsh, but the tact you showed makes you NTA.", "They are not open to the idea of any kind of therapy.", "Yes, she told me she never had anyone in her corner before. She never had any adult figure she could speak to as a kid. She was hated by teachers for performing so poorly in school. She had no extended family. Her parents were simply not around. She was so lonely and even when she had her siblings, she didn't have them for her, they had her raising them.", "It has been incredibly difficult for her. She does love them, but she also struggles with how she loves them, because she has quietly admitted just to me that the two years without them was the easiest two years of her life and was the only time she didn't feel sucked dry. But she knows she is all they have known as a caretaker and that their childhood likely led to an inability to see anyone else as a parent since their parents were simply never there. She wishes someone had stepped in and removed them all when she was still young. But she never said that to them out of fear.", "They are not open to any kind of therapy. But yes, the childhood screwed with their perception of everything, paired with the fact she is the only one who \"knew\" their parents in any kind of way. They would only remember my wife.", "Yes, I do think we are headed there. But it needs to be my wife's decision and I will support her until she can make it.", "They are unfortunately not open to any kind of therapy or help with mental health.", "They don't know their actual parents and that might be part of the problem. But is still unfair to my wife.", "They were bounced around a lot in foster care. I know my wife hates that for them. But she also knew she couldn't have a future herself if she kept raising them.", "That's probably because they know a therapist will politely agree that their behaviour isn't right. From my own experience, blood does not equal family so please tell your wife not to feel guilty if she wants to just get on with her life for the sake of her peace. I hope she is ok", "Then it's time to go NC. They are being so ungrateful to the woman who raised them when she was a child herself. She wasn't going to be perfect, but she did what she could, and they should be happy that she is now in a place where she feels happy and secure. The fact that they are jealous of a literal CHILD for \"stealing the spotlight\" is ridiculous. They have issues, and if they aren't interested in improving or fixing them, there is no room for a healthy relationship.", "That\u2019s incredibly sad for your wife, I\u2019m happy she has her own little family now and that you seem to stick up for her. She\u2019s been through enough. THAT BEING SAID, I think your wife may need to be the one to tell them how it truly is, that she struggled alone caring for them, that she had to give up entirely too much and they\u2019re being extremely unfair to her. She needs to make it extremely clear to them that she may have been their caregiver for years, but she is not, nor was she ever their mother and they need to stop this. And if that doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s time to go no contact. This isn\u2019t healthy for them, but honestly way more importantly it\u2019s not healthy for your wife. She had the short end of the stick for years, and this is only more torment for her. They should know better by now.", "Then the only answer is no contact. Your wife and her siblings were dealt a really bad hand but she can't save people who won't do their part to make things better.", "Do they see her as their mother, or do they actually think she is? They do know that your wife didn't give birth to them right? This comment and their comment that you have no idea what they are talking about has me thinking they might legit think she is their mom.", "I don't know that they are thinking like that. If anything, they might have a negative association with any kind of therapy, like many people do. I have told my wife that. She's not able to fully implement or act on how she feels yet but I hope, for her own sake, she does consider it at least.", "They do know she didn't give birth to them. But I think their minds have twisted things into seeing it as she adopted them and is their mother in that sense.", "Bro what in the Gallagher same hell is this girls life. I would get them acting like that if they were young teens but they are in their 20s they need to grow up she has a hard life too and they need to let her try and be a mom to her child and not a mom to her siblings", "Nta. They need therapy.", "NTA obviously. Your wife has amazing strength! The wisest thing for her would be to block them on her phone and take a long break from them, and seek a good psychotherapist (perhaps she already has one).", "The fact that they\u2019re seriously weaponizing her role as \u201cmom\u201d and getting upset about her actual children is insane. These grown adults need therapy stat.", "NTA. If your wife is okay with it, be the go-between for her and her siblings. They need to understand that she is their sister and respect that she is a good mother, but not their mother. You will need to be the one to enforce boundaries because they aren't listening to your wife. You're doing a great job protecting her. Keep it up!!", "NTA that grown adults keep trying to make a woman 9 years older their mother is mind boggling. She would have been 9 when the eldest was born! That's not a mother! It's amazing they refuse to apply any critical thinking at all.", "NTA. If they were still kids today, I would have said they weren\u2019t AH either but given their age and the fact that your wife had to go no contact at one point, it seems they\u2019ve crossed a LOT of boundaries.\n\nYour wife\u2019s siblings need a lot of therapy. They were around 6, 7, and 9 when they went into foster care. Based on what you have said, by that point she had already been raising them for years even though she was just a teen. The younger 2 were so young when she was their caretaker that they probably didn\u2019t remember their parents ever being involved. The same may be true for the 24-year old too.\n\nHowever, at this point they are old enough to start reflecting on their childhoods and to realize that she is not their mother. She is not their bio mom, she was not old enough to be a foster parent. She was pressured into \u201cparenting\u201d her siblings while she was still a child.

Prison?", "Then I'm sorry to say that I don't think they're interested in a relationship with *her.* Who she is as an individual adult is of no interest to them.

Keep encouraging her and supporting her. Wishing you both all the best!", "It is a darn shame they can't be grateful for what she did do for them, instead of just mad because it isn't more.  They are ALL older now than she was when she had to take that responsibility.  Maybe a therapist can help you (or her) phrase setting boundaries in a healthy way that expresses this.", "Has your wife (or have you) ever pointed out to them how young she was? \n\nI know that sounds incredibly obvious \u2014 but they may not have done the math or, at least, they may not have really thought about what it means.\n\nThey're now older than she was when she dropped out of school to care for them \u2014 do they remember what it was like to be 16?\n\nThey probably feel kind of like the three of them were kids lost at sea, and she was the grown-up who came along with a rescue boat to save them. When really, they were all kids lost at sea, and she was just the biggest kid, who did her best to keep them alive until she could flag down the Coast Guard.", "Therapy only works for people who understand that they have a problem and want to find ways to improve. There needs to be a goal they want to work towards. It doesn\u2019t work if you drag them to therapy and tell them they have a problem. Sadly the siblings fall into the latter category.", "Your wife sounds like she's been doing very well recovering from her abusive childhood, a few sessions on her own just for a touchbase probably would be helpful.\n\nAs for her siblings, therapy won't do anything for them until they're ready to work through their own issues. For your wife's health, it may be best to put them in a time out for awhile until they learn to respect her boundaries.", "I suggest your wife go to therapy herself so she can learn how to manage her own response to their manipulation.
