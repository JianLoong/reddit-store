We\u2019re so close I even refer to him as \u201cUncle Jimmy\u201d. Jimmy has some really serious health issues, severe diabetes, and heart issues. Diabetes causes his legs and feet to swell and it\u2019s so bad he has a really difficult time walking or moving around in general. When I graduated high school I moved out of state and lost contact with him. We hadn\u2019t spoken for around 8 or 9 months as his health was deteriorating and despite reaching out his wife always answered and said it wasn\u2019t a good time.\n\nWhen visited my dad over the holidays I figured I\u2019d drop by Jimmy\u2019s place and pay him a visit. I called him several times over the course of my trip but never got an answer. On the second to last day, I decided just to drive over there. There wasn\u2019t a car in the driveway, but something just compelled me to knock on the door. I knocked and stood there for a few minutes. I heard mumbling and groaning, and since no one was answering I grabbed the spare key from its hiding place and unlocked the door.\n\nI found my Uncle Jimmy laying in the bathroom, covered in his own urine and crying. I immediately called an ambulance and tried to figure out what happened, and where his wife was. Apparently, he had fallen, and his wife told him he was \u201ctoo fat\u201d to pick up so she just took their young daughter (8 years old) and went shopping. After the ambulance came, I called my dad to tell him what was going on and he told me that he knew about Jimmy\u2019s wife but told me not to intervene anymore because Jimmy had to be the one to stand up for himself. My dad told me since I had left things had gotten really bad. She was only cooking him high-carb/sugar meals, then refusing to give him his insulin, or only giving him a small dose that had little to no effect. She would leave him sitting in his chair and wouldn\u2019t help him to the bathroom or to bed at night. He\u2019s on CPAP at night and she would turn it off because it bothered her.\n\nThis was far beyond his wife leaving him on the ground after he had fallen. I lost it on my dad and told him I was calling the cops, and I couldn\u2019t believe he hadn\u2019t. I called and they took my statement and they tried to take my Uncle Jimmy\u2019s at the hospital, but I honestly think he was too afraid to make one. My dad refused to make one. Jimmy\u2019s wife is out on bail now, but my dad is still mad at me. Saying I\u2019m an ahole for blowing up Jimmy\u2019s life and Jimmy\u2019s daughter's life, and if Jimmy really was worried he shouldn\u2019t have been a pussy and just called the cops himself. I think I did the right thing. It was insane what she was doing to him, and I can\u2019t understand why my dad is so upset with me.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA for calling the cops?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT to UPDATE for those who are curious\n\nMy Uncle Jimmy is getting the help he needs. He's still in the hospital and has a long way to go, but the nurses told me when they get his health stable enough he has a bed waiting at a facility for people that is used to taking on cases of severe diabetes. His wife is out on bail, a family friend took their daughter, and the wife is to have no contact with her daughter or Jimmy until the case is settled in court.

Watch the episode of Rick and Morty where Morty saves a telepathic fart and it's basically what happens when Murphy's Law hits while \"doing the right thing\"\n\nNow that my \"mind your business\" speech is over. I reiterate that you did the right thing on the grounds that your actions saved his life (or insensitive as it sounds, prolonged it). Sounds to me like Uncle Jimmy's in an abusive relationship and I know such things are often difficult to leave. But no amount of understanding really eliminates the frustration of watching a loved one in such a relationship. Seeing the inner conflict, yet?\n\nYou're definitely not the asshole. If there's an asshole, it's the wife. An argument could be made for Uncle Jimmy too for having to be hospitalized and still refusing to talk about what's happening, but most honorary uncles I know of are usually pretty good guys so that feels harsh. Pops I can't really call an asshole on the grounds of his \"mind ya business\" AND the fact that he's known Jimmy FAR longer than you. Pops likely knows what Jimmy needs more than most so if he says let Jimmy figure his own shit out, then let Jimmy figure his own shit out.", "Why do I think dad is having an affair with Jimmy's wife?", "Totally agree with what you just said here.

At all. \n\nShe actually SAW WITH HER OWN EYES how badly Uncle Jimmy was being mistreated and neglected. She was the only one who actually stood up for this man and his tragic physical and household condition. If (Heaven forbid \ud83d\ude13) anything happens to Uncle Jimmy, it will now be looked into and investigated as someone in an official capacity has been officially notified of his health and living conditions and just just brushed to the side. Because OP did this, this serves as receipts. And as I am always saying RECEIPTS ARE LIFE AND CAN HELP SAVE YOURS. Or in this case, help save Uncle Jimmy's life. And OP also needs to report this to APS as well. Let APS know this was reported to the local police as well. Uncle Jimmy needs someone to advocate for him and his needs, health and life.

You did the right thing, OP.", "I will say that your fathers anger prob comes from witnessing the abuse, hearing about the abuse, offering solutions to make sure your uncle and child is safe and being denied constantly.(It takes a toll to constantly witness a loved ones abuse and not being able to help so sometimes families respond with anger not at the person but the situation). Unless your uncle expressed that he was ready to leave his wife YOU DID NOT HELP THE SITUATION YOU MADE IT SO MUCH WORSE AND THE ABUSE IS GOING TO BE AMPLIFIED BC YOU CALLED THE COPS. Accepting abuse is like being an addict there is no way you can leave that situation unless you 100% want to there is no amount of persuasion that will get you the results you want. If this situation arises with anyone else the best thing is to get them comfortable, make them feel safe and ask questions to see where their mind is at bc they\u2019ll normally tell you if they\u2019re ready to leave and if they aren\u2019t you calling the cops only pushes the abused partner to the abuser and the blame will fall on you. I\u2019m sure your dad feels worse than you since he\u2019s been experiencing this a lot longer than you which is why he\u2019s so angry. If you really want to help there are ppl who specialize in abuse and can help the families make a safe plan to get their loved ones out or how to deal with loved ones that refuse to leave.", "NTA. It's disturbing how often people just like...skate right on by when abuse is happening. And make no mistake this was INCREDIBLE abuse, like to a ghastly degree. She's forcing a diabetic man to eat high carb meals that harm his health, refusing to give him insulin that he needs, and yanking the plug on his CPAP machine he needs at night? And callously left him on the floor where he couldn't get up? Sounds like she wants him dead, and isn't being too subtle about it.

He was at the stage of being ready to go outside again when he had his heart attack in bed - he was in his 80s and had had a triple bypass 11 yrs previously. The medics had said that it would give him 10 yrs.  \n\n\nI still agonise over whether I could have done more. DH had a bad night the night before he died and we were both sleep deprived. I spent over a year worrying that I'd somehow mucked up his meds or that I should have tried harder with CPR. In the end, our GP sat me down and reassured me.   \n\n\nDH had been taken off some of his heart meds after his AKI, but no replacement meds had been possible - they'd been contraindicated after his kidneys failed. Before he was allowed home, his kidneys had recovered somewhat, to 'normal' for someone of his age, I was told.  He'd also been eating much less, so his insulin dose had been halved. I took his glucose readings every day and emailed them to our doctor weekly.  \n\n\nI've no doubt that the wife in this case is finding life difficult, but there's no excuse for her behaviour - you don't just leave someone lying. When my husband had falls, if he couldn't get up with my help, I'd call the local fall team or an ambulance. God help me, one time he fell against the living room door, wedging it shut. I'm a fat old woman and I climbed through the serving hatch from the kitchen to get to him. I have no idea how I managed it.  I moved him away from the door enough to let the paramedics get through to him. You don't just leave your man lying.   \n\n\nIt sounds to me as though Uncle Jimmy would be much better off in a care facility. There's a remote possibility that the wife has had some kind of a mental breakdown, but it does sound like malice to me. Whatever the reason, the poor man needs to be taken out of that situation while he still has the chance to have some quality of life.  \n\n\nJust to add - in my country there's an automatic enquiry when someone dies at home. Even if they're frequently seen by medics, it's not automatically deemed that they're 'under the care of a doctor'. If anything happens to Uncle Jimmy, the wife may be in for a shock.", "OP see this!
