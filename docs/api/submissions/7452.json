{"id": 7452, "submission_id": "10d4srt", "title": "AITA for Calling the Cops on My Dad\u2019s Friend's Wife?", "selftext": "Sorry in advance for the long post.\n\nBackstory: My dad has this friend let's call him Jimmy he\u2019s been my dad\u2019s friend since before I was even born. We\u2019re so close I even refer to him as \u201cUncle Jimmy\u201d. Jimmy has some really serious health issues, severe diabetes, and heart issues. Diabetes causes his legs and feet to swell and it\u2019s so bad he has a really difficult time walking or moving around in general. When I graduated high school I moved out of state and lost contact with him. We hadn\u2019t spoken for around 8 or 9 months as his health was deteriorating and despite reaching out his wife always answered and said it wasn\u2019t a good time. \n\nWhen visited my dad over the holidays I figured I\u2019d drop by Jimmy\u2019s place and pay him a visit. I called him several times over the course of my trip but never got an answer. On the second to last day, I decided just to drive over there. There wasn\u2019t a car in the driveway, but something just compelled me to knock on the door. I knocked and stood there for a few minutes. I heard mumbling and groaning, and since no one was answering I grabbed the spare key from its hiding place and unlocked the door.\n\nI found my Uncle Jimmy laying in the bathroom, covered in his own urine and crying. I immediately called an ambulance and tried to figure out what happened, and where his wife was. Apparently, he had fallen, and his wife told him he was \u201ctoo fat\u201d to pick up so she just took their young daughter (8 years old) and went shopping. After the ambulance came, I called my dad to tell him what was going on and he told me that he knew about Jimmy\u2019s wife but told me not to intervene anymore because Jimmy had to be the one to stand up for himself. My dad told me since I had left things had gotten really bad. She was only cooking him high-carb/sugar meals, then refusing to give him his insulin, or only giving him a small dose that had little to no effect. She would leave him sitting in his chair and wouldn\u2019t help him to the bathroom or to bed at night. He\u2019s on CPAP at night and she would turn it off because it bothered her.\n\nThis was far beyond his wife leaving him on the ground after he had fallen. I lost it on my dad and told him I was calling the cops, and I couldn\u2019t believe he hadn\u2019t. I called and they took my statement and they tried to take my Uncle Jimmy\u2019s at the hospital, but I honestly think he was too afraid to make one. My dad refused to make one. Jimmy\u2019s wife is out on bail now, but my dad is still mad at me. Saying I\u2019m an ahole for blowing up Jimmy\u2019s life and Jimmy\u2019s daughter's life, and if Jimmy really was worried he shouldn\u2019t have been a pussy and just called the cops himself. I think I did the right thing. It was insane what she was doing to him, and I can\u2019t understand why my dad is so upset with me. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for calling the cops?", "created_utc": 1673842706, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10d4srt/aita_for_calling_the_cops_on_my_dads_friends_wife/", "score": 78, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sadly, it does not mean that you have saved Jimmy from this situation, but you signaled to him that someone cares and thinks he deserves better and that means a lot.", "NTA\nNTA\nNTA \nNTA\n\nEVERYONE else in this story is TAH apart from you and Jimmy. She is an abuser and is trying to kill him. I would bet my life he has life insurance and she'd be the beneficiary if he died. \n\nJimmy's health seems like it is so bad that he needa peoper care, and she's obviously not doing that. It is so hard for someone with a health issue to leave someone when they need help, even if they are being abusesd.\n\nDon't let this go. You did the right thing.", "NTA\n\nYour Uncle Jimmy is being abused by his wife and your father's being a complete asshole.", "NTA she's an abuser. Also if Jimmy has severe, untreated diabetes, how is he supposed to stand up for himself? He is most likely constantly fatigued and cotton brained. I bet even simple tasks are a huge struggle for him. Poor Jimmy, I hope there is someone who can help him.", "NTA  \n\nYour dad is seriously confusing.   Why on earth would he not want his friend to have proper care?   \n\nAnd that poor daughter seeing her father on the floor and then have to leave to go shopping.   What kind of lesson is that?  \n\nHis wife ought to be in jail for abuse.", "NTA.\n\nShe is physically neglecting and abusing him. It is often dangerous for the abuse victim to make the report on their own, so you did the right thing. \"Blowing up Jimmy's life\" seriously? Your dad just wants you to let Uncle Jimmy die painfully from medical abuse because it will be less scandal when he DIES than when his abusive wife goes to jail?", "NTA\n\nShe is clearly abusing Jimmy. You made the right decision calling the cops. Hopefully he gets the help he needs. Chronically high blood sugar can cause blindness, limb loss, and even death.", "NTA, maybe the only one to stand up for what's right.", "Adult protective services.", "NTA, and Wtf?? It sounds like his wife is literally trying to kill him!! Why does your dad think that a sick man who is being abused should just \"stand up for himself\"? On what, his swollen purple feet that he's probably going to lose to amputation? That woman is actively trying to kill her sick husband and it's demented that no one has tried to help him. I hope he's in the hospital long enough to access some resources so he can start to get better", "NTA YOU DID THE RIGHT THING!!!!!!!!! I cannot stress that enough, you did the right thing! \n\nYour dad's view is terrible and inaccurate. Abuse is abuse is abuse no matter your gender. Sometimes an advocate like you is needed to step in. These situations aren't black and white. Good job, OP.", "NTA. This is awful and you did what was needed.", "You've mentioned at least three life-threatening actions in this post. \n\nI mean this sincerely:  \nIt sounds like this man's wife is genuinely attempting to kill him.", "NTA \n\nWtf is wrong with your father? Jimmy is going to die, he is being slowly murdered. That\u2019s beyond neglect into fully on sabotage. A marriage is caring for your partner when they are ill, She is trying to kill him, He needs someone like you on his side because he can\u2019t defend himself anymore. You say she\u2019s out on bail so that means she\u2019s back at the house? Now probably angered and taking it out on the man who she\u2019s been abusing this entire time? I shudder to think how this can turn out", "NTA you did the right thing.", "This was terrifying to read. NTA. Please keep us updated.", "NTA - thank god you intervened! Its the least you could do tbh - you can\u2019t leave him in that situation and do nothing.", "Omg that is horrible! \n\nEven if the cops don't/can't do anything, Adult Protective Services might. Could be worth a shot calling in a report. (I don't know if Jimmy is old enough for this to count as elder abuse but still)\n\nEta judgment. NTA", "NTA!! She\u2019s trying to kill Jimmy. \nJeebus\u2026 I hope he gets help.
