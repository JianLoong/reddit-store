IMO, the past year she has given absolutely no effort towards her life, and it has completely turned me off (not just sexually, but just from the relationship as a whole). \n\nShe's 25, has no job, lives at her parents house, doesn't go to school, doesn't drive (has a license, but is scared of the road). I also live at my parent's house, am 22, in college, and work part-time. \n\nI've been telling her for months now that she's needed go do something. Anything. Literally anything at this point. Go take driving lessons (I offered to pay), get a job, go back to school, start working out. I'm the one that drives 30 minutes back and fourth to pick her up when we hang out. Unless we're hanging out, odds are she sits in her room and doesn't leave the house for the entire day. She stopped going to therapy, too.\n\nI've been nudging her nicely for the past year, slowly getting more and more fed up. It's always \"I'm trying my best\" or \"I'm working on it.\" Never any action being taken. I offer to help from any aspect, I know it's going to take one step at a time but if she ever takes that first step, it's dropped within a week. She started working out, but gave up after 2 weeks. She LITERALLY had a job at a local store, but then called them and told them she couldn't do it anymore, gave them and me some BS excuse. There is always an excuse. \n\nClearly, I'm fed up with it. I've been trying for a whole year. And I've ALWAYS asked nicely, offered to do everything with her. Help her drive, go to the gym with her, help her find a job. Still nothing. Fast forward to last week, where she tells me that I'm not giving enough effort in the relationship and I need to treat her better in some ways. Very fair, I could be better in some aspects, but then I bring up the point that I've been asking you to do these things for months on end, that is genuinely a source of my lack of effort towards the relationship. That's when I said something like: \"How am I supposed to give effort towards us  when you aren't even functional at a basic level? Come on, I'm asking for the bare minimum here.\" \n\nIt sounds mean now that I think it back, but can you see where I'm coming from? I did not mean for it to be mean, but genuinely being honest, she is 25 and quite literally sits at home all day. Am I the asshole? \n\nTLDR; After months of pure laziness and neglect towards her own life, I told my girlfriend she \"is not functional at a basic level.\"", "created_utc": 1696411562, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16zijnr/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_she_is_not/", "score": 236, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The thing I did was focus on always making progress, no matter how much or how little, and always sticking with therapy/medication. \n\nYou're not an asshole for asking to see effort.

At least, not until she moves past this. In that case, it is kinder to leave.\n\nIf you truly care about her and want to help her ride this out, you may need help engaging your empathy. There\u2019s a comic blog called Hyperbole and a Half. \u201cDepression Part 2\u201d is one she posted about struggling with depression. It\u2019s hilarious and super insightful.

I get it's hard to watch her flounder, but if it's been going on for at least a year, with gentle and not so gentle nudges from you - it's time to back off and let her decide to resume counseling, or not.

I have similar issues and I need someone to take care of me, since I'm not able to even eat properly. I'm medicated, treated, but it's still really hard with me. My ex is workaholic and since I'm not able to hold on a job, we weren't compatible. I have ADHD and BPD and I can't cure it and even if meds help, it's not enough. Therapy helped tremendously, but it's not miraculous thing, that will change your whole personality. \n\nI need care and support from my surroundings and luckily I'm on paid psychiatric sick leave (with ex I couldn't, because meds are bad and so on...), so I'm no financial burden to anyone. But it's still hard for my boyfriend. I try to do everything myself, but I'm 29 and I had to learn it. With my diagnosis and severity of my issues, I need someone, who is ok with taking care of me. And I'm honest with it (after we hooked up for the first time with my current boyfriend, he drove me to therapy :D and next hookup I gave him my \"psycho folder\" to read how messed I am :D) and I told him many times, that if he's not ready for it, we can't date, because it could hurt him so bad...but we're together and I think that we are amazing. We are still learning and he needs to learn some things about my mental health issues and therapy I went through, but it's getting there and I feel, that with his support I can do anything in the future. And because of it, I took Italian classes and just do something small to be able to find a job, that is not shitty retail, where I'm burned out after a week working there.\n\nImagine it like this. When you see someone on a wheelchair, you see their struggles and you can imagine it. With mental health issues it's hard, because you don't see it. But both of those people needs to have some kind of support. For people on wheelchairs it means ramp to their house, for people with mental health issues it means support, understanding and sympathy. But that doesn't mean, that if you're not able to offer this kind of support, leave.\n\nI'm not saying, that you're bad person or something. I'm showing you how it looks like from the point of view of someone, who sees herself a bit in your girlfriend and show you, that it's not easy for people around me. You're ambitious and clearly you need someone, who will inspire you with their ambitions, with whom you can work on mutual goals and so on.  And it's perfectly fine! And maybe this person will have also some issues and you'll have to take care of them. But you'll do it from place of love, not place of resent.\n\nIf you leave her, maybe it will be that push, she needs in life.

If she has, for example, hypothyroidism - it is a physical issue, she will not look sick, but will not be able to go to gym and function in general. No matter how much you encourage her or shame her, it will not make her thyroid working again. The same goes for some mental illnesses.  Therapists often don't have enough knowledge to diagnose them, and she stopped going to the therapy anyway. \n\nYou are right, she is not functional, but based on what you wrote: scared of the road, not leaving her house at all, quitting therapy, \"I am doing my best\"... the cause is not laziness, and there is a health reason behind it, not BS excuses. \n\nIf you are done with her (and it is understandable) - at least tell her parents to literally drag her to doctor and write down all the symptoms.

Go take driving lessons (I offered to pay), get a job, go back to school, start working out. I'm the one that drives 30 minutes back and fourth to pick her up when we hang out. Unless we're hanging out, odds are she sits in her room and doesn't leave the house for the entire day. She stopped going to therapy, too.\n\nI've been nudging her nicely for the past year, slowly getting more and more fed up. It's always \"I'm trying my best\" or \"I'm working on it.\" Never any action being taken. I offer to help from any aspect, I know it's going to take one step at a time but if she ever takes that first step, it's dropped within a week. She started working out, but gave up after 2 weeks. She LITERALLY had a job at a local store, but then called them and told them she couldn't do it anymore, gave them and me some BS excuse. There is always an excuse. \n\nClearly, I'm fed up with it. I've been trying for a whole year. And I've ALWAYS asked nicely, offered to do everything with her. Help her drive, go to the gym with her, help her find a job. Still nothing. Fast forward to last week, where she tells me that I'm not giving enough effort in the relationship and I need to treat her better in some ways. Very fair, I could be better in some aspects, but then I bring up the point that I've been asking you to do these things for months on end, that is genuinely a source of my lack of effort towards the relationship. That's when I said something like: \"How am I supposed to give effort towards us  when you aren't even functional at a basic level? Come on, I'm asking for the bare minimum here.\" \n\nIt sounds mean now that I think it back, but can you see where I'm coming from? I did not mean for it to be mean, but genuinely being honest, she is 25 and quite literally sits at home all day. Am I the asshole? \n\nTLDR; After months of pure laziness and neglect towards her own life, I told my girlfriend she \"is not functional at a basic level.\"\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If it's feeling like a \"why can't you do this?\" rather than a \"I really think you can do this, even if it takes time\" she may already feel defeated.\n\nAsk her how you two can communicate better because what you're saying is coming from a place of love and concern for her wellbeing. You may have chosen the wrong words in the past but your aim isn't to make her feel worse.\n\nAlso her parents responses/attitudes will have a massive effect on her as she lives with them.", "She can want to commit to helping herself with her whole heart and still not be able to make a change. Thats a part of mental illness in and of itself. Youll likely have to help her through your entire relationship. If thats not something you want to do, thats more than okay. Ive been married since 21(32 now) and struggled w mental health my whole life. I go years doing great and then sometimes i have a year or 2 where im just basically not functional myself. I consistently do therapy but i still have my bad times. This is hard on my husband but something he finds worth it. Its hard being w someone mentally unwell. You gotta think to yourself what you really wanna sign yourself up for. No matter what you choose i hope it works out well for the both of you. Please just be mindful of how and what youre saying to people with mental health problems in the future. It can do a lot of unseen damage", "These few comments sums everything up really. Healthy relationships are about equality. It sounds like it's time to move on to a new chapter of your life OP.\n\nNTA and good luck with the future.", "[removed]", "He said she stopped going to therapy so the chances of her being on meds are probably nil.", "She quit going to therapy.", "She needs medication. If she can't force herself out of her room then she's not going to be able to go to therapy. Modern SSRIs and SNRIs are serious meds, but they can be very helpful.", "At a certain point you need to make an effort to not feel like crap though. Otherwise you\u2019ll just sit and wallow. Sounds like she\u2019s not interested in making an effort.", "And when dumping her, he can reiterate it as a reason. It's an excellent reason to dump somebody. She's doing nothing, telling him he needs to put more effort in, and that's really unattractive.\n\nShe's entitled to not do anything, and he's entitled to point out how doing so has considerably lessened his opinion of her.\n\nFrankly him splitting up with her because of that, rather than general incompatibility, might just be the kick she needs.", "Oh yeah, that is completely off the table right now. Speaking of basic house chores, that is correct, her room is a total mess at all times. It's bad enough to where she loses clothes and will find them in unpacked suitcases months later. \n\nI need to see some drastic improvements very quickly to stick this one out.", "Thanks for making me laugh tonight LOL", "It's just gonna make the both of you more unhappy and bitter unless by some miracle stuff starts changing. Maybe, just maybe, that'll help her out in the long run since it now sounds like she's also just become reliant on you.", "May even be the nudge that gets her out into the world. Agreed NTA but everything you\u2019ve said sounds like you\u2019re already done.", "You also genuinely don't sound like you have any positive feelings for her anymore. 'I've been dating this girl for 3 years' is crazy. I'm not saying you should treat her like your forever partner but where is the love in the way you talk about her?\n\nI completely agree with this comment and it's best that you let her go. You either didn't feel very strongly about her from the beginning or it's just withered completely due to the way you've come to view her.", "Yeah OP says no depression with his whole chest, and yet her behavior screams untreated social anxiety worsened by depression. This was me for two to three YEARS during my twenties. You have a right to be frustrated OP, and even end the relationship. But I really don\u2019t think she\u2019s not improving to just\u2026not improve or be lazy. If you have worsening social anxiety and depression, leaving THE HOUSE AT ALL can feel like a gargantuan task. Let alone getting a job or taking driving lessons. I would just make sure she has some kind of support system in place for when you leave.", "Not just that, but mental illness rears its head in the 20s.", "Well you say he neither desires or respects her and lots of people can read that like, he should or she's done anything possible to be capable of respect most people deserve in a relationship.", "I don't know her and I am not a doctor, but all this REALLY sounds like depression to me.", "Therapy and meds are more often than not separate.", "i do my therapy over video. this could be an option for her to look for.", "He will be wise to choose kinder words when breaking it off with her because it does sound like she is living with depression. \u201cWe\u2019re not on the same path anymore\u201d is an easy one and already includes what they\u2019ve discussed before.", "Your girlfriend is clearly depressed. Everything you're describing is the actions of someone who is going through mental health issues. She absolutely needs therapy and probably some medication. I wouldn't move in with or want to date someone who wasn't taking care of themselves\n\nEdit: I kind of feel like I didn't finish my thought which is that if it's a three year relationship and you feel like you want to keep trying if she gets medical/mental help I understand and if you feel like it's too much I also understand. I just feel bad bc she's obviously sick and can't make the best decisions, which is that she needs therapy/help.", "Don\u2019t move in with her! You said your career is in a great place for your age. Break up and focus on your career. There is a chance that she will realize she needs to change when she actually loses you. Right now you are enabling her.", "I feel like op knows he\u2019s outgrown the relationship but isn\u2019t content to just end things and move on. The fact that he\u2019s happy to mention every flaw his gf has whilst constantly comparing them to his own successes and only briefly mentions the fact that she\u2019s feeling unhappy about the relationship/is very vague about the things he could do better whilst placing most of the blame for that on her and the fact that she\u2019s not tried \u201chard enough\u201d for him makes me believe that a good portion of his frustration lays within the fact that the gf isn\u2019t transforming from depressed to living her best life and working to improve the world itself overnight the way he thinks she should. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to say op is the AH, but he\u2019s not being mindful of the fact that his gf is struggling mentally and probably isn\u2019t actually get the correct level of help she needs in order to move past this despite the fact that he believes she\u2019s just being \u201clazy\u201d. The fact that he\u2019s going \u201csure, I could be better. But she-\u201c rather than properly acknowledging he\u2019s not exactly been the supportive boyfriend he\u2019s tried to paint himself as isn\u2019t really putting him in the good books either in my opinion.\n\nEither way I\u2019m not exactly sure if I\u2019m going to put a verdict yet or not. I feel like there\u2019s a lot more to this story than op is letting on and am curious to see if it\u2019ll come to light or not.", "And the less you leave the house, the harder it is to do it each time because the anxiety grows and grows. That's how you end up being a shut in. I've been there, multiple times, and it's really hard to dig yourself out from. One good thing that came from COVID is that Telehealth and in-home therapy have become so much more common. You can get help without having to function enough to get there, which helps you get better so you *can* start to function again..", "Yea I'm currently pretty much the way OP describes his girlfriend and it's definitely anxiety AND depression", "She does not want to get better so this will not happen.", "Why?", "The fact she apparently stopped therapy is what gets me feeling bonkers! I went through full on hospitalized psychosis years ago and through extremely hard work and therapy I have a degree and while I'm struggling to find work, I keep a clean apartment and I actually do stuff\n\nI make money on the side with my art, I write, I walk every day, I mostly cook at home, and I'm good with what little money I do have; I'm barely scraping by but you'll never see me with my phone or internet shut off", "He's 22 and hardworking. He doesn't need to be signing up to be with someone who's so severely depressed they're not functioning on a basic level. That seems like a huge anchor. \n\nNTA, OP", "For me it's autism and burnout. Driving can be really overwhelming too. Plenty of never diagnosed folks out there too, symptoms of burnout can look a lot like depression too.", "Gonna guess that they're afraid of her harming herself, but I think that's really unfair to OP. I have depression and have been suicidal and still feel frustrated with the kdea that people with depression need to be treated with extreme caution at all times lest they off themselves. Depressed people can still need and deserve reality checks...imo being indirect here serves absolutely nobody.", "Why not? Why choose to be mean when it's not necessary?", "this will have nothing to do with the op, but i wanted to tell you that i\u2019m really proud of you, even though we\u2019re strangers! this is really amazing to read, and i hope things keep looking up for you :)", "Depression lies.  It tells you to stop everything.  It\u2019s very hard to get out of because you won\u2019t want help.   None of this is his problem or fault.  Run.", "Yep. I didn\u2019t leave the house for two weeks and didn\u2019t even notice", "THIS. For me it was autism, burnout, AND depression & ptsd all at once. the chronic pain didn't help either. I stopped doing all my classwork, I did the absolute bare minimum (maybe even less) at work, I stopped talking to my friends and only left the house when I absolutely had to. Dropping out was the best decision I ever made because I probably would have killed myself as the semesters went on. I also went to a few therapy sessions, and (this isn't relevant here but) finally starting my transition also helped with my depression. I'm still digging myself out of the burnout hole, but I'm a LOT better than I was at this time 2 years ago"]}
