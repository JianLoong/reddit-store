I proceed to answer the phone. \"\\[Name of place I work at and city\\], how can I help you?\" A high pitch voice talks on the other side of the phone. \"Hi, I want to order everything on your menu\". At this point, I knew I was being prank called. The girl sounded like if she was around 7 or 9 years old. I just hang up the phone. She calls again and my co-worker answers the phone. She says the same thing and my co-worker tells the little girl that she has to come in and pay for the food first before we can start working on the order. My co-worker then hangs up. \n\nAfter the 7th time of being prank called by the girl, I decided to cook up a plan. I take note of the girl's phone number and called her using a private number. The girl answers the phone. \"Hello?\" said the little girl. \"Good evening, this is the 911 Dispatcher and we have received multiple complaints of you prank call-\" \\*click\\*. The Girl hung up the phone, so naturally, I proceeded to call again after she hung up. \"Hello?\". An Older woman is now talking on the phone and it was the mother of the little girl. My plan has just found heaven. \"Good evening ma'am, how are you doing?\" The mother then proceeds to tell me she's doing good and the reason for my call. \"Oh, sorry about that, I'm a 911 Dispatcher and we've received multiple complaints about your daughter prank calling \\[Name of my job\\] and telling a cashier there to shut up\". The mom proceeds to apologize to me, but the little girl tries to tell her mother that I was lying. The mother tells the little girl to shut up and proceeds to talk to me again. \"I'm so sorry for that, I promise that it'll never happen again\". She then hangs up and we didn't get prank called for the rest of the day.\n\nI know impersonating a First Responder is a bad thing, but I had to do it to teach the little girl a very valuable lesson.

My friends and I used to call 1-800 sex lunes, tape record the intro message, then call random 1-800 numbers and play them back to their answering machines. \n\nOne day we got a call back. We had been playing back the intro from 1-800-MAN-BEEF that day. An angry man shouted, \"I called the cops you little shits!!\" We ran in a panic to my friends house around the corner, because we figured they could never find us there.", "NTA - There are websites what will crank call back to numbers that prank call, from porn sites to 911 and record it for you to listen to. Did this a couple times for prank caller kids with funny results lol", "YTA for lying to the mom. At that point the truth would have sufficed. Might have gotten that kid in more trouble than they deserved. Doing it to the kid, fine.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You don't know what happens after you hang up that phone. Telling the mother that you are a 911 Operator escalates the issue. Who knows what that home situation is like?\n\nShe's 9 years old....grow up and stop feeling the need to payback someone half your age.", "NTA - She learned the hard way that prank calls go both ways. I think she\u2019d probably learned her lesson after the first call though, so I\u2019d have probably left it there personally.", "Did she actually tell your coworker to shut up, or did you make that up for flair?", "Good evening, this is the 911 dispatcher and we have received a complaint about you impersonating a first responder.", "INFO: Why couldn't you just call as from the Wing Place to get to her mother and state the same truth. Why did you have to pretend to be 911? \n\nIf you thought she wouldn't take it seriously enough, you could have rattled off some of your menu prices and said you wanted to confirm the girl's order...", "Sometimes you have to tell a white lie to save the day especially to those who never get it.", "ESH\n\n\nCall the number and tell the parents, yes.\n\n\n\nCalling, pretending to have authority, lying about what the child did?\n\n\nWhy inflate the tale instead of just telling the parent the truth - you lied to get a kid in more trouble, loser.", "I'm going to go with NTA. The mother was reasonable but honestly in this day and age she could just as well have screamed at you for daring to upset her little darling. You can't expect reasonable behaviour from adults any more.", "ESH. That girl shouldn\u2019t have been prank calling you multiple times. But you impersonated 911 which may be a felony, depending on your state. You also used it to bully a child, which is not okay.", "Good for you, now the little girl knows how it feels to be pranked.  Hope she learned her lesson.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re kind of a legend Tbh", "I MEAN MAYBE BUT THATS HILARIOUS TBH", "YTA  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I love you.", "YTA. Just tell the parent the truth. That way they can correct the problem.", "I'll go with NTA. Yes, impersonating a 911 dispatcher is bad,but this will be a teaching moment for the kid who no doubt got scared shitless and will also be in trouble at home. \n\nAnd she'll not know it was a prank, too.", "NTA. It was a dick move but a mostly justified one, though personally I would have stopped after the girl hung up. You\u2019d well and truly made your point, no need to rub it in any further.", "YTA. You lied that the girl said shut up. Do you know what kind of home she lives in? She might be grounded or punished for that? You could have said she\u2019s asking for everything on the menu, the truth. You didn\u2019t make the order and lose money. I hope your boss finds out and apologises properly . Perhaps someone who knew your prank would impersonate an officer and come knocking on your door saying that you harassed the mother on the phone? Is that what you want ?", "NTA", "NTA well that worked.", "They deserved trouble, it's not like they will get much more then a talk from the mom", "I was 7 years old when I prank called someone. I also learned the hard way having the police at my parent's door. Trust me, sometimes it's best when learning things the hard way. Every action has consequences.", "Yes, she did tell my co-worker to shut up", "hello, this is the police, we've received a complaint against you for impersonating a 911 dispatcher.", "I didn't lie about what the child did.", "Respectable \ud83d\ude02", "Awhh, thank you", "I've thought of this for a while tbh", "Honestly, that last bit... I learned my lesson in the past.", "You got the wrong guy! I\u2019m being framed. You believe me, right?", "Hello, this is the FBI, we've received a complaint against you for impersonating the police, also known as the \"Po Po\"", "Oooh yeah, that's why the kid calling and telling staff to shut up is in the story....", "Are you saying that your parents used the threat of police and perhaps prison? That the way you learned your lesson in the past is by having some adult impersonate a figure of authority to scare you into good behaviour and submission? Because if that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying and you thought it was good enough for you , you can use it on other kids once you\u2019re an adult, on your own children perhaps to make them fall into line, then I hope a real police officer shows up to your door. That\u2019s very messed up, seek therapy.", "Hello, this is the global elite. We have a complaint about you impersonating the FBI pranking someone impersonating the Po-po attempting to prank someone impersonating a 911 dispatcher pranking a little girl.", "Well, you have the right to have your opinion, which I respect."]}
