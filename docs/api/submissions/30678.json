I am new to Reddit and created this account just to be able to get outside opinions, so I hope I do this correctly\n\nI am 40f and have a son 17m, he has just gotten his first girlfriend and both me and his dad were very thrilled by this! We asked him if she would like to come over for dinner so that we could meet her and get to know her. He asked her, told us that she would love to.\nThis was about two weeks ago and we set up a date (the dinner was Thursday night so just yesterday).\n\nI cooked what I always cook when we have guests over (if it is not a specific type of dinner). I just throw together a smaller ceasar salad as an appetizer and then serve a steak with potatoes that I have on the pan with butter, garlic and some bacon. \n\nSince I was cooking I just greeted her while my son, her and my husband was sat in the living room. When dinner was ready, she did not eat anything. My son threw me nasty looks but did not say anything, I asked her if she wanted something else but she just kind off awkwardly said that it was fine. When I bring out the main dish, she did not take anything this time either. I felt so bad that I did not make anything that she liked, I told her that I would love to throw together something for her but she turned my offer down and told me that it was just nice company and the food was not the main part, but she was sure it was good.\n\nIt went great, she left and immediately after my son blew up on me. She asked me why I would cook everything with animal products when I knew she was a strict vegan, I felt kind off bad and thought that I had just forgotten about it, I asked him when he told me that and said I was sorry. He told me he said that when we talked about inviting her for dinner, my husband just chimes in with \u201cNo son, you did not\u201d. My son is still insisting that he told me and that he made sure several times that I was still on track with that, but I have zero recollection of that.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I am just extremely forgetful and he is right, he is so insistent that he told me and I feel like maybe he did, I mean it is his girlfriend and he know I always cook with animal products, so why wouldn\u2019t he?\n\nSo am I the asshole for not cooking anything she could eat? Maybe I should have asked him what she liked to eat and asked if there was something she couldn\u2019t..", "created_utc": 1699580885, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17rt4em/aita_for_not_cooking_something_my_sons_girlfriend/", "score": 3494, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your son thought he told you when he first discussed the dinner. Your husband confirms that he didn't. So his recollection of other times telling you are suspect.  You would have been TA if you had deliberately cooked things you knew she couldn't eat. It would have been best to ask ahead of time if she had dietary preferences. But you did nothing deliberately wrong.  You offered to make her something else, that was the right thing to do. Apologize to her and invite her for a vegan meal. Maybe one that you can cook together so that you can spend some quality time together and she can teach you how to accommodate her needs. You've told your son that you didn't hear what he said about her being vegan. He needs to get over it and figure out ways he can be more involved in menu planning when so much is on the line.", "NTA \n\nspeaking from experience (of being 17 once haha) there is a very high likelyhood that your son forgot to mention this very cruicial fact ...but then genuinely thinks he did ... because well its a very cruicial piece of information. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nhopefully he will learn as it sounds more of his fault in this.", "NTA I have a hard time believing that you would totally miss the whole vegan thing. It\u2019s a really hard menu to put together, so you would have to think about it very carefully. No milk, no cheese, no honey, etc.", "NTA.. it\u2019s your sons gf he should have reminded you AND helped you cook for her. Maybe I\u2019m old fashioned.", "NTA, your son should have doubled checked with you before he came over or the morning. Your husband even said your son never told you. You are not at fault.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you intentionally cooked a meat based meal knowing shes a vegan. \nIf your husband says he didn\u2019t tell you, and you don\u2019t recall; More than likely your so. thought he told you and he\u2019s the one forgetting that he didn\u2019t. \nYou also offered to make her something when you realized something was off. You son really should\u2019ve followed up or asked what was on the menu prior.\nEither way. It\u2019s not a big deal and at least you know for next time.", "How can anyone judge this? The whole thing hinges on whether you actually did forget or whether your son is lying to you. No one here has access to the truth. The only hint is that your husband says your son didn't tell you during the particular conversation your son brings up that your husband apparently was present at; however, I have no idea if your son told you at any other time. It's weird he'd give you looks during dinner if he lied after the fact though.", "NTA... more than likely, he forgot to tell you, and he was embarrassed.  By your account, the girlfriend handled things quite well, and you should be proud that your son is with a kind partner.\n\nLike someone else suggested, I would reach out to her, apologize for the miscommunication, and invite her back over for a new vegan meal.", "NTA and as a vegan it happens all the time. your sons gf can guess exactly what happened (your son definitely, absolutely, without a doubt, forgot to tell you) so don't worry", "I mean i guess it depends if he really told you or not. Because hubs confirmed he didn't I would say NTA", "TBH if even your husband says he didn\u2019t say anything he probably did not say anything. I\u2019d look through messages to see if he said anything there. But NTA you did not know. And you even offered to make something else. Even under the circumstances where he said it and you forgot, you did try. When vegans get invited out places they get used to either not eating or bringing their own meals.", "NAH. It was miscommunication, somebody forgot/didn't hear. Next time she comes make her nice vegan fare and apologize for last time. She was very well-mannered about it, which is certainly a point in her favour!", "NAH. We have a rule in our house for the 'I told you/I imagined I told you/you forgot' stitch up. Instead of running ourselves in circles we accept that somewhere things got lost and we work to find a solution for next time. \n\nMaybe he told you, maybe he told you on a different context and it slipped your mind, maybe he didn't tell you at all. Ask him to drop his defences and ask if he wants to be right or to solve the problem and the latter is what you're interested in. Ask him if you can have a re-do and ask him to help you with the menu.", "Your son should\u2019ve helped you cook and found a recipe he could help make her!", "NTA. There was miscommunication and you offered to make her something else.", "NTA this sounds like an honest mistake! Maybe she is just shy but I find it strange that she wouldn\u2019t mention this and accept when you asked if she wanted something else to eat. \n\nI\u2019d invite her over for dinner again soon, apologize for the misunderstanding, and cook a meal that has options for her.", "NTA. I imagine that he forgot to tell you she was vegan and is now trying to back track. There is no way you AND your husband would forget such an important detail, especially since he is claiming he clarified it multiple times.", "NTA but there is something strange here. He insists that he told you not just once but multiple times, that \"he made sure several times that I was still on track with that,\" but you don't remember it at all. That's more than a simple miscommunication. Not to be too alarmist but you might want to consider mentioning possible memory loss at your next physical and getting checked out for early onset alzheimer's. Hopefully there's a more benign reason but better safe than sorry.", "You don't remember him saying anything, your husband sounds certain he didn't say anything, I'm betting he's embarrassed that he didn't say anything and is lashing out at you for it.\n\nWhat's more likely? He said it, and neither you nor your husband remembers despite having checked with you several times, or you and your husband both remember correctly that you were not told?", "NTA\n\nMy guess is that your son did not tell you she was vegan.  This is further confirmed by his insisting that he confirmed with you multiple times... He wouldn't have mentioned it while you were cooking the meat right in front of him?  And let's not forget your husband confirming.\n\nTeenagers do stupid things, and communication is hard for everyone.  It's important not to get too caught up in that.\n\nIf you're up to it, invite her back for dinner, and cook vegan, that should put things right.", "This seems to just be a case of simple miscommunication. As already stated, invite her over again and fix a meal she can eat. Let both her and your son know there was no ill will, again just a communication error. Hopefully you all can get a little chuckle out of it and enjoy a nice meal together. Also have to say, kudos to the young lady to not make a fuss and say the comment she did about how it\u2019s nice to spend the time together. Sounds like she already has a good head on her shoulders.", "NAH- it doesn't matter if it was you or your son who forgot. You were all accidentally inconsiderate. You should just try this again, but be careful, many dishes have secret animal products you wouldn't think of like the anchovies in Caesar salad dressing. If it helps, any 17 year old who can sit through an entire dinner without eating anything and still say it was just really great to meet everyone, is probably a very kind and forgiving young woman.", "NTA but your son sure is. He could have - and ***should have*** \\- been working with you on a menu plan that worked.", "I highly doubt a 17 year old actually told you and that you and your husband forgot. You did nothing wrong. It was just an unfortunate situation borne from miscommunication (or lack of). You're already a better mom than most for being an open and gracious host. NTA, but your son definitely is. Just sounds ungrateful and entitled.", "NAH. I probably would have clarified and confirmed her dietary restrictions (and you should always) and allergies before hand. Even if you did forget when he told you, it\u2019s not like you were being malicious and your son should understand that. Hopefully he will soon.\n\nYour son is a teenager and first girlfriends are scary which is the only reason I give him leeway. Next time he\u2019s upset about something that kid better check himself. When he\u2019s calmer maybe try to talk to him and tell him you\u2019re not trying to make excuses and you honestly don\u2019t remember. You shouldn\u2019t insist that he didn\u2019t tell you and your husband shouldn\u2019t either. Make him feel heard apologize and maybe even ask him if you can call her to apologize yourself because you want her to feel welcome to come back.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t want you to call her apologize in person next time you see her.\n\nAnd remember to always double check dietary requirements and preferences for guests! (Make a list and check it twice lol)", "NTA. It sounds like your son meant to tell you but forgot about it. Then you offered to cook her something she would eat and she declined. That isn't your fault.", "NTA always good to ask about food when inviting someone new over for dinner, but this wasn't your fault. Your son probably dropped the ball entirely, doesn't want to admit it to his new gf, so he's blaming you.", "NTA - here's an idea, why doesn't HE cook for HIS girlfriend", "The issue here is not what you cooked, but whether or not you were informed of her dietary requirements.  NTA if you were not informed that she was a vegan.  I would say, though, that in this day and age it is unusual to assume that someone will happily eat a steak without double checking first!   (Not a criticism, just an observation).  This is a recoverable situation - when everyone calms down, a simple apology to the GF that there was a miscommunication about meal requirements, and next time there'll be a vegan feast!  :)", "NTA", "NTA. Unless you have been forgetting a lot of stuff lately, it's highly unlikely you would have forgotten something as important as the first dinner you planned for your son's first gf. You sounded very excited about meeting her, and you're an experienced hostess, so the chances are good your son forgot to mention it or did so just once when you were distracted by something. Your husband also had no recollection, so it's just a miscommunication.NAH. Have her over again soon, apologize for the misunderstanding without throwing your son under the bus, and cook a great vegan meal or option. Your son must have an idea of what she likes, so start there", "So May YTA for not asking if she had any dietary restrictions. How embarrassing for your son, if he did not tell you", "NTA. You didn\u2019t do it out of malice, it was an honest mistake. Things happen, and your son should not have blown up on you. You can try inviting her over again, and maybe her and you could make something together that she likes.", "NTA. \nKudos on the GF for being mature and handling it with class. \nI second inviting her back for a vegan meal.", "This was your Son's opportunity to excel by cooking his new girlfriend a wonderful vegan meal. He's 17 and can't cook? NTA", "I think NTA. Having a vegan over for dinner when you\u2019re a meat eating household is usually a big deal so I find it hard to believe the son mentioned it to you but didn\u2019t ask what you intended to cook as a substitute. If he indeed asked multiple times, why didn\u2019t he check what you were making as you were making it? \n\nJust as a precaution bring up the memory issues with your doctor anyway.", "NTA even your husband remembers enough to say your son didn't specify veganism. This was on your son. You were welcoming to her. There's no way you would have disregarded that tidbit.", "Do you forget things you\u2019ve been told multiple times like that?  You know for sure that he didn\u2019t actually tell you one time he said he did, since your husband confirmed it.  If you are normally not a forgetful person, then I\u2019d be suspicious that the truth is something more along one of there lines.  One possibility is that he\u2019s lying, perhaps because he\u2019s embarrassed or ashamed that he forgot.  One possibility is that he rehearsed talking to you about it several times and got confused. The last possibility is really unlikely, but there is a chance that your son is like me and occasionally has dreams that are so vivid that they feel like they really happened.  It only happens to me rarely, like I go years between times, but if I\u2019m excited or worried (or both) about something, I\u2019ll sometimes have a dream where I do something related to the thing that I remember as reality.  Like the first time my grad school roommates and I went out to happy hour to get to know each other better, I remember us discussing and agreeing on a place the day before, but both of them swore that the conversation stopped at agreeing that we would do happy hour and didn\u2019t talk about where.  If it was the only time it has happened to me, I\u2019d wonder if they were lying, but since it had happened before and has happened since, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s just a weird thing my brain pops out sometimes.  It\u2019s usually a small but emotionally important event like that, that I believe happened but was just a dream.  The first time it happened to me was in my teens, and it has happened now and then through my adult life.  It can be pretty frustrating, even upsetting, especially when what I remember is not how the other people involved actually react to whatever it is.  But I\u2019ve never heard of someone else doing that, so I do think it\u2019s very unlikely.\n\nNTA.  If you think you actually are forgetful, it\u2019d be a good idea to have somewhere you write down important things about new people in your life (or new things happening with established people), so that you can keep track of things.", "NTA but your son might be.", "NTA. \n\nIf someone is a *strict vegan*, one would think that would be mentioned more than once anyways. Even if your son mentioned it in passing, he should've reminded you again when dinner was approaching or when he knew you were buying groceries. \n\nDid he not notice the ingredients set out or in the fridge ever?", "Nta. I think your son made a mistake. That\u2019s not something you just forget. I know if my kiddo would have told me they were bringing a vegan over for dinner I would have asked a lot of questions like what they like to eat. I can cook vegetarian but vegan is a whole other ballgame. I would have been googling easy vegan meals and such. You seem really upset about this so the odds are your son dropped the ball.", "NTA if you didn't know. Plus you asked her if she wanted you to make something else and she said no. Oh well, she is abundantly clear that you are not vegan now.", "NTA, you\u2019re not psychic. It\u2019s unlikely you would have forgotten your son mentioning that and you certainly would have remembered he said that as soon as you noticed her not eating. Tell him to apologize to her for dropping the ball on not mentioning her dietary restrictions and tell him to invite her over for a redo where you\u2019ll cook something vegan.", "NTA\n\nYour son was likely super embarrassed since her veganism is core to her beliefs. And all his meals with her are likely vegan so he just doesn\u2019t even think about it and just assumed he\u2019d told you.\n\nAlso, if it was so critical, he should\u2019ve asked what you\u2019re making beforehand. That\u2019s on him.\n\nLesson learned and now everyone knows - time to move on. Just invite her over again and cook a proper vegan meal and all will be well.", "NTA\n\nThis is just a miscommunication.", "NTA - you would have remembered if he said, \u201cvegan\u201d and your husband also backed you up. That isn\u2019t something that slips your mind if you have to cook a meal in an entirely different way to accommodate someone.\n\nYour son is 17 and it is just as likely it slipped his mind.\n\nGood luck with this.", "Hard to judge since the whole issue is whether or not you were told. I\u2019d think if you were so excited to have her, you\u2019d remember if your son told you she was vegan. So, I\u2019m inclined to say he didn\u2019t and NTA. But, who knows?", "NTA but it\u2019s still an easy faux pas to fix. invite her over for a re-do and cook all-vegan", "NTA - I don't think he told you, and your husband backs this up. If there's lack of communication between you and your son, you can work on it. For instance, when either one of you is communicating some that's important - make sure you are making eye contact and are engaged with each other. Not looking at TV or devices or doing something else at the same time.", "NTA if neither you nor your husband remember your son mentioning it.", "NTA your son forgot to tell you and blamed it on you", "NTA\n\nApologize to his gf and simply call it a 'miscommunication' and you didn't understand she was vegan. Invite her over again for dinner and ask her to help you cook something vegan.", "Contact his GF, tell her there was a miscommunication,  and ask her to teach you to cook some vegan dishes. That way she'll (hopefully) understand that you weren't trying to be rude to her, but just didn't know. Also there will be one or more things you can cook for her at a later date.", "NTA - If neither you or your husband remember your son telling you his girlfriend was vegan and you were both present for the conversation the chance is high that he didn\u2019t tell you. (2 in 3 probability) \nShe sounds like a nice polite girl who wasn\u2019t rude when her dietary needs weren\u2019t met. \nMaybe invite her for dinner again, and have a vegan sit down meal. \nYou could write out a starter and main course and check if it would be something she would like that have. \nIf you feel bad maybe explain to her you\u2019re sorry about the previous dinner and you didn\u2019t realise she was vegan.", "Fairly sure he didn\u2019t tell you. I have had teen boys. Have a do over. Ask what her favorites are and go to town!", "Wouldn\u2019t your son have smelled the steak when you were cooking it? He could have privately told you what was going on than or he could have asked you early in the day what you were planning on making for dinner\u2026.. since you said you always cook steak and potatoes for guests I find it extremely odd your son didn\u2019t think to ask you/help you pick out an all vegan meal for HIS girlfriend. I\u2019m getting the gist that your not vegans or have ever cooked vegan food so why would your son not ask or help you with this? It\u2019s all on your son. Even if he had told you his girlfriend is vegan\u2026. Shouldn\u2019t he want to help plan a special vegan meal for her or ask you if you need help figuring out what she would like best? It\u2019s not like vegan food is just one and done, there are so many things, and wouldn\u2019t he want you to cook vegan but also something he knows his girlfriend loves? He\u2019s just mad that he looked bad infront of his girlfriend and is blaming it on you, when it\u2019s really all him. I would be asking myself if he\u2019s even mature enough to have a girlfriend if he\u2019s blaming his mommy for his poor planning. Definitely NTA", "No and you will be aware for next time. Perhaps you can ask her to teach you to prepare a dish to her liking if she provides you with ingredients list.", "Nta", "NTA. One of my kids just swore up and down that they told me something important and were very upset. \n\nThey not only didn\u2019t tell me, but they didn\u2019t tell their other parent or their siblings. Idk, it happens.", "NTA - Excuse me, but where was your son while you were cooking dinner? He goes on a rant that it\u2018s important to him because first girlfriend blablabla but is not even there to help you! If it had been one of my teenagers (I have 2), I would have been the one going on a rant! And knowing teenage boys, I would rather think that he totally forgot to tell you but is too stubborn to admit it. The only mistake you did maybe is being proactive and asking him if she had dietary requirements. But that\u2019s an honest mistake and otherwise, you did everything so that she has a pleasant ebening. So stop doubting yourself (even your husband backs you up), tell your son that you won\u2018t accept this behaviour from him, especially sine HE\u2018s the one who screws up. Now, invite the girlfriend again and make her a nice vegan meal - Or invite her to cook with you. This way, she will see that she is welcome at your place and that you have nothing against her being a vegan.", "Okay but like\u2026 vegans make it know that they are vegan within 30 seconds of meeting them. He will likely have relayed this because it will have come up no less than 6942 times since they started dating.", "NTA. Your son needs to grow up.", "It\u2019s not going to last anyways. You probably cock blocked him which is why he is so pissed.", "NTA \n\nHe's 17, he just got upset because dinner wasn't perfect and he took it out on you. Go talk to him about inviting her back for a vegan meal.", "YTA for not checking with your son whether she had any foods she couldn't/doesn't eat. That's a pretty basic courtesy for inviting someone to eat at your home. Don't put the blame on your son, he clearly thinks he told you, but he's also not the one who was in charge of planning and preparing the food. That was you. Making sure your guests can eat it is step one.", "That\u2019s not something you forget.  You did it on purpose and she knew it. YTA", "YTA because even if your son did forget , I don't know how you can say \"it went great\" clearly you are denying something and presenting reality better than it actually was", "NTA - I bet he forgot, and is trying to deflect.  You're obviously a supportive parent, so there's no indication that you were trying to make the gf feel unwelcome, and went out of your way to be welcoming.  That said, it's always good practice to ask about dietary restrictions prior to cooking for guests, especially when dealing with hormonal 17 year old boys in their first flush of relationship.  \n\nI'd invite the girlfriend back for another dinner, apologise, and make sure there are some good vegan options on the menu.  If you're not used to cooking vegan dishes, you could even offer for her to come a bit early and help you in the kitchen to show you some ideas, which might be a nice bonding experience.  She seems like a lovely, polite and respectful girl, and I'm sure if you apologise that you weren't aware she was vegan otherwise you would have catered to her, then she'll understand.", "YTA\n\nMy opinion is when you host guests, you cater to them and their diets. When I have guests over, one of the first things I ask is if anyone has any dietary restrictions.\n\nI think it's a little ridiculous that you're claiming to forget she's vegan. Because even if you forgot, it appears you never had the foresight to ask about her preferences or even mention what was being served.\n\nYou should have asked, the fact that never occurred to you shows a lack of consideration for your guests.\n\nIf I was your son I'd be pissed off and embarrassed.", "So both you and hubby did not get this info but your son insists, this sounds like a son problem.  He forgot to mention it and then turned it around on you.  \n\nMaybe talk to girl and invite her over and promise a vegan dinner.", "NTA. Now you do know, that's ESTABLISHED.\n\nI get his frustration, but it happens. Assume he did tell you; he told you something, and you got it wrong, when it was VERY important for you to get it right.\n\nEither way this whole thing should get moved on from. Again, now you know and it's established that you know.", "NTA he don't tell you this his girlfriend is vegetarian how you support to know information you don't inform . Maybe you make her vegetarian food and invite her to your house again.", "She sounds incredibly polite. Seems like a keeper", "Nta.\n\nYou say you don't remember  being told   And according to your husband you were never told.  \n\nYour son says he told you but he has a new girlfriend and was excited and nervous about her coming over that it sounds like he forgot to say to you and is now taking the fact that he feels like an ass out on you. \n\nYou can't even be slightly considered the bad guy for cooking the wrong things if you wernt told.", "This is (slightly) tricky.\n\nYour son is insistent that he told you she was a vegan.\n\nYour husband is as sure that he did not tell y'all that.\n\nYou say that maybe you just \"forgot\" about it. That claim, combined with Host Cook 101, makes me lean toward you're not being entirely truthful with what you knew your son's girlfriend could eat. If you \"forgot\" about it, that means you asked him about her food preferences. \n\nYour post vibes that you knew what you were(n't) doing, and your husband went along with the story to back you up.\n\nUnless you're one of those Mamma's Boy Mothers, you'd want to make as good an impression with this first girlfriend as she wanted to make in return.", "NTA, vegans can nibble their beans and lettuce", "[removed]", "NTA vegans are intolerable", "OP \u2014NTA \nI think your hubby really needs to buckle down and tell your son firmly that he never said that .\nYou should not apologize for something you did not do \u2014because any future mistake will likely be linked to this mistake \u2014 that you did not make .\nIf this was that important to your son he would have checked  in with you the day before .He did not .", "Not to be an alarmist but consider taking your son to get his brain scanned. My dad's memory got very suspect when he was diagnosed with lymphoma. He started aggressive treatment immediately but passed away within 6 months of his diagnosis.\n\nThe less troubling possibility is your son could have simply forgotten and doesn't want to look like an ass in front of his girlfriend, or forgotten and didn't want to acknowledge it because, well, it would mean he was the ass. It happens.\n\nEither way, NTA. If it means so much to your son, he could have learnt to cook and prepare dinner with you, or just be involved in planning the dinner menu.", "NTA and sorry that you raised such a hothead son. He didn\u2019t tell you. How the fuck would it be your fault? I\u2019d keep telling his entitled ass that he didn\u2019t tell you so if he\u2019s angry he\u2019s angry at himself for being an inconsiderate little sh*t.", "Your son blew it and is trying to blame you.  NTA.", "This is really kind of a non-issue. Your son's being an idiot. So simply invite her over for another meal, and this time make vegan food, explaining to her that you had no idea the first time.

I am new to Reddit and created this account just to be able to get outside opinions, so I hope I do this correctly\n\nI am 40f and have a son 17m, he has just gotten his first girlfriend and both me and his dad were very thrilled by this! We asked him if she would like to come over for dinner so that we could meet her and get to know her. He asked her, told us that she would love to.\nThis was about two weeks ago and we set up a date (the dinner was Thursday night so just yesterday).\n\nI cooked what I always cook when we have guests over (if it is not a specific type of dinner). I just throw together a smaller ceasar salad as an appetizer and then serve a steak with potatoes that I have on the pan with butter, garlic and some bacon. \n\nSince I was cooking I just greeted her while my son, her and my husband was sat in the living room. When dinner was ready, she did not eat anything. My son threw me nasty looks but did not say anything, I asked her if she wanted something else but she just kind off awkwardly said that it was fine. When I bring out the main dish, she did not take anything this time either. I felt so bad that I did not make anything that she liked, I told her that I would love to throw together something for her but she turned my offer down and told me that it was just nice company and the food was not the main part, but she was sure it was good.\n\nIt went great, she left and immediately after my son blew up on me. She asked me why I would cook everything with animal products when I knew she was a strict vegan, I felt kind off bad and thought that I had just forgotten about it, I asked him when he told me that and said I was sorry. He told me he said that when we talked about inviting her for dinner, my husband just chimes in with \u201cNo son, you did not\u201d. My son is still insisting that he told me and that he made sure several times that I was still on track with that, but I have zero recollection of that.\n\nI don\u2019t know if I am just extremely forgetful and he is right, he is so insistent that he told me and I feel like maybe he did, I mean it is his girlfriend and he know I always cook with animal products, so why wouldn\u2019t he?\n\nSo am I the asshole for not cooking anything she could eat? Maybe I should have asked him what she liked to eat and asked if there was something she couldn\u2019t..\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Always take someone out to dinner; that way there are no situations like this.   \n\nI'm not a vegan or anything but I absolutely \\*\\*HATE\\*\\* going to a person's home for dinner before I know them and their family well.    And know how clean they are, especially in the kitchen. :)", "If you don\u2019t remember and your husband doesn\u2019t then it stands to reason your son is mistaken thinking he told you \n\nNTA", "Updateme", "NTA, personally I would invite over for a vegan dinner of her choice, and apologise profusely, even if you don\u2019t recall being told of her dietary needs. The poor girl is probably feeling extremely rejected and may think this is your way of telling her she\u2019s not welcome", "He\u2019s a teenager so he probably forgot himself and trying to blame you. Just invite her over again and cook a nice vegan meal. NAH", "NTA. You did him a favor, dealing with pain in the ass vegans isn't worth all the trouble. Let them eat cake, if they bring there own.", "Questions: is it your style to forget like this? If he had told you would you have prepared a vegan option? Did he never once ask what would be cooked? Did you never once say \"hey kid, still good for dinner tonight, I'll be rolling out my salad, steak and potatoes\"??\n\nIf you would have been accommodating but forgot then NTA.\n\nIf you did know and forgot - ESH, cos, it was a good thing, it was an obvious thing to see and not something allergies related like gluten, nuts, etc.\n\nI have a feeling the kid didn't tell you. NTA", "NTA \n\nVegan dishes can be SO yummy. Someone else suggested inviting her over again, and I second that suggestion. Look up protein packed vegan dishes. (I had this beet soup at a vegan restaurant, it had quinoa in it as well as a nice tart vinagrette that finished it, SOOOO good!) Vegan food can pack as much protein as a steak and still be flavorful. Maybe also ask her if she has suggestions for you to try, too? Good luck, and enjoy the exploration!", "NTA.  If you're not the type of person who would purposefully do this then you weren't told multiple times.  I think your son is looking for a fall guy.  \n\nYour son feels guilty and since I'm SURE he threw you under the bus to his girlfriend you should feel bad too (since she thinks you either didn't care or hate her).  Please invite her back over or take her out and be clear that there was some miscommunication and you didn't know.  \n\nShe sounds like a sweet girl if she was nice and didn't say anything.", "NTA.  But that said, \"any dietary sensitivities or preferences\" is always a good question to ask to prevent mishaps!", "I mean if you forgot something like that YTA if he didn't tell you NTA", "Next time cook a steak and say you want strong grandchildren.", "I mean, clearly NTA. At worst you are forgetful, but since your husband agrees with you this is probably on your son. However, you should talk to his girlfriend and make it clear that there was a miscommunication and you did not know she was vegan. Otherwise she may think that you did this on purpose.", "NTA\n\nTake the fall for your son if you want, but I feel like at least you or your spouse would remember your son mentioning that his gf doesn't eat animal products. A friend I haven't seen in over 10 years told me 17 years ago that she's allergic to cinnamon, and I still remember it. And I don't even remember what I ate for lunch yesterday.\n\nIf you need/want, I know a shit ton of vegan brands and have even created my own recipes.\n\nMy boyfriend is vegan, but I am not. However, I eat mostly vegan food because it is more convenient to just buy food we can both eat, and I just enjoy food that tastes good. Whether or not it's \"close enough\" is irrelevant as long as the flavors are good. So Beyond and Impossible Meat have excellent meat substitutes, violife has great dairy substitutes, and Miyoko's and Daiya are great depending on what you're making. Hell, you can make tacos using Ortega taco kits if she's a vegan that avoids palm oil", "NTA  \nI can see you forgetting once, but multiple times and your husband too? Unless there's a carbon monoxide leak in your home affecting everyone's memory then your son messed up.  At 17 it's easier to blame his parents than to admit to his girlfriend that he totally spaced on telling you something so important to her.  \n\nYou've apologized to your son for the mixup, that wasn't even your fault.Stop beating yourself up about it.  If your son was so concerned, he should have gone over the menu with you, helped you shop, picked out recipes etc...\n\nArrange a do-over dinner, start fresh.", "Why wouldn't he tell you? Because he's a teenager and they tend to be forgetful of things that don't apply directly to themselves.\n\nAsk yourself honestly, knowing how much this dinner would mean to your kid, would you really have forgotten something like that if you'd even heard it once? Do you often tune him out when it comes to stuff like that?\n\nIt really sounds like he dropped the ball and is embarrassed and trying to blame you to save face with her, especially since your husband seems pretty certain he never heard it. You don't deserve that but you're very sweet for taking the fall anyway. Don't let him keep gaslighting you though, 17 is old enough to start taking responsibility for your own goofs. NTA", "NTA, you're is behaving like a massive one in this situation though", "If I had to guess, he probably mentioned it while using a phone with air pods in... and didn't realize you didn't hear him.\n\nJust offer to make a vegan meal and see how that goes...", "NTA, and also, maybe teach your son about how to handle situations that bother him? Blowing up on anyone, including their own mother, is not a very attractive look on anyone.", "NTA, vegans suck, and you shouldn't let your son associate with such people. I'm just playing, you're still not the AH though. I'm sure from the way you tell the story, that he did not tell you about that. You sound like a great mom and I think that if he had informed you, you would have made a big effort to keep it in the front of your mind until the day came, your excitement for him bringing his first girl over for dinner only makes that more reason for you to want everything to go well. I doubt you'd forget about such a thing, and yes it is possible, but I find it highly unlikely.", "NAH which is refreshing on this sub. Cooking a vegan meal soon for her would be the best way to remedy the situation. You seem like a great mom.", "Nah, fuck him. He is gaslighting you cos he forgot to mention it. \n\nBut, hormones. Haha. \n\nJust invite her again and give her an organic carrot. Solved.", "NTA. Your son definitely didn\u2019t tell you even your husband said that. He\u2019s probably mad at himself and is taking it out on you. Now that you know you could always invite her over again and make a vegan dish.", "NTA\n\nI'm honestly so confused why your son or his girlfriend said nothing about it throughout the meal or while you were cooking even. That seems like something you would remember being told. Especially if it meant changing the usual type of meal you would prepare for company. That she didn't say anything about why she didn't want the food strikes me as very strange. Avoiding conflict is one thing but that is just weird.", "Ik it's off topic but your husband sounds like a good guy.", "I think maybe your son is the forgetful one", "omg. dunno what to say to this but NTA\n\nwhoops wrong judgement", "NTA, seems like he forgot to tell you.  He should be involved in planning dinner for his guests and would have caught the issue earlier. \n\n\nLook up easy vegan recipes.  Don't try complicated cuisine you're not used to-i saw someone recommending Thai curries to you.  They're great but if you're not normally eating Thai flavors or food that's a big jump. \n\nTry a nice pasta with a vegan pesto or clean simple marinara with fresh herbs- tomatoes,  Basil, oregano etc.  beautiful, fresh salad with veggies you're used to with a Italian vinaigrette. Pair that with a berry dessert or buy a vegan ice cream for a simple,  quick meal you'll feel confident in making and eating. \n\nIf it's cold by you,  look up a nice warm vegan soup- roasted corn with coconut milk,  peppers etc (great recipe on Cotters crunch that you can do on a blender then heat) pair that with a nice loaf of hot bread,  bought or baked,  you can buy vegan \"butter\" to spread, do a roasted Brussel sprout or other veggie in the oven as a side dish with herbs or balsamic glaze.  Hot cocoa with oat milk for dessert? \n\nTalk to your son about grace and ownership,  you're showing both qualities and his girlfriend showed grace. He's growing up and it's the time to plant the seed so he can bloom later!", "I'm not sure I believe the story. You'd think a teenager would tell you they were vegan or that they don't eat meat or animal products when it turns out that dinner is a steak.", "NTA. If you did it on purpose though, that'd be totally different.", "He probably meant to tell you and kinda forgot he didn't.\n\nNTA, but next time you have a new guest over you should be proactive about asking them (or asking the family member who invited them) if they have any food restrictions. Also, maybe start making some sides that are a bit more *customizable*? Like, if you'd baked the potatoes everybody could've chosen their toppings. If you hadn't put the dressing on the salad, she could've opted to have oil and vinegar.", "Regardless of who is right between you and your son, the girlfriend sounds lovely!", "NTA. That\u2019s kinda some nerve if he assumes you did it maliciously but he\u2019s probably not thinking straight and just lashing out. Your intentions were good hearted for your son and you went above and beyond for this dinner so it hurts you I\u2019m sure. Even if he mentioned it once in conversation it\u2019s careless that he never checked in with you.   It was his responsibility to communicate better, he\u2019s probably embarrassed and defensive because it\u2019s a new relationship and he doesn\u2019t want to spoil it and now only in retrospect can he possibly spot the error in his mishandling but maybe he\u2019s doubling down. My boy isn\u2019t a teen yet, but he\u2019s pulled some similar stuff recently.  \u201cI told you about such and such\u201d and after trying to work out the miscommunication it might ring a bell but it might not totally register if it was in the middle of a lot of information all at once. I hope you two work it out peacefully soon. If the girlfriend comes over for another meal, apologize for the misunderstanding or miscommunication but don\u2019t go deep or make it a conversation or even involve your son, just leave it at that, don\u2019t make it a whole thing, let the couple work it out. I imagine if she comes she absolutely won\u2019t pry about the past time.   Your son is nerved about it, it\u2019s not right how he\u2019s acting with unaccountability. It seems like a defense mechanism and he\u2019s probably having a lot of trouble navigating.  He should own this mistake and have a conversation with her himself a bit.  Trust him to do it his way though, don\u2019t force him to or anything, but a little bit of encouragement to communicate is good.  He needs to learn that mistakes and miscommunication isn\u2019t the end of the world, there\u2019s always ways to work it all out, and that you\u2019re a good safe person for him to work those things out with. You and dad and son can definitely fix this with some good conversations and guidance and understanding.  Before you get there, there might still be some anger and stupid commentary but I just think you all can reach each other. Hang in there mom! \n\nThe other thing I can\u2019t ignore is that the girl herself never said anything. Being vegan isn\u2019t a secret. She must have a big heart and compassion for people because the best explanation I can surmise is she probably didn\u2019t want to embarrass you or him in the moment or spoil your family\u2019s dinner that you spent time and love into. But still, she held to her own morals in that dilemma and didn\u2019t eat meat to appease anyone.  She probably a very emotionally-intelligent person.", "You don't recall him saying she's vegan, your husband days he didn't, and your son says he did. Two against one. He forgot to say anything.\n\nNTA", "Girlfriend is the AH. Unless there is a medical reason, you eat what is provided when you are a guest.", "NTA I hope that she, too, wasn\u2019t upset about the dinner. if she was being honest, that the fellowship that you were having was more important than food, your son has a very awesome girlfriend, Regardless, you did make an attempt to give her another option.  \n\nI agree now that you know her preference of vegan, you accommodate her next time she is invited for dinner.\n\nMaybe, you may like it and incorporate that into your diet .", "NAH but u would be one if u don't keep vegan options for her from now on", "NTA. As someone with dietary restrictions, I always make sure to tell the host ahead of time. Sometimes it happens that someone forgets or doesn\u2019t realize that a product contains ingredients that I can\u2019t eat. It totally happens, and that\u2019s okay. It really is more about the company than the food. A lot of times I\u2019ll offer to bring something that I know I can for sure eat (ex. I\u2019ll offer to bring a salad or side dish). You were very gracious to offer to make something else and she declined. I would, however, be livid with my partner for not double checking that there was something I can eat. Your son is young, but this is a good lesson for him that he should double check these kinds of things when he makes plans for a partner, especially in his own home. He obviously saw you cooking steak and knows what you typically prepare, it would have been easy for him to remind you not to dress the salad or something. Whether or not he initially told you, he should have double checked during the cooking process.", "NTA,  I am pretty certain your son was lax in communicating clearly this important fact.  Be glad it was not a deathly allergy.\n\nI do, as a matter of practice, ask if there are any dietary restrictions I should know about when cooking for a person I don't know.   \n\nAs others have said, put it down to a misunderstanding and invite her again. \n\nNot calling anyone wrong, but gaslighting is a real thing . Teens do it a lot by nature, but it is a poor habit to cultivate.", "NTA, but you definitely should ask if a person has any restrictions when having them over for dinner the first time.  Practically everyone has some kind of restriction these days.", "NTA! \n\nYou sound so sweet. So does the GF. He\u2019s a teen, they blow up lol whatever. Use this as a teaching moment for him speak up IN the moment when something isn\u2019t right even if it\u2019s to a grown up, & to remind ppl of important stuff and to communicate. Like a \u201chey what are you planning on cooking, can I help you?\u201d Etc. \n\nYou\u2019ll laugh at this in 5ish years with him", "Personally, I have a food allergy, if someone doesn\u2019t know or is new in my life, I don\u2019t expect them to remember anything about my food allergy. If it\u2019s someone who\u2019s known me for a long time? yes, but this was your first meeting and it would be on your son to remind you and make sure she could eat food. As a girlfriend I would be upset with my boyfriend for not making sure beforehand that his mom was aware and that my food allergy was not within my food. It\u2019s his relationship not his moms and on first meeting I don\u2019t expect her to know or understand my food restrictions and the extent they go. You are NTA, it\u2019s your sons first relationship so him being in a relationship is new to him and you guys. It\u2019s ok to mess up and you offered to make something for her, she denied and that\u2019s ok.", "NTA. Biggest chance is your son forgot and is trying to blame you. \n\nBut might be worth checken on CO in the house just in case?", "As a vegan, NTA.\n\nIt was really nice of you to offer to make her something else when she wasn't eating. Many of us get nervous about asking to be accommodated like this because of the reputation vegans get online, we don't want people to think we're being pushy or annoying, so simply not eating anything may have felt like the less nervous solution for her. \n\nYour son didn't need to be so rude about it, especially when he might not have even told you in the first place! At his age with his first girlfriend though he might just be nervous I suppose. \n\nAnother dinner date sounds like a great idea :) vegan cooking doesn't have to be too intimidating! Lots of easy recipes for things like nachos with beans, Italian pasta dishes with tomatoes, olives, garlic etc. I hope you find something you all like!", "Nta, your husband was also there and said he didn\u2019t mention it.\n\nRegardless, I'd suggest you try a 2nd dinner, either vegan at home or a vegan friendly restaurant. Or at least let the young woman know it wasn't intentional and you'll have better options for her next time.", "NTA.  Inviting someone to your house for dinner to be told that their eating habits are very different to what is usual in that house is going to stick in your mind.\n\nYour son is blaming you for what he didn't tell you to save face in front of his girl.\n  \nYou both need to draw a line and move on.\n\nLearning opportunity for both,  for you to ask if a guest had any likes or dislikes, situation depending.  For him, that it is important to pass on relevant information, that communication is key and that owning up to mistakes and appologisising is less problematic than lying and starting fights.", "Nope, your son screwed up and isn\u2019t grown up enough to back down. I\u2019m sorry. \n\nNTA", "I think that is a good solution! Thanks!", "Good idea! This situation could easily be fixed this way.", "Yes, cause she was really gracious and understanding, and I am rather impressed. No vegan rant or mean words.", "Or vegetarian. Check out Indian vegetarian recipes", "Assuming that everyone involved had good/pure intentions, then it's just a missunderstanding or lack of communication. The past is the past. Focus on the future and create another event with food that the girlfriend will eat as MyNextVacation wrote.\n\nEdit:  Will she eat only if everyone is eating vegan food or is she okay with others eating non-vegan in front of her while she eats vegan food?", "Exactly. If you partner is vegan and meeting your parents, you don\u2019t mention it in passing once. You double check by asking about the menu or verifying specifically what your vegan gf will be able to eat and if you should bring anything vegan from your house.", "Especially if you are not used to cooking vegan meals, it would have been appropriate if he asked his girlfriend for some suggestions ahead of time and worked through those suggestions with you.\n\nAlso it sounds like you put a pretty standard dinner together for guests so presumably at some point he has noticed that you serve steaks with a Caesar salad. So he really should have worked through some alternate menu ideas with you.\n\nI would sum this up to the girlfriend with \"There was some menu / diet confusion. I'm super sorry for my part in that, I hope you'll accept my apology and I'd like to make you an apology dinner.\"", "This is what I think, esp given how difficult it would be to cook a vegan meal when you don't normally do it. He really should have checked on what the meal was going to be.", "Yeah this reality is why I had to put a hard boundary on these kinds of things. No one has access to the truth, so drop the blame and fix it. It's hard to be in a family.", "See, that seems very real for a teen boy who needs to cover his own ass", "Could she not have eaten the salad? I don\u2019t know much about vegan meals so I honestly don\u2019t know.", "I think it's way more likely a 17 year old forgetting to mention something and then doubling down that it's not his fault.", "Quite likely the son forgot and is trying to cover his ass with his girlfriend", "My grandma had Alzheimer\u2019s, so I would just hope that it is not the case as I saw what it did to her.. but thanks for your concern and probably will do", "Her husband was there and confirmed that the son did not say so in the conversation. I don't think it is memory loss issue (still ask at the next Dr appointment, good to be proactive). I think son made a mistake, and did not mention it. Now he is doubling down and making OP doubt herself and doesn't want to own up to his part in all of this. OP, you seem like a decent person who is horrified by what happened. Invite girlfriend back over and tell her you want to learn more about being vegan and how to cook for someone who follows it. Ask what her favorite meal is and cook it together. It would be a great bonding experience and a way to set the relationship back on the right foot. I don't think you meant any harm.", "If you think it's just a miscommunication, why NTA instead of NAH?", "LMFAO it's his GF that he's inviting over. That's entirely on him to mention. His failure to communicate is on him.", "You need to think happier thoughts.", "Lmao, OP's husband also says that their son didn't mention her being vegan. Victim boner much?", "The other parts of the whole evening went great. We talked a lot during and after dinner, got to know her and she was a really polite and sweet girl.", "The husband clearly stated that the son did NOT mention it. He's the one inviting the GF. It's on him to communicate that.", "My mom would have to, I am actually a millennial and not a Generation X", "I definitely will! I have tried to read about vegan foods and snacks, so will try to always have some at home if she continues to come over!", "And if you\u2019re not sure exactly what to cook for her, invite her over to help prepare?", "OP, he's probably extremely embarrassed. As you mentioned, this is his first girlfriend and it was his first time inviting her over to meet you. He's learning how to navigate a relationship for the first time and he's probably worried she will break up with him.\n\nYou're NTA but I would do him a solid here and take the fall. Dating is a skill that requires practice like any other skill. In the grand scheme it's a small mistake but it probably feels like the sky is falling in his head because he lacks perspective. \n\nThis is a learning experience for him and hopefully it's a lesson that will stick with him in the future. Down the road he will probably appreciate what you did.", "Just state there was a miscommunication the next time she comes over and that you weren\u2019t trying to make her uncomfortable", "If you do a vegan feast I recommend this for dessert. My son\u2019s girlfriend is vegan and she loved it, as did everyone else, non vegans included. Made it several times now. Delicious! https://www.nigella.com/recipes/lemon-tendercake-with-blueberry-compote", "NTA. Kudos on the GF for being mature and handling it with class. I second inviting her back for a vegan meal.", "Make sure that you can find a way to cook vegan food in a way that doesn\u2019t cross contaminate. I know it sounds crazy but even if you wash the pan, some vegans won\u2019t accept food that was cooked in the same pan that once had animal in it", "Apologize and say it was a miscommunication issue and don't put blame on anyone.", "Most of us veggies and vegans do have enough manners to graciously decline food without going on a rant. Unfortunately it's usually the outliers you hear about, especially if the story makes it into Reddit", "believe it or not, most vegetarians/vegans aren\u2019t walking around ready to go off on anyone who dares to mention meat in their presence. those people are actually very rare, if they exist at all.", "Maybe she\u2019s a real person. Half the rants you read about from Vegans posted op on Reddit are from strawman vegans made up by assholes posting for attention.", "Why would there be a vegan rant or mean words? WTAF.", "Most don't do that.\n\nThe vegans/vegetarians who do rant are assholes, it has nothing to do with their veganism", "Not every vegan wants a conflict, but that she didn't say anything is weird.", "It\u2019s \u201cmom, what\u2019s for dinner tonight? This girl I\u2019m bringing over doesn\u2019t eat meat\u2026\u201d see? Less than 3 seconds and the evening would not have been ruined. \n\nHis fault entirely. Hopefully he understands that", "It\u2019s not difficult at all to make a vegan meal, even if you\u2019re not used to it. Buy another salad dressing. Make pasta. Use olive oil instead of butter on vegetables. Anyone who can cook a steak can make these tiny changes. It would\u2019ve been nice for OP\u2019s son to help but it\u2019s nowhere near necessary.", "Well, that could be true, but that would imply that he is both quick-witted and willing to throw his mother under the bus at the drop of a hat.", "Caesar salad is typically not vegan or vegetarian. It usually contains anchovies and cheese. It\u2019s then garnished with cheese and croutons. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t assume croutons were vegan. Cheese is a no go. Unless the dressing is on the side, it\u2019s probably not vegan.", "caesar salad is actually a pain in the butt to make vegan imo", "To be honest if that was the case I\u2019d lean into that. Start to freak out. How could I possibly have forgotten if you definitely told me so many times?

If she catches it early she can get on the right diet, exercise and crossword puzzle routine, there's medicines that slow the effect. Even video games apparently make an impact. With something this potentially life-altering I would tend to err on the side of extreme paranoia.", "Even your husband says your son didn't tell you. While it's always better to err on the side of caution...my grandmother had Alzheimer's...I'm betting your son didn't tell you and just doesn't want his girlfriend to be mad at him.", "When I had thyroid problems, I had horrible memory lapses. Whole conversations that I had no recollection of. He probably didn't tell you, but if you're worried and plan to see your doctor, ask them to test your thyroid.", "Yes please do! Family history is the number one risk factor. Hoping for the best. And it does sound like your son has met a charming girl and this awkwardness will all blow over quickly.", "NTA- super awkward moment though, for sure.\n\nAre you prone to forgetting things? Or having ADHD/ADD moments? I can sometimes have a conversation with my mum and she\u2019ll respond accordingly (usually simple responses) but won\u2019t remember it later if she\u2019s distracted. It drives me batty, but she can\u2019t help it lol. \n\nWould his anger/frustration level be because this isn\u2019t uncommon? If it\u2019s not typical for you, I would make note of it and schedule a Drs appointment\u2026 it could be caused by numerous things, including simply low iron, anemia, hormonal imbalances, etc\u2026 so I wouldn\u2019t get to worried.\n\nBut I\u2019m leaning towards he\u2019s a dumb@ss kid who probably thinks he told you, but didn\u2019t\u2026 or a miscommunication. \n\nPreparing a vegan meal isn\u2019t easy for someone who doesn\u2019t normally. He should have been more involved and coordinated with you about what to make anyways\u2026 instead of saying his girlfriend is vegan and leaving it up to you to figure out. \n\nI\u2019m sure if you make the next meal murder free all will be good lol.

What I'm basically saying is the damage is already done at this point", "I get that, but how reasonable is it that OP.and husband not only do not remember this conversation taking place initially, OP also doesn't remember the several follow ups the son mentions? \n\nIn the balance or probabilities it is extremely unlikely, and much more likely a teenager forgot something, is embarassed and is putting that responsibility on others.", "It doesn\u2019t all, but a lot of it has shrimp paste, you have to check.", "That's fair.

That\u2019s their cue to let me know if they have any issues. I love to cook for family and friends. Some are picky and hate seasoning besides salt and pepper. One friend is glutton free. Another does not like onions due to indigestion. I use a lot of venison and other wild game and my best gf will only eat store bought meats. It\u2019s a huge pain in the ass but I do my best to accommodate who I am cooking for that night. I don\u2019t feel I should have to ask people their dietary needs. I feel that if I invite you than you should let me know. I, myself, am a picky eater. I am sure to check menus before dining at a new restaurant, or find out what is being served at a venue for a wedding or something. If someone invites me to dinner I simply say I\u2019m picky, I wish I wasn\u2019t, but these are things I just won\u2019t eat.", "Saying you don't like an entire cuisine rubs me the wrong way.

We don't know who is in the wrong for whether or not OP's kid said anything (but also, the father only denied a single instance, not multiple). But OP made no effort to find out whether the food she was going to make was going to be an issue for their guest. They're an asshole for that.", "Absolutely. I think this is really a NAH situation, though. OP should have asked about dietary requirements, and OP's son should have communicated more clearly that his gf is vegan, but neither of them is particularly an AH for an oversight (unless it's part of a wider pattern of behaviour). And it's a situation that's very easily resolved just by saying to the gf \"I'm so sorry, I didn't know you were vegan and I should have asked. Would you like to come over for dinner again next week?\".\n\nNo need for anyone to be a fall guy or make a big deal out of it, just use it as an opportunity to ask for a redo.", "But it tends to have similar flavor elements and shared ingredients, so if you don\u2019t like those, you are unlikely to enjoy most Thai dishes. This is not a thing unique to Thai food - most cuisine styles will have common elements that turn up frequently due to availability and simply what people have developed a preference for, like levels of salt, sweet, sour, bitter, etc. \n\nSo while it is entirely possible there are a handful of dishes not like anything else in a cuisine, in most cases it\u2019s not worth the trial and error to find those.", "Ooh. I was going to check out a local Asian supermarket tomorrow as it happens! (One of my travel activities is checking out cool grocery stores. \ud83d\ude02) I\u2019ll look for that!

I had no idea until then that she hated me (we had never met) and wanted him to find someone else. Horrifically awkward, unpleasant time, and after a couple of days of this I ended up going to a gas station mart to get peanut butter and jelly and hide it in our room so I could eat food. We broke up not long after. She was one of those momzillas you hear about. There was no winning. \n\nSince unfortunately people like this exist, I would make sure this poor girl understands this was an honest mistake and your son apparently forgot to tell you, and invite her back for a meal she can eat. \n\nBut I have to ask you, when you saw she wasn\u2019t eating anything, why did you not take your son aside and ask your son what was the problem, apologize to her and bring out some peanut butter or anything? When somebody is being polite but not eating, there\u2019s a reason. Obviously she\u2019s young and doesn\u2019t want to make a scene, she had no idea if you were deliberately trying to insult her or be mean. This poor girl got nothing to eat while everyone ate all around her. This was really rude. Most people have some type of food that isn\u2019t meat, cereal, fruit, anything. \n\nI\u2019m saying YTA because you didn\u2019t try to fix it while she was there. For all you knew she could have had allergies and been unable to eat it. And there are a lot of people who are very hostile to vegetarianism and would do that on purpose to be insulting because they\u2019re assholes. She didn\u2019t know. She just knew nobody cared about her enough to feed her. \n\nDo better, mom. There will be other dates with girls who may have food issues too. What if she was diabetic and couldn\u2019t eat certain foods? Find out in advance.

I think your son could have handled it better, but I don't blame him for being mad that you forgot a major thing about his first girlfriend. \n\nI agree that the best course of action would be to invite her back and cook her a nice vegan meal.

You did nothing wrong - just say you're sorry about the misunderstanding to help him feel better about the thing because he is only a teen and still learning how to do all this social norms stuff. Teens can feel shame far more deeply than older people, so he needs to hear he's not a total screw-up.

Totally navigable and not a big deal, just teen emotions doing what teen emotions do", "Exactly - OP seems conscientious and accommodating.

It's more likely that in his nervousness the son is the one who forgot to tell them and is now blowing up because he feels awful about it and dissnt want to get dumped.", "Exactly, it's crazy he didn't at least ask what she was making - especially with special requirements. Definitely his blunder and he's not admitting it.", "I'm not sure why it isn't vegetarian/vegan.\n\nI think possibly because the nature of processing grapes for wine involves a bunch of insects dying. \n\n\nSo I suppose on that level it's really about how strict you are in your diet. \n\nI just know some of my wines have suitable for vegetarian on them and some then specifically call out 'not suitable'\n\n\nI have some wine based vinegar...so...same thing I assume ?", "do you think that bees aren't animals..? honey is bee vomit. it comes from bees. they aren't just stirring nectar and pollen together to make it.", "Which like, he\u2019s 17. Why the hell does he think gaslighting his parents is better than just admitting her forgot to tell them? Wtf", "Fish. Isinglass is used for clarifying many things including some wines.", "Omg they're animals? No way.\n\nOfc ik they're animals but they don't out any of themselves into the honey and it doesn't come from their bodies, so to me it's not an animal byproduct.", "it does come from their bodies lmao. i think you need to research how bees make honey.", "Man, I wish I was glutton free \ud83d\ude23", "No it doesn't. Maybe you should do research. They collect nectar and pollen and when they put into the honeycomb it breaks down into sugar and they flap their wings to evaporate moisture.", "NTA.\n\nHe never told you.", "Exactly. Given that he knows his family is not vegan, he should have double-checked what the menu was, and he probably should have offered some suggestions on meal ideas. Especially because it seems that this particular meal is OP's go-to for guests, which means the sun would have known that.", "Especially if it is a dietary requirement, you know your family is very unfamiliar with accommodating", "I have had some people telling me \"sorry, I'm gonna talk about meat...\" or \"I had this steak..oh sorry, I didn't want to upset you\"...\nThat's actually very sweet, but still kinda weird \ud83d\ude05!", "Okay, I've seen some good points about this, and I understand now. Yeah, lmao, the fig wasps sure are something. It's a heck of a fun fact.", "Your kid I'd gadlighting you and you as the parent need to put an end to it and not coddle your son. \n\nYour husband agrees that your son said nothing, so it's most likely he forgot yo mention is until he realized at dinner. \n\nThis is your son's making and he needs to step up and take responsibility for his mistake and apologe and fix it. \n\nNOT YOU. \n\nYou are NOT at fault, you son is. This is a lesson for him t learn and if you don't makr him take responsibility and do it for him what's he learning. That mommy will always fix his mistakes. \n\nNo, he needs to take responsibility for this one not you. \n\nYou can invite her over again, and mention that had you known she was vegan you wouldn't have made meat. \n\nDo not tell her it was your fault. Don't ruin your relationship with the new gf so your kid doesn't have to feel bad. \n\nYour kid should feel bad, because his mistake meant his gf didn't get to eat. \n\nThis is his fault and he needs to step up act right and the fault, or he'll always blame you and look at you to fix his mistakes.", "I second this. As a former young guy he is prolly terrified he is gonna fuck it up with her somehow, and is overly sensitive to anything he sees that could endanger his relationship. \n\nDon't take the fall, that will set a bad precedent, but a miscommunication is more than sufficient.\n\nNew girlfriends are nerve wracking. First even more so.", "This. It is unlikely this girl is going to be his forever relationship. It's more important that he learns a hard lesson about communicating the needs of his loved ones. Think about the (possible) grandchildren.", "It's different levels of blame.  Boyfriend being a doofus and forgetting to tell his mum Vs mom deliberately passive aggressively serving steak to a vegetarian. It would likely ruin the relationship forever.", "Everyone's different that way I suppose. For me, if it's not recorded the first time there's a decent chance it'll just be blank, no memory left to retrieve. But I might be a little weird as far as that goes. Definitely makes me feel a little lathe of heaven sometimes though. Might as well be switching between universes a little sometimes, so I just take it for granted that I can't fully trust my memories and prepare accordingly.", "Because he\u2019s 17.", "Speaking from experience of also being 17 several years ago.\n\nThe most likely reason is that he forgot, he knows he forgot and he's lying because he doesn't want to admit he screwed up.", "This exactly. OP since you say you cook basically the same meal for company, if your son HAD told you she was vegan you would have immediately been coming up with a new meal idea or at least thinking about that you would have to. Unless you are normally a very forgetful or uncaring person, and you sound like neither, there is no way he communicated clearly and you just forgot. \n\nAs far as taking the fall, honestly I think it is better that he admits to her that he thought he told you but that it turns out he didn\u2019t. Teens know how teens can be and will handle that better than thinking her boyfriend\u2019s parents already dislike her enough to intentionally serve food she couldn\u2019t eat. And honest apology, along with my mom feels so bad this happened she would like a do over dinner will go a long way with most girls.", "This is the main issue at hand. Kid needs to take on more personal responsibility and quit expecting mom to do everything including reading his mind. \n\nThen again I may be biased, because I have a 16 year old relative who regularly demands that his 76 year-old grandma come over to clean his room because he wants to have some friends over and his room is a sty. If he wants to have friends over and not be embarrassed by his filthy room, then he can clean it himself!"]}
