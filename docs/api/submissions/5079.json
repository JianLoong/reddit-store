I left and she eventually wiped after a while but when I picked her up and carried her to the bed she was crying and angry at me.

Sometimes you don\u2019t have a choice. Our healthcare system is wretched in the US, no matter how you look at it.", "Depends on the person/situation.

But how awesome is your hubby (and most nurses are also)!  I hope all is well now.", "I needed some help with wiping after my csection. There was no twisting or bending enough to wipe without excruciating pain, even with pain meds. My husband had to help a lot with anything that involved  anything below my torso. It felt humiliating but my husband was a saint during my torso.\n\nBut also fortunately for him due to extended labor I was constipated for quite some time so it was only a brief period I needed help with that", "I work in healthcare, trust me, the nurse didn't bat an eye.", "or have both arms out of commission. from experience, wiping while your lower back is in spasm is... interesting fun. Not as fun as having said back give out halfway to the seat and landing on it, setting off a bigger spasm and suddenly being acquainted with how \"cold sweat\" is way more accurate than you were prepared for. Did not pass out on the toilet, lived to look back on the entire time with a sense of horror.", "Not being able to walk you're so ill is hospital worthy imo. At the minimum urgent care so they can decide to send you to a hospital or treat you there. \n\nThis isn't the sniffles or something.

We luckily have Insurance now but damage was done. he lost sight in 1 eye and most in the other from the effects of diabetes going unchecked, his A1C was 12 something at the hospital and we have gotten him down to 5.5. He developed a secondary disease in his stomach, which they say is common for people with diabetes, gastroparesis which for some causes uncontrollable vomiting. He has good days and bad. I would have been more creative about finding him Dr's if I had realized before, but hindsight is 20/20", "Plus think of how much extra load this put on the healthcare system. Rather than going in several days earlier where they probably would have been given antibiotics, possibly IV overnight in a regular hospital ward, they were admitted to ICU for a week with round the clock intense supervision.", "I've gotta admit, many of us are quite envious of you guys in Canada. For the most part you're national programs and policies actually make sense!", "I mean, sure, here in Canada we will cover acute care and \\*some\\* medications... but if you need long term support, mental health care, accessible housing, or any kind of complex needs, what you get is closer to 'well, assisted suicide is legal now' than any actual meaningful help.", "I'm so glad you are able to get the right care for your family, thank you for the kind words!", "In the US and I had my son 3 months early. He spent 2 months in the NICU and the bill for that was over a million. Obviously nobody is going to pay the hospital a million dollars. We had to pay the deductible of 6,850 dollars, but negotiated it down to 3,200. Not too shabby for a million dollar bill but are they kidding? We always joke that he\u2019s a million dollar baby (I guess it\u2019s not a joke though).", "Same, I just broke my ankle slipping on the ice outside my house and was in the hospital all night Friday.

And our insurance is damn expensive", "I have really good insurance. I pay for it, but it\u2019s worth it. I see several specialists and I take a lot of medications.

It should not be the place where known diabetes is treated when you're in crisis. It should not be the place where you go for a CT scan to check up on a known condition.\n\nBut our healthcare system is so messed up that the ER is handling all that stuff. Patients don't have, can't afford, or can't see a primary care physician, so they go to the ER when they or their kids have a generic sinus infection or cold. Patients with known diabetes can't afford insulin, so they get rushed to the ER for a couple doses and then left to fend for themselves again. Well-insured patients (that would be me) can't get into the imaging center (4 weeks was what they told my doctor in the same hospital system) because it has limited staffing and hours (a choice by the hospital system), so we get sent to the ER for an imaging test that isn't an emergency, but is urgent, and then our insurance is billed more (hey, maybe that's why the hospital system decided to limit the hours and staffing of the imaging center?).\n\nFinest healthcare in the world, I tell ya!", "Oh I'm so sorry for your loss, I'm sure it was hard to lose them.", "Wow. I'm so sorry. That's absolutely terrible.  Absolutely no excuse for this at all. Except that we live in the USA where profits and greed come before anything else.", "I've been chronically ill my entire life. My parents took me to the best doctors, never let me know when they struggled, and I still had an incredibly privileged life. But I was also a smart and nosy child who found the medical bills and knew it was a lot of money. As an adult, I still refuse to go to the ER unless I'm too incapacitated to resist or in so much pain that I'm screaming. And that's with really good health insurance, too. Healthcare here is a nightmare.", "Many urgent cares provide IV drips. Mine definitely does. They also do stitches and have an xray machine. But I live in LA.", "Even then, $250 is still better than going to the ER. \nThe argument is food poisoning doesn't warrant an ER visit which can result in bills upwards of 1k (even with good insurance).", "I'm saying if you *don't* have insurance, it's cheaper to pay out of pocket at an urgent care than an ER.\n \nIn your example, if you didn't have insurance, you could still go to that urgent care you mentioned and pay up front for an out-of-pocket visit.", "Same here! It\u2019s good to do research. People (understandably) don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve got options. Just don\u2019t take the weewoo wagon unless you\u2019ve got coverage because that shit\u2019s more likely to be a hassle than an ER these days. \n\nAlso because it was passed fairly quietly, people should also be aware of the No Surprises Act: https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-a-surprise-medical-bill-and-what-should-i-know-about-the-no-surprises-act-en-2123/\n\nBasically if you\u2019ve got insurance, and your treatment is considered out of network, _they are legally not allowed to bill you for it._ Surprise billing for out of network services that you were not aware were out of network is illegal. If you\u2019re uninsured, they have to provide a good faith estimate of what you\u2019re going to pay. \n\nOur healthcare system is shitty and broken and I\u2019ve got enough medical trauma from it to last me two lifetimes myself. But one of the most heinous things about it is that they try to hide from you that you _do_ have options and rights as a patient in terms of payment. \n\nI suggest people read more about the No Surprises Act. I did my best to summarize but I\u2019m running on two hours of sleep here so I may have missed something in my description. But yeah. \n\nIt does NOT apply to ground ambulances though. If you\u2019re not 100% sure the weewoo wagon will be covered, do not use it unless you have _zero_ choice\n\nETA: also ALWAYS call your insurance company if you get a big unexpected bill in the mail, especially if they haven\u2019t sent you a denial. First off you can appeal the claim if that\u2019s what happened. Second, sometimes medical practices straight up lie. Had an ambulance company try to bill me claiming my insurance didn\u2019t cover it. My insurance never received a bill from them. Not only that, but because I get Medicaid it was straight up illegal for the company to bill me.", "That's because the ACA doesn't address the actual problem: the fact that the US predicates healthcare on a profit-based private insurance industry.

I'm 100% sure that you did the very best you could have.

I don't have diabetes but I spent 5 years in a wheelchair after some crazy rare pre and postpartum issues. It affects way more than the gut as well. My esophagus, teeth, tongue etc have been casualties. I am not sure if you have looked into it, but there are diets geared around it. I spent 2 years on a specialty all liquid diet, and now can do solid foods. I eat a lot of small meals. That and certain foods are more calming and easier to digest.

Universal healthcare would be less expensive and more effective, but we're Americans so we can't have nice things... SMH.", "That's so true. The cost incurred ended up being so much more because I waited", "It's not perfect, we have doctor shortage but it motivates me to pay my taxes.

Without the health insurance from my dad being in the military, my life saving surgery, 28 days in the hospital and all the associated stuff would have cost my parents 2  million dollars and  that was 20 years ago. I can't imagine how much that would cost now. \nHealthcare state side is just ridiculous.", "I pay 269$ every paycheck (every two weeks) for my family\u2019s (myself, spouse, children) health insurance through my job and I STILL can\u2019t afford to go to the doctor every time I should. \nI wouldn\u2019t mind paying this much for health insurance I could afford to use, but this is ridiculous the only thing it\u2019s good for is if something catastrophic happens. In that case it MAY prevent you from having to declare bankruptcy. For instance when my daughter was in the NICU for 7 days my insurance covered 100,000$, but we were still left with an 18,000$ bill.\nSomething HAS to change here- there\u2019s too much wealth in this country for those of us that are stuck living paycheck to paycheck to be terrified of doctor visits due to finances. And my wife and I both have jobs in which we make 28$ an hour- God help those who are struggling to make less.\n\nAgain, I am more than happy to pay what I\u2019m paying now if it means I can actually afford to go to the doctor, but in order for that to happen this corrupt ass insurance companies are going to have to be forced to deal with us in good faith, and the only way I can see that happening (what with their executives insatiable greed) is to have our government socialize medicine and negotiate rates for us so that as a country we will be a single buyer. The companies who don\u2019t want to get with the program and file injunctions or sue to stop such a system need to be cut out of our society like a tumor and those who are willing to play ball will still make plenty of money- just not enough for the CEO to make billionaire status.

Discovered it after being in a hospital bed waiting on signed orders for nutrition and only had IV fluids for 12 hours. Painful but valuable lesson. Gastropareisis is a daily struggle, some days he remembers dreaming and being afraid to wake up not knowing if it will be a good or bad day. \n\nI hope you find relief, thank you for the kind words", "Oh thank you so much, it's hard to see the struggles he has sometimes and not feel guilty but you are right.
