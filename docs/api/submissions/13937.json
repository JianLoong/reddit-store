My son (11m) is autistic and his dad isn\u2019t in the picture. \n\nThe last time they came over everything kicked off. Her son laughed and called my son fatherless as a tease, my son came running to me crying and telling me how he mocked him about his \u2018daddy not loving him enough to stay\u2019. I also noticed some marks on his arms. \n\nThis was directly after my sister saying her husband was in legal difficulty.  I scolded her son and called him a bully, causing her to get upset and defensive of her son saying he has done nothing wrong. I then said, \u2018like (husband\u2019s name) did nothing wrong\u2019. She started defending him and I told her that he deserves the punishment he will get and I hoped he\u2019d go to prison for justice of his crimes, that he was the one that broke the law and just because she cares about someone doesn\u2019t mean they are a saint who can do no wrong.\n\nShe got angry and left, I don\u2019t really know if I\u2019ve been wrong or given her the reality. check she needs.\n\nI mean, her son is a bully, she\u2019s had multiple complaints about his bullying from the school but she does nothing. All her kids are brats that have had multiple complaints and troubles with the school. Neither her nor her husband are good parents. Her daughters are both rude, especially her eldest, and her son steals her and his fathers cigarettes, vapes and she allows him to drink alcohol.
