He made you feel like shit. He attacked your self-esteem directly. In the moment when you were at your most vulnerable, you made an audible.\n\nGuess what? He lost your trust. And he isn't doing shit to regain. It's time for him to shut up and focus on just being a good dad and spouse, not getting all butt hurt, because he faced consequences of his actions.", "Sounds like you and your husband have a strange dynamic that may benefit from some counseling.", "NTA - Ignore all these YTA comments, they\u2019re probably from men who have shamed their pregnant partner\u2019s appearance \u201cas a joke\u201d then wonder why she doesn\u2019t act affectionate towards them anymore. He made you feel uncomfortable by saying it\u2019d be nasty seeing you birth his child, he might have tried to play it off as a joke but how would you not feel horrible at that comment? He\u2019s trying to shift blame and play victim now because you stood your ground (good on you btw!) but explain to him you felt betrayed when you were body shamed by the very man who caused your pregnancy. He wants to be a team yet he\u2019s acting like sore loser.", "NTA I would never be able to get what he said out of my head. I would hear it the entire time and for months after. He should never had said that, it was incredibly hurtful, ignorant, and callous.", " ESH. Honestly sounds like your marriage is fucked", "YTA. The fact that you even include the context of the joke shows that its the reason you chose your brother over him. Clearly you are not over the joke, even if you \"forgive him for it\" its clearly left you feeling some negative things (worries, doubts, resentments). That would be fine..... if you were COMMUNICATIVE with your husband about them, but instead you deny him the joy of watching your child being born LAST SECOND!?!? Don't tell him you've accepted his apology and acknowledge he was making a (poor taste) joke, and then act like you haven't done either of those things.  If your relationship and husband are any good he won't see you as nasty even if you shit yourself during labor. If he would, you chose the wrong guy to have a kid with, but instead you'll never know and he's going to resent you for this for a long, long time (I know I would).\n\nI am not defending the joke at all, but I am calling out you being two-faced and denying your husband a very very important moment in his life because of a joke you apparently \"forgave\" him for. Again you have every right to be upset with your husband, but you pretending you're not for MONTHS and then doing this makes you the AH.", "YTA. Was your husband's comment rude? Absolutely. You deprived him of a once in a lifetime opportunity to witness the birth of his child for it. I wouldn't be surprised if he divorced you over this. And honestly? I couldn't say I'd blame him if he did. Dick move OP.", "YTA yes your husbands joke was definitely out of line but now he missed seeing his son born.

My bf and I have a 5 month old", "YTA\n\nDid he make a bad tasteless joke yep but you said it was months before and he has been great ever since.

But you SAID you did and you also indicated he has been loving and on the up-and-up since.\n\nYou're entitled to have whoever you want by your side giving birth but you communicated poorly and then sprung it on your husband literally last minute, even what seems like low key texting your brother to come.\n\nYou created a huge problem in your marriage by pulling this over your husband.

The fact that you trust your brother more than your husband is odd...and troubling but you didn't ask for a judgment on that.", "Huge YTA. You told the father of your child to wait outside? And invited your brother? Weird as shit and terrible wife. Sorry but dads are important and robbed him of a special moment in his and child\u2019s life. Over a dumb comment. Granted stupid comment but \u2026missed the birth of his child?! YTA", "Yta. You purposefully waited until you were being wheeled into the delivery room to tell him. I would never forgive you. Hope you and your brother have a great time raising the kid.", "I'm sorry (actually I'm not sorry) but YTA. You can spin the story any way you want to try to justify what you did but the end result is the same to me. Your husband made a \"joke\" MONTHS before your son was born. He apologized for it. You claim that you forgave him. However it's clear as day that you didn't. You sat around and stewed on it for months! You even said that he had been loving ever since he made the bad joke. You said he assumed he'd be in the room with you...well yeah because you nodded along! It's also clear to me that your brother had to have known he'd be in the room with you beforehand. How else was he able to drop his life and rush to your side? You had months, weeks, days and hours to tell your husband that you didn't want him in the room. But you didn't. I've given birth twice and was in labor for over 12 hours with one and I couldn't imagine watching my husband practically beg me to be by my side. Because that's what it sounds like your husband was doing when he asked you not to do this to him. He knew something you didn't. He knew it was a moment you could never give back to him. Doesn't matter how many other kids you have together (which you'd be lucky if y'all did imo) he's never going to forget how he wanted to be there and you didn't let him. He may have to live with a joke he made in poor taste but you may have to live without your husband. I hope it was worth it \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udfff\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "YTA\n\nYou accepted the apology and agreed. Then you changed your mind last minute. Your brother even held him before your husband. \n\nThat\u2019s amazingly cruel, like I don\u2019t know if you are some genius mastermind or what, but you really went for the jugular and you won.", "YTA. Shame on you", "YTA.\n\nBeing there for the birth of all three of my children is a magical moment in my life.\n\nYour husband is also an asshole for saying mean things about the last birth.\n\nAt least should have told him ahead of time. So he could prepare for it.", "INFO: So do you plan on having more children with your husband? And if so, will you choose your brother over your husband in the future too?\n\nBecause his joke was months ago. If you\u2019re still bothered by it now, I don\u2019t see that changing moving forward.\n\nIf you don\u2019t ever intend on letting your husband come before your brother, maybe you should tell him that now.", "NAH people in the comments need to understand what childbirth is like. You're about to do one of the hardest things a human can do, it's terrifying and dangerous and whatever you need to get through that, you f**kin do it. \n\nIt sucks that it was a last minute change so of course your husband is going to be hurt but you are not just some vessel for his offspring. This experience is not for his entertainment. Your a living breathing woman who needed your brother in that moment. Your needs outweigh his in that moment. \n\nIf you needed an emergency C-section under anesthesia, he wouldn't have seen his child born and no one would be blaming you because they'd understand that your needs outweighed his ..why does a woman have to be in a life-or-death scenario before their needs take precedence?", "You didn\u2019t really accept his apology if you held it against him later.  Make sure when you accept an apology your done with the topic.  You should have told your husband BEFORE going back.  Like as soon as you thought about asking your brother.  I get why your husband is hurt.  Still NAH I don\u2019t think you did it maliciously but you need to communicate better with your husband so he knows how to comfort you.", "NTA. Well, if he feels betrayed, he shouldn't have said that the birthing process is nasty and you'd be unattractive to him. He is reaping what he sows. He was the one who made you insecure in the most vulnerable moment of your life, how is he surprised you chose a person you are secure with?", "INFO - Did your brother hold your son before your husband did?", "Look, I'm pregnant right now. My husband and I have loosely discussed him being in the room or not. He also thinks it would be gross to watch... because it IS gross to watch. Have you watched a live birth from that end?! It's disgusting. There is blood, amniotic fluid, poop, sweat... it is gross. As of right now, my husband doesn't plan to be in the room so I'll have my mom there. But if its even down to the last second and my husband wants to come in, he will be the one in the room. IT IS HIS CHILD TOO. Fathers are also overwhelmed with emotions, and a first time father doesn't know any more of what he wants or what's going on or what to expect than a first time mother. \n\nHonest to goodness, I would never forgive you if I was your husband. You unilaterally took away the once in a lifetime opportunity of seeing his first child be born.", "ESH: His comment was obviously insensitive and wrong, but you realize that you also have kind of nuked your marriage? Unless his comments follow a pattern of behavior, this was a one off incident. Denying him the privilege of being in the room, which is in your rights, is going to have consequences though.", "ESH - Your partner dug his grave by making a \"joke\" about something that is a highly stressful, painful and vulnerable to be in.\nIt makes sense that you wouldn't feel comfortable to have him in the room at the same time about something you feel so vulnerable about.\n\nHowever, you've also kept him away from the birth of what I assume is his first child. What can be a magical experience for parents. This is bound to create resentment between the two of you.\n\nWhatever happens the two of you need to communicate about your feelings and deal with any resentment before it builds any further.", "I\u2019m sorry but YTA. You said everything was fine and you talked it out then waited at the very last minute when he was in the hospital to tell him some, you want your brother instead. His feelings aren\u2019t something that\u2019s just gonna go away and no matter how many people on Reddit pretends a new mom can do no wrong is going to change that. He is telling you he doesn\u2019t feel like you are a team, he wants to do more, and he wants you to rest. It seems you have a communication problem with your husband and that\u2019s not gonna end well.", "ESH\n\nSomething like this could severely impact your relationship.  He was a dick for making those comments, but maybe there was a way to have both your brother and husband there", "ESH. Obvi your husband sucks. But you suck for \u201cnodding along\u201d and waiting until the last minute to tell him you didn\u2019t want him there. If you can\u2019t talk things out beforehand your marriage is in trouble.", "ESH. Com hat he said to you was really bad. Even if it was a joke it wasn\u2019t funny. You waited until the very last minute to tell him you didn\u2019t want him there. You should have communicated with him before you went into labor. You both are at fault here.", "ESH. \n\nI completely understand wanting to have someone in the room you want comforting you. But if he apologized and you accepted it then that\u2019s crappy. You were never honest about your intentions to have a different support person there for the birth and that sucks too given that it is his child. \nI\u2019ve had a baby, and I get how vulnerable you are in  it and I\u2019d want to be comfortable with who I had there too, especially if they made prior comments. BUT i absolutely would have had that conversation with them given that for both parties it\u2019s a big life event.", "ESH What he said was honest but shouldn\u2019t have been said out loud, but he\u2019s the child\u2019s father. He should\u2019ve been allowed to see his baby be born regardless if he thought the process was nasty. He sounded like he honestly wanted to be apart of that process and you admitted that everything was fine after the apology so of course he would feel betrayed when you decided last minute he couldn\u2019t see his sons birth", "YTA!! Yeah he said something stupid. You proved your vindictiveness by screwing him out of being in there with you.", "YTA you took a huge moment away from him over a joke.", "YTA. A joke (bad or not) is no cause to deny a father being present to welcome his child into the world...that's a gift you can't replace. Yes, what he said was terribly insensitive, and as you say...apologized for and accepted. But you turned around and took away something you can't replace \nYTA!!!", "YTA\n\nThis isn\u2019t someone else\u2019s kid right? Like this is actually your husbands kid? Cause you said you would have him in the room just to switch. You even said yes as you were texting your bro\u2026so this is shady", "ESH, he made a dumb comment and you said you forgave him. Then he missed his child's birth. Get some counseling, you all need it.", "This is a hard one because as the pregnant woman, you deserve to be comfortable when giving birth.  However, the way that you handled this makes YTA.  \n\nYour husband said something stupid.  He apologized and changed his behavior to be more loving. You said that you accepted it, but still seemed to hold it over him. Also, you were afraid he would not be comforting, which I am guessing it due to past behavior.  Instead of talking this over with him and making your expectations clear for how he should behave in the delivery room, you cut him out and made him miss the birth of his child.", "YTA\n\n\u00ab\u00a0He was one of the first\u00a0\u00bb kind of implied your brother held your son before him? That is absolutely an asshole thing to do to him. \n\nI get it, he made a bad joke, likely sue to nervousness. But he was there. He was supportive. And you trew him outside. You withheld your son from him. And from the sound of it, you still don\u2019t allow him to be a father. I really, really hope you are not complaining about \u00ab\u00a0having to do everything\u00a0\u00bb. Your husband wants to be there for his son, and you are doing everything in your power to sabotage that.", "This is a repost from like less than an hour ago. Everyone then said YTA, not sure why you'd expect it to change this go around.", "YTA and this can never be undone.   It\u2019s something that the pain from can ruin a relationship.  Sorry to say but this was really not the right way to settle your anger.", "I really think that maybe the husband should have been there and I know he said some terrible things.  In the end, he lost that chance to see his child born.  I do not understand why both could not be in the room at once.  I had my husband (now my ex), my mother, his mother and a close friend in the room for my daughter's birth.  For son's birth had my mom and ex only.  \n\nSometimes people say things without thought and maybe for a while it seemed like something he did not want to see.  But when it came down to it, he changed heart and wanted to be part of something special and that was taken from him at the last moment.  \n\nIt does not help a marriage if you two can not communicate like you should.", "YTA for marrying him and having a baby with him. You choosed this. Sure he said something stupid but you lied when you said you forgave him and pulled a fast one on him when it was game time. We call that the oki doke.  Unpopular opinion but it's my honest one.", "You get to choose who you are comfortable with but your brother really?", "INFO - you said your husband was \u201cone of the first\u201d to hold his son. Who held him before your husband?", "ETA. It was a nasty joke, totally inexcusable. But come on, you didn\u2019t warn him that you didn\u2019t want him in the delivery room? Give me a break. He\u2019ll never get that moment back.", "Maybe controversial but soft ESH\n\nYour husband- was immature and a total asshole for making you feel insecure and vulnerable like that.  It\u2019s great that he\u2019s since been wonderful and supportive, but a massive massive fuck up on his part in a time when you need extra care and reassurance. He shouldn\u2019t be surprised that you\u2019d feel uncomfortable after that (except that you seemed to accept his apology).\n\nBut to text your brother on the sly as a last minute switch out? It seems like neither of you are communicating well.  If you hadn\u2019t forgiven him and wanted your brother there instead, you had time to communicate this to your husband so he wasn\u2019t so blindsided, or so that he could have figured out a way to make amends and repair what was broken. Or he could have been in the OR but stayed away from full view of the birth.  I don\u2019t know that I could get over missing the birth of my first child, just as much as I might not be able to get over comments about my body, and if that was an outlying shitty choice and he\u2019s otherwise been good then it probably should have been something you let him come to terms with before he was excited to be in the delivery room.", "I'm in the middle of thinking you are YTA & NTA\n\nYes the comment he made wasn't funny and he shouldn't of said it but in your words he being very loving and by the sounds of it trying to make up for it.\n\nBut you made him stay outside and miss the most important day in his life and your husband should of been there.  It doesn't matter what was said, he missed seeing his son being born.  My husband made a comment that he didn't want to see anything down there and i said that's fine stay near my head and i would never tell him to get out because he was nervous about what happens & he not good with blood.

But you straight up lied to him the whole time, not communicating, then called a 'fake' audible that you were planning the whole time.", "YTA and so is your brother.

That's cold.", "NTA a birth is a huge medical ordeal, and it is just yours. It is extremely important and necessary for you to feel safe and cared for. The childs father does not have a right to be there when you are at your most exposed and vulnerable. He made you feel uncomfortable about his presence in the room, that is all on him.\n\nYou shouldn't worry about \"looking disgusting\" while giving birth, this is why the medical personell present do not anounce that you pooped, they wipe it away quietly and discreet.", "NTA the birthing person has every right to chose who they want at the birth. It is a very difficult thing to give birth and birthing petiole need support and autonomy. Your husband didn\u2019t make you feel comfortable in that scenario and this is the consequence. \n\nI would re-evaluate if this is a healthy relationship if you don\u2019t feel that you can trust your husband in this way but he doesn\u2019t get to dictate how you give birth even if he is the father.", "YTA.

I just made some popcorn for everyone.  When is the divorce party?", "YTA. So what he made a stupid comment. People have the right to change their minds. You ruined that day for him and that bonding with his son. \n\nAlso, having your brother in the room is completely gross. Assuming he didn\u2019t watch, how could he support you better than your spouse who is going to be supporting you through the next weeks, months and years?", "YTA. He made a joke that hurt your feelings. He apologized  And you told him you accepted his apology. How do you think he felt then to be kept out of the delivery room over a joke he said that you forgave him for?  He can never get that experience that you took away from him back.", "YTA 100%, this is a terrible thing you\u2019ve done.  \n\nIt\u2019s obviously birth isn\u2019t a pretty / good thing to witness ( fully appreciate much worse for the mother of course!) but it\u2019s something a father should go through, support their wife.  What he said could be out of nerves or a joke,  none of us know the context but it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s a nervous event to look forward too.\n\nHe did however step and want to be there when the event occurred, it\u2019s ok for a man to be nervous too (again much bigger event for the mother of course) but yes he wanted to support when the time came\n\nIt\u2019s a extremely special experience / moment in life!  Honestly you\u2019ve denied him that moment he as a father he should have experienced\n\nUnless he literally was a wet rag / hopeless fool then no it\u2019s terrible what you\u2019ve done, he did step up when the big day occurred as well / he wanted to support and be there", "NAH.

He was in the room and immediately felt so much love and admiration for his wife and child. None of his fears of it being gross came to pass bc the \u201cmiracle\u201d of birth takes over.

He apologised and you did accepted his apology. But then, you acted petty. He wanted to be there. Do you even know how many women would like to have the father with her at that moment?

Being in the room is about supporting your partner not getting to catch the baby as it comes out. Yes it's his child too and he's going to have a lot of emotions but the mothers needs come first!  \n\n In a hospital, half a dozen people could hold your baby before you (doctors, surgeons, midwives, nurses) the first time you do it is still the first time, it doesn't matter what order it comes. If that's what takes precedence over your partner going through one of the scariest and most painful moments of her life then you can wait outside.", "Shouldn't husband blame himself for what he said? For causing the doubt?", "I have delivered 2 babies, and I know how hard they can be (my second was extremely difficult because I ended up with an autoimmune disease and lost 85 lbs while pregnant and a bit after, I had 3 surgeries and a baby all within 1 year). But like your comment pointed out, it's hard on the father's too. I think we forget how hard things can be on our men. It's just different. They have to deal with us during all our hormones, they have sleepless nights too (or should, my husband was willing to help out with night feedings, but we did a bottle), and they hopefully pick up a lot of slack from when the woman is recovering and going through difficult bodily and mental changes. Having babies is just hard. \n\nNow, I don't think the husband should have made his \"joke\" but again, you're right. Labor and delivery is not pretty. The time after when you actually have the baby is the beautiful part. I wouldn't want to watch it, and I'm glad we have doctors and nurses who can stomach not only watching, but getting in there. Besides, he would have six weeks to get over his aversion since she wouldn't be able to have sex until then anyway. \n\nI kinda think OP is an AH for not communicating with her husband and letting such a stupid comment get to her on such a level. She took away something he can never get back and gave it to her brother. She was petty over something she could have fixed a while back. Husband can't be more comforting or helpful if you don't tell him what he can do better.", "But there is a huge difference between saying \"the process of childbirth is gross\" and \"YOU will be gross as you birth my child, it will change how I look at you, and I won't want to have sex with you afterwards.\" It is perfectly reasonable to think childbirth is disgusting, but to tell your pregnant wife that you'd find her disgusting because of it? That's messed up. I wouldn't feel safe or cared for around somebody who said that to me, whether or not I was even pregnant. I do think in an ideal situation OP should have communicated better in advance, but it's possible she didn't realize how much it was affecting her until the moment came to actually give birth. \n\nAnd as others have said: birth is not a spectator sport. Pregnancy, birth, all of that, it may be hard on the men/partners, too, but nowhere near as hard as it is on the person giving birth.", "This is just weird.

This is what\u2019s wrong with us women, we take to much emotional load and let men get away with being emotional unavailable.

It\u2019s omg no poop I can\u2019t handle this I\u2019m out. That ain\u2019t emotions of child birth. You need to check your marriage in stead of judging OP.

He just wanted to get to his son first.\n\nI'd hate to be in a situation where I'm that vulnerable with someone who wasn't really there for *me*, but viewed me as a means to an end.", "What is the special moment for him, out of interest? Being a support for his partner through what is likely the most difficult experience of her life so far? Or being with his son asap?", "I think the thing is, he was being honest. I believe he *does* think it's gross (as you do), and he *would* struggle to see her in a sexual way after. So why would he want that?\n\nI think we know why; because it's important to him to \"see his son born\". It's not important to him to *be a good and comforting birthing partner*. Those are different things. OP needed a partner not a spectator whose judgment might ruin her sex life indefinitely.", "Just saw your edit: that is crap and it seems like perhaps this is her \"revenge\" for feeling used by him. Like \"you couldn't love me fully when I really needed it, so now this child won't love you\". That sucks and isn't fair to the child or the father. Or even herself as humans parent in pairs for a reason!", "Well, don\u2019t make one. I wouldn\u2019t want to see myself give birth but if I was pregnant and the man who impregnated me joked about how nasty it would be then it\u2019s a completely different story, that\u2019s downright disrespect. Not his body, he doesn\u2019t have to endure the birth so he needs to grow tf up and keep his comments about her pregnant body to himself. She\u2019s risking her life for him to make jokes. She didn\u2019t pretend, she\u2019s allowed to accept the apology yet not want him there, him apologising for saying horrible things isn\u2019t a guaranteed entry pass into the delivery suite. That moment **is** precious and I would want only supportive, kind natured people around me to ensure I felt safe and cared for instead of some idiot who said how nasty it would be to see my life at risk. It\u2019s a moment he won\u2019t get back because he got himself kicked out, maybe next time when someone is having a child for him he\u2019ll learn to be a little more sensitive and keep his mouth shut. He\u2019s a grown man, if you\u2019re old enough to impregnate a woman then you should be old enough to have some sense about how to act around them. It\u2019s a stressful, vulnerable and dangerous time for women and they already feel unattractive enough to their partners while pregnant, for a man to turn around and \u201cjoke\u201d during this time is just gross on his part. He might be resentful but he caused this, he has no one to blame but himself.", "That's why I chose NAH.

I was telling her how I was surprised that I had had kids before she did because when we were younger I always said I did not want kids and she said she wanted a lot of kids. I have 3 now, and she has 0. She still wants a bunch of kids, but she wants to adopt now. I asked her why. She told me about this (husband stitch). My sister is definitely a man hater so I thought she was lying. It is very sad to know she was not. This makes me understand why she hates men somewhat. I understand there are men out there who are amazing and would never think about doing something so heinous, like my husband, my father-in-law, or literally any guy I've ever associated with. It is sad to think about the kind of \"men\" she must have met that made her 1.) hate men and 2.) even know this was a thing.

He needs to go back to Leave it to Beaver where he belongs.", "Because he works? And she\u2019s home all day. That\u2019s delusional. I stayed home with my son while husband went to work and of course I spent more time with him and taking care of him.", "That\u2019s fine, but grown men should know how to speak sensitively to their pregnant partners and not call them \u201cnasty\u201d. I probably wouldn\u2019t want to see either, but to carry a child for someone and have them turn around and use the word nasty when speaking about the birth process that she has to endure is just plain horrible.
