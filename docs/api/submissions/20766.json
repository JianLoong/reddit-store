You need to ask permission from the parents before doing anything with their kid. He\u2019s not your son, and your feelings of entitlement over him should make his parents seriously reconsider whether you are a safe and responsible option to be on the approved pick-up list. \n\nRegarding the suggested affair, there are a multitude of things that could be more important than answering your texts. She could be working, napping, cleaning the house, doing yard work, etc. She could simply be relaxing with her phone on Do Not Disturb for everyone except emergency contacts, not expecting her weird in-law to text her that he\u2019s just going to take her son because that\u2019s not a reasonable expectation.

His parents are the ones who decide if he goes for ice cream or not. You didn't \"have a right to take him.\" And your attitude that you're somehow more \"responsible\" because you check your text message is not helpful - strike three.\n\nThat said, your SIL sucks for not checking her text messages.

Never pick up your nephew again, though. They can do it every time.", "NTA, so you are given permission by the parents to pick their child up from camp. So you have permission to pick him up at anytime. \nI bet what happened is that the dad freaked out at the camp and yelled at the staff. Then found out the staff did their jobs properly and you had their kid. So they are mad at you because he looked like a fool. I know from working in childcare, if you didn't have permission and the staff doesn't recognize you, the child won't be released to that adult. So parents need to understand that giving you permission to pick that child up from camp doesn't mean the staff goes into the back and calls to confirm that is ok.

Put the shoe on the other foot, say your battery had died but is not important because you were on your way to pick up your son. You had to go to the toilet and took a couple extra minutes than usual but no biggie just a couple minutes and you're en route to pick up your son, and when you get there, your son is nowhere to be found, you had a text message of your brother oh hey I'm taking nephew but since your phone is dead and your charger is not with you, YOU CAN'T KNOW. Scary isn't it? If you wanted to get some ice cream for your nephew you CALL their parents, you make sure they're in agreement, if not you say how about this, we'll wait here for your mom or dad to pick you up and then we'll ask them to go get ice cream together. Those would have been appropriate solutions. He may be LIKE YOUR SON but\n#HE'S NOT YOUR SON\n\nNext time CALL, make sure you actually get an answer.

My friend's mother sent my mom a text saying \"taking your daughter for ice cream and movie night at my place!\" My mom's phone just happened to break that same day and when she showed to pick me up and I was nowhere to be found, the ENTIRE school everyone that was there as an adult was searching for me while any students left on campus were put on lockdown inside. I was kidnapped by my friends family and it's no different than what you did. \n\n You kidnapped your nephew - Period. End of story - so what if she \"should have read your text\" do you not comprehend how unreliable texting is as a form of communication? What if she had been injured and hospitalized? What if she broke her phone? What if a million other completely valid reasons she could not check her text and it is none of your business what that reason is! You are lucky you didn't have the police called and your nephew reported as a missing child!! If mom was injured or unable to inform dad in the timely manner she apparently did of where their child was he 100% would have done so. \nI didn't know any better just as your nephew didn't know any better but YOU know better or at least should.

They may have to rethink the amount of interaction they as a family are going to have with you from now on.", "YTA.

This is the same thing. \n\nYou\u2019re right, this could have been solved with adult communication.

The camp has permission to release the kid to him if necessary. He doesn't have permission from the parents to take the kid whenever.

Likewise, you might give a trusted adult permission to pick up in case of emergencies, but you'd still expect those arrangements to be made and communicated in advance. It's not a blank cheque, neither the spare key or permission to pick up transfers any rights, both the parents and homeowners retain their authority over the who, whats, whens and whys.\n\nMistakes happen, people can learn how to better negotiate these situations in future, but after the chaos and worry this caused - the lack of comprehension and remorse from the uncle is worrying. It's not like the usually hand off pick ups - or there's pre-existing expectations - the boys are usually picked up by their respective parents at different times.\n\nOP disrupted their routine on a whim and didn't do enough to confirm he had permission, he's also completely dismissed the parents subsequent concerns and requests. If he wants to be a trusted adult for this child and their parents - he needs to act like it and address both his entitlement and his lack of respect for the wishes of the child's actual parents.\n\nCan't imagine how panicked they must have been, he's right that they have bigger problems than an ice cream cone though - they've got an uncle behaving very inappropriately to deal with.\n\nYTA - but it'd be easy enough to apologize and promise to respect / wait for consent in future.

The expectation was that we walked ourselves to this lesson.  I would've been 12 and he 10 so we were not that young and this was nearly 40 years ago when it was actually very safe to do this. Well for some strange reason my aunt happened to be at the piano teachers house (I think she may have have been paying my cousin's bill) and it was complete coincidence.  But afterwards she went to my mothers house to drop something off... note... this was after she had seen as as I remember saying hi to her.\n\nWhen me and my brother got home about 40 minutes later, my mother was frantic because we had just both disappeared.... she'd forgotten about the lesson she'd organised.

It could've been a doctors appt where she was worried she might get bad news, or was with a parent who was about to get bad news or was seeing a therapist.  That might be why her husband didn't ring her to ask where the kid was because he knew there were other things happening and knew not to disturb her.

The point is so the parents and school both know the child will only be going home with pre-approved pickup people for the child\u2019s safety.

I've worked in summer camps as a director for about 10 years. If you put an adult on the pick up list, we will check their IDs to ensure they are on the list and then release the child to that adult.\n\nYou, the parent, put that adult on that list. Now it is your responsibility to talk to that adult and limit when they can pick up your child. If you want, we could put a giant red mark on your file that says \"no one but parents are allowed to pick up child(ren) unless called ahead of time\" and we will do  what you ask us to do. But if you don't set boundaries with the adult, and don't communicate with the staff, the staff will look at the pick up sheet, check their ID,  go \"yeah sure you can take him\". Then you sign him out with your name. That way if parent comes and goes \"hey were is my kid?\" we can look at the sign out form and say \"oh bill xxxxx picked him up at 4:30\"", "Emergency contact and pick up list are two different things.\n\nEmergency contact is if the kid gets sick, we go through the list, in order from 1-whatever to get in contact with an adult to get in touch with them to tell them what is needed.\n\nPick up list, in terms of after school programs, summer camps, give permission for anyone on that list to pick up the child. When you put their name on that list, and they come to pick up your kid, we check their IDs, we check the list. If the name and address matches, we let them go with that adult. Why? Because the parent signed this form explicitly stating this adult is allowed to pick up the child. \n\nThe communication here between OP and his SIL is shitty. She should have answered his text. When SIL didn't answer, he should have texted his brother. And his entire behavior surrounding everything else makes him a HUGE AH.  But by putting him on the pick up list, they did give him permission to pick up the child from the camp. \n\nThe fact that some comments are calling it kidnapping is insane. If you don't want them to pick up your kid, don't put them on the list. It is as simple as that.", "I agree.
