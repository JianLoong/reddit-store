There are many perfectly good reasons they might feel like that, and even if you and I wouldn't agree that whatever their reason is, is any good, wanting your child to remain in the hands of safe and approved caregivers instead of going for ice cream is nowhere near dangerous enough parenting for someone else to second-guess your decisions. \n\nThe one and only questionable thing you have described them doing is adding you to the approved pickup list, and I'm pretty sure they are reconsidering that even now.", "YTA.

The approved pick-up list is meant for emergencies or pre-arranged situations when the parents are unable to pick up their child. You need to ask permission from the parents before doing anything with their kid. He\u2019s not your son, and your feelings of entitlement over him should make his parents seriously reconsider whether you are a safe and responsible option to be on the approved pick-up list. \n\nRegarding the suggested affair, there are a multitude of things that could be more important than answering your texts. She could be working, napping, cleaning the house, doing yard work, etc. She could simply be relaxing with her phone on Do Not Disturb for everyone except emergency contacts, not expecting her weird in-law to text her that he\u2019s just going to take her son because that\u2019s not a reasonable expectation.

His parents are the ones who decide if he goes for ice cream or not. You didn't \"have a right to take him.\" And your attitude that you're somehow more \"responsible\" because you check your text message is not helpful - strike three.\n\nThat said, your SIL sucks for not checking her text messages.

Never pick up your nephew again, though. They can do it every time.", "NTA, so you are given permission by the parents to pick their child up from camp. So you have permission to pick him up at anytime. \nI bet what happened is that the dad freaked out at the camp and yelled at the staff. Then found out the staff did their jobs properly and you had their kid. So they are mad at you because he looked like a fool. I know from working in childcare, if you didn't have permission and the staff doesn't recognize you, the child won't be released to that adult. So parents need to understand that giving you permission to pick that child up from camp doesn't mean the staff goes into the back and calls to confirm that is ok.

Put the shoe on the other foot, say your battery had died but is not important because you were on your way to pick up your son. You had to go to the toilet and took a couple extra minutes than usual but no biggie just a couple minutes and you're en route to pick up your son, and when you get there, your son is nowhere to be found, you had a text message of your brother oh hey I'm taking nephew but since your phone is dead and your charger is not with you, YOU CAN'T KNOW. Scary isn't it? If you wanted to get some ice cream for your nephew you CALL their parents, you make sure they're in agreement, if not you say how about this, we'll wait here for your mom or dad to pick you up and then we'll ask them to go get ice cream together. Those would have been appropriate solutions. He may be LIKE YOUR SON but\n#HE'S NOT YOUR SON\n\nNext time CALL, make sure you actually get an answer.

Her mom was on the same okay to take home list for me. My friend's mother sent my mom a text saying \"taking your daughter for ice cream and movie night at my place!\" My mom's phone just happened to break that same day and when she showed to pick me up and I was nowhere to be found, the ENTIRE school everyone that was there as an adult was searching for me while any students left on campus were put on lockdown inside. I was kidnapped by my friends family and it's no different than what you did. \n\n You kidnapped your nephew - Period. End of story - so what if she \"should have read your text\" do you not comprehend how unreliable texting is as a form of communication? What if she had been injured and hospitalized? What if she broke her phone? What if a million other completely valid reasons she could not check her text and it is none of your business what that reason is! You are lucky you didn't have the police called and your nephew reported as a missing child!! If mom was injured or unable to inform dad in the timely manner she apparently did of where their child was he 100% would have done so. \nI didn't know any better just as your nephew didn't know any better but YOU know better or at least should.

They may have to rethink the amount of interaction they as a family are going to have with you from now on.", "YTA.

This is the same thing. \n\nYou\u2019re right, this could have been solved with adult communication.

The camp has permission to release the kid to him if necessary. He doesn't have permission from the parents to take the kid whenever.

Likewise, you might give a trusted adult permission to pick up in case of emergencies, but you'd still expect those arrangements to be made and communicated in advance. It's not a blank cheque, neither the spare key or permission to pick up transfers any rights, both the parents and homeowners retain their authority over the who, whats, whens and whys.\n\nMistakes happen, people can learn how to better negotiate these situations in future, but after the chaos and worry this caused - the lack of comprehension and remorse from the uncle is worrying. It's not like the usually hand off pick ups - or there's pre-existing expectations - the boys are usually picked up by their respective parents at different times.\n\nOP disrupted their routine on a whim and didn't do enough to confirm he had permission, he's also completely dismissed the parents subsequent concerns and requests. If he wants to be a trusted adult for this child and their parents - he needs to act like it and address both his entitlement and his lack of respect for the wishes of the child's actual parents.\n\nCan't imagine how panicked they must have been, he's right that they have bigger problems than an ice cream cone though - they've got an uncle behaving very inappropriately to deal with.\n\nYTA - but it'd be easy enough to apologize and promise to respect / wait for consent in future.

The expectation was that we walked ourselves to this lesson.  I would've been 12 and he 10 so we were not that young and this was nearly 40 years ago when it was actually very safe to do this. Well for some strange reason my aunt happened to be at the piano teachers house (I think she may have have been paying my cousin's bill) and it was complete coincidence.  But afterwards she went to my mothers house to drop something off... note... this was after she had seen as as I remember saying hi to her.\n\nWhen me and my brother got home about 40 minutes later, my mother was frantic because we had just both disappeared.... she'd forgotten about the lesson she'd organised.

If it was your SIL then when she realised her son wasn't there she'd have seen your message but your BIL had no idea and it wasn't up to your SIL to say anything because she never saw your message.  \n\nYou don't know where your SIL was.  It could've been a doctors appt where she was worried she might get bad news, or was with a parent who was about to get bad news or was seeing a therapist.  That might be why her husband didn't ring her to ask where the kid was because he knew there were other things happening and knew not to disturb her.  Because if he rang her and she picked up the phone she would've seen your message.\n\nThe two boys are not brothers.  Your nephew is not your child and you have no right to just take him.\n\nThere's a big apology needed to be made and it's going to take a long time to trust you again... if ever.

We were on a gated college campus.  Skip to shutdown of the campus and every car out for the next 30 minutes being vehicle searched by campus police, who by every measure I could see were the real pew pew police.  But also the real surrounding community police who were given a description of dad and daughter and were doing a visual search of the surrounding area.  Finally got in touch with the mom who was beyond pissed but said it was cool that dad was with daughter.  Cool in the sense that it was not a kidnapping but not cool without her knowledge or consent.  Mom got in touch with the dad and presumably chewed his ass out who then made a beeline back to campus completely freaked out by the commotion with a super embarrassed daughter.  Heard something to the affect of, it's this kind of shit why.  That was one freaky day.  Rule was changed so that staff had physical custody of child until exchange was made.
