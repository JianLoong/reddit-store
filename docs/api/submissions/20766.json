The approved pick-up list is meant for emergencies or pre-arranged situations when the parents are unable to pick up their child. You need to ask permission from the parents before doing anything with their kid. He\u2019s not your son, and your feelings of entitlement over him should make his parents seriously reconsider whether you are a safe and responsible option to be on the approved pick-up list. \n\nRegarding the suggested affair, there are a multitude of things that could be more important than answering your texts. She could be working, napping, cleaning the house, doing yard work, etc. She could simply be relaxing with her phone on Do Not Disturb for everyone except emergency contacts, not expecting her weird in-law to text her that he\u2019s just going to take her son because that\u2019s not a reasonable expectation.

His parents are the ones who decide if he goes for ice cream or not. You didn't \"have a right to take him.\" And your attitude that you're somehow more \"responsible\" because you check your text message is not helpful - strike three.\n\nThat said, your SIL sucks for not checking her text messages.

Never pick up your nephew again, though. They can do it every time.", "NTA, so you are given permission by the parents to pick their child up from camp. So you have permission to pick him up at anytime. \nI bet what happened is that the dad freaked out at the camp and yelled at the staff. Then found out the staff did their jobs properly and you had their kid. So they are mad at you because he looked like a fool. I know from working in childcare, if you didn't have permission and the staff doesn't recognize you, the child won't be released to that adult. So parents need to understand that giving you permission to pick that child up from camp doesn't mean the staff goes into the back and calls to confirm that is ok.

Put the shoe on the other foot, say your battery had died but is not important because you were on your way to pick up your son. You had to go to the toilet and took a couple extra minutes than usual but no biggie just a couple minutes and you're en route to pick up your son, and when you get there, your son is nowhere to be found, you had a text message of your brother oh hey I'm taking nephew but since your phone is dead and your charger is not with you, YOU CAN'T KNOW. Scary isn't it? If you wanted to get some ice cream for your nephew you CALL their parents, you make sure they're in agreement, if not you say how about this, we'll wait here for your mom or dad to pick you up and then we'll ask them to go get ice cream together. Those would have been appropriate solutions. He may be LIKE YOUR SON but\n#HE'S NOT YOUR SON\n\nNext time CALL, make sure you actually get an answer.

Her mom was on the same okay to take home list for me. My friend's mother sent my mom a text saying \"taking your daughter for ice cream and movie night at my place!\" My mom's phone just happened to break that same day and when she showed to pick me up and I was nowhere to be found, the ENTIRE school everyone that was there as an adult was searching for me while any students left on campus were put on lockdown inside. I was kidnapped by my friends family and it's no different than what you did. \n\n You kidnapped your nephew - Period. End of story - so what if she \"should have read your text\" do you not comprehend how unreliable texting is as a form of communication? What if she had been injured and hospitalized? What if she broke her phone? What if a million other completely valid reasons she could not check her text and it is none of your business what that reason is! You are lucky you didn't have the police called and your nephew reported as a missing child!! If mom was injured or unable to inform dad in the timely manner she apparently did of where their child was he 100% would have done so. \nI didn't know any better just as your nephew didn't know any better but YOU know better or at least should.

They may have to rethink the amount of interaction they as a family are going to have with you from now on.", "YTA.

You sound entitled AF.", "You should have called them OP.  It does not matter if you're on the pick up list. You should have actually called them personally and get a verbal consent from the parents, letting them know your plans. If you couldn't reach them by phone call, then just take your own kid. Don't just abuse the parents trust, putting you on the pickup list to do with what you like... You have no right to just pick up the child, whenever you feel like, what's wrong with you?

He still needed to get the parents permission. \n\nJust because you\u2019re on a child\u2019s emergency contact/pick up list at school doesn\u2019t mean you should just go get the kid without the parent\u2019s okay. This is the same thing. \n\nYou\u2019re right, this could have been solved with adult communication. When OP didn\u2019t get a response to his text, he needed to call the parents *like* *an* *adult* and get permission to take their child.", "WTF. The camp has permission to release the kid to him if necessary. He doesn't have permission from the parents to take the kid whenever. OP should have gotten affirmative consent before even thinking of this. What a stressful situation for the parents. I'd be livid, but my in-laws aren't this dumb and would have the courtesy and common sense to call.", "He may have proven himself unfit for that responsibility after this lol\n\nThe permission is so the camp knows who's safe for the child to be released to, their liability protection doesn't supercede the parent's custody.\n\nYou give people a spare key for emergencies, for example, if they wandered in without notice and started raiding your freezer for ice cream you might rethink if they're suitable. Likewise, you might give a trusted adult permission to pick up in case of emergencies, but you'd still expect those arrangements to be made and communicated in advance. It's not a blank cheque, neither the spare key or permission to pick up transfers any rights, both the parents and homeowners retain their authority over the who, whats, whens and whys.\n\nMistakes happen, people can learn how to better negotiate these situations in future, but after the chaos and worry this caused - the lack of comprehension and remorse from the uncle is worrying. It's not like the usually hand off pick ups - or there's pre-existing expectations - the boys are usually picked up by their respective parents at different times.\n\nOP disrupted their routine on a whim and didn't do enough to confirm he had permission, he's also completely dismissed the parents subsequent concerns and requests. If he wants to be a trusted adult for this child and their parents - he needs to act like it and address both his entitlement and his lack of respect for the wishes of the child's actual parents.\n\nCan't imagine how panicked they must have been, he's right that they have bigger problems than an ice cream cone though - they've got an uncle behaving very inappropriately to deal with.\n\nYTA - but it'd be easy enough to apologize and promise to respect / wait for consent in future. For the boys sake at least.", "Adult communication is getting an answer to your question before you make a decision", "That doesn't mean they can just walk off with the kid any fucking time they feel like it. If I was the parents their ass would be OFF the list and if they tried it again I'm pressing charges or at the very least they're picking their teeth up off the floor", "I can pick my niece and nephew up from daycare but I don\u2019t just randomly pop in and kidnap them \n\nIt\u2019s for emergencies or if they\u2019re sick and SIL is at work and can\u2019t get off. Not for random Ice cream dates without their mom knowing", "I understand that. The comment op was replying to was about being lactose intolerant. People are down voting him for him saying he knows his nephew like he is his son", "I understand why he is the AH in the situation, but people down voting him for having a relationship with his nephew, that's hilarious.", "Yeah. We have our former nanny and a family friend as backup pickup options for our kids because most schools/daycare require it and in case of emergency.\n\n\nIf either of them picked up my kid without us asking them to, I'd be calling the cops to report a kidnapping.\n\n\nIt's absolutely insane to pick up a kid who is not yours without the parent's permission.", "Because with the little amount of two comments OP is assuming nephew as property not as someone else's child. Yes they can know their nephew (I haven't seen OP's gender stated in the post) as much as they want, still not their right to take them as if it was an object that belongs to them \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", ">not their right to take them as if it was an object that belongs to them \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nI don't see anyone arguing otherwise \ud83e\udd37"]}
