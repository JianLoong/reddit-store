Not like she was force feeding them candy.", "NTA ... but....\n\nI'm betting this isn't about him not eating foods - I'm betting this is about the foods she can afford to feed him and the time she has to make food as a struggling single mom.\n\nIt's guilt and fear talking I'd bet and maybe sitting her down and really talking about how you love him and you want to do this for them and she's not imposing by having him hang out with you while she gets back on her feet. She may have to hear it several times. She may not even realize this is what it is...but that's my bet.  \n\n\nETA: just saw the age difference too - that kind of adds more weight to my assumption for me.", "NTA.

Does she cook for herself or eat junk as well?\n\nI can't help but notice that she had him when she was 17, so she has been in charge of feeding him since before most young adults figure out how to feed themselves without parental help.

I'll make you a bet... I can fix him a plate of some veggies.  If he complains, I'll apologize. If he willingly picks it up and eats it, then you acknowledge that no force feeding was involved or any of that other foolishness you accused me of and YOU apologize.  All I did is present the foods to him and he grabbed them and went to munching.", "NTA, similar to what others have said, I think she is lashing out because of a feeling of some sort of inadequacy. Does she know how to cook? Can she afford (money and time wise) making more healthy foods? Maybe what she is feeding him is all she knows, as her diet seems very similar, and considering how young she is, maybe she never really thought about how important healthy and balanced diet is. You seem like you care about both of them, so maybe sitting down with her and having a non-judgmental, open conversation with her about what are her struggles, if she is doing okay, what she would like to do going forward. Make it clear that you are asking because you care for her and her little one and want to do as much as you can for them to have the best life, not because you are judging her and think she's a bad mother. Maybe suggest you can make some meals for both of them, so she doesn't have to live of off fast food either. But that's just my over-nurturing self thinking, I know you might not have time for that, but if you do, maybe you can make a big difference for both of them.

You are doing what is best for him (after all, he can\u2019t protect himself and relies on adults to make the decisions) and his mother needs to stop making it all about her. \n\nIf she is depressed or she can\u2019t cook or she fears judgment, she can tell you - but she doesn\u2019t get to take it out on her kid and that is exactly what she\u2019s doing by trying to prevent you from feeding him a balanced diet.", "NTA. Trust me when I say no 4-year-old is going to eat something they don\u2019t want or like. They will let you know. You\u2019re being a lovely aunt, babysitting and feeding him dinner with no expectations. Her issue may not have anything to do with eating habits, but is probably some underlying resentment that she isn\u2019t willing to bring up. Or she\u2019s taking something else out on you. I\u2019m guessing her friends haven\u2019t heard the entire story but sister\u2019s version of it. I\u2019m also assuming her friends are around her age. That is YOUNG.

Having the time to cook can be very difficult for impoverished people. \n\nObviously this doesn\u2019t mean the mom is justified in feeding her kid poorly, but it means that oftentimes the time+money investment in buying fast food makes it cheaper than preparing food", "Not everyone, no. A five layer burrito from taco bell is usually too much food for me at one time. They're almost 4 dollars where I'm at, but they have the box that's five bucks and cones with a drink, the burrito, a taco, and chips. It's a duck ton of food for me for as buck more and I can make a second meal or of it.", "I\u2019ve got no leg in this discussion but a single beefy melt with a bottle of water is a perfectly filling dinner for me. Do I want more anyway? Absolutely. But am I actually still hungry? Nope.", "What a life you must have.  I guess Losers really do crawl out of everywhere on Reddit.", "She's 21 with a 4 year old. Do the math.", "Look up food deserts. I dont think that's what's happening in this scenario however it's a huge issue in the USA", "I've sampled over a dozen different brands, and all different types of peanut butters. \n\n\nThey all go in the cupboard, even the ones that say refrigerate after opening.\n\n\nSo far, they've all been perfectly fine.", "You have spent 1000 dollars a month on groceries?", "Damn fuck my stomach I\u2019m always hungry", "How is that not right? If you can't afford kids you're guaranteeing them a shitty life of struggling for no reason.", "Unlike you I\u2019m not a \u201closer\u201d that can\u2019t look after their kid, shitty parents are the biggest AH \u201closers\u201d", "Math has zero to do with it. There are good parents who started at 16 and shitty ones who started at 30.", "And your point? the fact she was 16/17 when got pregnant changes nothing about not having kid/s you can\u2019t appropriately look after, and that is MORE of a reason not to have had/kept the kid since she was still a kid herself", "I wasnt big on PB&J until I had tried it with natural, crunchy peanut butter. Having balance from the saltiness was much better than the overly sweet popular brands I had growing up", "wow\u2014i didn\u2019t even think of this. thank you so much for the perspective!", "If an American is on WIC to help them feed their children. That is taking care of their children. You dolts act like you don\u2019t almost live in kleptocracy with low paying jobs and no healthcare. \n\nBunch of tools acting like america is so great and somehow making what the shitty employers pay and not being able to afford food for your kids is the shameful thing. \n\nIdiots live. And always seem to reply to me. Loser.", "Where I am if you get pregnant abortion is illegal, sometimes having a child isn't a choice you make.", "You are a loser. Bet if I tracked you you live in a hillbilly hellscape have subpar education and a subpar job.  And a truck you can\u2019t afford. But somehow it makes you feel like an alpha loser to \ntry and shame people for feeding their kids. \n\nOh and I\u2019m Canadian and my kids are grown. And the whole world knows exactly what losers like you look like. \n\nBut at least your pea brain feels bigger for second eh bud?", "There\u2019s a ton of resources to make sure your kids don\u2019t eat garbage. I understand the pitfalls of poverty and how it can impact what food you eat, but it\u2019s no excuse to feed her child a diet of chips, cookies, candy, cereal, and Mac and cheese. I\u2019m sympathetic to her situation, but it\u2019s her responsibility as a parent to make sure her son is in good health. It doesn\u2019t have to be a perfectly nutritional meal plan even, but judging from this post she\u2019s putting literally zero effort into properly feeding her son. I\u2019ve known homeless people that have a more balanced diet than that.", "yaaaaasssss! Natural PB is the best.  I can't even eat the sugary stuff, its just gross lol.  A lot of the time peanut butter is eaten with sweet stuff already, like fruit or jam, no reason to make it sweeter!", "Clearly YOU are the subpar educated one if you think not feeding your kid appropriately is a good thing to do", "The main reason she feeds the child those things are because 1.  They are the easiest things to grab.  2.  Kids love them.  3.  She may not know how to cook.  And/Or 4.  It's what she likes to eat.  From the sounds of it, the kid is not obese which is good.  However...again...some education could be good here.  I know a lot of people think that kids can eat the same size birthday cake as an adult, that kids can have king sized candy bars, and they can't have multiple caffeinated drinks like an adult can a day.  Many parents don't look at the caloric intake for children and compare it to that of an adult.  They don't see that what they may ADD or hyperactive disorders could be triggered by all the caffeine/suar products the kids are consuming.  I'm sure this happens in non-poverity striken homes as well."]}
