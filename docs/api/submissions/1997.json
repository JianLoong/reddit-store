Not like she was force feeding them candy.", "NTA ... but....\n\nI'm betting this isn't about him not eating foods - I'm betting this is about the foods she can afford to feed him and the time she has to make food as a struggling single mom.\n\nIt's guilt and fear talking I'd bet and maybe sitting her down and really talking about how you love him and you want to do this for them and she's not imposing by having him hang out with you while she gets back on her feet. She may have to hear it several times. She may not even realize this is what it is...but that's my bet.  \n\n\nETA: just saw the age difference too - that kind of adds more weight to my assumption for me.", "NTA.

Does she cook for herself or eat junk as well?\n\nI can't help but notice that she had him when she was 17, so she has been in charge of feeding him since before most young adults figure out how to feed themselves without parental help.

I'll make you a bet... I can fix him a plate of some veggies.  If he complains, I'll apologize. If he willingly picks it up and eats it, then you acknowledge that no force feeding was involved or any of that other foolishness you accused me of and YOU apologize.  All I did is present the foods to him and he grabbed them and went to munching.", "NTA, similar to what others have said, I think she is lashing out because of a feeling of some sort of inadequacy. Does she know how to cook? Can she afford (money and time wise) making more healthy foods? Maybe what she is feeding him is all she knows, as her diet seems very similar, and considering how young she is, maybe she never really thought about how important healthy and balanced diet is. You seem like you care about both of them, so maybe sitting down with her and having a non-judgmental, open conversation with her about what are her struggles, if she is doing okay, what she would like to do going forward. Make it clear that you are asking because you care for her and her little one and want to do as much as you can for them to have the best life, not because you are judging her and think she's a bad mother. Maybe suggest you can make some meals for both of them, so she doesn't have to live of off fast food either. But that's just my over-nurturing self thinking, I know you might not have time for that, but if you do, maybe you can make a big difference for both of them.

Trust me when I say no 4-year-old is going to eat something they don\u2019t want or like. They will let you know. You\u2019re being a lovely aunt, babysitting and feeding him dinner with no expectations. Her issue may not have anything to do with eating habits, but is probably some underlying resentment that she isn\u2019t willing to bring up. Or she\u2019s taking something else out on you. I\u2019m guessing her friends haven\u2019t heard the entire story but sister\u2019s version of it. I\u2019m also assuming her friends are around her age. That is YOUNG.
