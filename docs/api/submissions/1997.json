Not like she was force feeding them candy.", "NTA ... but....\n\nI'm betting this isn't about him not eating foods - I'm betting this is about the foods she can afford to feed him and the time she has to make food as a struggling single mom.\n\nIt's guilt and fear talking I'd bet and maybe sitting her down and really talking about how you love him and you want to do this for them and she's not imposing by having him hang out with you while she gets back on her feet. She may have to hear it several times. She may not even realize this is what it is...but that's my bet.  \n\n\nETA: just saw the age difference too - that kind of adds more weight to my assumption for me.", "NTA.

Does she cook for herself or eat junk as well?\n\nI can't help but notice that she had him when she was 17, so she has been in charge of feeding him since before most young adults figure out how to feed themselves without parental help.

I'll make you a bet... I can fix him a plate of some veggies.  If he complains, I'll apologize. If he willingly picks it up and eats it, then you acknowledge that no force feeding was involved or any of that other foolishness you accused me of and YOU apologize.  All I did is present the foods to him and he grabbed them and went to munching.", "NTA, similar to what others have said, I think she is lashing out because of a feeling of some sort of inadequacy. Does she know how to cook? Can she afford (money and time wise) making more healthy foods? Maybe what she is feeding him is all she knows, as her diet seems very similar, and considering how young she is, maybe she never really thought about how important healthy and balanced diet is. You seem like you care about both of them, so maybe sitting down with her and having a non-judgmental, open conversation with her about what are her struggles, if she is doing okay, what she would like to do going forward. Make it clear that you are asking because you care for her and her little one and want to do as much as you can for them to have the best life, not because you are judging her and think she's a bad mother. Maybe suggest you can make some meals for both of them, so she doesn't have to live of off fast food either. But that's just my over-nurturing self thinking, I know you might not have time for that, but if you do, maybe you can make a big difference for both of them.

Trust me when I say no 4-year-old is going to eat something they don\u2019t want or like. They will let you know. You\u2019re being a lovely aunt, babysitting and feeding him dinner with no expectations. Her issue may not have anything to do with eating habits, but is probably some underlying resentment that she isn\u2019t willing to bring up. Or she\u2019s taking something else out on you. I\u2019m guessing her friends haven\u2019t heard the entire story but sister\u2019s version of it. I\u2019m also assuming her friends are around her age. That is YOUNG.

The very fact that I've had to exist on a pittance is why I know it's cheaper to buy basics and cook them yourself. Owing to where I'm from I've also spent my life surrounded by people who make poor decisions over and over and blame everything but themselves for their situations.", "[removed]", "Make some rice, spread canned pinto beans on top, add plenty of cheddar cheese. Can start with tortilla chips first if you want nachos. Microwave for 1.5 minutes. Easy peasy with beans being a protein. Can substitute black beans or refried beans for pintos.", "Apples are long lasting fruits that don\u2019t expire quickly and have nutrients, while cookies have no nutrients and wouldn\u2019t benefit a growing child. I\u2019m not sure where the cookies would really be the better option when they are roughly the same price. The same store shows also a 3lb bag of Fuji apples for $5 as well.", "I\u2019m not advocating to never purchase cookies or anything processed. I\u2019m lucky to be in a better position but I\u2019ve been a snap food recipient before. I just can\u2019t agree that means to ONLY eat processed foods. There\u2019s definitely ways to find healthy options for growing kids while trying to squeeze a dollar.", "I shop in Lidl. I buy basic cheap foods. I don't buy out of season or exotic fruits not native to my country unless they're super cheap like bananas. I buy meat on sale. I eat lots of tuna. \n\nYour entire concept of healthy foods is probably \"whole foods\" type bougie bullshit.\n\nNow tell me where I can find all these super cheap processed foods and give some examples.", "Great, I've lived out of my car for multiple years but only one of us is being a harsh, elitist judgmental know it all who can claims mental health is an illness but gives zero grace to someone who may be suffering.  \n\n\nAs I stated before, this is a 19yo single mom who had a kid at what...15? 14?  She was probably not taught any of the skills and has been just moving from one moment to the next to try to keep above water. But sure, I\"m positive she has the time, energy, resources to just put her kid down not go to work go take some classes on how to do all that.   \n\n\nShow some grace, dude.  \n\n\nChange your name or do better or both.", "It's not about the active input. It's the mental load. It's about having to juggle cooking rice, cooking beans, and whatever else along with wrangling a small child when you get home after 8 hours of minimum wage work - which is so much harder than a 9-5. People who are poor are burnt out, and the system is designed to keep them that way.", "Y\u2019all can still afford cheese ?! Our dairy products went up in price by 30%", "These people don't genuinely want help. They want to stuff their faces with sugar and have everyone tell them it isn't their fault.", "Literally the entire USA. It's great that your country has a more realistic view of food. People in the US, however, have to deal with cheap, unhealthy corn based food being heavily federally subsidized to the point that all other foods are more expensive. Then, 150 years of laws designed to keep black people subjugated also work to keep the poor, poor. The minimum wage hasn't risen in 14 years, while the cost of living has more than quadrupled. I'm glad your area has more economic mobility, but other places aren't so lucky.", "Oh wait are you in the States? I always forget this is world wide. I've never heard of Lindl. I shop at Aldi, Walmart, Hy-Vee, Jewel, La Cocina...", "[removed]", "I have to disagree here. I understand it takes some work, but there definitely are lits and lots of easy recipes out there, and making rice and beans (example given) really is not that difficult. There's so many foods you can make in bigger batches so that you can freeze it in portions, and later the only thing you have to do is heat it up in the microwave. It's something you have to want to learn, but it is worth it and it does save money. I've been cooking for myself since I was a teenager, lived on my own from a very young age with very little money and didn't have anyone teach me or anything. I know this shouldn't be so impossible.", "I work in construction, don't whine to me about how strenuous fucking *retail* is lmao. If I can move bricks and bags of cement and push wheelbarrows up ramps all day and go home and cook some food then so can a single mother who had to go through the horrible experience of *standing for an extended period.*", "People often underestimate how crazy tired some can get with blue collar work. My mom once fell asleep taking subway and kept going on the train back and forth until the closing time. \n\nThat night she wouldn\u2019t be soaking beans in anything. \ud83e\udd23", "UK, where we hear this exact same argument, and get the same bullshit \"comparisons\" where they cherry pick expensive healthy foods and go \"look how expensive it is to be healthy!!!11!!\". \n\nLidl and Aldi are basically the same thing.", "Jesus you're  TA of this whole freaking thread.  \n\n\nYou need to know how someone ends up there for years: They lose everything in the housing bubble, their entire industry goes under, they get cancer and go bankrupt and have no family bc they grew up without one and put themselves thru not just college but grad school too.  \n\n\nI now own a home, support others, volunteer, make good money and have a heart.  \n\n\nEveryone have a good day but this guy", "[removed]", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

I've worked pretty much all of them, none of them come close to wearing you out like construction.", "I've grocery shopped in Walmart when I was in Florida. This is like people who don't understand there is no cheating calories in vs calories out. You don't get to pretend you exist in some special place where the laws of economics don't apply. It cannot cost less to buy the same thing but with the added cost of labour. No company can operate like that. \n\nDo you think I live in fantasy land on unlimited money or something? I also have to live in the real world on a budget. That's why I know buying a bunch of frozen ready meals is much more expensive than buying a big bag of rice, a big bag of pasta, canned tomatoes, canned tuna, dried beans, veg and chicken and feeding yourself for weeks."]}
