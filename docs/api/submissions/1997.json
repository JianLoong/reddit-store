She\u2019s been trying to get a job and has picked up a few odd jobs (cleaning, babysitting) while she is gone I usually Baby sit my nephew. He just kind of hangs out with me or plays with his toys. I feed him dinner if she\u2019s been gone for awhile. When she is home all she feeds him is chips, cookies, candy, cereal, or Mac and cheese. That\u2019s it. She claims the cereal has all the vitamins and minerals he needs since she puts milk in it as well. Nephew is average in height and weight so he\u2019s not starving but it\u2019s not the healthiest lifestyle for him. She claims he won\u2019t eat anything else. \n\nWhile she\u2019s been gone in the evenings I\u2019ve been introducing new foods to him. He loves vegetables such as raw carrots, peas, green beans. He also really likes fruit. I\u2019ve been making him waffles, eggs, bacon, oatmeal and cream of wheat as well and he eats everything. He doesn\u2019t seem picky at all. \n\nShe came home last night and he was finishing up a grilled cheese with tomato soup and she flipped out on me. Told me that I shouldn\u2019t be feeding him things that he doesn\u2019t like and that I was force feeding him by not giving him a choice of what he wanted to be fed. \n\nI told her she was absolutely ridiculous and that he enjoyed new foods and that she was just to lazy to ever cook for him and used ready made meals. She blew up on me for calling her a \u201cbad mom\u201d she\u2019s constructed that I\u2019ve been force feeding her son while she\u2019s gone and told all her friends who have ganged up on me saying I was out of line and that I overstepped the boundary and I wasn\u2019t his mother. \n\nAITA here?", "created_utc": 1668116510, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yrsn7t/aita_for_giving_my_nephew_food_even_after_she/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is teaching him horrible eating habits. You are giving him the healthy meals he needs. You might want to talk to her about this when you two are getting along. Your nephew's pediatrician can also help her with nutrition and proper food. It also might be she can't afford the fresh food and so goes for the boxed, processed food.", "NTA.  It's not uncommon for kids to try more things when it's not mom or dad offering it.  So long as there are no allergy concerns OP did nothing wrong.  Not like she was force feeding them candy.", "NTA ... but....\n\nI'm betting this isn't about him not eating foods - I'm betting this is about the foods she can afford to feed him and the time she has to make food as a struggling single mom.\n\nIt's guilt and fear talking I'd bet and maybe sitting her down and really talking about how you love him and you want to do this for them and she's not imposing by having him hang out with you while she gets back on her feet. She may have to hear it several times. She may not even realize this is what it is...but that's my bet.  \n\n\nETA: just saw the age difference too - that kind of adds more weight to my assumption for me.", "NTA. Failing to provide a healthy and reasonable diet for a child is a form of neglect. This is legally considered to be abuse (where I live). Confront people who are ganging up on you with the fact that they are supporting child abuse.", "NTA, but your nephew is 4. He should be able to tell her himself what he does and doesn't like. It's weird that she won't feed him fruits and vegetables. They take almost no effort.", "NTA \n\nIt sounds like she has a limited diet herself and isn\u2019t even trying with her son.", "NTA, clearly. Poor kid. At 4 years old he can express what he likes and doesn't.", "NTA. Does she even understand how hard it is to force feed a 4 year old?", "NTA. She kinda is a bad mom if all she feeds is cookies and Mac n cheese. If she doesn\u2019t like you offering your nephew food she doesn\u2019t have to stay with you.", "NTA.  I think she has overstayed her welcome.", "NTA. You weren\u2019t serving him foods he is allergic to. Your sister sounds lazy. If a 4 year old eats something, it\u2019s because they like it unless you\u2019re literally stuffing it down their neck.", "NTA, but curious: What does your sister eat? Does she cook for herself or eat junk as well?\n\nI can't help but notice that she had him when she was 17, so she has been in charge of feeding him since before most young adults figure out how to feed themselves without parental help.  It sounds like she could probably benefit from some parenting classes, but you are  probably the last person she wants to hear that from right now.", "NTA. He\u2019s lucky to have you. But don\u2019t be judgmental with your sister. You can show her how to cook healthy things he likes without making her feel dumb or lazy.", "\"She claims the cereal has the vitamins he needs since it has milk in it.\"\n\nWhat the fuck? no, seriously? does your sister not know about the food guide?\n\nNTA OP. You're putting your nephew on the right path.", "She's 21 with a 4 year old. I'm guessing she's been judged a lot. \n\nYou could have been nicer about it, but if you're giving your nephew choices there's no harm. \n\nThere's also a phenomenon I know fairly well as an uncle with no children of my own - my nieces and nephews behave for me and act differently with me than they do their parents.", "NTA - if the shoe fits...\n\nShe's just upset that now she might actually have to make food for him.", "NTA- Let's start with... I agree with you. And then go to.. BUT.....you likely could have been more diplomatic.  To anyone giving you grief I would just say...sorry, but you weren't given an accurate narrative and unlike some, I'm not engaging with others about my sister, so, we're done here.  then mantra from there if they keep after you \"that's not what happened, good day\".  \n\nTo your sister I'd just say... you say he doesn't like it and I force feed him?  I'll make you a bet... I can fix him a plate of some veggies.  If he complains, I'll apologize. If he willingly picks it up and eats it, then you acknowledge that no force feeding was involved or any of that other foolishness you accused me of and YOU apologize.  All I did is present the foods to him and he grabbed them and went to munching.", "NTA, similar to what others have said, I think she is lashing out because of a feeling of some sort of inadequacy. Does she know how to cook? Can she afford (money and time wise) making more healthy foods? Maybe what she is feeding him is all she knows, as her diet seems very similar, and considering how young she is, maybe she never really thought about how important healthy and balanced diet is. You seem like you care about both of them, so maybe sitting down with her and having a non-judgmental, open conversation with her about what are her struggles, if she is doing okay, what she would like to do going forward. Make it clear that you are asking because you care for her and her little one and want to do as much as you can for them to have the best life, not because you are judging her and think she's a bad mother. Maybe suggest you can make some meals for both of them, so she doesn't have to live of off fast food either. But that's just my over-nurturing self thinking, I know you might not have time for that, but if you do, maybe you can make a big difference for both of them. Having dinner cooking sessions, or coming up with new dishes... Sorry for a long rambly post, I get too excited about cooking", "Nta", "Her: *sticks you with kid while shes gone all day*\n\nYou: *feeds said kid*\n\nHer: HOW DARE YOU FEED MY CHILD THINGS THAT HES HAPPILY ENJOYING YOU ABSOLUTE MONSTER!!!! *runs and snitches*\n\nEveryone: yeah it wasnt really right of you to keep her kid fed\n\nSo yeah... NTA... he clearly eats and enjoys the food so her argument is already invalid. Not too sure what she wants to accomplish by fighting with the person who is currently keeping a roof over her head. Even if he looks healthy, he wont stay that way for long if he keeps having only junk foods as his go to.\n\nSure you could argue its not your place, you arent his mom. But the kids still family to you, looking out for him and giving him actual meals is a good thing.", "She had the kid when she was 17 and has probably been told how to parent (judged) by almost everyone who has crossed her path. Although what you said was true I would figure out how to say it in a nicer way. The goal is to teach not to shame.", "NTA and she always has the option of moving out instead of being ungrateful for all you\u2019re doing for her and her son", "Oof NTA. If she keeps harassing you over it all her if she'd like CPS thoughts on what she feeds.", "She's staying with you... You're feeding her child nutritious food and she's nipping at your heels?\nSister needs a check from CPS.", "NTA. I'm glad your nephew has you there to feed him a variety of foods.", "NTA and PLEASE don\u2019t listen to anyone who says otherwise.\n\nThis child needs proper nutritious food and above all, he seems to crave it and enjoy it. You are doing what is best for him (after all, he can\u2019t protect himself and relies on adults to make the decisions) and his mother needs to stop making it all about her. \n\nIf she is depressed or she can\u2019t cook or she fears judgment, she can tell you - but she doesn\u2019t get to take it out on her kid and that is exactly what she\u2019s doing by trying to prevent you from feeding him a balanced diet.", "NTA. Trust me when I say no 4-year-old is going to eat something they don\u2019t want or like. They will let you know. You\u2019re being a lovely aunt, babysitting and feeding him dinner with no expectations. Her issue may not have anything to do with eating habits, but is probably some underlying resentment that she isn\u2019t willing to bring up. Or she\u2019s taking something else out on you. I\u2019m guessing her friends haven\u2019t heard the entire story but sister\u2019s version of it. I\u2019m also assuming her friends are around her age. That is YOUNG. They probably don\u2019t have kids so they don\u2019t understand and automatically took her side.\n\nBottom line, you are so NTA here.
