Black women according to pretty much every study rank the lowest on desirability scale. We are considered the least attractive of all races according to every study done about dating. We have the lowest rates of marriage and we tend to get married later than everyone else. \n\nThere is also a history of black women being considered hypersexual so while we maybe good enough for sex, we are not good enough for long term relationships. \n\nSo while you may see her as a baddie, we don\u2019t have as many options to date and there are so many land mines when trying to navigate who does find us attractive. \n\nSo yeah, we don\u2019t waste time crushing on people who we don\u2019t know if they even find us attractive.

This is tricky because while you definitely meant well, I think what your friend wanted and needed was for you to ask why she felt that way and to listen to her fears and concerns.

You complimented your friend with honesty and hyped her up as a friend should.\n\nThe sad reality is that it is a very common experience we face and we all deal with it differently. Some of us don't give 2 fs, some of us have the confidence to blast through it all, some of us have our self esteem whittled away bc of the real rejection that we are only objects of desire for our own skin colour peers. I lived in a decently white city until I was 16. Every white boy I had a crush on didn't ever view me as crushable material, one boy even pranked me by asking me out (the most popular white guy), in front of everyone and when I said yes he said sike and just burst into laughter and so did everyone else.\n\nI moved to a diverse urban city mid high school.. think a lot of black, Caribbean, Indians and Asians and a few Euros and Canadian and small amount of First Nations. I went from being the 2/10 to being OVER sexualized by how many guys asked me out, I was suddenly a 8/10 and I didn't cope well with it. All of them were POC and the ones who weren't POC one or two liked me, but a lot of them didn't realize they had fetish racial bias, as they would always love my skin and my hair and always loved coloured girls/women but would be adamant I wasn't a fetish for them just a preference. \n\nI just wanted to be seen as a girl who you can crush on. Not a skin preference or skin detractor. I've dated every race under the sun and it was compatibility that determined my partner (in addition to attractiveness).\n\nWith all that under my belt, even today being attractive, I am a 5/10 on a global scale and could be a 8 or 9 out of 10 for those who are attracted to my skin or could get past race. I have a long term partner so I'm not looking for anyone, but it's just interesting to see on average who hits on me and who finds me invisible. \n\nI know it still exists today because I have a very light skin friend but they're not white. We had an encounter where a black woman came up to us at the beach to compliment our music and making her day really fun. When re telling the story my friend was adamant it was a man who came to us and I was like how could you convince yourself a man spoke to us and it was a very clearly a feminine presenting woman, bathing suit, high voice, makeup, feminine silhouette.

So white-black interracial relationships are rare, it is important to consider how much this may be due to actual race (i.e. man doesnt like black women), or other factors (e.g., man grew up in wealthy suburb, does not have any black peers or vice versa. but if he met a black woman he got along with and had similar interests, like they were in college together in the same class because theyre the same major, then that is different)\n\nI could go on but you get the idea. \n\nWhile there are the statistics to support the feelings, the context of the statistics should also provide insight to not let it ruin your interest in the person.", "Also quite prejudiced of her to assume ALL white men are racist.", "She literally said \u201cbecause he\u2019s white\u201d yeah but go ahead and ignore that part.", "It wasn't \"idk\" it was \"probably\" that's where the tiny little line was crossed into prejudging him.", "She brought up his skin color\u2026.. did you forget to read it?

OP has done nothing wrong, they haven't invalidated their friend's experiences, and to validate her friends offence will mean that friend leaves the interaction thinking her response was acceptable and warranted when it was not. I've seen people abuse this, they believe that because they are upset the other person is wrong and therefore must kowtow to them, regardless of the legitimacy of their feelings. \n\nApologies ought to mean something, if you apologise every time someone is upset, regardless of whether you are sorry, then your words become worthless.", "I'm not lumping them together, I'm saying that a somebody *who isn't white* has a better understanding of obstacles that one can face as a *not white person* better than a *white person*. \n\nIn general, not specifically speaking on dating.", "I didn't say they were similar experiences for Asians and black people in the dating pool, I said that Asians would understand better than a white person.", "If being oppressed on one axis made us immune to oppressing on another, racism etc would be a lot easier to solve.", "Thank you for the perspective. Sucks you have had that point of view and perspective, no one should have to experience that. But thanks for clarifying.", "I think I know why it\u2019s contentious. We (or rather our brains) make prejudgements all the time about all sorts of things and people. (this is prejudice)\nHowever, when as a society everyone makes the same prejudgements about the same people, this can have a harmful effect and even be immoral.\n\nPeople conflate the meaning of prejudice with the harmful and immoral consequences it can have.", "Except she didn't pre-judge him, she acknowledged that racial preferences exist and tend to not work out for her. She said \"idk if he'd be into me\" not \"he's not into black girls, he's a racist.\" Maybe you should reread? Because in this context, it's definitely not correct, she did not make an opinion and actually just pointed out she doesn't have a clear answer. :)", "But why would we say that her thought on this is not based on reason or experience? If she has had multiple experiences with white men not being attracted to her because of her race, her idea that there\u2019s a possibility that he won\u2019t like her as well is precisely her using reason based on her experiences to assess how a situation might go? It\u2019s just an odd focus to put on the situation to call her prejudiced, standing up for the white guy who isn\u2019t even aware this is happening let alone being affected by it at all.\n\nY\u2019all would have been around in the 1600s in the American colonies hearing an Indigenous person facing genocide say they feel like they can\u2019t trust white people and respond \u201cwhoa whoa hey PREJUDICED much??\u201d the recognition of racist practices is not racist. The alternative is something akin to eating the same kind of food multiple times, getting sick from it, and continuing to eat it without thought. Pattern recognition is necessary for self-preservation. If that\u2019s a problem for you and you can\u2019t stand anyone ever having an assumption made about them based on race, then get to the root of it and upend white supremacist beauty standards lol.", "Everyone on here is trying to claim that she's prejudiced for being aware of a very Common prejudice that comes from white people towards black people. Especially black women, who statistically are the most discriminated against in this country. I can't believe the stupidity +/or ignorance on this thread.", "I\u2019m sorry but someone not liking black features does not exist in vacuum and is 100% influenced by beauty standards that reinforce white supremacy.\nBeauty is not subjective. And before you start I\u2019m black", "If you wanna call the experience the majority of black women who have tried dating outside of our race \u201ca pretend problem\u201d than there\u2019s nothing I can do to help you, I can\u2019t teach the ignorant empathy \n\nI hope you do better", "I think you're kinda missing the point. We usually think of racial prejudice as something that actively targets marginalized groups and prevents them from getting access to resources, opportunities, or fair treatment in general. This situation feels a bit different. Racial prejudice seems to be shaping what she expects from a white man, and there's a reason for that. For this woman's whole life, she's been exposed to racial prejudice against black women, including standards of beauty that center whiteness and features that white women often have (like straight hair, for example). Why do you suppose it was *such* a big deal for lots of little black girls that the new Little Mermaid looked like them? Because from a young age, there is so much in our culture and history that builds prejudice, that tells us that features that black women often have aren't beautiful, or at the very least, that Caucasian features are more beautiful.\n\nI'd believe that the OP's friend has had more than her fair share of experiences where she felt like she's not pretty or good enough to combat the internalized prejudice of white men against black women. Her \"prejudice\" isn't denying *him* anything; she's responding to the pain of her own lived experience.\n\nAll that said, OP is NTA.", "That feels like I like black men or Asian women, so let's make black women and Asian men undesirable so they are more likely to date white people", "She absolutely did not say that her experience as a Black woman was being invalidated, that\u2019s your interpretation of another person\u2019s intent, unless there\u2019s been a big-ass edit in the comments. OP and the rest of the world aren\u2019t mind-readers. Presumably OP\u2019s friend has the ability to say, \u201cThank you but when I said X it\u2019s because of Y, not because I was feeling down about my looks/school/etc.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t disagree with the points you\u2019ve been making but let\u2019s not be twisting words or applying intent to someone that none of us know; there\u2019s no point to a discussion if it\u2019s going to be standing on such weak legs.", "See your statement right? There is completely condescending patronizing an invalidating of the experience of us as black women. Thank you so much for that.", "I mean, OP clearly stated that the friend said that that was her lived experience, so now you're just ignoring inconvenient data to try and push your point.", "Not finding whatever ethnicity sexually attractive isn't racism.   \nLiterally every ethnic group on earth is like this. \n\nThat would be like calling me a homophobe because I'm straight and don't want to put my dick in a man. \n\nIf OPs friend is attracted to white guys, and generally white guys are less likely to be attracted to black women, then she has the choice to just shoot her shot and maybe get rejected or not.   \nIt's not racist of those guys to not be into her because of their sexual preferences.", "> So do we always just apologize because someone is upset, or do those people sometimes have to own their own feelings?\n\nThis is a good point. My intention was to encourage people to think about how their response would be received by the other person.\n\nIf the other person is someone who you respect and care about, then you would show that in your response. If they are an honest and empathetic person, then they wouldn't manipulate you emotionally.\n\nHowever, if they are the type of person who abuses your empathy, then the friendship is not healthy. Continuing to apologize will only damage your own self esteem.", "If gratifying your ego like that is more important to you than the friendship, then go ahead.", "But this scenario is in relation to dating so your point isn't relevant at all then is it.", "\u201cMinority Olympics0 lmao\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I think people are actually conflating prejudice and racism. They are not the same thing.  We prejudge people all the time for many different reasons.  It's not inherently racist to do so.", "She did pre-judge him. \"He's white so he probably doesn't like black girls\". Clear as day that's a premade judgement based on skin color", "So if you have an experience with an individual within a group of people you can make generalizations and it's not prejudiced?\n\nCool, I'll go tell every racist white guy who was mugged or robbed by a black person that they are 100% justified in avoiding black people and treating them all as potential threats.\n\nIf you have bad experiences with individuals and then make generalizations to the entire group they're apart of, you're being shitty", "Both, actually.", "I'm not missing anything...\n\nBy definition, what her friend did is racially prejudice.  I understand she has had experiences that made her the way she is, but that doesn't change the fact that she looked at this guy and assumed he wouldn't like her just because and only because of the color of his skin.  I can't say I even blame her...I can't imagine, but all the same...racial prejudice.  100%.", "It\u2019s literally in the post. Go back and read it. She said her friend is invalidating her feelings as a black woman.  \n\nIt\u2019s right there.", "[deleted]", "I never made that argument, so you are shadow boxing straw man arguments here. \n\nI tend to agree with you. Calling someone racist for their preference is, IMO, the same as shaming a homosexual person for their preference. \n\nWe don\u2019t build our own brains and likely have little personal responsibility for our preferences, unless they are deliberate.", "Fair enough.", "I read and responded to the comment before it was edited.", "Racism isn't rational", "Ok, I'll say it another way: the black woman in the post experienced racism. Systemic racism exists and it influences what we believe is beautiful and whom we believe will be an appropriate partner. \n\nThe man is almost certainly not a racist, but he was raised in a society where systemic racism is definitely a thing. The woman is \"prejudiced\" insofar as she is (correctly) assuming that he has been exposed to the ideas and values that are perpetuated by systemic racism. Whether the man has internalized any of this or acts on it? Who knows, but I don't blame her for not wanting to risk it. \n\nAgain, her prejudice doesn't cause harm to the man; she's not denying him anything he needs to have a good life or instilling in him that he's \"less than\" due to his skin color. She's not being unfair to him. She's responding to her own experience with systemic racism.", "yes but in the context of \"you can get any man\", obviously statistically no matter what she looked like she probably cant get ANY man lol, so imo shes saying when op said \"you can get any man\" it invalidated what she has experienced in life, regardless of if there is a chance (big or small) that this white guy likes her, others havent for whatever reason.", "I'm aware she experienced racism, but that still doesn't change anything.  She judged this guy based on his skin color.  Full stop.  \n\nI'm sure she has her reasons and I'm sure she's experienced some terrible things, but at the end of the day, no matter how justified her thoughts may be, she looked at a guy she didn't know and saw his white skin and assumed he wouldn't like her due to him having white skin.  She saw his skin color and based her opinion of him on that much alone.  \n\nIts not very different from a white woman clutching her purse when a couple black guys walk past her in the street.  Maybe she had been robbed by a couple black guys in the past.  She would be using her personal experience and passing judgement accordingly.  Its almost exactly the same.", "[deleted]", "Couple things, first, OP says \"she has been crushing on this white man,\" so she's probably interacted with him and her entire opinion of him isn't solely based on the color of his skin. As a white person, I understand that \"being white\" doesn't simply mean you have white skin, but that's a bit of a tangent.\n\nSecond, using language like \"she judged him based on the color of his skin\" makes it seem like you're implying that she's a racist. Her prejudice on its own doesn't make her a racist; her prejudice is in and of itself is a response to racism."]}
