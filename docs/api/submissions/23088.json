Black women according to pretty much every study rank the lowest on desirability scale. We are considered the least attractive of all races according to every study done about dating. We have the lowest rates of marriage and we tend to get married later than everyone else. \n\nThere is also a history of black women being considered hypersexual so while we maybe good enough for sex, we are not good enough for long term relationships. \n\nSo while you may see her as a baddie, we don\u2019t have as many options to date and there are so many land mines when trying to navigate who does find us attractive. \n\nSo yeah, we don\u2019t waste time crushing on people who we don\u2019t know if they even find us attractive.

This is tricky because while you definitely meant well, I think what your friend wanted and needed was for you to ask why she felt that way and to listen to her fears and concerns.

You complimented your friend with honesty and hyped her up as a friend should.\n\nThe sad reality is that it is a very common experience we face and we all deal with it differently. Some of us don't give 2 fs, some of us have the confidence to blast through it all, some of us have our self esteem whittled away bc of the real rejection that we are only objects of desire for our own skin colour peers. I lived in a decently white city until I was 16. Every white boy I had a crush on didn't ever view me as crushable material, one boy even pranked me by asking me out (the most popular white guy), in front of everyone and when I said yes he said sike and just burst into laughter and so did everyone else.\n\nI moved to a diverse urban city mid high school.. think a lot of black, Caribbean, Indians and Asians and a few Euros and Canadian and small amount of First Nations. I went from being the 2/10 to being OVER sexualized by how many guys asked me out, I was suddenly a 8/10 and I didn't cope well with it. All of them were POC and the ones who weren't POC one or two liked me, but a lot of them didn't realize they had fetish racial bias, as they would always love my skin and my hair and always loved coloured girls/women but would be adamant I wasn't a fetish for them just a preference. \n\nI just wanted to be seen as a girl who you can crush on. Not a skin preference or skin detractor. I've dated every race under the sun and it was compatibility that determined my partner (in addition to attractiveness).\n\nWith all that under my belt, even today being attractive, I am a 5/10 on a global scale and could be a 8 or 9 out of 10 for those who are attracted to my skin or could get past race. I have a long term partner so I'm not looking for anyone, but it's just interesting to see on average who hits on me and who finds me invisible. \n\nI know it still exists today because I have a very light skin friend but they're not white. We had an encounter where a black woman came up to us at the beach to compliment our music and making her day really fun. When re telling the story my friend was adamant it was a man who came to us and I was like how could you convince yourself a man spoke to us and it was a very clearly a feminine presenting woman, bathing suit, high voice, makeup, feminine silhouette.
