You were just trying to be a good friend.", "Nta That\u2019s standard girl speak generally . Most people would assume that she wants you to big her up , how are you meant to know her insecurities if she hasn\u2019t told you yet \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.", "NTA. She's drawing a very sharp boundary. I think she should have just bulldozed past your complimented and insisted on talking more about her experiences.", "NTA you had the best of intentions and were encouraging her. You have nothing to feel guilty about.", "NTA. \n\nShe has both self esteem issues AND prejudices against this guy all rolled into one.  Getting mad at you is just ridiculous. \n\nMaybe she has had bad experiences with white guys before, but that doesn't mean that you are invalidating her experiences by trying to compliment her. \n\nShe sounds just too sensitive.  She wants to have a pity party and you to join.", "NTA. \n\nAlthough it is true that you do not know what life looks like through your eyes, she also made an assumption. Hers was based on race. Yours, if all you said was she\u2019s a baddie, took race out of the equation.", "NTA. You\u2019re just trying to boost her up", "NAH, she told you how she felt and why, I understand that you wanted to be encouraging but in that moment it sounds like she didn't want that. Statistically speaking there have been many \"reports\" posted all over the place about how people see Black women as less desirable than other groups. She clearly has some stuff to work through, and you obviously did not mean anything negative by your comment, so NAH. Now you just know the next time she does something like that to not say anything and just let her vent. Sometimes people just say things without really needing or wanting a response.", "Oh geez, NTA.", "NAH- This sounds like an issue of cultural experience. It sounds like your friend wanted to discuss a societal issue with the black experience and you wanted to boost her confidence because she is a human being of worth. She\u2019s not really an AH for feeling unheard. You are not an AH for wanting to boost her confidence.", "NAH. I just want to give you a heads up though. Black women according to pretty much every study rank the lowest on desirability scale. We are considered the least attractive of all races according to every study done about dating. We have the lowest rates of marriage and we tend to get married later than everyone else. \n\nThere is also a history of black women being considered hypersexual so while we maybe good enough for sex, we are not good enough for long term relationships. \n\nSo while you may see her as a baddie, we don\u2019t have as many options to date and there are so many land mines when trying to navigate who does find us attractive. \n\nSo yeah, we don\u2019t waste time crushing on people who we don\u2019t know if they even find us attractive. You didn\u2019t know but now you do. \n\nSo please learn from this. She may be a baddie but she is not the baddie that everyone wants to date or marry.\n\nHere\u2019s a link to a study. https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/mcnairsymposium/2020/presentations/12/", "NTA- how is her assuming the white guy wont like her any different from your assumption?", "Lmao you US people like a lot to act like a victim huh. Tf does \u201cinvalidating my experiences as a black female\u201d mean. Ffs", "NTA\nYou were being positive and supporting your friend.  It is unfortunate that she has been negatively impacted by past attempts. Unless she had shared those, you would not know about them.  Help her out, ask the dude if he's interested in getting to know her or not. He may be holding back, figuring she doesn't like white guys, which her being reserved and repressing her feelings is reinforcing.", "Ok, so you just stepped on her third rail.\n\nLook, boosting a friends confidence and telling them they are a hottie and any man would be lucky - it\u2019s pretty standard girl encouragement. In your, and I think, most young ladies experience. \n\nBut, here we are. Your friend has issues. They are not your issues to deal with. She needs to talk this out with a therapist. You are students together, why don\u2019t you stick to the academic stuff. NTA", "NTA \n\nyou were trying to be supportive and she took it as racial discrimination you can only control what you say not how people take it.", "NTA", "NTA your friend has a chip on her shoulder so her view on life is warped", "This victimhood is going too far", "As a white dude whose friends are all in interracial relationships, I guarantee you unless this is some Deep South shit, that girls black friends will give her more shit for dating a white guy than his white friends will give him for dating a black girl.\n\nETA: switching from N T A to NAH because your friend probably has legitimate experiences that make her worried about the whole situation.", "NTA. She\u2019s projecting her insecurities onto you", "NTA you were boosting her up.", "Soft YTA. You meant well and were trying to lift her spirits but instead you used toxic positivity to invalidate her experience as a Black woman. She knows her life and what she\u2019s been through; positive but empty platitudes like what you said aren\u2019t helpful. \n\nOthers here have already posted about how Black women are usually viewed as less desirable - read and pay attention to those comments. Also, please keep in mind that as an Asian woman, you\u2019re part of a group that is considered VERY desirable by white men (and that fetishization is also a massive problem, don\u2019t get me wrong) so your perspective about this may be incredibly different from hers. \n\nI think as long as you apologize, thank her for her emotional labor in explaining why you were in the wrong, and refrain from doing this again, you\u2019ll be fine.", "NTA. Your friend is stupid and with that attitude, it\u2019s no wonder she has t found a man!", "Your friends like she has her own self esteem and anxiety issues. She\u2019s also self triggering which is a trait that usually increases anxiety for someone. You did nothing wrong. She\u2019s being a grown baby", "NTA. You were giving her a compliment, and she twisted it into an insult. I understand it might be hard for her to move on from past hurt, but she can't live that way. There are plenty of interracial couples in the world.", "What you did is a kind of toxic positivity. You just brushed of her experiences. Maybe just ask her why she was thinking so and if he gave her bad vibes maybe.\n\nFor many black women its a sad reality that many men just dont want to date black women.\n\nNAH, but you should be more sensetive about such things.\n\nSee, you wouldnt like it if you told her your worry that a guy just as yellow fewer because he wants to date you and she would say that you a baddie and  any man would be lucky to have you. Thats not helpful but dismissive of your feelings and fears.", "NAH. You're not an AH for trying to pump up your friend. She's also not wrong in that some guys do have a prejudice against Black women, and I'm sure she's encountered that before.", "Hmmm. This is tricky because while you definitely meant well, I think what your friend wanted and needed was for you to ask why she felt that way and to listen to her fears and concerns. In a way, you did dismiss what she was saying, though you were attempting to be positive. So while your intentions were good, your reaction was not well judged and you did not hear what she was trying to tell you. So, unfortunately, YTA here.", "Yta u were invalidating her experience.and u not realizing that is a problem", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NAH but op should be careful in the future", "Thanks for sharing this important information.", "Right but that doesn't mean she shouldn't even try or should take encouragement as a slight. \n\nI'm a south asian man, as far as the totem pole of attractiveness goes, we're not high up at all. If you take other factors like my height and looks into consideration, I fall even lower. If I took my friends' encouragement as insults, I'd not only still be single but I'd also be friendless.\n\nA key aspect of friendship is encouraging and comforting each other regarding our insecurities and worries. Most people would rather have a friend that comforts them and points out their good aspects instead of keeping silent or even agreeing when you're upset about your perceived attractiveness.\n\nYes, as a black woman the statistics may not be in your favour. Yes, interracial relationships (as that's what was in the post) come with their own challenges and difficulties despite the strides we've made. But that doesn't mean you should give up without trying (ofc it's fine if you do decide to not try) or that your friend trying to encourage you warrants such a bad response.", "So even though they're friends OP can only ever talk about academics in case she offends her friend?\n\nShe said nothing wrong or race-related, she was just trying to boost her friend's self-esteem.", "I think it\u2019s a NAH situation.  It is way easier for an Asian woman than a black woman to date a white man (there is a ton of evidence backing up that statement).  OP\u2019s friend could have been softer, but denying the reality of the world doesn\u2019t help anyone.", "it\u2019s not a chip on her shoulder though? it\u2019s real experiences plus actual studies that show that black women are placed the lowest on the desirability scale. It is completely fair for her to have the assumption that a white man may not be interested in her due to the colour of skin, no matter how pretty she is"]}
