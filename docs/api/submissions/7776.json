Furthermore, it sounds like you've raised an amazing daughter.", "Nta and Op time to dump someone please your future depends on breaking up", "ESH\n\nI think everyone here could have done better. You should have kept the 3 rooms and smoke in yours / go outside if needed. 3 rooms was the original expectation and was changed without discussion. You accepted the GF daughter to come, so it's now your responsibility to do your best to make things \"feel\" equal. Even though the double is for two people, the other daughter may feel isolated whether you realize it not (I say maybe because you don't say much about her so I don't know how she react). \n\nThis is what the GF is concerned about, which I think is a reasonable concern because any potential partner will need to get along with their daughter. During the argument, I think you fell prey to moving the goal post fallacy (if that's what it's called). The original \"goal\" was talking about if a single vs. A double room is fair and will cause any hurt feelings. You \"moved the goalpost\" to being about who is paying for what, which is a separate issue. I do think the GF should be contributing to the costs, but that is besides the point of this argument. You already agreed to bringing her along and paying, so it's not helpful to bring up funds until the argument about equality is settled first. The \"you want it you pay for it\" or \"I'm paying so my way is correct\" are common ways thinking, but they are not always right and I don't think they lead to any constructive conversation about difference in expectations.\n\nGF is also judged because calling you an idiot was not constructive. It's difficult to tell from the way you wrote it, but sounds like she may have pestered you into letting the daughter come, which is also not good. It's not rude or unreasonable to ask, but it should be a sit down serious conversation with her accepting your \"no I am not ready for that yet\" answer.\n\nI don't have enough info to judge the other daughter, but even if she agreed at first to the room upgrade, perhaps she didn't have the courage to express her opinion with you as you are kind of an adult stranger. Maybe check in with her before making decisions like that (assuming you didn't based on the way the post is written). \n\nIt's understandable though that if she said yes to you but complained to her mom about the room change that you would feel annoyed. It's been 8 months, maybe you and the other daughter should get more bonding time to make her feel more comfortable talking to you? That's beyond the scope of this post though.\n\nHonestly, this could have been avoided by saying no (you said so yourself you were reluctant) and providing an alternative like taking the 3 of you (or better yet all 4) on a different vacation.", "Well I am attempting to do the math \n2 people = Double room\n1 person = Single Room\n3 people = Double + Single Room\n4 people = Double + Double Room\n\nUnless there\u2019s an imaginary person with you guys I don\u2019t see why you need 2 double rooms", "NTA - 8 months isn\u2019t long enough for these kinds of demands", "YTA For smoking with kids around, no matter how hard you try, the people you live with are exposed to second hand smoke, and there is no safe level of second hand smoke exposure.", "Good grief, yes, this!!!
