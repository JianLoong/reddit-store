I would have done the same", "NTA holy crap that's gross. not sure in what world your two friends think it's fine to stink up a whole restaurant and soil a table that people *eat* off of.", "NTA - a dinner table is never an appropriate location to change a baby's diaper.  It's a biohazard!  Who would want to eat at that table after that?  GROSS!!!", "Probably an unpopular opinion but definitely NTA\n\nThat is not only incredibly unsanitary for someone who might eat there, but for the baby as well.\n\nYou didn't intentionally have them kicked out, this was the decision of the restaurant, and you didn't insert yourself into it directly which could've ended badly.\n\nYou are there to eat, not smell baby sh\\*t just because the mom was too lazy to take 30 seconds to walk to the bathrooms there.", "NTA.  That\u2019s foul and a safety hazard.", "NTA. There is absolutely no excuse for changing baby diapers in an area where people are eating or preparing food. If you have a baby, you know that dirty diapers are a probability on any outing and you prepare ahead of time.", "I understand that sometimes a baby needs to get changed immediately so they don't get a rash, but not on a table where people eat. That's totally unsanitary and could potentially get the restaurant in trouble. Not sure they needed to kick her out, but that definitely wasn't your fault. NTA", "NTA. Fucking ew.", "NTA, anybody with any sense, knows it's unsanitary. If you hadn't said anything, the staff wouldn't have known to take the extra measures to sanitize the table. The next people, throughout the night, could have become very ill from her changing a diaper on the table. That could ruin a restaurant's reputation.", "NTA - gross.", "NTA - they were way out of line,  you can't change poopie diapers next to people trying to enjoy a nice meal at a restaurant.", "1. You do not change a baby on a table in a restaurant\n\n2. I\u2019m hung up in the fact you\u2019re hung up on something that happened a year ago. You ok?", "NTA - thats gross and to do it at a table where people eat is a health hazard.", "NTA for sure. She couldn\u2019t use the changing table in the bathroom?

Who in their right mind would change a baby on a table in the middle of a restaurant? That's what changing tables are for!", "NTA. I\u2019m a mother of two and if a location didn\u2019t have a changing table in the bathroom, I took my kid and changed their diaper in the trunk of my car.", "NTA. You pointed it out to the hostess, but that doesn\u2019t mean that none of the other staff saw this. She\u2019s changing a freaking diaper out in the open! There was a very, very good chance some member of staff was going to notice that! That\u2019s incredibly disgusting (hence their level of cleaning) and they weren\u2019t going to just ignore that if they noticed. Your friends saying you were wrong\u2026 1) Do they want to eat at a table where a poopy diaper was just changed? Probably not. (I know I wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019ve changed plenty of diapers. I don\u2019t want to then eat where one was changed. Nope.) 2) Do they really believe that absolutely no one that works there noticed what was happening? Not one single server came out on the floor? I doubt it. Most likely someone did notice it. They then had to pick their jaws up of the floor, probably had a brief \u201comg, did you see that?\u201d with a couple coworkers, and then notified a member of management that this nasty woman just plopped her kid on the table and changed a poopy diaper. (And I suspect this is what happened because you got back to the table and they came out to confront her. It couldn\u2019t have taken you very long to go to the hostess and back. Probably about the same amount of time for an employee to spot what was happening, go get a manager, and come out.)", "NTA.", "Your friends are just as deranged as the mom who apparently never went to a public restroom before. NTA.", "As a mother of infant twins, I say NTA. It\u2019s a restaurant and this is a safety hazard. Most restaurants have a diaper changing station in the restroom. If they don\u2019t, bring baby to the car and change it there.", "NTA. People EAT ON THOSE TABLES. She is a total b\\*tch for doing that.", "NTA.. that\u2019s a safety hazard cuz feces and eating surfaces. Sounds like you did it politely and it was the restaurant\u2019s decision to ask them to leave, not yours. Even if you gotta change your kid in public, do it on the floor or on a chair, not on the table.

Second, what that mum was doing was so gross and rude", "NTA, that's how people get sick, and restaurants pay the price for it. That lady could have given someone hepatitis, e coli. That's why they kicked her out. That could shut down a restaurant  and the place didn't wanna risk the law suits and health code violations.", "NTA. You are a hero.

Obviously her own poor choice was the issue, but I think it was coincidence that you told the hostess and she was asked to leave. I think an employee noticed and she was already going to be told to get out. I certainly hope that they wouldn\u2019t be willing to ignore that unless someone complains. I really wouldn\u2019t want to eat at a restaurant that doesn\u2019t have an issue with that unless someone complains.", "I mean I agree with you. I\u2019m saying worst case scenario, you still don\u2019t use the table"]}
