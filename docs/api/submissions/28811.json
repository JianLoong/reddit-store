I can drive myself to school and back every day.\n\nAs of the start of this year, my sister(14F) started attending the same high school as me. I offer to drive her to school everyday, even though it is about a 15 minute walk to school. \n\nFirst, our school starts at 8:30 am, but I prefer to be at school for 8:00am, so that means we must be backing out of our driveway for 7:50ish. I guess this must have been to early to my sister, because she eventually would start getting into my car later than I wanted. First time, she was a minute late. She then proceeded to add another minute onto that every few days. I caught on to this real quick and told her repeatedly what time we were supposed to be leaving. She would just scoff at me and retort with something like \"I can take as much time as I want and you will just have to put up with it\".\n\nSecond are from the rides from school back to our house. I have a free period at the end of the day, so I usually spend that time hanging out with friends, doing homework, are something else related to school. But I sometimes leave early.\n\nMy sister has an issue with this, simply because she doesn't want to walk the 15 minutes back home. What is really aggravating, is she said I need to MAKE IT UP to her for making her walk, which I think is just stupid.\n\nToday was the last straw for me. We ended up leaving 20 MINUTES LATER than we were supposed to. She said she would be ready in 2 MINUTES!\n\nI decided to leave early today. Just like usual, I told my sister, and again, she was not happy about it, but I didn't care. So she gets home and she just starts screaming at me. She says that I can't keep making her walk from school all the time and how it is unfair and rude. Side note: I was the one who original offered her rides to school, so I don't know why she feels she can dictate this.\n\nI wasn't in the mood to deal with her nonsense, so I told her she can walk to AND from school all week next week. She wasn't happy with that and started screaming like a fucking Banshee. At this point, I was pissed, and locked myself in my room.\n\nMy sister told my parents, and they both say I'm being selfish. Honestly, I don't feel like I am doing anything wrong here. Considering I pay the insurance on my car and I haven't got a single \"Thank you\" from her, I feel I'm in the right.\n\nAm I delusional or something though?\n\nAITA?\n\nContext: I can leave school early because I have no class the last period. I got the car from my grandparents as a birthday gift. I get to school early either to chat with friends or to do some quick studying. The drive to school is only slightly quicker because of the road network, and the route my sister does take when she walks has some shortcuts.", "created_utc": 1697170374, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176q5ac/aita_for_refusing_to_drive_my_sister_to_school/", "score": 295, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your good nature & good deeds are seeing you punished (via not arriving when *you* want).\n\nHer getting a ride either way, is entirely up to you (regardless of who is paying the car's expenses, ugh) (***IF*** parents had provided the car *and* made being her chauffer a condition, it would be different, maybe.)\n\nIn the future, you *could* still offer. \"I'm backing out of the driveway as soon as the clock hits 7.50 (set an alarm?), if you are ***in*** the car, great. If you aren't? Guess what? Walking for you. Just out the door walking to the car? Walking. Hand on the car door to open? Walking. As for a ride home? ***If*** I happen to still be there and you are in the car before I start it to leave? Fine. Otherwise, you're walking.\"\n\nRemember all steps count.

You have completely reasonable expectations for the recipient of this generosity.\n\nThe only concern was to have let it continue for as long as you did.\n\nThe behavior you allow is the behavior you will get.", "NTA.  I would be on your side as a parent.  once the week is over, if you consider being kind enough to give your sister rides again, just pull out of the driveway at 7:50.  She can either be there on time to go with you, or walk.  If you leave at 7:50, she still has plenty of time to walk to school. \n\nAnd a 15 minute walk home a few days a week is too much for her?  That's ridiculous.", "NTA\n\nSit everyone down and say the following:\n\n'I will be leaving at 7:50 every morning. If you want a lift, you're in the car by then. If you're not, I will go without you. I will not wait a single minute. If I'm around at the end of the day, I will give you a lift, but only if it suits my schedule. I am not a taxi, and I will not be treated like one. If you're unhappy about any of this, tough.'\n\nRemind your parents that you walked to and from school, and you're fine. If they want her to have a chauffeur, they can hire one.", "NTA. Tell her what time you leave, and leave at that time every morning. She can make it on time or not if she wants a ride. As for going home, if she needs a ride and you are not there, that's your parents job.", "NTA- a suggestion. The next time you CHOOSE to drive her tell her you are leaving exactly at 7:50 whether she is in a car or not.  If she is not ready, leave her there. Keep doing this. Every.songle. time.  She'll either learn to be on time or enjoy the walk.", "INFO Will your sister also be getting a car from the grandparents when she turns 16 and did you have to walk to and from school before you got yours? If the answer is no to either of these, you are not in the clear. \n\nOtherwise she's being very ungrateful and I'd limit your ride offer to, you can come if you get in the car the same time I do. No more waiting. And also no ride if you're going to get yelled at.", "NTA.  \nYour sister is the little princess, isn't she?  \nTell her what time you are leaving in the morning, give her a warning at 7:45 and then leave at 7:50 as planned. You've offered her a ride, she doesn't get to dictate the terms.  \nAs far as the ride home, she should be grateful for the times you wait for her instead of throwing fits when you don't. If she can't be gracious, just leave early every day. She'll figure it out.", "NTA. And your parents should be making her conform to your schedule. There was one year my two were in hs at the same time and it was great for us not having to drive. But younger used to drag their heels, so we started telling the older to leave so they weren't BOTH late. It was a PITA, but we were fine taking younger.\n\nAS A PARENT - I'd tell sis to suck it up - you cannot do this to your bro. 15 min walk isn't bad. Make a friend and walk with them. Listen to music on the way.", "INFO: how did you get to and from school when you were her age? It seems like your parents are expecting her to have privileges they were fine with you not having. It also seems like they\u2019re taking the side of the kid who makes the biggest fuss.", "Nta your sisters a brat", "Man I used to walk like 30 to 45 mins to school. (30 in summer ,45 in winter if no sidewalks where shoveled. I lived on the same block as the school just waaaayyyyy down) she can walk. Keeps you skinny!", "NTA. Leave whenever the hell you want, if she's in the car good for her. If not, too fucking bad. You're not a taxi. Frankly the first time she mouthed off I would have made her walk for a month. Second time, all year. Exercise is healthy and a pissed off older brother isn't. You'd be doing her a favor.", "NTA.

That's not a realistic fear.\n\n>  Predators are exactly looking for a 14 year old girl walking alone to snatch and kidnap\n\nNo, they're not. This is absurd.", "Lol too much Netflix.

You wouldn\u2019t know about these things. I\u2019m the same age as your father and mother. Ask them about  their opinion about child predators and how they scope out their victims. If a child predator saw a 14-year-old walking alone on the street while driving, what does common sense tell you what they would do or think about doing. And if you don\u2019t think child predators are in your neighborhood, you\u2019re wrong they are. \n\n Google it, look at YouTube,  research it and educate yourself. If you still think I\u2019m wrong,  thats fine. I\u2019m not here to rag on you dude.  but the consequences of what you\u2019re doing are far greater than just your typical brother-mad-at-his sister. \n\nYour sister is not excused herself: she should grow up and stop wasting your time when you\u2019re taking the time out of your busy schedule to drive her to school.

Are his wants less important than his sister\u2019s wants?", "She's much more likely to die in a car wreck than she is being kidnapped. In fact the two aren't even comparable statistically speaking.
