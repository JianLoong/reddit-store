{"id": 28811, "submission_id": "176q5ac", "title": "AITA for refusing to drive my sister to school for a week?", "selftext": "I(17M) am currently in my last year of high school. I can drive myself to school and back every day.\n\nAs of the start of this year, my sister(14F) started attending the same high school as me. I offer to drive her to school everyday, even though it is about a 15 minute walk to school. \n\nFirst, our school starts at 8:30 am, but I prefer to be at school for 8:00am, so that means we must be backing out of our driveway for 7:50ish. I guess this must have been to early to my sister, because she eventually would start getting into my car later than I wanted. First time, she was a minute late. She then proceeded to add another minute onto that every few days. I caught on to this real quick and told her repeatedly what time we were supposed to be leaving. She would just scoff at me and retort with something like \"I can take as much time as I want and you will just have to put up with it\".\n\nSecond are from the rides from school back to our house. I have a free period at the end of the day, so I usually spend that time hanging out with friends, doing homework, are something else related to school. But I sometimes leave early.\n\nMy sister has an issue with this, simply because she doesn't want to walk the 15 minutes back home. What is really aggravating, is she said I need to MAKE IT UP to her for making her walk, which I think is just stupid.\n\nToday was the last straw for me. We ended up leaving 20 MINUTES LATER than we were supposed to. She said she would be ready in 2 MINUTES!\n\nI decided to leave early today. Just like usual, I told my sister, and again, she was not happy about it, but I didn't care. So she gets home and she just starts screaming at me. She says that I can't keep making her walk from school all the time and how it is unfair and rude. Side note: I was the one who original offered her rides to school, so I don't know why she feels she can dictate this.\n\nI wasn't in the mood to deal with her nonsense, so I told her she can walk to AND from school all week next week. She wasn't happy with that and started screaming like a fucking Banshee. At this point, I was pissed, and locked myself in my room.\n\nMy sister told my parents, and they both say I'm being selfish. Honestly, I don't feel like I am doing anything wrong here. Considering I pay the insurance on my car and I haven't got a single \"Thank you\" from her, I feel I'm in the right.\n\nAm I delusional or something though?\n\nAITA?\n\nContext: I can leave school early because I have no class the last period. I got the car from my grandparents as a birthday gift. I get to school early either to chat with friends or to do some quick studying. The drive to school is only slightly quicker because of the road network, and the route my sister does take when she walks has some shortcuts.", "created_utc": 1697170374, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176q5ac/aita_for_refusing_to_drive_my_sister_to_school/", "score": 127, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His parents put nothing towards the car or had this be a chore. \n\nWhich is why her not being on time everyday after he repeatedly reminded her and waited for her 20 minutes late is on her. He is doing this as a favor and she is crossing his boundary.  \n\nAs far as the leaving early he only offered to take her to school. He knew his last period was a no class period and as such the school gave him permission to go home early. He was doing this before he offered and she knew as well. \n\nI understand her side of things. It sucks that she is a freshman and can\u2019t leave school like he can. However if his school day is done he shouldn\u2019t have to wait around for hers to finish everyday. Once in a while ok. If it\u2019s a downpour or snowing out then that would be acceptable. Not everyday just because her day isn\u2019t done. He is her older brother not her parent.", "YTA. Your reason for leaving early isn't reasonable and sounds more like you're trying to lord having a car over your sister than actually caring about it. Then you're arbitrarily leaving early with what sounds like little notice to your sister when what you'd do instead is the same thing you're enforcing the departure time for.", "How is it unreasonable for him to leave school when he's done with school?

She should not be surprised to find you gone.  You should give her decent notice if she is going to have to walk home.", " NTA. If she forgot this was a courtesy. Tell her when you are leaving and if she isn\u2019t on her way out within a couple of minutes leave without her.  The beauty of the time that you leave means she still has plenty of to walk.

If she wants a ride she needs to be ready by then, if she wants to take longer that's up to her, but you won't be waiting. Choices have consequences and you aren't going to wait around for her ( which is her being selfish with your time btw).\n\nBesides did you not have to walk to and from school when you where her age? You need to remind her your car is a privilege and she is not entitled to it. Any further disagreement or arguing will result in no rides at all forever.\n\nSounds like she's not used to a dose of consequences.", "NTA she can walk and if your parents have an issue with it they can take time out of their day to take her ungrateful butt.", "NTA.\n\nYou're doing her a favor. You set the terms. Buses don't wait, and neither should you.", "NTA\n\nGetting driven to school is a privilege and not a right especially when there are busses that will be happy to drive you to and from school. \n\nWhen I drove my siblings there was a set time to leave and 2 heads ups/warnings (10 minute before we leave and we are leaving). We agreed that if you aren\u2019t there we are leaving because no one should be late due to one person - this is not the moment to be the three musketeers. \n\nWe told our mom of our agreement so there is a \u201cthird party view\u201d to make sure expectations are realistic. Our mom supported and backed up our agreement so no one could say that it was unfair and was required to be hold accountable for their actions. \n\nThe after school pickup is up to you since you have a free period and it\u2019s just a 15 min walk or bus ride away from home. It\u2019s up to the driver. I still picked up my siblings when I had a free period like you did but again that up to you. \n\nAgain NTA. Being driven to/from school is a privilege not a right. \n\nYour parents need to be parents and teach that actions have consequences. No one in real life will wait for her if she is late. People have people to see, places to go.", "NTA.  My brother drove me to school and back and I knew I was on his time because he was doing me a favor.  There was a perfectly good bus I could've waited in the cold for, but he thought I would like it better going with him so we could get some breakfast and hang out with friends before school started.  I was very grateful and appreciative.  It sucked so much when he graduated and I had to start taking the bus (I didn't get my license until after I graduated, personal choice).  \n\nYour sister is acting like an entitled brat. The walk to and from school will either do her some good and knock her down a peg, or she'll become even worse.  As for your parents, well they can drive her from now on.", "Also, how did OP get to school before he got a car? I'm assuming he didn't have access to a driver who left on his whim. Likely walked, possibly got a ride at the convenience of a parent. \n\nWhy does anyone think the sister is entitled to anything other than what OP had? Sib rides are a privilege.", "Can add you aren't her private driver. They can see it as a bus in public transport. If she's not by the bus stop. Too bad.", "Exactly, no need to complicate things. Just leave whenever you want. If she's ready she can jump in, if not she can walk.", "Maybe add in a selfie text message to your sister (if she has her own phone) and to your parents taken from your car out the front of your house with a message saying \"I'm leaving\" if your sister isn't there on time that way your parents know everyday she isn't on time. That way she can't accuse you of not following the agreement.\n\nYour NTA, 99% of the time sibling lifts to school are privileges not rights (the 1% are the agreements made in extenuating circumstances which this doesn't sound like).", "Lol. Why is the y so far down.", "NTA tell her you leave at 08:00 if she's not in the car she walks to school. It's that simple and do it.\n\nAlso leaving: send her an SMS if it's not the usual leaving time. She's there great you take her home , she's not she gets a 15 minute walk home."]}
