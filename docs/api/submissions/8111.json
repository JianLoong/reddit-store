Basically, my gf's family is going on a cruise over spring break and they wanted me to come. We are both seniors so this is our last spring break of college. I decided not to go because of these reasons:\n\n1. They are offering to pay for half so I would have to drop around $300-400 and I am just not a big cruise guy so it isnt too exciting to me to have to spend that much on something I do not really wanna do\n\n2. I wanted to see my family for a few days because once I graduate (I am a senior) life will be getting busy and idk if I will be able to come home much. Our school is 12 hours away from my home while her house is about 30 minutes away from our school so I dont know if she really understands the feelings I have about this. She can see her family everyday while I see them every so often. i miss them a lot especially since my parents are getting older (in their mid-late 60s) and my grandma is old (about to turn 88). This time with them is valuable to me.\n\n3. I will have homework over break for sure and idk if i could do it on a 10 day cruise.\n\n4. They go on a cruise every year, so when its not my last spring break of college I can go.\n\n5. I am planning on visiting my friend for a weekend at the beginning of break because he visited my school and I have talked about visiting him since freshman year and this is honestly the last chance I can get at visiting him.\n\nAnyways, she is pretty dissapointed and mad at me beacuse her sisters bf is coming on the trip and so is her brothers gf. This makes a lot of sense to me but overall I think I just can not go. I am trying to be nice about it and I sent a long text to her dad saying how grateful I am for the invite but I unfortunately can not make the trip.

You're allowed to prioritize what you need and she's allowed to be sad about it. I think your reasons are valid and I also think that just because you're partners doesn't mean you always have to do everything together and you'll definitely not always want the same things.", "NAH - they want you to go, if you dont want to, dont. Doesnt make you an AH.", "INFO: Is your GF just disappointed, or is she actively angry with you? It\u2019s understandable if she\u2019s just sad not to spend time with you, but if she\u2019s mad *at you* then she\u2019s the AH. Your reasons are valid, and if she doesn\u2019t support that then she\u2019s being extremely selfish.", "NTA.  You've given very valid reasons not to go.  \n\nYour gf being disappointed is normal.  Being angry with your decision is unreasonable.  If she really cares about you, she would totally support your decisions, especially seeing your parents and grandmother.\n\nGo on the cruise next year.", "NAH. It's OK that your gf is disappointed you aren't going. \n\nI'm sure in the future you will be disappointed when a person doesn't do something you really want then to do, too.", "NTA. She wants you there to help entertain her - she's thinking about herself and not you and your needs. Your reasons not to go make a lot of sense. \n\nFrankly 10 days trapped on a cruise when you had other important people to see and things you need to do sounds awful.", "NTA.  You will have to handle a lifetime of regret if something happens to your family and you choose a cruise over them (spoken from sad experience, and it was only a weekend away).  While I understand her motivation for wanting you with her, she's being selfish.  If she doesn't appreciate your need to connect with your family, she shouldn't be your girlfriend for long because more than likely this will be an ongoing behavior.  Why not ask her to go with you?  I doubt she will, but at least it will give her a point of reference for how it feels to be asked to miss out on important family time.", "NTA, and, in your heart, you know you're NTA as well. You seem like a logical person and you have solid reasons for not being able to go on the trip. My advice would be not to pander to your gf getting overly emotional that you're not going purely for (what it seems to be) social reasons (ie her sister's bf going on the trip and not you). You are not in the wrong, in any way. Good for you taking value in your family and considering all of the factors you listed.", "NAH. Cruises aren't everyone's cup of tea and you several additional valid reasons for not wanting to go. Of course your girlfriend is disappointed,  but she will probably get over it.", "NTA.  You should invite you girlfriend to see you family!", "Nta. It also depends on how intense your relationship  with her is. If she is the one , you may damage it irreparably as she feels you should be doing family things. Then there is the view that last spring break is the last time to let loose and hook up randomly. Could this be your plan?", "NTA. Your reasons are valid. She just doesn\u2019t want to be the fifth wheel with her siblings. That doesn\u2019t make you an AH", "NTA.   It's ok for your girlfriend to be sad that you're not there and understandable that she wishes that you could be there.  At the same time, you had originally intended that time to be spent with your family and friends and would happily take a raincheck for another trip.", "NTA", "NTA, if they go on a cruise every year and y'all have a break together then why not ask her to do a special short trip locally?\nLook up some romantic and fun places and show them to her", "NTA. Your reasons are all sensible. \n\nShe doesn't really have the right to be mad about it. Mild ta on her.", "NAH. I think you are being reasonable and her being upset is also understandable as long as she does about it in a healthy way.", "NAH, cruises aren't for everyone.", "NAH I can understand her being disappointed, but you have very valid reasons for not going, especially since you want to go visit your own family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If your girlfriend or anyone else keeps pushing you on it, explain that you have made plans to spend the break with your family & especially your grandmother.  You are correct that this may be your last chance for awhile to spend time at home with them, especially if you have a job lined up after graduation, and you deserve it.  \n\nAnd honestly, I'm with you on the cruise thing - being stuck on a huge, crowded ship with hundreds of strangers is not my idea of fun at all!  And even if you could afford your half of the fare, that doesn't include the extras & from what I've read, those add up really fast.", "NTA.  You are not her comfort animal.", "NAH. It's your choice.", "NAH. If you don\u2019t want to go, you shouldn\u2019t go. But it\u2019s also understandable that your girlfriend feels disappointed.", "NAH - enjoy your break and hopefully she will do the same.", "right. Im still trying to get confidence in my decision making. Im definitely a people pleaser", "I think shes just being reactionary since I made the decision a few hours ago and I definitely understand that. I also think that since I have trouble making my own decisions I let people influence how guilty I feel", "oh for sure, she just left from about a 10 day visit with me and my fam at home for winter break. I just dont know if my dad can keep paying for her flights so idk if it would work", "If this cause irreparable damage then they aren't meant for each other, or just aren't ready.", "Agree. I've been on one cruise and enjoyed it, glad I went, but I have no desire to do it again. I'd go if my husband really wanted us to do another one, but he's not enthusiastic about it either.", "You have every right to make your own decisions. She can be disappointed, but that's her issue to deal with, not yours to make her feel better. Stay strong.", "Yeah, just let her cool off a bit if it\u2019s only been a few hours. If she uses it to hold a grudge over you, then it\u2019s an issue. But you did absolutely nothing wrong, assuming you were respectful when you declined the invitation.", "If you were at Christmas with your parents I would personally go on the cruise but I understand where you are coming from.  Best of luck and hope she isn't too mad!", "The only cruise I would ever want to go on would be one of those European river cruises, and that ain't happening!  I'm definitely an introvert & do not like being in crowds.", "I could see maybe doing a blues cruise sometime.  Or maybe a whale watching cruise.  I doubt I will ever do either, though.", "NTA\n\nIs your GF jealous because she won't be able to show up her sister and her brother who will both be bringing SO? Just a possibility. Be attentive (see her off at the airport or seaport, text her a short note daily) so that even though you aren't there, she can still 'share' you with her sister and brother.\n\nI hope that makes sense to you.", "She doesn\u2019t have to go either.  Has she considered that?", "Is it an invitation or a summons? \n\nNTA, go visit your family.", "NTA. \n\nI got funding to go to a conference in the UK last summer and decided to extend my stay to 12 days to take a vacation before my fall grad school semester started up again. I invited my parents to come visit for a week of my trip after my conference because I live far away from them and never get to spend time with them and they were looking for an excuse for a vacation. Anywho, my parents offered to pay for the lodging and meals while they were there, including for my partner of 3 years if he came along too. He would still have to pay for his plane ticket which wasn\u2019t cheap and he\u2019s also a grad student so we don\u2019t have a ton of extra cash. \n\nWhen he decided NOT to go I was definitely disappointed because I thought it would be so much more fun if he came along and so much of the trip would be paid for, but I understood that it was still too expensive for him and he also has his grad dissertation to work on. Ultimately, I got over my disappointment and still had fun with my parents. \n\nAll this to say, that your gf should eventually get over it and respect your decision. If she (or her family) does not, then these are large red flags.", "Your reasons for not going are FAR stronger than \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d! Your gf has a right to be disappointed, but it would be very unfair for her to pressure you in the face of rare and precious family time, homework, and an old promise. \nShe\u2019ll miss you, and sometimes feel like a fifth wheel. That would suck if you were blowing her off for no reason, but you don\u2019t have to sacrifice yourself to avoid her having negative feelings."]}
