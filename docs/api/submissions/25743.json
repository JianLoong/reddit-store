I would quite literally leave a man over this. He isn't gonna change, he will just get better at hiding it from you. What if your child finds his piss bottles?He does this in the nursery and kids are known for touching things and putting their finger and objects in their mouth.

I recommend shining a blacklight all over the rooms your husband has been in. \n\nLike someone else said, I doubt there is only pee in those bottles. \n\nWhat your husband is doing is absolutely disgusting and unhygienic.", "Definitely NTA and your husband is acting super immature and lazy. Along with what everyone else has said, the habit clearly started and continued. It\u2019s super unhygienic and I\u2019d be concerned about him getting up with the baby at night after just getting piss all over his hands and then trying to handle the baby. I\u2019d have a very serious conversation with him about your boundaries and let him know that if this behavior continues, you will (not be in the relationship, or whatever else)\u2026 you can\u2019t control what he will do, but you can control your reaction and establish clear boundaries for yourself.", "NTA. Since you've categorically stated that it is not at all beneficial to you for him to be doing this, and that you hate it, it may be time to start brainstorming some more radical ways to put a stop to it.\n\n* Hide / throw out all bottles. If he's doing this out of laziness, he might be too lazy to get hold of a bottle, and thus get out the habit. But likely it'll just start up again when you stop going through the hassle of strict bottle disposal, so this probably won't work.\n* Tell him that if he thinks it's acceptable to pee all over his child's nursery then he can fucking well move back in with his mother and ask her to wipe up his piss, because you certainly didn't sign up to do that for him (at least, barring any medical reasons down the line I guess). You could threaten to ask her what she thinks about this.\n* Cut holes in all empty bottles. There'll be one mess - which he will have to clean up, on pain of castration - and then tell him that you will be doing this to all bottles going forward. And that if he gets a single drop of urine anywhere not in the bathroom going forward then he needs to start wearing diapers until he's potty trained again.\n* Tell him that you are going to tell on him to his friends. And then follow through if he doesn't stop. Shame might be the only thing that works. It seems he doesn't care that you think he's absolutely disgusting.", "NTA. Your husband is disgusting and I feel so sorry that your having to deal with this animal behaviour. Its just pure laziness and I really hope he gets his act together before your baby comes.", "NTA. Honestly this is beyond inappropriate, and if he can\u2019t respect your request to change his habits you should seriously examine the relationship. Not only does this mean he\u2019s not washing his hands, he\u2019s likely also not managing 100% accuracy. It\u2019s a cleanliness problems for sure. But it\u2019s also a respect issue. You\u2019ve asked him not to do this- yet he\u2019s claiming he does it so YOU don\u2019t wake up. Something doesn\u2019t add up with that- this isn\u2019t about ensuring you can sleep. This is either some gross fetish, a control issue of forcing his way on you, or some other larger problem. \n\nI\u2019d recommend couples therapy to have a third party mediate the conversation- he\u2019s not respecting your request, and that translates to a much much larger problem moving forward.", "You are so nice.

Then, realized how young he is & either way-it's really disgusting ! If you've already asked him not to do it -& he refuses to oblige -then maybe try taking the bottles Out of the House .

Does he have any hoarder tendencies? This is common among hoarders, sadly.\n\nI don't know why people do this, but trust me, there are accidents and spills. It feels a lot like a mental disorder, to be honest.\n\nMy MIL was peeing into cans and wastebaskets, and when she moved into senior housing we spent $800 trying to clean the overpowering odor out of the carpet, and ultimately had to replace all the carpeting and seal the subfloor.

I wouldn\u2019t have had a child with him. First sign of a relapse it would be ultimatum time. Stop or I leave. And I get the feeling your husband wouldn\u2019t stop. Document it all. With photos.

Sounds harsh but that\u2019s SUPER gross and he has no excuse.", "This is so nasty. Peeing in a bottle is like last resort shit. If your dogs are an issue, maybe send them to training - it will cost some money but, if it ends this behavior and saves your marriage it\u2019s worth it. We sent our pup to training and would do it all over again. So sorry you\u2019re dealing with this I would flip.", "NTA. Does he have some sort of pee fetish? Does he enjoy lining up his piss bottles like trophies of his nightly accomplishments? He must have amazing night vision to accurately piss in a bottle in the dark.  \n\nDoes he have some sort of bladder/incontinence issues? Why is he up to pee several times per night? Healthy adults can usually sleep through the night without having to get up. That is, assuming they go before bed.  I would think he'd be embarrassed about it. He seems to be feeling a bit entitled to have piss bottles around like they're a decorative choice. What happens when the baby is crawling and puts everything in their mouth?

If he had to go out of his way to get bottles maybe he would give up?\n\nEven if he keeps crates of beer bottles to drink later, I would smash the whole lot of them, out of anger/spite and to deprive him of a future supply. Do this a few times and maybe he will get the message just how angry you are and what a disgusting turd he is. The time for polite requests has long gone.\n\nCould you not speak to social services, health authorities, a psychotherapist - surely he's violating some health code.

I\u2019m just not generally a big fan of the \u201cyour genitals are a shameful source of filth and germs\u201d notion like this other commenter seems to have in his head. I wasn\u2019t only talking about masturbation.\n\nAdjusting where your dick and balls are laying in the middle of the night without scrubbing your hand after doesn\u2019t make you a disgusting person.", "That's just nit picking. Let's deal with facts.\n\nHe's peeing in bottles.\n\nIt's gross.\n\nShe's asked him not to pee in bottles.\n\nHe said he's doing it \"for her\" (?)\n\nHe's still doing it.\n\nOP is only the AH if she's locked him out of the bathroom so he can't go in there and is complaining about the results.\n\nShe was clear.\n\nShe's a pregnant woman, probably with a heightened sense of smell (very common amongst pregnant people), which means that gross pee is affecting her even more.\n\nThere are times in life where it's OK to not have a reason other than \"I don't like it\", and this is one of those times.\n\nTo say otherwise is trolling or just arguing for the sake of it.", "Yeah but that can be done over top the pants, not actually coming in contact with the bare skin and germs. Well I hope he\u2019s not jerking it as well and still not getting up to clean.", "You\u2019re definitely wrong about that but uh, maybe all the males you\u2019ll ever interact with don\u2019t ever touch their genitals at night if that\u2019s more comfortable to believe?\n\nI understand there\u2019s a different bacteria environment in peoples always clothes crotches but you also understand for men that regularly bath they\u2019re also probably one of the cleanest areas on their body right? Lol", "Nah this sounds like a you thing dude. I\u2019ve never put my hand inside my underwear to scratch or adjust my own genitals at night. There\u2019s no point. Why would I potentially dirty up my hand when I can just do that with my pants on. Why is your hand going in to touch it bare? Natural resting distance? Uh no that\u2019s digging your arm down into your pants and underwear \ud83d\ude43"]}
