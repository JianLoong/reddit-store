She can either fit in your clothes or she can not.\n\nSeems simple to me without all the emotional baggage your room-mate is now attaching to the issue.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't even suggest she lose weight. You merely pointed out that at her current weight, you were no longer comfortable with her wearing certain items.\n\nShe can't deflect whatever shame or embarrassment she feels and reinterpret it as you being hostile. Either she loses the weight and asks if you're cool returning to the status quo, or she wears other clothes.", "NTA. You didn't call her fat. You simply pointed out that she no longer fits in your clothes. For all we know, you could be a size 00 and she could now be a 2, but your clothes still aren't going to fit her anymore.", "You\u2019re not the asshole. You\u2019re the boundary creator, which gets easily mistaken as the asshole. Some people can\u2019t deal with reality, and gaining a considerable amount of weight can be a difficult thing to accept. I would address her and reiterate your love and support for her. But also ask her to address her feelings with you personally instead of everyone else, slandering your character. Real friends don\u2019t do that. She\u2019s getting fat and you let her down easy while trying to keep your clothes looking fresh. You\u2019re good!!", "NTA\n\nIts not shaming by asking someone nicely to not wear your clothes anymore so they don't get ruined. \n\nTell her to fucking get over it.", "INFO- do you borrow her clothes? If so, stop doing that. New policy, everybody just wears their own clothes.", "NAH\n\nYou don't have to blend her clothes and she doesn't need to be called fat which you did insinuate. At the same time, she doesn't need to lend you any of her own clothes.", "NAH, but seriously: Learn to tell a better white lie, willya?  And own up to the fact that you DID basically call her fat.", "YTA. There's this thing called 'tact' and you currently have absolutely none. All you had to say was 'I'm not comfortable with us sharing clothing anymore'. End of story. \n\nHow would you feel if she came up to you and said \"I don't want to share clothes because you're musty\"? You don't have to be rude for the sake of being rude.", "ESH\n\nThis is the issue you run into once you open the door for \"what's mine is yours\" in any relationship. If she came to you now for the first time it would be easy to make an excuse for her not to borrow your clothes but now, socially at least, you have to justify it. \n\nShe's an asshole for not appreciating the favor you were doing for her by letting her borrow your clothes up until now. But by the sounds of it you led with \"you're too fat now\" instead of simply saying \"no\" or saying anything else. \n\nDepending on where you come from it may be seen as more impolite to lie than to tell someone they've gained weight. If I was in your shoes (which I'd definitely stretch) I'd just tell her that I don't want my clothes being worn out twice as much anymore because I'm the one who has to replace them. Some people would say that's worse than telling the truth though so who can say.", "NTA   \n\n\nYou gave her your reason and it was already good enough from the start point. You weren't commenting on her weight, you were commenting on the state of your clothes. I used to borrow/lend everything from my roommate too, and once she told me she was starting to notice I stretch her tops that were tighter (I have bigger breasts than hers), and I apologized and said I would not borrow these items anymore. That was the end of it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHOWEVER, that trying on the skirt thing seems very off to me. It's not clear to me if it was your idea or hers, but there was no need for a test to be held. The point was that you had a limit and she wasn't accepting it, but that try-on sounds like an uncomfortable, unnecessary and stressful event.  If it were me, I wouldn't have gotten into a debate, if she's not accepting my limits, that's on her.  Prolonging the debate led you to say something harmful to her, which even if it's true, it's not okay to say. Rubbing your opinion in her face on why she's acting like that, especially when it can be a tricky thing to accept for a woman with the social pressure we have to look a certain way, is shitty. I would only state my opinion when the other person seems open to listen to it or asked for it, which is not the case in a discussion like yours. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope you two manage to talk it out!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So, she took her frustrations out on you rather than admitting that yes, she has gained weight and accepting her new body or choosing a course of action to reclaim her previous figure.\n\nNever lie to someone. The lie is always found out. If you\u2019d said you just didn\u2019t want to swap clothes anymore because of the wear or cost, you\u2019re then locking yourself into *never* doing that with anyone else as long as she\u2019s around because she\u2019ll notice immediately. Don\u2019t back yourself into unnecessary corners just to sugarcoat someone\u2019s feelings.", "NTA. What you've said to \"soften the blow\" probably came off as patronizing or rude to her, but still - you don't want your clothes to be stretched or damaged, she doesn't have to like it, but she has to accept that.", "Agreed, stop doing this. It only causes issues. Esp if something gets damaged.", "Yes I still borrow hers sometimes because she hasn't bought newer clothes her size yet and they still fit me because she used to be 1 or 2 sizes bigger", "I'm so over people claiming someone is an asshole for stating a fact.\n\nHer roommate asked why she couldn't wear the clothes anymore, what was OP supposed to do, lie? Let her ruin her clothes?", "So you think its better for OP to lie then be honest with her roommate. What on earth could have OP used as another reason why she no longer wanted her friend wearing her clothes?", "This is always a no-win conversation. If you\u2019re honest with the person (\u201cyou\u2019re stretching my clothes\u201d) suddenly you\u2019re hateful and fatphobic. If you make up an excuse everyone knows you\u2019re lying and think you\u2019re too cowardly to \u201cadmit\u201d that you hate larger people when in reality you just don\u2019t want any more clothing ruined, and when someone is a larger size than you, they ruin clothing by wearing it. That\u2019s a fact. Bigger people need bigger clothes. A basic concept and apparently a horrible one to vocalize these days.", "wtf and what is her roommate supposed to think after hearing \"I am not comfortable with us sharing clothes anymore\" ?????\n\nDo you really think her friend wouldn't ask why she is no longer comfortable? Then what lie should she come up with next to protect this person's feelings?", "I didn't know that she wasn't aware of her weight gain so I casually mentioned it being the reason. I was better off making a different excuse but not sure what else could have been said.", "Meh. Would be nice if you stopped", "Honestly, I\u2019d stop borrowing her clothes immediately. If you\u2019re setting limits for her but still taking from her as you please, that\u2019s AH behavior. \n\nTo me, it sounds like it\u2019s not just about the fit\u2014she wanted to still participate in the tradition of sharing clothes with you. The way you said it does sound hurtful, but I understand where you\u2019re coming from.", "You really need to stop borrowing her clothes - that\u2019s adding insult to injury.", "Umm. That has to stop. Even if you\u2019re choosing pieces she no longer wears, surely you can see how that will add to her being upset.", "Stop borrowing her clothes.", "Weight is a tricky topic nowadays since historically people have and still are cruel to anyone overweight. Again it's regional but in my neck of the woods it would be an insult to bring up someone's weight gain despite it being a matter of fact. \n\nThis is more about tact than it is about being or not being an asshole. Of course you're within your rights to prevent someone from wearing your clothes but it sounds like you're trying to be respectful of your roommate's feelings.\n\nAt the heart of this your concern isn't for their weight, it's for your clothes being ruined. So lead with that instead and let her decide whether she'll continue to make a fuss or not. Put your foot down and say that until you say otherwise she simply cannot use your belongings the way she used to. If she continues to object you can rest assured that she's in the wrong and not you."]}
