Every girlfriend he has had since our divorce, he has flaunted in front of me with. He has gone out of his way to \u201cswing by\u201d my work with them, handed them the phone while I was on it talking to him while he \u201cwent to the bathroom\u201d, etc. He only comes to my daughter\u2019s games and events with a girlfriend, and comes to nothing when he is in between girlfriends. \n\nSome people would think I need to \u201cget over it and move on\u201d, but it makes me very uncomfortable to see him with these women after what I witnessed in my marriage, and knowing he is showing off.

He told me to grow up and get over it, and a slew of other typical narcissistic insults. \n\nI really do not want her in my house for 5 reasons: \n1) I am not over the cheating.

I am afraid something is going to be said that will cause drama if he brings a girlfriend. \n3) His girlfriend knows no one at the party and doesn\u2019t know my daughter other than a 30 second exchange. \n4) He is doing this to show off and hurt me. \n5) The last is I actually don\u2019t want this girl to be put in an awkward situation.  \n\nSo I am prepared to message her if he continues to insists on bringing her and explaining these reasons to her in an attempt that hopefully she will not want to come.

They sense the hurt and animosity. It stresses them out!) Don\u2019t ever let him in your house again. Once all your kids are 18 block his number. You don\u2019t have to be in the same room as him again until she gets married, graduates from college or is giving birth. Those kind of things. Your co parenting days are over.", "NTA. I would suggest asking your daughter, but unless she says she really wants her there, just let him know that this is family, and frankly his flavor of the week isn't necessary. This is yours and your daughters house, you both have every right to be happy, comfortable and safe there. He is trying to take that away. You don't owe it to either of them to allow them there.

I just don\u2019t want her in the middle and have him go after her like he does me :( I appreciate the support!", "Agree. She is an adult, not a child. Explain it to her and she should be able to understand and empathize. But I also don\u2019t think you need to sacrifice your comfort in your home for your adult kid. Simple boundary of no brand new girlfriends. That isn\u2019t really appropriate even if your divorce was amicable. You aren\u2019t being petty- he is just pissed he doesn\u2019t get to torture you mentally. You are ruining is sadistic little game. Honestly you are under no obligation to include him let alone the girlfriend.", "I didn\u2019t seek child support to avoid getting into a custody battle with him. He was out running around with different women and not being a dad anyway. I bargained with him to not go after him for child support in exchange for no formal custody arrangements and leaving it up to my daughter how much time she wanted to spend and where as I did not want to force her to visit with either one of us if she did not want to. He never has even asked her to come over more than once or twice a month, and she usually turns him down. It\u2019s a sad situation in general because a child should have a relationship with both parents, but it cannot be forced. The money is tight but she is in a stable place with me. That was worth more to me than child support :) I hope that makes sense though I know it\u2019s not conventional.", "My daughter doesn\u2019t know her at all. After reading the feedback, it sounds like I need to talk to her about this.", "Or plan his own party for his daughter's birthday!", "Great advice! Thank you!", "Awww! Thanks so much for that!", "I love this but I would not be able to follow this through :(", "Part of me so wants to do this to help her out, but it also may just help reinforce I\u2019m his \u201ccrazy\u201d ex. So far, his girlfriends have caught on pretty quickly and left him.", "I agree which is why I have not sent anything and wanted outside opinions. Thanks!", "I can see your point, thank you for your feedback. My daughter has voiced discomfort with being around her dad when he has girlfriends present. When she has refused to stay with her dad due to this, he gives her a hard time. I have stayed out of it as she is pretty good about standing up for herself, something I struggled with. Since this party is at my house and she has voiced previous concerns, I struggle with putting her in another tough position, that\u2019s why I\u2019m not sure what to do. She wants this huge party with all the family on both sides there, so I am trying to accommodate her wishes. The only issue is this girlfriend. I suppose if the girlfriend comes, my ex looks like the a**hole, not me.", "I agree. I have not asked her because I am afraid to put her in the middle, but it may be what is best after all.", "I see your point and appreciate your feedback.

Based on the feedback, it sounds like I need to have a conversation with my daughter about that.", "I always invite him to everything as he is her father. He just never comes.", "I see your point you gave and appreciate the feedback. This is why I posted here to get an outside perspective. I did not seek child support to avoid a drawn out custody battle as he wanted to fight me to the death. I chose to bargain with him that if we could stay out of court it would be my daughter\u2019s decision on who she wanted to be with and who she wanted to spend time with. It\u2019s unconventional, but it allowed my daughter and him to be responsible for their own relationship rather than her being forced to visit when she was not ok with him being with his mistress who treated her awful at the time of the divorce. I felt this was better protection for my daughter if that makes sense?", "I see your point and agree that girlfriend is not the problem here at all. I just am trying to avoid issues but may be possibly creating more. I appreciate the feedback!", "Literally her party at her house.", "My concern as well!", "I see your point.

If he complains about it not being as big a celebration, tell him that if he really cares about his girlfriend that much, then it is actually better if he does this, because this way she'll get more personal time with your daughter to get to know her properly and so will he, and she won't be in an environment where she doesn't know anyone else and your daughter would rather talk to her friends or other family than her.\n\nTell him that if he would rather just come to your celebration, then he can come alone.", "You never have to tell your XH it was actually your decision if your daughter decides she doesn\u2019t want her there.

That being said I would suggest discussing it with your daughter. Explaining your reasons, and why you feel how you do. Also explaining to her that you don't want her caught in the middle. But you did want to inform her of your decision. (Partly because if \"father\" drops out of coming he won't be able to turn it on you by saying. \"Your mother said X couldn't come and so I felt unwelcome.\") \n\nI would also suggest if you aren't doing so that you look into therapy. You are carrying a heavy weight from the mistreatment and subsequent shenanigans he has brought to your life. Speaking with a professional might help you move past some of it, it'll be hard work, but it would be nice to put that weight down for awhile and just be able to take a breath. \n\nEither way, I hope the party goes well, and you get to enjoy time with friends & family \u270c\ufe0f", "TBH, I\u2019d ask your daughter if she wants HIM there, let alone his gf.

My bet, he bails on that.", "I think you\u2019re on to something!", "It is unconventional that I requested no child support. I did this because he was threatening a huge battle with me. I made a deal with him that if we did no child support and equal custody, that our daughter, who was almost 16, would choose when and where she wanted to be. The woman he was with at the time of the divorce was very mean to my daughter and had moved in with him. My daughter was very uncomfortable around her and did not want to be with her dad when she was around. I did not want to force her into having to be over there. So this was a win for him that he did not owe any money, and a win for my daughter that she chooses if she wants to go over there. I have never stopped her when she has gone to spend time with him, and she is not there often. But it has been her choice and he has been responsible for their relationship. I feel that was so much more worth anything money can buy. Money is tight, but she has what she needs and the bills are paid :)", "She may choose to have your ex's girlfriend there if that's what it takes to have her dad at her party, and unfortunately, you'll just have to deal with that. There is a good chance she's noticed him flaunting his girlfriends and thinks it's as cringy as it is, but also, she may not have noticed because she has other things going on. \n\nIf your ex is saying these horrible things to your face, there's every chance he's saying it to her as well. I know somebody whose ex used to bad-mouth her to their kids but surrounded it in words that made him look like less of a bad dude, like \"I know your mother is crazy, but you should just humour her about this, because we know what she's like\" when she was asking something very reasonable, and the like. Staying respectful, but opening up conversations about these sort of things might help counter whatever he's saying (being very careful to stay respectful so she doesn't think you're just being bitter).", "See if you can file for past child support now that she's 18.\n\nSeriously, talk to a lawyer.", "It sounds like XH manipulated you into getting what he wanted.", "Custody is based on the best interests of the child and at 16 your daughter is old enough the judge would listen to her.

You should\u2019ve gotten child support. It\u2019s a legal obligation and it could\u2019ve been put towards college.
