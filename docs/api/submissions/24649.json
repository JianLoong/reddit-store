An event I\u2019ve been excited and dreading at the same time for years, because I\u2019ve always had a cloud looming over me about this subject. My father has been having a feud with my uncle (mother\u2019s brother) for years, since I was little. I don\u2019t know the specifics, but basically my father said that my uncle does\u2019t exist for him and that this feud will end when one of them is dead. Very dramatic, but my father tends to be resentful. The thing is - my uncle has been a great uncle for me and my sister. He left this event behind him, apparently apologised and doesn\u2019t hold any grudges against my father. He never speaks ill of my father and respects him.\n\nAll this culminated when my sister was getting married years ago. My father dropped the bomb on my sister by saying that he doesn\u2019t want our uncle to come to her wedding and that if he comes, he will not attend. My sister was understandably shocked and suffered over this. She ended up however giving in and pleased my father by uninviting our uncle. From what I recall, she said that she is choosing our father over our uncle. He was really heartbroken, but understood. He has never come to any family event that was directly linked to my sister and I.\n\nMy relationship with my father is complicated. I won\u2019t get into much detail, but some years ago, after my sister\u2019s wedding, he told me the same thing will happen to me as well. And I told him that this means both of us will have to live with our decision, implying I will not follow my sister\u2019s example. But still, this has been haunting me and I cannot enjoy this time in my life because of it (alongside other reasons). I asked my mother if my father brought up this subject with her, hoping that he had a change of heart. She said he didn\u2019t mention it, but she is sure that he will not change his mind. I will bring this up to him so I know where we stand.\n\nI have lots of thoughts about this. I cannot comprehend how a parent can even consider not coming voluntarily to his child\u2019s wedding, no matter the reason. My mother said that if he sees that I am doing this in his spite, he might do some things in spite as well. This just blows my mind. Maybe from the outside the solution is obvious: just don\u2019t invite your uncle, what is the big issue? The big issue for me is that he\u2019s been getting away with this behaviour for too long and got accustomed to people accommodating his wishes. Who puts their child in the position to choose like this? On such a big occasion? This shows me that his pride is more important to him than me, than seeing me a bride, than being at my wedding, etc. A parent should seek to make their child\u2019s life easier, not harder. Why should I be the one, again, to compromise, just because I am the child? This would by the last straw for me.\n\nIf you got this far, thank you for reading.", "created_utc": 1692037994, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15r2vry/wibta_if_i_dont_respect_by_fathers_wish_and_he/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hugs.", "NTA. \nAnyone who refuses to come to your wedding because they have beef with another family member cares more about their grudge than they do celebrating your happiness. \nYour uncle, it sounds like, is a grown adult who knows how to move on with life while your father does not. You shouldn't punish one relative because the other is petty and passive aggressive. Your father doesn't care that he's making your day about him. He doesn't care that the emotional manipulation has engaged in hurts his own child.\nInvite people who love and support you and if your father can't be an adult for one day, then it's clear he values pettiness over his child's happiness.", "Can't answer without knowing the details. If the Uncle did something truly unforgivable...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think you need a heart to heart with your Dad. Insist he tell you what happened.", "NTA.  Your father is resorting to emotional blackmail for something that happened the details of which you are not privy to.  It may be his decision to not-go to your and/or to your sister's weddings.  But that is his decision.  Neither of you is responsible for his decisions.", "Info - I dont like ultimatums, so I dont appreciate your father putting you in that position. However, I think we and you need to know why your father hates your uncle so much. What happened? Is he in anyway justified for not wanting anything to do with him?", "NTA - Your Dad wont tell you why he hates your Uncle and you have to take it on good faith that he is being reasonable about it.  That alone isn't fair to you.  In additional, he is making you choose between the two of them.  He can act like an adult for a day and sit on the other side of the room and enjoy your wedding.  If it was me, I'd send invites to both and if HE chooses to not come then I'd just cut contact since my wedding wasn't important enough to him to attend.", "The only AH here is your father. \n\nHe\u2019s choosing his hatred for your uncle over the love he has for you.", "NTA.  DAD is the AH.  He chose the uncle over his own daughter.", "NTA. This is meant to be your special day, if you want your uncle there over your dad (who is a major AH) then have your uncle there", "Needs more info. What even happened between them?", "NTA. Invite them both and if your father throws down his ultimatum tell him that\u2019s fine because your uncle can walk you down the aisle.", "NTA. This is such a tough situation.\n\nHe is behaving in such a childish way. What, outside of child molestation, would cause such an unreasonable response?\n\nYou, btw, are not \"the child\", you're his adult daughter and he should treat you with the respect you deserve, you give him respect as your father, right?\n\nIt it were me, and if your father will not tell you the whys and wherefores, I'd invite both understanding he'll do as he chooses. This way his behavior is all on him.\n\nI'm sorry he's being so difficult. Unforgiveness is a terrible, terrible thing and he's suffering for it, as well as making everyone around him suffer too. As long as he fails to forgive his brother, he is shackled to the past keeping that pain alive. Unforgiveness never lets that wound heal, and he goes through life reminding himself of what was done to him, stirring up that pain and making himself progressively angrier. I only hope at some point he can understand this and figure out a way to forgive and let it go - for all your sakes.", "You never ever give in to ultimatums. What\u2019s next?  He won\u2019t meet your children if the uncle has, he won\u2019t come to see your new house because the uncle has, etc etc etc. \n\nYou invite those you want at your wedding. If your father chooses not to come, that is on him for making that choice. \n\nNTA", "Not sure what the question is directly - based on the title it sounds like \"would I be if I invited my uncle?\" \n\nIf that's the question then NTA - your father and your uncle are both adults and they'll have to deal with the consequences of their actions. You invite the people you want to your wedding and if they don't like each other that's _their_ problem.", "NTA  \nYour dad can hold his grudge, but do not need to be a pawn in this. \n\nIf you love your uncle and would like him there, invite him. Your father is not being excluded by you - there will be consequences, and likely you will have no contact with your father if he is this hostile. You need to weigh if this is worth losing your relationship with your father, and severely impacting the relationship with your mother.\n\nIf you choose to invite your uncle, be prepared and let your dad know how much you love him, and you want him there but that you are not willing to continue this grudge for your future family. Your wedding is a place of love and support, and those who have aided you in life are welcome - and that you want your dad there. You want him there, but if he hates his brother more than he loves you, that his *his choice*.", "YWNBTA, and you are spot on with your thinking.\n\nYour father is TA for extending his resentment to you and your sister, and you are right that it grates the wrong way that he should get away with it.\n\nIf you invite your uncle, you will not be TA, on the contrary.", "INFO: what about your mother's events like birthday's? she never invites her own brother because of your father?", "NTA but your father definitely is. You are completely right that it's awful to miss your child's wedding over something like this.\n\nIt's extremely immature to act like this. You could still invite your uncle and your father and he can just choose what he wants to do. \n\nAlso, we don't know why your father hates your uncle but if it is so so bad that he still hates him after all these years then why wouldn'The tell you the specifics about the situation? Because of this I assume that your father's hatred might be unjustified.", "Do you know the reason for the estrangement? Did your uncle harm your dad, mom, sister, cousins, or someone? There are certain circumstances I would cut off a family member for and not be in the same room with them, but if your dad is doing it for something petty, then call his bluff.", "NTA, unless his reason is both very legitimate and something he feels is too shameful to share. If it's just \"he owes me money,\" that's his problem, not yours. But if your uncle abused him in some way and now lives freely knowing your dad iwll never say anything, or won't be believed, that's a different story entirely. But i'd want to know more for sure.", "NTA - your father is acting like a defiant toddler.  Your wedding, your choice.", "You dad is an ah for putting this on you. It sounds like uncle is more of a dad than dad is. Why would you disinvite him? Is dad kicking money in for your wedding? \n\n>Maybe from the outside the solution is obvious: just don\u2019t invite your uncle\nI am not in your shoes, but I think you should switch your dad and uncle.", "Your father sounds pathetic NGL. He can\u2019t overlook his own feelings for one day to make either of his daughters happy? What a worthless person.", "Definitely NTA\n\nMy advice would be for you to be the one to give your father the ultimatum.\n\nHe can either be apart of your wedding and ignore the fact that your uncle is there, or he doesn't have to come.\n\nI would let both sides (father/uncle) know that they are only allowed to come if they avoid the other tho. (Might ease tensions)\n\nWhatever you choose to do is completely your choice. Weddings are stressful enough without grown adults refusing to put aside their feelings for a family member or friends big day. If he won't respect your choice and is likely to make a scene at the wedding because of it, that's toxic and too much added stress for you to deal with.\n\nJust remember it's yours and your partners day, not his.", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInvite both, and leth THEM sort it out.
