An event I\u2019ve been excited and dreading at the same time for years, because I\u2019ve always had a cloud looming over me about this subject. My father has been having a feud with my uncle (mother\u2019s brother) for years, since I was little. I don\u2019t know the specifics, but basically my father said that my uncle does\u2019t exist for him and that this feud will end when one of them is dead. Very dramatic, but my father tends to be resentful. The thing is - my uncle has been a great uncle for me and my sister. He left this event behind him, apparently apologised and doesn\u2019t hold any grudges against my father. He never speaks ill of my father and respects him.\n\nAll this culminated when my sister was getting married years ago. My father dropped the bomb on my sister by saying that he doesn\u2019t want our uncle to come to her wedding and that if he comes, he will not attend. My sister was understandably shocked and suffered over this. She ended up however giving in and pleased my father by uninviting our uncle. From what I recall, she said that she is choosing our father over our uncle. He was really heartbroken, but understood. He has never come to any family event that was directly linked to my sister and I.\n\nMy relationship with my father is complicated. I won\u2019t get into much detail, but some years ago, after my sister\u2019s wedding, he told me the same thing will happen to me as well. And I told him that this means both of us will have to live with our decision, implying I will not follow my sister\u2019s example. But still, this has been haunting me and I cannot enjoy this time in my life because of it (alongside other reasons). I asked my mother if my father brought up this subject with her, hoping that he had a change of heart. She said he didn\u2019t mention it, but she is sure that he will not change his mind. I will bring this up to him so I know where we stand.\n\nI have lots of thoughts about this. I cannot comprehend how a parent can even consider not coming voluntarily to his child\u2019s wedding, no matter the reason. My mother said that if he sees that I am doing this in his spite, he might do some things in spite as well. This just blows my mind. Maybe from the outside the solution is obvious: just don\u2019t invite your uncle, what is the big issue? The big issue for me is that he\u2019s been getting away with this behaviour for too long and got accustomed to people accommodating his wishes. Who puts their child in the position to choose like this? On such a big occasion? This shows me that his pride is more important to him than me, than seeing me a bride, than being at my wedding, etc. A parent should seek to make their child\u2019s life easier, not harder. Why should I be the one, again, to compromise, just because I am the child? This would by the last straw for me.\n\nIf you got this far, thank you for reading.", "created_utc": 1692037994, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15r2vry/wibta_if_i_dont_respect_by_fathers_wish_and_he/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, I think we and you need to know why your father hates your uncle so much. What happened? Is he in anyway justified for not wanting anything to do with him?", "NTA - Your Dad wont tell you why he hates your Uncle and you have to take it on good faith that he is being reasonable about it.  That alone isn't fair to you.  In additional, he is making you choose between the two of them.  He can act like an adult for a day and sit on the other side of the room and enjoy your wedding.  If it was me, I'd send invites to both and if HE chooses to not come then I'd just cut contact since my wedding wasn't important enough to him to attend.", "The only AH here is your father. \n\nHe\u2019s choosing his hatred for your uncle over the love he has for you.", "NTA.

This is such a tough situation.\n\nHe is behaving in such a childish way. What, outside of child molestation, would cause such an unreasonable response?\n\nYou, btw, are not \"the child\", you're his adult daughter and he should treat you with the respect you deserve, you give him respect as your father, right?\n\nIt it were me, and if your father will not tell you the whys and wherefores, I'd invite both understanding he'll do as he chooses. This way his behavior is all on him.\n\nI'm sorry he's being so difficult. Unforgiveness is a terrible, terrible thing and he's suffering for it, as well as making everyone around him suffer too. As long as he fails to forgive his brother, he is shackled to the past keeping that pain alive. Unforgiveness never lets that wound heal, and he goes through life reminding himself of what was done to him, stirring up that pain and making himself progressively angrier. I only hope at some point he can understand this and figure out a way to forgive and let it go - for all your sakes.", "You never ever give in to ultimatums. What\u2019s next?

You are completely right that it's awful to miss your child's wedding over something like this.\n\nIt's extremely immature to act like this.

Because of this I assume that your father's hatred might be unjustified.", "Do you know the reason for the estrangement? Did your uncle harm your dad, mom, sister, cousins, or someone?

He can\u2019t overlook his own feelings for one day to make either of his daughters happy?

Weddings are stressful enough without grown adults refusing to put aside their feelings for a family member or friends big day.

I am very concerned by your mother's words: were they an implied threat or a warning?  If you do invite your uncle, I would hire security for all events.

Also, an apology does not need to be accepted, especially if it is one of the many apologies that are halfassed and inauthentic and not genuine. \n\nWithout the context of what happened between them I can't judge, but I think it's ridiculous to think that your Uncle wrong your Father, but your Uncle put it all behind him, so it's all OK now because he's over it.
