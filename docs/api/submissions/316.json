Justin came into my life when my mom and dad had a messy divorce. My mom remarried a year after they divorced and married my stepdad, Brady and Brady has a son who is Justin.\n\nBrady is a jerk because he always yells at me when my mom isn't around but when my mom was around he acted like the world's greatest dad. I wanted to be Justin's friend but Justin was cold towards me and he acted rudely. And when I was 17 I figured out the reason Justin hated me, Brady had told him lies about me. So after I moved out at 18, we haven't spoken to each other again.\n\nHere's where the problem starts. One of my friends (17F) called Emily wanted to go to a party. I had a crush on Emily at the time and I wanted to go with her until I found out the host was Justin.  I decided to be polite and not be rude, so I found his phone number online and contacted him.\n\nI called asking if I could get an invite and he said no and hung up immediately. I was fuming with rage because I wanted to confess my feelings at the party, so I decided to show up anyway with Emily and as I was professing my love for her.  Justin locked eyes with me and started yelling at me for being an ass and showing up uninvited.\n\nI ended up ignoring him and continued to spend time with Emily but Justin ended up YELLING AT me and kicked me out. I left with Emily but Emily refused to go with me so I said \"WELL THEN YOU ARE NOT GETTING A RIDE HOME!!\"\n\nEmily and Justin aren't speaking to me,  and I regretted it deeply.\n\nAITA?\n\nUPDATE: I realize I am in the wrong. I apologized to both Emily and Justin, but Justin didn't forgive me. Whatever he is an ass anyways. Emily said that she did forgive me but she didn't have feelings for me at ALL. She said she never had feelings and strictly viewed me as a friend. I already had a date lined up for next week. I think it turned out well. Justin is such a fucking jerk. I don't know why I did all of this shit.\n\nTake care, Reddit users.", "created_utc": 1667247270, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yinkf2/aita_for_showing_up_to_my_stepbrothers_party/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You crashed *someone else's party* because (checks your excuse) you wanted to use *their* party as a platform to confess to *your* crush? \n\nNot to mention you *knew* the host of the party *actively* hated you, what did you expect would happen? \n\nYeah, your step-father and step-brother are assholes, but in **this situation** you're the asshole.\n\nRemember, AITA is for determining the asshole in a particular situation, it doesn't matter that they're **overall assholes**, in this instance *you dun goofed*", "YTA for showing up to a party that you were told specifically not to attend.  How you feel about Emily is completely beside the point.", "YTA\n\nHe told you not to come, so you did anyway. Then when you tried to leave with Emily (to a party she was invited to and wanted to attend) and she didn't want to leave, you yell at her. \n\nYeah, you blew it with Emily dude, sorry.", "YTA.  Wow.  Yeah, I'm sorry that your stepdad was a jerk to you growing up, that sucks, but the way you handled this whole thing was really immature.  Never go to a party that you weren't invited to.  Not only were you not invited, but you were specifically *un*invited.  I mean, why did you bother calling Justin at all if you were just going to do whatever you wanted?  Then you ditched your friend (who you supposedly have feelings for) at the party and left.  Well, dude, you just shot yourself in the foot with her.  Might as well get over your feelings.", "YTA \n\nYou\u2019re always the AH when you turn up where you\u2019re not wanted.", "YTA - Regardless of the reasons, your step brother told you specifically that you were not invited. You could have easily told Emily that as much as you'd like to go, you and your step brother are not on good terms and you'll have to pass. Not your party and you acted like an ass.", "YTA - you weren\u2019t invited. Don\u2019t go.", "YTA. This was all very immature and you say you regret it so you already know you were in the wrong. Don\u2019t turn up where you weren\u2019t invited, and don\u2019t leave someone without ensuring they have another way to get home.", "Everyone sucks in this situation but YTA for crashing the party. Honestly I have no idea why you'd even want to hang out near this kid or his dad for any reason whatsoever, potential for romance notwithstanding.\n\nYou set yourself up  for grief here. Stop doing that.", "Things that never happened for $500", "YTA- you called and asked and he said no\u2026 so you show up anyway? You really didn\u2019t think any of this through\u2026 soon as you said this, I knew the rest of your story before I read it. Even down to her reaction.\n\nFirst- if you found out that stepdad lied about you to stepbrother, first thing you should have done was talk with him. You may have had a chance at the party if you actually wanted to reconcile with him then just use him to put the moves on some girl. \n\nSecond- once you were told no, you should have explained that to her and see if you two could do something else together instead. If she turned you down, that says a lot about her interest in you, compared to your interest in her. \n\nThird- the need you felt to go to the party with her, and confess your feelings at the party sounds\u2026. Insecure and clingy. Admit it, you were scared that she would go and hook up with another guy, and you wanted her to take your confession, swoon over it and be seen in public that she is now your girl.\n\nForth- she already knew you weren\u2019t her ride home before you two even got to the party. She was planning her own \u201cride\u201d long before you were even going. All you did was give her and stepbro some common ground that maybe they were riding together\u2026 and she wouldn\u2019t leave till the next morning. \n\n\nThis is all on you dude. All your mistakes, live life, learn from your mistakes, and move one\u2026. Now go find a girl that will actually like you the way you like her.", "Um, yes, YTA. Sheesh.", "YTA. He said no. You going was just you wanting to do a pissing contest which you lost. You were just being a selfish asshole towards both of them. Pretty sure the actual child is more mature than you were.", "YTA\n\n>\"I decided to be polite and not be rude, so I found his phone number online and contacted him.  \n>  \n>I called asking if I could get an invite and he said no and hung up immediately.\"  \n>  \n>\"I left with Emily but Emily refused to go with me so I said \"WELL THEN YOU ARE NOT GETTING A RIDE HOME!!\"\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think you take rejections quite well OP.", "Don\u2019t worry dude\n\nIt\u2019ll come with age I promise, bet yeah YTA here", "YTA.

Why did you think it was a good idea to go anyway?\nYou could have just taken her on a date but no you had to play the AH.\n\nPS did you never told him about the lies?", "Info:\n\n**Was this party at your mom's house?**", "YTA for:\n\n* planning to tell a girl you like her at a big party\n* going to a party you specifically were told you were not invited to\n* acting like a jerk when you got kicked out of said party\n* yelling at Emily when every single thing that happened was a predictable result of your bad choices", "YTA. \n\nOP: *I was explicitly told I wasn't welcome somewhere but I went anyway and they called me an \\*ss. At first I ignored them and stayed, but then they actually kicked me out! I didn't do anything wrong, right?* \n\nUm, dude, where do we start? And you've permanently ruined any chance with Emily, in case you were still wondering.", "YTA. Why would you think it was ok to turn up to a party you're not invited to, especially if you're just using the party to profess your feelings for a girl?! Sorry that Justin doesn't get on with you but that's something for the two of you to maybe work on another day. Justin doesn't owe you anything, including his friendship.\n\nSo, to massively disrespect his answer because your brain is trapped in your underwear is a massive AH thing to do. Did Emily know you weren't invited? How humiliating for her to be stuck in the middle of your childish outburst. Well she's seen who you really are now and is probably glad she avoided a disaster.", "Unfortunately, I hate to say this, but YTA. I know you like Emily, but that was not the time and place to be with her. \n\nA few reasons for YTA:\n\n1) I\u2019m not sure it was the greatest idea to call him up and ask for an invite - if he had wanted you to be invited, he would have invited you. \n\n2) Then you had the audacity to show up to the party anyway and \n\n3) and THEN stay to hang out with Emily even after he told you to leave? \n\nThe ride home doesn\u2019t matter - she\u2019ll find her own ride home. You needed to get out of there when Justin told you to go. I\u2019m sorry, but yes, YTA.", "YTA without a doubt, you ignored his boundary about his party, then acted entitled to stay when he obviously didn't want you there, then pushed your friend to leave too, then shouted at her!", "YTA, it'd already be bad enough if you just showed up unannounced and got told to leave, but he explicitly told you that you weren't welcome at his house. Whether he hates you for valid reasons or not, you don't go where you're explicitly not wanted. \n\nSorry about the girl, but there would have been other chances. Much better chances than that, even. But now I dare say you have zero chances lol.", "YTA. Clueless much? I can see why Justin doesn't like you.", "YTA for showing up when you were told not to come and being a jerk to Emily. \n\nI also think the reasons for your bad relationship with your stepbrother go beyond something your stepdad said to him about you.", "YTA. You purposely went to a party you specifically were told you weren\u2019t invited to. You made things worse with your stepbrother and blew it with the girl you like.", "YTA. Regardless of your history with these awful people, you showed up to a party you weren't invited to AND thought THAT was a good time and place to profess your love to your crush??? Talk about bad timing dude. Next time go someplace you're wanted, I guarantee things will go better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't know what you were thinking in terms of a party to which you were not invited being the proper venue to confess your feelings to Emily.  And remember all those lies Brady told Justin?

You\u2019re not entitled to trespass on someone\u2019s property.", "YTA, you don't say anything about Justin's history and his mother nor his relationship with your mother. It's possible he just wasn't receptive to being part of a blended family and your overenthusiasm in getting an older brother reinforced his position. This incident with the party shows you don't recognise personal boundaries as much as you should. You had to look up his number online, that says everything. Despite saying you wanted to be polite you went anyway, when you were explicitly told No. You wanted an audience when you confessed your love (itself a huge red flag to wave), and wanted it to be at your stepbrother's party (gatecrashing just to make it happen). How do you not realise this is incredibly self-centered of you?", "YTA, obviously.", "yta", "Yeah of course YTA", "And profess his love. That's not something subtle, and that he desired this to be at an event he was specifically uninvited from (an uninvitation he received from a call where he had to the number online) shows major inability to read the room.", "Or OP wanted to use public pressure for her to say yes. A dirty move to be sure.", "Yeah all of that. YTA, op.", "Did OP ever get confirmation? I get feeling this is another case of a stepsibling who didn't get the hint the other sibling wasn't on board with the whole blended family thing but from the perspective of the oblivious one for a change.", "He had to internet search to get the number in the first place.", "Happy cake day!", "no clue, op never commented at all.\n\nI dont get why step dad would tell lies, there\u2019s gotta be something there", "Good point.", "Huh, I made this account on halloween? I didn't even know lol", "I've got theories which could explain why Justin was always cold to OP.
