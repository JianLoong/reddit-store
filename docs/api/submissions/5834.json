We have 3 kids, Lucas (9M), Andy (8M), and Claire (5F). Where Lucas and Andy are from our past relationships. However, Miles (my husband M37) has accepted Andy as his, and so did I (F35) Lucas. \n\nEvery Christmas is special for Andy, his bd is on Dec/24.  His dad started a tradition where Santa would've consideration with him for being a \"kid of Christmas\". So he feels magical and special. I always try to give him that. Last year, i left \"Santa Claus\" footsteps, ate a carrot and \"grass\" he left for Rudolf. Stuff like that. \n\nMy husband doesn't think it's a good idea i do all that for him, and I'm showing favoritism. So, we should shut it down, because of my ex's decision to create a tradition without considering my other kid's feelings. I disagree since i do consider the 3 of them. But he asked if we could so smth else, like the Elf on the shelf. I had no problem with it, but I didn't know how that works. He explained me quickly, and since he was the one who offered, i let him do it. \n\nWe bought the cute Elf. My kids named it \"Bob\". Later my husband explained them they should behave, and never touch/hold Bob if they don't want it to be naughty. At first, it was cute to see them spy on Bob, try to see it \"fly\" each night. Andy was the most excited of all, i found him one night talking with it, asking it if Santa still remembered him. \n\nBut my husband took seriously the \"Behave or Bob would be naughty\" part. Lucas was his first victim after he didn't do his chores. The next day, his face was drawn with sharpie markers. Then Claire, who touched Bob and her fave onesie was destroyed. Apparently, Bob had cut some pieces of it, while she was sleeping. Miles was having fun, but i could see my kids weren't. I talked to him about how we should lower the pranks, he agreed but wanted to catch Andy since he hadn't break any rules. I told him that Bob's supposed to tell Santa instead of being naughty. We argued but he finally agreed. \n\nFast forward, it's Christmas Eve and in the afternoon we had some of Andy's friends to celebrate his bd. So the kids were playing in backyard. But my husband looked sus. I decided to look for Bob. It was supposed to be in the kitchen but it wasn't there, I asked Miles where it was and he told me \"no idea\". I started getting paranoid, but Andy asked me if we could cut the cake already. I put my best face on and went for it. The cake was in a box, and when Andy opened the box. He starts crying. I take a look and it's ruined. \"Bob\" was covered in all of it, appearing he had been eating the cake. Half of the cake wasn't there anymore. Miles starts laughing and so did some of the other parents. \n\nMy blood is boiling and i grab Bob and throw it in the trash, Then i grabbed Miles. We have a terrible argument, calls me an AH for what i did to Bob, that I've ruined it, how are we supposed to keep the \"magic\" with our kids if i wasn't supposed to touch Bob.", "created_utc": 1672215428, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zx49l5/aita_for_throwing_away_the_elf_on_the_shelf_and/", "score": 13342, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband is hazing your children.", "NTA These are small children. You don't destroy their belongings in order to intimidate them into blind obedience, disguised as a 'joke'.  This is horrible. He is teaching them that if they make a mistake, or give into fantasy, their things will be destroyed, and their belongings aren't really theirs anyway.\n\nThat he took such enjoyment destroying your son's bday cake is sick, and I really believe that was the intention all along. I would strongly think over being married to someone like this.\n\nEdited to add: If you allow this behavior, you are setting up your son for a future in which his things will go missing/be destroyed, and his birthday treated like trash from this point onward, though it might be more disguised. Like there's an emergency every year on his bday so that it can't be celebrated.\n\nNotice, HIS son just had some marker drawn on his face. the daughter you share had a oneside destroyed, BUT KIDS GROW SUPER FAST AT THAT AGE, she was likely outgrowing it and ready for new ones shortly. The worst behavior was toward YOUR SON, that he had already accused of being the FAVORITE. Yeah there's a lot simmering under the surface with this.", "NTA\n\nHe ruined the birthday party with his juvenile and sadistic prank, as much as he most likely ruined the joyful and child-like spirit of the occasion for the two other kids with the other earlier stupid pranks.\n\nWhat a creepy and horrible Christmas \"tradition\" to traumatize your kids with. A doll that watches over them and exacts vengeance jfc", ">Then Claire, who touched Bob and her fave onesie was destroyed. Apparently, Bob had cut some pieces of it, while she was sleeping.\n\nI'm sorry, what in the ACTUAL FUCK is wrong with your husband? This is fucked up and sadistic. If he doesn't see what's wrong and express EXTREME remorse, idk how you can reconcile this. He's harming children. For fun. Does he experience empathy? You are NTA. These are pranks he would do in a frat house with teenagers, these are not appropriate for any children. You don't write on a child's face, destroy beloved comfort items, or ruin a birthday party to teach kids to behave. I shudder to think of what other ways he's a terrible father and he should not be surprised when his kids cut him out of their lives once they're old enough.", "Sounds like Bob's about to destroy Miles' favourite golf clubs...\n\nOP, NTA. But Miles sure is.\n\nI'm gonna hazard a guess that when you celebrate Lucas and Claire's BDays, it's not favouritism, but suddenly celebrating Andy's BDay on the 24th of Dec is favouritism?\n\nThough I could be extra sensitive about this topic, as I'm a Dec 23rd Baby.", "NTA.\n\nPlease consider that you are maried to a person that **enjoys being cruel to children.** It's not just being the asshole, it's disturbing.", "I usually don\u2019t tend to say this but this action on your husbands behalf is horrible, and worth of divorce papers being delivered. \n\nElf on the shelf is supposed to be a tradition to keep the kids spirits and hopes for Christmas. Not something the parents can use as an excuse to be bullies with their kids. It\u2019s ok to joke with it a little but he took it way too far. Kids remember this kind of stuff and now Andy would have a terrible core memory of his bd.\n\nAlso ask Miles why he was so obsessed on getting Andy. Like that\u2019s what freaked me out the most. Please OP get away of this dude \n\nNTA", "NTA but *what* is wrong with your husband??\n\n\n We do elf on the shelf each year but the elves do shit like hanging candy canes on the tree or \"making\" breakfast (big mess). They absolutely do not meddle with the kids while they sleep or cut up clothes! That's really creepy! And where did your husband get the notion that the elf should \"punish\" the child? That just sounds like an excuse to be sadistic.", "Sounds more like a Christmas horror story.\n\nNTA\n\nJust in case you need to burn Bob so he does not come back", "NTA your husband seemed to have more fun during the entire elf on the shelf time than your kids did. Your husband was TA instead of making it a magical and cute time for the kids he turned it into entertainment and laughter for himself, gross.", "NTA. \"Bob\" is supposed to be naughty, not destructive. Looks like your husband just found a loophole to be an asshole without consequences.", "NTA.  \n\nYou don't bully and terrorize children.  The fact that it makes him *so happy* doing this is very unsettling.  It may seem innocent to many people but he's destroying their property and writing on them with permanent marker.  If an adult did that to another adult it's considered assault by definition.  And why did he feel the need to terrorize Andy when he admitted himself that the child has been following every rule?  \n\nI'm so disgusted right now.", "You are NTA- but your husband is a huge TA.  Ask him why he thought it was appropriate to ruin his son's birthday like that?  I can tell you now that Andy will never forgive his father for this like ever. I hope Miles had fun destroying his relationship with his son.", "NTA\n\nMiles has heard of EOTS and has twisted it to make the elf evil. This is awful. If you read the book, all the elf does is move around your house when it returns from the North Pole. It\u2019s surveillance, not punishment. \n\nOur elves only do nice things. It is better to reward good behaviour than punish bad. They bring treats, decorate the dolls house so it\u2019s Christmassy, and do some silly things like pants on the tree or roll toilet roll down the stairs as a rollercoaster ride but the elves are not there to punish. Talk about the magic of Xmas. How are cruel punishments magical at all?", "NTA. You've married and had a child with a bully. I'm sorry for you and your kids. He is literally mean to your son and it breaks my heart.", "NTA. Does your husband single out Andy other times?", "NTA, that's a stupid tradition if I ever heard one. I dont see the appeal in being a jerk to your kids. Eventually they'll figure out it was him their parents all along.", "NTA how would he like to me mentally torturered or have items destroyed for seemingly no reason. \n\nHe needs therapy. Tell him to do it before he harms the kids even more.", "NTA.  A few things.\n\n1) EotS is already somewhat of a creepy tradition.  \"Behave, the elf is watching...\" just ugh.  That said, done with consideration it can be OK.  Usually you get \"elf reports\" when the kids are less than nice, that you then show your kids.  Maybe get them to apologize or whatnot.\n\nWhat your husband was doing, however, was abusive.  Cutting pieces out of a 5 year olds' onesy?  Not only not in keeping with the spirit of Elf or Christmas, that was straight up cruelty.\n\n2) What did Andy even do to merit having the elf eat his cake? It sounds like nothing beyond having a tradition that step-dad didn't like connected to his birthday.\n\nI would advise counseling for the kids.  I would also suggest you consider if you really want to be married to someone with this much of a cruel vindictive streak.", "Just so I\u2019m clear:\n\n1. You and Andy\u2019s father came up with something to take the sting out of your son having a birthday on Christmas Eve, something which must truly suck as a kid.\n\n2. Your husband decides that this is \u201cfavouritism\u201d.\n\n3. Your husband uses a toy elf to start bullying the kids (destroying Claire\u2019s favourite onesie - wtf?).\n\n4. Andy\u2019s behaving himself however and therefore \u201cBob\u201d is unable to do anything to him.\n\n5. This so annoys your husband that he decides to ruin your son\u2019s 8th birthday by destroying his cake in an act of pure unadulterated spite.\n\nOP, you\u2019re NTA but my God your husband surely is.", "NTA asshole but your husband definitely is! That's a great way to make sure your kids hate Christmas and possibly later him. I can't even begin to understand what went through his mind with those pranks! \n\nRather than punishing for bad behavior (with exeptions) you should focus on rewarding good behaviour. If you're doing the elf on the shelf again next year I suggest that the elf \"gives\" them candy or something small as a reward for good behaviour. If one of the kids doesn't do their chores then you can just not give them anything the next day rather than breaking their stuff and giving them bad experiences. \n\nI'm not blaming any of this on you btw. That advice is for your husband and I also suggest that he grows up.", "NTA", "NTA wow... like I went into this expecting to call you TA but that was a roller coaster. There is doing some magic stuff for your kids to let them know that it is okay to believe in that stuff... then there is ruining clothes, drawing on someones face, and then RUINING a birthday just because HE WANTED TO BE FUNNY! I put those parts in caps to emphasize that this was NO longer about wanting to even up the magic for all of your kids and it was about an adult man wanting to get his jollies off because he found it hilarious to prank the kids. Seriously, your husband needs to grow tf up! Stopping the pranks after he destroyed clothing, your daughters FAVORITE should have been non-negotiable. He was inventing things for \"Bob\" to mess with your kids.   \n\n\nNow, I'm sure he thought it was great fun for everyone, and maybe it was a family tradition. Honestly I've always wondered how people with birthdays around Christmas end up celebrating, and it seemed like what you were doing for your kid was pretty entertaining for him. Your husband needs to rein it in though. He is definitely on the naughty list.", "Elf of the shelf is supposed to be harmless pranks that everyone finds funny. He is a naughty elf not a nasty one. It\u2019s not an excuse to destroy peoples things. If the \u201cvictim\u201d of the prank isn\u2019t laughing then it\u2019s not a prank. It\u2019s bullying. Your husband took this way too far. NTA.", "NTA. Your husband sounds a bit of a prick. He insisted you end a tradition that celebrated your son (the only child who isn't his) and replace it with a new tradition that he then uses to ruin your son's birthday. You don't mention any reason for the elf to punish your son. That suggests it was nothing to do with creating magic at Christmas, and he was simply being spiteful.", "NTA.\nWow, your Husband is so the AH.\nInstead of one child feeling extra special during the Christmas season,  you could have just included all the children in the special events but instead you're husband wants to aggressively punish the children in kind of sadistic ways. \nYuck.", "NTA - please dye all your husbands work clothes pink as a prank. \n\nThen do it again a month later. \n\nThen again another month later.", "What exactly was magical about having Bob destroy your kids\u2019 possessions?\n\nNTA\n\nAlthough I\u2019d suggest bringing Bob back to replace all of your husband\u2019s underwear with underwear that\u2019s two sizes too small.", "NTA but I would have chucked the elf as soon as it cut up Claires onesie. That is not what elf on the shelf is about at all. \n\nYour husband is a massive asshole using the elf to bully and punish your kids.", "NTA. Why is your husband obsessed with pranking literal children in a way that genuinely upsets them to the point of tears? Healthy adults don't play pranks on children that frighten them or damage their belongings. Pranks that are appropriate to play on children are things like \"got your nose,\" or wrapping a small (but nice) present in a really big box with a medium box inside with a small box inside that, or making a \"litterbox cake\" out of Oreo crumbs and Tootsie Rolls... harmless stuff that everyone gets a laugh out of!\n\nIf he doesn't pretty quickly simmer down and realize he was out of order, I honestly think you should move out for your children's safety until/unless the two of you can get some clarity through therapy on what motivated him to behave this way and how he can avoid getting into that mean-spirited mode ever again. He owes sincere apologies to you and to all of the children.", "NTA \n\nA thousand red flags \ud83d\udea9 for your husbands behaviour \n\nHe actually wanted his stepson to be naughty because he was desperate to punish him \n\nEven worse - he did it on his birthday \n\nHe\u2019s TA \n\nYou seriously need to consider your relationship - couples therapy is crucial \n\nIt\u2019s very concerning that he still cannot see his behaviour was wildly inappropriate and tries to blame you", "NTA.

It sounds like the whole elf on the shelf thing was an excuse to do purposely shitty things to the kids. \n\nFrankly, your husband sounds kinda insane. \nWhat he did to Andy was the worst, but the other pranks are pretty cruel, too. Imagine a kid coming to school with marker all over their face and telling the teacher that the damn elf did it. I would expect a call from the school asking if everything was alright at home, because it\u2019s pretty obvious at this point that one if the parents is unhinged enough to do stupid shit like that.\n\nAnd cutting up a favorite onesie of a 5yo girl as some weird ass prank by an adult is straight up crazy. \n\nBut what\u2019s most disturbing is that he couldn\u2019t find a reason for the elf to punish Andy, so he just escalated that to ruining his birthday.

We have 3 kids, Lucas (9M), Andy (8M), and Claire (5F). Where Lucas and Andy are from our past relationships. However, Miles (my husband M37) has accepted Andy as his, and so did I (F35) Lucas. \n\nEvery Christmas is special for Andy, his bd is on Dec/24.  His dad started a tradition where Santa would've consideration with him for being a \"kid of Christmas\". So he feels magical and special. I always try to give him that. Last year, i left \"Santa Claus\" footsteps, ate a carrot and \"grass\" he left for Rudolf. Stuff like that. \n\nMy husband doesn't think it's a good idea i do all that for him, and I'm showing favoritism. So, we should shut it down, because of my ex's decision to create a tradition without considering my other kid's feelings. I disagree since i do consider the 3 of them. But he asked if we could so smth else, like the Elf on the shelf. I had no problem with it, but I didn't know how that works. He explained me quickly, and since he was the one who offered, i let him do it. \n\nWe bought the cute Elf. My kids named it \"Bob\". Later my husband explained them they should behave, and never touch/hold Bob if they don't want it to be naughty. At first, it was cute to see them spy on Bob, try to see it \"fly\" each night. Andy was the most excited of all, i found him one night talking with it, asking it if Santa still remembered him. \n\nBut my husband took seriously the \"Behave or Bob would be naughty\" part. Lucas was his first victim after he didn't do his chores. The next day, his face was drawn with sharpie markers. Then Claire, who touched Bob and her fave onesie was destroyed. Apparently, Bob had cut some pieces of it, while she was sleeping. Miles was having fun, but i could see my kids weren't. I talked to him about how we should lower the pranks, he agreed but wanted to catch Andy since he hadn't break any rules. I told him that Bob's supposed to tell Santa instead of being naughty. We argued but he finally agreed. \n\nFast forward, it's Christmas Eve and in the afternoon we had some of Andy's friends to celebrate his bd. So the kids were playing in backyard. But my husband looked sus. I decided to look for Bob. It was supposed to be in the kitchen but it wasn't there, I asked Miles where it was and he told me \"no idea\". I started getting paranoid, but Andy asked me if we could cut the cake already. I put my best face on and went for it. The cake was in a box, and when Andy opened the box. He starts crying. I take a look and it's ruined. \"Bob\" was covered in all of it, appearing he had been eating the cake. Half of the cake wasn't there anymore. Miles starts laughing and so did some of the other parents. \n\nMy blood is boiling and i grab Bob and throw it in the trash, Then i grabbed Miles. We have a terrible argument, calls me an AH for what i did to Bob, that I've ruined it, how are we supposed to keep the \"magic\" with our kids if i wasn't supposed to touch Bob.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It used to be the parents just did silly \"pranks\" like the elf causing harmless mischief like fishing for.goldfish, getting into candy, etc. People set them in different scenes or positions ever night that they're there.

I guess it's supposed to be a part of the story that was baked in to stop kids from moving it where their parents can't find it, and then wondering why it's not moving by itself anymore.\n\nBut I've also read TIFUs like \"I was babysitting a kid, and when I touched their Elf on the Shelf, they started crying because they thought I killed it by taking the magic away.\" Or whitepeopletwitter posts like, \"My daughter saw the Elf on the Shelf display in Walmart and started questioning what I told her about them coming from the North Pole, so I went and yelled at customer service.\"\n\nWhen my dad got one for my little (half) sisters, though, I don't remember any mention of the 'it's watching you' stuff.

They might have known my dad was moving it and still thought it was funny because he did funny things with it.\n\nI'm all for playing fun make-believe games (Santa, tooth fairy, etc) with kids, and even getting really deep into the imagination of it. I also think some people either go too far, thinking they *need* their children to believe in Santa/the elf or they've failed as parents (accidentally causing emotional distress along the way); or are just mean, authoritarian people that use the fear of Santa/the elf as another means for control (giving the concept a bad name).\n\nEDIT: I can't point to a pivotal time that I \"found out\" that Santa and the tooth fairy weren't real. I only remember knowing it was my parents, but having so much fun pretending they were real, that I went along with it anyway. I think that's the way these things should be approached.", "I mean, if you learn about it as a kid it's not a stretch.

I tell them to tell the elf what they want and the elf will tell Santa. I'm in an elf group on Facebook to get ideas, and I will say... it really is terrible how some parents use it as leverage over their kids or as a punishment.

Thanks.", "oops,I said similar until I saw you comment.", "The [definition of bullying](https://www.ncab.org.au/bullying-advice/bullying-for-parents/definition-of-bullying/) literally includes that one is in a position of power over another. Whether it be social, financial, a groups of friends for backup, etc. it is also sustained and targeted, which this absolutely was.\n\nAbuse is also not limited to a situation in which someone has a duty of care toward someone else (I think you\u2019re thinking like, criminal negligence), and I don\u2019t think you can argue that because \u201cin this context\u201d it happens to be by a step parent who does have a duty of care, it is somehow *not* also bullying. \n\nIn most cases, including this one (sustained pattern of targeted cruel behaviour toward someone in a more vulnerable position by someone in a more powerful position, intended to upset them) abuse and bullying are generally the same thing.\n\nI get that there are different connotations\u2026 but all this commenter said was \u201cI see no difference,\u201d by which they clearly meant that both are absolutely unacceptable by a parent (because bullying by a parental figure automatically qualifies as abuse), so why bother correcting? And despite you using \u201cconnotation,\u201d and \u201cgenerally,\u201d it comes off as \u201ccorrecting,\u201d because you\u2019re explaining why someone \u201ccorrected\u201d someone who called it bullying. Which was incorrect. \n\nI think they\u2019re right in that there is no need to say \u201cno it\u2019s abuse\u201d as if that somehow carries more weight or as if there is somehow a qualifiable difference. The definition of bullying is sustained, targeted abuse of someone vulnerable by someone in a position of power. In my opinion, bullying should NOT colloquially be taken more lightly, which I think what the person correcting that it\u2019s \u201cabuse\u201d was implying. Because, by definition, it is actually worse because it is a sustained pattern, whereas abuse is an action intended to harm. \n\nAll bullying is abuse, but not all abuse is bullying. So I feel like reducing it to a \u201cpeer to peer\u201d connotation and acting like abuse is on a whole other level or something else entirely is actually belittling and harmful to those who actually experience bullying.", "Not disagreeing with the definition you\u2019ve provided, but I do disagree with a couple of the examples you\u2019ve provided to illustrate it- my future husband has zero \u201cauthority\u201d over me, any more than I have \u201cauthority\u201d over him.\n\nI know that isn\u2019t the case for all relationships- I know that all too well- but I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to perpetuate the myth that people in relationships have power over their partners. \n\nAlso, there are plenty of abusive women in the world.

I really hope OP doesn\u2019t let this slide.", "If you want the actual difference (by definition):\n\n- Abuse is an act intended to cause harm (especially but not necessarily if it is repeated).

All bullying is abuse, but not all abuse is bullying. Some abuse, but not all abuse, specifically involves violating or taking advantage of a duty of care (but in those cases, abusing someone you have a duty of care toward still automatically makes it bullying).\n\nThere are perceived colloquial differences in connotation, but in my opinion those are actually harmful and (like we saw in this example where someone tried to \u201ccorrect\u201d someone that this is abuse, when all bullying is abuse, as if that carries more weight), actually trivializes victims of childhood or peer bullying. \n\nIf they meant \u201cchild abuse,\u201d which implies abuse of a child by an adult, and not necessarily one with a duty of care except that which is automatically conferred by an adult to a child but in this case was an actual duty of care from a parental figure, then they should say that. \n\n**I know it\u2019s nitpicking, but they nitpicked u/daedalus871 in the first place.**\n\nThe original comment:\n\n> That's not punishment, it's bullying.\n\nThe r/confidentlyincorrect reply \u201ccorrecting\u201d them with a condescending asterisk:\n\n> *Abuse.
