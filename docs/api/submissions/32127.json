If you met a random woman out clubbing it might've been a little bit different, but overall this seems weirdly controlling to me. It's not some random woman, it's your friend's partner. Does she also think it inappropriate for your friends to come visit *you* while she's around?", "NTA your GF is being untrusting and controlling.", "NTA. You were with all your friends and that woman was your friend\u2019s gf. It actually sounds like being at the gf\u2019s house was safer and cheaper than going out clubbing or drinking at a bar. Would she have a problem if you were drinking at a bar where other women were present?", "NTA - girlfriend seems controlling", "Wait, you were never alone with the woman in question, correct? AND AND AND the woman in question is the SO of one of your friends, correct?\n\nNTA\n\nBenefit of the doubt, but maybe your GF doesn't completely understand the scenario?", "NTA\n\nYou didn't go alone to some random woman's house. You went with your friend to their partner's house. That's what friends do.\n\nYour partner is being really weird here.", "NTA with an insecure girlfriend.", "Soft NAH, because it likely isn\u2019t intentional on your part. But your girlfriend is probably hurt about your plans suddenly changing so drastically from what they were originally (staying in a hostel for three nights, vs returning home at 2am one night and clubbing another, especially when she\u2019s not included). \n\nEveryone has different boundaries about this sort of thing and it sounds like it\u2019s time you two need to talk about what your comfort levels and boundaries are, and if you\u2019re willing to accommodate each other on this or not.", "NTA, I don't see why you would be the asshole. There's nothing wrong with enjoying the time with friends at one of their places, especially if they invited you.\n\nYour girlfriend seems kind of untrusting and maybe even controlling. I would try to seek an open conversation with her and ask her why she feels that way and maybe try to find a compromise for future situations like this so you don't have to miss out but she doesn't feel uncomfortable. \n\nAlthough in my opinion you shouldn't apologise or avoid going to get togethers like this in the future because in a good and healthy relationship you should be able to enjoy time with your friends - even your female friends.\n\nObviously there might be more to the story than what you have written, but from your post alon that's what I'm getting. If she isn't giving a reasonable explanation or able to make a compromise with you, you should maybe rethink your relationship because getting mad at your partner spending time with their friends and wanting them to stop is in no way healthy for a relationship.", "Not so fast. What were the genders of the housemate and other friends from the group?", "YTA\n\nEveryone is saying NTA but if it were my partner, a woman drinking at a man's house, I would be uncomfortable about that. That is risky behavior, and making sound choices that help to eliminate risky behavior is important. That your girlfriend expects you to make better decisions is not controlling or overbearing, but rather it is normal.", "Most certainly ta, plz stop drinking.", "I\u2019d only say YTA (but even saying asshole is strong), I\u2019d more so say you\u2019re insensitive - if you have a history of cheating when you drink?\n\nBut if you don\u2019t have a history of cheating then NTA! Your SO has distrust in you, either because of something you\u2019ve done in the past, or because of an insecurity.
