Grandpa died more than 20 years ago, and my grandma kept everything until she died, about 4 years ago. My father apparently decided to renounce the inheritance in favor of my aunt, who had been the one to take care of grandma when she was old. My sister and I had much less of a relationship with her, as we grew up on the opposite side of the country.\n\nHowever, my dad could not simply renounce his half, because it would just pass onto us. He told us he had a huge debt with the bank, and he would renounce because otherwise they would take his 50%, and urged us to also renounce in favor of our aunt, so at least she could enjoy the whole inheritance. We believed him, renounced, and moved on.\n\nAbout two years later our dad died, and because he had supposedly died in debt, we didn't claim his inheritance. Fast-forward another two years and here comes the plot twist: apparently, when we renounced, we only only actually did so for our grandma's side of the inheritance, meaning we're still entitled to 25%, from our grandpa.\n\nThis was discovered by my aunt when she went to sell one of the properties, but couldn't, as we are still entitled to 25% of it. She called us and asked us to renounce the other 25% so she could sell, but my sister decided to check on our father's debt situation, to see if we could get at least a portion of the sale. She requested reports on our father's debt situation, which showed no debt, not even in a report from 10 years ago.\n\nWe don't know if the debt was a fabrication, or maybe a much smaller or older debt that was forgiven. We had already thought it weird that when our dad died, no one had contacted us about the debt.\n\nWe've decided to accept the remaining 25%, which includes part of an apartment (my aunt's current home and workplace) and two smaller properties. All in all, it's not a huge amount of money (probably about 20-30k euro each), but still significant. Having that money could be the difference between my struggling sister and her husband (plus two kids) being able to afford the down-payment on a home, or renting forever.\n\nMy aunt has however accused us of being horrible people, and of disrespecting my father's wishes that she keep the whole inheritance. I see my father's decision, however well intentioned, as ultimately irresponsible towards his children.\n\nShe has told us that having to sell those properties (or buy our share) would destroy her life and ruin her chances of having a retirement (she's in her late 50s now) , as she's entitled to a small pension because of not having worked enough years throughout her life. However, she also owns 100% of another home that's outside the scope of the inheritance.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678230232, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11leknl/aita_for_not_renouncing_my_fathers_inheritance_in/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was your GRANDPARENTS original wished for it to be 50:50. How is it any more respectful for her to demand 100, she already has 75!\n\nYikes such people who throw around \"horrible people\" at those who don't just give them what they want.. they are ASSHOLES.", "NTA sounds like auntie had some dirt on your dad.", "NTA do not renounce it under any circumstance", "NTA - I appreciate what your Dad was trying to do with your aunt as a thank you for caring for their Mother, but it isn't fair to you really. If 40-60 Euro is 25% of the sale, that should leave her with a pretty good chunk of cash. Between that and the other property she has that's all her own, she should be fine.", "> disrespecting my father's wishes that she keep the whole inheritance\n\nAnd she's disrespecting her parents' wishes for it to be shared.\n\nUltimately, it seems that you have a negligible relationship with her, which makes it seem rather rich that she just expects you to yield rightful inheritance to her, when she 100% owns one property, and will still 75% own her current apartment AND two other properties.\n\nWill it really \"destroy her life\" to only (for sake of argument) own *three properties* outright (say for sake of argument the 25% share is equal to one of the smaller ones)?\n\nNTA. The story about your father's debt definitely seems fishy, and she is not going to be a poor woman by any reasonable standards if you DO accept your inheritance - and it will make a substantial difference for your sister's family. I'd like to think your grandparents would be a lot happier to see more of the family helped out by inheritance, rather than it all going to one person.", "He gave her his half, no that's it.  Enjoy your half.", "NTA your aunt was never entitled to everything and sounds manipulative", "NTA but your dad was sneaky. If he wanted his sister to have inheritance due to taking care of parents, then he should have said so. He lied. Aunt is sneaky knowing he lied and is trying accuse you both of deception. Dad was TA and aunt is now TA, for trying to strong arm you both out of a small portion.", "NTA but this sounds like you need a lawyer :/", "NTA. Your father did you a disservice. Fortunately you are still entitled to some inheritance as intended.", "NTA", "I've got to lean toward YTA because your father made his wishes clear and you weren't counting on that money. Then you add in that the money would come from your aunts home (which puts her out of the place so it can be sold) and you sound incredibly cold and as if you're only worried about making money!!\n\nIt's made worse by the apparent fact that since your aunt cared for your grandmother she isn't getting retirement, which wraps right around to your father's wishes making perfect sense!", "NTA", "As a threshold matter, where does your sister live that $30k euros is enough for a down payment on a house? I\u2019m moving there tomorrow.\n\nJokes aside, this is a pretty weird situation. First off, although IAAL, this appears to be a European situation. I don\u2019t know the intestate laws of your country/jurisdiction, but in the US (least in NY), I\u2019m fairly certain that your father renouncing while his sister is alive automatically would result in her receiving 100% of the grandparent\u2019s estate. It doesn\u2019t just flow to you. Also, I\u2019m not sure why your grandpa\u2019s and grandma\u2019s estates were separate. Unless there was a very interesting will situation, again under NY law, your grandpa\u2019s estate should have gone 100% to your grandma upon his death. So, there wouldn\u2019t be this problem of the split inheritances. But, assuming that\u2019s the law in your country\u2026.\n\nThe question then becomes whether you\u2019re wrong to go back on your word. You and your sister agreed to that arrangement. It was based on a false premise, but both your father and you and your sister agreed to it. I think your aunt has a legitimate reason to be upset that you\u2019re changing your minds now, regardless of your dad\u2019s debt situation. \n\nThat said, if you\u2019re legally entitled to it\u2026 you\u2019re legally entitled to it. It seems like your aunt is doing just fine money-wise.. so, I would think that she would be able to look past what you agreed to, if you informed her of the false premise, especially given how it would apparently materially improve your lives AND the fact it\u2019s only 25% of the sale. This allegation that it would ruin her life is just ridiculous.\n\nIm not sure what I\u2019d do in this situation. But, you\u2019re going back on your word and she\u2019s being overly dramatic and mean. So, I kinda have to give an ESH.", "YTa. Legally, you\u2019re probably going to prevail but this is not a \u2018is it legal\u2019 site. Your aunt took care of your aging grandmother for *years* and your father wanted her to receive the property as recompense for all his sister sacrificed to be a caregiver to his mother. Your aunt would have a heftier pension if she had been able to work all those years in a career.", "NTA, dad\u2019s heart wasn\u2019t in the right place here. You\u2019re right. It was parents wishes for it to be 50/50 and your dad went against their wishes. It\u2019s only right you go against his unfortunately. She owns a whole other property, she\u2019ll be fine.", "NTA get a lawyer asap and do not renounce it. Fight her if she fights it.", ">My father apparently decided to renounce the inheritance in favor of my aunt, who had been the one to take care of grandma when she was old.\n\nYTA\n\nYour aunt took care of your grandmother for years. Your father felt that the inheritance (which you admit is not much) was recompense for that.\n\nNow that your father is dead you are willing to renege on the agreement. Do you have a legal right to do so? Yes. A moral right? No.\n\nYou are greedy.
