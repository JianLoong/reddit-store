Grandpa died more than 20 years ago, and my grandma kept everything until she died, about 4 years ago. My father apparently decided to renounce the inheritance in favor of my aunt, who had been the one to take care of grandma when she was old. My sister and I had much less of a relationship with her, as we grew up on the opposite side of the country.\n\nHowever, my dad could not simply renounce his half, because it would just pass onto us. He told us he had a huge debt with the bank, and he would renounce because otherwise they would take his 50%, and urged us to also renounce in favor of our aunt, so at least she could enjoy the whole inheritance. We believed him, renounced, and moved on.\n\nAbout two years later our dad died, and because he had supposedly died in debt, we didn't claim his inheritance. Fast-forward another two years and here comes the plot twist: apparently, when we renounced, we only only actually did so for our grandma's side of the inheritance, meaning we're still entitled to 25%, from our grandpa.\n\nThis was discovered by my aunt when she went to sell one of the properties, but couldn't, as we are still entitled to 25% of it. She called us and asked us to renounce the other 25% so she could sell, but my sister decided to check on our father's debt situation, to see if we could get at least a portion of the sale. She requested reports on our father's debt situation, which showed no debt, not even in a report from 10 years ago.\n\nWe don't know if the debt was a fabrication, or maybe a much smaller or older debt that was forgiven. We had already thought it weird that when our dad died, no one had contacted us about the debt.\n\nWe've decided to accept the remaining 25%, which includes part of an apartment (my aunt's current home and workplace) and two smaller properties. All in all, it's not a huge amount of money (probably about 20-30k euro each), but still significant. Having that money could be the difference between my struggling sister and her husband (plus two kids) being able to afford the down-payment on a home, or renting forever.\n\nMy aunt has however accused us of being horrible people, and of disrespecting my father's wishes that she keep the whole inheritance. I see my father's decision, however well intentioned, as ultimately irresponsible towards his children.\n\nShe has told us that having to sell those properties (or buy our share) would destroy her life and ruin her chances of having a retirement (she's in her late 50s now) , as she's entitled to a small pension because of not having worked enough years throughout her life. However, she also owns 100% of another home that's outside the scope of the inheritance.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678230232, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11leknl/aita_for_not_renouncing_my_fathers_inheritance_in/", "score": 177, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The story about your father's debt definitely seems fishy, and she is not going to be a poor woman by any reasonable standards if you DO accept your inheritance - and it will make a substantial difference for your sister's family.

I\u2019m moving there tomorrow.\n\nJokes aside, this is a pretty weird situation. First off, although IAAL, this appears to be a European situation. I don\u2019t know the intestate laws of your country/jurisdiction, but in the US (least in NY), I\u2019m fairly certain that your father renouncing while his sister is alive automatically would result in her receiving 100% of the grandparent\u2019s estate. It doesn\u2019t just flow to you. Also, I\u2019m not sure why your grandpa\u2019s and grandma\u2019s estates were separate. Unless there was a very interesting will situation, again under NY law, your grandpa\u2019s estate should have gone 100% to your grandma upon his death.

It seems like your aunt is doing just fine money-wise.. so, I would think that she would be able to look past what you agreed to, if you informed her of the false premise, especially given how it would apparently materially improve your lives AND the fact it\u2019s only 25% of the sale. This allegation that it would ruin her life is just ridiculous.\n\nIm not sure what I\u2019d do in this situation.

TX not NY - but we do have similar if not the same laws. Definitely Esh. With your sisters circumstances your Aunt could have tried to work something out, but you are in fact going back on your word. Everyone in this scenario thought the inheritance had fully gone to your Aunt. Even you and your sister. But a technicality gave the opportunity to take it back. Again, different laws, but you did mention it was only a technicality in the law that prevented your father from just giving it to her. Your grandparents gave it to him, and for whatever reason or circumstances (which could have been extensive, if you didn\u2019t know about your fathers debt how could you know about your aunts or everything she had to do) your father felt your Aunt should get it. Now that there is a technicality and the reason you originally did it (father) is not as prevalent a factor, your changing your mind. Can you? Apparently. But morally, should you? No, everyone already thought it was hers. Maybe you could work out a compromise or maybe the circumstances of the original request for you to sign it over wasn\u2019t very firm or confident. So your questioning it now. Only you know that. But how would you feel if a missed signature suddenly took something away from you that all parties thought was yours (and the primary parties thought earned). And that missed signature was your family\u2026.. But from your description, nobody is clearly YTA and nobody is NTA either.\n\nAs a separate note, owning properties doesn\u2019t necessarily mean having equity, money, or wealth from them. The properties might have liens (mortgages). In the US a mortgage can be up to 100% of the value of the property and is extremely common for mortgages to be above 80% of the value. So \u201cowning a property\u201d doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s worth anything when it sells. It wasn\u2019t specifically mentioned so they could also be mortgage free McMansions for all I know. But so many posts on here keep saying \u201cshe has another property, she\u2019ll be fine\u2026\u201d  Many of these responses just sound greedy, almost like the advice is \u201ctake what you can, because you can.\u201d", "NTA", "She's money grabbed enough, he was your dad and you are entitled to what was his.\n\nNTA", "Christ.

Money to be paid to your three separate accounts.\n\nDoes aunt have children or a spouse who would inherit from her?", "NTA. I don't quite understand her financial argument, since she owns her home outright presumably she could still benefit hugely from the 75% sale of the other properties? She could use that money to buy a smaller property and rent it out for passive income. \n\nAlso, if she's renting these out currently you are entitled to 25% of the rent. I'm not saying you should go after her but you could be entitled to 25% of previous rental payments.\n\nI'd be so curious to know how this managed to happen, legally.", "It is probably Poland. In Poland one can inherit a debt, so while claiming inheritance you have to declare if you take all of it(including debt), claim the debt up to the worth of the estate (so after selling all of the estate the rest of the debt is voided) or renounce the inheritance, but that is tricky because when it goes to your minor children the court might not allow to renounce the inheritance on their behalf, crazy.", "As intended by who? The inheritor, who was the father? The father wanted the Aunt to have it. The law? So then your definition is legal = moral\u2026..", "as intended by the grandfather, who wanted half his estate to go to that part of the family", "She may be morally entitled to 100%. I will assume it is Poland and elderly care here is abysmal, so I have questions. How long did she take care of your grandmother, was she bedridden, if yes then how long? She could literally not work while taking care of her 24/7 changing diapers, feeding through a tube, and so on. People here do that, for years. Palliative care costs at least two times the minimum wage a month - that is if you can get a place at all. You should think hard about how much it would cost for the time she did that and compare it to the inheritance value.", "The Grandparents wanted both their CHILDREN to inherit it. If it had been important to them to give the grandchildren inheritance, then they could have. You have no idea what the Aunt did when taking care of the elderly parent for years, or how much debt she had to take on or money expended. The father who wanted that inheritance to go to her knew she was taking care of the elderly parent probably had some idea though. Legally OP is probably entitled to it, but legal doesn\u2019t always equate to morale. This comment is making so many self-entitled assumptions.", ">She worked for years to take care of your grandmother and that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t have a pension.\n\nCool, great, fantastic. That was something she signed up for, she knew she wouldn't get a pension and all the work she'd have to put in. She could have hired a carer instead. Now, in saying that she does deserve some money - but not all. \n\n>Her for being demanding of so much, and you for being entitled to money your father never intended to you. \n\nThese two statements are directly at odds. Aunt can't be \"demanding of so much\" if she's entitled to the money, if aunt isn't entitled to the money your statement about OP is incorrect. \n\n>Your dad wanted her to have that money. It was good of him. You should do what you think is morally right and not just economically convenient.\n\nDebatable. Yes, she took care of his mother and he has every right to relinquish his inheritance in favour of her. He also can ask his kids to relinquish their share, but they have no moral obligation to do so. **Especially** when you lie to your kids about your circumstances. Like are you missing the part where he told them he was in debt so they had to relinquish their rights, otherwise no one would get any money? I just can't understand how its moral to lie and induce your kids to \"promise\" money to someone. \n\nI think dad just felt bad aunt had to take care of grandma and screwed his own kids out of money to ease his guilt."]}
