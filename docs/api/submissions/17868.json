{"id": 17868, "submission_id": "13o9k56", "title": "AITA for matching my friend's boyfriend's obnoxious energy?", "selftext": "I (27f) went to a party at a friend's house yesterday. My friend was there with her boyfriend (30ish m). I don't like him, I think he's a douche to put it mildly. Me and a few people were talking about concerts we're planning to go to this year. I mentioned that I was going to see Bad Omens and Sleep Token later this year and how I was so excited because this was the first time I'd get to see both of them live.\n\nFor context, those are my 2 favorite bands and they've recently both gone viral on TikTok and exploded in popularity. I've been listening to both of them for around 2 years now, which was well before they went viral. Not that I think that's something that matters, and I'm thrilled they're both blowing up because they're incredible.\n\nWell my friend's boyfriend heard me say this and immediately came over and did this condescending little laugh and said the only reason I like them is because both the lead singers are hot and asked me to name 3 songs from each of them and before I could even respond told me that I could definitely only name the songs that had gone viral.\n\nI fucking HATE people like this. I don't know why it matters how you discover a band, and I think it's stupid to think that people have to be die hard fans to want to see them live. Anyways, I had a hunch that he did not, in fact, know 3 songs from both of them so I named off 3 each of their lesser known songs. He seemed surprised and kind of stammered that he'd have to check.\n\nI asked him to name 3 songs from each and they couldn't be the songs that I just named, nor the ones that had gone viral and to do it BEFORE he checked if I was right so he couldn't cheat. I mirrored his incredibly condescending tone that he'd had with me. He got all huffy and said that he didn't listen to them enough to know. So I said 'then shut the fuck up' and turned my back on him and continued my conversation. My friends were cracking up at this.\n\nMy friend reached out later and said that I was incredibly rude and that I shouldn't have embarrassed him like that, especially in front of a large group of people. I told her that's exactly what he was trying to do with me. She said I should apologize to him since I'd made people laugh at him and it had hurt his feelings. I told her I would not be doing that as he was the instigator.\n\nShe's now pissed at me and a couple of my other friends think I should just apologize to him to keep the peace. I'm now thinking maybe I should even though I don't think I did anything wrong. We aren't super close but I do think she's generally really nice and I do think this could make future gatherings really awkward.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the responses! I've decided I will not be apologizing to him. I'm also probably not going to be responding back to her if she keeps demanding I apologize. I know some of you wanted me to 'apologize' in a really petty, sarcastic way but I honestly don't want to talk to him further.\n\nAlso it warms my heart to hear how many comments said they either loved both bands or were going to check them out. ST just released a new album and it's glorious. My favorite songs from the album are Take Me Back to Eden and The Apparition if anyone wants to listen :)\n\nEdit 2: I saw a few comments regarding me stating that I knew of the bands prior to them going viral and how it also kind of felt like I was kind of gatekeeping. Please know that is not the case. I just added the extra context because I thought it made his question funnier. Like I said above, I'm thrilled that they've blown up recently. It doesn't matter to me if people are just this second finding out about them and loving what they're hearing, or if they've been listening for years. I'm just happy they're having so much success.

At all.", "\"I'll apologise if he can name 3 of my previous apologies, and it can't be any that went viral\"", "I really hate those videos of dudes going around asking people to name three songs from the band t shirt they\u2019re wearing. One girl just looked straight at him and said NO. That\u2019s the correct response imo.

Gatekeepers are jerks.", "NTA\n\nGatekeeping assholes are the most annoying kind of people out there. This is especially true for rock/metal music, I feel. The amounts of grown ass men/women telling me or my partner we're not 'true' to real metal music because we enjoy Metalcore or completely different genres altogether at times is baffling.\n\nI don't enjoy the music I enjoy to look cool or to impress people. I'm way beyond that age.", "Definitely NTA!\n\nAlso, thanks for the band rec, loved sleep token for a while so I'm going to have to look up bad omens.\n\nNo idea what songs have gone big but my fave is the offering so hopefully that's not too mainstream now lmao", "NTA!  He was trying, for whatever reason, to be \"the big man on campus,\" and act like women could never like these kinds of groups, either that or that he hates them and couldn't believe how you could possibly like groups like them.

I broke contact with him because I am not to be treated with disrespect. It doesn't matter how you came to like/love a band. I could understand it if you acted like you were the biggest fan and belittled everyone else who also were a fan but I doubt that was the case. So yeah, fuck your friend and her boyfriend. If she only sticks up for him she wasn't worth it anyway.", "NTA, apparently he can dish it but can't take it. He owes YOU an apology. Also I gave these two bands a quick listen and they're totally up my alley, thanks for mentioning them!", "interesting expression. i feel like i'm missing context, what does it mean?", "Boyfriend is like the guys who harass girls/women who are wearing band t-shirts.

Moon Knight?", "If you grew up in the 80s/90s, you'd be able to recognize the songs from the first notes bc that's how you:\n1. Won concert tickets on the radio\n2.

It may have driven me crazy.)", "Legit, I've got kids older than I was when Sailor Moon was new and out, I owned all 3 movies uncut on VHS subbed, I adored TF out of that show, have merch of it etc... and if I watch it after it's been a few years sure I'll remember chunks but whole areas? BAM it's like new. Brain decides what it holds on to vs not, and I am just along for the ride.  \nIt also makes me happy I've not come across many gatekeepy peeps in my circles of the JRPG community and it seems extremely rare in the otome community(at least on that \"do you know X Y and Z?\" front, now whether it still counts with chooseable gendered main characters and other gendered romance options or not.. whoo boy x-x that part gets 'fun').", "Same, but I don't have adhd. The only show i can think of where I remember every detail is *The Good Place* because something about the whole series really resonates with me for some reason. I think that's the only show I've ever been emotionally invested in, but I don't feel the need to gatekeep. I'm just happy when someone else is a fan and we can talk about it. \n\nBesides that, the only character names I remember are from *Modern Family* and *Friends* because those shows were/are so ubiquitous. \n\nCharacter names and other plot points beyond the general arc leave my memory pretty quickly. Even my favorite movies, like Mystic River and Atonement, just off the top of my head, I've watched a hundred times but don't remember a single character name.", "For the past 20+ years, hearing the words \"Blue 5\" pisses off everybody in the family thanks to my brother.", "Tbh it would have been MUCH better if it had been a Cthulhu induced nightmare, which Winds sample chapters seem to hint to be the direction of the series (that the show didn\u2019t even touch on at all!!)", "I\u2019ve seen the whole thing a few times, I\u2019ve just also seen that one bit a heck of a lot.", "Haha, thats a nice memory!

That's either ignorance or some serious mental gymnastics.", "Sounds like she wants you to coddle him because she does, and knows this is the way to appease his pathetic ego. Don't.

Don't apologize. You're my hero.", "NTA - He shouldn\u2019t give it if he can\u2019t take it. I listened to Sleep Token\u2019s new album yesterday. Chokehold is an absolute tune.

I hope you have fun seeing sleep token. I need to see whenever they\u2019re around in Houston.

I would GO THERE.... when they are both together and I would speak to him.... and ask him (if he interrupts) to please allow you to finish as interrupting is rude.\n\nI would lay out exactly how he made YOU FEEL with his condescending attitude and how he insulted you about a subject well you are well versed and he is not....
