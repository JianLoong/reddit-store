I've been listening to both of them for around 2 years now, which was well before they went viral. Not that I think that's something that matters, and I'm thrilled they're both blowing up because they're incredible. \n\nWell my friend's boyfriend heard me say this and immediately came over and did this condescending little laugh and said the only reason I like them is because both the lead singers are hot and asked me to name 3 songs from each of them and before I could even respond told me that I could definitely only name the songs that had gone viral. \n\nI fucking HATE people like this. I don't know why it matters how you discover a band, and I think it's stupid to think that people have to be die hard fans to want to see them live. Anyways, I had a hunch that he did not, in fact, know 3 songs from both of them so I named off 3 each of their lesser known songs. He seemed surprised and kind of stammered that he'd have to check. \n\nI asked him to name 3 songs from each and they couldn't be the songs that I just named, nor the ones that had gone viral and to do it BEFORE he checked if I was right so he couldn't cheat. I mirrored his incredibly condescending tone that he'd had with me. He got all huffy and said that he didn't listen to them enough to know. So I said 'then shut the fuck up' and turned my back on him and continued my conversation. My friends were cracking up at this. \n\nMy friend reached out later and said that I was incredibly rude and that I shouldn't have embarrassed him like that, especially in front of a large group of people. I told her that's exactly what he was trying to do with me. She said I should apologize to him since I'd made people laugh at him and it had hurt his feelings. I told her I would not be doing that as he was the instigator. \n\nShe's now pissed at me and a couple of my other friends think I should just apologize to him to keep the peace.

He started this fight, trying to accuse you of being something you are not. A naive fangirl. Does he do this to girls who play video games and then cry to his girlfriend that they kicked his ass online? Just curious. Also, he should also apologize. I would not apologize if he doesn't. Also, your friend may have many good qualities and my be genuine to most of the people that she interacts with, however, she is choosing her man over her girls. Her girls have been around longer. She needs to know that there are better men out there, that will respect her and her friends.\n\nAlso, if any of his actions were a joke, a bad one, but for fun, he should have said so instead of bowing up in pride and dying on his hill.\n\n1,000 percent Not The Asshole!", "Why is it always on the person who responds in kind to wanker energy that is asked to apologise?

He's butthurt that he didn't embarrass you and pissed it backfired on himself. That douch canoe capsized, and he's only got himself to blame for rocking it.

Thanks for sharing the names :)", "NTA and tell your friend that you will not internalize her misogynistic thinking that when an AH who happens to be male, starts shit then needs to be apologized to because a female put him in his place.

Some of my best friends are in bands that sell out stadiums. We have been friends for decades, I could not name one song they are famous for but I am often invited to join them on their world tours.

If she wants Peace he can apologize", "NTA if I were you I\u2019d totally take a page out of the boomer playbook and do a non apology like: \"I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t know jack shit about music\u201d.", "So he's Obnoxio and you decide to be Obnoxia. \n\n\nNever a good idea. Obnoxious people have a lot of shit going on inside, some or most of which they don't even realize sometimes.

Hear me out though! You were right in calling him out on his shit, he sucks. But telling someone to shut the fuck up is categorically rude. But I\u2019m saying YTA cuz you, my girl, can be way more creative than such a basic insult. \nMen like that are dumb and don\u2019t realize they suck, so all he knows is that you were mean (in his brain, he did nothing wrong). Had you said, \u201cMan! You came at me real judgy and ended up being wrong AF. Better luck next time condescending your way across a room, dude! I\u2019m gonna go over there now. Good luck with all that.\u201d \nCall people on their shit, but in a way it can\u2019t come back to you and teaches the perpetrator a lesson. \nDo you need to apologize? No. But you can choose your words to be explicatory, sarcastic, truthful, and (most importantly) specifically devastating. \nGo forth with your wits and mow the idiots down. \ud83e\udee1\ud83d\udcaa", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I love this energy", "YTA.. using language like that isn\u2019t dry ladylike. do better.", "NTA. He tried to embarrass you and you put him in his place. He is an instigator.  \n\nI seriously hate people who want other people to apologize to keep the peace. No. If you apologize, he will think he was right. He probably still does, but I am sure he will think twice about coming for you.", "NTA. You did exactly what he did. I don\u2019t see the problem", "Nah, NTA don\u2019t apologize. \n\nYou hurt his feelings? So what about yours?

No.", "NTA\n\nsleep token is bomb af and I did discover them on tiktok. However, there's been a few niche artists that I discovered before they blew up. Which it's really cool getting to watch them grow from being a minor artists to being majorly recognized but it shouldn't be a flex or a competition. Fans should be happy that their artists work is finally being recognized by a larger audience because that results in more money and increases their ability to do live performances and spend more time working on their craft. \n\nYour friend's bf sounds like a prick", "NTA. If keeping the peace means letting someone disrespect you, stay at war. He started the pissing contest and lost. Tell the girl (she's not your friend) that you'll apologize when he does, that should get her to leave you alone.", "NTA! Don\u2019t do it", "One of the things that are the same are \u201ckeeping the peace\u201d and \u201crethinking\u201d. You simply weren\u2019t in the wrong and matched his energy. He was like attacking you", "NTA. I hate assholes like this man, and as someone very heavily entrenched in the metalcore (and adjacent) scene, it\u2019s only right to spit in their faces. You did right and both of these people are losers for expecting you to apologise. \n\nAlso side note but how tf can he say it\u2019s about hotness? Noah sure but Vess? Most people have no clue what he looks like or who he is. I do, and can say that while he\u2019s attractive, he\u2019s not Noah Sebastian levels of hot.", "Gotta love hypocrites. Also goes to show where your \"sweet friends\" heart stands, she openly said and knew it was a large crowd he got embarrassed infront of. She's fine with you being embarrassed, not him.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI got a notification from a news outlet that someone shit themselves at a Sleep Token concert. So I guess they're pretty wild\ud83d\ude2d would love to see them", "Definitely nta and shouldn't apologize to him because he essentially hurt his own ego and needed to be humbled for sure. It doesn't sound like she's a good friend anyways if she's defending a guy's stupidity over her friend.", "NTA. Don\u2019t keep the peace.

Seeing them stammer is hella win energy", "Did this with a couple Star Wars jerks who heard me talking about the movies with a friend at a bar. They came over (uninvited) and tried quizzing me on weird trivia because, after all, girls can't be real Star Wars fans. Now, I like Star Wars, always have, but I wouldn't say I'm an expert on it and their questions were stupidly easy. Then I turned it around on them and started asking them about some random extended universe stuff I know and seeing them huff and puff not knowing the answers is still one of my favorite core memories. Damn was that funny.", "Gate keepers aka Flying Monkeys...", "NTA- he\u2019s the one that owes you an apology", "God I love stories like this. NTA. Well done", "Yes I agree, she should ask for an apology first as he started the whole argument and then got offended when she shut him down.

The verbal-pacifism route also can very much take its toll on you.", "I\u2019ve been a fan of Bad Omens since 2017-2018. I would have wiped the floor with him and named every song on each album.

Men need to take accountability for each other\u2019s stupid behavior like this.", "Sorry, but there are too many \u201cmen\u201d of all ages who behave this way. Would be nice if more men started calling each other out on their BS rather than allowing the continued pointless misogyny.\n\nOP - awesome job.
