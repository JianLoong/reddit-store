Would they expect a day care to refund their money? Did anyone tell you why you are suppose to give back money you were paid to babysit? What is wrong  with these adult family members.  Do they go to their jobs, get a pay check for their time and work, cash the paycheck,  then give the money back to their employer?  Of course not. So why are you expected to return the money.  Your relatives are liars and cons.  What a horrible way to treat a young relative.", "NTA. I guess you could spend $750 for 3 days of snacks and drinks at theme parks. $200 isn't bad for three days of babysitting.

I\u2019d say uncle and aunt were greedy, expecting *you* to look after their responsibility. If your dad was so upset about the cash, he should have intervened as soon as the money came out.

Your mom is right - no regrets, and I'm glad you had a good time.", "NTA. Question. Did you build your Light Saber or buy a premade one?", "NTA Let's do some math. Let's say you watched the kids for 8h/ day and were paid $300 per day. That is $37.5 per hour. There is more than one kid, and you spent some of that money to tend to their needs and entertainment. Let's say you made $30/ hr for yourself. Sounds reasonable if you still managed to enjoy yourself selling your vacation time for that sum.

That\u2019s so funny. \u201cShe gone\u201d. $300 a day sounds insane to me but I saw the comment where someone posted in room rates for babysitting and now $300 sounds fair! \n\nPahlease not a grown ass man trying to take money back after the service has been provided.
