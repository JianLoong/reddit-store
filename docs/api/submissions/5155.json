It is not a safe position to be in to be that dependent on his family's good graces. The deal may not last and how much legal recourse could you do if they stopped paying their end of the deal. Then you stuck in a different country and have no support.", "NTA\n\nAnyone saying op is in the wrong has no idea of the potential nightmare OP could be forced to live by giving birth in her ex\u2019s country.  If things went south she\u2019d never be able to leave with the child.  Ex\u2019s family could pretty much legally kidnap the child, leave her pennyless and with absolutely no recourse.  Come on Reddit, I thought you guys knew better than this.", "NTA.  You could get stuck in the ex\u2019s country if the baby is born there.  Very likely you can leave but the baby cannot.", "NTA. Being a mother is great. However, in the same breath, pregnancy, childbirth, and looking after a newborn are probably some of the hardest things you're going to go through in your life. In most cases, emotional support trumps financial support. \n\nAnd I think if you'd stayed, that financial support would have come with strings and left you in a potentially vulnerable position. What if, for example, you didn't want any visitors (apart from your ex) at hospital or for the first couple of weeks while you and the baby settled. Would his parents have accepted that, given they were financing you? I think (probably understandably) they'd think their financial support was buying them access to the baby and opinions on how the baby is raised.\n\nIf your ex (and his family) want to make the argument that you should live in a foreign country so he can be near your baby, you can make that exact same argument back. Why doesn't he move to your country if he feels that strongly.\n\nIdeally you would have discussed your move with him, even if it would have been a difficult discussion. However, the fact you didn't dare raise it with him, speaks volumes.", "NTA. Rarely do people offer financial support without stipulations. There may not be strings now, but once that baby came I wouldn't be shocked if his parents started making demands and thinking they had input on how it was raised. They could also cut off support at any given moment and then what?  \n\n\nIf you felt that you needed to go behind his back to make the move due to angering him, that is enough reason not to mention it. Manipluating you to stay is abuse. He may have quite prevented you from making the move through force.  \n\n\nYour baby can still have a relationship with both parents. Nothing is stopping him from moving to where you are now. Nothing is stopping him from visiting. New babies and single parenthood is a hard combo.

I am going to assume that this is both of your first child. I understand it's a scary experience to go through, especially when your family isn't in the same state/country. Although you had the support of your ex and his family, you needed your family by your side to help you through this. \n\nThe deal your ex and his family gave you was a good deal, but down the road, they may be able to control how you raise the child since they are bearing all financial responsibilities... \n\nIt would have been better to discuss with your ex how you were feeling and your wanting the comfort of your family while pregnant and after you have given birth.

And if you can\u2019t trust him, it\u2019s 100% the right move to get back to your own country where you\u2019ll have more support and stronger legal standing.

I think you did the right thing. Stay with your family. Raise your child where you are safe and comfortable.", "This right here is the reason you are NTA.  There is no way you should be trapped in a foreign country away from your family.  Your ex sounds like he has a bad temper which is concerning.  If he was kind, my guess is you wouldn't have fled the country.  Stay where you are.  I think you made the right choice.", "You did the right thing getting out now", "Just stay safe. It sounds like you trusted your gut, and you should keep doing that.", "You did everything right, from moving back to your home and support system before you had your baby to not telling him until you were safe.\n\nNTA at all.", "It's his baby, too, though.  Unless this is a case of abuse, just being an ex doesn't mean he's not the baby's other parent.\n\nIs there?  Or are you leaving a country with poor conditions for women to a country where you'll have more rights and be treated better?  I wouldn't fault you at all if that's the case.", "You did the right thing!!", "100% NTA if he is going to force you to stay then he's holding you and your baby hostage. That's not ok. Do what you need to do to keep both of you safe.", "This is key information that belongs in the OP.", "You did the right thing.", "That's so fucked up. You might wanna put that in the post cause I thought for a minute you'd just taken his child without even telling him end of story", "Exactly. They were trying to keep you in a country where you have less power and rights.", "For you and another commenter saying she\u2019s an AH for not telling him till she was gone, it\u2019s probably because she didn\u2019t feel safe and knew he and his family would try to coerce/force her into staying and giving birth there. In the post it literally says she knew he would be angry and try \u201canything\u201d to make her stay. She deserves to feel safe and supported during such a vulnerable time.", "Reading comprehension. The country is not \u201cnew\u201d it\u2019s her original home country. That\u2019s what this person is saying - she moved back to her home country, not somewhere new and random.", "They said they moved home to get family support.", "Yes, OP moved country.\nBack to her HOME country", "Exactly. It's the absence of any mention of assistance or presence outside of 'financial support'. \n\nI would have thought OP might mention that he wants to help raise the kid or co-parent if that were the case. It's pretty integral. \n\nWanting to be near the child is not the same as having a relationship with them or being a parent.", "What she did is not kidnapping. They aren\u2019t married, the baby isn\u2019t even born yet and there is no legal custody order in place.", "You aren't seriously arguing that a pregnant woman moving home to be with her family is the same as a non-custodial parent refusing to send children back to their home country after a \"holiday visit\"... are you?", "That would be no, not in the slightest. She\u2019s allowed to move wherever she wants. She\u2019s still her own person, even if pregnant.", "If mom is uncomfortable then id think child will be uncomfortable. The dad can still be a part of the kid\u2019s life. He can move closer.", "Not even what I\u2019m saying love.", "Oh I didn\u2019t meant to put states I volunteer and have a lot of helpful information for people who live in the us that can help them leave an abusive relationship.", "Ahh thank you, sorry I misunderstood. I deleted my post since it\u2019s no longer revelant", "No hope for a baby coming into a broken home. Unless it has some stellar grandparents who aren\u2019t bigots, then continue.", "You have every right to do what you think is best for you and your baby.\n\nAs an expat who had both my children away from my home country and family, it\u2019s a resounding NTA.\nIt\u2019s hard to do even with a devoted partner, if you feel like you needed to go home to be with your family it was the right choice.\n\nYou aren\u2019t committed to this man, and you can work out how he fits into your child\u2019s life later, right now it\u2019s about you and your baby.\n\nGood luck.", "Those things can be true and they could still be abusive. OP made the choice to avoid how the family would react. That makes me think there\u2019s something that\u2019s happened to make OP feel unsafe. The whole situation seems very odd and icky.", "If a mother has to flee in secret because she is afraid of what the father will do to make her stay, it's pretty naive to sum that up as \"be there for his kid and supportive in-laws.\"", "Totally agree.", "That's up to the courts.  It's unclear from the OP where this is all happening.  In most places, if she doesn't have a court order granting her sole custody of the child, it actually is illegal to take the baby out of the country without the father's permission.\n\nEdit: I stupidly raced right past a key word in the title - \"pregnant.\"   I was thinking we were talking about a newborn.   Custody obviously not an issue until birth. The father has an uphill battle if he wants joint custody.", "Depending on where, there are legal issues with taking the child out of the country without the other parents consent.", "But she's ethically required to make the father aware she's taking his child out of the country, before doing so.", "Good thing he's an ex then. He dodged a bullet.", "He really dodged a bullet. Good thing he isn't with her anymore if it's so easy to remove the father out of the equation without so much as a word about it til he has no option.", "Visas, jobs, life. Not everyone can just walk into a random country and be allowed to stay lol", "Nothing.  However, assholes leave the country with a child, without telling the parent. It's possible the father is an asshole, there's not enough information. But OP is unequivocally an asshole.", "Her wants don't matter when it comes to raising a child. It's about the child. She's being selfish and removed the child's father from the equation. \n\nNo one cares about her or his feelings. It's about the child's once conceived. As I said, unless he's violent or mentally abusive which we were told nothing about, she's the ass. Regardless of \"feelings\"", "She never said she was afraid of him? She said she waited to tell him because she was afraid he\u2019d be angry which\u2026 yeah. \n\nAlso, even in her account he is supporting her. So she moving home for \u201csupport\u201d seems kinda suspect.", "She never stated anything about abuse, just that he would be upset because SHE STOLE HIS CHILD AND MOVED TO ANOTHER COUNTRY.", "I feel like if it was a matter of safety, where she was being abused, she would\u2019ve said more than what she said in the post. She made an agreement with him and the family then disappeared, it\u2019s a shitty move. If she felt like what she did was good and she did it because of safety reasons like some type of abuse, she wouldn\u2019t feel guilty.", "You need to talk to a lawyer in your country to get accurate information for your situation.", "Depends. It's illegal without court order or proof where I live to leave the country of second parent unless violent.", "It\u2019s\u2026 still his kid? Unless you plan on an abortion he has a vested interest in his child.", "This is how I feel. \n\nThe family made their support conditional. Said conditions give them all the control. Without their financial support, she couldn\u2019t provide for the baby. Ex and his family could very easily prove the baby is best in their care. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like OP is keeping him away from the baby. Firstly, she\u2019s still pregnant. Second, why is it more important to all these YTAs the dad and his family come first. Nothing is stoping him from moving to where OP is. Why is his families support more important than OP\u2019s?", "That\u2019s what i was thinking. Like people are probably talking about a born child who\u2019s father is on the birth certificate and she\u2019d need his permission to leave the country with said child.", "I don\u2019t think there is one. You\u2019re pregnant, not a baby-making machine. You have authority over your own person to go where you want.", "They're wrong. It's possible this is the law in some particularly backwards theocracies where women have no legal rights, but it's not the law in any jurisdiction I'm aware of as it would be a flagrant breach of the woman's human right to freedom of movement.", "Your baby is not a person untill it's born after that the law applies but untill then it's just a potential person and a literal extension of your body.", "You are allowed to move wherever you\u2019d like while pregnant. In fact, it might be to your benefit to live in the country where you have citizenship.  I\u2019d hate to see your boyfriend sue you for custody and then get you deported. \n\nStay where you are!!\n\nNTA", "Okay, so let\u2019s say the plane ride is 10+ hours and he doesn\u2019t have the financial means or legal right to stay in the country\u2026 yeah that hinders their relationship. She took the baby without speaking with the father. That is wrong.", "Yea, and have to drop a couple grand to travel anytime he wants to see his child", "That is what the comment is implying by stating that she would never be able to leave, penniless and ex can kidnap the baby. Western countries have laws and controls for these things.", "Let's call it Fetusnapping then. Once the baby's born they should strive to be equal partners in raising the child and moves like this won't help that relationship foster. She's gaming the system and due to her being the one being pregnant that's her right. But to me at least it's on the line of being TA.", "Why can't the dad be the one to come visit? Why is it on her to trap herself and her baby and not on him to make it work?", "Exactly. All of this. She seems scared and that's why she needed to get away from him.", "Oh my apologies", "After the child is born, probably. But not until then. The child is legally part of her until she gives birth.", "Not a baby.  A fetus.  Different laws apply.", "There is no baby.", "The child yes. But the fetus? Nope.", "Pretty sure thst only kids in once the child actually exists.", "Nope, she isn't. She said it wasn't an option as he would try to stop her. \n\nThe child is part of her until it is born. It isn't legally a person, it doesn't have a passport. She has EVERY right to move HERSELF as she is still a human being with fundamental human rights. *She isn't property just because she's pregnant*.", "Not a child, she is pregnant", "Nope. There is no child. There is a fetus.", "Lol, nope. Nice try though.", "She hasn't left the country with a child.  She is pregnant.  If she doesn't move now she is at his mercy for the next 18 years.", "She didn't leave the country with a child.  She left while pregnant.  So I guess she's not an AH then.  OP says EX would be angry and \"do everything possible\" to stop her from leaving.  I don't know what that means, but OP seems to be fearful of what EX would do if she told.  I think that has to be taken into consideration.", "So, it's not about the parents' unless that parent is the father? \n\nA child needs a safe and secure environment. This is more important than how many parents or who they are. If OP feels more safe and secure in her home country around her family that is the best place to be. You cannot separate OP's needs from the unborn baby's.", "She didn't steal anything. She's pregnant and she moved home.", "Mom\u2019s comfort takes precedence over dad for the first few years. She\u2019s the one who\u2019s going to have her body torn apart, and the newborn is going to be attached to her, not him. Once baby is a toddler, then she should definitely take steps to ensure kid sees Dad equally.", "She didn\u2019t \u201csteal\u201d anything. The baby is literally a part of her, completely inseparable until it\u2019s capable of living on its own.\n\nShe simply moved herself, a singular legal entity, to another country. As is her right. \n\nA woman does not become a MAN\u2019s property the moment she\u2019s pregnant with a child. She has the same freedom of movement he does, and nothing is stopping him from moving to HER country to be with her and her family.", "She doesn\u2019t need to disclose to a bunch of strangers if she\u2019s being abused ? I\u2019m sure it would help with the context but I don\u2019t knock her for not outright posting about it. And your last point isn\u2019t necessarily true either. Abuse victims feel guilty about turning in their abusers all the time. They feel like they\u2019re to blame for their abuse. So I wouldn\u2019t give that point much merit. I\u2019m not saying I agree with what she did , I was just pointing out that the situation she was in sounded a bit sketchy. Being alone in another country relying on someone else for financial support and housing sounds scary. He\u2019s her ex for a reason.", "In every country I know of this is not true before the baby is born.", "This is correct. Most countries actually follow this", "I read it as if she gives birth in the US her partners family could kidnap the child and, if she wanted to go home, she wouldnt be able to. \n\nI know western countries have laws against taking children abroad,  it wouldn\u2019t the same be true for other countries? Like if she gives birth in her homeland then her partner would t be able to take the baby abroad/across state lines without her permission.", "I guess what I\u2019m asking is, do less developed countries not have similar laws in place? I assumed that they did.", "That is very naive thinking.\n\nA great amount of countries don't allow one parent to leave the country with the child without the permission of another parent. I live in a western developed EU country and know few women in the situation where they essentially are trapped here, because even after divorce they cannot return to their home countries with their kids because their ex that is from this country won't give them the permission to. So while theoretically these women can leave, they are essentially trapped because they could only leave if they left their children behind. It's not even about women's rights, but that goes for both parents and is supposed to protect one parent from taking the child away, as according to law here the child has right to both parents unless the court has decided one parent is dangerous and should have no custody or visitation rights. \n\nEdit: one woman I know even went to court because the ex was abusive prior to their divorce and even threatened her with a gun, but because there was not enough proof, he is still allowed to visit once a week and she's unable to leave despite full custody.", "Yup.  Didn't catch that rather important detail on the first read.", "In what world does communicating with someone make you their property?", "Child vs fetus doesn't really change the point I'm making.", "Communicating with a parent doesn't make you at their mercy.", "So does some of her family's feelings that she should return.", "Okay so what happens to the father? He just isn\u2019t part of the baby\u2019s life? Wow. If this was a man who took his child people would be freaking out.", "I'm going to explain this as simply as I can.\n\nPregnancy is a status that does not change a person's fundamental rights. If she has the right to travel freely between countries without notifying or seeking permission from other people - and she does have that right - it does not change because she is pregnant. \n\nAfter the child is born, if they cannot sort it out amicably, her ex can seek custody through legal channels. Until the child is born he does not technically have any legal rights to it, or to dictate the mother's actions.", "No but being held in a country not being able to leave without the other parents permission does.  \n\nHe and his family have already tried to use financial incentive to keep her there do you think he'd agree after the child is born?", "My brother was friends for years with my ex who was convicted with domestic violence against me and my kids. \n\nBelieve me, family's opinions don't always reflect reality.", "I'm not saying it changes her rights.  You can be an asshole and still be well within your rights.  She's not an asshole for leaving the country either.  How she went about it is what makes her an asshole.", "So now offering support is a bad thing? This guy can't win.", "Oh I get that it's possible her family's shitty, but it would seem strange to go to them for support if they were.", "I mean they aren\u2019t giving her HER financial support just the baby.\n\nThat\u2019s why she\u2019s originally leaving as well. Her financial situation got worst, but no mention of support or help there.\n\nShe also stated in another comment that the father would have more legal rights over the child if she stayed, so that\u2019s another reason she moved. Her home country gives her more rights\n\nHonestly just sounds like a bad situation for Op in general. Kinda feels like they only plan on keeping her around until the baby is born and then snatching the baby and ditching her", "I took the worse financial position comment to mean that now that she left the country, has the full financial burden. Definitely bad situations all around though."]}
