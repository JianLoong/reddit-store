I\u2019ve been looking for jobs for a while for before starting uni (in fall) and I got called in for an irl interview next week. \n\nThe office is an hour away and my mom said she doesn\u2019t feel comfortable with me going there on my own. So she wants to come with me. After some arguing I decided to do a compromise and I told her to just hang around the area and browse some stores or something instead and that if she HAS to come in to the building with me then that makes me uncomfortable and I\u2019ll cancel the interview. She did indirectly agree but I still feel bad about the whole thing and just uncomfortable but yeahh. \n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: I wrote this in a rush and also I read all your comments and so I will say some stuff here. \n\nI forgot to mention that I did tell her what shes gonna do if I get the job she cant come with me and she said that that\u2019s different. \n\nShe is normally like this with other things too and so in this case shes worried that the company is a scam or that I\u2019ll get kidnapped or something. But I would honestly rather be an idiot and end up getting scammed alone than take my mom with me, but at the same time I do understand her and I know that she is just worried. So thats why I feel bad and am trying to compromise. \n\nShe has a hard time letting me be more independent. And it works in her favor too cause I\u2019ve had a hard time being independent but with this I just want to try on my own for once. And like one person mentioned I wanna be in \u201cinterview\u201d mode and so it is harder like this. \n\nAlso thank you all so much for answering!!
