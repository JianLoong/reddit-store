If the person doing the interview sees a parent there is no way you will get the job.  Remember the interview begins the moment you enter the building.  You do not want her anywhere near the building. Even hanging around outside. Some employers will ask receptionists about the candidates actions in the lobby.  You don't want ANYONE seeing your mother.", "NTA. Most jobs are looking for people that have some level of self-direction and independence, so a candidate showing up with their mom to the interview would be seen as a red flag (dropping you off, fine).", "NTA.\n\nA good way to not get hired is to come into the interview with a parent - it makes the employer assume they'll have to deal with that parent calling them any time there is a minor issue at work, rather than having the actual person deal with it themselves.", "NTA.

Better to start now.", "NTA. Her being there WILL cost you the job. No hiring manager wants to put up with that.", "NTA. \n\nWhat would happen if you got the job?

You\u2019re an adult now, so act like it.", "NTA. Mom needs to accept that you will make your way in the world yourself. I thought it was very caring and respectful by you to indulge her feelings on this but coming along to the office building is over the top.", "NTA, your mother needs to stay home.

What she might tell you is \u2018concern\u2019 is actually her sabotaging your adult life, that is not wanting \u2018the best\u2019 for you.

Going inside is a huge no and quite frankly, if I saw an interviewee walk in (not a minor) with a parent, that\u2019d be a big red flag and I\u2019d be a lot less likely to ire them.

Can you imagine if you had to document an issue or take disciplinary action against them? And mommy shows up to argue with you? No thanks. I\u2019ve had this type of thing happen with people who were hired prior to my taking that aspect of the job over. Lawyers were called, security had bolo posters, the whole works. I\u2019m not a kindergarten teacher, I don\u2019t need to deal with helicopter parents.", "I came here to say this.  I can just imagine.  His first annual performance review, and he doesn't get as good a rating as his mom likes, and she calls his supervisor to complain.", "From what the post says, OP is trying to do exactly that, hence the question to begin with.", "I  said something similar to a 21 year old. He brought mom, dad and girlfriend and introduced them all, strike 1(ok, foul ball).  Mom and girlfriend followed us  back to my office, strike 2.

We are 2 miles from the airport and this is restricted airspace. All these helicopters are going to get me in trouble with the FAA and I don't need those type of problems. \"  Genius  had the nerve to ask me if he got the job and when I said we didn't even start the interview he was dumbfounded.", "This. If any candidate relied on their parents for any part of the process (besides needing a ride maybe) they would be out. \n\nEither the parent WILl be insane and show up and do shit or they got zero independency and neither is desirable. \n\nShe means well but show her this thread, or any other thread, or twits or linkedin posts or articles that all say \u201cmommy at interview is no-go\u201d", "I would also cancel the interview.", "\u2026and I answered the question. NTA.\n\nCompromising in this scenario seems more like letting the overbearing Mama Bear get her way in the end. They have a way of wearing you down. What should happen is she stays home and does her thing while OP goes to the interview by themselves so they actually have a chance at landing a job."]}
