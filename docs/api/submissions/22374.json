I'm also a big fan of Taylor Swift, but def not as much as my friend.\nThe moment Taylor Swift announced she'd be going to Singapore, my friend started saving money. We aren't from Singapore, so she'd have to pay for international airfare and the expensive air bnb's of Singapore. She would sometimes skip a meal or walk to work to save money. Sometimes, I'd treat her to fast food or offer to pay just so she could save. \nI'm nowhere near rich, but I'm still a little better off than my friend. \nI, too, planned on registering for a ticket and going to Singapore if I got a ticket, but I planned to borrow money from my brother and pay him back slowly.\nWhen the codes were released, neither of us got them. She cried and cried. I was a little saddened, but I knew the chances of getting a code were really slim. Because I expected not to get one, I was saddened but not DEVASTATED. \nTwo days later, my boyfriend calls me and tells me he got me a ticket to Taylor Swift's concert. It's VIP1. He tells me he's paying for everything and to go to the concert next year. My boyfriend isn't rich. I know he worked hard to earn the money for this, so I told him I'd take the ticket but I'll handle the airfare and accommodations. He persisted to pay for everything, but relented to me paying after I insisted.\nI was ELATED. After days of telling myself not to expect--not to hope--and then suddenly getting a paid ticket to Taylor Swift was incredible!\nI told my sister and she posted it all over social media, excited for me. \nAnd then my friend saw it. She came to my house and begged to buy the ticket from me. She told me that she'd pay almost thrice the amount of the ticket (she was going to give me the money she saved for the Singapore trip as well and then save some more). But I declined. I informed her that maybe others would be willing to sell theirs for her price but she had already tried and they were selling it for over 10x the original price. \nShe then got upset saying that I never worked as hard as her, that she was the one providing me updates about ticket releases and searching for the latest news. She told me about how she took more shifts at work and got part-time jobs while I just relaxed (my job is pretty chill, tbh) and \"hoped for the best\". She cried and begged some more, but when she saw I wasn't budging, she stormed out.\nMy mom is also trying to convince me to sell it because it's a lot of money.\nI asked my boyfriend and told him about his offer. He says that he got me the ticket because he knew it would make me happy. So if the money gets me happier, then I should take it. If the ticket makes me happier, I should keep it. \nLater, a mutual friend called me and suggested I just sell it to her as she really did work hard and it was her lifelong dream, but I really want to go too. \nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit: I'm not going with my boyfriend. He couldn't afford two tickets and expenses for two people in Singapore. He chose to buy one ticket and to finance my trip. I insisted on paying for my own trip and I will, but it's too late to get a second ticket for him as it is sold out. He MIGHT go with me if work allows it.", "created_utc": 1689490094, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/150z1zj/aita_for_not_selling_my_taylor_swift_concert/", "score": 238, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And mother--a mother who prioritizes this friend more than her daughter, just sucks.  Mutual friend--not so much your friend.\n\nAbout the only way this would be acceptable on Mother/Mutual friend's part is if TSFan was Dying and this was her last wish.     So tell her to provide a note from doctor explaining she has months to live and then agree to the 3x.     s/\n\nI Get that TSwift is popular, but people need to be getting a life(this is addressing every reddit post on AITA I've seen in the last year.)\n\nGo experience the joy of Singapore and the ecstasy of a Taylor Swift Concert.  If you can afford it--bring back some swag from Friend(if you are still friends).", "NTA.  Your boyfriend did something nice for you and you deserve to enjoy it.  I bet if your friend had been able to get a ticket in the ticket lottery and you hadn't, your friend would have no problem going.", "NTA. You didn't buy the ticket, it was purchased and gifted to you. Your friend has no claim on it at all, I don't give a crap how hard she \"worked for it\". Life's not fair sometimes. Get over it.", "I was so confused at the beginning like \"What does this have to do with the Original post????\" And then I realised what you meant\ud83d\udc80", "I mean I've watched some clips of the concerts and it looks over the top amazing. And I think a lot of the songs that aren't just the pop songs (\"shake it off\") are lyrically very good. But a lot of those songs aren't what people hear on the radio or on the internet so they just write her off. (Plus female artists get written off a lot more often than male ones...)", "i\u2019m 23 and don\u2019t get it either. so overrated", "This is such a generous gift from your boyfriend- and I do hope you guys end up doing the trip part together. It honestly would be so insulting, in my humble opinion, to sell the ticket when he did so much work and sacrificed so much for you. Go, have all the fun, and hopefully hit the markets with boyfriend for some good food and an amazing experience.", "Probably one of my favs is No Body, No Crime\n\nit's atmospheric and I adore the story progression. how the chorus changes slightly with each verse\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEPomqor2A8", "I\u2019m a 24 year old woman who has been listening to Taylor Swift since her first album came out when I was 7. A lot of peers of mine are in the same position, and that\u2019s why they love her so much. Her music saw them through their formative years.", "I don\u2019t remember people being this crazy with Madonna. Maybe the internet has changed things?", "As a swiftie, some people just won\u2019t get it lol\n\nGo!!! Enjoy!!!", "Maybe it didn\u2019t feel that crazy because *there was no Internet back then* so there were no soc med bandwagons to hop on to, or communities that enable, exacerbate and reinforce the fandom. I assure you, I absolutely remember Ticketmaster issues, ticket lotteries, and crazy asf fanatic fans back in the late 80s and early 90s. Like with MJ. \n\nI miss pre-Internet / pre-smartphone concert culture", "It's now a status thing to see these acts. I talked to a woman last night who saw some big country act in San Diego, paid 1000 dollars for 2 seats. I guess us middle aged people and our parents got lucky. I saw all my favorite bands for about 30 bucks. I mean this is the friend's life long dream, is to see Taylor Swift? It's a sad state of affairs. But hey, NTA, her ticket. End of", "My Gen X neighbor dressed in the Madonna / Cindy Lauper style throughout the 80s and into the early 90s. We just didn't have internet and camera phones to document it.", "Exactly. And I remember when NKOTB was at the height of their popularity. If you were lucky enough to have tickets to their concert you only had like, five friends to brag about it to, lol, not a whole giant community of thousands to inflate the ego. So being into NKOTB didn\u2019t take over our whole personality, for the rest of our lives."]}
