Me, my friend and her boyfriend were all dressed in cosplay for the event as we enjoyed to cosplay during our free time together. After the event, my friend had suggested to take a simple photoshoot as it had been awhile since we\u2019ve cosplayed together as a group. I agreed to it and my boyfriend was also okay with the idea so we headed out to a proper venue for a photoshoot.\n\nDuring the photoshoot , my friend\u2019s boyfriend was trying out different ways to take our pictures. One of which was trying out the \u201cPanorama\u201d feature on his phone. I agreed to be the one he tries this method on and when we took a look at the results, we all bursted into a fit of laughter. It was genuinely a silly and innocent joke and I was in on laughing at how ridiculous I looked. The panorama had warped my image into looking like a default Roblox character. \n\nMy boyfriend then asked if he could have the picture for himself on his phone. Initially, I thought it would be something he kept to himself as some sort of silly inside joke, so I agreed for it to be sent. I would have never agreed to it if what happened next didn\u2019t occur at all.\n\nWhen it was my friend\u2019s boyfriend turn to take pictures, I was standing next to my boyfriend when I saw my picture in a private chat with one of his own friends. At that time, I didn\u2019t think to tell him what he did because I felt that it was funny, but after much thought, I did not like that he had shared images of me without my knowledge.\n\nAfter the day had ended, I decided to approach him with the situation and told him that I did not like how he was willing to act on sending pictures of me to his friends without my consent to which he responded with \u201cI just thought it was funny\u201d. I explained to him that I felt that it was not fair of him to be doing that as he himself had expressed how he would prefer if I consulted him on the pictures I post or send to others. I then asked him if he liked that I was passed around since he likes to do anything he pleases with my photos. He was taken aback and asked where the relation was and I explained to him again why I felt like he was breaching my trust for him. \n\nHe apologised and said he wouldn\u2019t do it again, but mentioned that I also did something like this a few days ago when I texted my friend that he was crying over a bad haircut he had. I had told him my intentions sending that message was not to ridicule him but to ask for advice instead as I was unsure on how to console him at that situation. He still believes what I did was as bad as what he did today and I can\u2019t help but get hurt about it. AITAH?\n\nEdit: hey guys, I\u2019ve realised what my mistakes were with regards to the situation and I\u2019ve brought it up to my boyfriend with how I reacted. He mentions that none of it was with ill intentions and that he just wanted to share fond memories with his close friends about his own girlfriend. He understands about how he didn\u2019t respect the boundaries set prior to the situation and he apologised for his actions. I\u2019ve also told him how my behaviour was impulsive and I did not mean to warrant distaste for my perspectives of the situation. I apologised for my mistakes and I shared that I would love to communicate things better with him in the future.

So many people still do not fully understand consent, and that's incredibly disappointing. You were well within your rights to be upset by him sending the picture and communicating that to him. Of course he tried to minimize it with the \"I just thought it was funny\", as if your feelings are irrelevant.\n\nI also don't think mentioning his reaction to a bad haircut to a friend to be equal to sharing the picture. However, it's important that you acknowledge that it bothered him and agree to discuss with him in the future. It's also not helpful for either of you to be attempting to keep score or determine which was worse. I think apologizing to him might go a long way towards opening him up to listening to your concerns.", "Oh yea... yta", "Yta. You are getting angry over him breaking a rule he didn't know was in place.  This was an over reaction.  Ask him not to do it again but let it go.  It was innocent and your hypocrisy is showing.", "YTA do it\u2019s ok for you to send messages about him crying to your friends but it\u2019s not okay for him to send an innocent funny pic?", "YTA-\n\n\nIn this day and age consent for images of a non adult nature is pretty much not even an option or something thought of it seems.  \n\n\nYou overreacted (it sounds like) and a simple \u201cplease don\u2019t post pictures of me without my consent\u201d is fair and fine and then he says \u201csorry\u201d and you both move on with your day; respectful of the other.", "YTA, they're easily equal, especially since it wasn't a sexual pic. Forgive each other and move on.", "YTA, I'd run for the hills if I had to walk on eggshells to not get my SO angry while she did the same and dismissed it entirely when brought to her attention.", "YTA u sending pictures of him during a vulnerable moment is 1000% times worse than what he did. People wonder why men don\u2019t cry, it\u2019s cause people like you can\u2019t help but share pictures of it", "INFO: We\u2019re these pictures at all sexual in nature? Because you\u2019re acting like they are. I can\u2019t imagine the harm in sharing a funny photo of you to his friends.", "Did you actually compare him charing a funny picture of you with a friend to you being passed around like a sexual object? That\u2019s a very gross overreaction imo. YTA for that comment.", "Nta", "YTA\n\nI understand that you didn't like it but then just say \"hey for future reference, don't do that again.\" You allowed to tell him no.\n\nBut you took it to the best level and created a massive fight. It was a silly picture. And ps, don't tell random people your bf was crying over a haircut. All you had to say, \"my bf hates his new haircut. Any suggestions?\" I would also be pissed if you told me I was crying.\n\n\nYou two need to have honest, calm conversations with each other without starting a massive fight.", "ESH He\u2019s an AH for requiring consent before you share a photo of him. You\u2019re an AH for deciding to get mad even though I\u2019m pretty sure the sharing of photos doesn\u2019t bother you, AND you were virtually unrecognizable in the photo he shared.\n\nSounds like your bf is somewhat controlling, and this is your way of pushing back.", "YTA. You're 100% allowed to say that you'd rather he didn't send pictures of you without asking - some people *would* be fine with it, but you're not and that's OK. What's not OK is this:\n\n>I then asked him if he liked that I was passed around since he likes to do anything he pleases with my photos.\n\nYou blew it totally out of proportion. If you're not OK with it, you politely let him know for future reference and move on. There's no need for you to attack him for it and make bizarre comparisons like that, just communicate the boundary and be done with it.", "I\u2019ve literally never heard of anyone suggesting that you need \u201cconsent\u201d in order to share non-sexual pictures with others. \n\nYou invented this requirement, nobody else has heard of it. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\nYou brought up the fact that he had previously expressed to you that he did want you sending out pictures of him without you asking first. But it appears that it wasn't until AFTER he had sent this picture that you expressed you desire for him to ask permission. What was he suppose to do, go back in time and unsend the picture?\n\nThe fact that he HAD asked you to respect his desire on this topic did not mean he should have assumed that you felt the same way about pictures of you. And if you did feel that way then when he asked you to not send out pictures would have been a perfect time for you to tell him you felt the same way.\n\nIt appears that it was this specific picture you didn't want shared, and even then you didn't come to this conclusion until 'after MUCH thought'.", "NAH.  there are so many other things you should care about.  harmless pictures aren\u2019t it.", "YTA.  Why is it ok for you to send messages about his vulnerabilities, but it's not ok for him to send a silly picture.  Stop being so melodramatic.", "I didn\u2019t send any picture of him to my friends, none without his permission. I simply asked my friend how to help console him, no specific descriptions no pictures no nothing, just a vague question.", "INFO: why do people not read the post but instead ask for INFO that was clearly already given?\n\nOP spent literally the first two paragraphs carefully explaining the exact nature of the photo in question.", "Yeah more info is required for judgment because it sounds like these were very private photos or she is very private in general and doesnt like public photos", "It was a funny photo.", "They were taken in a public place, to test the panoramic feature of his camera, and she looked \"Like a default roblox character\" in them (her words).", "did you read the post", "I understand that it was completely unnecessary for be to say that and I agree I was in the wrong, I just felt like my boundaries were not being respected as I have mentioned how I was wary of people\u2019s perspectives of me", "My brother is a very private person and hates his photo being shared. Even for a photo at a birthday party I had to ask first. Just saying, it's a thing.", "I did create that boundary with him on sharing things about me for quite some time into the relationship. I also respect his boundaries as my boyfriend whether or not his photos are shared as well. The whole day felt hard to keep up which is why I was only able to express my hurt after the situation happened. It was the fact that I build that boundary and still felt like I was being disrespected. I played my part in informing him what I could and couldn\u2019t handle.", "Sorry I misread.", "Yeah, her reaction is understandable if they were explicit, because it\u2019s common knowledge not to share explicit photos without consent. There\u2019s not really any such unspoken rule about photos that are simply funny.", "Yep. \n1) Silly photo is taken.\n\n2) OP initially unbothered when she sees that bf forwarded silly photo in a private chat\n\n3) \u201cAfter much thought\u201d OP decides she\u2019s mad about her bf\u2019s photo-sharing bc she remembers that bf has rigid boundaries surrounding OP sharing photos or really ANY information about him\n\n4) Arguments over which partner\u2019s behavior is worse ensue.\n\nIn short, OP decides to passive-aggressively push back against bf\u2019s rigid, controlling nature.\n\nWhich bit did I miss?", "Had you communicated that boundary previously, and explicitly mentioning photos? Sometimes we don't know that something is a boundary until it is crossed and it can hurt more than we expect, but maintaining level communication in those moments is vital. And this goes both ways, of course. It sounds like you both are unsure of what the other is OK with in terms of sharing details with friends, and it is something that would benefit from some thought on and having a constructive and understanding discussion about so that it's clearer. And of course more things will come up in future, but working on creating a space where you can each talk through hurt feelings without attacking each other is essential for a good relationship.\n\nOf course, if a boundary is crossed repeatedly when it has already been set then there are deeper issues that need addressing.", "It is a good thing to be aware of how your behavior/ attitude can influence how you are seen & be a \"good\" person \n\nBut being on guarded or cautious of how others perceive you doesn't seem very healthy & more of a you problem to address to be healthier \n\nWorrying about how people think of you is not worth it. If you can understand early in life that there is only probably a handful of people in your life whose opinion actually does matter, it might can help you focus & remember who is important , well, learning that earlier is my wish for myself \n\nGood luck n be blessed with lots of love in your life", "Yeah, with certain people who have made it clear to you. But as a general thing, no. \n\nYou pose for a group picture it\u2019s generally assumed that it\u2019s going to be shared. Nobody asks for permission for photos like that.", "What about not liking your photo shared without consent makes him an AH?\n\nExplain it like I'm 5.", "So why is he an AH for requiring consent?"]}
