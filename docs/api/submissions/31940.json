I will go and apologize to her tomorrow after work. As many of you have pointed out there is more to our relationship than what is shown here. There was never any abuse but I was the walking \u201ctrophy\u201d of her being a good person and adopting an orphaned child. I had to look a certain way, act a certain way, and maintain a certain body to make sure I looked \u201csaved\u201d I always did what was asked no questions, because I owed her. After I moved out we had lunch once a month until I became pregnant. She has been highly involved since then. Bob is a saint and I\u2019d die for him. We\u2019ve had breakfast every Sunday morning since I\u2019ve moved out. \nI have never viewed Linda as mom but I do view Bob as a dad. \n\nSo backstory, my dad died when I was 9 and my mom when I was 15. After my mom died my godmother adopted me. She calls herself and her husband my mom and dad. I call them mom and dad to strangers who don\u2019t know the story, but to them and friends I call them by their name. They will be called Linda and Bob for this story. We generally get along and don\u2019t typically have issues. \n\nNow for the story. My husband (26M) and I (25F) had our first child five months ago. We are pretty lax first time parents in my opinion. We\u2019ve let people hold her as long as they\u2019ve washed their hands since she was born. We have drawn a hard line that no one\u2019s mouth gets near her, like I don\u2019t even want your breath hitting her. We\u2019ve had issues with Linda (62F) not respecting that. She is constantly trying to kiss her cheeks or putting my baby\u2019s hands in her mouth. I have told her time and time again that this is not acceptable and I don\u2019t want my child getting sick. I\u2019ve shown her the videos of other babies with rsv and covid. She always agrees and says she won\u2019t do it anymore. My daughter and I went to her house for lunch this last Sunday and while she was holding my daughter I went to the restroom. While in there I head Bob (64M) gasp and say Linda\u2019s name. When I came out and asked what happened Linda gave Bob the look of \u201cyou better keep your mouth shut\u201d. Bob immediately tells me that Linda kissed my daughter on the mouth. I snatched my baby back and started loading her in the car seat to leave. Linda starts trying to get me to stay saying we haven\u2019t even eaten etc. I refuse to stay and tell her she won\u2019t be holding my daughter for a long time. She then says \u201cIt\u2019s just a kiss from Grammy, it\u2019s not going to hurt anything\u201d I start yelling \u201c ITS NOT A GRAMMY KISS, ITS A STRANGER KISS. YOU ARE NOT RELATED TO HER, YOU SHARE NOTHING BIOLOGICALLY WITH HER\u201d and stormed out of the house.  My husband says I\u2019m not wrong but I could have nicer about it. I called Bob and he says Linda deserved it and it was the only way she\u2019d stop. All my friends though, say I was being too mean and should have left without pointing out she\u2019s not really related.", "created_utc": 1701197221, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1863do2/aita_for_throwing_the_fact_that_my_adoptive_mom/", "score": 2059, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You went from 0 to 1.000 in a minute and you fully intended to hurt her deeply. That is very assholish of you. I agree that she is ignoring your boundaries, so you were totally justified on calling her out on that or telling her she is not going to see the baby until she is older, but the fact that phrase was the first thing out of your mouth in a moment of frustration with her is very mean on your part if you didn't have any other problem with her.

I agree there which is why I didn\u2019t address it. \n\nI\u2019m arguing against grandma *not* being intentionally risky to the child and dismissive/hurtful to OP. \n\nI\u2019m firmly ESH on this one.", "I mean, OP admitted to being an asshole. OP's adoptive parents could be both loving and supportive, and having been making OP look a certain way growing up. One thing that can't be denied is that OP's mother certainly hasn't got problems stomping over boundaries, and could have possibly been worse whilst OP was growing up, especially how she tried to hide the fact she kissed OP's baby, on the mouth no less, after being told again and again that was off limits behaviour.\n\nI feel like this is being glossed over: OP was an AH for her hurtful words, and certainly shouldn't expect her mother to be a babysitter any time soon, but OP's mother was a bigger AH for blatantly disregarding a boundary regarding the baby's health, then downplaying it as \"just a kiss from grandma, it's not going to hurt anyone\" when yes, it can potentially hurt the baby.", "Okay, sure, defend adoptive and foster parents if you want. In my experience most are trash.\n\nKids don\u2019t need to be grateful for basic things.", "it really doesn't take a genius to read \"she calls herself and her husband my mom and dad\" and \"to them and friends I call them by their name\" and deduce that there's likely a deeper issue...", "I mean some jobs don't make sense with masks. When covid first hit my husband worked in an aluminum factory. They stopped making people wear masks because someone's caught fire on thier face. Especially the blue ones the job originally handed out. \n\nAir cleaners probably wouldn't work there given the sheer size of the building? Idk I'm not versed beyond our room air purifiers. Maybe just break rooms?\n\nMy husband works in a warehouse now. He still wears a mask because it helps with his asthma but it freezes to his face and facial hair over time.", "why are you putting \"'everybody' agrees\" in quotes as though I said that when I didn't? I'm saying you can't really argue that in just about any other context, what Grammy did would be defined as assault.\n\nI mean if we are using a strict legal definition (which aren't the only definitions that exist), it isn't assault, it's battery. unwanted kisses meet the criteria for battery in some states, regardless of sexual intent. again, I'm not suggesting that Grammy should be charged or that a lawyer would take the case. I'm just saying that what she did is deeply fucked up.\n\nI wonder... if it was grandpa and not grandma in question, would this thread look the same?"]}
