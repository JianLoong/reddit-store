I will go and apologize to her tomorrow after work. As many of you have pointed out there is more to our relationship than what is shown here. There was never any abuse but I was the walking \u201ctrophy\u201d of her being a good person and adopting an orphaned child. I had to look a certain way, act a certain way, and maintain a certain body to make sure I looked \u201csaved\u201d I always did what was asked no questions, because I owed her. After I moved out we had lunch once a month until I became pregnant. She has been highly involved since then. Bob is a saint and I\u2019d die for him. We\u2019ve had breakfast every Sunday morning since I\u2019ve moved out. \nI have never viewed Linda as mom but I do view Bob as a dad. \n\nSo backstory, my dad died when I was 9 and my mom when I was 15. After my mom died my godmother adopted me. She calls herself and her husband my mom and dad. I call them mom and dad to strangers who don\u2019t know the story, but to them and friends I call them by their name. They will be called Linda and Bob for this story. We generally get along and don\u2019t typically have issues. \n\nNow for the story. My husband (26M) and I (25F) had our first child five months ago. We are pretty lax first time parents in my opinion. We\u2019ve let people hold her as long as they\u2019ve washed their hands since she was born. We have drawn a hard line that no one\u2019s mouth gets near her, like I don\u2019t even want your breath hitting her. We\u2019ve had issues with Linda (62F) not respecting that. She is constantly trying to kiss her cheeks or putting my baby\u2019s hands in her mouth. I have told her time and time again that this is not acceptable and I don\u2019t want my child getting sick. I\u2019ve shown her the videos of other babies with rsv and covid. She always agrees and says she won\u2019t do it anymore. My daughter and I went to her house for lunch this last Sunday and while she was holding my daughter I went to the restroom. While in there I head Bob (64M) gasp and say Linda\u2019s name. When I came out and asked what happened Linda gave Bob the look of \u201cyou better keep your mouth shut\u201d. Bob immediately tells me that Linda kissed my daughter on the mouth. I snatched my baby back and started loading her in the car seat to leave. Linda starts trying to get me to stay saying we haven\u2019t even eaten etc. I refuse to stay and tell her she won\u2019t be holding my daughter for a long time. She then says \u201cIt\u2019s just a kiss from Grammy, it\u2019s not going to hurt anything\u201d I start yelling \u201c ITS NOT A GRAMMY KISS, ITS A STRANGER KISS. YOU ARE NOT RELATED TO HER, YOU SHARE NOTHING BIOLOGICALLY WITH HER\u201d and stormed out of the house.  My husband says I\u2019m not wrong but I could have nicer about it. I called Bob and he says Linda deserved it and it was the only way she\u2019d stop. All my friends though, say I was being too mean and should have left without pointing out she\u2019s not really related.", "created_utc": 1701197221, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1863do2/aita_for_throwing_the_fact_that_my_adoptive_mom/", "score": 1189, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You went from 0 to 1.000 in a minute and you fully intended to hurt her deeply. That is very assholish of you. I agree that she is ignoring your boundaries, so you were totally justified on calling her out on that or telling her she is not going to see the baby until she is older, but the fact that phrase was the first thing out of your mouth in a moment of frustration with her is very mean on your part if you didn't have any other problem with her.

They say that shit to the people they love and trust most. They say that shit to *their safe people,* whom they trust to forgive them.\n\nNow, obviously, behavior is an unmet need and they both clearly need some therapy, both individual and family, to work out better communication and build stronger boundaries, but yeah.

OP loves her baby just as Linda loves her, wants to keep her safe, and perhaps didn't get the best early childhood training in 'set the expectations well in advance, communicate clearly and firmly, be consistent,' and has to rely on dang near abusive communication to keep weakly-built boundaries held.

Taking the baby away, even leaving, and limiting future contact  were all within bounds\u2026.saying those words to Linda were totally uncalled for and just mean and cruel.

She didn't forget; she knew that OP had health concerns, dismissed them, and continued the behavior behind OP's back. When caught, she dismissed the concerns *again* with something absolutely idiotic -- like a grandmother can't pass on germs.
