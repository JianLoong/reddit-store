You set a boundary and he\u2019s being rude and disrespectful. You have every right to not want your photo taken. He\u2019s trying to guilt trip you into letting him do what he wants.", "NTA\n\nWow, what kind of non-abusive parent calls their kid an \"ungrateful little shit\" for any reason whatsoever, let alone for setting and enforcing a simple and very reasonable boundary? \n\nAnswer: none, good parents don't act this way", "NTA\n\nIt's rude as hell to shove a camera in someone's face when they already said no. But then to act like a petulant child and sulk over it? He's TA for sure. \n\nYou mentioned your parents are divorced and you don't like going over there anyway. When I was a teen I didn't go to my dad's for sleepovers for a few years as he used to like to party hard and I couldn't sleep due to how loud it would get. Once he settled down and stopped that crap, I started seeing him more. My point is, you may be old enough to say you no longer want to go over there as much. He certainly doesn't respect your boundaries at all.", "Dad sucks. Calling your kid names is shitty.", "NTA. No is a complete sentence. You don't have to have an extenuating circumstance to not want to be the subject of this photograph. You can simply not like it, and that should be respected.", "NTA.\n\nAfter a few months of reading on Reddit, I seriously wonder where all the grown people have gone?\nAnd especially people who are parents.", "How many photos does he usually want? like one or two per day?", "NTA.

That's very strange behavior and you are NTA.", "NTA, you shouldn't be forced to take photos, especially since you only agreed to take one photo. I don't understand how he can be upset after he knew that you only wanted to take one picture beforehand", "ESH, your dad has a passion and you keep on shooting him down when he wants to share it with you.\n\nI do think he shouldn't have insulted you, but he must've hated not being able to take pictures of you. I highly doubt he wanted to make you uncomfortable; however, it was pretty uncalled for to keep on trying to take a picture of you.\n\nNot saying you were in the wrong, just tryna explain a theoretical reason on his side of the argument.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I want to start off by saying that you have a right to set personal boundaries. \n\nBUT- YTA for how you decided to go about handling your personal boundaries. Your communication style sounds a bit abrupt and alienating, while also not providing context for others to how you're feeling. It would make more sense for you to politely tell your dad why you don't want your picture taken. \n\nEx \"dad I only feel comfortable being in one photo of the family today because one thing I've learned about myself is that candid photos make me feel uncomfortable, and honestly I'm not really in the mood today I hope you can understand.\" \n\nBut instead of doing that you just lash out and criticize. So YTA", "NTA, but try to relax about the photos. You don't have to look at them if you don't want to. Too much is too much, but these will be priceless memories one day.

You definitely don\u2019t have to tolerate this, and he needs to stop being this way if he wants you to have a good relationship with him. If I were in your shoes and my dad did this, I\u2019d refuse to go back to his house, so I totally understand where you\u2019re coming from and you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "Op, you sound pretty mature. I don\u2019t know how old you are, but can\u2019t you be in your room so your mom can have alone time or hang out at a friend\u2019s house? Talk to your mom. Tell her there are other options.", "You can just tell him not to. And if he won't listen, he can't take any more photos of you. If he still won't listen, tell him you will start commenting under the photos that he puts on Facebook that you explicitly asked him not to post it. You can also tell him to remove the ones he already posted using this. Trust me, putting parents on blast in their own circles is super effective when they cross boundaries.", "You are definitely NTA. The only solution I can think of is that you just don't let it bother you. it's the most practical one. You can talk to him but for some reason, I don't think he will listen to you.\n\nI can suggest that maybe you sit with him and tell him that he can take pictures of you but it should be an x amount of time per day. Perhaps twice a day?\n\nYour father is enjoying something a lot and it makes him VERY happy and I understand it's very annoying to you but ya know, he is your father. He will do anything for you if roles were reversed, don't you think? good luck \\^\\^", "If you look at their comment history you can see they come off a bit trollish. Don't worry about it", "I mean, I definitely agree. I am not on Facebook and my mom takes candid pictures of me and puts them on Facebook and it makes me so upset. But I guess the difference I'm trying to point out is just the basic level of communication that allows other people to understand where you're coming from, and to provide context for why you want to set those boundaries. Because if you don't then it'll be easy for people to walk over you, and you'll just continue to feel frustrated.", "Don\u2019t listen to them OP you told him no many times when one should have been enough!

I've had to deal with something similar with my mom so I get it and I've had to sit down and have conversations with her. \n\nI rescind my yta, if you have had conversations with him about this in the past. My only advice I guess would be to just keep the conversation going until it really sinks in and he starts to understand. I have had to have multiple conversations with my mom about posting pictures of me on Facebook. They think it's innocent and they don't see any harm in it, but once I told my mom that it was literally an invasion of my privacy she understood and stopped.", "i don\u2019t particularly like going to his house anyways, his girlfriend is his main priority", "Yep \"I am a minor and I do NOT consent to having my photo published. Please remove this photo.\" Over and over again until it stops.\n\nAlso, my friends and I have a fun thing we do, whenever someone points a camera at us and we don't want to take a photo we put our hands straight toward the lens and say with Italian accent \"No paparazzi!\" Imagine you are Sofia Loren saying it. Trust me, it gets the message across and stops all arguing, usually with a little laugh too.", "i haven\u2019t thought of commenting on his facebook, thanks for the advice :)", "i\u2019ve said he can when i\u2019m dressed properly and not in pyjamas or eating but this makes him sulk like you said it might, he just likes things his way, it\u2019s gotten worse since he moved in with his gf unfortunately", "ah i didn\u2019t see, thanks :)", "thank you! my dad doesn\u2019t respect basic boundaries like knocking before entering my room or checking if anyone\u2019s in the bathroom before opening the door (there\u2019s no lock)", "unfortunately, i have told him many times as well as my mom actually messaging him about it (she rarely messages him unless it\u2019s an emergency as she hates my dad) and he just says i\u2019m \u201cbeing a moody teenager\u201d or just brushes it off, i will keep reminding him though and hopefully i\u2019ll make a breakthrough someday with him!", "Question Do you not like having your picture taken in general, or is it because your dad takes pictures constantly?", "i generally don\u2019t like having my picture taken due to things like body dysmorphia and general anxiety based things and i feel like when people take photos i look awful in all of them but it makes it worse since he doesn\u2019t listen to whether i consent or not and it makes me paranoid to be careful what i\u2019m doing in my own home due to random photos been taken, he also posts the pictures to facebook publicly", "I see, and trust me I understand.  I'm not sure why your dad is being so disrespectful to you,  but apparently he's not going to stop no matter what. What I would do is start taking pictures of him all of the time. Give him a taste of his own medicine and see how he feels. Either way, your dad is a total AH.", "My sympathies. My mother was camera happy and made my body issues so much worse. The FB posting makes it even worse."]}
