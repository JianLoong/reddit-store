She loves it so much that she asked to see a Cirque du Soleil show as a birthday present. My husband (37M) and I managed to get discount tickets to take her and three of her friends from circus school on a 2-hour drive to catch the nearest show.\n\nWhen I got there I checked the company credits and noticed a friend of mine, an acrobat from Belgium, was one of the performers. I hadn\u2019t see him in years and sent him a message on Instagram just to say I was in the audience with my daughter and excited to see him. He replied almost immediately and told me to look for a stage manager after the show so we could say hi and I could take my daughter backstage. And so I did - since he only invited my daughter and I (I didn\u2019t mention in my short message there were three other girls + my husband, and I couldn\u2019t impose taking a small party backstage), my husband waited with the girls for about 20 min after the show was over while we toured backstage.\n\nMy daughter was so happy! Yet she kept talking about it on the way home and that\u2019s when I realized the other girls could be feeling left out. What do you know? The same night one of the girls\u2019 mother called me, to say her daughter came home crying because she didn\u2019t get to go backstage and that it was very poor form on my part to invite them to a party and to exclude them from one of the experiences. I tried to explain how things played out, but she kept being aggressive - until I finally lost it and told her she had no right to call me and try to reprimand me and should instead have a talk to her daughter about how to deal with such frustrations. My husband says I should not have instigated and that, in hindsight, I shouldn\u2019t have split the party.

You could've simply informed your friend that you were in the company of your daughter's friends and left it up to him to decide. You also could've explained to your daughter not to keep talking about that with her friends there, so they won't feel left out.  That simple; if you really, really felt the need to only take your kid and not the others. \n\nInstead, you did in fact leave 3 other kids out, you allowed your daughter to brag about what she alone got to do, and you're surprised a bunch of 6-year-olds felt left out. You then double down on the one mom who wanted to defend her kids' feelings. Yes, YTA.", "YTA\n\nIt was your idea to go and take your daughter and her friends (who apparently must all have been 6yo), you contacted your friend which was fine, but when he invited you and your daughter you took it on your own to determine IF he could take the others and you jumped at going without the others.  You could have said \"Hey thanks but I'm here with 3 of my daughters friend and my husband, so I don't know if we all can come in, or if you and I can just say hello.\"  You opted for what was easiest, an invite for yourself and your daughter.   Your husband is correct, you should not split the party, since you were the one that put the party together.  You know your daughter would have been heartbroken if the situation was switched where another mother took her daughter to an even t that meant the world to her and then she was told to wait outside while that mother took her daughter in to meet the performers and see behind the scenes.  You probably should apologize to all of the girls and their mothers.  It was a nice thought to take everyone, but you BLEW IT BIG TIME abandoning the others for yours and your daughter's benefit.", "YTA - The other child's mother was 100% correct, you don't invite children to an event and then make them wait while only your child gets to experience the best part of the event. And then you have the audacity to tell the other mother how to parent her child in response to your hurting her child's feelings, wild! Hope you have that lesson down pat for your own daughter, for when you will be teaching her how to deal with her frustrations when she is not invited to other children's events because of your actions.", "NTA\n\nit was your daughters birthday, of course she\u2019s getting special treatment. it is not OP\u2019s obligation to make sure every 6 y/o she took with her had the same experience, why you might ask? because it was her DAUGHTERS BIRTHDAY. Imagine going to your friend\u2019s birthday party, going to an expensive circus show (cirque Du Soleil isn\u2019t cheap!!) and then going back home and crying to your mom because the birthday girl got to do more stuff than you did. Well yeah because it\u2019s her fucking BIRTHDAY. \n\nAll the YTA comments baffle me. You aren\u2019t an asshole because you never promised to take the kids backstage, you never got their hopes up, you got an opportunity to do something special with your daughter and i don\u2019t think that makes you an AH at all. You\u2019re right, the other parent should work on making their kid not be so entitled, because that is entitled behavior.", "NTA, and frankly I am delighted by everything about you and your friend. You handled everything right. Don\u2019t stress the haters.", "NTA\n\nYou bought them all tickets.  The parents should be grateful that you took their kids to the event, instead of acting unhinged and entitled that their kids didn't also get VIP access.   It's your daughter's birthday.  Do you also need to buy all of the kids the same exact gifts when she opens presents?  I agree with another commenter that I would have told my child not to brag in front of the other kids, but that's about it.", "NTA\n\nWhy shouldn't the birthday girl get a bit extra?  Free show wasn't enough for her friend, that one shouldn't be invited next time IMO.", "NTA", "ESH. Yes it\u2019s your daughters birthday and that means she gets some special treatment, but at such a young age where kids tend to be more sensitive, you should have known better than to invite them to go with y\u2019all only to make them wait outside while you and your daughter did something they couldn\u2019t. \n\nThat being said, that other mom was WAY out of line. You and your husband paid for all the expenses to take her child to a fun event. She\u2019s acting entitled and ungrateful, and maybe in the future it would be best if you and your husband no longer paid for outings like this, but instead, had a small sleepover or party at home for your daughter and her friends, but saved special trips for just the three of you. If this mom asks why, tell her\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA \n\nFirstly those shows themselves are not cheap as I recall so the fact that these other girls got to go in the first place is already impressive in itself. Secondly this was the mums friend and it's the girl's birthday so she got 20 special minutes! Yes it's cool. Yes its a shame maybe the others didn't have that chance but I also get not wanting to try and invite another three kids along backstage. One kid is one thing a crowd of them after a tiring show is different especially when the other three are strangers.\n\n\nThe other kids already got a significant treat and it wasn't like they were standing around waiting they got ice cream and were watching another show. They are six and will get over it and it was entitled to ask for more when the mom was already generous to pay to take these kids in the first place \n\nCould a little more tact have been used in hindsight? Yes. But nothing egregious enough for a YTA.", "This is ridiculous. You\u2019re definitely NTA. Your daughter is 6, hardly at an age to be expected to navigate social nuances. You could have tried to tell her to keep it zipped but we all know that wouldn\u2019t have worked lol. \nI would have done the same thing with zero regrets and if anyone complained I would have been like \u201cand you\u2019re welcome for bringing them in the first place\u201d", "Against the grain, NTA. \nYou were nice enough to take the kids AND pay for it. \n\nYour daughter got an extra gift ON HER BIRTHDAY TRIP. \nIf ANYONE has a problem with that, tell them next time, their kids can stay home. \n\nI'd never expect someone to pay for my kids trip. Even if offered, let alone put extra perks, that elwere never on the table to begin with. That's where enetilement stems from. \n\nThe world isn't fair. Birthday girl got an extra gift. Kids will forget about it. Mom has a chip on her shoulder.", "Unpopular opinion apparently, NTA. There are birthday and life experiences that people get individually, and nobody is under any obligation to change that just to spare people's feelings. \n\nDuring a birthday, only the birthday kid gets to blow out the candles, unless the birthday kid specifically asks others to do it with them. They're under no obligation or pressure to change that and let others blow out their candles or help them blow the candles out. \n\nSame with presents. Only the birthday kid gets to open presents on their birthday. There is no obligation or pressure for the birthday kid to allow others to do so, or even help them. And we never say anything about kids that wave around brand new shiny toys or electronics on their birthdays and brag about them, but now it's wrong to brag about an experience that a birthday kid got on their birthday, specifically because it was their birthday nonetheless? Nope.\n\nYour daughter got to go backstage at a show that you took her to for her birthday. The whys and how's don't matter, since it could have been that you could have gotten her backstage passes for her birthday since she's the birthday kid and not gotten them for others. It wouldn't have mattered.", "I'm actually shocked at the YTAs, like seriously people? Get a grip. It's her daughter, it was HER trip, the other kids got to come and see a show. OP had NO obligation to bring the other kids backstage , when this wasn't a planned thing- it was a spur of the moment decision with someone she knows PERSONALY (they follow eachother a socials) OP made no promises to bringing the other kids back stage, and the gall of one parent to complain to another parent for something so fucking miniscule? OP is right, she should be putting that energy into teaching her daughter how to deal with being frustrated, NOT bitching to another mom bc the kid didn't get what they wanted.... actually delusional people pls don't have children :)\n\nNTA", "YTA.\n\nIm sure you knew the invitation backstage might not be forthcoming if it was a whole group of you, so you deliberately \"forgot to mention\" you were there with a party of people.  You do not invite a group out to celebrate with your daughter and then leave them hanging around for 20 minutes or so whilst you go off and do something else.\n\n As for you criticising the other childs parenting, well if my child came home upset from a party Id probably want to find out exactly what happened as well, and secondly, lets hope you are excellent at explaining to your daughter about how to deal with frustrations of that kind when she is upset that she doesnt receive invites to  other childrens parties, once word gets around of how you treated your own invited guests.", "Imma say NTA cause f*ck them kids, but on a serious note, ill get downvoted but i genuinely think putting your daughters happiness above others is valid, plus you are meeting an old friend, \ndo you know how awkward itd be if u asked for the rest to come along, It would feel as though youre trying to take advantage of \u201coh he\u2019s my friend! Lets all go backstage hehe\u201d personally, id feel super awkward and would prefer the reunion to be short and sweet backstage. Who cares, theyre 6-7 they\u2019ll forget. The mom is mad weird for calling though\n\nETA- typo", "NTA. It was 20 freaking minutes to show your daughter a once in a lifetime thing that's relevant to her special interests on her birthday. The kids were safe and still got a free night out paid by yourself. The other kid sounds like a spoiled brat, and her mother sounds entitled and enabling. Guaranteed the other kid won't remember not going backstage, but your daughter will remember this special opportunity.", "NTA \n\nYou paid for and provided a wonderful party for a group of small children. If your husband watched the other kids, I\u2019m hoping he knew where you were.\n\nThis would be different if you had purchased a VIP ticket for yourself and your daughter only, and had planned to do this. But this was a spontaneous interaction with an old friend.\n\nProbably the best way to sell this to the other kids\u2019 parents is that you had an unplanned visit with a colleague you had not seen in years, and while you were reconnecting they happened to show your daughter around because it was HER birthday. Sadly, you have to do that.\n\nAnd the other mom was way out of line.\n\nIf you\u2019re at an event and someone shoots a T-shirt to you out of a cannon, you don\u2019t throw it back because your friends didn\u2019t get a T-shirt shot at them.", "NTA of course you didn't wanna risk it it's a once in a life time experience", "NTA, not happy about being taken in the first place, this entitled little brat goes crying to her mom...well next year, don't even invite her...", "You were not the one who instigated anything.\n\nHer daughter had a lovely trip and the appropriate response is thank you.\n\nNTA", "Nta, it's actually kind of the point of a birthday party that the birthday girl gets special gifts/experiences just for her... And the baseline experience you were giving all the girls for free was still really great", "NTA, everyone doesn't have to be included in everything.  This is how entitlement is born.  Kids need to learn at a young age that life isn't fair and parents need to teach kids that not everyone always gets the same things and treatment.", "sounds like the girls got a free trip/show, NTA, 20mins aint that long to wait.", "NTA. You did the right thing by not looking a gift horse in the mouth, and the other kids were lucky just to have been brought along for the show.  Life isn't always equal, nor is it supposed to be.  And your daughter was the birthday girl, it was her day to get something a little extra.\n\nYour response to the other mother was probably a bit harsh but I understand the frustration from where it came.  Also, these are 6 year olds.  They cry when their friends get the purple jolly rancher and they got the pink one... they'll get over it.\n\nOn the plus side you may not have to treat her friends to amazing experiences anymore as it sounds like their helicopter parents will probably prevent them from seeing your kid again. Win win.", "It was 20min and could\u2019ve ended up being 5min. NTA.", "NTA. When I was in preschool we went to a circus. 90% of the kids got to ride elephants and such. I was able to get 1 bird whistle. Yes I felt left out and didn\u2019t understand why they could go and I couldn\u2019t. But that was life. Later I knew and it doesn\u2019t traumatize a child to not do everything others get to do!", "NTA.\n\nI'm sure this will be buried but you took an opportunity for your daughter. The other girls only had to wait for 20 minutes AND you paid for them to see an incredible show. Asking to have 6 people backstage is a HUGE jump from only 2 and I am with you on that. As a former performer, I absolutely would have felt imposed on to have invited one kid and gotten four.   \n\n\nThe other mom is in the wrong here. You were absolutely correct.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA to be honest. You could\u2019ve asked, but I get why you didn\u2019t want to. I also just don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal that your daughter got to do something cool on her birthday that her friends didn\u2019t t", "NTA - the fact is that life isn't fair and there is no point trying to pretend it is in front of kids. You daughter was the lucky one that time, and that's it.", "NTA. They literally got a trip to cirque du soleil.", "NTA. She's the birthday girl! Why is it weird that she got to have something special apart from the others? If it was a traditional birthday party would the parents have gotten mad that their kids didn't also get to open presents?", "NTA. It's not shocking the bday girl got something extra, and sounds like the other girls did too- cotton candy and the like that was at the front. Would've been different were they standing doing nothing, but they weren't.", "NTA.  Kids got a free show.  6 yo crying!  I'm SHOCKED!... as if they\u2019ll remember it next month.", "One thing is for sure, you're NTA to your daughter! \n\nYou didn't intentionally exclude them, say you're really sorry that it was just for her and you could have handled it better, then buy each girl a cuddly toy or gift if you want to smooth it over.\n\nIt was a bit of a fumble, but well intended. It's a very high level show and your thoughts that taking the whole family backstage might prevent your daughter from being able to experience it outweighed everything. You should have asked the question, you didn't. \n\nIf you're ever in a situation similar again (unlikely) you will most likely think to be more inclusive, or more considered about how you explain it to the people that will be excluded. I suspect that if you had explained to the girls that it was a special treat for the birthday girl and although they can't come they can have a treat while they wait (I'm thinking an ice cream or something) then I think they may have handled it better. \n\nThe other mom sounds like she came on way too aggressive, and all things considered I would she she's TA for being so intense about it.", "NTA\n\nKids have to learn that things aren't always equal. It was your daughter's birthday, were the friends supposed to get birthday presents and have happy birthday sung to them too? \nHindsight is 20/20 and yes you could have mentioned you had the other girls with you, but shit happens. 20 minutes isn't very long, and they had each other to entertain themselves with. \n\nTell the mom if she wants to be so entitled then she can pay you back for the ticket, and gas money, since if everyone gets everything equally, that means she shares equal responsibility for the cost.", "NTA.\n\nI'd say it was an oversight, you said yourself that you didn't think that it could come out as unfair until in the car when the daughter was talking about it.\n\nYou realized it might be unfair, we all make mistakes. It happens.\n\nAlthough it Was your girls birthday so I'd say that was a bonus for her. Same as if she had gotten presents and they don't because it's her birthday.\n\nSure it sucks for them to sit and wait, I bet then again, I'm sure they had alot to talk about after the whole show anyway...\n\nAn honest mistake and oversight doesn't make someone and AH and you can't change what was.\n\n\nAlso, it wasn't planned. You didn't plan to take her backstage, it wasn't an activity for the event.", "Nta, mom shows where the kid gets the entitled attitude from. Let them know that you won't be taking anyone's kids anywhere going forward since it's such a problem. Also, husband just sounds like he \"wants to avoid drama\" because I don't see how in the world your reaction to a totally inappropriate phone call could be seen as \"instigating\" anything. The other mom literally instigated it with the phone call and aggression.  Could you have taken daughter aside, sure, but you're far from an asshole imo", "NTA life\u2019s not fair kids! Yeah you could have done it differently but you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Your daughter got to meet an old friend of yours. It\u2019s her birthday. I\u2019m sure 6 year olds at birthday parties are also disappointed they don\u2019t get to keep a present they liked. They got to see an amazing show, you did plenty for them. Also- wouldn\u2019t you need to check with parents before taking their 6 year olds to an unplanned backstage meet and greet? If you did take them I bet there would be some other complaint. You got your daughter a tshirt and not mine? You definitely aren\u2019t an AH, kids are sensitive but at a certain age you learn you aren\u2019t entitled to something just because your friend has it.", "NTA. Your daughter shouldn't miss out on that opportunity. \n\nMaybe next time, just tell her not to talk about it until she gets home.", "NTA these kids got a dose of reality. Sometimes you dont get what you want. Gotta learn to deal with disapointment at some point. \nAlso.. Even discounted tickets are still pretty pricey. That mother shouldve just shut her mouth and been grateful that her child got to experience it at all. There I said it.", "YTA. What\u2019s wrong with just telling your friend you were a party of 6? He could have made the decision for you.", "NTA. I hate ungrateful people. You took kids to an expensive show, a long drive away, parents need to teach them to appreciate what they get.", "NTA.  That other mom is entitled.", "NTA. You treated those kids to a show. A little disappointment won\u2019t hurt them.", "\u201cOne of the experiences\u201d for a birthday girl or boy is gifts. Should you have also bought them a bunch of gifts on your daughters birthday or is it just the backstage they wanted? It\u2019s pigheaded of those parents to EXPECT everyone to reap the benefits of what was years of hard work for you. That\u2019s called coat tail riding. You\u2019re NTA they\u2019re just jealous and petty", "NTA. \n\nI work in a theater and I can\u2019t bring anyone backstage with me. Hell, even front of house staff aren\u2019t supposed to be back of house depending on the tour.", "Nta. Boohoo the birthday girl got a special experience and the other kids had to wait WITH EACH OTHER for a few minutes after being treated to a show. The entitlement in these new kids these days is crazy. It\u2019s normal for the birthday person to get special treatment. I could see if she only had one friend with her that was left by herself with dad, but jeez you all were only gone for 20min and they had each other. Parents need to teach their kids coping skills because this \u201ceverybody is a winner\u201d mentality that is being instilled is getting out of hand. It is not the end of the world if another kid gets a special treat on their freaking birthday and you don\u2019t.", "YTA. A good host doesn't single out certain guests for special treatment.\n\nYour original text should have been clear you had a gaggle of girls.  At that point it was up to your friend to agree to then see you all or say it wasn't convenient.", "Host etiquette 101, especially for a group of little girls. Why couldn\u2019t you tell your friend there weee 2 other girls waiting? It was your idea to take the girls out. You are the host. And at the very end you excluded them. Worse than that, you didn\u2019t even bother asking your daughter to refrain from talking about it. YTA", "NTA. You already brought girls to the show (driving and tickets). They had fun after show and were supervised by your husband. That\u2019s an amazing experience! \nYou had a chance to talk to an old friend, and your daughter got an opportunity to see backstage. Should you have risked that opportunity by saying \u201cwe are group of 6\u201d? No. Such chance might never appear again, and it is great that your daughter saw something new and could share it with her friends. \n\nThe only thing you could have done better is an open communication with other little girls. \u201cSorry, girls, I could only take my daughter in, would it be ok if she tells you what she saw in there?\u201d \nI bet after such introduction girls would be more feeling curious rather than left out.", "NTA. It's a birthday party. Obviously the birthday girl is going to get special treatment. Should OP have bought gifts for the other kids too?", "NTA\nIt wasn\u2019t that girl\u2019s birthday, she was a guest like every other child you took with you and your family to this event. \n\nWould it have been nice if all kids were included? Sure, but again\u2026 this performer is your friend, and you surprised your daughter for her birthday. No one else is entitled to extras on an already exciting event when the event is tailored to one individual already. \n\nI understand the other mom was upset her kid was upset but that\u2019s a teachable moment that you can\u2019t expect to be treated as special as the honored person at a party just because you\u2019re there. You already had done something to include their kid by arranging this, you didn\u2019t owe any other child anything for your kid\u2019s birthday.

Then I\u2019d say YTA, but that\u2019s not the case here.", "NTA\n\nI used to work in the music business. It's fine to invite a person or two backstage, but not a group. You took these children to see a show, not their parents. If parents can't teach their children to be grateful when someone does something nice for them and that they can't always get what they want, they aren't parenting correctly.

You didn't mention that it was your fault. Those are kids obviously they are going to feel left out and they are gonna cry.

They should be thankful and happy to go to such an event and understand that your kid was the birthday girl and sometimes the special person of the day gets things others don\u2019t get. Yes they are young but if my not yet 3 year old understands someone else\u2019s birthday means they get gifts and he doesn\u2019t then 6 yr olds surely can get the same concept.", "YTA.\n\nWhy didn't you just respond to your friend and tell him you had other people with you? You probably didn't have to exclude anyone.", "Yeah, YTA. I'm sure your daughter loved the experience which is great but you really should've considered the entire party's feelings. I doubt you left out the group when buying popcorn and drinks, similar consideration should've been given.", "The fact that the other mom overreacted doesn't excuse your poor form here. if you didn't think you could take all three, you should have politely declined.  YTA.", "YTA. It would have been so easy to avoid this and yet you made no attempt to include the others. \n\nIf I were hubby I would be concerned that you orchestrated that intentionally  so he would be forced to stay in lobby to watch the girls and not meet your old gymnast friend\u2026", "YTA you didnt even TRY.  I mean it was bad enough that the other parent reached out to you, and then yuou just argued with her and insulted her child.  Good luck next year when your daughters bday rolls around.  Parents who do these things just never consider the social repercussions it has on the child...", "Yta- your daughter isn\u2019t going to have friends in school for a while\u2026 good job mom", "YTA. Not only are you an AH for excluding the other girls, but not once did you stop to think about how this might effect your daughters friendships with these girls.", "Hmmm this is a difficult one. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA for this. I can see how you ended up in an awkward position of not wanting to impose all the kids but not wanting your daughter to miss out on that opportunity for her birthday. I also find it kind of hard to believe all of them were that upset about this? I feel like my kids would have barely noticed if they were having fun and wouldn\u2019t have gone home crying but maybe that specific kid is particularly sensitive/easily hurt/doesn\u2019t like to be excluded from anything. \n\nThat mom is TA for pressing the issue after you already explained yourself and after her daughter had a wonderful night! This would have been an excellent chance to explain to her child that we can\u2019t always get what everyone else gets, especially on someone else\u2019s birthday. \n\nYeah, NTA.", "Boy that's gonna make her circus school awkward when none of her friends want to talk to her and it spreads among the other kids what happened.\n\nYou handled this so wrong in so many ways, and you don't even give a shit. Good job probably tanking your daughters friendships, all because you didn't want to speak up and say you weren't there alone.\n\nYTA. Absolutely.", "YTA. When your daughter doesn't receive invitations to events from other children, you will know why.", "yea how would you feel if your kid came home from a bday party crying because they were excluded? Yta", "The child is 6 and felt left out so I get that she couldn't contain her emotions about it when she got home. They wouldn't have the mature understanding of why only one person (your daughter) and you get to go while they wait.   \n\n\nDo I agree with the friend's mother lashing out, no. Definitely better ways to go about it. However I also think that there was a better way for you to handle not making the other party members feel left out either. I think you should have at least tried to ask. And if your friend said no, then that would have solved the issue of having a limited amount of people backstage.", "This whole thing is fake AF.", "YTA. How is it possible that you don\u2019t see that?", "Yta \n\nIt was very rude to exclude your daughter's friends and husband from going backstage to see the behind the scenes stuff.\n\nI also didn't know circus schools were even a thing. I think that's pretty cool that you taught me something new.", "Ah here. \n\nYTA, for the simple reason you took the decision to just bring your daughter and not mention the other people in your party. \n\nOnce again I am baffled someone could write this out and not get that they are in the wrong.", "On top of the obvious, you left 3, 6 year olds in the care of your husband at a large crowded venue YTA", "The sad thing is that, because of your short sightedness, you have probably made your daughters life miserable in the future.  The mom you went off on - your daughter probably will not get invited to bday parties, movies, and sleepovers.  These girls will talk.  She probably will get left out.  And when she comes home crying because she wasn't invited to a bday party, you need to look in the mirror.  You are a major ***hole", "YTA. why would you take kids to a place where they can\u2019t ALL experience things? surely you wouldn\u2019t have liked if the roles were reversed and someone invited your daughter along with them only for them to give their daughter *only* special treatment? be a better parent and have an open mind. if you wouldn\u2019t want something for your daughter have the common sense to atleast *think* about if other kids would like it to. you don\u2019t need to be chaperoning any events moving forward because you\u2019re inconsiderate and blow up on people that call you out when you\u2019re wrong.", "NTA, if you felt that it was too much to ask to bring all of them, it might have been. It would be massive bonus points if you where able to bring all the girls tho.", "YTA, breaking these little babies' hearts. They don't understand the semantics of who/how you were going backstage. They just know they were left behind. I think you secretly wanted this to be just you and your daughter.", "YTA.", "YTA.  \"That's so generous of you!  I didn't mention, but we also brought a couple of my daughter's friends from her circus school.  Would it be possible for all of us to come back?  I don't want to impose but I wouldn't feel right leaving the 3 other girls behind.\"  \n\nThat is a completely reasonable way to respond.  It's not imposing at all.  It was horribly rude of you not to ask about the other girls as well.", "YTA, extremely rude. You were hosting those children by taking them to an event and then dipped for at least 20 minutes. Basic etiquette\n\nEdit to add: maybe YOU should talk to YOUR daughter and teach her not to boast constantly in front of other kids about how she got to do something at an event she invited them to and they didn't.\n\nDon't catch an attitude if your kid is not invited to things.", "YTA. You had so many options to avoid hurt feelings, and instead, you didn't do any of them and just let a bunch of 6 year olds get their feelings hurt.\n\nYou could've notified your friend that you had 4 kids with you, and asked if that was too many kids to go backstage. \n\nIf the answer was yes, too many kids, you could've either a) not taken any kids backstage or b) quietly taken your daughter backstage as a birthday girl gift, but then instructed her that if she accepted this gift, she wasn't allowed to tell her friends about it, since it might hurt their feelings. This would be an opportunity to teach your kid about behaving appropriately when she gets things that others don't.\n\nInstead, you refused to ask if the other girls could come back stage, and also let your daughter behave boorishly, letting her rub this opportunity in her friends' faces.\n\nYou owe these parents and kids an apology, unless you want your daughter to suffer the social consequences. I mean, if you're cool with her being excluded from other social outings with these girls, that's on you, I guess.", "YTA: I bet you\u2019ll be just as accepting she her friends start excluding her /s", "YTA", "In my opinion: YTA \n\nYou knew what you were doing, you should have either told your friend the scenario and asked or told it to him and declined. He only invited the two of you because he only knew of the two of you and you didn\u2019t want the offer rescinded. Also, you and your husband need to start teach your daughter how to read the room. It was not nice at all that she kept showing off, by talking incessantly about the experience she had, to people who were there, but were left out.", "YTA  \nYTA  \nYTA", "I think it\u2019s wild that your daughter didn\u2019t feel weird about it. I\u2019m really imagining myself in first grade, and thinking about how being separated from class for \u201cgifted\u201d class was so freaking embarrassing, even though it was an exciting thing that other kids wanted to do really badly. Coming back into class and seeing the other kids being envious was the absolute worst part of my day. It felt so unfair because they deserved to get to have a fun break in the day, too. \n\nOr like, when I got a toy that I knew my neighbor wanted, I\u2019d specifically hide it when she came over. Not because she\u2019d want it or anything, but again\u2026it just felt unfair to be showing off that I got the thing she wanted. \n\nSo anyway, YTA for a lot of things here, not the least of which is that you didn\u2019t warn your kid to keep her excitement to herself. Of course bragging about the extra special thing she got to do was going to make the other kids sad. It\u2019s bizarre that it never occurred to you as a possibility. You aren\u2019t preparing your daughter for real social situations, and that\u2019s on you. 6 is not too young to start learning compassion humility. It\u2019s a little late really - those social things are a big part of what we\u2019re supposed to be learning in our formative years.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if those kids don\u2019t want to do special days with your kid anymore.", "What\u2019s sad is that\u2014 children being children, will probably make your daughter\u2019s life a little hard. Her friends will not let her live this down and she will be considered a possible *you*, one who night make selfish decisions and not think of others, and they might start excluding her from stuff on purpose. Or just treat her differently cause it really puts you off to see a friend of yours get special treatment while you\u2019re made to wait like a less important person. Ugh. What a bitch~ is probably the feeling they\u2019re getting from this. \n\nYou should apologize for your DAUGHTER\u2019S sake. IF you want her to keep those friends\u2026", "NTA", "No, my opinion.", "ESH. It *was* rude to leave your daughter's guests just waiting while she had her backstage visit \u2013 while it was a spur of the moment choice, you were able to be considerate enough of not wanting to 'impose' on *your* friend.\n\nHowever, the other mother needs to get a grip. It's not clear whether you apologised when she called, which is sometimes what people need to hear, but that likely wouldn't make the little girl feel better anyway.", "Definitely could've passed due to you being in a group. Slight YTA.", "YTA, specifically for not asking. I get that your intentions weren't necessarily bad but you could've at least asked and if he said no to the whole party, then you could've talked to the girls about it and see what all of them said.

YTA", "YTA. You didn't even tell your friend that you had other people with you who would be waiting up. Maybe the friend would have invited them, maybe not, but you didn't even try. You also absolutely should have thought to pre-emptively tell your daughter not to brag about an experience she got to have that her friends didn't, and stopped her if it happened anyways.", "You just as easily could have said I\u2019m here with my daughter, we have a few friends for her bd and my husband.

It would have been better to tell your daughter not to say anything and that was the only moment I think YTA. The other mom is also TA bc sometimes this is a learning moment for her kid.

You're child was super excited and I understand why the other children felt left out, BUT this is life. All children need to learn to be grateful for the unexpected gifts and not feel entitled to the extra perks just because others have access. The other mother was rude to call and make you feel bad after you offered her child an amazing event. It's not like you left the kids on their own. Your husband was with them. Your child should have been shushed in the car and distracted with other things to keep her from going on and on.", "YTA and you know it.", "Yikes, you excluded CHILDREN?!

Wow, do better!", "YTA bruh, in what way are you not in asshole when everyone involved is 6 years old? They don\u2019t understand nuance yet and it just seems like you excluded them without trying. \n\nEven adults would feel kind of shitty if they weren\u2019t allowed backstage if you didn\u2019t even try", "This is pretty basic stuff. Your daughter is 6, so you can't pretend to be completely oblivious to how 6 year olds are. Of course the other girls were going to feel left out and excluded, and you don't get to tell at another mother about how they should explain he ways of the world to their 6 YEAR OLD. These aren't teenagers. They are small children. These mothers sent their kids with you for a fun night, so of course they are upset when their kids come home crying about how they were excluded from the most exciting event of the evening. You didn't even have a discussion with your daughter about how it's rude to brag about the experience in front of her friends which didn't help, but IMO this shouldn't have happened at all. You had her 2 friends for the evening and I don't think you should have given your daughter an experience that her two friends had to sit out. They're 6. Of course they weren't going to understand.\n\nI think you should have politely declined with your friend. \"Thank you so much for that offer! You're very kind. Unfortunately, I am also with my husband and two of my daughter's friends tonight, and I wouldn't want to impose with such a large group.

If there parents had been there, and your family had simply stayed later while the other girls went home with their own families, that's maybe a different situation!

It wasn't fair. Do better.", "YTA. I think you had a feeling that backstage couldn't accommodate a party of 6, so you deliberately left out the act that there were indeed 4 other people in  your party. How would you feel if roles were reversed and another mom did that to your daughter, and she came home crying? You'd just talk to her about how to deal with such frustrations? Something tells me that's not exactly how that would play out....", "YTA.

No, really, that was such an A-hole move, you should apologize to the girls left out and their parents.\n\nMy brother-in-law is a professional musician and for a good 5 years worked with a well-known Blues guitarist and his band. The first time we saw the band play, my BIL introduced us to the well-known leader. And there were six of us. My BIL's rating skyrocketed in the eyes of our three kids because we got a little special treatment. It didn't hurt that the lead singer was very hospitable, as was his wife and his young twin daughters who happened to be there as well. And it was maybe a 3-4 minute introduction and gab session before the show started.\n\nYou first say that your acrobat friend invited only you and your daughter then admit you made no mention of your husband and your daughter's friends. I would hope your friend would have been more than gracious with your daughter and her friends. But if the invite was limited maybe you could have met your friend backstage and asked him to come out and meet the rest of your party. As others have said, don't be surprised if your daughter doesn't get invites or special treatment. That will be on you.  \n\n\nEdit to offer what OP could have done differently.", "ESH\n\nYou could have easily taken the whole group backstage.

You should have informed them how many you were with and waited to either get the green light to go in with everyone or politely decline the invite. Instead you omitted this information to guarantee that only your own kid would be given the chance to have a super special extra fun experience, to the detriment of her friends. I suspect that you know you were the A, given the way you keep hiding behind the guise of politeness. It isn't impolite to \"impose\" on your old friend by explaining your situation, but it is rude as all hell to leave your three GUESTS waiting in the parking lot while you take only your daughter to do something fun. I cannot imagine an adult thinking that is a fine thing to do.", "YTA", "YTA. You didn\u2019t even mention the other kids which seems very deliberate to me.

They're 6 and they got left out, of course the other girl was upset. Especially as they had to wait around for twenty minutes doing nothing, with your husband (and what was he supposed to do if one of the girls needed the bathroom?!). It was a nice idea to want to say hi to your performer friend, but thoughtless of you to not mention the other kids and not treat the party as a single unit. Your husband is right, you shouldn't have split the party.\n\nThat said, this wasn't a planned exclusion, as it wasn't a planned part of the outing, and the other mom is definitely an asshole for berating you like you're a kid and not listening to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She loves it so much that she asked to see a Cirque du Soleil show as a birthday present. My husband (37M) and I managed to get discount tickets to take her and three of her friends from circus school on a 2-hour drive to catch the nearest show.\n\nWhen I got there I checked the company credits and noticed a friend of mine, an acrobat from Belgium, was one of the performers. I hadn\u2019t see him in years and sent him a message on Instagram just to say I was in the audience with my daughter and excited to see him. He replied almost immediately and told me to look for a stage manager after the show so we could say hi and I could take my daughter backstage. And so I did - since he only invited me and my daughter (I didn\u2019t mention in my short message there were three other girls + my husband, and I couldn\u2019t impose taking a small party backstage), my husband waited with the girls for about 20 min after the show was over while we toured backstage.\n\nMy daughter was so happy! Yet she kept talking about it on the way home and that\u2019s when I realized the other girls could be feeling left out. What do you know? The same night one of the girls\u2019 mother called me, to say her daughter came home crying because she didn\u2019t get to go backstage and that it was very poor form on my part to invite them to a party and to exclude them from one of the experiences. I tried to explain how things played out, but she kept being aggressive - until I finally lost it and told her she had no right to call me and try to reprimand me and should instead have a talk to her daughter about how to deal with such frustrations. My husband says I should not have instigated and that, in hindsight, I shouldn\u2019t have split the party. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But teaching them to bitch they're friends out because they didn't get to do it to us stupid and honestly horrible parenting because guess what life isn't dair.

You invited them to a super exciting event and then excluded them so only your daughter had the backstage meet and greet that only she was apart of. Of course the other girls would be sad and if I was their mom I would be very upset. They wouldn\u2019t have cared if you had 2 other little girls and you didn\u2019t even bother to ask.

It was your daughters and the only AO I'd the parent that called you in regards to her spoiled daughter.", "NAH\n\nYou were incredibly generous to take all the girls in the first place. They are all small, they will chatter about what excites them. You could have asked your friend to bring everyone, but you also in no way needed to have him feel forced by mentioning it. Also, you were polite on the phone with the mom, but everyone has a breaking point, but really, what did she expect you to do after the fact?\n\nThe other little girls are just that, little kids who are going to be upset they missed out, but that is life and everyone doesn\u2019t get to do everything.

I would have a huge bouncy house party and not invite your daughter.", "Going to go against the grain here and say NTA. The only thing I can see that you could have done differently would be to ask your husband to take the other girls home while you two went backstage. It\u2019s your friend who was performing, and you know them best and whether you could have imposed to bring a whole group of kids backstage.

I can understand getting caught up in the moment and not thinking about how it would make the other girls feel, but at the same time you obviously should have asked your friend if the whole party could come back.

You didn't owe those kids anything - they already got the opportunity to see a stunning show, and their parents didn't have to lift a finger for them to get it. \n\nIt would've been exciting but I imagine large parties on the backstage are not a good idea. Your daughter was the birthday girl, and even in a traditional setting that meant she'd get experiences other guests would not, like another comment pointed out. \n\nIf the mother of the other kid had been reasonable an apology would've been appropriate, but being aggressive from the get go because her precious child didn't get an even more exciting experience is just uncalled for. \n\nI'd honestly stop volunteering to include other children.
