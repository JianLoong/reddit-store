My brothers (14 and 18m) have began sharing a bathroom with me when my oldest sister moved out and my brothers and 21f switched rooms which means my brothers now share a bathroom with me. I have expressed protest in this because my brothers are just too messy and refuse to clean up after themselves. The bathroom became messy quite easily and I have asked them several times if they could at least try to keep the bathroom clean. My mom would start yelling at me, calling me messy and how a grown woman shouldn\u2019t live in filth. I kept defending myself dozens of times and I have even shown her the clean bathroom the second I was done cleaning, only for it to be destroyed in less than an hour by my brothers. \n\nGuests are coming over today and I cleaned the bathroom the night before. When I woke up this morning, the bathroom was quickly messy again. My mom saw and immediately starts berating me and told me to clean up. I refused and said that my brothers need to help since the bathrooms was never messy before they started using it. My mom denied it and again said that I am a grown woman and I shouldn\u2019t be filthy. 21f heard us talking and she joined in and said I shouldn\u2019t clean as it\u2019s unfair.

Is she okay? She sounds very annoying.\n\nHonestly, I'd just use a different bathroom. Even if it's a bit further, go back to sharing with 21f. Refuse to use the brother-share room at all. Don't enter it. Don't go in there.\n\nThen tell your mother you aren't a maid.\n\nI get the feeling she was the one who cleaned the other bathroom and is just sick of doing it, so can now scapegoat you instead. That's lazy and she knows what's up, she's just being like this so somebody else can clean up after her ill-trained little chimpanzees.\n\nAlso, you're not a grown woman, you're 16, and one of your brothers is older than you. \n\nShe's training awful boys to be terrible men.", "NTA. Why should you clean when your brothers don't have to. Are they grounded for making the mess? If not, refuse the grounding.", "NTA. a grown woman shouldn\u2019t live in filth but two grown men can? what a joke.", "NTA --- Ask your sister if you can share/use her bathroom and the next time your mother says it needs cleaning, tell her you don't use that bathroom you asked to share with your sister and that the only ones to use that bathroom is now your brothers, therefore, it's their mess to clean not yours.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is perfectly okay with living in denial over the fact that her boys can make a mess just because they are boys. Nobody should live in filth. And if you and your brothers share a bathroom, it is equally their responsibility as it is yours.\n\nYour mom is actively trying to bring up the point of GROWN woman and trying to force you to clean up after other people's messes while actively trying to NOT hold your GROWN brothers accountable.\n\nIf this happens in other instances too, where she favors her sons over you, I am sorry.\n\nAbsolutely NTA for refusing to clean up, and tbh, you shouldn't have cleaned up after them after they made a mess earlier too. Mom is an AH for grounding you and refusing to believe you.", "NTA.\n\nI agree with what others have said - go back to sharing a bathroom with your sister, and refuse to enter your brothers' bathroom. Refuse to accept being \"grounded\" when the offence for which you are grounded is that you won't clean up your brothers' filth, they should do it.  \n\n\n\"My mom would start yelling at me, calling me messy and how a grown woman shouldn\u2019t live in filth.\"  \n\n\nNext time she says this, tell her she's absolutely right, that's why you're sharing a bathroom with your 21-year-old sister, and refusing to live in the filth your brothers make.", "Nta. Your mother is going to soon ask why her daughter's  doesn't want to talk to her or visit her at all.", "NTA\n\nYour mother is right-- you ARE a grown woman! and as such, you've chosen NOT to live in filth & NOT be treated as the bathroom janitor. Your brothers need to learn to clean up after themselves--it's called 'a life skill'! They will eventually (HOPEFULLY!) move out & live on their own---who's going to clean their bathroom then?", "NTA. But also info: is there a culture issue at play here? Or pure USA misogyny?", "You are NTA in this situation. Your brothers are unsanitary and need to help you clean. I have this same issue with my brother, and my mother doesnt make him do anything, but she cleans the bathroom after him. Either your brothers need to start cleaning or your mother needs to clean the bathroom herself.", "NTA\n\nBut your mother sure is. Get your older sister to come with you and demand that a cleaning schedule be set up. You and the brothers are on a 3-way rotating schedule that is printed out and posted. The bathroom has to be completely cleaned by the assigned person on their day. (I'd go in and take pictures after they clean on \"their days\" so if they do a crap job, you do just as a crap of a job and show your mom the pics.) There is zero reason why you should be cinderella for these nasty man-trolls.", "NTA.", "Your Mum is gaslighting you because she doesn\u2019t want to discipline your brothers. She\u2019s a mess. NTA", "Yeah she loves the boys over you sorry to break that you but my mother was like that she loved and spoilt my sister to the point where she refused to do anything when she did anything wrong and I was beaten by her when my sister did something and I didn't sort that out and used to belittle me with her. Put your foot down and tell your mother that she's the reason her son will be a unless and irresponsible prick cause she's not making him realise his mistake PS I did do this if nothing else she'll get off your back", "Nope not even close NTA. Your mom is the TA and the biggest of all. Your brothers are but I see it's because she allows them to be this way. This would be a hill I would be willing to die on. Your brothers should be made to clean up after themselves. You and your sister aren't their maids.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
