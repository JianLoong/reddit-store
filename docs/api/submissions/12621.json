I have expressed protest in this because my brothers are just too messy and refuse to clean up after themselves. The bathroom became messy quite easily and I have asked them several times if they could at least try to keep the bathroom clean. My mom would start yelling at me, calling me messy and how a grown woman shouldn\u2019t live in filth.

When I woke up this morning, the bathroom was quickly messy again. My mom saw and immediately starts berating me and told me to clean up. I refused and said that my brothers need to help since the bathrooms was never messy before they started using it. My mom denied it and again said that I am a grown woman and I shouldn\u2019t be filthy. 21f heard us talking and she joined in and said I shouldn\u2019t clean as it\u2019s unfair. My mom then went off on both of us and said it isn\u2019t fair for her to clean the bathroom, not acknowledging or punishing my brothers for not helping to clean the bathroom clean. \n\nI am now grounded for the rest of the weekend and had to turn in my car keys. My mom has been rolling her eyes and side eyeing me throughout the day. \n\nAre we the assholes for refusing to clean?\n\n\nEdit: the bathroom isn\u2019t the only place my brothers make a mess in. They also mess up the living rooms as well. I have asked my sister if she was ok with me sharing a bathroom with her and she said it\u2019s fine. I will not use the bathroom downstairs for a while just to see if my mom will still blame me for leaving a mess.\n\nEdit 2: my dad is in the picture. He is out of the house a lot for work and he has spoken to my brothers about doing their part in making the bathroom clean but it fell on deaf ears.
