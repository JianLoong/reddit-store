YTA a million times over. _\"given the circumstances she should have understood\"_ what does that even mean? It's not like you're working in a crucial job like being a paramedic or a surgeon where you get suddenly called. There was no REAL reason you shouldn't be at the wedding - you weren't having any crisis yourself either. I get that you love Taylor Swift and it's cool you won the tickets but that's your MOM getting married, not a friend or distant relative. You seem to be making this about her fiance who you don't like. Maybe you have your reasons for not liking him and that's perfectly fine. But unless you have a broken relationship with your mum, just do the right thing, smile for a few hours, and be there for her. It's her wedding too.\n\nYou need to understand your mum is going to be married to this dude now. The wedding is just the start of a series of events that you're going to be expected at, being her daughter. You have the chance to decline them in the future. But man, your mum's wedding is VERY MUCH a once in a life time event - unlike any concert. This is such a ridiculous question. If I was your mum I would want you there and would feel offended and hurt that you chose a concert over my wedding. As someone else commented even Taylor Swift herself would want you to attend your mum's wedding. \n\nINFO What is your actual objection to the fiance? _The only situation I would say you are JUSTIFIED in missing the wedding, is if he is emotionally/physically abusive to you and hurts you or your mum. And if your mum enables him rather than understanding you, and if they are forcing you into things including coming to the wedding. Also if your mum has been brainwashed by him and hurts you too/gives him privileges you don't get._\n\nBut if this is more of a situation where you're skeptical of your mum having a relationship outside of hers with your late father, then maybe you should just give this guy the respect he deserves as a human. He is not here to replace your father, but it's clear your MOTHER loves him. YOU don't have to. But if you can't understand that this guy makes your mother happy then I don't know what to tell you. Please consider this a small sacrifice you have to make for your mum who I assume you have a good relationship with otherwise. I think this is all happening very quickly for you and you need to understand your mum is not replacing your dad. She has lost her partner and needs someone to support her where she's lacking. Go and be there for her too.", "It almost sounds like Freaky Friday with Lindsey Lohan? You don't say how old you are.

You say you love her but can\u2019t be there for her on that special day of hers? And you\u2019re using Talor Swift tickets as the excuse? Wow.

What I'm saying is that it's impossible to buy a product that simply isn't there. Just because you sold something doesn't mean you can get it back. Taylor swift concerts are 100% attendance and have been for most of her tours, hell, last night she broke a record for high attendance.

She doesn\u2019t like your partner so even though she said she\u2019d be at your wedding, she bails for a concert.

They aren't putting tracking onto them like its stolen bank loot", "I\u2019ve won concert tickets from the radio. Never had to sign shit. Never had to read the contest rules.

They literally don\u2019t care what you do with the tickets after you pick them up. There is no clause in the pick up form you sign that says you can\u2019t sell them. They are concert tickets not a lottery house.", "Go away if you\u2019re not going to accept the judgement here. Annoying shit", "Exactly. Of course someone is within their right not to attend a wedding. But then you have to accept that your actions have consequences.

He\u2019s not abusive, he\u2019s not a gold digger, he\u2019s not some racist asshole. He\u2019s strict. So what? \n\nAnd tbh none of that even matters because OP told her mother she would be there *regardless of how she felt about him* and is now backing out of that commitment because she won tickets.\n\nSo the to be step father **by OP\u2019s own admission** is a none issue in regards to her own attendance at the wedding.

Others breaking different rules doesn\u2019t give you the right to break rules you agreed to.\n\nBut I agree that missing the wedding for a concert isn\u2019t right. If you\u2019re so against the wedding you\u2019d rather go to a concert, you shouldn\u2019t have agreed to go to the wedding at all.

Resale is prohibited if you're trying to make money off of it. And people still try to resell for 2000-5000$. They are assholes.

Anytime a big detail like that is \u201cforgotten\u201d it\u2019s usually added because OP isn\u2019t getting the response they want so they add a \u201cforgotten detail\u201d. \n\nBased off OP\u2019s post her and her mother had a conversation about her attendance at the wedding and OP reassured her mother she would be there to support her regardless of her feelings about him. OP had plenty of opportunity to be honest to her mom about not going and yet she doubled down on attending. \n\nIt\u2019s that last part, the doubling down and reassuring her mother she would be there that makes her an AH."]}
