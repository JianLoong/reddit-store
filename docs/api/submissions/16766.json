YTA a million times over. _\"given the circumstances she should have understood\"_ what does that even mean? It's not like you're working in a crucial job like being a paramedic or a surgeon where you get suddenly called. There was no REAL reason you shouldn't be at the wedding - you weren't having any crisis yourself either. I get that you love Taylor Swift and it's cool you won the tickets but that's your MOM getting married, not a friend or distant relative. You seem to be making this about her fiance who you don't like. Maybe you have your reasons for not liking him and that's perfectly fine. But unless you have a broken relationship with your mum, just do the right thing, smile for a few hours, and be there for her. It's her wedding too.\n\nYou need to understand your mum is going to be married to this dude now. The wedding is just the start of a series of events that you're going to be expected at, being her daughter. You have the chance to decline them in the future. But man, your mum's wedding is VERY MUCH a once in a life time event - unlike any concert. This is such a ridiculous question. If I was your mum I would want you there and would feel offended and hurt that you chose a concert over my wedding. As someone else commented even Taylor Swift herself would want you to attend your mum's wedding. \n\nINFO What is your actual objection to the fiance? _The only situation I would say you are JUSTIFIED in missing the wedding, is if he is emotionally/physically abusive to you and hurts you or your mum. And if your mum enables him rather than understanding you, and if they are forcing you into things including coming to the wedding. Also if your mum has been brainwashed by him and hurts you too/gives him privileges you don't get._\n\nBut if this is more of a situation where you're skeptical of your mum having a relationship outside of hers with your late father, then maybe you should just give this guy the respect he deserves as a human. He is not here to replace your father, but it's clear your MOTHER loves him. YOU don't have to. But if you can't understand that this guy makes your mother happy then I don't know what to tell you. Please consider this a small sacrifice you have to make for your mum who I assume you have a good relationship with otherwise. I think this is all happening very quickly for you and you need to understand your mum is not replacing your dad. She has lost her partner and needs someone to support her where she's lacking. Go and be there for her too.", "It almost sounds like Freaky Friday with Lindsey Lohan? You don't say how old you are.
