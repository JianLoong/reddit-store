Can you do the ceremony then skip the reception and head to the concert. \n\nAlso for what it's worth I would probably skip my own wedding for eras tickets", "YTA and very selfish. TS is not once in a lifetime. But your mother finding happiness again (regardless of your like for the groom) is very rare.", "YTA. You HAD to have known those tickets you won were for the same date. Most, if not all, ticket giveaways I hear about on the radio tell you which date/time they are giving away. You signed up/called in for those tickets likely KNOWING it was the same date/time as your mother\u2019s wedding. I can\u2019t fault you for not wanting to go to the wedding since you don\u2019t approve of the marriage (although she shouldn\u2019t really need your approval, she should have been listening to your concerns and taking them into account). I can fault you for finding a way to avoid going AFTER you said you would be there, albeit informally. You made a commitment to your mother for that day.", "YTA, this is your mother.  What is it that you do not like about him.  Does he treat you mother poorly?  Is he a gold digger?  Has he told you that you will not be welcome in your mothers home once they marry?  Is your childhood home being sold?", "YTA lol \"thought she would understand due to the circumstances\" .... You're acting like this is some sort of last minute emergency that cannot be helped.  If/when you get married, and your mother doesn't like your spouse, would you be upset that she'd skip your wedding to go to Coachella instead?

There\u2019s no way I would show up to a wedding where my mom is marrying a dude that felt comfortable yelling at me. It kind of sounds like you were looking for an excuse to not go. Are you ok with not having a relationship with your mom for a while, possibly permanently? In some situations that\u2019s understandable. I think this post is really too vague. ESH but also life sucks, do things that make you happy. \n\nEdit to add: if you are financially dependent on your mom you need to add this into your sedici\u00f3n making.", "INFO: did you know the concert was the same day before you entered the contest?", "YTA, especially if you passed up the option of selling the tickets and putting the money towards tickets for a later concert", "OOF.  It's hard to say without knowing some context...  I'm getting YTA vibes.  IF you and your mom have a good relationship... IF you are close and she has been supportive and loving and there for you.  Then you are DEFINITELY the A-hole.  Why would ANYONE continue to support someone who doesn't support them?  Family or not.  That's just common sense.  \n\nNow... if you have a bad relationship with your mom, and she has actively chosen herself and other people over YOU in the past... then heck yeah, go be a Swiftie.  \n\nBut I am getting the feeling that you are being selfish.  Again, need more context about the relationship.", "Unless you're basically no contact with your mom, YTA. This is her wedding, and it doesn't sound like it's her fifth or sixth wedding.

How old are you? I hope your mum goes no contact. If she is upset you won\u2019t be there and you still go to see Taylor Swift you would a massive YTA. I understand that the groom isn\u2019t someone you like but if your mum doesn\u2019t feel she has you in her corner now will she feel like coming to you if she needs help? It is only a concert, is it worth more then your mum\u2019s happiness?", "I'm so confused by all these comments saying OP should go support their mom etc when they stated they don't  like the guy and how it's not about them all this stuff. When you have kids and you get remarried if you're kids still live with you why would you marry someone who treats them badly etc?

You dont like the guy or approve of the marriage, so why go and support it? Just go to the swift concert and expect a fallout.", "NTA. You do not like your mother  choice of husband nor  the idea of the wedding.  You have told your mum this .  If she listen to you, she would done counselling with  you or  therapy.    \nThe only thing is, now you can stand up in church and object.", "Dude this is giving me such narc vibes I'm sorry. YTA a million times over. _\"given the circumstances she should have understood\"_ what does that even mean? It's not like you're working in a crucial job like being a paramedic or a surgeon where you get suddenly called. There was no REAL reason you shouldn't be at the wedding - you weren't having any crisis yourself either. I get that you love Taylor Swift and it's cool you won the tickets but that's your MOM getting married, not a friend or distant relative. You seem to be making this about her fiance who you don't like. Maybe you have your reasons for not liking him and that's perfectly fine. But unless you have a broken relationship with your mum, just do the right thing, smile for a few hours, and be there for her. It's her wedding too.\n\nYou need to understand your mum is going to be married to this dude now. The wedding is just the start of a series of events that you're going to be expected at, being her daughter. You have the chance to decline them in the future. But man, your mum's wedding is VERY MUCH a once in a life time event - unlike any concert. This is such a ridiculous question. If I was your mum I would want you there and would feel offended and hurt that you chose a concert over my wedding. As someone else commented even Taylor Swift herself would want you to attend your mum's wedding. \n\nINFO What is your actual objection to the fiance? _The only situation I would say you are JUSTIFIED in missing the wedding, is if he is emotionally/physically abusive to you and hurts you or your mum. And if your mum enables him rather than understanding you, and if they are forcing you into things including coming to the wedding. Also if your mum has been brainwashed by him and hurts you too/gives him privileges you don't get._\n\nBut if this is more of a situation where you're skeptical of your mum having a relationship outside of hers with your late father, then maybe you should just give this guy the respect he deserves as a human. He is not here to replace your father, but it's clear your MOTHER loves him. YOU don't have to. But if you can't understand that this guy makes your mother happy then I don't know what to tell you. Please consider this a small sacrifice you have to make for your mum who I assume you have a good relationship with otherwise. I think this is all happening very quickly for you and you need to understand your mum is not replacing your dad. She has lost her partner and needs someone to support her where she's lacking. Go and be there for her too.", "It almost sounds like Freaky Friday with Lindsey Lohan? You don't say how old you are. But, I guarantee your mom is not just going to get over this one and forget it ever happened.\n\nNTA for winning the tickets. But, somehow this doesn't sound like the tickets are your only issue?", "YTA. Feels like your original post is purposefully vague. You\u2019re her daughter and you\u2019ve been planning on going for months, but you didn\u2019t RSVP so it\u2019s all good? How old are you? You say you love her but can\u2019t be there for her on that special day of hers? And you\u2019re using Talor Swift tickets as the excuse? Wow. Do you expect her to go to your wedding?", "This is incredibly selfish. \n\nYTA", "YTA. That's downright cruel towards your mother. You value some random pop star's concert higher than an event that is very important to her. Apparently you have made your priorities clear, so don't be surprised if your mother does the same.", "YTA It should be a no-brainer to pick mom over a concert.", "YTA.\n\nIf your mom is the kind of parent who deserves having Taylor Swift put above her, then she's not the kind of parent you would still speak to.", "NTA - tell your mom that you will come to the party if she buys you tickets for whenever Taylor is playing next, and if she cannot then say tough luck you can\u2019t join on her big day but you\u2019ll still be around to ask her help for when you\u2019re feeling low, in between jobs and need a place to stay, free babysitting should you plan to have kids", "NTA - If you've expressed that you're against the marriage and she's going through with it anyway, you're allowed to skip the wedding.
