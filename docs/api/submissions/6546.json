For as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve been the child my parents expect the most from yet give the least to. An example is I\u2019m an medical school, I went to the cheapest state school, and I\u2019m a paid intern at a cardiologists office. I have yet to hear my parents congratulate me or even say they\u2019re proud of me. My older sister went to the most expensive school for undergrad and the most expensive nursing school (in total her tuition costed about 500k). To add, they got her a gift when she applied to undergraduate schools, when she got in, when she graduated, when she got into nursing school, when she graduated, and when she passed her nclex. I have yet to receive anything even an affirmation statement. Thankfully I can say my family is comfortable financially but I do my best to avoid any additional costs for them hence the cheapest schools possible. \n\nOnto the issue, they expect me to watch after our dog and my sisters kid every waking moment of the day. I haven\u2019t had any time to myself because of this. I have plans? Nope can\u2019t have them gotta stay home and watch the dog so my parents can go out. Wanna watch a movie? Nope can\u2019t my sister needs me to go do her laundry. And if I say no it turns into an issue. There\u2019s so many examples of this but my cup overflowed when I was studying for the MCAT and they did not give me even enough respect to leave me alone to study. I was constantly watching after my dog, catering to them and their guests, and taking care of my then pregnant sister (as if she doesn\u2019t have a husband). I ended up having to retake.\n\nToday in the car my mom asked if I\u2019d move out if I get into an out of state school and I said \u201cin a heartbeat.\u201d She was visibly upset and asked why in a pretty angry manner. I mentioned all of the above reasons and then added \u201cif I stay here you guys will be the reason I fail academically.\u201d My whole family isn\u2019t talking to me now. AITA? \n\nI know I need privacy and a stress free study space for when I\u2019m studying to become a doctor but seeing how upset my mom got made me feel bad so I don\u2019t know.\n\nEdit to add: A few of you mentioned moving in with someone, I responded with how my grandparents have offered for me to move in with them but how that resulted (in the comments). Additionally, I pay for everything of mine the only thing I don\u2019t pay for is a roof over my head which I am thankful for. Someone mentioned confusion with my thankful portion of my parents being comfortable. Yes they are comfortable enough but that doesn\u2019t mean they cover my expenses. And whatever they have covered, I have eventually paid them back. Another thing to add is I\u2019ve mentioned in a comment, a while back they mentioned they would help with medical school tuition. But as I also said in that comment I don\u2019t know how likely that situation will be. I\u2019ll try to update if anything else occurs, I\u2019m hopeful me saying this to them today would maybe make them rethink how they\u2019ve been towards me.", "created_utc": 1672918293, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/103wry6/aita_for_telling_my_parents_i_cant_wait_to_move/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Even with it being a state school it's still super expensive. You shouldn't be doing your sister's laundry. \n\nWatching a dog really isn't that big a deal, just get up and feed it and let it out? Sometimes a quick break from studying is a good thing. But all the other requests are over the top. They need to leave you alone when you have to study.", "Nta", "NTA. They have shown you that your sister is the golden child. Leave ASAP.", "NTA. Your family is taking advantage of you wholesale. Think about going to grandparents or aunts/uncles until you can save up enough to get a place. Talk to a resource counselor at school to see what might be done to help, and maybe even go to Craigslist or something to look up places nearby that are looking for an extra roommate. There are a lot of houses that are rentals with tenants always looking for an extra roommate, especially in college towns. Costs such as rent and utilities are usually split equally, so the amount you'd be paying would be less than if you got yourself an apartment. Good luck.", "NTA. Get out of there ASAP. They are using you as a servant.", "NTA. Of course she's upset - she could lose ot on free help. What will they all do then? You absolutely must look after yourself here", "I pray you are accepted to an out of state school. I really do.", "# NTA.\n\nIt's understandable that you would want to move out if you feel like your parents expectations and demands are causing you stress and hindering your academic success.", "A tiny bit - as you could rephrase it differently, as you based on what you wrote knew the reaction it will cause. But they wholeheartedly deserved your response!  For the rest - MOVE OUT as fast as you can ! Get additional job if needed try to be as independent as possible. I had similar situation, and i moved out at 17. And I still loved and (kinda) respected my parents and they started to respect me much more after I moved out :D.  It was bit hard at the beggining but was best decision that I ever made:)", "Info: why are you still living with them?\n\nLeaning towards YTA. Because it sounds like you're an adult who could move out but doesn't and choose to blame everyone around you for the second and third order effects of that decision.", "This is complicated. You made your needs clear, and told your mom that you can\u2019t keep on like this. That\u2019s good - making your needs and boundaries clear, rather than making them subservient to everyone else\u2019s. That might be upsetting to some people, particularly people who are used to you putting them before yourself. \n\nWhere you might have crossed the line is in saying that your anticipated academic failure would be their fault. You need to take ownership over your choices, there. It\u2019s definitely possible that you won\u2019t be able to study the way you need to to pass if you\u2019re at your parents\u2019 house. But that doesn\u2019t make them the reason you fail. As long as the fairness of the grading isn\u2019t at issue - that\u2019s you. It\u2019s your failure to secure a situation that allows you to study that would be responsible for your failure. Not them. \n\nFor telling your parents you want to leave - NAH, and good for you, standing up for yourself. \n\nFor giving them the agency and responsibility to cause you to fail to study - YTA. That\u2019s your choices. I\u2019m glad you seem to be making different ones.", "YTA, though apparently with some provocation. In addition to privacy and a stress free space, you might want to consider acquiring some better people handling skills. You have been getting substantial support and benefit from your parents, even if it feels less than your sister got (and i assume you are correct, though that may be partly your perception), and i suspect you will continue to want some degree of support from them in the future. The satisfaction of saying what you did on the spur of the moment was short sighted. You dont address something as huge as that without thinking through the likely reaction and the outcome you desire. Are you getting what you want?", "NTA. It's important that you do well academically. And it really doesn't help when family dumps a whole bunch of stuff on you constantly. I mean, you do have to help your family when you're living in their house. But at the same time, you have your own work to do and they need to respect your time. \nIt can't all be down to your poor time management, imo. (Edit: just to be clear, not saying that you *do* have poor time management. Just that, that would be the typical response I imagine your family might give if you ever complained about not having time to study; \"well, you need to organise your time better\"). \n\nAdditionally, it - at the very least - *sounds* like an unfair distribution of effort. You doing all the chores etc. and not getting much appreciation.\n\nOut of curiosity are you a younger child, or older?\n\nI mean, I guess you could have been a little more tactful? But not really, all you did was answer the question honestly. And they need to know - it sounds like it's a problem so at the very least maybe it will prompt a discussion or some reevaluation.", "The way you have depicted your life is as if you seem to be in some sort of weird indentured situation as a younger sibling to the star older sibling. NTA but I would caveat that by saying you are fortunate your parents pay for your school. Want to be free? Get out from under their financial thumb (take out loans if you need to), else stop complaining about your free ride.", "I just feel really unappreciated. A simple \u201cI\u2019m proud of you\u201d is literally more than any monetary gift for me at this point.

Someone had mentioned to update and I\u2019m really hopeful that something good will come out of me finally saying this.", "The only main thing I\u2019m dependent on from them is a roof. I pay for everything of mine: car, insurances, and other extra stuff.", "The state school was for undergrad just to try to get the cheapest option available.

I scheduled a few meetings with counselors and financial advisors for next week.

I am too, but you've got it worse than I did.\n\nFwiw, I think you should be feeling good that at least it's out there and your mum is a bit more aware now.

But it had to be said.", "This is different info from your OP when you clearly say \"Thankfully I can say my family is comfortable financially but I do my best to avoid any additional costs for them hence the cheapest schools possible.\"\n\nSo you're saying you decided to go to a cheap college to not be a burden on your well-to-do family?

If I refuse it becomes a major issue involving major arguments, them threatening to cut me off, which I can\u2019t afford right now at all.

Hope this makes sense", "Honestly, if it was just my pupper that I needed to watch I wouldn\u2019t care at all. I wouldn\u2019t have even made the post. It\u2019s alllll the extra stuff (aka the sisters chores, the household chores, the constant catering). I love her and it\u2019ll kill me to have to move away from her but it\u2019s about time my parents and sister realize how difficult it is to watch after a dog that\u2019s pretty medically demanding.", "I got into two private schools and I opted to go to the state school so it would be less costly. I guess I should have mentioned this because they paid for my sisters entire schooling. When I decided on the cheaper school the only financial assistance I asked from them was paying for my books (which eventually I was able to find free pdf versions) and the insurance plan that the school provided (this was an automatic added expense onto the tuition which I wasn\u2019t able to get out of for two semesters) which I eventually got out of due to covid. The main reason I mentioned my gratefulness is because they had told me a while ago they would help me in paying for medical school but after today idk where that stands. Definitely not wanting attention just to know if I was wrong in saying that I\u2019d move out.", "I earnestly wish that you get in", "I've got everything crossed for you. I hope you get in and kick ass. You deserve better. \n\nNTA", "Even if you don\u2019t, you should consider moving out. How selfish of your family. They obviously don\u2019t care if you fail, so you should stop caring about their needs as well.", "I'm rooting for you!! NTA, of course!", "That\u2019s bordering financial abuse, and I rarely say that (this word gets thrown around way too often). At least you have some savings. Can you stay with a friend if the situation gets worse? Always good to have a back up plan\u2026", "Thank you so much!", "Turn deaf ear to everything and everything untill you get in your desired school. Getting in that school will be the best revenge.", "Thank you so much", "Even if it\u2019s a school close by, I\u2019d still move out.

I\u2019ve taken the offer many times but I just feel too much of a burden on them. I don\u2019t want them to have any negative energy or conflict around them.", "If your grandparents offered this in full knowledge of your situation (assuming they also agree your parents are taking advantage of you and mistreating you), perhaps you should consider it. They probably know what they\u2019d be getting into, but you can discuss that concern with them. You could help them around the house, which they probably need more than your parents. You could contribute financially too. It could be a win win.", "So this was the case the multiple times I moved in with them. I helped contribute in many ways especially physically and financially. What would usually happen during this time was I\u2019d move in with them, endless calls would start not only to me but also their home phone. But when I wouldn\u2019t respond they would show up and a huge argument/fight would occur. I absolutely love my grandparents and all they\u2019ve done and continue to do but they\u2019re at an age where I really don\u2019t want to put this energy and conflict around them. One of the times this my grandpa ended up having a panic attack during the argument and I rushed him to the emergency because he had exact symptoms of a heart attack. I just need to ride this out till I get in somewhere unless I can somehow someway move out sooner", "Oh wow sorry to hear! Sounds absolutely dreadful! How long till you can move out on your own and not give them (or anyone else who\u2019d tell on you) your address???", "I think by this upcoming July or august, I should be able to move out"]}
