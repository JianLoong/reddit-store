For as long as I can remember, I\u2019ve been the child my parents expect the most from yet give the least to. An example is I\u2019m an medical school, I went to the cheapest state school, and I\u2019m a paid intern at a cardiologists office. I have yet to hear my parents congratulate me or even say they\u2019re proud of me. My older sister went to the most expensive school for undergrad and the most expensive nursing school (in total her tuition costed about 500k). To add, they got her a gift when she applied to undergraduate schools, when she got in, when she graduated, when she got into nursing school, when she graduated, and when she passed her nclex. I have yet to receive anything even an affirmation statement. Thankfully I can say my family is comfortable financially but I do my best to avoid any additional costs for them hence the cheapest schools possible. \n\nOnto the issue, they expect me to watch after our dog and my sisters kid every waking moment of the day. I haven\u2019t had any time to myself because of this. I have plans? Nope can\u2019t have them gotta stay home and watch the dog so my parents can go out. Wanna watch a movie? Nope can\u2019t my sister needs me to go do her laundry. And if I say no it turns into an issue. There\u2019s so many examples of this but my cup overflowed when I was studying for the MCAT and they did not give me even enough respect to leave me alone to study. I was constantly watching after my dog, catering to them and their guests, and taking care of my then pregnant sister (as if she doesn\u2019t have a husband). I ended up having to retake.\n\nToday in the car my mom asked if I\u2019d move out if I get into an out of state school and I said \u201cin a heartbeat.\u201d She was visibly upset and asked why in a pretty angry manner. I mentioned all of the above reasons and then added \u201cif I stay here you guys will be the reason I fail academically.\u201d My whole family isn\u2019t talking to me now. AITA? \n\nI know I need privacy and a stress free study space for when I\u2019m studying to become a doctor but seeing how upset my mom got made me feel bad so I don\u2019t know.\n\nEdit to add: A few of you mentioned moving in with someone, I responded with how my grandparents have offered for me to move in with them but how that resulted (in the comments). Additionally, I pay for everything of mine the only thing I don\u2019t pay for is a roof over my head which I am thankful for. Someone mentioned confusion with my thankful portion of my parents being comfortable. Yes they are comfortable enough but that doesn\u2019t mean they cover my expenses. And whatever they have covered, I have eventually paid them back. Another thing to add is I\u2019ve mentioned in a comment, a while back they mentioned they would help with medical school tuition. But as I also said in that comment I don\u2019t know how likely that situation will be. I\u2019ll try to update if anything else occurs, I\u2019m hopeful me saying this to them today would maybe make them rethink how they\u2019ve been towards me.\n\nSlight update: my mom came into my room today and told me her and my dad want to set up a family meeting tonight with my sister. I told them only if my SO, uncle and aunt can be there too.

They have shown you that your sister is the golden child. Leave ASAP.", "NTA. Your family is taking advantage of you wholesale. Think about going to grandparents or aunts/uncles until you can save up enough to get a place. Talk to a resource counselor at school to see what might be done to help, and maybe even go to Craigslist or something to look up places nearby that are looking for an extra roommate. There are a lot of houses that are rentals with tenants always looking for an extra roommate, especially in college towns. Costs such as rent and utilities are usually split equally, so the amount you'd be paying would be less than if you got yourself an apartment. Good luck.", "NTA. Get out of there ASAP.

But they wholeheartedly deserved your response!  For the rest - MOVE OUT as fast as you can ! Get additional job if needed try to be as independent as possible. I had similar situation, and i moved out at 17. And I still loved and (kinda) respected my parents and they started to respect me much more after I moved out :D.  It was bit hard at the beggining but was best decision that I ever made:)", "Info: why are you still living with them?\n\nLeaning towards YTA.

You made your needs clear, and told your mom that you can\u2019t keep on like this. That\u2019s good - making your needs and boundaries clear, rather than making them subservient to everyone else\u2019s. That might be upsetting to some people, particularly people who are used to you putting them before yourself. \n\nWhere you might have crossed the line is in saying that your anticipated academic failure would be their fault. You need to take ownership over your choices, there. It\u2019s definitely possible that you won\u2019t be able to study the way you need to to pass if you\u2019re at your parents\u2019 house. But that doesn\u2019t make them the reason you fail. As long as the fairness of the grading isn\u2019t at issue - that\u2019s you.

Not them. \n\nFor telling your parents you want to leave - NAH, and good for you, standing up for yourself. \n\nFor giving them the agency and responsibility to cause you to fail to study - YTA.

You have been getting substantial support and benefit from your parents, even if it feels less than your sister got (and i assume you are correct, though that may be partly your perception), and i suspect you will continue to want some degree of support from them in the future. The satisfaction of saying what you did on the spur of the moment was short sighted. You dont address something as huge as that without thinking through the likely reaction and the outcome you desire. Are you getting what you want?", "NTA. It's important that you do well academically. And it really doesn't help when family dumps a whole bunch of stuff on you constantly. I mean, you do have to help your family when you're living in their house. But at the same time, you have your own work to do and they need to respect your time. \nIt can't all be down to your poor time management, imo. (Edit: just to be clear, not saying that you *do* have poor time management. Just that, that would be the typical response I imagine your family might give if you ever complained about not having time to study; \"well, you need to organise your time better\"). \n\nAdditionally, it - at the very least - *sounds* like an unfair distribution of effort. You doing all the chores etc. and not getting much appreciation.\n\nOut of curiosity are you a younger child, or older?\n\nI mean, I guess you could have been a little more tactful? But not really, all you did was answer the question honestly. And they need to know - it sounds like it's a problem so at the very least maybe it will prompt a discussion or some reevaluation.", "The way you have depicted your life is as if you seem to be in some sort of weird indentured situation as a younger sibling to the star older sibling.

I guess I should have mentioned this because they paid for my sisters entire schooling. When I decided on the cheaper school the only financial assistance I asked from them was paying for my books (which eventually I was able to find free pdf versions) and the insurance plan that the school provided (this was an automatic added expense onto the tuition which I wasn\u2019t able to get out of for two semesters) which I eventually got out of due to covid. The main reason I mentioned my gratefulness is because they had told me a while ago they would help me in paying for medical school but after today idk where that stands. Definitely not wanting attention just to know if I was wrong in saying that I\u2019d move out.", "I earnestly wish that you get in", "I've got everything crossed for you. I hope you get in and kick ass. You deserve better. \n\nNTA", "Even if you don\u2019t, you should consider moving out. How selfish of your family.

I absolutely love my grandparents and all they\u2019ve done and continue to do but they\u2019re at an age where I really don\u2019t want to put this energy and conflict around them.

Perhaps she can tell me i am wrong, but think when one does something like that, they should have some idea of what outcome they hope to achieve. Doctors are typically risk-averse personalities and a lot of emphasis in training is placed on assessing risks and benefits of actions. Maybe she will make a great doctor with no more help from her family, and can go NC with her parents and siblings while all the redditors applaud, but i am guessing she really did not think things through and may not reap much benefit.
