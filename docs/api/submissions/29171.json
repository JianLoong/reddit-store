I agreed to pay rent/utilities as well as pay for her classes and give her some spending money (300 dollars a month). \n\nI'm lucky in that I work at a good job, so I can eat breakfast, lunch and dinner for free at work. I've also worked on additional projects so that I can work more hours in order to support the both of us on my salary alone. For the last 6 months I've clocked in 60+ hours a week. \n\nWhen we were both working, we split chores 50/50. However, I find myself burning out during the week and unable to clean, and on the weekends she wants to spend Saturday on dates, with us cleaning on Sunday together.\n\nWe got into a bit of a row because I said that I'm dying and I need a day (Sunday) where I can just be alone or do something with my friends. She said she appreciates my help with her career change, but that since we both live in the apartment, we should both clean.\n\nI don't think it's fair since she's home much more than I am, and I make almost zero mess because I spend 60+ hours a week at work.

Based on the perks you\u2019ve described I\u2019m assuming you are paid on salary so you\u2019re not actually seeing additional $ for those extra hours (though it may play into bonuses etc). If you\u2019re telling yourself that staying at the office for a free dinner is saving you $, I would encourage you to rethink that strategy. Your gf is at home and needs to eat and the cost of an extra portion is negligible. You would likely be better off heading home and eating with her. I imagine that would go farther than cleaning the toilet. The hours you are working right now is a much bigger contributor to your feeling burnt out than your cleaning commitments. \n\nI say this from the perspective of someone who has been in your shoes and wishes I made different choices. When I was a young lawyer, I kept hours like that and it 100% lead to burnout. I can also tell you, that I was definitely NOT being productive during ALL of those insane hours I was working. It\u2019s one thing to pull a week like that in the midst of a big project but pulling hours like that every week will have significant negative consequences in every aspect of your life. It negatively affected my health, my relationships with my partner, my friends, and my family. I can also tell you that your workplace will not be there for you if your burnout leads you to you losing your job or needing to take significant time off. If you\u2019re lucky, your girlfriend will be. \n\nRemember, the way you are choosing to spend your hours is a function of what you value.", "I don't think either of you are the asshole but I also think you should take a step back and ask yourself if literally calling out 100% of the housework is going to make her feel.", "Since your GF studies, it is reasonable for you to spend a little bit of time tidying.  \n\nProbably not 50/50 anymore.

(Edit for clarity - I mean this in the sense that the money isn\u2019t being specifically designated for school expenses, not in a paternalistic sense.)\n- You took on an extra 20+ hours of work per week (which is really pushing into burnout territory) specifically to subsidize her lifestyle adjustment. Whereas, a full time student spends maybe 30 hours between class and studying/homework, so she theoretically has more free time now than she did before. \n- You eat your meals at the office 5 days a week, which means that you don\u2019t create dirty dishes/silverware/cookware on those days, and also means that grocery shopping is primarily for her benefit. \n\nSo it sure seems like you\u2019re bearing the brunt of the consequences for her decision, and her reluctance to step up and help you is IMO a big red flag.", "I go with ESH but neither of you is a big ahole.\n\nI think neither a 50/50 nor a 100/0 split is the correct answer here.", "NTA, but I think 100% is unfair because that's a huge workload.

But your situation and OP\u2019s situation (if we\u2019re going to take you both at your word) are different. His gf tells him she spends 24 hours on school, while he works 60 hours a day. He says he\u2019s burnt out and can\u2019t take on anymore. She hasn\u2019t. This isn\u2019t a diss on school or how exhausting it is.", "He also does his laundry, so it doesn't leave a whole lot to do truth be told", "Sure, she's still TA though. 0 empathy from her when he said he's burning out at this pace.", "Running a small business is also work. I work from home, therefore everyone thinks I'm always available and it should be no problem getting all the cleaning, cooking and shopping done. This attitude sucks, especially since I am the one providing the lifestyle!", "Then that is also part of the problem. \n\nWomen are not so special that they should not be pulling their weight. \n\nDO YOUR FUCKING CHORES PEOPLE.", "I work a full time job, study full time at uni while maintaining a 4.0 GPA and still manage to get all the chores done. \n\nAnd that includes the bigger chores like cleaning the oven and other shit. \n\nShe can do the chores if he's working all the hours he can to support them both fully.", "I never came close to 30-40 hours a week outside of finals week in Uni as a pre-med major.", "Pro tip. Stop throwing your laundry all over the house. \n\nThen it's just 2 mins to bring it to the machine and start it lol", "10 hours a week is *insane.* Literally no one cleans an apartment TEN hours worth every 7 days. Are there hordes of dust dropping animals & insects rambling through hourly? Do little leprechauns come out nightly & into the kitchen, spilling kegs? There is NO way this is happening.", "especially with no kids. Just 2 adults, one of which is barely at the house. yeah. 10 hours should have be able to eat off the floor.", "Your ability to retain learned information and individual ability/speed in completing assignments, as well as the amount of coursework assigned all play HUGE roles in how much time one spends on schoolwork outside of class. A paper that takes you 2-3 hours to research and write may take someone else 2-3 days, and what you may only need to hear once during a lecture to remember someone else may need hours of studying to retain. And without knowing what degree she\u2019s pursuing we really have no way of knowing what her course load might look like. For instance my fine arts degree (useless, I know) required large amounts of time devoted to working on assignments and I averaged around 30 hours a week working on my assignments outside of class, in addition to working full time and being a single mother, and if I didn\u2019t have a ridiculously good memory to where I never needed to study to pass a test I absolutely would\u2019ve either failed more than half of my classes or ended up in the hospital because I\u2019d have to omit sleep entirely to fit in studying too (I was already running myself ragged on 4-5 hours of sleep a night as it was), and my cousin\u2019s masters degree in marine biology had her devoting over 20 hours a week just on labs and experiments/studies outside of class and she still had to study and complete assignments on top of that, so she spent closer to 45-50 hours a week on her coursework outside of class/lectures. \n\nIt\u2019s great that you were able to juggle all of that, but just because you could doesn\u2019t mean others are slacking off because they need more time/learn slower than you did.", "I was not a very studious or naturally gifted person but I studied engineering and computer science and I was able to get A-B's in major specific and B-C's in general with about 35 hours a week, class time included in that. If she is aiming for all A's then I would guess it's a lot more than that, like 45+ hours.", "That\u2019s what it says on paper.\n\nWhether that\u2019s actually true, I can\u2019t really say, as I\u2019m actually the worst person to ask due to my own personal circumstances. \n\nI will say though that I\u2019ve personally noticed that the specific type of degree doesn\u2019t necessarily matter. Some people can do a 10 hour per week unit in an hour. Others may need to dedicate that full 10 hours per week or even more and still really struggle understanding/absorbing the material. \n\nAlso, some people only put in the bare minimum of work and are satisfied getting the credit, so maybe the logic is that if they\u2019d put in more work, they\u2019d get higher marks (even though they did pass)?", "I graduated law school and didn't even put that much effort each week lol", "Because you slacked doesn\u2019t mean everybody slacked.", "\ud83c\udf6a good for you.", "In my experience, most chores don\u2019t actually take that long to do, they\u2019re just tedious as fuck to do and that\u2019s where it can make things feel hectic, especially if you\u2019re already mentally drained or overwhelmed as it is. \n\nLike, doing laundry only *actually* takes me 15-30 minutes (from putting it in washer to putting it on line to getting it off line to folding and putting away), but it can be mentally taxing task. Admittedly, I have adhd tho, so what should only take me 15-30 minutes can easily bleed into double or even triple that amount of time. \n\nUnfortunately, this just seems to be a fact of being an adult. Chores are tedious as fuck but they still need to get done. \n\nIn that regard, I can sympathise with OP\u2019s girlfriend if she does feel overwhelmed, but, like I said, she\u2019s probably got more opportunity to be there to do the chores, and she\u2019s also got the opportunity to go back to school and broaden her horizons because OP is working easily 20+ hours more than her. I think it\u2019s only fair she take up keeping up the household. \n\nWhat she might need to do instead is reevaluate how she does things for example, like how much time she specifically spends on chores each day, what day each chore is done, making said chores easier on herself somehow (Roomba, air purification to help with dust, easier meal prep on a free day), etc.", "Yeah, we are in this awkward phase where women want everything equal but some women still feel they should be taken care of at the same time while wanting equality. Well that isn't equality. You need to pick one.", ">I typically use a washing line, or a drying rack, as opposed to a tumble-dryer (electricity be expensive), so I don't need to re-separate things?\n\nWell, that would just mean the sorting happens when you take it out of the washer. I actually empty it out of the dryer into two baskets, the workout things and non-workout things, which I prefer to sorting it all out of one pile.\n\nBut yeah, I would frequently have the two piles in front of me on the bed Sunday night thinking \"this should just take a minute\" and by the time everything is folded and hung, I'm late for bed. Eventually a couple of times I took note of the time before and after, and it seems to be about 20-25 minutes. Which I guess is pretty close to the 20 minutes you assign to wash and dry steps together. I might just do slightly larger loads than you do. \n\nAs for corralling laundry... I replied to another commenter, might just be a scatterbrain thing. But in fairness, there are things you wash \"when you're doing a load if there's room\" but don't or can't set aside as dirty. Even if I didn't leave clothes in random places, I would need to go look for jackets, towels, oven mitts, etc that could use washing.", "30 minutes total, not just to load. Loading like 5 minutes.", "Do you know what kind of people need to clean this much? People who don't know how not to make a mess in the first place. There are people who whose mind would probably be blown to find out it is possible to take a shower and not leave the bathroom looking like a disaster zone after a hurricane hit. \n\nThat and/or having some kind of obsession with cleaning.", "Yeah, the comments are really imping for the OP's gf, if the roles were reversed I know people would not be defending the dude who let his gf work 60+ hour work weeks, and wants an allowance and Saturdays to go out. We can all acknowledge that at least, right?", "Agreed. Social projects, labs, actual class time is pretty much non-negotiable and this is where different degrees could vary greatly.", "I agree with this. I can do similar or better work in 1/3 the time my \"academically challenged\" sibling. \n\nHowever they are adept with learning other things like music and languages where they can pick up an instrument (or new language) very quickly and even nail accents.  They very easily hear a song once, memorize it and play it on guitar or piano or some other instrument. \n\nI'm terrible in these areas and desperately avoided them in college.", "\nYeah, I took 26 credit load (more than twice what qualifies as full time student) and I didn't approach 40 hours a week in school work.  \n\nI could see large projects or group projects requiring some additional workload but not week to week, very week. \n\nAnd the idea that she can't do school and clean up an apartment? WTF (no job, no kids). This is just stupid. \n\nEspecially with him paying 100% of bills and working 10 hours a day. \n\nIf this is the split, get out of the relationship now. Life only gets busier with more to do and clean if they ever plan on having a family.  \n\nIf she can't handle school alone and picking up the apartment, he will eventually be stuck working his 60 hours a week, plus taking care of kids, plus cleaning and she will still be trying to manage her homework assignment.", "Yeah, I guess it was my own past coming out a bit instead of it being solely focused on this man's post. Assuming someone will be grateful and automatically assume a reasonable contribution without speaking about it is a little skewed. Definitely should've talked about it so she wasn't caught off guard. I'm just a grateful person and go out of my way. I'll definitely remember communicating first then hammering a person who doesn't see it. \ud83d\ude06 Solid lesson.\n\"DOMESTIC GODDESS\" had me laughing. The verbal drama I need in my life.", "Right? No one is saying hes allowed to be a slob. Like leaving dishes out and throwing clothes on the floor. When people say 100%, I presume they mean chores normally shared in some way. Even a SAH partner with no kids wouldn't deserve that.", "Except he is the one who suggested it. She should probably be doing more chores but it absolutely will feel like a bait and switch if he doesn't bring up this discussion carefully. It will very much feel like he only offered it so he could trick her into becoming dependent on him and make her a housewife.", "But the difference is he offered to do that. It wasn't in exchange for a service. He's changing the stipulations after the fact. If those had been the rules from the start, it would be different."]}
