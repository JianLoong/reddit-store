I always thought that this was weird but ultimately let the Mark and Judy parent their boys however they saw fit. A form of courtesy that tried to deny me when I decided to let my own children \"Ashely\" (9f) and \"Kyle\" (6m) grow up with Santa like I did. \n\nThey said that it was wrong because I was A) lying to my children, B) giving in to consumerism C) it gives kids a false sense of hope and D) allowing someone else to take credit for my own work. We got into many fights about this and I told them that if they brought this up again and/or tried to ruin Santa for my kids I would stop watching my nephews (which I did for free) for good. That got them to shut up and things were good for a while. Unfortunately, Todd and Tyler have gotten into a bad habit of believing that they were smarter than the other kids because they knew about Santa and got a  kick over trying to other children that Santa fake. \n\nI insisted that Mark, Judy, my parents, my husband and I all sit together with Todd and Tyler about how everyone else's households were different and that it was important to respect other people's rules and to not try and ruin Santa for other kids as it was mean. After that talk everything seemed to be good until a few days ago when I had Christmas at my house and Ashley and Kyle started to cry after opening all of their presents. Kyle screamed about how Santa wasn't real and that his dad and I were liars while Ashely just went into her room. Christmas was ruined and I had no idea why.\n\nAfter getting the kids to calm down they told us how the last time Todd and Tyler came over they told my kids about Santa and when they didn't believe them Tyler took Ashley and Kyle to the place where my husband and I were hiding the things that we got them for Christmas and said that if this was all that they were getting then it would prove the truth. I was furious and yelled at Mark about what happened while my husband sent a video of him showing the PS5 that we got for my nephews and saying that it was going back to the store to Tyler. \n\nMark and Judy don't have as much money as my husband and I do so basically our gift was going to be the best thing that Todd and Tyler were going to get and were upset. Judy called us and said that while the boys weren't exactly right it was cruel to take away their gift. This pissed us off even more and I sent a final text to Mark and Judy that I would no longer watch their kids for them and that we were canceling the college savings that we started for them and putting that money to therapy for the kids before blocking them. \n\nThis sent a bunch of relatives after us (mostly the ones without kids) calling us cruel.

Maybe the pretentiousness (about knowing the truth of Santa) was a way to feel good about themselves.", "Nta\nI mean, I don't think that playing into the Santa myth is great, but nothing you've said about how you handle it is over the top controlling \"be good or Santa won't bring you gifts\" manipulation. \n\nYou asked them politely and in an appropriate way to respect that your rules were different from theirs. They broke it, and you gave consequences.\n\nYou literally said not to ruin Santa for your kids as it would be mean. They chose to be mean, and are now finding out the consequences.", "NTA.

They aren't entitled to any niceties you do for them or their kids, and you can chose to cut that kindness off if they aren't going to show you and your family even a modicum of respect.

Santa Claus, Saint Nicholas was a man that helped people especially children, It is said that he gave away all of his inherited wealth and traveled the countryside helping the poor and sick. To continue his good will people came up with Santa Claus. He's not a person at all; he's an idea. Think of all those presents Santa gave you over the years. I actually bought those myself. I watched you open them. And did it bother me that you didn't thank me? Of course not! In fact it gave me great pleasure. You see, Santa Claus is THE IDEA OF GIVING FOR THE SAKE OF GIVING, without thought of thanks or acknowledgement.\n\n\"So now that you know, you're part of it. You have to be Santa Claus too now. That means you can never tell a young kid the secret, and you have to help us select Santa presents for them, and most important, you have to look for opportunities to help people. Got it?\"", "When my kid was told about Santa by rude older siblings of their friends, I told her that I would show her Santa. We went to an event and at the end they passed out the \"neediest cases\" that the local charity could not meet. A teenager wanted tennis shoes and a 6 yr old wanted a pretty dress. We went shopping to get the kids a very nice Christmas. On Christmas morning, I took her aside. We talked about how she made a miracle for a family.   Then two years later, younger kid asked if Santa were real. Older kid looked at her and said, \"This year we will introduce you to Santa\". And we did.\n\nSanta can be a terrible judgement and lie. Or a massive conspiracy of kindness, to which your children can be inducted.\n\nThey made it into cruelty.  They were mean little shits. They wanted a conspiracy of a shitty Christmas and they got it. Of course you should not give them a gift.  When they want a conspiracy of disappointment and tears, well they got it.\n\nTake time to heal. Maybe tell them you will not speak for X months.  If the other relatives want to buy them a console and pay for their college, they are welcome.\n\nNext year, hopefully you can save your kids memories and expand the conspiracy of kindness that is Santa at his best.", "NTA.

They at least have the excuse of being actual children. It also seems to me that if you were in fact watching your nephews, you know where you see them & keep them out of trouble, they wouldn\u2019t have been able to search your house & find where you kept the presents & your kids wouldn\u2019t have had time to count & inventory the presents.\nYTA.", "NTA you and your husband were providing free childcare, saving for their children\u2019s colleges and providing expensive gifts for Christmases yet they couldn\u2019t have the decency to speak to their children to show some respect and politeness towards others.

They can learn now that their \u201cfalse sense of hope\u201d is here to stay.", "YTA. Let me start by saying up front that I sympathize with you and your children. Todd and Tyler are definitely and heinously wrong, and they absolutely deserve consequences. But I think you\u2019re going scorched earth. Again, I understand why. You are parents who just watched their children have the entirety of the Christmas illusion unceremoniously shattered by people with cruel intentions. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to not give them the ps5; but making a rage fueled video about it and sending it directly to a **twelve \u2026 year old \u2026 boy** is about as unreasonable as it gets (and that\u2019s putting it nicely). No matter how justifiable your anger is, you\u2019re adults being cruel to children, and that will always make you assholes.\n\nFurthermore, the college fund is pretty overkill. They\u2019re 12 and 10. They were old enough to know better, but there is plenty of time and room for contrition and growth. It\u2019s your money and your choice, but consequences shouldn\u2019t be vengeful or designed to cause longterm harm; they should be targeted and purposeful with an eye towards teaching and rehabilitation. They\u2019re not going to learn anything from this, and that means that you\u2019re seeking revenge\u2026 **on CHILDREN.** \n\nI considered e s h, but I don\u2019t think Mark and Judy are assholes, and I also think relativity plays a role in this. 12 and 10 year old siblings did something thoughtlessly cruel to 9 and 6 year old siblings; so the adult parents of the latter did something pointedly cruel to the 12 and 10 year olds. These are not equivalent wrongs, and your age means you have exponentially less excuse not to know better. I find it difficult to label misbehaving preteens as assholes anyway, but after your disproportionate response, any asshole points they earned along the way are vitiated.", "YTA.\n\nThere is nothing weird about your brothers decision not to do the whole santa thing. It's his and his wife's choice to make, as it is yours and your husbands to do so. \n\nTodd and Tyler are children. What they did was not right, and they should be reminded to respect other people's boundaries. But they are children.\n\nYour husbands reaction to send those children, not their parents, but the children this video is childish at best. I get being angry, but this is not the response of an adult.\n\nAs for you - it is your choice to stop babysitting and to close the account but you too might want to consider what damage you will do with this.\n\nYour nephews took your children's opportunities to have santa for - let's assume - 3 more years at best. You might risk taking your own brother and nephews from you forever here.\nIf this situation causes such a hyper dramatic and long lasting response from your side I don't even want to know what an actual problem would warrant.\n\nI'd suggest cooling off, sitting your brother and your nephews on a table and talking.\nDecide how to proceed after.", "I am going to go with YTA because of your reaction and what you believe are appropriate consequences for something kids who are barely older than your own did. In fact one is less than a year older than your oldest. And for sending a video to a CHILD about returning the PS5. Your husband actually sent a video to a kid of him being malicious while accusing a child of being malicious? \n\nYour overreacted. Your 9 year old doesn't need therapy from finding out Santa isn't real. If she does you have other things to worry about. Even your 6 year old doesn't need therapy for this. Again, if they do, you have other things to be concerned over. \n\nIt's the level of malice coming from you and your husband that is the issue here, not being upset that they told your kids. You are holding children to a higher standard than you hold yourselves to.", "YTA. x10.\n\nNot giving them the PS5 could be part of a reasonable consequence, maybe. The message detailing it was petty.\n\nBut withdrawing he babysitting and the college savings? What the f is wrong with you? Truly.\n\nThese are kids. Kids do shitty things. Adults then have to provide feedback and consequences. Telling them that you are cancelling a college savings fund is so far beyond a reasonable consequence for kids at this age and for the behaviour, it's not even funny.\n\nThe kids need to be disciplined so they grow up to respect the boundaries of others. OP just needs to grow up.", "ESH but your kids.", "My goodness is sounds like such 1st world problems. Most kids who are smart enough realize there's no such thing as santa at about 7 or 8 years old anyway.
