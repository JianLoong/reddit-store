{"id": 6145, "submission_id": "1006d58", "title": "AITA For Getting Rid Of My Nephews Holiday Presents?", "selftext": "Throwaway Account\n\nI (39f) have two nephews through my brother \"Mark\" (43m), \"Todd\" (10m) and \"Tyler\" (12m) and despite my brother and I growing up with Santa, Mark and his wife \"Judy\" (43f) chose not to continue the tradition with their own kids so Tyler and Todd grew never believing. I always thought that this was weird but ultimately let the Mark and Judy parent their boys however they saw fit. A form of courtesy that tried to deny me when I decided to let my own children \"Ashely\" (9f) and \"Kyle\" (6m) grow up with Santa like I did.\n\nThey said that it was wrong because I was A) lying to my children, B) giving in to consumerism C) it gives kids a false sense of hope and D) allowing someone else to take credit for my own work. We got into many fights about this and I told them that if they brought this up again and/or tried to ruin Santa for my kids I would stop watching my nephews (which I did for free) for good. That got them to shut up and things were good for a while. Unfortunately, Todd and Tyler have gotten into a bad habit of believing that they were smarter than the other kids because they knew about Santa and got a  kick over trying to other children that Santa fake.\n\nI insisted that Mark, Judy, my parents, my husband and I all sit together with Todd and Tyler about how everyone else's households were different and that it was important to respect other people's rules and to not try and ruin Santa for other kids as it was mean. After that talk everything seemed to be good until a few days ago when I had Christmas at my house and Ashley and Kyle started to cry after opening all of their presents. Kyle screamed about how Santa wasn't real and that his dad and I were liars while Ashely just went into her room. Christmas was ruined and I had no idea why.\n\nAfter getting the kids to calm down they told us how the last time Todd and Tyler came over they told my kids about Santa and when they didn't believe them Tyler took Ashley and Kyle to the place where my husband and I were hiding the things that we got them for Christmas and said that if this was all that they were getting then it would prove the truth. I was furious and yelled at Mark about what happened while my husband sent a video of him showing the PS5 that we got for my nephews and saying that it was going back to the store to Tyler.\n\nMark and Judy don't have as much money as my husband and I do so basically our gift was going to be the best thing that Todd and Tyler were going to get and were upset. Judy called us and said that while the boys weren't exactly right it was cruel to take away their gift. This pissed us off even more and I sent a final text to Mark and Judy that I would no longer watch their kids for them and that we were canceling the college savings that we started for them and putting that money to therapy for the kids before blocking them.\n\nThis sent a bunch of relatives after us (mostly the ones without kids) calling us cruel. It's been a few days and I'm still upset so AITA?  \n\n\nETA: Because I keep seeing the same statement/questions in the comments or DMs here are my responses/answers....  \n\n\n1. I was in the kitchen preparing lunch when Todd and Tyler showed my kids where the presents were. They are all old enough where I could leave them alone for a few moments.\n2. I still don't know how Todd and Tyler knew where my husband and I kept the presents and honestly I'm not sure it matters anymore.\n3. It's been days after the fact and Kyle has seemingly lost all trust in my husband and I while still throwing tantrums. Ashley either cries on-and-off and barely talks. Plus neither of the kids have touched their presents after opening them and that's why my husband and I are considering therapy.\n4. The college money is in an average savings account that is just designated for the boys so my husband and I are free to do with it as we please. \n5. I didn't find out about my husband doing the video and sending it until after the fact and while I do agree with not giving them the PS5 and I didn't agree with the video part but I'm not going to give my husband hell over it. \n6. I've completely blocked Mark and Judy everywhere that I could and my husband threatened to call the cops if they showed up at the door.\n7. My parents think that Todd and Tyler were wrong, that Mark hasn't done enough to prevent their behavior, and wants to give everyone a couple more days to cool off before having a family discussion.\n8. Todd and Tyler have gone out of their way to tell other kids at their school and were reprimanded for it so this is repeated behavior. They did it because they felt smarter than the other kids. \n9. I'm honestly at a point right now where I don't know if I ever want to see or speak to my nephews again because all I'm focused on is the pain they intentionally caused my children.\n10. No, I would not forgive Todd and Tyler if they apologized because the damage is already done and we can't go back plus I'd question the authenticity of their remorse since they are upset about the PS5.

Though you did go for the nuclear option. It was cruel to ruin santa for your kids.", "I am going to say NTA. \n\nI wonder if those kids did it because they\u2019re resentful. They\u2019re at the age where kids can recognize when things are financially-tight in their household. And they must see the difference in wealth, when they come to your home.

They broke it, and you gave consequences.\n\nYou literally said not to ruin Santa for your kids as it would be mean. They chose to be mean, and are now finding out the consequences.", "NTA. Seems like Todd and Tyler agreed to not say Santa is fake when you discussed it earlier and they went back on this agreement. They should learn that actions have consequences.

They aren't entitled to any niceties you do for them or their kids, and you can chose to cut that kindness off if they aren't going to show you and your family even a modicum of respect.

Taking away the PS5 was suitable.\n\nI think you may regret going after their college fund and refusing to look after them ever again. While I think what they did was wrong, and I think they deserve to have consequences, you are being very harsh. You are of course, under no obligation to educate them or babysit them.

Santa Claus, Saint Nicholas was a man that helped people especially children, It is said that he gave away all of his inherited wealth and traveled the countryside helping the poor and sick. To continue his good will people came up with Santa Claus. He's not a person at all; he's an idea. Think of all those presents Santa gave you over the years. I actually bought those myself. I watched you open them. And did it bother me that you didn't thank me? Of course not! In fact it gave me great pleasure. You see, Santa Claus is THE IDEA OF GIVING FOR THE SAKE OF GIVING, without thought of thanks or acknowledgement.\n\n\"So now that you know, you're part of it. You have to be Santa Claus too now. That means you can never tell a young kid the secret, and you have to help us select Santa presents for them, and most important, you have to look for opportunities to help people.", "When my kid was told about Santa by rude older siblings of their friends, I told her that I would show her Santa. We went to an event and at the end they passed out the \"neediest cases\" that the local charity could not meet. A teenager wanted tennis shoes and a 6 yr old wanted a pretty dress. We went shopping to get the kids a very nice Christmas. On Christmas morning, I took her aside. We talked about how she made a miracle for a family.   Then two years later, younger kid asked if Santa were real. Older kid looked at her and said, \"This year we will introduce you to Santa\". And we did.\n\nSanta can be a terrible judgement and lie. Or a massive conspiracy of kindness, to which your children can be inducted.\n\nThey made it into cruelty.  They were mean little shits. They wanted a conspiracy of a shitty Christmas and they got it. Of course you should not give them a gift.  When they want a conspiracy of disappointment and tears, well they got it.\n\nTake time to heal. Maybe tell them you will not speak for X months.  If the other relatives want to buy them a console and pay for their college, they are welcome.\n\nNext year, hopefully you can save your kids memories and expand the conspiracy of kindness that is Santa at his best.", "NTA.

They at least have the excuse of being actual children.

They can learn now that their \u201cfalse sense of hope\u201d is here to stay.", "YTA. Let me start by saying up front that I sympathize with you and your children. Todd and Tyler are definitely and heinously wrong, and they absolutely deserve consequences. But I think you\u2019re going scorched earth. Again, I understand why. You are parents who just watched their children have the entirety of the Christmas illusion unceremoniously shattered by people with cruel intentions. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to not give them the ps5; but making a rage fueled video about it and sending it directly to a **twelve \u2026 year old \u2026 boy** is about as unreasonable as it gets (and that\u2019s putting it nicely). No matter how justifiable your anger is, you\u2019re adults being cruel to children, and that will always make you assholes.\n\nFurthermore, the college fund is pretty overkill. They\u2019re 12 and 10. They were old enough to know better, but there is plenty of time and room for contrition and growth. It\u2019s your money and your choice, but consequences shouldn\u2019t be vengeful or designed to cause longterm harm; they should be targeted and purposeful with an eye towards teaching and rehabilitation. They\u2019re not going to learn anything from this, and that means that you\u2019re seeking revenge\u2026 **on CHILDREN.** \n\nI considered e s h, but I don\u2019t think Mark and Judy are assholes, and I also think relativity plays a role in this. 12 and 10 year old siblings did something thoughtlessly cruel to 9 and 6 year old siblings; so the adult parents of the latter did something pointedly cruel to the 12 and 10 year olds. These are not equivalent wrongs, and your age means you have exponentially less excuse not to know better. I find it difficult to label misbehaving preteens as assholes anyway, but after your disproportionate response, any asshole points they earned along the way are vitiated.", "YTA.\n\nThere is nothing weird about your brothers decision not to do the whole santa thing. It's his and his wife's choice to make, as it is yours and your husbands to do so. \n\nTodd and Tyler are children. What they did was not right, and they should be reminded to respect other people's boundaries. But they are children.\n\nYour husbands reaction to send those children, not their parents, but the children this video is childish at best. I get being angry, but this is not the response of an adult.\n\nAs for you - it is your choice to stop babysitting and to close the account but you too might want to consider what damage you will do with this.\n\nYour nephews took your children's opportunities to have santa for - let's assume - 3 more years at best. You might risk taking your own brother and nephews from you forever here.\nIf this situation causes such a hyper dramatic and long lasting response from your side I don't even want to know what an actual problem would warrant.\n\nI'd suggest cooling off, sitting your brother and your nephews on a table and talking.\nDecide how to proceed after.", "I am going to go with YTA because of your reaction and what you believe are appropriate consequences for something kids who are barely older than your own did. In fact one is less than a year older than your oldest. And for sending a video to a CHILD about returning the PS5. Your husband actually sent a video to a kid of him being malicious while accusing a child of being malicious? \n\nYour overreacted. Your 9 year old doesn't need therapy from finding out Santa isn't real. If she does you have other things to worry about. Even your 6 year old doesn't need therapy for this. Again, if they do, you have other things to be concerned over. \n\nIt's the level of malice coming from you and your husband that is the issue here, not being upset that they told your kids. You are holding children to a higher standard than you hold yourselves to.", "YTA. x10.\n\nNot giving them the PS5 could be part of a reasonable consequence, maybe. The message detailing it was petty.\n\nBut withdrawing he babysitting and the college savings? What the f is wrong with you? Truly.\n\nThese are kids. Kids do shitty things. Adults then have to provide feedback and consequences. Telling them that you are cancelling a college savings fund is so far beyond a reasonable consequence for kids at this age and for the behaviour, it's not even funny.\n\nThe kids need to be disciplined so they grow up to respect the boundaries of others. OP just needs to grow up.", "ESH but your kids.", "My goodness is sounds like such 1st world problems.

It\u2019s vindictive and with the parents \u201cmoralistic\u201d beliefs on this I whole heartedly believe that they were encouraged to do so. \n\nThe parents are responsible for the college fund of their own children.

They will get over it as everyone does, and you can help them by explaining that you didn't lie out of malice but wanted them to take part in tradition and childhood fun. Literally everyone should get therapy, but I don't think this warrants it specifically. Kids throw tantrums and get mad, it's also a part of childhood.

Idk if you plan on having more kids, but in my house, I (oldest) was informed that if I didn't believe in Santa, he would stop giving me presents. Guess what?

While it's not your job to provide for them, you were willing to do this until you felt slighted by them. Kids are gonna be jerks.

Be prepared for all sorts of things to crop up.\n\nI'll end with one of my favourite quotes:\n\n\u201cAll right,\" said Susan. \"I'm not stupid. You're saying humans need... fantasies to make life bearable.\"\n\nREALLY? AS IF IT WAS SOME KIND OF PINK PILL? NO. HUMANS NEED FANTASY TO BE HUMAN.

YOU HAVE TO START OUT LEARNING TO BELIEVE THE LITTLE LIES.\n\n\"So we can believe the big ones?\"\n\nYES. JUSTICE. MERCY. DUTY. THAT SORT OF THING.\n\n\"They're not the same at all!\"\n\nYOU THINK SO? THEN TAKE THE UNIVERSE AND GRIND IT DOWN TO THE FINEST POWDER AND SIEVE IT THROUGH THE FINEST SIEVE AND THEN SHOW ME ONE ATOM OF JUSTICE, ONE MOLECULE OF MERCY. AND YET\u2014Death waved a hand. AND YET YOU ACT AS IF THERE IS SOME IDEAL ORDER IN THE WORLD, AS IF THERE IS SOME...SOME RIGHTNESS IN THE UNIVERSE BY WHICH IT MAY BE JUDGED.\n\n\"Yes, but people have got to believe that, or what's the point\u2014\"\n\nMY POINT EXACTLY.\u201d\n\n\u2015 Terry Pratchett, Hogfather", "There is a lovely letter available online that explains it for children to understand. While we didn\u2019t give ours the actual letter we did decide to explain it in a very similar way. Search \u2018is Santa real letter\u2019 and you\u2019ll find it. It can hopefully give you a starting point at least.", "It\u2019s also only been a week. It\u2019s going to take some time and your and your husband\u2019s stress is likely feeding your kids\u2019 negative feelings as well.

Don\u2019t waste mental energy on your brother\u2019s family until you\u2019ve found some equilibrium in your own.", "Technically, the way you frame Santa is your business. Some people just tell their kids it's a fairy tale type story, which works for them. Some people ignore the whole Santa story, which works for them. Some people swear that Santa comes down the chimney.\n\nWhat's disheartening about this whole shitstorm is that your nephews gleefully destroyed your version of Santa. Purposefully. With malice.\n\nThe truest form of feck around and find out.\n\nEdit: NTA", "Hope that you'll see this OP, and it may not be too late to save your kids Christmas.\n\nMaybe try the \"Santa's helper\" angle. That Santa has so many kids to visit on Christmas, that sometimes he comes early and asks parents to hide the gifts until Christmas, or something like that.\n\nSimilar to the whole, \"mummy is Santa's dry cleaner\" after kids find dads Santa suit in the closet.\n\nI mean, I still held on to my belief in Santa even after others had told me \"the truth\". My parents were pretty clever with it. We open presents on Xmas eve, and they were very good at sneaking them under the tree when we were kids, and we could have sworn that they'd just appear from no where.\n\nDon't give up on the Christmas spirit for them, you might still be able to save the magic.", "I don't think that telling your kids the truth about Santa was the real problem. Your kids reaction was because they pushed the \"your parents are lying to you, and this will prove it\" bit.\n\nAll of us who believed found out one way or another, but few of us hated our parents for it.\n\nNTA.

It's NEVER our place to tell Santa's Secret!\n\nAt 3.5 years old, mine had enough respect for others to not spoil the fun for other children. \n\nTheir line about just telling the truth is complete BS.", "First of all\nSanta is not a lie. There was a real \u201cSanta\u201d (St Nicolas)it\u2019s a legend based on an old tradition that got adopted by the main stream due to the poem called The Night before Christmas. So not a lie. The spirit of joy and giving are what we do to honor St. Nick and we as parent become Santa to spread that joy to the children St Nicolas was so fond of helping. So Santa while not a physical person in the flesh is not a lie.\n\nSecondly,\nFaith. All belief could be considered a lie. God could be a lie. Love could be a lie. Luck, fame, control, \u2026all lies. The only thing we use to justify it is faith. The simple act of belief despite \u201cproof\u201d or even \u201cevidence\u201d to the contrary makes it true. It\u2019s true **because** we believe, we don\u2019t believe because it\u2019s true. Santa is one of our first tests of faith. Want do we do when we first learn the \u201ctruth\u201d\u2026do we give up and stop believing? Do we try to counter the proof or look for further evidence? Do we become jaded and mean like your nefews? Or do we further our belief and use the knowledge to form a deeper belief?  \n\nWhat we do once our first belief is challenged defines how we grow and change for life. It shapes how we take criticism and use critical thinking to balance pure faith. And it\u2019s awesome. \n\nTell your kids that while the presents weren\u2019t delivered by a jolly guy in a sleigh powered by reindeer, the sentiment was the same. You allowed them to believe in Santa because ***you*** **still believe in Santa**! You believe that joy should be shared and Christmas should be magical. You believe that faith is more powerful when everyone else insist that it isn\u2019t true. Hello Christianity! You believe that gifts given with no thought to receiving anything back, even credit, are the very purest form of giving! Playing Santa made you happy and them happy too, so what\u2019s wrong with that?", "Just because it's true doesn't mean you need to say it.

I let him know that he can never just blurt it out to any kids younger than him, that he can help with the spirit of it. He is allowed to talk about it with other kids once he knows that they already know.\n\nHe agreed, said it was a cool thing to keep a magical secret, and he even helped us encourage his little brother. No sign of maliciousness anywhere! (And this kid is going through a meanie phase right now in regards to his little brother but he still kept the secret!)", "Pissing off their gift-giving uncle *before* Christmas wasn't so smart. A smarter kid would have waited until after he'd gotten the nice gift.", "Your nephews (and by extension, their parents) were the AH's here because this was absolutely malicious and the parents are defending it, but the way you are reacting to this, and the way your kids are reacting, makes me think you probably really hyped Santa and were invested in the bit to an unhealthy degree also. Your 9 yo was probably about to figure it out anyway, and fat chance the younger one wouldnt have caught on soon afterward. Cutting your nephews off forever over them doing asshole things (like kids do) is ott.\n\nTo offer some perspective, I have huge feelings about people making Santa \"real\" for their kids because when I figured it out at around the same age as your kids (not because someone told me), it sparked a domino effect of losing all the other make-believe that people tell kids is real- the tooth fairy, the Easter bunny, etc. It felt like a betrayal. Like my parents had lied to me consistently over time, like they were playing some horrible joke on me where they-and all the other adults I trusted- were prettu much making fun of me for being gullible. It impacted my trust in adults generally and my parents in particular for years, and it also made me question a lot of things they told me about God and other things that required me to just trust them. \n\nTo make it worse, before I got it put together, I had realized that kids with rich parents got more from Santa than poor kids like me. Like they must be better and more deserving because santa knows who's good and who's not, right? So it was a serious double whammy to realize i felt shitty and less-than because my parents thought it would be cute to lie to me. I really wish parents thought the ramifications through before committing to the bit, because I know I'm not the only one who feels this way. \n\nI'm not saying you're TA, just that you should try to put all of this in some kind of perspective and consider therapy for all of you. I am particularly struck that you are saying you'll never forgive nephews even if they apologize because they can't undo what they did- they're kids and you're an adult they trust. Don't do something to them that can't be taken back.", "Yes. The attitude of thinking they are smarter than everyone else comes from the parents. If the parents had a different attitude about people who celebrate the tradition of Santa, the kids would have too.", "These reactions seem a bit much. I wonder if something else occurred", "OP please find out what else those boys said to your children. your children's reaction is not normal. They were much more cruel and hateful then just saying Santa is not real when they said it and did it. You have to find out so that the therapy can help. And by the way I'd have gone nuclear too.", "Do Not foot the bill for their college. Your children will know that even if they are hurt by your nephews, you would still side with the nephews if you did that. Since your nephews \u201ctechnically told the truth\u201d, you should tell them that their parents need to technically pay for their childcare, Chrismas presents and college. You were being Santa for them but they don\u2019t believe in Santa.", "But they would have eventually learned of their parents lies with or without the cousins and been betrayed.", "Not implying the ps5 or college funds are obligations OP or OP's husband have to supply but if they felt comfortable enough to start one for the nephews it seems nuclear to cancel it over something relatively minor and they are still very much young kids. And to never see them again especially if she used to babysit often- that just seems unnecessarily harsh from adults one would assume cared for the nephews.  Apparently a lot of people agree with OP but at that age the nephews are probably old enough to see the difference- cousins getting more expensive Christmas gifts and also getting to believe in Santa while they didn't. Doesn't excuse their behavior but also not too surprising they might act out.", "Not disagreeing but at 10? That's kind of a lot to expect from kids getting to see first hand wealth disparity and differing parenting styles. Telling them why they aren't getting a ps5 and  how their actions hurt their cousins is one thing but a video? Canceling funding for future education over a relatively minor mistake? Those actions seem cruel for an adult to do to children one would assume they also care about- or at least enough to fund it in the first place and babysit.

This seems unlikely to change over the next 6-8 years. \n\nYour relationship, prior to this incident, seemed to be one where they benefitted from your generosity - with childcare, college funds, and gifts. Refusing to give them anything extra going forward will mean that if they make amends, you know it\u2019s genuine. For that reason alone, it may be worth cutting them off (financially) for good.\n\nETA - NTA", "OP- I think that the issue isn't simply finding out Santa isn't real.  You only know the bare bones of the conversation, but based on your kids reaction it sounds like your nephews really placed emphasis on you and your husband lying to your kids. \n \nTherapy is a good idea.  It doesn't have to be long term, but your kids have feelings that they need to unpack and you and your husband will get the feedback you need to help your family move forward.

My sister and I both found out years before we admitted it to our family - I caught them putting out the presents, she was told at school. We let our parents and grandma think we believed. This was in the 80s. I find it very hard to believe that a child with internet access doesn't know.\n\nI feel like there's a sweet spot where you can transition the kids from believing in the magic of Santa into really understanding that we all create the \"magic\" of Santa for each other.

No Playstation for the organised disenchantment of many minors.", "I see there as being two sets of punishment here for two different sets of people. The boys lose their gift: that's their punishment. The parents lose the free babysitting and the help with college $ - that's their punishment for raising entitled AHs and then not taking appropriate action when the boys screw up. Because you know that the boys took their attitude from them. College is too far away for these boys to care about that; the PS5 is the point for them.", "Paying for college is too large a gift to give to entitled a-holes.

Honestly, YTA OP.  Taking away the gift is fine. But taking away an education for an act someone did at 10?

Nothing OP does is going to make a dent in the arrogance and entitlement those parents have built in their kids.

You're right that their reaction isn't normal; I think the cousins were a lot more evil, and that's what OP is reacting to in a justified way.", "No because they would have come to the conclusion ON THEIR OWN and talked to their parents.  They wouldn\u2019t have had superior little sh*ts maliciously telling them the truth.

I do understand why she's so angry, but I also think that in a few months, their relationships will be on the way to improvement. My initial comment was a parent's kneejerk reaction.", "From my reading, unless I got this topic confused with another,  both of the children were also doing this to younger children at school so it wasn't a one time mistake, and in those instances they were not specifically asked not to do so, and not by relatives. Still crummy imo. If I am correct,  that has zero to do with first hand looks at wealth disparity and/or differing parenting styles.", "I don't think the issue is really the kids finding out about Santa, that was always going to happen.

That's not a small thing, those kids wanted to ruin Christmas and they succeeded.", "How dare I?  You are questioning OP for canceling a college fund for children that she has no obligation to support?  Pray tell how is that not entitled thinking?
