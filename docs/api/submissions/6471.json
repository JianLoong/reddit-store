She's really crossing the line and must respect some clear boundaries I don't even have to mention.\n\nThe problem here isn't they sometimes feel like their grandkids are their own children, but actually trying to undermine your role as a parent.", "NTA. You are allowed to be upset and they are overstepping your boundaries. Yes they are helping you out which is great but you are paying rent, childcare costs and cooking/cleaning. They're benefitting from you being there too. If they cant respect your boundaries you should look for other accommodations.", "NTA.\nSpeaking from the viewpoint of a mom, there is one thing to form a bond, which is good. But there is another to refer to ones grandchild as ones child when it isn't, especially without your consent and knowledge. \n\nThey are helping you out and you are paying your stepmom to care for your child until she can go to the daycare you work at. But that doesn't mean she can hog your daughter from you when you come home and want to hold your baby. She is TA for this and needs to stop right now.\n\nWhen your daughter can be at the daycare, try to find somewhere else to stay so this scenario is put to an end.

Withholding your child from you is especially scary, and your dad referring to your daughter as your stepmom's is also a cause for concern. I would be worried that they might try to use the police/legal system to take your daughter away from you, especially since your stepmom is already espousing concerns about you caring for your own daughter and implying that you're incapable or incompetent. Given all this together, I'd be seriously concerned about their motives. NTA.", "YOU ARE NTA!!  You are kicking ass for having a baby at 20 and ON TOP of that seem to have a fantastic plan to take of you two!  I would also have a hard time hearing them call her their child and I\u2019m guessing you might even have a bit of guilt for not being with her all day. Women who have children and who want a career are fucked and held to some weird standard about not being able to do both.  Absolutely let them know that you aren\u2019t ok with them referring to your daughter that and be as respectful as you can :)\n\nPS - don\u2019t rule out schooling in the future. It took me awhile to realize I was excited about learning new skills later in life :).", "NTA but I would start looking for a new place to live and childcare ASAP. Do not let them withhold you from picking up your child.", "Beware that they may be planning to take custody of your child.", "NTA for being upset, it is inappropriate for your stepmom to deny you doing anything (safe) with your child. You are her mom!\n\nA but TA for your response to that particular comment - grouping a child in with their \u201clittle babies\u201d is not the same as claiming your child as theirs.", "NAH potentially NTA-\n\nIt\u2019s important that boundaries be clear with all of you, as well as relationship roles. \n\nYou are all supporting each other and working like a family unit- and considering your history with your dad- it totally makes sense why it would push your buttons to watch him take an active parenting role with your brothers and daughter. He\u2019s giving them what he should have been giving you. \n\nAnd it is true: if they are spending their time caring for their granddaughter along with their sons, she is just going to feel like one of the kids they love.\n\nHowever, what is troubling is not letting you hold or feed your daughter, trying to extend this situation- And without context- accusing you of manipulating them. \n\nI would 100% make sure to start your child in that nursery when you do. I would also see if you can reach out to a counselor or social worker and see what you can do to start documenting this situation- so that if the worst happens and your parents try to get custody. You will want someone on your side to help you put things together to say: \u201cOP worked full time, was an active participant in the household and payed for childcare. She was not a negligent parent.\u201d If you need help finding these resources- try calling women\u2019s shelters and organizations. You are obviously not in a DV situation: but these folks are often plugged into resources that can help. \n\nAlso- when things cool off, explain to your step-mom that it is absolutely not okay for her to refuse to let you hold or feed your daughter. And the more upset she gets: the calmer and clearer you get. Do not give her any excuse ever to paint you out to be a danger to your kid. \n\nSecretly record conversations  and keep records if you find her twisting things. They may not be legal where you live- but they may also help you get the help you need. \n\nBut hopefully, none of it will come to this and you all can work this out as a family.", "NTA?\nI honestly don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the wrong nor the right, same with your parents. I hope you show them your appreciation for taking care of your child (even though she\u2019s paid, but still). Now i think \u201clittle babies\u201d might be miscommunication from their side, and they don\u2019t see how you think this is wrong. Can\u2019t say ESH as your parents seem supportive and nice to you, don\u2019t push them away!", "I think NAH personally. You all could likely do with a good sit down communication to talk about how you feel. It is understandable that they have a close bond with your baby since they spend so much time together. It is also understandable that as a new mother with a lot of time away from home that you would have complicated feelings about that, particularly given your past with your father.", "NAH- You are 8 month\u2019s postpartum, and are in a time consuming apprenticeship. You also do chores and cook. You are tired!\n\nYour parents are taking on the bulk of the childcare so of course they\u2019re going to bond with your daughter. Step Mom has a baby 2 months older so I get it\u2019s like they\u2019re currently being raised like siblings.\n\nHer not allowing you to hold you baby is a bit much, end of the day you are her mother. \n\n Calling both babies their babies is speaking in generalities and nothing to be upset by, especially when they were talking to someone who knows they\u2019re the grandparents.\n\nSide note: I am terrible at math, I\u2019m talking about could hardly pass easy HS math terrible. In college I was so scared to take a math class. I went to my professors office hours got help from him, also explained it was the only math class I had to pass to transfer to a Uni, and made sure to turn in all my work and I passed!! \n\nI graduated from Uni many years ago, and have a very successful career. My point is don\u2019t let fear stop you from going to college. If I can pass a math class I have full faith that you can too!!", "NTA but it is also not a big deal as you moved in with them and rely on them to help raise your child. \n\nYou are also picking a very low paying profession, which is not a bad thing, but you may require their help in the future too.", "NAH.\n\nYour dad might have been a little insensitive, but it sounds like he's speaking from genuine affection for his granddaughter. You might have been a little over sensitive, but not in any sort of asshole-ish way, you're under a lot of stress.  \n\nSounds like you're setting yourself up on a good path in the not-too-distant future. Keep it up, you'll do very well when you have a bit more independence and space alone with your daughter.", "I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s the asshole here to be honest. You\u2019re trying your best but you need to appreciate everything your dad and stepmom do for you while taking care of your kid. Your dad putting pressure on you for uni can seem like a nightmare but don\u2019t put yourself down, you may be able to if you just put more into it. Your stepmom does seem a bit OTT by not letting you hold your baby, how does she think you managed before you moved in. Try and make a statement by spending as much time as possible with baby in front of her, and if she asks to have her just say \u201cNo we\u2019re having mummy daughter time now\u201d to really press in the point that she\u2019s your baby and not stepmums. Tbh i think it\u2019s just a lot of people with good intentions being over the top.", "I think NAH\n\nYour daughter can never have too many people in her life that will truly love & care for her. Until you have the opportunity to get out on your own I think you will need to accept your dad & step-mother\u2019s help & appreciate that your daughter is being cared for so you can make a future for the both of you. This is not a competition for your daughter. You already won. You\u2019re her mother.\n\nedit correction", "Soft YTA because I understand your pov but when someone says \u201cmy little babies\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean that they are claiming that it is their child.

Sometimes I\u2019ll say \u201clook at my little baby/babies\u201d but I don\u2019t mean it as that\u2019s my child.", "I might be in the minority, but I think YTA.\n\nNot by much though, seems like you have a lot going on, and are frustrated by not being able to spend enough time with your baby. I would not care if my parents called my son their baby. I would be happy they love him enough to say that. The step mother not letting you hold or feed your baby is a bit shitty though.", "YTA imo and overreacting. Would you prefer your father and step mom to not love your baby? Of course they have bonded. You are all living together and they are taking care of your child everyday. It\u2019s just a small slip in their language. I don\u2019t believe your dad has some hidden agenda for suggesting university. Like every parent, he wants you to succeed in life. Going to university will allow you to build a better life for you and your child. I think you are just frustrated that you can\u2019t spend enough time with your daughter. But that\u2019s no reason to lash out at your parents.", "Light YTA I do think you\u2019re overreacting. This isn\u2019t a big deal.", "Yeah, light YTA.\n\nYou moved in for assistance and are getting childcare and help with the baby.

It only took a few overnight stays before we bonded and there was and still is nothing that I wouldn't do for them. I chalk it up to human decency, and the instinct to protect and love the most precious and vulnerable among us. Time and circumstance played a significant role too. We simply spent more time together, ergo we had more experiences together. They didn't care that I wasn't their parent, and I didn't care that they weren't my children. Naturally, I could sense apprehension from their parents when the babies looked to me to calm them, feed them, and comfort them. Babies don't know any better, and I wasn't going to deny them. Nothing I did or continue to do is malicious. I say all this to say that I empathize with your Dad and stepmother, but you as well.

There is no not allowing you when it comes to your daughter. You are being too nice. Do not allow your father\u2019s wife to withhold your child from you for even one second. Stop trying to be so nice.", "NTA. Should of snapped at you stepmother for not letting you hold/feed/walk YOUR own child.", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re **paying** them!!! That\u2019s money you could be using to get yourself moved out and separated from them. They\u2019re overstepping babysitters who unfortunately have your housing situation to use against you.\n\nI think that leaving should be your focus, moving out and being independent. This doesn\u2019t sound like a good situation.", "NTA but it takes one 'anonymous' call from mom or dad to CPS and they'll get custody. Plan your escape now", "NTA. Perhaps he should practice being *your* dad.", "NTA", "NTA you might want to look into wither the school you go to has childcare for students", "NTA- \n\nBE EXTRA CAREFUL AND TIGHT WITH YOUR MONEY SO YOU CAN GET OUT OF THERE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.  \n\nIn the meantime, keep your head down & hold on til you get your baby in your daycare. That sounds like a GREAT plan. \n\nAlso, don't let that lady keep your baby from you.  Stay calm but firm. \"She's MY baby. I need time to bond with her. I can take it from here just fine. Thank you for all your help.\" \n\nBut try not to rock the boat so much because I suspect they will try to use it against you, paint you as immature & hold things over your head. Best wishes.", "definitely NTA. It's pretty weird how someone not even blood related is treating your child as their own, and while that may not really matter about blood relations much, it's still a little bit odd to me. Also kinda suspicious how stepmother sometimes doesn't let you hold or feed your own baby, I definitely wouldn't go to university in this situation, because they may make a huge bond with your baby while you're away. I would personally save up as much money so you can get out of there ASAP.", "You need to move out with your daughter, and pay someone else to babysit. They are pushing boundaries, and can try to say you are \"negligent\" later on if you are not around. \n\nNTA", "NTA .. they want you to go to school so they can go to court and say you abandoned the child.", "Parents don\u2019t get paid to \u201cbabysit\u201d their kids, if they feel like parents why do they accept payment to babysit. You pay rent, do chores and cook for everyone, those are very legitimate parts of parenting a child. They sound toxic tbh, good for you for working so hard and try to not let it get to you and plan for a life away from them asap. My biggest fear would be them trying to get custody or adopt your daughter. Be safe!", "NTA. You're 20, you're not 13. She won't let you hold your own baby because she is anxious about your age ? You need to get out of there, these people think your baby is a do over for them.", "NTA. You\u2019re paying your own way. They\u2019re not even doing you a favor, but they\u2019re sure acting like it.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA hard spot you are in. Praying for you", "Please calmly talk to him about this concern.  You may be worrying needlessly.  \n\nEncouraging you to study further may be so that you have a stable future.  Accidentally calling your daughter the wrong thing is easy to do - I often mix my own family's names up too.  Check his motives.  I hope that your concerns are calmed.  Fingers crossed.", "Especially since OP is literally a childcare worker!", "The real problem is that OP is entirely dependent on these people, and therefore doesn't have many choices at the moment that won't make life more difficult for her.\n\nUnless of course, whatever she is paying for childcare is enough to put her kid into daycare. Even then, she is living with them.", "I wouldn't be surprised if they were playing \"happy little family\" while you were gone and are calling themselves mom & dad. Dad's trying to get you to go to university to get you further away from your daughter. (Don't want to overly scare you but they might try for custody saying you're too busy and showing how they \"raised\" her instead of you. Not unheard of around here!) \n\nThey have done more than boundary stomp. They're trying to manipulate you by saying it's not really a big deal, etc. Can you get any money from the state? NTA", "\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc", "This! Why not get another day sitter while you\u2019re at work? Definitely move asap.", "also they are clearly abusive and the manipulators, ops question \"aita for crying\" is enough to know that. a person is never an asshole for crying no matter the situation, throwing tamptrums and yelling is a different thing, but showing emotions in a heathly way (like crying) is never an asshole thing to do, they are abusing her into not trusting her own feelings and trying to invalidate them for their own gain. \n\nso yeah, they would def go so far as to sue. hopefully they just want to use her and will forget about it when she leaves. theyre clearly on a powertrip", "Good for you if you beat the odds. I am guessing you didnt blow off basic math in HS. Our politicians have been working hard to make sure most women in this situation dont have access to cheap child care or remedial education. You can pretend to be superwoman and call me names, but i am more than a little skeptical that you started where she is.", "NTA - they\u2019re already crossing some boundaries. No one gets to tell a mom she can\u2019t feed, walk, or hold her baby when she wants to. Your stepmom is out of line for that.  And while your dad and stepmom are being very supportive, it does look like they\u2019re enjoying helping raise your daughter like their own.  Definitely establish boundaries that you\u2019re comfortable with.  Get child support from baby daddy. Continue to stand up for yourself.", "Yeah, I think that it is more likely that they are not charging her that much compared to market rates- but it IS Reddit- so ya never know.", "Someone who thinks name-calling is a valid way of communicating doesn\u2019t really have any credibility in my book. But it certainly makes sense that you would never expect to hold a woman accountable for anything.\n\nNo woman can ever be irresponsible. No woman can ever make bad decisions. No woman can ever be dysfunctional.\n\nBut no one ever has a problem when we say this stuff about men.\n\nYes, blaming people who fail at life can indeed be a lesson to others.", "It's his daughter. The market rate for caring for your own daughter is $0 specially when she is a single morher in need. Not kicking out your young pregnant daughter is nor a good deal, it's the bare minimum.\n\nIf you want to treat your daughter as a stranger then sign a contract and pay her for the cooking and the chores the same way she pays for daycare and rent. This one sided \"arrangement\" is basically financial abuse. Oh, and they are also trying to steal her baby.", "Stereotypical internet manosphere dude. Huge hypocrite who I called a jerk but he's cool to go around telling people they're failures at life. \n\nGet over yourself and your woman issues"]}
