She's really crossing the line and must respect some clear boundaries I don't even have to mention.\n\nThe problem here isn't they sometimes feel like their grandkids are their own children, but actually trying to undermine your role as a parent.", "NTA. You are allowed to be upset and they are overstepping your boundaries. Yes they are helping you out which is great but you are paying rent, childcare costs and cooking/cleaning. They're benefitting from you being there too. If they cant respect your boundaries you should look for other accommodations.", "NTA.\nSpeaking from the viewpoint of a mom, there is one thing to form a bond, which is good. But there is another to refer to ones grandchild as ones child when it isn't, especially without your consent and knowledge. \n\nThey are helping you out and you are paying your stepmom to care for your child until she can go to the daycare you work at. But that doesn't mean she can hog your daughter from you when you come home and want to hold your baby. She is TA for this and needs to stop right now.\n\nWhen your daughter can be at the daycare, try to find somewhere else to stay so this scenario is put to an end.

Withholding your child from you is especially scary, and your dad referring to your daughter as your stepmom's is also a cause for concern. I would be worried that they might try to use the police/legal system to take your daughter away from you, especially since your stepmom is already espousing concerns about you caring for your own daughter and implying that you're incapable or incompetent. Given all this together, I'd be seriously concerned about their motives. NTA.", "YOU ARE NTA!!  You are kicking ass for having a baby at 20 and ON TOP of that seem to have a fantastic plan to take of you two!  I would also have a hard time hearing them call her their child and I\u2019m guessing you might even have a bit of guilt for not being with her all day. Women who have children and who want a career are fucked and held to some weird standard about not being able to do both.  Absolutely let them know that you aren\u2019t ok with them referring to your daughter that and be as respectful as you can :)\n\nPS - don\u2019t rule out schooling in the future. It took me awhile to realize I was excited about learning new skills later in life :).", "NTA but I would start looking for a new place to live and childcare ASAP. Do not let them withhold you from picking up your child.", "Beware that they may be planning to take custody of your child.", "NTA for being upset, it is inappropriate for your stepmom to deny you doing anything (safe) with your child. You are her mom!\n\nA but TA for your response to that particular comment - grouping a child in with their \u201clittle babies\u201d is not the same as claiming your child as theirs.", "NAH potentially NTA-\n\nIt\u2019s important that boundaries be clear with all of you, as well as relationship roles. \n\nYou are all supporting each other and working like a family unit- and considering your history with your dad- it totally makes sense why it would push your buttons to watch him take an active parenting role with your brothers and daughter. He\u2019s giving them what he should have been giving you. \n\nAnd it is true: if they are spending their time caring for their granddaughter along with their sons, she is just going to feel like one of the kids they love.\n\nHowever, what is troubling is not letting you hold or feed your daughter, trying to extend this situation- And without context- accusing you of manipulating them. \n\nI would 100% make sure to start your child in that nursery when you do. I would also see if you can reach out to a counselor or social worker and see what you can do to start documenting this situation- so that if the worst happens and your parents try to get custody. You will want someone on your side to help you put things together to say: \u201cOP worked full time, was an active participant in the household and payed for childcare. She was not a negligent parent.\u201d If you need help finding these resources- try calling women\u2019s shelters and organizations. You are obviously not in a DV situation: but these folks are often plugged into resources that can help. \n\nAlso- when things cool off, explain to your step-mom that it is absolutely not okay for her to refuse to let you hold or feed your daughter. And the more upset she gets: the calmer and clearer you get. Do not give her any excuse ever to paint you out to be a danger to your kid. \n\nSecretly record conversations  and keep records if you find her twisting things. They may not be legal where you live- but they may also help you get the help you need. \n\nBut hopefully, none of it will come to this and you all can work this out as a family.", "NTA?\nI honestly don\u2019t think you\u2019re in the wrong nor the right, same with your parents. I hope you show them your appreciation for taking care of your child (even though she\u2019s paid, but still). Now i think \u201clittle babies\u201d might be miscommunication from their side, and they don\u2019t see how you think this is wrong. Can\u2019t say ESH as your parents seem supportive and nice to you, don\u2019t push them away!", "I think NAH personally. You all could likely do with a good sit down communication to talk about how you feel. It is understandable that they have a close bond with your baby since they spend so much time together. It is also understandable that as a new mother with a lot of time away from home that you would have complicated feelings about that, particularly given your past with your father.", "NAH- You are 8 month\u2019s postpartum, and are in a time consuming apprenticeship. You also do chores and cook. You are tired!\n\nYour parents are taking on the bulk of the childcare so of course they\u2019re going to bond with your daughter. Step Mom has a baby 2 months older so I get it\u2019s like they\u2019re currently being raised like siblings.\n\nHer not allowing you to hold you baby is a bit much, end of the day you are her mother. \n\n Calling both babies their babies is speaking in generalities and nothing to be upset by, especially when they were talking to someone who knows they\u2019re the grandparents.\n\nSide note: I am terrible at math, I\u2019m talking about could hardly pass easy HS math terrible. In college I was so scared to take a math class. I went to my professors office hours got help from him, also explained it was the only math class I had to pass to transfer to a Uni, and made sure to turn in all my work and I passed!! \n\nI graduated from Uni many years ago, and have a very successful career. My point is don\u2019t let fear stop you from going to college. If I can pass a math class I have full faith that you can too!!", "NTA but it is also not a big deal as you moved in with them and rely on them to help raise your child. \n\nYou are also picking a very low paying profession, which is not a bad thing, but you may require their help in the future too.", "NAH.\n\nYour dad might have been a little insensitive, but it sounds like he's speaking from genuine affection for his granddaughter. You might have been a little over sensitive, but not in any sort of asshole-ish way, you're under a lot of stress.  \n\nSounds like you're setting yourself up on a good path in the not-too-distant future. Keep it up, you'll do very well when you have a bit more independence and space alone with your daughter.", "I don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s the asshole here to be honest. You\u2019re trying your best but you need to appreciate everything your dad and stepmom do for you while taking care of your kid. Your dad putting pressure on you for uni can seem like a nightmare but don\u2019t put yourself down, you may be able to if you just put more into it. Your stepmom does seem a bit OTT by not letting you hold your baby, how does she think you managed before you moved in. Try and make a statement by spending as much time as possible with baby in front of her, and if she asks to have her just say \u201cNo we\u2019re having mummy daughter time now\u201d to really press in the point that she\u2019s your baby and not stepmums. Tbh i think it\u2019s just a lot of people with good intentions being over the top.", "I think NAH\n\nYour daughter can never have too many people in her life that will truly love & care for her. Until you have the opportunity to get out on your own I think you will need to accept your dad & step-mother\u2019s help & appreciate that your daughter is being cared for so you can make a future for the both of you. This is not a competition for your daughter. You already won. You\u2019re her mother.\n\nedit correction", "Soft YTA because I understand your pov but when someone says \u201cmy little babies\u201d it doesn\u2019t mean that they are claiming that it is their child.

Sometimes I\u2019ll say \u201clook at my little baby/babies\u201d but I don\u2019t mean it as that\u2019s my child.", "I might be in the minority, but I think YTA.\n\nNot by much though, seems like you have a lot going on, and are frustrated by not being able to spend enough time with your baby. I would not care if my parents called my son their baby. I would be happy they love him enough to say that. The step mother not letting you hold or feed your baby is a bit shitty though.", "YTA imo and overreacting. Would you prefer your father and step mom to not love your baby? Of course they have bonded. You are all living together and they are taking care of your child everyday. It\u2019s just a small slip in their language. I don\u2019t believe your dad has some hidden agenda for suggesting university. Like every parent, he wants you to succeed in life. Going to university will allow you to build a better life for you and your child. I think you are just frustrated that you can\u2019t spend enough time with your daughter. But that\u2019s no reason to lash out at your parents.", "Light YTA I do think you\u2019re overreacting. This isn\u2019t a big deal.", "Yeah, light YTA.\n\nYou moved in for assistance and are getting childcare and help with the baby.

Or is there anyone else you can stay with - even just briefly, until your daughter starts daycare?", "If OP has proof that she pays them to babysit I can't imagine a custody case would get far unless they had proof she was unfit.", "since op is paying for childcare they wouldn\u2019t really have a case here", "WTF? I assume you were intending to be encouraging rather than delusional, but OP made every possible choice for a life of isolation and poverty. The one good break she has (a parent and stepparent who are caring and supporting her and her baby) is what she came here to *complain* about. In what country can an unmarried woman who blew off even basic schooling and whose only marketable skill is childcare even afford to live by herself in a decent place, let alone raise a child? Much of the world lives that way, but would you really applaud if *your* daughter made those choices? It's probably a mercy that she doesn't realize how bad a hand she is playing. She is going to be dependent on her father at least as long as her child is growing up.\n\nThe redditors outraged about her stepmother \"not letting her hold her baby\" clearly haven't raised children. All she has to do is be there the next time the diaper needs to be changed and *no one* will stand in her way.", "Great points. Agree with this.", "[removed]", "She mentioned she would soon be able to have the kid at a nursery she works at, such a perfect job and she can still be around her child while working and get it out of the house", "Full on 100% agree, even becoming a parent doesn't make you a real parent. Look at OP baby daddy, he is a parent but in name only. OP is doing her best and from the sounds of it, she is doing good, especially for her age and essential on her own, she doesn't have a co-parent, and stepmom is being paid to babysit.", "Excellent summary. NTA", "# OP THIS", "Please if you read any of this OP, focus on this comment^^^^^^ my friend is dealing with a psycho mother wanting to steal her kids because my friend went NC, but thankfully we're in a state where grandparent rights don't exist.", "Yep, I agree! Shocking and disgusting.", "> however in two months my daughter will be able to start the nursery I work in.\n\nYes, very suspicious that her dad wants her to go to college, which means they'll have the child all day instead of her caring for her own child at the nursery.", "Stranger things have happened. I've heard very similar stories where family members are \"concerned\" about a young mom's \"suitability\" and they could bring up things like \"OP never holds/feeds her child, even when she's home.\"", "She didn\u2019t blow off basic schooling, she has an apprenticeship and is working her way towards a career. Childcare may not be the most lucrative profession but it\u2019s an in-demand skill and it sounds like she will be able to work with/near her kid and probably get her childcare costs subsidized. OP may not be in the best situation right now but she\u2019s got a plan and she\u2019s working hard to achieve her goals, which is pretty good for a 20yo.", "New Zealand, Australia. Most countries outside of the US really. We value people who want to raise their own children, have a career plan, pay for childcare and rent. OP has her head screwed on. \n\nShe isnt dependent on anyone. She is paying her family for food, board and childcare of HER child.", "they are wrong but it hardly sounds like they are using her.. they aren\u2019t gaining anything", "Try working in childcare and it could mean you can put you baby in it for a reduced price.", "You can't post your email address publicly like this.", "NTA Don't apologize, start setting some very firm boundaries because they are currently manipulating you.", "They\u2019re gaining money.", "Then the 19 year old should\u2019ve made sure she didn\u2019t get pregnant.
