I (M35) am married to my wife (30F). My wife has a few medical issues that I'm not going to list here for privacy. But she does have a service dog that is trained to do tasks to help mitigate these issues. Her dog is five and he has been with us for three years. He is a huge help to her and helps her maintain her independence. \n\nMy sister, BIL, and their son, (3) live close to us and we see them often enough. However, my nephew has recently developed a fascination with dogs.  He constantly talks about them and my sister has apparently had some issues with him constantly trying to run up to people with dogs. \n\nThis has extended towards my wife's dog. Obviously when my wife goes out, the dog comes with her so he can alert her for any health issues. So we've gone over to their house or met them at a park, and my nephew will not leave the dog alone. He constantly gets in his face, tries to pet him, speaks to him, the works. This has been upsetting for my wife, because even though the dog is obviously well trained, these incidents have been significantly distracting and she is worried about him becoming off task. \n\nNow, I don't want to make it seem like my Sister and BIL aren't doing anything. They've really been trying to keep him away and they are trying to improve his behavior towards dogs in general. But he is three and has the impulse control of well, a three year old.\n\nAfter our last visit, my wife and I talked. She was very upset about how much our nephew was pestering her dog. She is afraid it could distract him and cause him to miss an alert or task, or that it could undo some (very expensive) training. She also knows that he's young and can't really help it. After some discussion, we both agreed we wouldn't be visiting our nephew until he was older and has more control of himself. \n\nI talked to my sister and while she was very upset, she did understand. She gets how dangerous the situation is and let us know they really are trying. But they will definitely miss our visits since we are all fairly close. \n\nI thought it was a done deal until my mom called and laid into me about cutting my nephew off. She said he was a kid and couldn't help it. I told her I was aware that he couldn't help it but it was dangerous for my wife. She argued with me but told me I was being rude and was definitely in the wrong.

The people who are closest to the situation and know what's involved all agree that it's for the best.\n\nMeanwhile, can't you get together with your sister and BIL without their son? Babysitters exist. Let your mother watch the kid if she's so concerned about his family interactions.", "NTA\n\nYour mom needs to keep her nose out of you and your sister's business.  This is between the two of you and you're both adults.\n\n\"he didn't really agree with our decision.\"\n\nOK.  Is he going to pay to retrain your dog when the kid ruins the dog's training?  No? Friend can get stuffed.", "NTA- service dogs are not cute little pets for people to fawn over. They have a job to do and can\u2019t do it if they\u2019re being distracted. My kids have been taught since they were toddlers that No, we dont pet or talk to the service dogs because they are working. If your nephew can\u2019t leave the dog alone, the only choice you have is to stay away from him.", "NTA\n\nEveryone had handled this so well until your mom decided to meddle.", "NTA.\n\nI was going to go with N-A-H until your mom decided to chime in - suggesting that your wife's well-being is less important than some minor disappointment for your nephew is strictly the realm of an AH.\n\nOf course, it isn't all-or-nothing, you can still visit without your wife there, though obviously that would be much less often.", "NTA, you are right. It's not like your wife is upset about a pet dog being okayed with. It's a working animal and they need to work. Your nephew is young, yes, that's why instead of lecturing / punishing him, you decided to take some distance.\nAaaanyway, this is a life and death issue we are talking about, so NTA", "NTA. \n\nBut, I think you can make it work, with training. Young kids are relentless when they want something. So work must go in to teaching the young kid how to treat dogs, and service dogs in particular. The kids parents need to do this work. And you guys have to be understanding, which it sounds like you are trying to be, but ultimately you need to put yourselves first. \n\nBut kids can learn these things when they are taught effectively. It might not work the first or second time, but if all parties are willing to make it work, then there's only one way forward.", "NTA. Your sister has tried and is unable to control the behavior at the current time.  The dog should not be subjected to that, and therefore should not be around your nephew, until he is old enough to leave the dog alone.", "NTA \n\nThe A\u2019s are your SIL and BIL.

If he were running around pulling out the tubes from an oxygen tank, they\u2019d also be the A\u2019s. Running around interfering with her medical alert service dog is no different. \n\nConsider coming up with an alternative approach for visits, like over a fence, or via Zoom.", "NTA, this includes your sister.

When you visit, meet with one adult at a time while the other keeps the nephew occupied in another room or the back yard or somewhere.  Then switch.  Then have the kid come in for a few minutes at the end when you are ready to go.  And have his parents hold him, at three this should still be possible.  And if he acts up or touches the dog, say goodbye, give him a hug and leave.", "What?  Your mom and your friend don't understand that the dog is her safety net and the nephew (understandably) can't control himself around this dog?  Yeesh, your mom and friend are SOOOOO wrong.

Of course it's hard for the 3 year old to understand but you wouldn't let him play with asthma spray or an epipen, so you shouldn't let him play with a service dog.", "It's easy for people with no skin in the game to judge you and your wife for risks you aren't willing to take. I'd just tell them that.\n\n\"It isn't your health or safety being compromised, you aren't a doctor and you aren't a dog trainer. So while you are certainly entitled to form whatever uninformed opinions you choose, my choices are very very informed and they are being used to mitigate significant health risks. Your position is one that necessarily undermines everything that we are working towards. So now I'm going to force you to make a choice- either you can let go of your uninformed opinions and respect our boundaries or you understand that we will enforce them as need be. Be very clear- this isn't a negotiation. You are challenging the protections we have been advised to put into place for health and safety purposes and you will lose.", "NTA and if your sister and BIL are good parents he'll outgrow this. The people trying to downplay the situation and minimize the risk to your wife are definitely assholes though.", "NTA. You must protect the dog's training, or it will get dangerously confused.\n\nThe boy's parents are the problem, because, despite what you say, they are not trying to keep the kid off the dog. You can do that with a three-year-old very easily simply by holding the kid (lovingly, of course) so that he can't pester the animal. He's little; they're big. They can stop him. Yes, he'll wriggle and whine. But that's their problem. Why is it yours?\n\nAlso, sister and BIL could explain to their child in very certain terms that HE HAS TO LEAVE THE DOG ALONE. Yes, a three-year-old is slow to understand things, but he is not utterly oblivious, permanently forgetful. It CAN be done; they just aren't doing it.\n\nWorst of all is the usual Reddit mother, opening her fecking mouth about your decision, which does not concern her. I would have read her the riot act.\n\nAnd do I infer correctly that either sister or BIL ran tattling to your mother, thus creating her attempt to interfere? Maybe I'm wrong about that, but if not, it suggests that sister and BIL are sabotaging your efforts to protect your dog.\n\nWhich confirms my theory that they are the problem here, reacting in secret anger against your proactive stance.", "If he can\u2019t control himself around the dog then the next best solution is simply to remove him from the situation completely.

Took years before he saw her again", "NTA. Your mother clearly needs to butt out. There\u2019s no reason to think this behavior won\u2019t improve with the passage of time. But also, given the way this has affected you emotionally and the fact that it\u2019s made it to the point where you won\u2019t even see your nephew alone, I really hope you\u2019re able to get past this and it doesn\u2019t cause a permanent rift with your nephew who is, after all, only 3.", "My sister and I did talk about that. My nephew is going through a bit of a separation anxiety phase so it's hard for them to get away, but they are also working on it and we are hoping to be able to get dinner soon.", "I think both my mom and my friend don't really get the whole \"service dog thing\" if I'm being totally honest.", "NTA - Plus pay for any medical bills if the dog misses something while being distracted.", "Honestly we've kind of exhausted our end of things and have tried multiple times to make things work and he just will not listen at this time. So I'm not willing to put my wife and dog in the line of that much stress anymore right now.", "I'm hoping to get together with my sister and her husband sans kiddo soon. Honestly while I'm not blaming the toddler for being a toddler, I am also a little frustrated by the turn of events and also want a bit of a break too.", "We talked about that but we decided it was better to just stay away completely.

My nephew has been going through a bit of a separation anxiety stage right now as well (that they are also working on) but it's still hard for her to step away. But hopefully we can have lunch with her soon.", "We're talking about a service dog. They get plenty of time to goof off and act like a regular dog but once the harness is on, they're on duty and shouldn't be distracted. There's a reason service dog vest tell you not to pet them.", "I'm not really going to judge my sister's parenting, not being a parent myself. It seems like they are trying, but maybe just aren't doing the right approach. I have seen them explain that he has to leave the dog alone and he completely ignores them. \n\nOn my mom's side, she does tend to blow things out of proportion. I'm sure my sister just casually mentioned the situation and she blew up about it. My sister is much closer to my mom than myself.", "I just hope that this is their signal to kick their parenting into high gear. It's upsetting and dangerous for us, but I also really shudder to think about what would happen if he was allowed to run up to the wrong dog.", "Thank you. I'm sure it won't cause a permanent riff. I'll be the first to admit that I have very little understanding about little kids and despite my love for my nephew, I don't have endless patience for them, which I'm sure if factoring into the decision. There's also just the sympathy and emotion I have for my wife, who really doesn't need any more headaches.", "Most likely.  You can spend the time explaining it to them, but stick to your guns and agreement with your sister.  There is nothing preventing just YOU from visiting your sister and nephew from time to time, though.  You don't have to cut him off completely.", "That's fair mate. You are the best judge of that, and I don't know all the nuances. \n\nBut ultimately, it comes down to the kids parents. \n\nI don't know if this is of value to you, because I don't know if you have kids or not. But with the kids I know, and my own included, they are demons come late afternoon. Any sense of emotional regulation they have goes out the window. \n\nWhen I have to teach my 3 year old things, I do it in the mornings. Because by afternoon they are cactus lol. \n\nIf, in the future, you wish to try again, this might be something to consider. But again, the parents need to do the leg work here. \n\nI wish you and your wife the best mate.", "If they have dog owner friends who are willing to help, they might try clicker training your nephew.  Yes, I know, clicker training is primarily marketed at dogs, but it\u2019s tremendously effective with young children, too.  Mini M&Ms make a good reward because each one is only about 1.5 calories (you really do have to be generous with the reward, especially in the beginning, for clicker training to work, so low calorie rewards are a must).  Smarties are another decent option at about 2.5 calories each.\n\nOnce they have him able to be calm and not all over pet dogs, then you can have a conversation about trying to restart visiting.", "Ok.  It is her brother, right?  She can manage that relationship.", "Perhaps you can also meet them at a playground?  This way the nephew can play with other kids while you visit.", "14th Amendment.\n\nBut there should be a 28th amendment abolishing all laws that protect humans and replacing them with the d-ath penalty for anyone who doesn't live dogs", "I've actually decided to put my own visits on hold for a while too.

Funny enough we normally go in the mornings/early afternoon. LoL", "They have a friend with a very tolerant dog they are trying to work with. I have a few friends with dogs but most of  their dogs are not tolerant about kids or strangers for a variety of reasons so I would never ever ask them.", "No it's my sister and her husband.", "We have tried this and it doesn't help. He is so hyper-focused on the dog that he rarely strays away.", "Have they tried clicker training or another R+ training method for the kid?  I very highly recommend that style of training.  It makes learning more exciting/enjoyable for whoever/whatever you\u2019re training, which means they\u2019re more eager to learn and the lessons stick better.", "Well you should visit them alone?", "I am not sure. He isn't my kid and I have zero experience in parenting so I stay out of it.", "I'm actually planning on staying away for a while as well.

Aside from the service dog issue, which it looks like everyone has addressed, this kid and his parents have another huge issue.

There is nothing wrong with a tw.porary solution like this.", "NAH, this is an awfully difficult situation for all involved and there's no-one to blame, it's just one of those shitty situations where you have to make the least bad choice you have, rather than the \"good choice\".\n\nI don't know if any of these would be possible in your situation but a few ideas just popped into my head so I figured I'd share them in case anything helps.\n\nThe \"simplest\" one would be to join up with a local dog walking group that are open to you bringing a service dog. You and your wife could make this something you do with your nephew say, once a week/fortnight/month (however your schedules permit) which will allow him to indulge in his love of dogs while there are plenty of adorable little fuzzballs to keep even the most addicted pup enthusiast busy, without putting more strain on your dog and giving him the opportunity to do what he needs to do, while also getting some socialisation with other dogs and a bit extra exercise. Again, I'm not in any way knowledgeable on how the training for service dogs works so maybe they can't be around other dogs or something - these are literally just ideas off the top of my head so I apologise if they're not feasible, still they may trigger a train of thought which leads to a solution. It doesn't have to be a walking group if your wife's health issues prevent that, there are some cafes which encourage dog owners and dog lovers to come in, have a cuppa and pet some cute pups. That could be an alternative to the walking.\n\nAnother idea, although definitely not one that is very inviting, would be for you to make your visits  solo until he's old enough to comprehend that the dog has a job to do and it is very important that he isn't distracted, because he can save his auntie's life in some rare cases, so he mustn't pet or fuss the dog so he can be alert to help his auntie with anything she needs. Maybe you could incorporate your wife into things by making videos on your phone with your nephew, to send to her - like an \"adventures with uncle and me\" journal. Say for example if you took him to the park and he finds a new playmate he could (with the playmate's parent's permission of course - lol try saying that 10 times fast! \ud83d\ude02) introduce them to thee camera, explain how they met and what made them such good friends. Or on one visit you could take one of those cheap \"bug hunting\" sets you can get that come with a few little pots with air holes, a magnifying glass and you can show auntie your bug hunt adventure, how you set up the pots with leaves/twigs to make the bug feel safe, how you examine them with a magnifier and maybe even start a nature journal where he can try to draw the bug he caught and give them a name (when he's a little older you can get more science-y but at 3 patience is an unknown word \ud83d\ude02) once you're done you can emphasise how important it is to put them back exactly where you found them and wash hands and equipment thoroughly (we did similar with my nephew at 3ish and tbh even now, at 8 - 9 in December - woah, where did that go?! \ud83d\ude02, even now I think the washing up parts would still be an \"Auntie Sarah job\" \ud83d\ude02)\nThe adventures don't have to be huge or massively expensive at that age either, more often than not it's a waste if they are because they have the attention span of a soggy teabag \ud83d\ude02 - you can do \"art club\" with cheap pound shop poster paints, a \"jungle adventure\" to the garden centre to help uncle choose a beautiful plant for auntie, see if there's a local football/sports club which does taster sessions for youngsters - tons of stuff for free or very little cost that will occupy you for an hour or two, add in a cake at a tea shop or a treat burger lunch at Maccy D's or just have a \"picnic\" by eating your lunch sitting on a blanket in the garden or front room if weather hampers. Your wife could do little videos back if she wanted to, either showing her and the dog out on their own adventures, running errands or just her reacting to his videos. It's not as good as being together in person but technology can help for the year or so it will take for him to be able to understand the difference between a regular pet dog and a service dog properly.\n\nLastly, have you spoken to your sister about getting a family pet? It doesn't have to be as labour intense as a dog, just something to take the focus away from random dogs to \"his\" own pet. It could be something small and easily manageable, like a hamster, or leopard gecko - make sure they do their research for animals that are a bit hardier as 3yr olds can underestimate their own strength at times. I would suggest fish but tbh my nephew (and myself, my sister and everyone else I know who had a goldfish as a kid) got easily, not bored exactly, but disinterested in caring for them/helping clean their tank etc much quicker than with animals that you can hold and interact with. If there are no phobics in the family there are actually some fantastic snakes which make great first pets as they're handleable, friendly (if treated correctly) only eat a couple of times a week to once a fortnight depending on the type of snake (although their diet is frozen/thawed mice for the most part which a lot of people don't like, which is where lizards/geckos can be preferable as they eat mainly veggies, fruit and insects - again, depending on the species.)\nIt doesn't have to be anything exotic or big but if the whole family likes dogs and they can afford the time and money the dog would require then it may help calm your nephew enough to make visits possible again if your nephew has \"one of his own\" to fuss over instead of your wife's.\n\nAnyway, I apologise for the insanely long response. I do hope some of it helps in any small way it can. I wouldn't want to have to make that choice to stop seeing him but it's your wife's health. Hopefully it will be only a year or two before he can understand a bit better and you can all go back to normal and start rebuilding your relationships with sister, BIL and the little man. When it gets too much try to remind yourselves and that it's a hiatus, not an end. He'll understand soon enough and it's nobody's fault, just a shitty bit of luck sticking you right between a rock and a hard place and you had to pick the \"least bad\" of two equally crappy options. A TEMPORARY break from visiting your nephew is better than some of the terrible things that could happen if the dog fails to notice something he is meant to alert for or fails his job in some way, however small, because he's distracted. If your sister can understand that, despite how painful it is for all of you and every one of her instincts wanting to make her baby safe and happy and let him pet all of the dogs, then your mum has no right to get involved. I would double check with your sister before speaking to mum though, whether these thoughts came from your mum, or from her. She may have been upset and just venting at your mum and your mum's taken that as her being really angry and upset and not understanding why you had to make the choice you made and decided to play referee. It could be your mum's opinion that you were the A, in which case that's disappointing but also understandable in a way - nobody *wants* to make that decision. Someone *had* to make it. It sucks whichever way the cookie crumbles. Hopefully mum will calm down and realise that you had no choice soon enough. However, you do need to establish who's opinion it is your mum gave before speaking to her about it.\n\nBest of luck to you all xxx", "NTA.
