I (M35) am married to my wife (30F). My wife has a few medical issues that I'm not going to list here for privacy. But she does have a service dog that is trained to do tasks to help mitigate these issues. Her dog is five and he has been with us for three years. He is a huge help to her and helps her maintain her independence. \n\nMy sister, BIL, and their son, (3) live close to us and we see them often enough. However, my nephew has recently developed a fascination with dogs.  He constantly talks about them and my sister has apparently had some issues with him constantly trying to run up to people with dogs. \n\nThis has extended towards my wife's dog. Obviously when my wife goes out, the dog comes with her so he can alert her for any health issues. So we've gone over to their house or met them at a park, and my nephew will not leave the dog alone. He constantly gets in his face, tries to pet him, speaks to him, the works. This has been upsetting for my wife, because even though the dog is obviously well trained, these incidents have been significantly distracting and she is worried about him becoming off task. \n\nNow, I don't want to make it seem like my Sister and BIL aren't doing anything. They've really been trying to keep him away and they are trying to improve his behavior towards dogs in general. But he is three and has the impulse control of well, a three year old.\n\nAfter our last visit, my wife and I talked. She was very upset about how much our nephew was pestering her dog. She is afraid it could distract him and cause him to miss an alert or task, or that it could undo some (very expensive) training. She also knows that he's young and can't really help it. After some discussion, we both agreed we wouldn't be visiting our nephew until he was older and has more control of himself. \n\nI talked to my sister and while she was very upset, she did understand. She gets how dangerous the situation is and let us know they really are trying. But they will definitely miss our visits since we are all fairly close. \n\nI thought it was a done deal until my mom called and laid into me about cutting my nephew off. She said he was a kid and couldn't help it. I told her I was aware that he couldn't help it but it was dangerous for my wife. She argued with me but told me I was being rude and was definitely in the wrong. I was also kind of venting about the situation to a friend and he also said he didn't really agree with our decision.", "created_utc": 1693917853, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16an931/aita_for_not_visiting_my_nephew_since_he_wont/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like your sister was rightfully quite disappointed but understood your reasons. Your mom? That's a whole different matter. How are you cutting your nephew off? From what? It makes no sense. You can still see him, it's just that you won't have your wife and her service animal there too.", "NTA. The only people involved in this decision are you, your wife, and your sister and BIL, and everyone is on the same page about it. Not your mother's business, not your friend's business. The people who are closest to the situation and know what's involved all agree that it's for the best.\n\nMeanwhile, can't you get together with your sister and BIL without their son? Babysitters exist. Let your mother watch the kid if she's so concerned about his family interactions.", "NTA\n\nYour mom needs to keep her nose out of you and your sister's business.  This is between the two of you and you're both adults.\n\n\"he didn't really agree with our decision.\"\n\nOK.  Is he going to pay to retrain your dog when the kid ruins the dog's training?  No? Friend can get stuffed.", "NTA- service dogs are not cute little pets for people to fawn over. They have a job to do and can\u2019t do it if they\u2019re being distracted. My kids have been taught since they were toddlers that No, we dont pet or talk to the service dogs because they are working. If your nephew can\u2019t leave the dog alone, the only choice you have is to stay away from him.", "NTA\n\nEveryone had handled this so well until your mom decided to meddle.", "NTA.\n\nI was going to go with N-A-H until your mom decided to chime in - suggesting that your wife's well-being is less important than some minor disappointment for your nephew is strictly the realm of an AH.\n\nOf course, it isn't all-or-nothing, you can still visit without your wife there, though obviously that would be much less often.", "NTA, you are right. It's not like your wife is upset about a pet dog being okayed with. It's a working animal and they need to work. Your nephew is young, yes, that's why instead of lecturing / punishing him, you decided to take some distance.\nAaaanyway, this is a life and death issue we are talking about, so NTA", "NTA. \n\nBut, I think you can make it work, with training. Young kids are relentless when they want something. So work must go in to teaching the young kid how to treat dogs, and service dogs in particular. The kids parents need to do this work. And you guys have to be understanding, which it sounds like you are trying to be, but ultimately you need to put yourselves first. \n\nBut kids can learn these things when they are taught effectively. It might not work the first or second time, but if all parties are willing to make it work, then there's only one way forward.", "NTA. Your sister has tried and is unable to control the behavior at the current time.  The dog should not be subjected to that, and therefore should not be around your nephew, until he is old enough to leave the dog alone.", "NTA \n\nThe A\u2019s are your SIL and BIL. Whatever they\u2019re doing clearly isn\u2019t enough, and they\u2019re letting their child interfere with your wife\u2019s lifesaving medical equipment. If he were running around pulling out the tubes from an oxygen tank, they\u2019d also be the A\u2019s. Running around interfering with her medical alert service dog is no different. \n\nConsider coming up with an alternative approach for visits, like over a fence, or via Zoom.", "NTA, this includes your sister. Your wife needs to have her service dog focused on his job, which is her health. Your sister understood your reasoning and handled it well. I\u2019m sure she is disappointed and it\u2019s okay to be. But your mom is being unreasonable.", "NTA, but I\u2019m sure you can visit your sister, who you are very close to, by yourself, right?", "NTA, you don't have a regular dog, so people and kids need to leave it alone.", "NAH, with the possible exception of your mother for being insensitive.  You're not being rude; you're doing what you have to, to maintain your wife's safety.  Your wife needing to travel with a service dog is no different than a diabetic requiring insulin.  It's simply not something that can be optional.\n\nPerhaps you could visit your nephew solo.", "NTA for protecting your wife but I think there is an easier answer.  When you visit, meet with one adult at a time while the other keeps the nephew occupied in another room or the back yard or somewhere.  Then switch.  Then have the kid come in for a few minutes at the end when you are ready to go.  And have his parents hold him, at three this should still be possible.  And if he acts up or touches the dog, say goodbye, give him a hug and leave.", "What?  Your mom and your friend don't understand that the dog is her safety net and the nephew (understandably) can't control himself around this dog?  Yeesh, your mom and friend are SOOOOO wrong.  Is there a way for your sister to come visit every once in a while?", "YTA\n\nThe dog isn't your slave and if it wants to play it should be able to do so\n\nDog wants > human needs", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Of course it's hard for the 3 year old to understand but you wouldn't let him play with asthma spray or an epipen, so you shouldn't let him play with a service dog.", "It's easy for people with no skin in the game to judge you and your wife for risks you aren't willing to take. I'd just tell them that.\n\n\"It isn't your health or safety being compromised, you aren't a doctor and you aren't a dog trainer. So while you are certainly entitled to form whatever uninformed opinions you choose, my choices are very very informed and they are being used to mitigate significant health risks. Your position is one that necessarily undermines everything that we are working towards. So now I'm going to force you to make a choice- either you can let go of your uninformed opinions and respect our boundaries or you understand that we will enforce them as need be. Be very clear- this isn't a negotiation. You are challenging the protections we have been advised to put into place for health and safety purposes and you will lose.", "NTA and if your sister and BIL are good parents he'll outgrow this. The people trying to downplay the situation and minimize the risk to your wife are definitely assholes though.", "NTA. You must protect the dog's training, or it will get dangerously confused.\n\nThe boy's parents are the problem, because, despite what you say, they are not trying to keep the kid off the dog. You can do that with a three-year-old very easily simply by holding the kid (lovingly, of course) so that he can't pester the animal. He's little; they're big. They can stop him. Yes, he'll wriggle and whine. But that's their problem. Why is it yours?\n\nAlso, sister and BIL could explain to their child in very certain terms that HE HAS TO LEAVE THE DOG ALONE. Yes, a three-year-old is slow to understand things, but he is not utterly oblivious, permanently forgetful. It CAN be done; they just aren't doing it.\n\nWorst of all is the usual Reddit mother, opening her fecking mouth about your decision, which does not concern her. I would have read her the riot act.\n\nAnd do I infer correctly that either sister or BIL ran tattling to your mother, thus creating her attempt to interfere? Maybe I'm wrong about that, but if not, it suggests that sister and BIL are sabotaging your efforts to protect your dog.\n\nWhich confirms my theory that they are the problem here, reacting in secret anger against your proactive stance.", "If he can\u2019t control himself around the dog then the next best solution is simply to remove him from the situation completely. NTA. Yeah it sucks, but I had a cousin that chased my dog around the house even though we kept trying to stop him as a toddler and eventually she had enough after he cornered her. Took years before he saw her again", "NTA. Your mother clearly needs to butt out. There\u2019s no reason to think this behavior won\u2019t improve with the passage of time. But also, given the way this has affected you emotionally and the fact that it\u2019s made it to the point where you won\u2019t even see your nephew alone, I really hope you\u2019re able to get past this and it doesn\u2019t cause a permanent rift with your nephew who is, after all, only 3.", "My sister and I did talk about that. My nephew is going through a bit of a separation anxiety phase so it's hard for them to get away, but they are also working on it and we are hoping to be able to get dinner soon.", "I think both my mom and my friend don't really get the whole \"service dog thing\" if I'm being totally honest.", "NTA - Plus pay for any medical bills if the dog misses something while being distracted.", "Honestly we've kind of exhausted our end of things and have tried multiple times to make things work and he just will not listen at this time. So I'm not willing to put my wife and dog in the line of that much stress anymore right now.", "I'm hoping to get together with my sister and her husband sans kiddo soon. Honestly while I'm not blaming the toddler for being a toddler, I am also a little frustrated by the turn of events and also want a bit of a break too.", "We talked about that but we decided it was better to just stay away completely. The whole situation has caused my wife a lot of stress and she has admitted that she just gets really worked up even going over there because of how he is acting at the moment.", "I'm hoping my sister can come visit. My nephew has been going through a bit of a separation anxiety stage right now as well (that they are also working on) but it's still hard for her to step away. But hopefully we can have lunch with her soon.", "We're talking about a service dog. They get plenty of time to goof off and act like a regular dog but once the harness is on, they're on duty and shouldn't be distracted. There's a reason service dog vest tell you not to pet them.", "I'm not really going to judge my sister's parenting, not being a parent myself. It seems like they are trying, but maybe just aren't doing the right approach. I have seen them explain that he has to leave the dog alone and he completely ignores them. \n\nOn my mom's side, she does tend to blow things out of proportion. I'm sure my sister just casually mentioned the situation and she blew up about it. My sister is much closer to my mom than myself.", "I just hope that this is their signal to kick their parenting into high gear. It's upsetting and dangerous for us, but I also really shudder to think about what would happen if he was allowed to run up to the wrong dog.", "Thank you. I'm sure it won't cause a permanent riff. I'll be the first to admit that I have very little understanding about little kids and despite my love for my nephew, I don't have endless patience for them, which I'm sure if factoring into the decision. There's also just the sympathy and emotion I have for my wife, who really doesn't need any more headaches.", "Most likely.  You can spend the time explaining it to them, but stick to your guns and agreement with your sister.  There is nothing preventing just YOU from visiting your sister and nephew from time to time, though.  You don't have to cut him off completely.", "That's fair mate. You are the best judge of that, and I don't know all the nuances. \n\nBut ultimately, it comes down to the kids parents. \n\nI don't know if this is of value to you, because I don't know if you have kids or not. But with the kids I know, and my own included, they are demons come late afternoon. Any sense of emotional regulation they have goes out the window. \n\nWhen I have to teach my 3 year old things, I do it in the mornings. Because by afternoon they are cactus lol. \n\nIf, in the future, you wish to try again, this might be something to consider. But again, the parents need to do the leg work here. \n\nI wish you and your wife the best mate.", "If they have dog owner friends who are willing to help, they might try clicker training your nephew.  Yes, I know, clicker training is primarily marketed at dogs, but it\u2019s tremendously effective with young children, too.  Mini M&Ms make a good reward because each one is only about 1.5 calories (you really do have to be generous with the reward, especially in the beginning, for clicker training to work, so low calorie rewards are a must).  Smarties are another decent option at about 2.5 calories each.\n\nOnce they have him able to be calm and not all over pet dogs, then you can have a conversation about trying to restart visiting.", "Ok.  It is her brother, right?  She can manage that relationship.", "Perhaps you can also meet them at a playground?  This way the nephew can play with other kids while you visit.", "14th Amendment.\n\nBut there should be a 28th amendment abolishing all laws that protect humans and replacing them with the d-ath penalty for anyone who doesn't live dogs", "I've actually decided to put my own visits on hold for a while too. While rationally I know this isn't anyone's fault, I'm a little upset about the situation myself. I don't hold my nephew at fault for anything, but emotionally I guess it's just been a little much for me.", "Thank you. That is very kind. Funny enough we normally go in the mornings/early afternoon. LoL", "They have a friend with a very tolerant dog they are trying to work with. I have a few friends with dogs but most of  their dogs are not tolerant about kids or strangers for a variety of reasons so I would never ever ask them.", "No it's my sister and her husband.", "We have tried this and it doesn't help. He is so hyper-focused on the dog that he rarely strays away.", "Have they tried clicker training or another R+ training method for the kid?  I very highly recommend that style of training.  It makes learning more exciting/enjoyable for whoever/whatever you\u2019re training, which means they\u2019re more eager to learn and the lessons stick better.", "Well you should visit them alone?", "I am not sure. He isn't my kid and I have zero experience in parenting so I stay out of it.", "I'm actually planning on staying away for a while as well. I know it isn't rational but I'm just a little upset about the whole situation because it could have caused my wife and her dog a lot of harm.", "Do what you need to do for your mental health.  But don't hold being a toddler against a toddler.  The parents should keep them away but the kid isn't weird or at fault for loving dogs.", "Rational me does know that. LoL. I'm not outwardly blaming him. But it's been very frustrating to deal with.", "I am sorry you have to deal with this.  It is a hassle and a threat you don't need."]}
