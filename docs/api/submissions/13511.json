She CAN suck it up and be happy for things you've achieved, everything isnt about her.  And she is going to find out that when the baby arrives because suddenly everyone will be focused on the baby and not her.", "NTA\n\nObviously she's got a lot on her plate and a lot of it is thing she chose to do (have a baby).  Getting into an Ivy League school is a huge deal, it's totally unfair for her to steal the spotlight during something like that, especially by crying like a child.\n\nSeems like your family is enabling her too.", ">I recently got accepted into an Ivy League university\n\nThat's awesome! Congratulations!!\n\nNTA.  Sounds like this is her standard response to grab attention from your parents (and others).  She probably is continually comparing herself to you...I bet that's difficult to get away from because you're twins. She's likely wishing she'd made different choices.\n\nNone of that is your problem though. You could have taken her aside and spoken to her privately though.  You should absolutely address this with your parents as they are being manipulated and you need their attention too.\n\nI don't blame you for being fed up with all of it but at the end of the day, she's your sister and you probably love her. She'll grow up at some point and realize her mistakes. Humbling her in front of family could make that process take longer though.", "NTA \u2013 Sounds like she got a heaping spoonful of Had It Coming, with extra salt.  And what does she mean that she \"didn\u2019t even get accepted into any colleges\" there are thousands of colleges where you don't have to \"get in,\" you simply go register for classes.\n\nIn the future, though, I would recommend the high road, or least some calm sarcasm.  \"Hey, I have some exciting news about making the Dean's List, did you want to have a temper tantrum ready about morning sickness or something?\"", "NTA. She needs a dose of reality and your parents need to stop enabling her self pity.", "NTA, first of all, congratulations! Your sister needs to get over herself, she sounds extremely jealous of you, because she made poor decisions. Go out there be the best that you can be, failure is not an option at this point, because you\u2019ll give her something to get back at you with.", "NTA\n\nCongrats on your academic achievement!\n\nYour sister needs to learn that the world doesn't revolve around her.

She made the choice to have sex, which comes with a risk of pregnancy.", "NTA.\nLife DOESN\u2019T revolve around her, nor her pregnancy.", "NTA frist congratulations, and i think that your parents frist have to understand that her behavior is not ok, and they have to tell your sister to behave and remind her that she decided to keep the baby so she can't act like a victim", "NTA. and congratulations!", "Congratulations, OP! How exciting for you.\n\nI\u2019m sorry your moment got scuppered. You deserve to be celebrated.\n\nNTA. You need to sit down with your parents and spell out that you feel you haven\u2019t been able to announce or celebrate anything since she announced her pregnancy and that you\u2019d like them to intervene so you don\u2019t end up resenting her.

I think your thunder is being stolen here but it might also be true that your sister is scared and needs support and is inappropriately mixing the two together?", "NTA, being a pregnant teen is scary but this is her choice (as I understood from one of your comments) and she shouldn't ruin all your happy moments with her own negative feelings. She can be worried about her future and also happy for you, the two can coexist.", "NTA. You are both experiencing the consequences of your choices and actions. \nHer sucks. Yours are amazing!!!\nCongratulations! You have worked hard and are on your way to great life, keep making the right choices.", "Congratulations on college!! I am really happy for you!!\n\nHopefully where you are going is out of state. That way you can enjoy your parents one on one. Your sister is about to be for awakening.

Now, my sister is incredibly narcissistic. Your parents aren't doing her any favors doting on her, and if they don't get her help now, she is probably going to only get worse as she gets older. If she has been like this since before the pregnancy, i strongly suggest you get therapy if you can, her behavior can be trauma inducing. And know that it will always be about her, no matter what.

At least not consciously anyway. NTA. \n\nTalk to your parents about this? I'd see how the respond and act from there. If they're so wrapped up in her that they can't see where you're coming from then find other people to surround yourself with who will hold you up not push you aside.

Congratulations on getting accepted into an Ivy League!", "She's allowed to have feelings, and express them. That's a right that every person has. That's not even to mention that when someone is pregnant, their emotions are all over the place because of dramatic changes to their hormones, and physical needs. \n\nWhen I was pregnant, I once cried so hard that I had bruises around my eyes, just because my feet swelled up, and I couldn't wear my favourite flats, and I could tell you a hundred more stories just like it from every single person I've ever known, who had ever been pregnant. My best friend's mom once told me a story about her having a full on snot faced, sobbing meltdown in a Dairy Queen, because they had changed over their Blizzard toppings, and discontinued the one that she wanted.\n\nShe's going through an incredibly intense physical, and email change, and that kind of reaction is normal for pretty much every single pregnant person.

But please tell me that university is far away so you don't have to deal with them too terribly much.", "NTA The way you said it may have been harsh but its true, she's trying to act like the victim when in reality she chose to have unprotected sex so its the consequences she must face now.", "NTA, & congrats on the school acceptance!!

AHEM many states can\u2019t have abortions anymore. Or surgical or medical miscarriages for that matter. we do not know the sisters circumstances of how or why she\u2019s pregnant and even if she\u2019s a huge narcissist, most teenagers have sex and most of them aren\u2019t doing it perfectly.

It should be no surprise that as an older sibling I would retire earlier. Nope. She got on a Facebook rage. I had old boyfriends from high school calling me about it.", "Honest question here. Let's say their parents are helping sister or something, is just being pregnant a factor to not be accepted to college in the US? Because it sucks. And I would understand she is pissed\n\nWhere I am from if you have the marks and you pay the fees they're 0 interested to discuss your personal situation", "She's jealous and realizing the consequences.   But it's not on you to play along with her tantrums.", "Yes, that is a very good point. BUT she also should know how to practice say sex. Pregnancy is a risk she took by not using a condom & birth control, and she has no right to suck all joy away from her sister because of her choices. Then there are the parents, they're not helping the situation any by constantly pandering to her hysterics.", "No, being pregnant isn't a factor for college acceptance. Community college is also available for pretty much anyone. Some schools have daycares.", "Absolutely. Even if OP didn\u2019t have the super special future that is probably hers because of the significant advantage of an Ivy League education, her sister is faced with a hard future.\n\nif sister thinks she has it tough being pregnant, wait until she is dealing with the reality of parenting while presumably working at a dead end low paying job.\n\nBut that is the consequences for her own poor choices. Unprotected sex and then having some kind of fantasy of having a child instead of thinking about alternatives that wouldn\u2019t have effectively wiped out her future unless she is prepared to completely change,  Maybe she will mature and start dealing with the reality of her choices.  But how does someone not get into any college. I mean community colleges are generally open to people with minimal GPA and many of them are set up with makeup courses to help people who didn\u2019t do well  well in high school", "Exactly, the parents aren\u2019t young or pregnant and should be in complete control of their emotions. It makes sense that the sister is a hormone driven emotional mess at the moment but the parents should have enough clarity to see through it.", ">BUT she also should know how to practice say sex. Pregnancy is a risk she took by not using a condom & birth control\n\nMaybe you should advocate for better sex ed in school then, teen pregnancy is still high compare ro another Western nations", "Well, no shit! Half the problem is parents don't want the kids taught & won't do it themselves. And I'm sorry we live in the age of internet so there's no excuse to claim \"I didn't know\"."]}
