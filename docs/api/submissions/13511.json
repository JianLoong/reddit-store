Congratulations!!\n\nNTA.  Sounds like this is her standard response to grab attention from your parents (and others).  She probably is continually comparing herself to you...I bet that's difficult to get away from because you're twins. She's likely wishing she'd made different choices.\n\nNone of that is your problem though. You could have taken her aside and spoken to her privately though.  You should absolutely address this with your parents as they are being manipulated and you need their attention too.\n\nI don't blame you for being fed up with all of it but at the end of the day, she's your sister and you probably love her.

My best friend's mom once told me a story about her having a full on snot faced, sobbing meltdown in a Dairy Queen, because they had changed over their Blizzard toppings, and discontinued the one that she wanted.\n\nShe's going through an incredibly intense physical, and email change, and that kind of reaction is normal for pretty much every single pregnant person.

That might even be the reason she get so very upset, when her loss of opportunities is highlighted. She DOES seem to be acting like it was something 'inflicted' upon her, rather than something she is responsible for. It's possible she DOESN'T feel she had a choice in it. \n\nI reiterate - we can't know that, and she ABSOLUTELY may well have been a 100% willing participant. All I am saying, is pregnant teenage girls are automatically judged - and assumed to have got themselves into their 'mess'. Yet at least a proportion of those girls, will NOT have freely consented.", "I lived like this. My siblings kept making babies left and right, asking for money, food, and leaving their kids unattended and expecting me to take care of while I'm reviewing for major exams. I'm always the bad guy for saying harsh truth. Most neighbor visit to our home, they left kids, not check on them until I asked them to check on the kids at 10 pm, and they'd still oblige me to be the one to bring them back home, to look bad on the kids.\n\n\nHeck. I hate that I had to take care, while also looking like the bad guy for 'returning' them. They even expect me to prep food for them. I hate it as much as I pity their situation.", "OP explicitly said she **wants** to carry it to term. The person your replying to never said this is the consequence of having sex, just that it's the consequence of deciding to keep the baby, which yes, if she's decided she wants to then it is the consequence of that choice. Your comment would be correct if we were talking generally, but we are not.\n\nOp also mentions that it was her boyfriend, not ex boyfriend, just boyfriend. So it seems he'll have the consequences of raising the child too. What were you thinking you replied to when you wrote this? It's so out of place.", "Condoms + pill(or another 2nd form like depo) have a pretty High success rate when combined and used properly.  \nodds are if they were used OP would know as sister would almost surely have said something like \"how can I be pregnant we used protection\"\n\nTrue though teens do stupid things, but it is 100% not OPs problem/fault sister is pregnant."]}
