Your wife was wrong for hiding from you. While you don't agree with her having an OF period, that should've been a conversation you two had as a couple and she robbed you of that opportunity and proceeded to hide it all together. The fact that she's calling you a pervert but the first message you receive as a sub is her squirting video, I'm baffled. As negative as it is, I can only wonder what else she may have been hiding from you. \n\nIf you both decide to stay in the marriage, counseling is a heavy recommendation. But tbh if it were me I don't know if I could continue being with someone who not only lies and hides things from me but also vilifies me because they got caught doing fuck shit. Good luck OP, I recommend getting a good attorney", "NTA gaslighting and deflection", "Solid NTA. She\u2019s mad because you got an account so you can see *hers*?? This is just weird", "NTA.

DARVO is a manipulation technique used by abusers to avoid taking responsibility for their actions and shift the blame onto their victims, which is what she is doing to you. She was caught red handed as the saying goes so she can't deny what she was doing but she is certainly attacking you and reversing who's the victim and who's the offender. You are NTA and you are certainly not the offender. Your wife is, but I don't think she'll ever admit it or stop blaming you for the crap she was doing. To put it bluntly, your wife is a cheater, a liar, and a manipulator and it doesn't look like she is going to change anytime soon.
