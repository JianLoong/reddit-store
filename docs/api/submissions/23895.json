Some aren't applicable to most boys - for instance, an unexpected period showing through your pants - but there's also accidentally calling your teacher mom, talking shit about somebody without realizing they're right behind you, everybody finding out who your crush is when you don't want it known, etc. \n\nAll of those are things that many people would agree are more embarrassing than an accidental fart.", "I know, right! I wet myself in second grade and had an all day hanging booger. I know embarrassing!", "Are you ok with his friends telling other people and possibly the entire school will bully him for the rest of his high school experience?", "I find it hard to believe the school would bully a kid for sitting on a whoopie cushion. That\u2019s tame shit compared to what\u2019s happening every day at school.", "I dont agree, kids bully other kids for almost nothing.", "If that's the most embarrassing thing to happen to him in his life, then he's had it very good. \n\nNTA", "ESH What your son is doing is rude and his unwillingness to change his behavior is upsetting however I think there are other ways you could have taught him a lesson like doing the same thing while he was watching TV, reading a book, playing video games etc or even sitting down and having a serious conversation about why his behavior is upsetting. I personally think pranks are cruel even small pranks like this one was. If the point is to teach someone a lesson by humiliating them that makes it cruel.", "Top notch parenting. NTA.", "You can feel guilty but you aren't the asshole he could have easily explained it away or played it off as his prank.... unless he had a girl he likes there now it's friend zone for him( but boys at home shouldn't be hanging out with girls at home and vice versa) so assuming that's not the case let the good times role good on you mom", ">NTA. \"Fart around and find out\"\n\n100% my favorite part of the post \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 NTA I wholeheartedly agree.", "My dad would've come up with the 'fart around and find out' pun FIRST, then figured out the whoopi cushions. Dads striving for embarrassment are different.", "Saying \u201corgasm\u201d instead of \u201corganism\u201d when asked to read aloud in science class\u2026", "NTA. Maybe he will stop farting in your face while you\u2019re watching tv now!", "NTA Your son got off easy. I have an ileostomy and a bag. My farts are not like everyone else's nicely cultured and aged stuff, no, when you think of my farts you need to put the Nazi face melting scene from Raiders in your head. I always have a fart ready for anyone who wants to lose that game badly. lol", "I love Abby and Bert\ud83d\ude2d", "So? You're the parent. Stop talking to him. Start giving him a consequence, every time.\n\nI wouldn't go overboard with this, but 24 hours being grounded with no friends or screens for the first offense, 48 for the second, 72 for the third - I somehow think he probably wouldn't try a fourth time to see if you'd continue the pattern.", "Lord why I am I one the ones who called their teacher mom?! In a school with only 60 kids?!?! Lol she was more my mom than my actual mom though.", "if that\u2019s the most embarrassing thing that\u2019s happened to him his school must be okay"]}
