Putting a pair of comfy shorts or pj bottoms on isn't going to be the end of the world for her. I'm sure she wouldn't appreciate seeing an unrelated 40 year old man wandering around in his boxers. This isn't a sexual thing. It's being considerate of the people around you.", "NAH my mom had that talk with me when she got married bc I was a sports bra  and undies and tshirt and undies girl when it was just us.

You're saying that this isn't JUST your or their home anymore, it's EVERYONE'S home, and not everyone who is now making this house their home knows each other very well yet. \n\nRedditors love to jump to hyperbole and shrieky accusations of \"YoU'rE sEXuaLizInG yOuR kIDs!\" and \"Why are they even looking with their creepy man-eyes at all?!\" but that's not even what this is about. This is about the fact that there are now two groups of people sharing a home who *for the time being* are something more than strangers and less than family, and who need time to get to know each other. And it's really reasonable to ask that *everyone* in the household, inclusive of your daughters, not walk around in their underwear and use the basic standard of \"would you wear this around a friendly acquaintance\" *just until everyone gets to feel a little more comfortable with each other and it feels safe and like home to all the inhabitants*. \n\nYou're not accusing your daughters of anything, nor suggesting that your new stepson or husband are weird creeps. You're saying that normally, people don't walk around half-dressed in front of people they haven't gotten to know well yet . . . and you're asking for some time for everyone to get acclimated before house rules devolve back to \"we're all family here so anything goes\". That seems pretty fair. NTA.", "[deleted]", "NTA.

You don't walk around in your underwear in front of your roommates in shared spaces. I don't even walk around in my underwear in front of my grandma and don't hang out in the living room in my panties in front of my mother. That's a matter of being polite when in company.", "I\u2019m baffled at the amount of Y T A in this post! Like people on here are so idealistic it isn\u2019t even realistic anymore. Imagine you are a 40 year old man and your step underage daughter parades half naked in the living room watching tv with you. I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable, i wouldn\u2019t even be able to look at her. \n\nNevermind the problem of the step son who is a 17 year old teenage boy filled with hormones. The oldest girl is one year younger than him. It\u2019s weird.  And it\u2019s awkward, no matter what you idealistic people say. \n\nHowever I understand your daughter\u2019s refusal.

And you said: \n\n>I\u2019m less comfortable with my daughters walking around dressed like that. \n\nWhat about the husband and teenagers? Is this your issue or a larger one? How did you prepare for this merge of two families? You can't just move people into your house without proper preparation unless you want be a sit com family.", "Info: did your husband and stepson mention that they felt uncomfortable? If so why haven't you had a family meeting about it so your daughter can learn that it's important to respect everyone's right to feel comfortable in their own home.", "NTA. Your 16 yo daughter needs to learn some decency around the house. I really don\u2019t understand how she doesn\u2019t feel uncomfortable walking around like that when basically strangers to her are now living there. Some shorts and a tshirt wont kill her. And as you said that your new husband and stepson are feeling uncomfortable by this, it\u2019s just a matter of respect but she\u2019s making a big fuss over nothing", "I'm confused about why you waited until after the wedding to have this discussion. Then again, I'm also confused at anyone walking around their home in just underwear. On the other hand, I'm confused why it makes you uncomfortable now. Did you mean it makes your husband uncomfortable? \n\nI mean, as long as your stepson and husband are held to the same expectations, I'm leaning to NAH as your daughter is being a teenager and pushing boundaries which shows you def didn't fully prepare them for how your marriage would change their way of life, and I will say -- the state of dress won't matter if your stepson and daughter decide to hook up. If they don't consider that problematic, then the clothing rule won't stop that. \n\nAlso, if your husband is the type to sexualize children, then her state of dress also won't change anything.", "I'm honestly confused why either of them would WANT to run around in underwear around men they don't know well/didn't grow up with. Could it be some frustration-behavior by your 16 YO? Is she unhapy about them moving in and might want to make them uncomfortable?\n\nI guess you can't force them to wear more, but I see nothing wrong with asking them to put on some clothes.\n\nSo NTA.", "NTA. For context, I was 14 when my father decided to remarry. She had two daughters, (15 and 12). At that point in my life I worked out a lot and generally slept in my boxers. After a couple of months, my father asked that I start wearing lounge pants or shorts, and take clothes with me when I had to shower at least when I came out of my room, even at night to avoid making them uncomfortable. It's not about sexualization, it's about respect. While it is important for the girls to be comfortable, the near nude teen girls could still make the husband and stepson uncomfortable as well. If the stepson were walking around wearing practically nothing, something should still be said.", "NTA and all the hate is insane. Not wanting to see your sister's/daughter's ass and tits hanging out isn't unreasonable and not sexualizing them. I used to do gay porn and very comfortable around nudity, doesn't mean I'd be thrilled with seeing my brother's dick every day.", "Baffled by all these Y-T-As. If your new husband or stepson walked around wearing nothing but a speedo all the time, I can only imagine it would make your daughters uncomfortable. I would feel extremely uncomfortable and completely avoid even looking at them.\n\nNTA, possibly NAH.", "I understand if you\u2019re worried about them walking around in only bras and underwear. It\u2019s a respect thing. Short shorts and little tank tops shouldn\u2019t be a problem though. I hate that people are insinuating that your husband is a creep, that\u2019s a stretch.", "Some of you are absolutely wild! Stop trying to make everything about sexualization! OP asking her children to wear more than underwear does not necessarily mean they are being sexualized! You can show common courtesy and respect with sex having nothing to do with the situation. The fact that so many of your minds go there is frankly disturbing. OP\u2019s step son is around the same age as her oldest daughter and going through the same family changes, why does OP wanting him to feel comfortable automatically make him a creep? My word! NTA OP, I understand what you\u2019re trying to do and see nothing wrong with it.", "NTA. I think a lot of comments are misconstruing this as her husband and stepson don\u2019t know how to not look, but OP didn\u2019t say that at all. I think it was perfectly reasonable to sit down and talk with your daughters about it. My opinion is the older one is \u201crebelling\u201d by wearing even less. Just don\u2019t give her attention for the negative behavior. I would try to figure out what she\u2019s angry about and is acting out for attention for to try to help with whatever is going on there.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a situation of compromise. New people sharing a common space always need to adapt their living approaches, have conversations, and define mutually acceptable boundaries.\n\nReverse the situations genders and ask again and how would peoples responses differ?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a 45 yr old male with 2 sons (14 & 16yrs) who like to wear less clothing in the house. They\u2019ve always done so and just feel comfortable that way. Often just underwear and a t shirt, sometimes thongs. My new wife (40yr old) and daughter in law (17) have just moved in 3 weeks ago. I\u2019ve talked to my sons, about how it may make them feel uncomfortable to see so much exposed body, and the 14 yr has agreed to be more considerate. But the 16 yr old is wearing even less deliberately to make a point.\u201d\n\nIn this situation who is the asshole? Whilst people will likely deny it, most would probably state the 16yr old son was deliberately being dominant, controlling and even sexually threatening to prove a point. Someone should sit down with him and ask what\u2019s really at the root of his tantrum and defiance, because it\u2019s not his rights being oppressed based on gender.\n\nBeing a teenager is probably almost as tough as being a parent. He\u2019s probably hurting, scared, and rejecting the sudden change and loss of control. Trying to approach him/her from a place of empathy (and active listening) rather than frustration will be hard, but that\u2019s the higher path, and will probably lead to a more honest open dialogue, helping your daughter integrate with her new family members rather than rebelling  against the dynamic. \n\nLast point, sometimes I find a good way of having tough triggering conversations is to say: \u201cThis doesn\u2019t have to be the final conversation, but I\u2019d like it to be the start of one we can return to, so we can both gain a better understanding each other\u2019s perspectives.\u201d", "Ah Reddit, the only place on the internet where people get married without ever really stepping foot in their partners house or interacting with their children.", "INFO: how did you approach it with the girls?", "My 15 y.o. daughter came to stay with me one summer when I was a full time student renting a room in a home. The owner was a 42 y.o. female with a live in boyfriend and her 2 boys ( 14y.o., 12y.o.) from a previous relationship. I spoke with her before she came out about how we have to cover and dress appropriately because she was coming into a home with teenage boys and we all had to dress appropriately at all times since we were guests in someone's home.  I bought her pajamas and a couple outfits that were cute and safe. We all had a great time she spent hours playing video and board games with the boys and it was a great summer.", "NTA. Basic respect and consideration is a thing everyone in the house should practice. The girls won't die if they have to switch to oversized t-shirts that cover their underwear. The boys equally won't die if they need to wear pj pants instead of boxers", "NTA, it\u2019s a hard scenario, but you\u2019re not asking them to wear a nun\u2019s outfit or the like, but it\u2019s hard to ask them to change, they\u2019ll likely have to get used to it at one point or another in their life (dormitory at university, if they decide to be a parent, etc\u2026) but to me it sounds like it\u2019s the most fair approach for the new family.", "NTA. The men have a right to feel comfortable in their home too. If they are uncomfortable with people walking around in just underwear then ask for a baseline shorts and tee shirt/tank top rule seems reasonable. Everyone is acting like you are overly sexualizing your daughters. But plenty of families have  wear clothes in the public areas of the house rules. If the men are allowed to walk around in just underwear or you are then that is a problem. But when I was a teen I had a brother that was VERY uncomfortable with any level of nudity. He would be upset if I saw him in underwear or if he saw me in underwear. It was nothing sexual. He just had a different comfort level than I did. Because of that I would make sure to have shorts and a tee shirt on when I was not in my room.", "NTA. This isn't as much about your daughter's bodily autonomy as it is about making sure everyone who lives there is comfortable in their home. Which they absolutely have a right to be. By refusing to cover up, she is prioritizing her comfort over theirs, which is petty and selfish. If she wants to hang out in her underwear, she can do so in her room and not in shared spaces. \n\nCaveat- if the men in the home are walking around in just their underpants, my argument goes right out the window and you're TA.", "NTA. As long as the rules are the same for everyone. Either everyone can dress in next to nothing or everyone has to have a layer of clothes. \n\nA lot of people are taking this as the repression of the female form or that your husband is a creep. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I think you\u2019re just trying to make your home comfortable for everyone. \n\nBesides, humans are inherently sexual. See: nudity, porn, romance novels, strip clubs. It\u2019s okay to actually want to protect everyone in your house. Whether it\u2019s the girls from being stared at or the guys from not being comfortable. \n\nI only mention the men\u2019s comfort because (as a woman) I don\u2019t want to see my CHILD\u2019S ass hanging out of a thong in my own home and be concerned that I\u2019m going to be seen as some weird villain.", "Doesn\u2019t anyone else thinks it\u2019s weird to only wear underwear casually around your family?", "NAH.\n\nIt's understandable that you'd feel uncomfortable with the situation as would your husband and, especially, his kid. The husband has to be conscious all the time of making sure to look away, lest people think he's a creep, and then even looking away too obviously makes it seem odd. His kid is likely to feel the same way, with all of the teen awkwardness thrown in.\n\nAt the same time, your daughters are dealing with a whole new living situation and are being told that they even have to change how they dress.\n\nSounds like everyone should talk and just get acquainted with the new situation.", "NTA - I really don\u2019t get the Y-T-A people here - I\u2019ll throw out the reverse the roles card - would you think it\u2019s appropriate for the new husband and 17M son to walk around the house in thongs? Hell, maybe you guys would be fine with that. Maybe OP should encourage husband and stepson to do this. After all, there\u2019s apparently nothing inherently sexual about wandering around the house in your underwear.", "NTA - I can\u2019t believe how many people are saying you are. It\u2019s just common courtesy. Do they wear clothes when other family and friends come over? Do the sons or your new husband walk around in just briefs all the time? Good grief.", "I\u2019m a NTA vote - I\u2019m astounded that the assumption is that she\u2019s sexualizing her children? My boyfriend sleeps naked but if the kids are home he wears at least underwear in case someone needs Mom in the middle of the night. It\u2019s not about sexualization it\u2019s about everyone\u2019s comfort in a shared living space. Like closing the door when you\u2019re taking a shit lol (no, I\u2019m not saying bodies are gross as poo, either). Mom, you\u2019re NTA, at all. Kudos to you for raising kids comfortable enough with themselves for this to even be an issue.", "NTA OP made it clear that her husband feels uncomfortable and makes a point to look away. It\u2019s not an unreasonable ask. I\u2019m sure her daughters would feel uncomfortable with step dad or brother walking around in undies too. Not sure why everyone is making it out to be more than it is and giving OP so much shit. It\u2019s an adjustment for everybody and comprises need to be made by all. It\u2019s not gona kill the girl\u2019s to chuck on a pair of shorts and a crop top or trackies (I\u2019m Aussie I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s called in the US apologies) instead of walking around in panties and a bra.", "NTA.  I\u2019m kind of shocked by the number of people calling you out.  Do your girls just wear bras and underwear when their friends come over?  When family comes over?  It\u2019d be a different story if you were telling them they had to wear long pants and long sleeve shirts.   They can put on a tank top and volleyball shorts.  It\u2019s not a sexualization thing. It\u2019s a \u201cwhy are you in your underwear?\u201d thing.  It\u2019s bizarre that this is even a question and it\u2019s even more bizarre that people are fighting it. Is it just me?  Am I in the minority because I put on clothes everyday?", "Going against the grain and will no doubt get downvoted, but NTA. You're not demanding they wear floor-length smocks or anything like that, you're just asking them to throw on a pair of shorts or sweat pants. In general, I think people should go ahead and wear actual clothes around the common areas of the house when others are present, regardless of gender or if they're family or guests. It's just good manners and that's not a terrible thing to practice. \n\nIt's not out of line to ask that everyone in the house be considerate of one another, especially since your husband and stepson are feeling so uncomfortable about this as they try to adjust to their new home, which is probably challenging enough on its own. I'm guessing they don't walk around the house half dressed? Your daughters can offer them the same courtesy.", "NTA. It's a great time to discuss consent. While she may be more comfortable, not everyone in the home is.  You all also deserve to be comfortable in common living spaces. I remember in college, some people were very comfortable with nudity, and it made their same sex roommates quite upset bc they had nowhere to go that was \"safe\" for them.  You are blending two families, and it's natural to have discussions/redefine what works for everyone, but that IS hard- especially at 16. I would acknowledge that.", "I'm leaning towards NTA but you need to make this a rule for everyone not just your daughters. It wouldn't be very fair if your husband or stepson could walk around shirtless or in boxers so tell everyone in the house that if they're gonna be leaving their rooms to put clothes on.", "NTA there\u2019s a difference between wearing shorts/ crop tops/ mini skirts/ sports bras and wearing literal underwear. I\u2019m a woman and would have no idea where to look if my new step sibling walked around the house in a bra and pants and nothing else and would 100 percent be uncomfortable.", "NTA.\n\nI understand why since they aren\u2019t blood-related to her. And to make everyone comfortable. As long as this rule is enforced for everybody then I don\u2019t see a problem.", "NTA. Idc if this gets downvoted but it\u2019s odd enough that the girls have been wearing close to nothing in a shared home. Now with two new people coming in, some sacrifices need to be made. To be fair, asking someone to throw on a pair of shorts seems like a tiny sacrifice (if you can even call it that). When they move out on their own they can wear nothing at home if they want but in a shared home with a blended family it\u2019s not okay. I do think your 16 year old is just trying to be difficult/lashing out. Ask her, if rolls were reversed, would she be okay seeing a 40 year old man and a teenage boy with their junk out?", "NTA HAS EVERYONE LOST THEIR FUCKING MINDS?! What is with all these y-t-a comments?!OP, you are doing the right thing, it's so weird that your daughters feel completely comfortable walking around in their underwear around men that they have no blood relationship to, I still change in the bathroom when I see my half sisters and leave the room when they change because it's just weird!\n\nIt's not shaming, it's not sexualizing, these are two men who would probably still be uncomfortable if they were blood related, let's not make this into something it isn't with all these \"misogyny\" comments lmao", "NTA. It\u2019s about basic common courtesy and respect. Yeah, me and my husband do this because we live alone with our cats, but we have enough brain cells to know to put clothes on when family, friends, step-family, whoever, comes over. This is no different than if I walked around half naked around my in-laws. It\u2019s fucking weird. When I stayed with my in-laws before we got married, I never walked around half dressed, because what the fuck? \n\nShe\u2019s trying to make some weird \u201cpoint\u201d by making everyone uncomfortable for no reason. She\u2019s going to do this in front of non-family members one day and then act shocked and indignant when she\u2019s treated in a sexualized manner. \ud83d\ude44 \n\nFrankly I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to see my older brother walking around with his dick hanging out either. Nasty. I guarantee if your husband and his sons start walking around dressed like Donald Duck, she would have an issue with it. But muh feminism or whatever, right? Her internet ideology supersedes basic norms of respectful behavior, apparently. I would not accept this behavior from her and would immediately place consequences if she does not wear a basic minimum of clothing.", "When I read the title I was leaning Y T A but once I read, definitely NTA. I doubt your husband and stepson consented to this and even if not, that is still a very uncomfortable boundary to press. It\u2019s inappropriate behavior, if it was a boy or girl in my opinion. Now these rules should also be enforced if your husband or stepson try and walk around in just boxers/briefs.", "NAH. You\u2019re not unreasonable to ask them to wear more given that 2 men now share the home. But 14 and 16 is SUCH a tender age for developing girls , they are constantly made to feel that their bodies are provocative, wrong, sexually explicit. \n\nUnless they are wearing sheer undergarments or thongs around their stepdad/stepbro, let them fucking live. The female body is not inherently sexual.", "NTA. It's normal and civil to wear clothing around other people. I wouldn't want my father sitting at the dining room table in just a speedo and it's certainly not because I am sexualizing him. It's respectful to wear clothing around other people, and it's respectful to apply the same rules of propriety to everyone. The answer here is to say that everyone must wear clothing in the common areas (no shirtlessness or underwear for the men either). \n\nIt's also normal for teenagers to push back on rules, especially rules that are new/changing at a time with significant other life changes. I'd approach Brooklyn with empathy and be clear that this isn't about her body or sexuality, it's just about trying to accommodate the culture of new members of the family who have a family that isn't as comfortable with body exposure, and ask her to try to approach them with kindness and understanding. After all, some families take nude sauna visits together, but we generally wouldn't foist that upon people who felt uncomfortable with it.", "NTA. the people saying otherwise are just frothing at the mouth to repeat their same old script they analyze every situation with. One thing people never mention about step-family relationships is the simple dynamic that if you and your husband are attracted to each other, why would it be a stretch if the 16 year old and 17 year old, who are not in any way related, be attracted to each other?", "This won't be popular but NTA.  There is nothing wrong with showing a bit of respect for your new hubby and his son.  Yes, it's a change for your daughters but particularly Brooklyn needs to grow up and learn that life doesn't revolve around her.", "Info: Are you requesting that your new husband and son wear shirts and pants at all times as well? It\u2019s only fair if this is being enforced for everyone.", "NTA  Just make it a gender neutral rule for the whole house.", "NTA. How do you wear less?\n\nBut they should be considerate if they want the same treatment.", "NTA - I never felt comfortable wearing less when I lived with my parents as a teen, and I also had a teen brother. It makes everyone uncomfortable. I would have been uncomfortable if my dad or brother walked around w/o a shirt and just bottoms on. Household dynamics have changed, so now everyone has to take others into consideration.", "NAH - it doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re worried about your husband/stepson sexualizing the girls, it seems more like you want to make sure that your stepson and husband can feel comfortable in what is now their home too. that\u2019s not an AH move. \nhowever, i feel like it\u2019s pretty likely that your daughter is acting out about this because she\u2019s feeling some stress or anxiety about the changes to her family. it might be deeper than the clothes. speaking from personal experience, when my mom remarried i really struggled and acted out - nobody realized what was going on and they all thought i was just being an AH. nobody really checked in to see if something was underlying it. to me this looks like your daughter is seeking something she can have control over since she can\u2019t control all the changes she\u2019s experiencing. \ni would have a conversation with her about how she\u2019s coping with everything going on, and without bringing the topic of her clothes into it. it might help you get to the root cause more easily.\ngood luck & congratulations on your growing family!!\n(edited for clarity)", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m honestly surprised by the amount of \u201cYTA\u201d here. Sorry guys, the kids are 14 and 16. OP talked to them about re-marrying and it seems like they were fine with it.\n\nAt the end of the day, these are young maturing women (here comes the \u201cStOp SeXUaliZinG tHe KiDz\u201d people), and at that age, you really should be wearing clothing in shared spaces unless at the beach or pool (See: going to the mall, going to school). It would be different if they were children maybe under the age of 10 - but they aren\u2019t. Like it\u2019s actually strange to me they don\u2019t understand these basic social norms. In addition, they are now sharing space with a 17 year old boy who has had no prior relation to them, so yes, their bodies could potentially look sexualized to him. Sure he can avert his eyes but literally doing that all day? Seriously just throw on some pants\n\nOP should not bend over backwards to give the girls what they want. Her house her rules. This is *not* an outrageous or oppressive ask.\n\nEdit: when i am at my brother in laws house, guess what guys, he doesnt wear boxers or tank tops. Woulda ya look at that! Equal standards between genders; its about basic etiquette", "NTA  but I think this issue and other that may be similar MUST be agreed BEFORE merging the 2 families. \n\nLets turn it around: I bet your daughters would be uncomfortable if your hub or stepson walked around wearing only briefs or even shirtless. \n\nI hope you all find empathy to try yo make the house a living and relaxing place for all.\n\nEDIT TO ADD to OP or anyone reading this: other issues that you must agree are: \n\n-when can the people in the house have friends over\n- if they bring guest, should they tell in advance? How much time? To who? \n- the dutys of each person to keep the house clean\n- how to communicate any issue they may have with each other \n\nThis are de big ones, I think. Also, i dont know how much each person knew each other before the merging", "NTA. However you could have waited to merge these families. Looking at this situation, I feel sad because their seems to be some sadness causing rebellion. I understand that you got married and wanting the girls to dress more conservative in the home but this discussion should have happened before the blending of the homes.", "Do you have the same rules for your step-son?", "NTA - I\u2019m looking at it with a what makes everyone comfortable approach. Yeah your daughters are used to wearing less clothing but would they be okay with it if their step dad/brother to be in their underwear too? \n\nJust like how they want to be comfortable in their home, so does your husband and his son. If everyone is okay with walking around in their underwear, then that\u2019s a different thing.", "NTA - nobody should be forced to hang out with people in their underwear if they don\u2019t want to. The comparison with the pool is nonsense imo, because everyone going to the pool knows how people are dressed and can make their own choices. I\u2019m 100% sure those girls would not be hyped either if 40+ years old stepdad had moved in and decided not to wear anything, because he has always been nudist before, or to walk around the house in his boxers all the time - and I\u2019m also 100% sure if that had been the case and he had posted here, it would have hailed Y-T-A for him.

Part of that process is, they need to focus on routine, without changing it too much.  That is, they need to feel comfortable in their own home.  It is not unusual for girls of any age to wear basically nothing around home.  If you have guests over, it is appropriate to put some clothes on.  But if you don't have GUESTS in the house, are you supposed to run around 24/7/365 fully clothed, just to make other people living in the house comfortable?  Of course not.  If their comfort is disturbed by your natural behavior in your own home, that is not your problem to solve.\n\nWhat it boils down to, there is no problem here.
