I came in here initially thinking that was YOUR wedding dress.", "NTA, but also I think there\u2019s another way to handle this. Since she is worried about not finding a dress in time, offer to go shopping with your mom to help her find something. This will both allow you to direct her to something you see as appropriate, and relieve her concern. Win-win.", "I thought that was the bride dress, she\u2019s definitely living through you at this point", "NTA everyone knows you don\u2019t wear white or anything resembling white to someone else\u2019s wedding. Why is she so fixated on a dress? Especially one that would take away your attention?", "NTA. What does she mean when she says she\u2019s worried she won\u2019t find a dress in time? The wedding is two years away. She\u2019s just mad you\u2019re not letting her take the spotlight and she knows that.

This is oddly like a wedding dress for a MOB to choose.", "NTA. Your wedding. Your day. Your rules, period. Anyone saying otherwise is just selfish. \nI can see how it may be frustrating for her but it\u2019s not her day. She can always find another dress, you can\u2019t redo your wedding day", "NTA.

Do not allow her entitled-ness to ruin your wedding.", "NTA, the dress is way too bridal for anyone other than the bride.

On the positive side, it sounds like she might still change her mind a few more times before the wedding.", "NTA. Besides the colour, it's obviously not a MOB dress. Is she aware she isn't the focus of the day?", "NTA. To me, the dress doesn\u2019t look off-white or white, and I think it\u2019s pretty as a Mother of the Bride dress. But it defies logic to send you pictures of dresses for your approval and then (when you don\u2019t approve) say too bad, I already bought it. It doesn\u2019t sound like she really cared about your opinion at all, and I think it\u2019s reasonable that you\u2019re annoyed about it.", "NTA- that dress is obviously white and taupe   \nIt shouts look at me.", "NTA: If some one showed me that picture without context I would think it's a possible bridal dress.\n\nBetween the style and colour it's a big NO.", "NTA that absolutely looks like a bridal dress.", "NTA\n\nThat\u2019s a wedding dress. \n\nThat champagne color is very popular right now. Add in the lace and embellishment, and you\u2019ve got a wedding dress.\n\nAnd your mom knows it.\n\nThe rule is that you try not to look or dress like the bride. The part of that people focus on is not wearing white. But the over-arching rule is that you leave bridal-looking attire for the bride.", "ESH. I\u2019ve definitely seen MOB dresses this color, and similar (champagne, etc.) you mom should have taken your concerns into consideration, but this is actually a relatively standard MOB dress. I would go see it in person, or ask her to take a photo of it next to a white dress or shirt - you might be surprised at how different it looks in context. If you still hate it, offer to go shopping with her next time you see her to look for something else, or see if it can be dyed a slightly darker brown. Getting mad about it won\u2019t make anyone feel any better, so I\u2019d work on trying to find an amicable solution.", "YTA - That's a perfectly acceptable mother of the bride dress.

I'm wondering if this has less to do with a competition for attention and more to do with a deep seated fear of her being officially \"old\" if she attends your wedding in a soft pink, blue, green, peach, etc.  It sounds like a very sad case of wanting to turn back the clock.", "NTA I don\u2019t know a lot about dresses but my gf does i showed her this picture and yup it\u2019s a wedding dress stand your ground", "NTA. Not even *close* be being TA. She is completely out of line.", "NTA, but I don't,  as many seem to, think the dress looks like a wedding dress.

I'm sure you can make her match your color scheme!", "It's not white or even close to it", "NTA. Did you ask her if she got the matching veil?", "NTA. That's way too close to a wedding dress to wear to someone else's wedding. I don't buy that she bought it on clearance either. She's definitely trying to upstage you. She can find some other event to wear it to, she needs to find a dress that can't be confused with a wedding dress.", "Nta. Mummy is jealous that you will be getting attention I think. That is completely inappropriate for a mob dress. Here it's normal for the mothers to dress nice but kinda frumpy. After all what kind of a mother tries to outshine her daughter on her wedding day?", "YTA.  She\u2019s right. It\u2019s not white or even off white.   No one\u2019s going to mistake her for the bride in that dress, and that should be your only potential objection to her wearing it.

My mother showed up in a white two-piece dress and jacket with a little bit of pink embroidery on the jacket. Not what I\u2019d suggested, but no one mistook her for me.  (Also, Father in law was drunk and cued the organist to start the wedding March before I got to the church\u2026 a grand time was had by all!)", "NAH. I think it's a beautiful dress and it's not like anyone will think she's the bride. I'd let it go.

The mom is clearly desperate and excited to shop for her MOTB dress, and wedding boutiques almost always have MOTB gowns to wear.  Why not select a dress around the time OP goes shopping for her dress, or at least schedule an appointment before the bridal dress appointment so she can get her gown --- AND OP can make sure she gets a say in the color?", "It looks taupe/champagne which is a popular MOB color.

Hell, I hope to get married in a technicolor gown (likely some shade of pink). Yeah, you have your traditional \"white weddings,\" but more and more, people are breaking the rules and doing weddings their way.  Beige is an incredibly popular color, especially with wedding dresses, and I could see a bride who is older or having a small ceremony wear this on her wedding day.", "Yeah, not at all possible someone just has a different opinion.", "It's a perfectly fine mother of the bride dress.", "That's not taupe. Ecru at the best. NTA but your mother has a few issues, huh?", "NTA - That very much looks like a wedding dress to me, and the rude and unreasonable one is here your mother.\n\nIf she turns up in that dress she's going to get talked about for all the wrong reasons!", "NTA I saw the dress first and thought that was your wedding dress. I immediately thought any taupe is too close to your dress. Then I read that was her dress? That is a very firm NO. Mummy dearest is trying to make your wedding her do over. Is she often jealous of you? My mother was extremely jealous of me and would do terrible things to sabotage me including my wedding.", "I love finding Randy Jackson-esque sentences in the wild"]}
