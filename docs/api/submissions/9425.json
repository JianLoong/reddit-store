What's coming up for you as you think about my wedding?\n\nYou just get to do your inner work and figure out what will guide your responses to her when she's getting ridiculous. It could be compassion, it could be protecting your peace, it could be curiosity for what she's experiencing, it could be anxiety or panic cycles. You choose.", "Putting aside the colour of that it could be your wedding dress is it really so bad that she wear it? It is your mom after all", "NTA \n\nHow about offering a choice to dye it. A tailor might have some recommendations on getting it to come out well if you're not willing to just throw it in a vat of rit dye.", "Omg, NTA. If someone showed up to a wedding wearing that dress, I\u2019d assume they\u2019re the bride.", "NTA. You could tell her you want her to wear the same color as the bridesmaids, that way she can feel special and a part of the wedding without looking like a bride.", "100% that is a wedding dress. And it cost almost as much as my actual wedding dress. NTA.", "Every woman knows not to wear white or off-white at a wedding.  To do so is a very aggressive in your face statement that the traditional etiquette doesn't apply to me.  I will display a premeditated rude and belligerent behavior and nobody will shame me.  Ask your mom or aunt if you don't believe me...", ">your mom who is supportive and will be there for you no matter what?\n\nIrony much? LOL  Her mom is LITERALLY disregarding OPs feelings about the dress--which I agree is highly inappropriate for her mom to wear.", "Have you picked your dress yet?  Maybe wait on judgement until then, and put the dresses side by side.  If they aren't close in color and tone, your mom can keep her dress.  If they're similar,  she needs to find a new dress", "Yes, Mom\u2019s TA but I\u2019d really like to know where she found that gorgeous dress!", "I might look darker in person and come off as less champagne (which is a popular wedding gown color these days) but you're still left with the fact the cut and the embellishments also look *very* bridal.", "Here is the link! The dress comes in platinum, sea mist, and taupe.  But its a bit spendy at $700. \n\nhttps://macduggal.com/products/67539", "See, Platinum or Sea Mist would be fine!", "Thank you!!!", "Not really. They're still way to close to white imo and could appear even lighter in pictures.", "What are you talking about. The link literally has blue and dark silver, those are nowhere near white or taupe.", "NTA \n\nMom need to take a seat", "That\u2019s a wedding dress. Big no!\n\nTell her you take her shopping when the event gets closer and leave it at that. Don\u2019t engage anymore when it comes to the dress. NTA", "That looks like a typical mother of the bride/groom dress. Classy.", "Your mum has good taste in dresses so I can't bring myself to condemn her.  That's a lovely dress.  I think you should take her advice on what to wear and while your at it pick up something for her you both can live with.\n\nNAH", "NAH. Obviously traditions and opinions vary. To me that looks way more like a mother of the bride dress than a wedding gown and it is clearly not white or off white - it is a very definite beige which would lovely and elegant on an older woman. However, I can plainly see all the comments that disagree with me - which is why I say NAH. Your mom bought a dress that she reasonably thought would be fine - you, also reasonably disagree. To me, it feels like a strange hill to die on - when I got married I just wanted my mom and MIL to feel comfortable and happy. But Because it is your wedding, you win - she should get another dress and save this for some lovely black tie event. \n\nI almost went with E S H because I could easily point out where you at also both in the wrong. She should not have bought a non-refundable dress without your input and you for being so overly concerned about what you mom is wearing.", "NTA that looks like a wedding dress.", "NTA- could the dress be professionally dyed?", "NTA my cousin got married in a dress like that.", "NTA - That looks like a wedding dress, in fact it looks exactly like the dress my mom wore to her second wedding (minus the flowers). Beautiful dress though.", "NTA. Beautiful dress, IF YOU WERE THE BRIDE.  It's not only the color, but the style and design that would make it an awesome bridal gown.", "NTA. The seamist is lovely though and if she\u2019s worried about finding another have here order that one. \nI didn\u2019t catch what your bridesmaids dresses and wedding colors are but that light green is neutral enough to go with pretty much everything.", "NTA. You should see if your mom Is able to dye the dress without ruining it? I don\u2019t know how well fabric dye would work on that, though. If not, tell her she can wear the dress to a different occasion and that she needs to pick something else or she\u2019ll be removed from the wedding.", "NTA! Just how formal/extravagant of a wedding are you planning? This is not screaming Mother of the Bride, more look at me, me, me!", "Tell her she can wear it to her next wedding or redoing her vows. NTA", "NTA That looks like a wedding dress. She\u2019s out of line.", "NTA. She jumped the gun. \n\nThat said, my MIL wore a floor length ivory chiffon gown with a little beadwork on it to my wedding. I laughed about it among friends and with my now husband, but it was straight up more bridal than my own dress. NOBODY mistook her for the bride either. Just saying. \n\nIf this is the boundary you're not budging on, stand your ground. I'd wonder if she's going to pull similar antics with other aspects of the wedding.", "NTA. It is an unspoken rule you don\u2019t wear white, cream, blush, or light tan to a wedding.", "NTA. The style of this dress is definitely bridal and you specifically asked her to stay away from these colors. But, for those commenting on the color, it is common for MOBs to wear a champagne/taupe dress at the wedding.", "NTA I've looked at the dress. It's pretty enough, but NO. NO. NO. NO. NO.  \n\n\nI attended a wedding where the Mother of the Bride wore a similar dress in pale pink.  \n\n\nShe looked like Miss Havisham.", "YTA. That\u2019s a mother of the bride dress. Do you really think your guests who come to celebrate you are going to be dazzled by your mom in her beige dress, get confused, and think she is you? Or are you just punishing her for being excited and anxious?", "Tell her she can dye it, shorten it, exchange it, or buy something else. Inform her that if she shows up in this dress she will be required to either change or leave, then make sure that you have someone there with an appropriate alternate dress and the fortitude to compel the change or departure. \n\nAlso tell her that thousands of people on the internet are already ridiculing her choice of dress and that you don\u2019t want your family and friends ridiculing her too. \n\nNTA", "eh not really to me. with the sleeves and cut, it looks like a typical mob or mog dress, but i also think nude and beige aren\u2019t wedding dress colors.\n\nbut if she\u2019s asking because she wants your opinion and okay, she should respect it.

She should be able to return it.", "Wow it even says easy returns!", "The dresses show up as slightly blueish and more purple toned silver on my phone. Both of them are super light in color too. And personally, I count silver as way too close to white too.", "It's a gorgeous dress though.  Too bad she can't wear it to your wedding.  Is she trying to outshine the bride?  Did your mom have her own wedding dress?  Is she trying to make up for something she missed out on?", "NTA", "I realize that everyone perceives colors differently but I personally don\u2019t see taupe as being close to off white.

Go shopping with her.  Every one of my daughters got to pick out what they wanted me to wear.  That way I knew it was something they liked.  We had such fun shopping for my dress at each wedding.  Each daughter wanted me to wear something they felt was beautiful.", "LOL its totally a wedding dress but in a slightly beige tone.

At this point, I'd be tempted to \"assign\" a color to the mothers, but basically, just tell your MIL her color is what she wants it to be.\n\nSorry you have to deal with someone like this. :/", "> *Playing games like \u201cthis is light beige not white\u201d is shady*.\n\nAnother *shady* aspect of the dress - depending on the mother's skin tones, or her degree of suntan - she may look like she's in a semi transparent \"Happy Birthday Mr. President\" dress.\n\nNTA, OP", "Same", "Omg! My friends aunt wore this dress in the sea mist for her second wedding! My friend and the other bridesmaids wore deep pine green dresses and the scheme was stunning.", "Well, if it\u2019s any consolation, one of the reviews said the taupe was a dusty rose color.", "TBH, all the colourways read as bridal. None of them are a good choice for a wedding *guest*.", "Literally google mother of the bride dress and you'll get search results with similar cuts, styling, and colors.", "Yeah, those all just look off-white to me lol", "This is simply the first link that popped up when I did a reverse image search.
