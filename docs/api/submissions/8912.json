Basically what I\u2019m saying is I\u2019m totally against this fucking ring doorbell and have asked it be taken down several times. \n\nMy sister has refused because there is a common area downstairs and our doors connect through a mud room so someone could break in to my door and get to her stuff. You can see the entire driveway(the only way you can get to the back) on hers. It\u2019s overkill to have two of them. \n\nIt is also simply MY DOOR!

I\u2019m not taking extra/special trips outside.
