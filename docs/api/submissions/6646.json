My mom was always there for me and we spent so much time together. Her death was unexpected and fast. It blindsided me and I haven\u2019t been the same since then. \n\nMy dad and I haven\u2019t been close at all really, but I\u2019m staying with him while I search for a place to move out. I\u2019ve been helping him with bills such as rent snd utilities. However, what he did on New Year\u2019s Eve really caught me off guard. \n\nI had my dad come and pick me up from work since I was feeling sick and didn\u2019t feel comfortable driving home. When I walked to the car, this woman was in the car. I just stood there in shock. Let\u2019s call her Becky. He says, \u201cthis is Becky. She\u2019s \u2018just a friend\u2019 (yeah right)\u201d I say \u201chello\u201d, and look out the window because I was trying to mentally process everything. He keeps trying to get me to talk but I don\u2019t want to. You\u2019re just gonna bring this random woman you\u2019re seeing back to the place after my mom passed not even a year ago?\n\nI get home and I immediately go to my room and cry. I didn\u2019t even go downstairs after that. I hear them downstairs talking and I just get more and more angry. I get my phone and I send him a text more or so stating that this is really upsetting me, and this more or less ruined my New Year\u2019s Eve. He offered to come upstairs to talk to me about it but I didn\u2019t want to talk and just locked myself in my room. \n\nAm I overreacting? Did I  have a right to feel this way, and to tell my dad that this is bothering me, or should I just get over it? It feels too soon to move on from this, but I\u2019m not my father. I plan on moving out in a few months but I just feel like this is disrespectful as hell, considering I live there too and help with bills.\n\n*Please read the edits*\n\nEdit: I am going to talk to my dad about it soon. It was wrong of me to blow him off like that on New Year\u2019s Eve but I was just so overwhelmed since it was the first new years without my mom.\n\nEdit 2: Becky is more than a friend. I asked my dad shortly after posting this.\n\nEdit 3: I wanted to keep this post neutral for the most part so that people wouldn\u2019t just automatically paint me to be not an asshole, but, my dad has treated my mother like shit throughout their relationship. He would regularly rant about her to his friends and family and speak badly about her, and possibly to this \u2018Becky\u2019 girl as well. My mother did nothing but love and accept him and would regularly cook dinner for him and such and she did not deserve to be talked badly about or treated this way. My mother and I were planning on moving out and leaving him there but she got sick so suddenly and passed away. He\u2019s known this woman before my mom passed away as I\u2019ve seen her before. It honestly seems like he waited for my mother to pass away in order to bring this girl into our house. I don\u2019t know if any of this matters, but it very much hurts and if I\u2019m an asshole for feeling this way about it then so be it and I can be an asshole in an apartment or something where I can grieve my mom\u2019s passing alone.\n\nEdit 4: My dad brought her over again and I completely lost it, so I guess you can consider this talking about it. I started balling my eyes out and he came upstairs to talk to me. Mind you, I am sick with the flu as well. He says he doesn\u2019t want to anger me but the fact that he brings her over here and she\u2019s downstairs watching the television that I paid for and watching the cable that I pay for is fucking hurtful. He says he\u2019s sorry but I honestly think he\u2019s bluffing and I honestly do not forgive him. I\u2019m going to pack up my mom\u2019s belongings and I\u2019m going to move out of here and leave nothing of hers. That is my mother\u2019s stuff not \u201cBecky\u2019s\u201d. I come downstairs and she\u2019s eating on my mother\u2019s plates that she bought. I don\u2019t give a shit about \u201cBecky\u201d, he treated my mother like absolute garbage and he doesn\u2019t deserve an ounce of grace or sympathy. But don\u2019t worry, he\u2019ll get his fucking karma for the way he treated my mother and for what he has done to me.", "created_utc": 1673027540, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1050lj5/aita_for_going_off_on_my_dad_for_getting_a/", "score": 1974, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your feelings are honest. You lost your mom only six months ago, and the pain is still raw.\n\nBut. Your dad may have handled the situation badly - I think he did, from how you reacted - but he doesn't have to live celibate for the rest of his life, or even until you're ready for him to have a girlfriend again. \n\nMaybe it would help to go see a family therapist together, just you and him, to talk through how you both feel?", "NAH. you are both grieving. You have the right to be upset and he has the right to move on and heal even if it is a short time frame.

He could\u2019ve at least told you as much.", "NAH - How each person processes their grief is going to be different. It\u2019s normal to want people to feel the way you do. You lost your Mom, he lost his wife, those are two completely different things. It\u2019s normal for people to seek companionship after the death of a spouse. Anything to bury the universe size hole that her departure left, anything to not spend another night staring into the abyss. You can find new companions, they may not be the same and the relationship won\u2018t be the same, but it really helps the grieving to have other things in life to dwell on, even if moving on quickly isn\u2019t the healthiest choice, that\u2019s his burden to bare.\n\nBut you lost Mom. Mom can\u2018t be replaced. Sure there are stepmoms that have wonderful relationships with their kids. But it isn\u2019t the same as Mom. The better approach would be to try to empathize and understand that your Dad is just as shattered as you are. But when you both shattered your pieces fell differently and how you put yourselves back together is going to be different. Be patient with each other.\n\nSorry for your loss.", "NAH. While you don\u2019t get to tell your father how to grieve or what his grief looks like, your reaction came from an honest place of grief, shock and disappointment. Your feelings are valid, even if your reaction was emotionally driven.

I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NTA It is sad but some men can not be alone and move on quick after the death of a spouse. Two of my best friends each lost their mothers and both of their fathers got married a year later so,(not to each other , they both married other women) they started dating these women soon after the death. Both of my friends had a very hard time with this ( and i don\u2019t blame them. ). It took years for them to \u201cforgive \u201c their fathers and have a decent relationship with them again. \nDon\u2019t let anyone tell you that you are an asshole for your feelings about this. You are grieving and you never ever get over a parents death. My dad died almost 4 years ago and it still hurts everyday and side note, my mom has no desire to date ever again.

You had a knee jerk reaction,  and that is natural too, but you will be TA if you push it further. Speak to him about how you feel seeing this person and why you feel that way, and listen to him and how he feels as well.

Our brains are wired to move on from the loss of  a spouse - it's part of our biology, meant to protect us as a species.  \n\nSo, my advice is to give yourself and your dad some grace.    You are both good people trying to do their best during a difficult time.  Talk to your dad.  Tell him how you are feeling, find out how he is feeling.

It's common for men who were very happy in marriage to find in widowerhood that they are desperate to get back to being in a committed loving relationship with a partner. Being suddenly without a partner can be intensely lonely, and being sociable with a lady friend can be a way to cope with that loneliness. It doesn't mean he grieves your mom less, just that his grief is different. It doesn't mean he loved your mom less when she was alive, just that his love for a wife is different than your love of a mom. You both are in pain, and could be helping each other through a hard period. Most importantly, as a parent he could be helping you, his child, through this. If he's been a good dad up to this point, don't push him away right now. Take him up on the invitation to talk. Then suggest that the two of you spend time in family therapy and that you get a grief counselor. You are dealing with a lot of loss already. Don't wind up needlessly pushing the surviving parent away because of this awful turmoil you're feeling over loss of the first. Good luck. I'm so sorry for your loss.", "ESH you for not wanting your dad to find somebody else yet. He has a right to move on and be happy at whatever speed is right for him.

Your dad might feel lonely and want to have some fun. We also don\u2019t know what your parents\u2019 relationship was like. I had a significant other with significant health issues who passed away some years ago. We were at a point where I had been ready to end the relationship for some time but due to their health situation I didn\u2019t want to abandon them to deal with it alone. I still cared about them but if they had been healthy I would have broken up with them. I took care of them for a year and a half and was at their side until the end. We hadn\u2019t had sex in that entire time. About 4 months after they passed, I felt that I was due some fun and got myself on a dating app. Ended up meeting someone nice not long after. To outsiders it could seem like I moved on too fast, but in reality the relationship had been in trouble for quite a while before the illness, and if things had been different we would have split up long before. I\u2019m not saying that this is your dad\u2019s situation, just sharing this experience as an example of the many things people might not know from the outside looking in. \n\nYour feelings are valid and should talk to your dad about them, but understand that he may have his own way of dealing with grief. Him looking for some companionship (which may not be a serious relationship at all) doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t care about your mom, but it\u2019s totally understandable that it is painful for you to see him with someone else. \n\nNAH.

Also it's rather presumptuous of you to declare that this woman is his girlfriend and not a friend, as he introduced her to you.\n\nWhile I understand that it may have come as a shock to you, I think its just a case of bad timing. You were sick and needed a ride home and your father was presumably already with his friend. Kicking her out would have been extremely rude on his part and in such a situation there was barely any time for him to warn you.\n\nAlthough it's hard, I think you should apologise to your father and try having an open, honest conversation with him about the entire situation.", "Honestly studies show men tend to already check out when their spouse becomes ill.

I believe they started officially dating about two months after that. Anger, pain and frustration were high on my list and I also think very normal feelings. I did my best not to lash out at him and spoke with a psychologist a couple times to work through my feelings. It really helped and I would recommend it to you too - check in with your work/school and they'll probably have some sort of free service they can offer you. \n\nIt is very common for widows/widowers to jump into relationships and get married/move in together very quickly. Personally, I think it always seems strange to everyone except the widow that they're moving on so fast. But usually they're not - they've just spent a long time building a life that leans on another person to support it and when you take the other person away they feel like their life is falling down around them. So they find someone new. \n\nIt doesn't mean your dad has forgotten your mum or he's not still grieving.

It's a terrible feeling, and it's going to be with you for a long while - although the intensity will fade, and it will become much more bearable. \n\nWhat your father is going through is a very different loss. \n\nPeople expect to lose parents, eventually, but rarely expect the loss of a spouse to occur so unexpectedly. \n\nPeople only ever have one mother, but most of us have more than one dating relationship. \n\nYou're (apparently?) female, so you were socialized to be more in touch with your emotions; your father probably had pressure throughout his early life to suppress strong emotions. \n\nYou're young enough that this may be the first major loss you've experienced, and for the first loss to be so critical must be devastating to you. Your father has almost certainly experienced losses, such as grandparents, maybe parents, etc, so he has more experience with moving through the grieving process. \n\nYou're so young, death for you is mostly theoretical - you can't really see the end of your life, because it's really far away from you. Your father is at age when he can see the end of his life much more clearly than the beginning, so his concerns are very different - and probably feel more pressing. \n\nYou're also different people, so you'll react differently regardless. \n\nAll of that is to say, \"cut your father some slack, don't get ahead of the evidence, and allow yourself to grieve without making it a competition.\"", "NTA You don't bring the woman you're banging, and were likely banging before your wife was in the ground, around your grieving daughter without at least some warning and if you were out with her you pay for her uber home and go pick up your kid.", "NTA, but please talk to your dad. Was he good to your mother?", "NAH.   He should have waited or should have spoken to you before the holidays. I'm sorry for your loss.", "NTA!! Please he was probably seeing this woman way before your mom passed. Sorry for ur loss!", "NTA.\n\nThis happened to me last year. My mom had been battling breast and bone cancer for the second time. This went on for about 1.5 years. My parents unfortunately kept how sick she was until the very end. Last Thanksgiving I saw a pic of my mom on a friend's Facebook page and I called my brother because she looked absolutely horrible. At that point, my brother and I flew home to see her in late December.\n\nShe was going through dementia and my dad would only have her call us when she was having a good day. I was shocked and devastated. She had gotten to the point where she had to have someone help her walk and use the bathroom. We took her to a rehab center with the hope that someone could help her. When we dropped her off, I knew that it would the last time I saw her alive. Four days later they moved her to at home hospice care and a week later, she passed away.\n\nThree months after she passed, my dad started dating someone and the whole family knew except for me. At six months of dating, my brother insisted that he call me and let me know. I did not take it well at all. I felt that he didn't love my mother and was glad she passed away so he wouldn't have to help take care of her any more.\n\nI had very complicated feelings for a year. I then thought about it and he did take care of her for an extremely long time during both cancer bouts. Would I prefer if he had waited? Absolutely, but he deserved to be with someone who could love him and date again.\n\nI miss my mom terribly, but I'm not as angry as I was.", "YTA - it is grief talking, but still an ahole.

Judging by the replies it  seems that I am crazy but starting dating and presenting girlfriends to your kid so soon after the woman that you were married for years and had a child with died from cancer seems weird. That he is already dating is his problem tho, what is really wrong is that he presented her to you (without even talking to you about it first), did that in the worst way possible and took her to the house you share, all of that on NYE .

They may have had several  talks about what he needed to do after she was gone. Only your dad and your mom know. This puts him at a different place in the grief process than you. That is ok and not unusual. Losing a spouse and losing a parent are different grief processes as well. You and your dad may benefit from grief counseling together.  When my first husband died my mother made my grief process hellish because I was not grieving the way she thought I should, in other words, I wasn't grieving like she was.

First of all, she may actually be just a friend. Do you know for sure that your dad is seeing Becky? People grieve in different ways, and 6 months is a reasonable period of time. I get that you're going through a hard time right now, but you were still out of line. \n\nThat aside, my condolences about your mom. Do whatever you feel like you need to do to get through.", "No, dad was an asshole. You don\u2019t spring a new partner on your kids without warning, no matter how old they are or what the situation is. He can move on and that\u2019s fine, but he ambushed her with it, and that will always make him the asshole. NTA.", "This judgement is significantly more understanding to the father than is warranted. That being said I'm certain most people don't know the full story since most important details are included in ops comments. Here is a compilation of the relevant ones.\n\nThe dad was distant and uninvolved for most of ops upbringing (who is only 19), with the mother doing most of the work.\n\nThe mom was only sick for two months, so the 6 month gap can't be explained by him \"mentally grieving\" before the actual death. It was stage four pancreatic cancer and her decline was rapid. People have speculated the dad moved on faster because he had time to come to terms with the inevitable since the diagnosis... this is not the case. He had 8 months (if he just considered her dead from the moment she got sick) which doesn't make him look much better.\n\nThe \"friend\" has been confirmed as the father's girlfriend by the dad himself, so any speculation about him telling the truth about his allegedly platonic companion can also be put to an end.\n\nI think the additional info makes this a solid NTA.

Literally moved on quicker than their divorce settlement; made me seriously think he'd been cheating on my mother. (He had \"introduced\" that new relationship to me by telling me they were living together while *in the taxi on the way to visiting his new house* for the first time, like \\~6 months after my parents split, after we had just sat together on a plane for hours and spent a whole day together. Gave me approximately 5 minutes notice and zero lead time. Turns out she was also already pregnant before I knew she even existed!)

Oh no, who will clean his socks?!? He'd better find a replacement model soon! It's just not a good look.\n\nI know I'm making a rather sweeping generalization, and I'm sure some very fine men have married soon after they lost their first wife, but again, I'll repeat\u2014it's just not a good look.

When a spouse dies after a long illness, the experience is entirely different from having a spouse die in a sudden accident. The person begins morning during the illness, not after the death. Soumetimes that starts with the diagnosis. Sometimes it starts when a persons life changes, for example when the disease or treatment makes the ill person too tired to continue their normal life.\n\n2. Studies have shown that people who were in happy marriages are much quicker to seek out a new long-term relationship after the death of a spouse. The fact that your father is seeing someone  less than a year after your mother died shows that how important she was to him, and how empty his life feels without her.\n\n3. Related, this is especially true for men. Men are still, even in this day and age, not encouraged to have relationships outside of marriage. Your mother probably had several friends where she felt so emotionally close to them that she could talk about anything. Had your father died instead of your mother, she would have had a network to support her in her grief. Even today, and much more so in the past, men were not encouraged to have these types of relationships with other men. Men bond superficially with other men through sports and drinking. They don't have close, emotionally intimate friends. Men seek that kind of emotional support only from sexual partners.

However, you shouldn't feel guilty about expressing your emotional distress to your father. Just because he didn't care enough to consider your feelings and find a solution for everybody to have space to grieve on their own terms... It doesn't mean he gets to avoid hearing how wrongly he treated you.", "ESH... youre NTA for being caught off guard... BUT you dont get to set your dads timelines.... you guys need to sit down and talk... sure your dad could have given you heads up.... but evennthen you still would have felt the way you felt... everyone copes differently.... your dad is greiving too", "NAH - Everybody grieves differently, for different lengths of time, and at different intensities.  It doesn't (usually) mean they didn't care for the other, though there are of course exceptions to every general rule.  \n\nThere are so many variables that get thrown into if/when someone decides to finally move on that it can boggle the mind, but it is not unheard of for people to be afraid to be alone; swept off their feet by feelings they don't fully understand; acting on some strange combination of loneliness, fear, regret, guilt, and the last advice the departed gave them, which is commonly \"move on, dummy,\" and a slew of other things, or none of those things.  To complicate it even more, everyone's idea of true love differs based on their upbringing and experiences, and not all loves are created equal.\n\nAt the end of the day, it usually boils down to some will approve, some will not, and only the bereaved ~~really knows~~ has a snowball's chance in Hell of knowing what their real feelings are.   If you love your dad, and your dad loves you, give him the benefit of the doubt that he loved your mom too, and help him move back toward a joyful life.  Would your mom have wanted him to suffer loneliness on top of grief?", "NTA! I'm so sorry for your loss. You are grieving and have a right to how you feel.

Others have a need for companionship right away, and I\u2019ve heard it said that this indicates the previous marriage was a good one and should be considered a compliment to the deceased spouse.  Also, while six months seems like a short time, my BFF\u2019s mom was dating within TWO WEEKS after her husband of 40 years passed away. Was my friend pissed? Oh yeah. But she came to understand that life is for the living. Most of the world does not adhere to the practice of suttee (look it up if you don\u2019t know what it is).

His grandmother had been diagnosed with cancer, and shortly after finding out, his grandfather began an affair with a much younger woman.  It was discovered by my ex's dad, the entire family severed ties because what the actual f***?, yet that wasn't enough to knock sense into his grandfather.  \n\nAbout a year later, my ex's grandmother passed away.  She had found out about the affair, and if you had asked my ex and his dad, they maintained that it was the thought of being \"traded in\" that contributed to her death.\n\nYears later, my ex's dad received a phone call that his father was in a hospital in Florida and the situation looked grave.  His dad refused to visit his father and the girlfriend had effed off...somewhere.

They only knew for maybe a few weeks before she died.\n\nHe had another girlfriend within a six months.\n\nI was glad he did.\n\nI had been there during the aftermath of his wife's death, and I was so scared he wouldn't survive it. Losing his wife nearly killed him; he WANTED to die. He told me over and over again, told me to let him die. I was terrified he'd kill himself, or passively allow himself to die by neglecting his serious health issues.\n\nHe has suffered so much in his life, and then losing his wife like this, I couldn't believe one person could go through so much pain.\n\nHe loved his wife, immensely.  He was in agony after she died. \n\nI think if he hadn't found his girlfriend (a strange but lovely woman, who genuinely cares about him), he might not have survived.  And his wife would have wanted him to survive.  She would have been glad to know he was feeling joy again. \n\nHe felt guilty to feel any moments of happiness, even tiny ones, bc he felt like he was betraying her by feeling any happiness with her gone. I assured him over and over and over that as much as he loved his wife, she loved him: she would've wanted him to have happiness.\n\nHe wants to live again, and I'm so glad. His grief isn't lessened, and his love for the wife he lost isn't lessened.  I think it shows his love, to mourn her and yet continue to live - not trying to forget her, but trying to find strength and joy to keep going. \n\nHis love for his current girlfriend doesn't diminish his love for his wife, or make her somehow less wonderful or beloved. I saw him grieving; he still grieves (his girlfriend actually helps him grieve, she listens to him and speaks with him about his wife). \n\nI know I probably would feel a lot differently (and a lot more complexly!) if she had been my mother!  And if Dad's new girlfriend has been sprung on me!  And if she was brought to home we shared!

I've been there, my dad died when I was young from skin cancer and my mum moved on very quickly - much quicker than your father. I initially reacted quite poorly to this, luckily my father's father (my grandpa) was a very empathetic and wise man who helped me through my feelings (we were poor and couldn't afford therapy). Please allow me to summarise his words on this topic, they helped me then and I hope they may help you now.\n\nFirst, the grief you feel when you loose a partner and the grief you feel when you loose a parent are not the same. They filled different portions of our lives and the way we handle there passing is in response to the portion of our lives they occupied. A parent is irreplaceable, once they are gone the spot while not empty remains vacant and the memory's of their love, kindness and generosity fill that space. The most valuable part of what a parent provides is not limited to life, even in death that unlimited undefined love remains. A partner is different, we love them and they love us but the portion they occupy grows and changes throughout our life. A partners spot is much more adaptable, it has many practical components. While we love them their memory cannot satisfy (in most cases) those practical components. So once they are gone the practical portion is just empty. This makes how you grieve different.\n\nSecond, everyone grieves at different speeds. With cancer you know the death is coming, some ppl start grieving then, some ppl start grieving when death comes, some ppl shutdown completely and may not start the grieving process for years. There is no right or wrong amount of time to grieve. It unique to everyone and all we can do is respect that our process may not be there's.\n\nFinally, if we accept the above then the question becomes what we do when someone is ready to move on and we aren't. That's when you get therapy, find someone like my grandpa or if it makes you feel better (my nan use to do this) go visit the grave and tell the tomb stone how you feel - my nan swears by this method. The feeling of hurt isn't wrong nor is it unnatural but it would be wrong to punish, abuse or use this hurt against your father. He gets to move on according to his grief not yours. His grief is different because his relationship with your mother and the stop she holds in his affections is different. \n\nIt is normal to feel pain when you see ppl moving on when you have not. Do not allow that pain you are feeling to cause you to act in a way that will harm the other person who hasn't done anything wrong. Instead seek help, talk to them about your feelings in an open, non aggressive, non judgemental way. Join a support group - their are tons for children whose parents died of cancer. Try yoga (not my thing but it was recommended by my support group when I was younger). Do not sit in a black whole with your pain.", "How did it make sense that the father didn\u2019t plan to be home but then completely changed his plans just because his daughter asked for a ride home and still included the woman that she knew nothing about?

We said what we had to, in the end it was her decision (and YES she regrets it and admits now it was a mistake, but she won't divorce). I think from time dad passed till she married was 2 years or so, so not unreasonable especially at her age- they don't have years and years to spare -but yes we struggled with it as reasonable adults and we had dads diagnosis for almost 2 yrs before he passed- so we had a lot longer time to process his death even prior, as did my mom.\n\nAnd yeah, I know it seems the case with men especially, some can move on with lightning speed- I think it's honestly one of the ways they grieve, and most men, especially men married for many years simply SUCK at being alone and can't hack it....so they find the next 'wife' to take care of them. Dating and endorphins from a new relationship also feel good -it's a chemical high, and it can certainly help you feel better if you are depressed and in deep grief.  It seems disloyal to your moms memory though, I get it- but it really isn't.  He was married to her when she passed?  He fulfilled his vows-but yeah it has to hurt. \n\nI remember the case of some friends of mine- these 3 young boys mother died in a horrific freak accident -they were teens/young adults- oldest probably early 20's....the dad remarried their moms best friend within months,  it really hurt them. Yada yada- shared grief, I get it- but in this case I think the moms best friend and their dad should have known better and given those boys time to process ffs,\n\nMy paternal grandfather apparently also remarried 6 months after grandma died (she died in her 60's)- and my dad/siblings all adults always resented her and were hurt their dad moved on so quickly.  \n\nFeelings are valid, grief can do some pretty strange things....so just know this, your grief is valid, but he grieves in his own way and it does NOT mean he didn't love your mom enough if he doesn't grieve for a longer period of time.  If anything they often date to mask and ignore their pain and grieving...which typically just ends up backfiring as it delays- and then the new woman ends up being the one to pick up the broken pieces or get a super messed up partner that can't give them what they receive kwim?", "Our neighbour\u2019s wife was dead a couple of weeks after her unexpected diagnosis. He was remarried within 6 months. They had been together for many decades. I found it shocking.", "For many men, a woman is an appliance that they can't live without. From what OP says about their father mistreating their mom, it looks like he's one of those. It's harder for men to live without their handy appliance than for women to live without being one.", "Edit: the edits added to this post completely change the story. There is so much more going on here than your dad going out with a woman 6 months after your mum's death. I think in your effort to be neutral you left out that your anger is not really about this one incident. It is about a whole history of how he treated your mum and you. Your dad isn't an arsehole for going out with a woman 6 months after your mum's death, he is an arsehole for being an awful, abusive husband and father and that's what you need to address. \n\nIf possible I would look at moving out as soon as you can and getting some serious therapy to help you work through it all.", "You described my feelings so well and you're right, most of these people commenting don't understand that. I'm sorry for the loss of your sister and hope your state of mind is better than before.", "I don\u2019t think my father truly loved my mother, but she loved him unconditionally despite the emotional abuse. He regularly would talk shit about her to friends and family. This new woman was around long before my mother passed away.", "I get that, I really do, but the child/children are also grieving and it\u2019s the parent\u2019s responsibility to take care of them as much as possible, even to prioritize them - a compromise would have been for the dad to date out of the house and not subject the son to that if he was not ready. It doesn\u2019t sound like the dad even cares at all since she\u2019s still at the house constantly since that day.", "Because she was sick.", "NTA dude please don\u2019t listen to the N A H comments, they\u2019re showing way too much sympathy to your dad. I\u2019m in college, probably about your age, and I know that if I lost my mom right now, it would destroy me. I can\u2019t imagine mourning the loss of my mother on a holiday that we spent together last year only for my dad to spring his new gf on me. That\u2019s beyond horrible. You handled it well honestly, I might have screamed at both of them", "After reading your edits, you are definitely NTA. This has nothing to do with you \u201ccontrolling\u201d how he grieves but a direct response not only to your pain but his mistreatment of your mother. It\u2019s obviously possible he\u2019s still grieving her but in combination with the backstory you\u2019ve given, it puts a helluva asterisk beside it imo. Baba mi\u2026", "NTA dad\u2019s being disrespectful bringing Becky around you when you\u2019re uncomfortable with her", "Yeah I don\u2019t want this lady around me and frankly I don\u2019t want my dad around me either anymore. I thought I was healing my relationship with him but then he brings this woman back to the place. I shouldn\u2019t have omitted the information I provided in the edits but I wanted to keep the post neutral.", "Oh shut up. You\u2019re so fucking wrong. It\u2019s sick.", "Yeah I don\u2019t wanna be trapped in a car with some mistress while I\u2019m sick as a dog and be forced to talk to this woman idgaf. Then he brings her back and has her use my mom\u2019s belongings.", "Or Op  could\u2019ve called an Uber/taxi?", "Ugh, yeah, you're right.  Sorry, all.", "It is shocking to see, but this happens more to people in good marriages than unhappy ones. \n\nIt isn\u2019t because they\u2019re looking for a replacement but more that having had a strong marriage, they value partnership and the benefits of it - and consequently feel more alone and uncomfortable without it. \n\nI think I would move on reasonably quickly. I adore my husband but he\u2019s much more to me than just my husband - he\u2019s also my best friend, my hugger, my lover, my source of comfort, the person whose steady breathing reassures me in the night. I need those things in my life. Having to grieve him would be hard enough, but being expected not to have anyone fill those roles in my life while grieving him and our life together would be beyond painful. \n\nMy children only get one Dad, but no one thinks that in your whole life you should only have one best friend, or dinner partner, or cinema buddy, or sexual relationship - until you\u2019re widowed. THEN it\u2019s shocking."]}
