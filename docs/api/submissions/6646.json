My mom was always there for me and we spent so much time together. Her death was unexpected and fast. It blindsided me and I haven\u2019t been the same since then. \n\nMy dad and I haven\u2019t been close at all really, but I\u2019m staying with him while I search for a place to move out. I\u2019ve been helping him with bills such as rent snd utilities. However, what he did on New Year\u2019s Eve really caught me off guard. \n\nI had my dad come and pick me up from work since I was feeling sick and didn\u2019t feel comfortable driving home. When I walked to the car, this woman was in the car. I just stood there in shock. Let\u2019s call her Becky. He says, \u201cthis is Becky. She\u2019s \u2018just a friend\u2019 (yeah right)\u201d I say \u201chello\u201d, and look out the window because I was trying to mentally process everything. He keeps trying to get me to talk but I don\u2019t want to. You\u2019re just gonna bring this random woman you\u2019re seeing back to the place after my mom passed not even a year ago?\n\nI get home and I immediately go to my room and cry. I didn\u2019t even go downstairs after that. I hear them downstairs talking and I just get more and more angry. I get my phone and I send him a text more or so stating that this is really upsetting me, and this more or less ruined my New Year\u2019s Eve. He offered to come upstairs to talk to me about it but I didn\u2019t want to talk and just locked myself in my room. \n\nAm I overreacting? Did I  have a right to feel this way, and to tell my dad that this is bothering me, or should I just get over it? It feels too soon to move on from this, but I\u2019m not my father. I plan on moving out in a few months but I just feel like this is disrespectful as hell, considering I live there too and help with bills.", "created_utc": 1673027540, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1050lj5/aita_for_going_off_on_my_dad_for_getting_a/", "score": 218, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your feelings are honest. You lost your mom only six months ago, and the pain is still raw.\n\nBut. Your dad may have handled the situation badly - I think he did, from how you reacted - but he doesn't have to live celibate for the rest of his life, or even until you're ready for him to have a girlfriend again. \n\nMaybe it would help to go see a family therapist together, just you and him, to talk through how you both feel?", "NAH. you are both grieving. You have the right to be upset and he has the right to move on and heal even if it is a short time frame. But I will say that bringing her unannounced and expecting you to immediately be okay with it is a dick move. He could\u2019ve at least told you as much.", "NAH - How each person processes their grief is going to be different. It\u2019s normal to want people to feel the way you do. You lost your Mom, he lost his wife, those are two completely different things. It\u2019s normal for people to seek companionship after the death of a spouse. Anything to bury the universe size hole that her departure left, anything to not spend another night staring into the abyss. You can find new companions, they may not be the same and the relationship won\u2018t be the same, but it really helps the grieving to have other things in life to dwell on, even if moving on quickly isn\u2019t the healthiest choice, that\u2019s his burden to bare.\n\nBut you lost Mom. Mom can\u2018t be replaced. Sure there are stepmoms that have wonderful relationships with their kids. But it isn\u2019t the same as Mom. The better approach would be to try to empathize and understand that your Dad is just as shattered as you are. But when you both shattered your pieces fell differently and how you put yourselves back together is going to be different. Be patient with each other.\n\nSorry for your loss.", "NAH. While you don\u2019t get to tell your father how to grieve or what his grief looks like, your reaction came from an honest place of grief, shock and disappointment. Your feelings are valid, even if your reaction was emotionally driven. Apologize to him for the way you responded, be honest about why you had those big feelings, and resolve to him and yourself that you\u2019ll find better ways to communicate and cope. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "NTA It is sad but some men can not be alone and move on quick after the death of a spouse. Two of my best friends each lost their mothers and both of their fathers got married a year later so,(not to each other , they both married other women) they started dating these women soon after the death. Both of my friends had a very hard time with this ( and i don\u2019t blame them. ). It took years for them to \u201cforgive \u201c their fathers and have a decent relationship with them again. \nDon\u2019t let anyone tell you that you are an asshole for your feelings about this. You are grieving and you never ever get over a parents death. My dad died almost 4 years ago and it still hurts everyday and side note, my mom has no desire to date ever again. She said \u201conce you\u2019ve had the best no need to try again. \u201c.", "NAH, I think you are mad that his grieving process is different than yours. I am so very sorry for your loss. I think you are both at two different stages. I don't know if 6 months is enough for me, but it may he for him. He is not being disrespectful by introducing his new friend. You had a knee jerk reaction,  and that is natural too, but you will be TA if you push it further. Speak to him about how you feel seeing this person and why you feel that way, and listen to him and how he feels as well.

Your dad deserves friendship, companionship, a hug and a shoulder.  He has needs that you alone can not meet.

Just because he met someone else and is trying to move on does not diminish in any way his love that he feels for your mom.", " NTA. I personally feel that is quick since it\u2019s not just when your mom passed but from when she was diagnosed. I would be upset if my dad moved on that quick honestly. But I also recognize that everyone grieves differently and this may be how your dad copes and he has the right to make that choice. I think for me the biggest issue is there was no discussion or heads up. A conversation about how he\u2019s going out with a friend or met someone or wanted to invite someone over who\u2019s special to him etc. I do think it was wrong for him to allow you to be blindsided.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss.

I still needed my mom so much at that age.  I'm sure you do too, so her loss is that much more difficult for you.  \n\nYour dad is grieving too - in a different way because he is a different person and his relationship to your mom was different.  You only get one mom and nothing can replace that relationship.  Once your mom is gone, she is gone - the loss is profound.

Our brains are wired to move on from the loss of  a spouse - it's part of our biology, meant to protect us as a species.  \n\nSo, my advice is to give yourself and your dad some grace.    You are both good people trying to do their best during a difficult time.  Talk to your dad.  Tell him how you are feeling, find out how he is feeling.

Your dad might feel lonely and want to have some fun. We also don\u2019t know what your parents\u2019 relationship was like. I had a significant other with significant health issues who passed away some years ago. We were at a point where I had been ready to end the relationship for some time but due to their health situation I didn\u2019t want to abandon them to deal with it alone. I still cared about them but if they had been healthy I would have broken up with them. I took care of them for a year and a half and was at their side until the end. We hadn\u2019t had sex in that entire time. About 4 months after they passed, I felt that I was due some fun and got myself on a dating app. Ended up meeting someone nice not long after. To outsiders it could seem like I moved on too fast, but in reality the relationship had been in trouble for quite a while before the illness, and if things had been different we would have split up long before. I\u2019m not saying that this is your dad\u2019s situation, just sharing this experience as an example of the many things people might not know from the outside looking in. \n\nYour feelings are valid and should talk to your dad about them, but understand that he may have his own way of dealing with grief. Him looking for some companionship (which may not be a serious relationship at all) doesn\u2019t mean he didn\u2019t care about your mom, but it\u2019s totally understandable that it is painful for you to see him with someone else. \n\nNAH.

Why in the world would this be toxic when this is absolutely a situation to worry about? Her father basically sprung a stranger on her, not to mention she doesn't have a good relationship with her father either, I'm going by what she said. So she should take what she wants to remember her mother by when she moves.", "I'm just going by the worst case scenario, we've seen way too many posts here on Reddit from people who never saw things belonging to their deceased parents when the surviving one moves on.

I just didn't want her to take a chance and get hurt brutally if her father chooses to move on and pretend the past didn't happen...how often have we seen posts of grieving spouses making terrible choices because their judgment is impaired by vulnerability, especially regarding children from previous relationships or items or inheritance? And by the time they realize, the damage is already done. If OP wants to have a relationship with her dad, then sure. Only she truly knows how the situation is.

But your *continued* attitude toward this isn\u2019t excusable just because you\u2019re grieving. You can *absolutely* be upset that dad is seeing someone, and some initial surprise and distress is valid. But you don\u2019t get to *blame* him for seeing someone. The fact that you say in another comment that after you move out, you likely won\u2019t speak to your father for a long time because of this\u2026that\u2019s problematic.

He didn\u2019t *impose* this woman on you, he didn\u2019t move her into the house or anything like that. You met her unexpectedly, presumably for everyone.

You\u2019re not 12; you are well old enough to have a grown-up conversation, even if it\u2019s uncomfortable for both of you. And part of that discomfort is that you need to understand it is incredibly common for people\u2014especially men\u2014to seek out new relationships quickly. With long terminal illnesses like cancer, the grieving process doesn\u2019t begin at death, it begins long before that. A married person often loses the partner they once had long before the person passes away. They are forced to begin conceptualizing life without that person.

You don\u2019t get to tell him he shouldn\u2019t bring this woman into the house, especially when you weren\u2019t home and weren\u2019t expected home. You are behaving like this was a personal, deliberate slight toward you. It\u2019s okay to be surprised or upset, but this hostility toward dad about the situation is where you\u2019re out of line. You are making all of this\u2014in your OP and your comments\u2014all about you, your demands, and your judgment on what dad should or shouldn\u2019t be doing. You pay lip service in a few comments about how you know you can\u2019t tell dad how to grieve or move forward, but you obviously don\u2019t mean it.

I don\u2019t believe you\u2019d handle it better if he let you know that she was waiting back at the house for him.", "Hindsight is 20/20. Maybe he wasn't ready to have that talk with her. Maybe he wasn't even sure what he was doing yet? We can armchair quarterback this whole thing to no end. It just sounds like bad timing to me.", "OP stated that they would have preferred to be given warning so they could have time to process the shock. Saying that potentially we would just be dealing with OP being mad about a text and it\u2019s a lose-lose isn\u2019t the case. OP might have still been mad but wouldn\u2019t have been forced to process their shock in front of the woman. Their father acted thoughtlessly"]}
