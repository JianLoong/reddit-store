It's 2023, if people don't know by now that only the bride (or person getting married, or whatever you know what I mean don't come for me pronoun police) is the one wearing the white dress then you don't belong at a wedding in 2023.  Well done Maid of Honor!", "NTA, but you're supposed to make it look like an accident.", "NTA You even warned her right before doing it, giving her one more chance to be decent.

You're badass.", "NTA.

Who cares what other people think it's not your family", "NTA. You did what the MOH is supposed to do - take any displeasure on yourself that the bride doesn\u2019t want to or can\u2019t. Let\u2019s face it - you have no skin in the game in the relationship with MIL, so you could pull a stunt like that and get away with it. The bride, not so much.\n\nAnd, let\u2019s face it - MIL sent her family after you because she is now afraid of you because she knows you don\u2019t mess around.
