In the interim my now husband told me he would fully support us financially and do whatever he needed to do to help my mental state as it was not in the best place for many reasons. Even with my medication, I was still so depressed and riddled with anxiety but eventually I pulled through. I sat down with him and thanked him for supporting me and loving me unconditionally through this difficult season. I started working full time again and felt better and everything sort of fell into place. For me personally, I had to thank him because I didn\u2019t want him to think I was taking advantage of him. I was so grateful he helped me (and my family). I feel like your gf is taking advantage of you.

I completely would have snapped at her if she made a rude comment about my cooking abilities when she doesn\u2019t even try. \nI would have a conversation with her and figure out a new plan. It is exhausting you and you are being more than accommodating for her. Does she need to switch therapists again? Does she need a job? What can you do to help encourage her to do things?

How do you not know what treatment your GF is having? Why is there so little mentioned about what's been going on in the last year and a half other than generalizations? What conversations have you actually had to communicate what you both need out of the relationship, and what chores she *can* do?\n\nMental health is no joke, and it sounds like you've been potentially just coasting and enabling her behavior before just snapping at her.

As someone who\u2019s dealt with depression to the extent she did at some point you gotta put your big girl (or in my case guy) pants on and get yourself back together to at least be a functioning human. Depression may never leave but that doesn\u2019t mean your life should stop because of it. However I don\u2019t think you should leave. Having someone there to help you when you\u2019re going through your hardest depression seasons makes you remember that life is worth living and there are few people who care. Mine was my dad.

But at this point it looks like she has stopped and even is blaming things on you, not good at all. I think she might need a reality check, you are completely right about responsibilities, not having them makes depression worse so what she needs to do is start with handling small tasks and then building it up.
