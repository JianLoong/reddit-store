They should have added on or moved into a bigger place. They should not be expecting you to give up your bedroom for the basement.

And logically it's not reasonable to expect that your brother stays in his parents' bedroom for much longer, nor is it feasible to move him to the basement or outside. So... You're going to lose the room whether you want that or not. You don't really have a lot of control over it. That's definitely something that sucks about being a minor and living in your parents house. \n\nSo you need to focus on what you do have control over. It seems to me there might be room for negotiation. Maybe they'd agree to doing some light renovations to the basement so it is nicer. Maybe they'd even look into installing a bathroom down there (no idea what the architectural or financial feasibility of that is). Or maybe some new furniture, or other gifts to help the transition. Again I'm not sure what's feasible, but it seems to me that cooperation might go better than a battle you are certain to lose.", "Definitely NTA. Your parents decided to have another child. You did not. I get that the basement or backyard is obviously no place to keep a toddler, but it isn't a place for a 16 year old either. They should have thought out their living situation more seriously before having another child. It's ridiculous of them to expect you to bear the burden of them having a kid. I know that many parents would sooner have moved into the living room or basement themselves than make their kids live in the basement. It's worrying that yours would expect you to do that.", "If you live with your dad full time NTA.

I am sure you are all around a delight to live with.", "This is going to get downvoted but YTA, mainly because of the entitled attitude in the post. You don\u2019t need an en-suite. You don\u2019t need a view. You don\u2019t need to say things like they could put the baby in the backyard for all you care. \n\nAssuming the basement has appropriate exit plans to be a bedroom - you still cannot have a toddler live there. This wasn\u2019t an unrealistic ask on their end. It is an inconvenient ask for you and you do have the right to be irritated. \n\nShould they have planned better? Sure. Not every pregnancy is planned. The housing market is also insane so moving may not be an option. \n\nIf the basement does not have exit strategies in place then you should not relocate. You should point out that it\u2019s a safety hazard and stay put. Safety hazard should be your reasoning, not a lack of bathroom and view.", "YTA  It's THEIR house.  Not yours.  They let you use a bedroom in their house.  You are certainly welcome to be annoyed at the situation, but ultimately, it's their house and  their decision.", "Sorry but YTA - it\u2019s not YOURS unless you are paying a mortgage on the house.

It\u2019s reasonable for them to want to have the 2 year old near them, bedroom wise. You are older and don\u2019t need the same proximity a two year old does.

Like \u201chey Sarah why don\u2019t we go shopping and buy you a bunch of new stuff to finish out the basement and make it your own space.\u201d I\u2019ve found with my 15yo that the way you word things, the perspective you show when presenting an idea makes a difference. Just being rude and saying you have to move so we can have your room is insensitive and dismissive. Give your sibling the room and take the freedom having a basement bedroom will give. Have them get you a mini fridge and set it up like a little apartment. Ask about adding a small 1/2 bath downstairs. As a teen you need ready access to a toilet and sink. They want your room make them work for it.", "NTA. It wasn't you who decided to have a baby when you obviously don't have enough room for him. I don't know if it's even legal for you to live in the basement, but you could try to find it out in case they try to force you.

But in proportion your father and step mom are way bigger AH: it wouldn't be fair to say that everyone suck considering that they are doing way worse and 1) they are adults 2) the situation is entirely on them.\n\nYou see, this is what I mean with \"parents should actually have conversations with their children before moving in new partners and children and don't start with plans without even discussing it\". Some parents pretend to play happy big family and then they don't have the emotional and financial resources to back it up. And the older children are the ones who pay the price, as it happens in most families.\n\nLike... Tell me how a young girl should feel when she is put in the basement and the others (2 of them not relatives for her) play happy family upstairs in the actual house... It isn't fair. Adults should know better if they want to be parents. There are some basic dynamics to avoid.\n\nMy suggestion: try to insist for them to keep the youngest in their bedroom until he is 4-5 yo. It would be the most reasonable thing.", "NTA\nOp, I have questions. where has this two year old been sleeping before now? So they have a long term plan for you and this baby staying in this house? What is your custody situation with your parents? If she's around, have you talked to your mother about this arrangement?\nI assume you calling her \"his wife\" indicates that you don't have a good relationship with her.

I got moved to the basement when I still lived with my parents. Granted, I'm a huge introvert, so I loved the privacy. However, having a 2 year old live in the basement is unreasonable. The attitude doesn't help your case.\n\nThey should have had this planned out a long time ago. Their poor planning is not your fault. He's 2 years old by now.

Absolutely it does. But despite your claim, it really isn't your room as in you own it. When you are an adult and live on your own, then you can call the shots.

Like why make everyone\u2019s life more difficult with entitlement and what you deem to be sarcasm\n\nEdit: leave in 2 years, but in the mean time why make everyone\u2019s life harder?", "A sixteen year old and a two year old can, of course, share a bedroom but it\u2019s gonna end up being the 2 year old\u2019s room due to schedule differences like naptimes and bedtimes since no 16-year old is going to share a bedtime with a toddler. OP\u2019s parents should have thought out their space needs a lot better and a lot earlier here if the basement isn\u2019t legal as a bedroom.", "Lol I shared my bathroom with a family of four for my entire life. OP will live.", "The situation certainly sucks.  However, your suggestion is just as unreasonable as OP's.  It's the same issue.  Toddler should be closer to the parents.  \n\n\nAlso, the loss of the bathroom isn't a great argument to me.  I grew up in a family of 4 in a small house with 1 bathroom.  No one had an en-suite.  We survived just fine.  It sucks to lose it when you had it, but it's by no means a necessity.", "Lol oh no, she wouldn\u2019t have her own bathroom anymore? How would she ever survive?", "This still puts the toddler and the parents on different levels of the house far away from each other. You think the 16 year old is gonna do anything to help him out if he needs something I\u2019m the middle of the night? Nah, they\u2019ll be on here again inn two months like \u201cAm I the asshole for letting their child lay on the floor crying after he fell out of his crib and cracked his head open?\u201d", "She can just keep the bathroom though. Like, she'll have to walk upstairs, but the parents can still say it's her bathroom and agree to not use it. 2 year old obviously doesn't need a bathroom.", "This is the answer. Negotiate a sweet setup.", "The one that seems to be a fire hazard?", "Having enough space for all the children should. If you have to kick one kid out of a room and put them in a basement with no windows, you shouldn\u2019t be reproducing anymore.", "Doesn't mean you aren't an arse for sandling your kids with your bad decisions.", "But parents' common sense should", "If it directly fucks them over, yeaah they probably should have a say.", "Maybe so. But generally not with a 14 year age difference for one. Two, they\u2019re different genders. She referred to her sibling as a \u201chim\u201d and that creates it\u2019s own problem in itself. \nAnd third, that\u2019s not the problem here. They didn\u2019t ask her to share her bedroom with her sibling. They want her to move out of it.", "But it is her half-brother because it\u2019s her dads child", "Op said she is her mother but she refuses to call her mom because she made s comment about \"finally having a son\"", "Just because her dad's wife isn't her mom, doesn't mean that isn't her little brother. That's not how it works.", ">\u201cwell it\u2019s such a large age gap, of course they don\u2019t care for the younger sibling.\u201d\n\nI agree this is absolute bullshit\n\nI have a big age gap too, hes just turned 19, and im 10 years older, we are about as close as it gets, not sure we could be closer even if we were twins.", "Great question, friend! I\u2019m wondering if they want to put her in the basement because she might hurt the baby. Her word choices in her comments referring to her biological mom as \u201cdad\u2019s wife\u201d and brother (he\u2019s not even her half brother!) as \u201ctheir child\u201d indicates she doesn\u2019t see her mother and brother as family. Additional comments with morbid humor about the baby indicate to me that OP could be a potential danger to her brother. She can claim ownership of some people and things \u201cmy dad\u201d, \u201cmy room\u201d, but coldly disregard her mother and brother.", "Thank you. All these folks must be rich. Also I grew up in an environment where the child doesn't make the decisions.  I also moved out at 18.", "[deleted]", "I see that ultimately happening, whether OP likes it or not.", "That seems so common to see people using a basement as room though. If the room is ventilated and not too bad of course.\n\nI've once rented an hotel room with no window. Good discount ! Just for one night sleep it was OK but I wouldn't spend a week indeed.", "My parents let my aunt stay in my bed until I come home for breaks. Sure it\u2019s my room but it\u2019s been completely rearranged by her and I\u2019ve had her stuff all of my shit into a tiny corner in the closet. I\u2019m looking forward to when I have an apartment next year and can just stay there instead\ud83d\udc80", "Think about them and not you, you\u2019re growing up, you want to live in that room forever?", "I had to do a room swap when my daughter decided to move in with her dad. My youngest was in a tiny room with not a ton of privacy (first floor, off the dining room vs upstairs). I gave my daughter a few months to decide how often she'd be going back and forth, but honestly, the kid who's there more should get the bigger room. So they swapped. She was a little grumpy about it, but she had made the choice to move out. The smaller room is now hers when she wants it, but otherwise it's a guest room/office. She'll always have space here, just maybe not the exact space she wants.", "If that's even possible.  A lot of times it's not.", "Or even other things like if the parent wants a hobby room or office.", "Op was 14 when the baby was born, a good chance 13 while step mom was preggo.  Who knows how long before that they decided to have a baby. Maybe she got supper lucky and got pregnant right away. Maybe it took a year.  So yes, when one kid is *13* a parent does need to think about space.  They've had literal years to find a solution other than kick OP out of her room.  They could added a bathroom downstairs, they'd HAVE to add an egress window at the very least.", "They got pregnant when they had a 14 year old under their roof, and instead of finding a bigger home, their long term plan was essentially to pressure the older kid to live in a basement and the fuck off to college and not come back. They\u2019re either not worth having in OP\u2019s life or so broke that they aren\u2019t going to be able to provide any meaningful financial support anyway. Or both.", "the problem with one sided story.\n\nAll of her comment just clearly showing what type of person she is.", "That's exactly the two options I would've given her, either you're sharing a room with your brother or you're moving to a different room. She doesn't appear to even care about the room so much as she cares about making her stepmom and baby brother's life difficult and punishing Daddy for not recognizing her as the center of his universe.", "She is 16. She can't leave. Even if she is the AH, her parents have to deal with her until she is 18. She's NTA in my opinion. Her dad & stepmother are definitely TA. They can keep the baby sleeping in their room for another few years, turn the basement into a playroom for the daytime. These are the sacrifices you make when you have a small house.", "they should plan ahead but they did not. Happens. It is pointless to discuss what they should do. The situation is what it is.\n\nHer parents can be AH but her behavior (post, comments) is just telling what kind of entitled teenager she is. I would love to see AITA post from her father. Would be interesting", "LOL! Grew up with 5 people (3 girls & my parents) with 1 bathroom... Have 4 kids, my husband & myself we have 3 bathrooms .... whenever my sons complained about their sisters taking too long in their bathroom my husband would say \u201cyour grandfather survived with 4 women & 1 bathroom. So shut it\u201d", "Come on. \n\nI give it 2 days before all the 2 year old\u2019s bath toys are in the bathtub and his potty seat is in there. It will definitely become a toddler bathroom.", "The only people who get to decide if a child is born is the parent(s). Not the father if the mother wants to continue a pregnancy he does not want. Not the parent of a teenager who does not want their minor child to have a child. Not the child of the parent who doesn't want to be inconvenienced by a sibling. Body autonomy and reproductive freedom are non-negotiable even if others don't like the consequences.", "But OP also doesn't have to care.", "It's a little half-brother.", "That\u2019s how I feel with my younger sis. Even now that I\u2019m not living at home, we\u2019re still really close and love spending time together. It makes me sad to see broken sibling relationships that are the cause of adults who couldn\u2019t figure out how to balance more than one child.", "I especially like how ppl were encouraging an entitled Ass teenager until they read their comments, wherein amongst other things they repeatedly refer to their mom as their dad\u2019s wife and say derogatory things about a baby. \n\nIt sounds like there\u2019s a roof, food, clothes, and they\u2019re not abusing their kids. OP is given safety and an education. Nobody\u2019s entitled to pick their bedroom as a kid , not even entitled to a room by themselves, and certainly not entitled to a fucking en-suite.", "Toddlers needs are the parent\u2019s issues, not the siblings. Since we don\u2019t know the layout of the basement and what it entails, it could very well be inappropriate to use as a bedroom. I don\u2019t blame OP one bit for resenting everyone in that household for showing the blatant favoritism that they are.", "Poor OP. That's really unfair.", "How many times have you opened a window at a hotel? This is a psychological thing.", "Yeah I know. I'm thinking about taking advantage of the 12 month lease I'm going to be stuck paying next school year and make something productive of myself at uni. Still sucks that all my step, half, and siblings have their own room regardless of whether they are studying in town or not. I understand things go that way and am grateful to at least have a roof and food. But I do miss not having shuffle through my suitcase for clothes and the other things that come with a private room.", "It's not difficult on most homes, but there are a few exceptions.  Mostly if it's a row house and the HOA doesn't allow it.  Otherwise you just have to spend a few days getting all the proper permits together, do a lot of digging, and build a staircase and door.", "It\u2019s his mom not stepmom. I\u2019m not sure this was planned given the age gap.", "I was going to say N TA but after reading the rest of her comments...OP must be the kind of insufferable teen that makes her parents pray for the day she goes to college.", "Not even stepmom. Those are her bio parents.", "or the child can move in with their sibling. kids are not entitled to their own room", "4 girls, my mom and my dad shared one bathroom for about twenty years; trust me I get it \ud83d\ude06", "It would become that, and that's okay.... Toddler needs it more than OP...", "Of course, but that would also make them an asshole.", "[deleted]", "I think it's mostly for the view and daylight indeed.", "Every time? I like to air the room out before I spend a bunch of time in it.", "OP doesn\u2019t seem to care at all what they do with the toddler, so long as they don\u2019t make it her problem to solve which they\u2019re obviously trying to do. She didn\u2019t decide to have another kid they weren\u2019t prepared to accommodate for, it\u2019s not her problem. Making her give up the room she\u2019s still growing up in and is accustomed to is absolutely favoritism."]}
