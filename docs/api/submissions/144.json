My mom (50F) has been cheating on my dad (52M) for 2 years and my dad is very materialistic. My mother always says she will never be proud of me and when we argue she calls me a bitch and ungrateful, etc. She always tries playing victim even when I caught her cheating on my dad. I got accepted to college across the states so i\u2019m leaving for a different state in less than a week and I told my mom the day she was going to Europe which led to her telling everyone in the family and people started saying im making a mistake and i feel no one is supporting me. I admit its not the best time to tell a family member that youre leaving a week after they leave but I am very tired of living here and they wont even allow me to work.

You set it up the way you did to avoid drama. There is little time remaining to have to deal with assignations and recriminations. So, you've executed your plan well. I wish you all best OP. Enjoy school and a calmer daily experience. NTA.", "NTA, great for you. Focus on your future", "NTA. I bet the other people don\u2019t know how poorly your mom treats you. They probably think that she\u2019s fantastic. \n\nDO NOT let the opinions of others keep you from growing, maturing, getting your education and living a happier, healthy, independent life.", "NTA. Get OUT of there! Your mom shouldn't be making you feel like you have to THANK HER for providing you basic necessities required by law. Yes, you probably could have told her sooner, but if you did, she probably would be trying harder to guilt trip you into staying. What's ahead of you is going to be a long, hard journey, but it will be very worth it.", "NTA.  You've told your family you're leaving.  You could have packed up and snuck out and left them wondering.\n\nYour home environment sounds very, very hard.  Not being allowed to work at 18 yo? I had my kids in jobs at 15, bc you need work experience!\n\nAre you supported by scholarships?  Do you expect Mom & Dad to pay tuition?  Do you plan to return over the holidays when schools often close the dormitories?\n\nI completely support your choice to leave, but I also hope you have thought this through.\n\nEDIT: I agree with the earlier commenter.  Living well is the best revenge.", "Best of luck to you with college and a life of your very own making. Congrats on getting into the college you wanted. I have a few questions. \n\n1. Who is paying for College?\n2. Who is paying for your room and board?\n3. Why do you care what others think of you when you come from toxicity?\n\nNTA but if you are living off them then I would be a bit more considerate, a bit. Other than that why don't you go, just go do great at college and in your chosen career choice. The best way to give them all the finger is to have a great life in spite of them.

You\u2019re an adult and you have the right to move. You can\u2019t expect people to support you when you tell them on their way to another country that you\u2019re moving across the country. You should have been an adult and talked to them when they weren\u2019t about to fly out of the country. They sound like assholes, but it\u2019s shitty to tell someone on their way to vacation that you\u2019re moving.", "I have been begging to work since 15 so i could start paying for my own stuff and getting the experience i need but the response was always \u201cno i can pay for whatever you want so you arent working.\u201d I dont want my parents to help with my tuition due to the fact that they always bring up how they pay for everything and how they\u2019re the ones paying for my food and my basic need. Its a law to give me even the basics. So i don\u2019t want them to use, paying tuition for me, against me. And yes i do plan to come on holidays, and my sister which i very much love, is pregnant so i will also be making a trip here in order to see my niece/nephew. I would be living with my friend that i\u2019ve know for years and years, and i know while it might not be the best, it will give me a chance to get on my feet until i get my own apartment.", "I will be paying my student loans because i don\u2019t want to live off of them when they always use everything against me. I will be living with my friend and its not that i care what others think but i want others to understand in the reason why im leaving at a *young age.* I always got told growing up that i shouldn\u2019t leave when i turn 18 because im not mature enough to make my own decisions and i have *no idea what the real world is like.* I want to make my own experiences and if i make a mistake in the process, so be it. After all i am a human.", "i wish she left for vacation but she went to visit her boyfriend whilst leaving my dad here and lying saying shes going to sell an apartment. but i understand what youre saying", "Brave and wonderful human. They have taught you what shitheads are and, you have taken the best from that and chosen to reject their obligations. Big Grandma Hugs Dearest. You are awesome!", "Talk to a college advisor about whether you can be considered emancipated financially from your parents in order to be eligible for more aid and Pell Grants for next semester or year. You basically fled from your parents' house. \n\nAnd definitely take advantage of campus counseling to learn to use your new freedom well!", "Thank you so much! And a question for you, my sister wants me to share my location with her 24/7 so she knows im *safe* but when she left the house she didnt share her location and she also blames me for not texting her when a phone works both ways. she can easily text me to check up on me and she doesn\u2019t. So my question is should i tell her i dont think its fair to share my location or should i just share it? And thank you for believing in me! I have felt like shit these past few days because of everyone else so your kind words mean a lot to me.", "Well, we have a two-edged sword here with your sister. On one hand, your sister has the hindsight to know that at times she wished someone knew where she was at. We all get into a silly situation or two while we are learning the ropes of life. You might want to have someone in your family keep tabs to know you are safe, or....you might not. If the other side of the sword is that your sister keeps not only a safety eye on you but also tells mommy and daddy every friggin place you go. Only you know what would be best. Think long and hard about it. You could also agree to text dear sister every morning at let us say, 7am with a \"Hi, I still love you always\" text. You are now completely in control of what goes on for you. Big job but life can be so wonderful. I left home days before my 17th Bday because life was hell at my house. It hasn't always been easy but it has been a wonderful life and wonderful family I have made for me and mine. Every day you are above the grass is a good day. I wish I could help you more. You sound like you will be just grand. Hugs", "Don\u2019t share your location, because there\u2019s always a chance your parents will get their hand on that info. \nLive your best life and spread your wings. Lots of us didn\u2019t know how the world works and figured it anyway."]}
