At no point ever does a 16 year old child need to be \"understanding\" of a grown man who is literally verbally abusing him. Maybe you, like his Mom, missed the part where he was yelling insults at a minor or just come from a generation where that was \"normal\" and socially acceptable. We are no longer in the time where it's just okay to abuse children and people of EVERY generation need to learn to live with it. He does not deserve understanding for his bigotry and abuse and we, as a society, need to stop coddling these people at the expense of our children. Being old does not give a person the right to be abusive or somehow make their feelings more important. Teenagers are still children and this child deserves to be protected from the awful kind of person who spews hate speech, whether they share some genes or not. Hate like that is also painful, no matter how much teenagers pretend they don't care. The second Grandpa chose to attack he lost any right to sympathy on how his grandson chose to protect himself. Self-defense can be painful, but that's what Grandpa gets for putting him in that position in the first place. You don't get to whine when the person you punch breaks your nose, and you don't get to whine when the person you're actively verbally abusing gives you a verbal smack down. \n\nTo be clear, I don't blame you for your view on this. It's very common and I honestly believe most people see this as minimizing damage, but I don't think we're thinking far enough ahead and assessing the damage that our \"understanding\" of bigotry and violence has on the generations that SHOULD matter more to us.

Any suggestions?", "https://youtu.be/yiJ9fy1qSFI\n\nsorry mate, I knew I seent it somewhere", "Holy crap, no pun intended haha, that made my night!\n\nI don't know what video I was expecting but it sure as heck wasn't the Mythbusters throwing the shiny poop saying out the window and making it happen", "Yea you were the AH. And when he's gone you will probably regret your words to him, even though he's shitty to you. I have issues with authority and control. Drives me mad. So I reacted the same way to my elders treating me like that. I get sad often knowing I can no longer apologize He's not acting that way because he wants bad things for you. I think he wants what's best for you, but he's going about it all wrong. At his age, there's no doubt he has an old fashioned way of handling things. If you ever have grandkids, I'm sure by then, you will be set in old fashioned ways as well. (Hopefully with a bit more respect though). But yea you're 16. Whether what you said was right or wrong,you should bite your tongue. Hopefully when you're old and grumpy, you will be given the same respect", "YTA: Your grandad is a homophobic, grumpy old man but you are a brat. He was out of line but you were cruel. A little bit of empathy goes a long way.", "NTA\n\nEnjoy the silence while it lasts.  Yes, you did hurt your grandpa's feelings, but he called you a \"boy prostitute\" and said your beloved dead father was a drug addict.  That would deeply hurt MY feelings, and he does not get a pass on hurting the feelings of other members of the household because he's old.  He should be more mature, grow up, realize the world does not revolve around him or his twisted values (twisted because of the content of the rant that he offered), and as you pointed out, realize too that it is *not his house*.", "NTA you def hurt his feelings and it was completely valid and overdue", "NTA. I think your grandpa is a homophobe", "NTA for a lot of reasons.\n\nHe needed to be pushed back from this attitude of \u201cmy roof\u201d.  You reminded him of his place in the household and how he is no longer, \u201chead of the house\u201d.  \n\nWell done.", "NTA", "Nta but I think you want to consider your tolerance for his nonsense which is all he knows, he is acting like he was taught to act and believes what was accepted as correct in his time, is far lower then the tolerance your mother has having been raised by him. \nShe clearly recognized what was lacking in the way she was raised and therefore is raising you differently. I say this so you don\u2019t get frustrated but instead understand your mom\u2019s view. \nI think a large part of his unwillingness to change his opinions is because everything has changed for him once it was his roof and he earned and took care of his family he is not able to do that now or even fully take care of himself. That is a lot to face when he probably expected to be in a much better place. Having his daughter need to help support him and also living in her house is probably very difficult given the beliefs he was raised with. \nI\u2019m not saying that to excuse him I\u2019m saying that so you can treat him with empathy. There is not a better skill to have them to be able to find shine empathy for others. It will make you a better person and make it easier to deal with the most difficult of people it even sometimes allows those difficult people to grow. \nYou already know that you spending the night, having sex with your bf is a trigger for him. Is it necessary that you have to make it clear to him that is what you are doing. Couldn\u2019t you just discuss your plans with your mom privately and in front of grandpa say you are spending the night at your friends. I think that would be worth trying. It would ease things for your mom as well. And it gives him a graceful way to keep his head in the sand. \nYour mom may at some point have to be clear to him that she is raising you and if she has given you permission that is that. She could tell him he has already raised his child her and now he gets to be a grandpa and leave the raising of you to her. \nI understand your frustration but you will never improve any situation by reacting in anger or frustration if you can learn to act calmly and refuse to argue just hold your boundaries the situation may not resolve but it will not escalate and sometimes that is a win. Your life will be much better if you can learn to act by decision and not react out of emotions.", "Cant take the heat stay out of the kitchen. NTA", "NTA\n\nYour grandpa is clearly homophobic, made piss poor decisions with money (which is crazy seeing as boomers LITERALLY had the better economy and everything than we ever will), and has some sort of penchant to hate your father (my condolences for you and your mother).\n\nHe should be lucky he isn't put into a shitty old folks home to slowly wither away and you reminding him of that every so often might be totally OK in my book", "NTA. What you said was really under the belt. Did it have to be said, yes, (you mentioned you and your mother attempted to speak to him about boundaries and he ignored it) But it was still mean.

She came to him after a week asking if he's ready to apologize and he handed her divorce papers.", "Oh I feel this, haven't been to visit my dad and his significant other in a long time (3/4 years).

But staying there (home) again and reliving the shit she put me through, hell nah.", "Agree\n\nIf a person is just a big enough asshole then the different types of assholyness are harder to identify. Because everything they say is crap anyway, why listen to the specifics. You already know it's awful, do you really need to pinpoint the reason why?", "Spot on! It doesn\u2019t excuse grandpa but it is always helpful to understand why someone acts as they do and try to find a bit of empathy for them. \nApproaching difficult people with empathy makes it much easier for all. Trying to deal with grandpa out of anger is only going to worsen the situation for everyone.", "BTA", "ESH - The biggest AH here by far is your mom. It's her house, so she needs to set the rules for both you and gramps.\n\nYour grandpa sounds like he is (understandably) upset about having a sexually active teen granddaughter with apparently no boundaries? That doesn't excuse his tone or language, but I think the core of his concern is valid. Pregnancy, disease, emotional damage... you're playing with fire, kid. And neither your grandpa's abusive language nor your mom's lackadaisical parenting are doing you any favors.\n\nLikewise, I understand you don't want to be berated and attacked all the time, and are trying to defend yourself, but you shouldn't talk to him like that either. And to be fair, you shouldn't have to - that's your mom's job and she's failing at it.", "Nta", "NTA. \n\nI truly think your mom actually appreciates you standing up for yourself and her at the same time.

But I also know that people (and especially teenagers, no offense) are usually not objective in these situations.

I would trust her judgment on this.", "NTA what an absolutely brilliant response!", "[removed]", "Can't the mom kick out the grandpa? I understand that is morally very hard to kick family, but a toxic person is a toxic person, doesn't matter if its family or no.\n\nShe's doing him a favor.
