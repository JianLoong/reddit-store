But talk to your mom, tell her that granpas homophobia (because yeah, that's what that is) is really getting to you. As well as his controlling behaviour. That's its upsetting and stressing you out. Tell her that you know you shouldn't have yelled but his behaviour is really getting to you. His homophobic comments, his comments about your dad (how he talks about your mom??) - they hurt your feelings, and that isn't OK. You're the kid he's a grown adult.\n\nYour mom is in a tough position balancing familial obligations and finances plus her own grief and being a single mom.

This is the kind of response I would think of 2 hours after the argument!!\n\nHe tried to shut shame you and spoke badly about your deceased father. Then, he tried to make you feel less by saying you were being emasculated. \n\nIf I were you, I would go to your mom and say you're sorry if bringing her up in the argument upset her in any way. That was not your intent. Having said that, you will not be apologising to your grandfather because he is toxic to you in what he says and how he behaves. You should also say that his controlling behaviour is making this home less of a safe space for you, and you should not have to apologise to the person responsible for making this happen.\n\nThe sad thing about all of this is that his presence will probably make you move out sooner than you probably would if he wasn't there.\n\nGood luck OP", "NTA, Sounds like the truth of the matter", "NTA you aren't wrong.

It's about you being with someone of the same sex, not whatever else he's spouting off about. \n\nIn the future, try to speak calmly and have an intelligent conversation. Grandpa won't do that, but you can be the bigger person and it's really satisfying when you come out on top like that. You don't owe him an explanation. You don't owe it to him to convince him you're right. Grandpa may just have to d1e mad about it. And that's fine.", "NTA. i love this for you, good job sticking up for yourself.

But as someone else suggested, bringing your mom into the conversation (i.e claiming she has demasculated him) isn't fair to her. Ultimately, everyone needs to come to a consensus in the house on boundaries and resolve to treat everyone more respectfully. Your mom needs to be more firm on your grandpa, and your grandpa needs to realize it's not HIS responsibility to raise you or discipline you, but your MOTHERS. Your mother needs to NOT let your grandfather overstep his place and disrespect you.\n\nWhile I don't feel you were in the wrong in anything you said, understand that it can be very difficult for your grandpa. As a man of his generation, he's going to have very different opinions on how men should behave and very likely he feels hurt by his inability to care for himself.
