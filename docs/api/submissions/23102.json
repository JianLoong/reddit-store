Until Grandpa takes himself right outta the room whenever he feels a comment on OP\u2019s life coming on. I\u2019d go with \u2018I thought we discussed this? If there\u2019s a \u2018man of the house\u2019 here, it ain\u2019t you. So park it.\u2019 You need to get all those silent sulks lined up, back to back, until it\u2019s just\u2026 silence.", "SHE didn't demasculate him (gramps).  He did that by having to live with his daughter.", "That's been normal for the last century my dude.\n\nI mean it was normal before that, too, but.", "Yea, I got a summer job.", "\u201cHe is trying to be part of your life.\u201d\n\nNo. He is trying to control OP\u2019s life. What kind of grandpa calls his grandson a \u2018boy prostitute?\n\nGrandpa is an insecure and bitter man who is trying to exert whatever scraps of control he might find to feel better about himself.\n\nThat\u2019s it.", "God the faction of AITA that fetishizes old people remains so bizarre to me. Grandfather's an abusive jackass to an extreme degree. There's no relationship to damage, GP set it on fire long before this.\n\nHe's not \"trying to do what he can\", he's being a leech on a single income household.", "Right but this wasn't, like, revenge or some shit. This is trying to get an extremely abusive asshole to back off. It's not \"two wrongs make a right.\" It's someone who has, clearly, tried very hard not to escalate things finally hitting their limit.", "Except OP and his Mom have clearly done that repeatedly and it hasn't worked.", "Also grandpa shit talked *his dead dad* while his moms *has cancer*.\n\nLike the bar can\u2019t get any lower here.", "Enjoy the silence. Your mom has been verbally and emotionally abused by this man her whole life and doesn't see it for what it is.", "That may also be making grandpa extra stupid. It's great for you though in that there is an important reason to not be around your grandpa. When you are, use the Grey rock method. I'm sorry for the loss of your dad.", "More than that, OP **has** handled it with grace. It's not like he yelled back the first time his Grandfather was a dick. This has been an ongoing situation. \n\nOP's got way more grace than I think most people could ever manage. Running out eventually is to be expected, though.", "Mom has already quite a lot on her plate as a breadwinner for three people, and OP is apparently able to fend for himself.\n\nThe thing is, the grandpa is powerless at the moment. He is not even able to sustain himself, which must make a deep dent in his self-esteem because I suspect he is an old-fashioned sexist fart who believes that a man is the head of the household who provides for it and decides, and he must clearly see he is none of that and feel very inferior for it. (What he is doing is still totally unacceptable but it can be helpful to see what is behind it) . OP hit the very target with his words.", "> That may also be making grandpa extra stupid.\n\nCan you elaborate on how OP working makes the grandfather act dumber?"]}
