Some time later, my younger brother (M20) was born to them.\n\nSo, John was definitely a real piece of shit. I was a fat kid, and sometimes he wouldn't let me eat because he was angry about it. One of my first childhood memories is how he hits my head against the wall because I ate a chocolate bar.  Sometimes John \"punished\" me just because he was in a bad mood. He ruined my childhood, and I have to deal with some of the consequences of those events to this day.\n\nJohn treated my brother normally, he was a good father to him. My mom never did anything bad to me, but she didn't defend me either, she just said that he \"wouldn't do this to me if I was a good kid.\" When I was sixteen, mom and John divorced, but continued to communicate. Sometimes he would come to our house to help with repairs or spend time with my brother, but we ignored each other, didn't even say hello, and we haven't spoken since their divorce. Mom never started another relationship.\n\nSo, now let's move to the present. I married my friend, who comes from a wealthy family.
