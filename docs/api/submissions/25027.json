When I was two or three years old, mom married a guy (M43, we'll call him John), whom I considered my father for a long time. Some time later, my younger brother (M20) was born to them.\n\nSo, John was definitely a real piece of shit. I was a fat kid, and sometimes he wouldn't let me eat because he was angry about it. One of my first childhood memories is how he hits my head against the wall because I ate a chocolate bar.  Sometimes John \"punished\" me just because he was in a bad mood. He ruined my childhood, and I have to deal with some of the consequences of those events to this day.\n\nJohn treated my brother normally, he was a good father to him. My mom never did anything bad to me, but she didn't defend me either, she just said that he \"wouldn't do this to me if I was a good kid.\" When I was sixteen, mom and John divorced, but continued to communicate. Sometimes he would come to our house to help with repairs or spend time with my brother, but we ignored each other, didn't even say hello, and we haven't spoken since their divorce. Mom never started another relationship.\n\nSo, now let's move to the present. I married my friend, who comes from a wealthy family. I don't talk to my mother very often (now she works in a hair salon), sometimes I chatting with my brother (now he is a college student) and never communicate with John (he lives in his parents' house, but I do not know what he does for a living).\n\nSome time ago, mom and I were talking on the phone, and she mentioned that John fell from the roof of the house when he was repairing it. Allegedly, he has some serious injuries, but he does not have the money to pay for their treatment (in my country, any good medicine is paid and costs a lot of money, it's sad, but it's true.

I didn't understand why I needed this information, but for the sake of politeness I said something like \"I hope he'll be all right.\" Mom reacted a little strangely, but quickly changed the subject and I forgot about it.\n\nOver the next week, she called me every day, although this is VERY unlike her. Every time she told me about the \"plight\" of John. When, in response to another complaint, I suggested that my brother start earning, she replied that \"he still won't be able to earn as much money as you have.\" Then I realized what they wanted from me. I said that he will not receive the slightest amount from me, because my husband's bank account is not a charitable foundation, and John is a nothing to me.\n\nMy mom wrote me a long message where she said that I was a \"vindictive egoist who lives on grievances\". My brother and aunt also told me that my stepfather raised me and I am ungrateful.

You have NO obligation to this man in any way.\n\nYour Mother was complicit in the abuse. She should have stopped John from abusing you, but she didnt. Telling you that john wouldnt have abused you if you had been 'a good kid' was putting the blame for the abuse on you, the victim, rather than on John the perpetrator.\n\nShe is continuing this behavior by wanting you to pay for Johns treatment, and blaming you still. \n\nWalk away from them all and dont look back.

Sometimes blood may be thicker but family is someone who supports you through hardship and success, let that sink in for a moment your \n\u201cfamily \u201c let that man abuse you all because he raised you .

Funny how no contact was made until they needed something. \n\nNow your mother will have known what your step father did to you but your Aunt may not be aware at all. I sadly had a similar upbringing but it was my bio father, now that I'm an adult and speak about such things quite openly many family members are shocked and apologise for not acting or noticing. These sorts of abusers know how to get away with abusing, especially if they have someone there to cover for them.\n\nYour younger brother may always side with his father I'm afraid. Again speaking from experience. He may even idolise him thus he can't see the truth of the matter.\n\nPerhaps you could explain to both (if you already haven't) why you can't help in this instance.\n\nSorry you had to go through all of that as a child and sorry they are trying to guilt trip you now.
