Roommate will have their own room, of course, but also their own bathroom. But their bathroom is a 3/4 bath- toilet, sink, shower, but no tub- and I\u2019m offering a $50/month discounted rent covered by me (so I\u2019ll pay $1,050 and they will pay $950) for the inconvenience of the bathroom. And I will let them use my tub if they want to take a bath. \n\nThe balls on this chick to think she was going to come out even a little positive on this\u2026.", "Especially when her bedroom is in the common area :/", "Code for \u201cI\u2019m racist\u201d \n\nWhen I say they aren\u2019t the type of people I associate with I usually follow up with why like angry drunk or into meth or they abuse animals.", "Well then she had no right to be so judgmental and picky. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers.", "You are being a gigantic asshole. An enormous one... a **gargantuan** one. Good gravy YTA. Stop being a shitty person", "Ohhhhhhh the drama!", "If not fake, 100% racist", "I see that now and you're correct. I allowed a gut feeling about OP to take over.", "It said:\n\n>Hi Lauren you know all my trashy friends use Reddit so idk how you thought no one would see this. You have never tried to get to know my friends even through we invite you every time we hangout. You sit in your room with the door locked. For anyone wondering trashy = not white. Plz come talk to me directly and not on the internet.", "Right?! Like she\u2019s paying rent to live there, you\u2019re giving her half of the living room with a \u201cscreen\u201d for privacy AND THEN you\u2019re gonna say well you don\u2019t have your own room but don\u2019t use the stuff on the other side of your not own room\u201d?!?! Wtaf. \n\nOP in case you missed it, YTA.", "Perfect response", "Exactly I stopped reading after \u201cI told her they couldn\u2019t use my couch, tv\u2026 Smfh ridiculous", "If that\u2019s the case they should swap the bedroom after 6 months. Maybe OP would think twice then about throwing her weight around.", "Weed and cigarette smoke both like to cling to fabrics. But that\u2019s what febreeze is for.", "Oh wow!  I'm sorry that you had to deal with OP being as your roommate from Hell.  My suggestion is get out and find a better place with better roommates than her.  Not worth your time with her though.  \n\nTo OP, YTA\n\nYou should live by yourself if you have expensive stuff around here, you don't need a roommate.  You're so selfish and self centered.  And snob to boot.", "You deserve more than a corner of a living room if you\u2019re paying 50%. I hope alllll these people defending you and your friends shows you how wrong OP (your roommate) is acting. You have every right to use the common living areas and she can pout in her room about it. I would definitely start looking for another place to live. But I\u2019d also out my roommate for being a racist to everyone they know.", "Yeah I was wondering how she decided they were \u201cgross\u201d. Could she smell them? Did they have filthy hair? Like what did she mean? Oh, but she\u2019s racist and just means skin color. \ud83d\ude44", "I fucking *knew* it!", "Thanks!", "You are so right!! When I shared a 1 bedroom apartment with a roommate we did it dorm style and each got half the room. Sock on the nob for privacy. We weren't even that close. Just broke co-workers. We also tried to work opposite shifts.\n\nI don't understand why the OP couldn't have just gotten a freaking couch cover. Although, now we know it was a racism.", "Roomie comes across as a class act even in op's post. She'e still trying to be decent and is inviting her to hang out months after she's moved in, despite disdain just dripping from op's every word.", "I assumed they didn\u2019t bathe. That\u2019s the only people I wouldn\u2019t want on my furniture.", "I spent the whole time trying to figure out if OP was racist, misogynistic or just hated weed smells", "I leave my shoes on in other people's homes because I don't know what kind of condition the floors might be in, I got a bad splinter get infected last time I went barefoot at another person's house. If I'm going to someone's house and they don't allow shoes inside, I'll bring disposable boot covers and put them on at the door.", "I figured they were musty.", "i was guessing they were metal heads or something.", ">asking me to stay off cushioned furnishings or cleaning up with santitizer wipes after I move off wooden chairs.\n\nThat is *really* fucked up, holy shit. What the actual fuck is wrong with people? I'm straight as a pin and this shit offends me."]}
