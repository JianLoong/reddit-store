This is why you don't do surprise weddings.", "A short-notice wedding is the same as a long-distance wedding - inconvenient for people and you can't expect everybody to be free at short notice, the same way you can't expect everybody to be free/want/afford to travel.

People getting married need to understand everybody else's lives don't stop just because they are getting married.

Since you mentioned spring break but also an expensive trip I assume you are a teacher or maybe a working student? So your sister couldn't have been surprised that you would have plans for that time.  You could offer to attend if she rescheduled.", "NTA.  You offered a compromise and she rejected it.  Maybe she should grow up and realize weddings are usually announced months in advance for a good reason.", "It's not about whether it is \"more important\", it's about it being a *prior commitment*.

Unfortunately, she decided to break #1... springing it on everyone at short notice, making it difficult to make plans accordingly.
