This is why you don't do surprise weddings.", "A short-notice wedding is the same as a long-distance wedding - inconvenient for people and you can't expect everybody to be free at short notice, the same way you can't expect everybody to be free/want/afford to travel. If you being there was important to her she should have liaised with you about the date. People getting married need to understand everybody else's lives don't stop just because they are getting married. NTA", "NTA, she's making lots of demands for something that's supposed to be not a big production.", "NTA. Your parents were nice enough to offer a solution to this conflict your sister created.  Since you mentioned spring break but also an expensive trip I assume you are a teacher or maybe a working student? So your sister couldn't have been surprised that you would have plans for that time.  You could offer to attend if she rescheduled.", "NTA.  You offered a compromise and she rejected it.  Maybe she should grow up and realize weddings are usually announced months in advance for a good reason.", "It's not about whether it is \"more important\", it's about it being a *prior commitment*. If she can't see that, the hell with her. Expecting everyone to drop everything at such short notice is absurd. \n\nWhat's the big hurry anyway? She up the duff?\n\nOh and NTA obviously.", "So it's so important that you be there until it costs her money, and suddenly you caring about money is petty. \n\nDefinitely NTA.

I had a baby just a couple of weeks after my cousin. We discussed christening dates since we had cross over guest lists. Like normal caring people.", "NTA - if she wants everyone to attend, she needs to let everyone know with more time in advance.", "NTA! Why would you change your plans in the first place? You\u2019ve had this vacation planned for months. If you scheduled a vacation after you knew the date of her wedding, then I would say you are being an ass. I\u2019m sure as soon as you learn the date you let them know that you were going to be out of town. They didn\u2019t check with you in advance to see if you would be available. Why do people make this assumption that we are at their beck and call? NTA for real. Go on your vacation.", "DELETED: Forgot Spring Break is an American academic break with fixed time.", "NTA.

I guess she got the surprise.", "Look, technically NTA. \n\nBut this is the hill you want to die on? College spring break?

If she have you guys a choice of dates to make sure everyone important could attend, that would have been ideal. But they were thoughtless and now need to pay the price.", "NTA, and  pretty sure spring break is one of those events that everyone should know about. Yes, it's different weeks in different areas, but it's still happening. It's curious that your sister didn't consider something like spring break for not just your attendance but others as well.", "Ha!  Probably an \"I hate drama\" person too, who yet somehow is  always surrounded by drama.", "Fixed is generous here - could be any week in March.", "It does not sound like your typical college spring break. They have theater tickets, not wet Tshirt tickets. Depending on the show it could also be a once in a lifetime event.\n\nNTA.
