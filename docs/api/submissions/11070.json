Of course you wouldn\u2019t want to reschedule your paid-for vacation, and of course she\u2019d rather you be at her wedding, and of course your parents would try to keep the peace in any way they can. \n\nIf she did know, then NTA because she should have talked with you first and had the graciousness to acknowledge the position she was putting you in and offer to help pay your rebooking fees.", " sbsbddndn", "ESH...Your sister is clearly the bigger jerk here, but I do think you could have handled declining attending your sister's wedding with more class. For example, you could have said \"I'm on a tight budget and already spent what I can,\" or \"I've been looking forward to seeing this theater show all year, and I know your day will still be special without me there\" and reassured her that you were happy for her, etc. ...", "+1.  Having people you'd like to be there not be able to come is one of the downsides of a short-notice wedding.

She's your sister!!", "NTA. Plain and simple.", "Nta , tell her you'll make it to her next wedding.", "NTA", "Ugh. Nta", "NTA If a couple reeeaaaalllly want you to be at their wedding, it's probably a good idea for them to check with you to see if you are free then. Otherwise, they have to accept that you may have something else already scheduled.\n\nIf that didn't happen and they still reeeeaaaalllly want you to be at the wedding - so much that they want you to sacrifice event's you had scheduled, then the least they can do is cover the cost of you re-arranging your schedule.\n\nWAIT, NO. I stand corrected. The least they can do is not be mad if some of the money parents were going to give them would go to covering the cost of you re-arranging your schedule so that they could reeeaaaalllly have you at their wedding that they didn't bother to at least check with you before scheduling.", "NTA. \n\nAnd 'No.' is a complete sentence, don't forget that!", "NTA \n\nIt's fine that they don't want a big wedding. It's absolutely NOT ok to not give proper notice of an event, even a small scaled down event. It doesn't matter if it's 40 guests or 200, you send out save the dates WELL in advance and give people a heads up.\n\nIf you have a shotgun wedding, (anything within 6 months counts to me as shotgun) you are not allowed to get upset if some people can't make it.", "NTA, the world doesn't revolve around your sister", "NTA when you have a surprising/last minute wedding, you run the risk of people not being able to attend. That's why people send out invites 6 months or more out.", "Absolutely NTA.  This is why you send save the date notifications a year in advance.  People have lives that are just as important as anyone else\u2019s", "NTA. My cousin had a destination wedding specifically because it made it easier to \"unofficially uninvite\" a lot of toxic family/friends since a lot of our friends/relatives can't afford to leave the country for a 5-7 day trip. \n\nBut then she got super pissed when non-toxic friends also couldn't afford it and wouldn't 'support her big day'. \nShe even got pissed at her best friend who couldn't travel because of the Zika virus because she's been doing fertility treatments for YEARS and didn't want to risk birth defects in the early stages of pregnancy. \n\nObviously not the exact same situation, but...\nyou can't plan a convoluted and last minute wedding and expect other people's lives to completely revolve around your poor planning. \n\nLike, 6 months is kind of the bare minimum for notice; 9 months is very reasonable, and a year out is when you can get but hurt about people not putting in effort. \n\nMy brother is getting married in August and I am CONSTANTLY harping on him because he wants all his friends there AND YOU NEED TO ACCOMMODATE YOUR LOVED ONES SO THEY CAN PLAN AND BE PRESENT", "She is your sister.

One of the reasons to plan a wedding farther out is so people can plan to come. If you being there was important, she should either have given you more notice, or checked if the date worked for you.\nFWIW, my sister and I each asked each other if the date worked for the other before planning our weddings. And that was with 1.5 year long engagements.\n\nNow, personally, I\u2019d move hell and high water to be at my sister\u2019s wedding, but, some people not being able to come is the cost of a last minute wedding where you don\u2019t check the dates with the important people", "NTA\n\nOc her wedding is more important than your vacation.... to HER. :)", "NTA.

It would have been one, but my little brother in law wasn't going to make it, so we pushed it back a weekend. Some folks couldn't make it and that was fine, but our core families and best friends were there, the essential people we would have moved it for.
