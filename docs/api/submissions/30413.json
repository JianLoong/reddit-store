I was invited to a birthday dinner 2 weekends ago by a college friend. I did not know any of the other ladies that were invited. Since high school, I have not eaten meat for health reasons. All of my friends, including the birthday girl, know this. This friend is known to choose upscale restaurants with 4+ courses. I asked her for the name of the restaurant, so I could review the menu. She replied no and that it was a surprise. Lo and behold, it was an upscale restaurant with 7 courses. Unfortunately, at this restaurant, I was unable to choose different courses because it\u2019s considered a catered party. I was also unable to pick and choose what I could eat, like course 1-3, 5, 7, etc. I politely told the server I wouldn\u2019t be dining because of dietary restrictions and it was no problem. I stayed there and enjoyed my time with all of the ladies.\n\nAfter, we were supposed to go for a night on the town. I told the birthday girl I would go get something to eat since I didn\u2019t eat and would call her to catch up with the group. She said that was fine. After finding food and eating, I called and texted the friend 4 and 5 times, respectively, over the course of 30 minutes but was left with no answer. I assumed they were having a good time and just called an Uber back to my hotel. The next morning I woke up with a nasty message. It read: \u201cwhy tf would you fly all the way down here to not celebrate MY day. you could\u2019ve just sat there and ate the food. also who leaves the birthday group to do their own thing. that\u2019s why I didn\u2019t answer your messages.\u201d Quite honestly, I don\u2019t think what I did was wrong. I didn\u2019t make a scene about not being able to eat, and as far as I could tell, nobody else was affected by my decision. It seemed like everyone had a good time, the ladies enjoyed their food and I enjoyed my drinks. If this were anyone else, I\u2019d pay no attention to this message and continue with my life; however, this friend is in my wedding party next year. Because of this, I decided to reach out to her, but I\u2019ve been blocked.

You politely and with no dramatics stuck there through 7 courses!! And received no flex from the restaurant... Like not even one substituted course.\n\nThen you low key, no dramatics let em go ahead and not disrupt their plans whilst you of course ate because who wants to drunk and try and have fun hungry and with an empty stomach?\n\nThen they excluded you again by deciding collectively that no one would inform you of their location, leaving you alone by yourself at night to get home.\n\nAre you sure they are your friends? You might be theirs... But this smells of \"setting you up to be the bad guy\" my family pull this shit on me constantly.\n\nLike my birthday dinner after coming home from living overseas for 2 years was my brothers pick, I couldn't eat any of it cuz of intolerances and I was the bad guy cuz I didn't eat.", "NTA.

She knew you couldn't eat the meal she planned and didn't care. That's why she wouldn't tell you the restaurant. Maybe she is sick of knowing a vegetarian or just didn't want to accommodate you, but saying you should have just sat thames and eaten it shows she just doesn't care about you anymore.
