This year her sister (18) joined the house, even though we believed it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea. But the higher ups decided it would be cute if the sisters were in the same house together.\n\nSo she\u2019s been here for half a year and we are already irritated by her.\n\nShe comes into our room every day, and talks for hours about herself, she doesn\u2019t even care about what we have going on, it\u2019s always \u201cme me me\u201d to her. We can\u2019t get a word in. And if you turn away from her, showing that you are done and need to do homework, she will turn to the next person in the room who has working ears. \n\nEven when I pull the whole \u201cuh huh\u201d \u201cyeah\u201d \u201ccool\u201d \u201cnice\u201d \u201cdarn\u201d filler words to be nice, she will talk forever, (sometimes I\u2019ll even go completely silent) not getting the hint that we want to be alone or just work on college stuff like homework and quizzes, or even play video games with our headphones on.\n\nOne time she walked in while I was crying, crying hard, having a full on breakdown, and I was alone. She walked in and started to talk to me so I just looked up with tears in my eyes and said calmly \u201cplease leave\u201d. Then she went up stairs and cried, and my friend got mad at me for \u201cmaking her cry\u201d.\n\nI had to apologize\u2026 all I said were two simple words.\n\nTwo months later, me and my friend got into a new show together, and we try to watch it as much as we can, in our own room on our own tv. It\u2019s OUR show that we love. Then the sister keeps coming in to talk for hours, making us pause our show and stop in the middle. Then when we get back to watching it, she stays and talks through the whole thing when we just want to watch and laugh together. We were about to finish a season tonight, but the sister came in and kept talking. So I stormed off and now I\u2019m hiding where no one can find me (I\u2019m autistic, I have spaces where I can breathe).\n\nI just wish she would leave us alone. She has two other roommates, and we live in a house with 50+ people. You grew up together, she wants her own space away from you and now I do too. Make some friends.\n\nSo am I the AH for storming off, clearly upset just because she walked into the room? What should I do or do instead.\n\nSorry this is long\n\nEdit: my best friend is kind of a pushover, and let\u2019s her sister crawl all over her, rarely does she ever set a boundary.\nAnd the sister is super sensitive. If I tell her \u201chey, I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t talk right now, I need to take a quiz.\u201d She will take offense to it and act like I gave her the boot. Again, she\u2019s 18\u2026\nMaybe this is an autism thing, but when people say to me that they want me to leave, I just leave and do something else.", "created_utc": 1702370421, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ghg41/aita_for_wanting_my_besfriends_sister_to_leave_us/", "score": 21, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her sister should tell her, quite bluntly, because obviously she doesn't take hints at all.

I\u2019m a pretty \u201cspeak my mind\u201d kind of person. If I don\u2019t like you, I won\u2019t hang out with you, I\u2019ll avoid you. I also come from a house where our rooms were safe, I\u2019m the little sister in my house and bother me and my brother know to never come into each others rooms because it\u2019s disrespectful. That\u2019s their space, respect it.\n\nMe and my roommate get along so well. We\u2019ve never gotten into a fight, she\u2019s more abrasive when you get to know her, and she\u2019s soft spoken. A lot of people call her adorable and cute and tiny all of the time and it pisses her off. The only person that can walk all over her is her sister. Her sister has a crybaby hair trigger. In the real world, most people don\u2019t stand up to people like that, because they know they won\u2019t change, so they just learn to step around the hairs.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to convey when you don\u2019t know her, but my roommate isn\u2019t the problem, it\u2019s her sister. Her sister needs to learn that she can\u2019t always get what she wants.

How is that crying?", "I have, I haven\u2019t cried, I just got pissed because we wanted to watch our show and finish the season before we go on Christmas break, but her sister came in wanting to talk about herself. I get that I may be over reacting, but I need schedule, I need plans and schedules to stay as they are, and when they don\u2019t work out, I can get over it fast. But this has been happening every single day for the past month or so, and I\u2019m just irritated.", "Plus if I try to communicate that I don\u2019t want her to interrupt when we watch our show (because we tend to be pretty busy, so we have a set time everyday for when we can watch it), and she takes it personal and makes me look like the bad guy.", "You have a roommate problem, get a new one.

I'm sorry that you have to deal with this.", "Your roommate who has the sister should speak up.\n\nYou said \"we're annoyed\" but only spoke about your experience\n\nIf she bothers you so much, ignore her.", "Life lesson: If you ever want to convince someone of your perspective or have them do an action, you have to be calm about it. Being emotional will only lessen the effectiveness of your argument.\n\nBut, like I said, your roommate/friend doesnt think of her sister's actions as an imposition. You have already talked to her about it. The next step is to room with someone else. Trust me, I have boarded and roomed with friends in college and university too, being an incompatible roommate doesnt make you too any less of friends. Staying with her will only destroy your friendship. Take the hard step and move out of this situation.", "Change rooms girl.", "Look I get it\u2019s hard to see my perspective, but my roommate isn\u2019t the problem.

I am not shy and I\u2019m down to speak about things like adults, but her sister won\u2019t act like an adult and will play the victim.", "Respectfully no, we room great together, we have for the past 2 years.

You don't even know how to do YTA so don't comment", "have fun.", "I get that, we just don\u2019t want her to go crying upstairs, telling everyone how mean we are. I love pretty much everyone in the house, and anyone is welcome to come in as much as they want, she\u2019s the only one who gets on my nerves. If she goes crying and telling everyone that \u201ceveryone in the house hates me, I should just leave.\u201d It\u2019s going to cause so much drama, one of the downsides of living in a house full of women. \n\nI\u2019m mostly looking for a way to get her to leave us alone, without moving anyone, without causing drama, and without anyone looking like the bad guy for needing space from her.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 I give you one thing.. you have given me a giggle \ud83e\udd2d", "I\u2019m sorry, I know people can\u2019t understand this, but not everything should be solved by \u201cget rid of this person.\u201d Getting a new roommate is out of the question anyway, I have to wait until next year, it\u2019s how it is. We enjoy being roommates, we have fun, we laugh together. When someone is being mean to me, she stands up for me, and when someone is being mean to her, I stand up for her. HER SISTER IS THE PROBLEM.

Why are you getting so emotional over a random person's opinion? You asked for advice, I gave it. Dont agree with it? Fine. Move on. Why are you arguing further?", "I\u2019m not getting emotional, I\u2019m further explains my situation. Why are you calling this emotional.
