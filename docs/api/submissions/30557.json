Establishing boundaries, especially when it comes to your nuclear family's personal time, is entirely reasonable. Your concerns about your mother-in-law's increasing interference and your desire for family bonding on the camping trip are valid. Expressing the need for more independence doesn't mean excluding her but rather ensuring your nuclear family's quality time and bonding. It's essential to maintain a healthy balance between involvement and boundaries. It's unfortunate that it's caused tension, but standing up for the family's need for space and autonomy is not overstepping. It's a crucial step in maintaining a healthy family dynamic.", "NTA. However, you made one big mistake here. This was always going to be a tough decision for your MIL to accept, knowing that, the message should have come from your wife, her daughter, not you. \n\nWhile I believe both parents should have equal say in raising a child and the boundaries set on how involved outside family members should be in their children lives, any boundaries set should be communicated to those family members by their immediate family. It easier to take, harder to misinterpret(it clearly a family decision when it comes from wife, MIL can\u2019t make just you the bad guy), and less likely to avoid straining in-law relationships that are often minefields to begin with.", "NTA.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t easy to sort out the wrinkles of the asshole liabilities, but it\u2019s clear that you aren\u2019t one. Your wife is. The two of you came to a decision that you should have a conversation with her mother which had very obvious potential to go sideways, and then she decides she can blame you for it when it does. That\u2019s unfair. She can\u2019t wash her hands of the process and then get angry at you for the results. Assuming your wife genuinely agreed that her mother shouldn\u2019t go on this trip and that you should break the news, then she can either do her share of the dirty work or she can have your back when it gets dirty.\n\nI have mixed feelings about your MIL. While I do agree that strictly enforced limits on screen time are arbitrary and usually overbearing, I also believe that isn\u2019t her decision to make. She\u2019s an asshole for usurping your parental autonomy, even if I think she has a point (in that example). That said\u2026 it sounds like she is a lonely lady, transitioning into old age without much to keep her occupied. Jake has likely given her a reason to reengage with her family, with the world, and frankly with herself. You aren\u2019t wrong for wanting to establish some boundaries for her continued involvement in his upbringing, especially when she undermines your parenting, but isn\u2019t it rather predictable that she would be hurt? That she would become distant? That she would tell other family members why she is consistently sad and distant? Doesn\u2019t she have the right to those reactions- even if you\u2019re right?\n\nShe\u2019s an asshole for ignoring your rules unless you\u2019re there to enforce them; but she\u2019s not an asshole for being disconsolate in the aftermath. Your wife\u2019s an asshole for dodging the heavy lifting and then taking it out on you when it doesn\u2019t go smoothly. You aren\u2019t an asshole, but I do think you should undertake some extra effort to make sure your MIL knows you aren\u2019t excluding her from Jake\u2019s life. Make some time to do some special things which specifically include her so she can still feel an integral part of the family. Do it for the longterm health of your family, but also, have some compassion for what she\u2019s going through. Someday sooner than you\u2019ll ever expect, Jake will leave the house, and your life will fundamentally change yet again. It\u2019s not an easy adjustment, and someday you might find yourself struggling under the weight of the same burdens. Talk to her, and impress upon your wife that she needs to be there this time, and find a way to move forward. You\u2019ll thank yourself someday.", "NTA. Your MIL wants to be a third parent.

Barring any abuse or other traumatic experiences that your wife may have, there is no reason why you should be the one handling your wife's family of origin. Except that she didn't want to have an adult talk with her mother so she decided to let you hang and become the villain. That's super disrespectful.\n\nIf there is some kind of underlying trauma you haven't mentioned, this approach could possibly be justified. For example, I've been estranged from my mother for many years and my partner and I have had discussions about how we'd deal with her if we were in a situation where we were confronted with her. And we've agreed that we'll handle it together, but he'll do most of the talking - because of my own personal traumatic experiences with her which leads to my inability to stand up for myself. Your wife's situation does not sound like my own situation. If it is, that's a pretty significant part to leave out.\n\nYou need to have more discussions with your wife. There is nothing at all wrong with wanting to do a family camping trip (nucleus family, not family of origin) and there's even less reason for MIL to go nuclear over being excluded from a single camping trip. There's a lot going on here that you seem either oblivious to, or hesitant to face.

Establishing boundaries with family members, especially when it comes to parenting decisions, can be challenging.

Rule of thumb says you deal with your own family. In this case your MIL= your wife. That needs a very straightforward and blunt talk because this is a pivotal moment where future interaction either improves or deteriorates more. Good luck."]}
