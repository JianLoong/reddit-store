Establishing boundaries, especially when it comes to your nuclear family's personal time, is entirely reasonable. Your concerns about your mother-in-law's increasing interference and your desire for family bonding on the camping trip are valid. Expressing the need for more independence doesn't mean excluding her but rather ensuring your nuclear family's quality time and bonding. It's essential to maintain a healthy balance between involvement and boundaries. It's unfortunate that it's caused tension, but standing up for the family's need for space and autonomy is not overstepping. It's a crucial step in maintaining a healthy family dynamic.", "NTA. However, you made one big mistake here. This was always going to be a tough decision for your MIL to accept, knowing that, the message should have come from your wife, her daughter, not you. \n\nWhile I believe both parents should have equal say in raising a child and the boundaries set on how involved outside family members should be in their children lives, any boundaries set should be communicated to those family members by their immediate family. It easier to take, harder to misinterpret(it clearly a family decision when it comes from wife, MIL can\u2019t make just you the bad guy), and less likely to avoid straining in-law relationships that are often minefields to begin with.", "NTA.", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t easy to sort out the wrinkles of the asshole liabilities, but it\u2019s clear that you aren\u2019t one. Your wife is. The two of you came to a decision that you should have a conversation with her mother which had very obvious potential to go sideways, and then she decides she can blame you for it when it does. That\u2019s unfair. She can\u2019t wash her hands of the process and then get angry at you for the results. Assuming your wife genuinely agreed that her mother shouldn\u2019t go on this trip and that you should break the news, then she can either do her share of the dirty work or she can have your back when it gets dirty.\n\nI have mixed feelings about your MIL. While I do agree that strictly enforced limits on screen time are arbitrary and usually overbearing, I also believe that isn\u2019t her decision to make. She\u2019s an asshole for usurping your parental autonomy, even if I think she has a point (in that example). That said\u2026 it sounds like she is a lonely lady, transitioning into old age without much to keep her occupied. Jake has likely given her a reason to reengage with her family, with the world, and frankly with herself. You aren\u2019t wrong for wanting to establish some boundaries for her continued involvement in his upbringing, especially when she undermines your parenting, but isn\u2019t it rather predictable that she would be hurt? That she would become distant? That she would tell other family members why she is consistently sad and distant? Doesn\u2019t she have the right to those reactions- even if you\u2019re right?\n\nShe\u2019s an asshole for ignoring your rules unless you\u2019re there to enforce them; but she\u2019s not an asshole for being disconsolate in the aftermath. Your wife\u2019s an asshole for dodging the heavy lifting and then taking it out on you when it doesn\u2019t go smoothly. You aren\u2019t an asshole, but I do think you should undertake some extra effort to make sure your MIL knows you aren\u2019t excluding her from Jake\u2019s life. Make some time to do some special things which specifically include her so she can still feel an integral part of the family. Do it for the longterm health of your family, but also, have some compassion for what she\u2019s going through. Someday sooner than you\u2019ll ever expect, Jake will leave the house, and your life will fundamentally change yet again. It\u2019s not an easy adjustment, and someday you might find yourself struggling under the weight of the same burdens. Talk to her, and impress upon your wife that she needs to be there this time, and find a way to move forward. You\u2019ll thank yourself someday.", "NTA. Your MIL wants to be a third parent.

Except that she didn't want to have an adult talk with her mother so she decided to let you hang and become the villain. That's super disrespectful.\n\nIf there is some kind of underlying trauma you haven't mentioned, this approach could possibly be justified. For example, I've been estranged from my mother for many years and my partner and I have had discussions about how we'd deal with her if we were in a situation where we were confronted with her. And we've agreed that we'll handle it together, but he'll do most of the talking - because of my own personal traumatic experiences with her which leads to my inability to stand up for myself. Your wife's situation does not sound like my own situation. If it is, that's a pretty significant part to leave out.\n\nYou need to have more discussions with your wife. There is nothing at all wrong with wanting to do a family camping trip (nucleus family, not family of origin) and there's even less reason for MIL to go nuclear over being excluded from a single camping trip. There's a lot going on here that you seem either oblivious to, or hesitant to face.

My mom would tell her she makes no rules, gets no say, doesn\u2019t make any decisions or she\u2019ll never see her grandkids again. About EVERYTHING. I had some sensory issues as a child and my mom liked to make food I\u2019d hate and force me to sit there for hours until I ate it. Trying to break my will. I would sit there for 8+ hours at a time at four years old my grandma would cry and beg to make me something or let me up and she would say no. Now though as a grandparent she thinks she runs shit. Constantly undermining my sisters with their kids, inviting herself everywhere, competing with their in laws. It\u2019s wild.

Even if MIL were awesome it might not be a good trip for her- camping involves roughing it, camp beds, having to stumble to the loo during the night, etc. not the most fun for an older lady. Does she even like camping? Also it\u2019s rude to invite yourself on a trip. Ignore the \u2018woe is me\u2019 pearl clutching.

She\u2019s not a parent, she\u2019s Grandma and trying to dominate a growing teenage boy is going to backfire and damage her relationship with her grandson because she\u2019s trying to prevent stuff his parents are fine with.\n\n\nEdited to add: maybe do like a friend of mine did with his mum and give her what she wants\u2026.this time\n\n\nShe nagged to go on a family fishing and camping trip. \n\n1. They tried to book her her own tent close to the bathrooms but she insisted she wanted to share with her grandson (8 at the time). Ok then. \n\n2. They warned her that their son still had two bedtime habits which would be disruptive to her sleep- he banged his head and snored. Not at the same time but still disruptive. Grandma said she didn\u2019t care so they said ok then you can share with son.\n\n3. They advised her to drive her car to the campsite or convoy with them so she had her own vehicle if she chose to leave early or wanted to go anywhere. Nope, she wanted to travel with the family. Ok then. \n\n4. They advised her to travel light, bring warm clothes to layer on and extra layers for night time. She bought a suitcase.\n\n5. The area they were camping in is a dead zone for cell signal. She was warned that she likely wouldn\u2019t be able to get a signal for Wi-Fi unless she went to the lodge- the only building there which did have Wi-Fi for guests but step three feet out the door and everything does dark. \n\n\nThe journey in a cramped car with three adults, one child, their dog and camping supplies was both long and draining and uncomfortable. \n\n\nThe wife was recovering from a serious spine injury (mild hikes and fishing ok, no high impact or energetic activities) so had to sit in front and MIL isn\u2019t insured on their vehicle so couldn\u2019t drive. She was squashed in the back seat with her grandson and her bag on her lap because the dog was in his travel crate in the boot with the other luggage. \n\n\nOn trips the Son likes to listen to audiobooks or music on his iPod so didn\u2019t want to talk or play games with his grandma. He also gets car sick so they stop every so often to go to the bathroom and let him settle his stomach if he\u2019s feeling rough. Journey wasn\u2019t quick enough or comfortable enough for MIL so she was aggravated.\n\n\nThe tent was near to the lake which was further away from the toilet block than the single person tent MIL was offered so she complained about walking further. \n\n\nShe complained about being cold- it was October in the UK, that means it\u2019s cold, wet, windy, chilly, grey, miserable, etc. Bring layers means bring layers. She hadn\u2019t brought the right clothes or waterproof boots. \n\n\nThere was no electrical charger in the tent. Obviously. MIL hadn\u2019t thought of that and bitched for hours about how she could charge her phone. Kind staff member allowed her to charge it in the office but there was obvious side eye at this point because who expects electricity in a basic tent? \n\n\nMIL is a social media addict. She couldn\u2019t get a signal anywhere except in the lodge. Refused to leave because it was drizzling so spent hours over the trip sat alone staring at her phone. The lodge got a couple of bars but not fast Wi-Fi so she was pissing and moaning to everyone within earshot.\n\n\nBut the real kicker came at night. Son is on the spectrum and bangs his head repetitively at intervals while sleeping. He also snores. Not badly but he\u2019s basically making some noise all night. \n\n\nMIL couldn\u2019t sleep. She was cold in the tent, despite having two winter sleeping bags and a blanket borrowed from the lodge. Don\u2019t blame her because our weather sucks but she was really miserable. She was cold and couldn\u2019t sleep because of Son\u2019s noises. When she went to the bathroom in the night she got soaked walking to the loo and her slippers were wet through (she didn\u2019t think to put on her trainers). Finally she lost her shit with son, shook him awake and shouted at him to behave normally and sleep like a good boy. Son, woken from deep sleep by his screaming grandmother in an unfamiliar place, instantly started sobbing and calling for his parents. My friend and his wife woke up, wife started comforting her son and settling him for bed while my friend went very very quiet- friend is a loud man. When a loud person gets quiet, it\u2019s not a good sign. He told his mum to get dressed, they were going to the lodge to get a hot drink. Protests and tears were ignored and MIL got dressed and out they went. \n\n\nWife was busy settling her son but was informed by the lodge keeper at breakfast (staff remained at the lodge 24/7 for emergencies) that her husband basically read his mum the riot act once out of earshot of the tents. That she\u2019d been told clearly what the trip was to be like, that they knew she wouldn\u2019t enjoy herself and tried to tell her, she\u2019d hated everything and complained nonstop and the final straw was shaking his sleeping child awake and shouting at him for a habit she knew he had and had been warned about and offered her own tent for that reason. He told her that either she made an effort to join in or she could go home but she wasn\u2019t upsetting his family and ruining their fun. Then he went back to the tent. MIL sat trying to get sympathy from the night staff and then sulked while posting on Facebook until breakfast. \n\n\nAfter breakfast which was silent on MIL\u2019s part the family went out for a nice light hike and some fishing and lunch at the pub, etc. MIL stayed at the lodge. She couldn\u2019t go home because she had no car and since it\u2019s a rural area there was only one local taxi and he was booked until the evening. She allowed her son to book her a tent of her own and sat either in her tent alone or in the lodge for the next few days. Her grandson was now scared of her and refused to go near her, her DIL was over it and ready to go mama bear and her son wasn\u2019t bending to her will and taking her home/ cutting the trip short. \n\n\nTLDR: maybe give MiL what she wants? Might help it never happen again", "NTA. Meddling grannies are all very well, but if they can't find their place of their own accord, it is neccessary to show them that place. Of course you need to be able to raise your son the way you want. Granny should not be able to impose her \"rules\" in your home. As for your camping trip, you are perfectly entitled to time with just your nuclear family.", "NTA. But you and your wife are dumb. Why did you guys agree to YOU talking to HER mom? Now both the mom and wife are angry at you.", "NTA, but why would wife agree that a discussion needed to be had, and then get mad at you later? She needs to be the one to speak to her mother, not you. She basically just threw you under the bus by encouraging you to talk about boundaries and then when it didn't go well she gets upset. That's ridiculous. Tell wifey to put her big girl panties on and tell her mother to back off.", "NTA.  But why did your wife not deal with her mom?  You totally got thrown under the bus as the bad guy.", "NTA this is such a reasonable boundary I can\u2019t believe all these family members care so much about placating MIL. Is she blackmailing them into calling you or something? Good for you for having a spine MIL needs to build a bridge and get over it.", "NTA. \n\nYour MIL has lost respect for your privacy and for your and your wife\u2019s right to raise your child as you see fit. Boundaries clearly need to be set. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry to say it but your wife did throw you under the bus!  It ought have been her responsibility to talk to her mother; she needed to do so and present it as a \u201cunited front\u201d decision from the two of you. \n\nGood luck; I hope the relationship with your MIL can be rebuilt in a healthier form.", "NTA.  You're entitled to enjoy your family without the MIL being involved in everything.  And it is just WRONG for her to override your rules, discipline, etc.  Your wife needs to stop catering to her mom.  The family needs to stop giving into your MIL just to keep the peace.  Time to put your foot down.", "NTA- It is ridiculous that you are the one expected to talk to your wife\u2019s mother about her behavior. Your wife should be the one to clarify boundaries with her family. Good luck, though, since this is a kind of thing that will likely always be a problem.", "NTA\nBut your wife should be talking to her own mother about this.", "NTA.  If you give her an inch, your MIL will take a yard, and another yard, and another.  If you don't enforce boundaries, she will continually push them.  As for screen time, I worked for a developmental paediatrician for many years and, for 10-year-olds, she recommended 2 hours maximum daily (not including homework).  More than that can significantly affect sleep.  Known side effects of excessive screen time in childhood include eye strain, greater risk of chronic health conditions, poorer concentration, weaker memory, slower information processing, weaker impulse control, impaired socialisation skills, and delayed learning.", "NTA\n\nWow Your wife threw you under the bus. She got to be upset but she was the one should should have talked to her mother! Keep going with the boundaries. And maybe cut back on some MIL visits until she learns that she has to go with the flow for your parenting style. It's very confusing for kids to have to remember the rules with different people and houses. Fun MIL does not get to stomp all over your rules.", "NTA but your wife is for making you draw the boundaries with her mom.  She should be doing that, or both of you as a united front.  Instead she was able to make you be the bad guy. \n\nYour son is 10. Barring any special needs, the days of \"needing help\" are long behind you.  There's no reason for MIL to need to go camping \"to help\".\n\nMIL needs to find some hobbies, and get friends her age.", "Nta. Blame your wife.", "NTA. Boundaries are essential with anyone who starts to disrespect your parental authority or it will only get worse as your child gets older and can be manipulated more easily. And as many others have said your wife needs to be the one standing by you here and setting those boundaries with her mother rather than happily letting you look like the big meanie.", "So I take it the \"other family members\" expressing concern are now going to be including her in every outing? Thought not.", "NTA yeah your wife should have been the one to handle that, and she\u2019s a AH for leaving you out to dry.", "Your wife should have been the one to talk to her mother, not you. \nMIL was never going to take it well, but your wife being pissed at you is BS. She needs to get on your side.\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA.  Grandparents do not need to be included in your every activity and decision.  She needs a hobby and your son shouldn't be it.", "NTA don't be guilted into submission and tell the family members to mind their own business", "Nta. You spoke your truth about your time with your family. If that offends your mil then she has some work to do. You communicated honestly. She didn't want to hear it. That isn't really your problem.", "INFO:\n\n> I had an honest conversation with my wife about my concerns. We agreed that I should talk to my mother-in-law about boundaries\n\nIs that correct? You and your wife discussed this and decided that you should be the one to talk to your MIL instead of your wife talking to her own mother? Why?\n\n> Now my wife is upset with me\n\nWhat? Why?", "NTA, your wife made this problem she can fix it. It is her mother she should have spoken to her. Your wife is being selfish. She is teaching your child how to avoid and push personal responsibilities on others. She is setting a poor example for her child. \n\nYour wife needs to accept when she got married and had a child her immediate family shifted and greatest obligations are now her child and husband.", "NTA but your wife is die letting you take the blame", "Info: why didn't your wife talk to her own mother about boundaries?  That's her role. If it were your mother, you would talk to her. \n\nNta. Don't cave.", "NTA and your wife is a coward. Her mother is her responsibility when it comes to setting boundaries.", "Absolutely NTA.  I say this as a spouse that moved in her own mother with us and our kid for 10 years.  My hubby & I don\u2019t regret it at all but it\u2019s tough.  She also interfered with our parenting & me & hubs had to have some uncomfortable conversations.  We, of course, always knew she meant well but intentions don\u2019t matter if it\u2019s an issue.  Set some boundaries and DEFINITELY do some things for just the 3 of you.  Good luck!", "If I\u2019ve learned one thing from this place, it\u2019s ALWAYS rock the boat, tip that MFer aaalllll the way over.", "[removed]", "Yes, why did that have to fall on OP if it's his MIL?? Wife should've done that, not him.", "NTA\n\nGet your wife to therapy/couples counseling.\n\nShe needs to deal with her mother not you", "You need to set the rules and enforce them as your wife's not going to do it. She turned on you the min her mom was upset. \n\nYou need to put mom on a time out. Let hr wine and complain but she needs time away from your family. \n\nYour kid needs memories that don't include his grandmother. Otherwise they'll just think that grandma was suffocating and culdnt just let him have time with his family alone. \n\nDo you really want all of your kids memories to be full of her and tarnished and overshadowed by a grandmother who can't back off.", "Why do your comments on other posts say you're female, when you say you're male on this one? \ud83e\udd14\ud83e\udd14\n\n\"Girl, we just power through \u2013 heating pads, painkillers, extra bathroom trips, and lots of deep breaths help us push through the workday like the bosses we are! \" \n\nis what you commented on a post about how do women work certain jobs on their period?", "OP your wife is a major AH in this situation. You did the right thing - you sat down and spoke to her about your concerns so you two could agree. Then it's really *her* responsibility to set boundaries with *her* mom, though it also would have been fine for you both to do it as a united front.\n\nInstead, she made you set boundaries and then got mad when her mom threw a fit. She essentially threw you under the bus. This is not okay and does not bode well for your marriage unless your wife recognizes how wrong she was and makes it right. Y'all may need couples counseling.", "So, I\u2019m a military vet. I\u2019m over 40. And 5-6 years ago I had a HUGE blowup with my older golden-child brother. We fought about A, and he brought in X, Y, and Z. He said things about my kids and my nuclear family. At that point, I cut him off. He is now dead to me. I try to avoid him at all costs.\n\nSince then, I have realized that I lived my life in constant chaos. My childhood, the military, war, life post-military, my brother\u2019s drama (it never seemed to end), drama with the in-laws, all of it. It was constant chaos. I now want peace. Metaphorically speaking, I have a \u201cCircle of Peace\u201d. If you don\u2019t bring my life peace, you\u2019re not in my circle and you can get cut off. I truly don\u2019t give a fuck if the whole world is about to burn\u2026as long as my 4 (kids and wife) are good, I will light the bitch up my damn self. Friends and family in my circle?\u2026Sure, so long as they can provide peace. The moment there is chaos\u2026you\u2019re out. \n\nI no longer deal with my in-laws, and I only speak to a few family members since my grandparents passed away. But overall, I\u2019m happier. I\u2019m more at peace, and I no longer take phone calls that are going to disrupt that. \n\nYou can take those calls from extended family members if you want to\u2026but I would tell them to fuck off. Why deal with that shit? I\u2019m not saying I\u2019ve turned into a 70\u2019s hippy or anything\u2026far from that. I just don\u2019t deal with the bullshit anymore. \n\nEnforce your boundaries. I should have done it a looong time ago. These last 5-6 years have been a blessing, and they keep getting better with time."]}
