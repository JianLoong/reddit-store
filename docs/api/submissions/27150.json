Has he shown that he can stay sober over a prolonged period of time?", "NTA  Feel free to just lie to everyone, say you got tested & aren\u2019t eligible. Make your life easier & avoid being harassed by your family. Or stop talking to all of them until they agree the subject is off limits.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t just \u201ccan you do me a trivial favour\u201d talking about major surgery and possible impacts to your own health! Damn right not to donate to someone who made your life a misery and in all likelihood he won\u2019t be grateful won\u2019t change and will continue drinking.", "NTA nothing like empty promises and regret from an abusive family member when it comes to body parts or money", "NTA. There is no obligation to give up part of your body to someone who treated you so horribly, even if he's crying for 'forgiveness' now. Don't let your family guilt trip you. Your feelings are your own.", "NTA\n\nDonating organs isn't the simple procedure everyone wants you to think it is. Even successful transplants will have side effects for the donor, but liver donors have died in surgery.", "NTA. But you don't have to stand on principle to make this decision. You can get rid of a lot of the heat you are facing if you go get tested, and tell them that you don't want to donate and are being pressured to. That makes you not a good candidate and you can say officially that you can't donate.", "NTA. If you do get cornered into getting tested, tell the doctor you're being pressured.", "NTA - but ouch, this is a heavy burden for you and I hope you get counseling.\n\nThere\u2019s a significant risk to you for this type of donation, and it sounds like he still would drink with the new liver part. Is it worth jeopardizing your health, just to have him still drink and die anyways from the same condition.", "NTA.\n\nMy mother died from alcoholism and was never eligible for a transplant but the doctor told me that even if she was eligible,  she'd need to abstain from drink entirely for at least two years post transplant to give her body a chance to recover. There was no way she could have done that. \n\nEveryone always wants the child to forgive the parent. Nobody ever stands up for the child while they're suffering, they just seem to think if you turned out OK as an adult your parent couldn't have been that bad really. \n\nHold strong. Lie about not being a match if necessary.", "NTA. It is nice that he's asked you for forgiveness. It isn't nice that it appears to be because he wants your liver.  I hope I'm wrong.\n\nSide note: Forgiveness isn't for the person asking - forgiveness is for you so you can let go of the pain he caused so it won't continue to fester. Forgiveness helps you move on (doesn't mean you let him back into your life if you don't want to), in your own time though. \n\nMy father is an alcoholic too. It takes a long time to heal from that.", "Wow, TIL that you don't have to be dead to donate your liver.  I've heard that your liver will regenerate if injured, but I didn't know you could donate just a piece of it.  Either way NTA, he made his bed and now he can lay in it.", "Unpopular opinion but i really f* hate people like your father, who drink and abuse and when it karma comes as a large spiked dildo they beg and plead for the victims to donate organs or money.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYou don't owe him shit. Go NC and move on.", "Also, if your father is still a heavy alcoholic, there is no way he'd be on the donor list. You have to be sober for up to 6 months in order to make it on that list. They don't like to give organs to people who are just going to abuse the new ones like they did the old.", "NTA, just say you're not a match. If they push say you need your liver longer than his sobriety, you don't owe them anything.", "NTA.  Firstly, you don't even know if you're eligible.  Second, why does anyone else think they can tell you what to do with your body? If you were pregnant, would they all get to decide whether you keep it or not? No. That decision is yours and yours alone.", "NTA. Nope nope nope.", "Nah, you're not an asshole. It's understandable that given your experiences with him, it would be difficult to decide if helping him was the right thing for you or not. Everyone needs to decide for themselves what they can or cannot do in these kind of situations and no one should judge them for it.", "NTA, though if you want to shut up the situation, you can go in for a match screen and tell them it is under duress and you do not wish to donate. They will tell him you're not a match and remove the issue of them nagging.", "NTA. Good lord, you were a victim of abuse. You owe him nothing. However, you may want to look at forgiveness. Not for him but for yourself. Forgiveness is always about ourselves it's never for the other person and forgiveness does not mean you have to have them in your life at all. But if you can find it in you to forgive it will probably take a lot of stress off you but keep in mind it doesn't mean you have to have nothing to do with him and remember it's for you.", "NTA, no.\n\nYou aren't obligated to give anything to an abuser.  Honestly, you shouldn't have  bothered with the visit.  He's getting to see you on his terms.", "NTA. It's your lover, your life, your choice. Even if he was the best father ever and wasn't an alcoholic it would still be your choice. Don't let them guilt trip you. He was abusive and even if he apologised, it doesn't make up for what he did. If the rest of your family won't accept your decision, go NC.", "NTA\n\nHe's not sorry, just regretful that it all caught up to him. If he didn't need a transplant he'd still be the same.", "NTA. If it helps keep the peace the transplant coordinator will tell your family that you aren't eligible to donate. You don't need to actually get tested, not wanting to donate for any reason makes you ineligible by itself.", "NTA I agree with everyone else. Go get tested but tell the transplant people you are being pressured and don\u2019t want to donate.", "NTA\n\nMy alcoholic stepfather died from liver failure/complications from liver failure, I could not have donated but I would have refused if I could.", "NTA.\n\nI would donate a kidney any time to my niece, who has kidney disease.  I wouldn't donate ANYTHING to an alcoholic.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nalso idiot moment here, don't you need your liver?\n\nedit: thanks for the answers!", "NTA but you can always go to your doctor and get an incompatibility note. They don't even have to actually test you. Basically, if you go in tell them you're being pressured most Drs will help. It might help with keeping a good relationship with your siblings, if that matters to you.", "NTA\n\nThough I think it was a mistake to visit if you weren't open to talking with him and mending fences to any degree.", "Nta\n\nI don't think a hospital would allow this transfer surgery anyway, there he is an alcoholic?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Pushing people to do so before they're ready is just piling on guilt that nobody needs.", "Live donors make up a pretty small proportion of transplants, roughly 5%. The donor gives 40-70% of their liver and if all goes well it regenerates over a few months. OP would need to take 12+ weeks off work. This is no small commitment, you don't just say yes.", "NTA. you can't get on the donor list, but in most countries a direct donation forgoes any list. That is if a family or friend wants to donate a organ to a specific person then pretty much every other qualification isn't required beyond matching, it not being coerced and the donator being healthy enough for it and understanding the risks.\n\nThe thing is here there is a significant risk to op, complications from surgery, potential problems with a full recovery, cost of not working for a while and medical costs involved. Insurance is afaik, very unlikely to cover a direct donates for a alcoholic without significant evidence of rehabilitation. Like documented attendance at rehab, therapy sessions and periodic blood tests (but likely quite regular ones). \n\nNow these are all things that for a family member in good standing are still major issues and can still not be worthwhile if the risks are too high vs the outcome. If you're a higher risk donator and the receiver is only expected to get 6 months it's not worth it, etc. When the receiver was an abusive asshole, the risks will basically never be worth it. They are asking op to potentially risk his life for a man he has no contact with who he remembers beating his mother his whole childhood. Fuck that, no guilt. I'd sooner donate for a stranger than an abusive toxic drunk.", "I am a member of a certain 12 step program and this is a great response", "They don't remove all of the liver, only part of it. The liver is the one organ in the body that can regenerate itself, so a lot will grow back. But it's still major surgery that no one should be pressured into.", "You're not an idiot! Partial transplants from living donors are hardly everyday knowledge.", "No, the recipient's insurance is charged.", "That is not accurate", "OP is NTA and should absolutely not be pressured in this.  But, if you take out the abuse and alcoholism there are many children who would gladly donate to their parent to help save their life.

It's an organ that's really good at regenerating.", "That is not how it works.", "90% of my family are alcoholics, FORCED sobriety just means a long pause on drinking.

It already has a timer because it is not-self adding alcohol to that would probably speed up the timer faster.", "Check out what became of Micky Mantle. Pathetic. \n\n   There are the Sick, & there are the Healthy. Often the sick carry on over -if it wasn't One thing -it'd be Another. They run everyone through the wringer All their lives over Their Issues. Finally-it's best for our Own sake -to \"detach\" as it's called in AA , Whatever \"detachment\" involves -it's key if wanting to remain as healthy & strong throughout your Own life as much as possible. AA meetings  & the material available are great for even those who do Not drink.. It's also applicable to Anyone dealing with even just Addictive Behaviors, as a means of avoiding becoming a toxic partner or friend.", "You probably don't even have to lie. Tell the transplant team you're being pressured to donate and you don't want to and they will not let you donate.", "Cutting ties is never out of the question, it\u2019s just a question you\u2019d rather not think critically about.

In the event that they won\u2019t take your word for it, talk to the doc and he can say you\u2019re not a match. As bad as the healthcare system is, they\u2019re not cutting organs out of unwilling donors. Imagine the lawsuits!\n\nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong, OP. He\u2019s only reaching out when he\u2019s in desperate need of something you could potentially provide. It sucks that you don\u2019t have the support of your family; however, the only person to blame here is the man behind the bottle. It\u2019s too little too late- there is no edit undo button on life. He\u2019s not begging for forgiveness, just an organ", "That is incorrect. Medical personnel have ethical obligations, and cannot reveal information about OP without OP's express consent. Furthermore, no transplant team would ever allow someone to donate if they said they were being pressured, so all OP has to do to get the family off his back is go in to get tested and tell them his family is trying to pressure/coerce him into donating.", "I get your point - if OP doesn\u2019t go at all and just lies the transplant team would likely say \u201cno, we didn\u2019t have someone in this week to get tested\u201d \n\nOP could definitely go get tested though and let the team know they don\u2019t feel comfortable donating.  At that point the medical team will say they weren\u2019t a match.  Also - bonus that you get a really thorough medical work up at no cost to you (that relates to the US, probably irrelevant if OP lives elsewhere)\n\nMy dad actually just received a live liver transplant a few weeks ago as he had liver cancer (recovery is going great for both donor and recipient - woohoo!) and I went with my husband when he was tested to be a donor.  They were very clear that if you had any concerns they would say you weren\u2019t a match.  We met with a whole team, multiple doctors, transplant coordinator, social workers, etc.  and each one met with him separate from me to ask him those questions.", "Good for You! I love that program. I've never been to their Meetings, but a Counselor had used much of their Material over my case. I wasn't even complaining about anyone Drinking, but I think the program can be applied to a lot of situations . OP-you may want to check it out . I think a lot of the Material is available online too, so you don't have to go to the Meeting, yourself, but it helps to just become familiar with the program & see how it can work for you .", "Yeah no kidding.", "Exactly, OP has no idea what his father would do with the liver. This isn't like donating blood, it's an invasive procedure with a lot of downtime for the donor. The sister may say he is sober, but how does OP know that is the truth?

Of course it's the internet, people lie, but what does this person gain from having people think they're a medical professional, in order to... make OP think that her dad would definitely find out if she claimed to not be eligible?? Like why do they care so much that they'd pretend to work in healthcare and on top of that not even do basic research on how the law they\u2019re citing works including how to spell its acronym?\n\nI don't get it lol\n\nIf they think OP needs to get a part of her body cut out for her abuser because that\u2019s just how life should be in their book, they could just say that."]}
