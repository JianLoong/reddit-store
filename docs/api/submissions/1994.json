And the fact they are uncomfortable around her in her \"swimming costume\" just shows how unreasonable and insecure they are.

The brother's girlfriend sounds obnoxious. Why are you even catering to her?  They need to blend in with your routine, not dictate what you do in your own home.

I would never act like that in someone else's home. How rude!", "So your brother's gf who is \"visiting\" for a couple of months or more, staying (I am assuming for free) in a home that belongs to your gf's family doesn't want your gf to use swimwear to get into her own pool in her own house? \n\nHow ridiculous and entitled of those two! They should be kissing your gf's feet for letting them stay in her family's house. A nice house where they have their own bedroom and can even use the swimming pool.

Or is it only your gf's swimwear they don't like?\n\nAs far as the \"noise\" is concerned, if your toddler doesn't get in the pool at 6:30, do they think it means she's going to sleep later? They obviously have no idea about how toddlers function. If she doesn't get in the pool, she's just going to start running all over the place, playing and making all kinds of noise.

If anything, the toddler swimming provides an excellent outlet for early morning energy that likely results in the toddler being calmer and happier all around.
