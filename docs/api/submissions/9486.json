People think it's no big deal, but I don't identify with any nicknames, so it feels like you're intentionally disrespecting me by calling me the wrong name when you use one.\n\nIf OP's husband wants to be called Nicholas, then his name is Nicholas, not Nicky or Nick or Nico.   Calling him Uncle Nicky is just disrespectful, and I find it sad that she's not listening to him.", "Yup. My aunt Michelle is still aunt Shell in my mind even though I know she doesn't like it (I try to correct it, but 20 year habits are hard to break)", "My husband shortened his name ONCE 4 years ago to a two letter abbreviation (think TJ) to accommodate a neighbor who was old and had difficulty pronouncing his foreign name, and now not only does everyone in our neighborhood call him TJ, our kid now goes to the neighborhood school so our kid\u2019s friends and their parents call my husband TJ.  And my husband hates it but \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\nTLDR: Nicknames can absolutely stick", "My sister and I appended -Bob to everyone's name when we were kids. My cousins are still Joe Bob and Billy Bob.", "YOUR USERNAME \ud83d\udc51", "Also it is ADORABLE hearing them trying to pronounce difficult things.", "The way she\u2019s discussing it, it feels like some sort of power play. \n\nLike, come on. If someone introduces themself to you as Nicholas, do you just say \u201cNice to meet you, Nick!\u201d You don\u2019t. Her family is rude on purpose with this.", "I've been bubble since my 7yo niece was old enough to talk; not aunt / aunty bubble, just bubble. It's got nothing to do with my actual name but if my niblings ever stop calling me that I'll cry.", "I\u2019m in my 40s now, and still refer to my aunts as Aunt [Shortened Name]-y. So yeah, don\u2019t just assume the kid will \u201cgrow out of it.\u201d", "He doesn't mind anymore because you wore him down by ignoring his wishes", "Trust me, HE STILL MINDS. He just tells you he doesn't because you are as dense as a piece of pykrete. Just because he doesn't object anymore does not mean he doesn't mind. You have shown you really don't respect him either. Oh it's just something silly, why doesn't he like nicknames. I can give you three freaking reasons.\n\n1. The nicknames were used when he was being bullied. Name nicknames can and have been used by abusive people as a way to even further get under their victim's skin. Anthony wants his full name used but the boss uses Tony whenever he wants to point out a mistake or be a general ass to him.\n2. They were named was/is shared with someone they respected/loved. It is *Samuel,* not Sam or Sammy. He was named after his godfather who made such an impression on his parents that they in turn made an impression on the child and he wants to carry that name with pride.\n3. Identity. Imagine going through not being called by your full name because people are too lazy to add a syllable or two. Jennifer dealing with being called Jenny, Jen when they don't feel like a Jenny or Jen, they feel like a Jennifer. THEY ARE JENNIFER. Their license says Jennifer. Not Jenny or Jen.\n\nStop stepping on that name boundary. He doesn't like nicknames of his name, he told you he doesn't like it, and you all have made him feel like he's the bad guy because 'oh it's just a nickname\\~'. I can almost guarantee that if you were called by everyone a nickname you didn't like, you'd be correcting everyone to put a stop to it because it made you uncomfortable and disrespected you. Why are you allowing and following through disrespecting your husband over a simple simple boundary? What other boundaries has he asked you to respect that you blatantly bulldoze over? YTA.", "No, he GAVE UP. It clearly still bothers him if he corrects other people, you just don\u2019t care about him enough to respect his wishes", "> barely even agreed to let me call him Nico\n\nI don't think your statement that he doesn't mind anymore is really accurate.  It sounds more like you badgered him with the nickname until he just gave up", "That is the impression received by everyone here. At the very least you have no love or respect for him, I suppose hate may be a bit far.", "Yeah because that's what her asshat aunt encourages her to do.  Why are you doing this to him?  And why are you involving a four year old in your creepy games?", "So correct her right back and remind her it\u2019s Nicholas. If being taught to call people\u2019s by their names makes her cry, fine. It\u2019s not going to traumatize her, and being told to call her uncle Nicholas is not going to be her supervillain origin story. She\u2019ll get over it, I assure you. YTA for disrespecting your husband to indulge a 4 year old.", "Yep 100% power move.", "Some people aren\u2019t comfortable with it; like me. It\u2019s not a power play; I really like my name- I got in to learning what names mean and mine really suits me, plus common shortenings of Robyn are Rob, Bob, or Bobbie and I don\u2019t like any of those- I\u2019m a woman and to me they\u2019re boys names. But that\u2019s just my experience.", "You sound like a raging narcissist", "Thanks \ud83d\ude02 I was shocked that it was available and also that I managed to think of it around 17yo lol", "I love that!! Bubble is adorable!!", "My BIL Devang is Uncle Bang and it\u2019s absolutely adorable xD He enjoys it.", "It was her first non mom / dad word and was from a random book I read to her. Idk why it stuck for her but it's my favorite thing \ud83d\ude2d", "That\u2019s not funny. Why do you find this funny?\n\nThis man has literally every person in his life that is supposed to love and respect him either by relation of blood or marriage vows calling him names he does not like.\n\nI fail to see any humor in this whatsoever.", "You are the YTA. If your husband prefers Nicholas, then encourage your niece to call him by that name. It doesn't matter that you call him by a nickname (that's between you and him). It doesn't matter his family calls him by a shortened version (that's between him and them). Just because his name has been shortened before doesn't mean it has to stay shortened. How would you feel if someone called you by a name you didn't like but was like, \"eh, it's still fine.\" Don't you want to make him happy?", "So basically you come from a whole family of AH.", "He doesn\u2019t mind it with my in-laws, it\u2019s everybody else that he doesn\u2019t like it coming from.", "/u/monmon81 \n\nWhat's his special nickname for you? Sounds like something YOU like if you call it special. You are a GIANT ASSHOLE for deciding his \"special\" nickname is something he didn't like, and only begrudgingly took it to make YOU happy. You couldn't  even take the time to come up with something meaningfull to call him. Isn't that the point of a special nickname?", "And you said he originally didn't like it.  But you kept at him anyway.", "Again YOU want...not him...you. YTA", "He doesn\u2019t \u201cmind\u201d or he realized he lost that battle long ago in childhood and was hoping that now that he\u2019s an adult he might actually be able to ask other adults - including his WIFE - to call him what he wants?", "Then everyone else needs to respect his wishes. What does he see in a woman who does not respect him?", "\"it's everybody else that he doesn't like it coming from\" so you decided to be a terrible partner and encourage others to call him a name that YOU KNOW he doesn't like, AND completely downplay and dismiss his feelings because \"he's making a big deal out of nothing\". \n\nYTA YTA YTA and your partner deserves someone who respect him, not a person like you."]}
