You don\u2019t have to be harsh to her, just gently correct her, the same way you would do if she said \u201cUncle Dave\u201d", "Just because you find it adorable doesn\u2019t mean he does. He\u2019s stated repeatedly that he wants you to call him Nicholas and therefore, you should call him Nicholas. YTA.", "YTA. Use the name he likes. I have a coworker who calls me Missy even though I go by Melissa, and I find that so annoying I stopped answering her. My boyfriend goes by Joe but his mom and sister call him Jody.  He tolerates it, but when I asked why he introduced himself as Joe instead, he said it was as because he disliked being called Jody. I can\u2019t imagine calling someone by a name they detest on purpose.", ">I told him she\u2019s only 4 and she will probably grow out of calling him \u201cUncle Nicky\u201d and he was making a big deal out of nothing.\n\nErr, why would she grow out of it when everyone, including you, refer to him as \"Uncle Nicky\" in front of him. What you call him around her, is what she'll identify as his name. Thats how this shit works.  People rarely make up their own names for relatives, they just go with what the others around them are using. \n\nNana is Nana because people call her Nana around the kids.\n\nPa is Pa because people call him Pa.\n\nUncle Dick is Uncle Dick because everyone calls him Uncle Dick around the kids.", "YTA. \n\nIt would be nice as well as considerate if you always call your husband by the name he prefers. \n\nNicholas might be too much for a toddler but at 4 your niece should be good with longer words including names. \n\nSo no need to have a big discussion with your niece.  Just call him Uncle Nicholas when speaking with your niece and she likely will convert over in time.", "YTA. He asked you not to call him that. You are encouraging it. Just use his whole name", "Ehh, YTA but not. Your husband is getting upset over a 4 year for using a nickname.  The likelihood of her being able to say his actual name is pretty slim. So why is he upset? However, you are encouraging by referring to  him as 'Uncle Nicky. Changing the subject doesn't take away the fact that he dislike it.", "[deleted]", "NTA, I have an uncle that I called uncle Rich but then found out he wanted to be called uncle Richard instead. Hopefully it's just a thing of she needs time to get used to calling your husband Nicholas instead like it was for me to call my uncle Richard.", "Exactly. Her justification is she will \"probably\" grow out of calling him that which is bs. I still call my Aunt Elizabeth (fake name but fits) by what I was told to call her as a kid. She's Aunt Liz and always will be no matter how old I am.", "He doesn\u2019t even want to be called Nico. Super AHs all around here.", "I was waffling on this one - because 4 year old - until I read this. You have lived up to your username.", "Also, littles are surprisingly good at learning to pronounce \"difficult\" things. My name is difficult for grown adults to say but my niece could say it by 3. Drove my sister absolutely bonkers that her kid could manage something akin to \"Angelica\" with crystal clarity, but \"Fiona\" (sister's name) sounded like she was gargling peanut butter \ud83d\ude02", "This is correct.  That said, she's *4*, so OP's husband better get used to his name being mangled and gracefully accepting that fact until she's old enough to learn how to say it properly.", "This OP! YTA until you change it!", "If I stop calling him Nico he'll think I'm upset with him and he doesn't mind it anymore.", "That's a huge reach.", "Yeah, I don't get it either.  What possible justification could any of them have for not calling him by his name as wishes?", "agreed", "His wife does not call him Nicholas!  She decided Nicholas was not a good name for her husband, so she browbeat him into letting her call him Nico.", "She'll correct you and say that his name is uncle Nicky most of the time", "She probably wouldn't like it but it would seem to fit her personality better.", "I think that ship has sailed.  And it sank so far off the coast, it cannot be salvaged.", "She is gaslighting her own husband and is passive aggressive as well.  Nicholas really picked a winner.", "Holy yikes.", "Why not just cut to the chase and start calling her \"my b+$ch of an ex wife\"", "It's called being controlling.", "He said it was the look I gave him.", "but it makes him uncomfortable??", "So crossing the someone's personal boundaries is adorable now?", "....  Did you miss the part of the story where now anytime the niece is corrected it makes her cry?", "Accidentally mangled is one thing. Purposefully changed, which is reinforced by all other adults, is going to stick forever. Thats why OP is YTA", "So the bar you set is \u201che doesn\u2019t mind\u201d?  And you think that is a positive spin?", "Excuses. Perhaps you could apologize for calling him something he wasn\u2019t comfortable with, if you\u2019re afraid he\u2019ll think your upset. \n\nLet\u2019s see, checks notes you said he \u201cbarely even agreed\u201d. I\u2019d ask him what he truly wants to be called. I highly doubt he likes being called that. People are allowed to set boundaries for their own damn name. Start respecting your husband. Stop allowing your family to call him nicknames and stop giving excuses.", "The fact that he did mind it but you continued to call him that makes you even more of an AH. Can't wait til his nickname for you is \"Ex wife\".", "Yeah? How sure of that are you?\n\nSure enough to risk years of building silent resentment? That will likely eventually spill out?\n\nThat sure? Is your desire to not honour your spouse's desires in such an important-to-him but trivial-to-you way really that overpowering?\n\nI wouldn't take that bet.", "He doesn\u2019t mind?  Or he knows you don\u2019t care that he doesn\u2019t like it, so it\u2019s not worth fighting about it.  Are you sure you didn\u2019t just wear him down to the point where he deals with something he hates because you refuse to call him what he wants to be called.", "Here's a thought....ask him what he truly would prefer.", "You think he doesn\u2019t. He probably just gave up asking you not to because you so clearly have no respect for him or his boundaries. You sound exhausting, OP. YTA.", "Or maybe it\u2019s more a case if he got tired of telling you to stop YTA", "So, you browbeat him into submission.  Not something to be proud of.", "That's  what talking is for.  Ask him if he's really \"okay\" with it. Ask him if he'd rather be called Nicholas.", "So you continued to stomp on his boundaries so much, he submitted and now it\u2019s just normal. Yeah, that\u2019s not the flex you think it is.", "It's really not from your phrasing. Your husband has consistently, repeatedly requested for you to respect their preference. And you have consistently, repeatedly dismissed that request. You're being disrespectful, which is typically not behaviour that is representative of genuinely caring about someone.", "Is it? His feelings seem to mean nothing to you.", "If you don't hate him, you certainly don't **respect** him or his feelings or his boundaries at all. He wants to be called Nicholas. Start calling him Nicholas. Tell your family to call him Nicholas. Explain to your niece that his name is Nicholas and she should call him Uncle Nicholas **and then enforce that**!\n\nIt's not hard. Start respecting your husband.", "You\u2019re continuing to disregard his feelings. At the very least you must not like or respect him very much", "It's really not. My husband doesn't like people shortening his name either. Out of love and respect for him and his boundaries, I never do. Also, if people do it around me, I correct them. It's rude and shows how little concern and respect you have for your spouse.", "You\u2019re NTA. Your husband needs to chill it\u2019s a nickname. He\u2019s a grown ass man being called the short form of his name by a 4 year old and I\u2019m sure it is adorable. And she probably will grow out of it over time if everyone around her is calling him Nicholas. \n\nI\u2019d imagine he gets called Nick or Nico frequently by those who know less. I\u2019d venture to say more people go by the short form of their name than the full name.", "That's not \"correcting.\" That's \"doubling down.\" It's up to YOU to correct HER.", "yeah you absolutley have to have enouranged her to say that, what do you have against your husband, are you trying to get him to divorce you", "Then you need to correct your niece. And keep doing so until she stops calling him that. YTA for being disrespectful to your husband. My husband hates when his name is shortened I would never allow my family to call him by a name he didn't go by. Even a kid. It stops being adorable when the person who is getting called the wrong thing states they don't like it. Grow up and teach your family to also grow up and learn how to respect people. It's not a good look to let your niece grow up thinking it's ok to call anyone by any name she chooses because her aunt said it was ok to do it because it's adorable.", "She\u2019s 4 years old. You are the adult. Why are you letting her have the final say on his name. It\u2019s up to you to keep (gently) correcting her.", "So you're not only encouraging her to call him that, you're reacting negatively to him when he tries to correct her. You are absolutely the problem here.", "No it\u2019s \u201che doesn\u2019t mind it ANYMORE\u201d so he just eventually gave up trying to convince his spouse to show him respect.", "She already knows.  She just doesn't care.", "It\u2019s not that. When I asked him if I could call him Nico he said if we ever got married I could but not until then so I waited until we were to start calling him it. He hasn\u2019t asked me not to since.", "My in-laws all call him Nick lol", "You just don\u2019t understand the concept of boundaries, do you? I mean, at all. As long as you want to do it or think it\u2019s cute you\u2019ll find a way to rationalize your behavior.", "Why would you even want call him something that makes him uncomfortable? This seems like some weird kind of power play on your part and it\u2019s a really horrible way to treat someone you\u2019re meant to love. Like do you even care about his feelings at all, or do your wants trump everything?", "What was the point of asking him in the first place?  To exert a bit of control?", "I asked because he has a special nickname for me that nobody else calls me so I wanted one for him too."]}
