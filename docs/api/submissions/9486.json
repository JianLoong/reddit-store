Name nicknames can and have been used by abusive people as a way to even further get under their victim's skin.

When I said, \u201chey, I\u2019ve decided I want to go by Sallys-Boneyard from now on\u201d suddenly it was easy for them to make the switch.

Most young kids are willing to not be jerks.  Unlike some adults... \n\nI would encourage him to find a nickname that you hate and tell your niece that you'd really love to be called that name.  Actually, I'd ask EVERYONE in the family to do so... given what a jerk you've been to him, they might be game for it.", "Yes, you are the A.  Why don't you support you husband?  What if he did something similar to you?  Geez.", "YTA. Don't call people things they don't like.", "YTA. My eldest sister started calling my grandmother Grandma Honey because she couldn\u2019t pronounce her real name. We never grew out of it. In fact, it\u2019s so ingrained in us to call her that that we still struggle to call her by her real name despite being an openly conservative bigot. \n\nThese nicknames start young. She\u2019s not going to grow out of it as much as she\u2019ll grow into it. Start using Uncle Nicholas around your niece. It might seem small, but it\u2019ll show her there\u2019s other names she can and should use", "YTA. You have no respect for your husbands wishes.  This one thing and you think it is trivial. Going against his wishes because you think the name is cute.", "Well Fuck me, all the people voting YTA would not want to live in Australia as everybody's name gets shortened or if your name is short it will be made longer, and then you will have a few nicknames. \n\nI think you are NTA and you husband needs to get a thicker skin, she is 4 years old.", "YTA.  I have a name that people like to shorten or lightly butcher and I hate it, so I feel for your husband.  You say you aren\u2019t encouraging it but you are!  You are his wife, supposedly his partner; you should have his back, not encourage something he hates because you think it\u2019s \u201cadorable\u201d.  Apologize and start correcting your niece, kindly and gently.", "YTA he wants to be called one name and you and others insist on calling him others. Suck it up and address him as he likes to be called.", "Be proactive. You know you are encouraging this because you think it's cute. Not DIScouraging it is ENcouraging it.  Kinda like lying by omission.\n\nMaybe you just enjoy pissing off your husband. Because you are actively and knowingly doing it. Which you are WELL aware of.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. I have no words for this. How do you fail to see how you\u2019re totally in the wrong??", "Call people ONLY by what they have stated they are comfortable being referred to as, end of story. YTA.", "You are deliberately being disrespectful. He doesn't like being called that. Would you like it if he started to encourage her to call you something he knows you hate? Knock it off. YTA.", "NTA. He is. She\u2019s 4, he\u2019s gotta chill out. She could be calling him much ruder names.\n\nI\u2019d call him in \u201cuncle nothing\u201d after this tbh", "I\u2019m gonna say ESH. I have a name typically shortened, even though I prefer to be called by my full name, I don\u2019t jump down people\u2019s throats if they use a nickname version of my name. I\u2019m comfortable enough in my own skin to not let  it affect me I guess, and my sister goes by aunt \u201ccookie\u201d sooooo\u2026. It just isn\u2019t something worth wasting energy being upset about in my opinion. Nitpicking at something that you KNOW bugs someone though is just messed up. Respecting others is something that should have been learned in Kindergarten.", "YTA. \nYou do not need to correct your daughter when she calls him that, however by joining in, you are definitely encouraging her to keep saying it. You are essentially teaching her that it is his name because she can hear you saying it too. \nIf you just called him uncle Nicholas when referring to him, it would show her that Nicky is not his name. \n\nShe is never going to stop saying it if people around her say it too. \nShe is young and impressionable, she\u2019ll pick up on what people around her say. Especially names.", "Uncle Nicky is going to stick unless you make an effort to change it. My mother legally changed her name before my cousins or I we\u2019re even born, but because her brother (their dad) didn\u2019t make an effort, they still sometimes slip and call her auntie (birth name).", "YTA hard core. Why the heck did he have to compromise to be Nico with you if he hates all shortened versions of his name!? That right there solidified for me that you don\u2019t care enough to respect him. You call people what they want to be called especially your husband. And when someone calls him something else you make sure to call him Nicholas. Your niece is 4. She\u2019s going to call him what everyone else does. You don\u2019t even have to correct her. Just say Uncle Nicholas got it for her and she\u2019ll figure it out.", "\u201cHis big argument is that since I KNOW he doesn't like if, I should be encouraging her to call him Nicholas instead.\u201d  he is right. YTA. You know he doesn't like being called anything other than his full name and you aren't respecting him.", "YTA. My husband has two nicknames from his name, I only call him by one. It's what he prefers.\n\nWhen you know full well your significant other wants to be called a specific name, you respect it. Badgering him until he \"barely agreed to let you call him\" another name, is so rude to me. Why would you want to make him uncomfortable enough to give in? What were you doing that he caved even though he clearly doesn't like it?\n\nBesides all that, your brother-in-law also calls him by a nickname to act like they're close? And everybody is letting an impressionable child tag along? Why does NOBODY in this room respect boundaries (besides the kid, because she doesn't know better)? He has every right to decide who calls him what, if he doesn't want to be called Nicky, you keep correcting and saying his chosen name until she catches on. It's that simple. It doesn't take much effort.\n\nI'm trying to figure out what the actual issue is here on your end.", "YTA\nWhy would you encourage your niece to call him by a name he doesn\u2019t like? Her age has nothing to do with it. Children repeat exactly what they hear. When he starts to ignore anyone screwing up his name, including your niece, you\u2019ll put a stop to it.", "You think its adorable? Well ok then, that settles it right?\n\nYTA, do better.", "YTA. You know he hates it, so why are you keeping it going?? And the nickname developed at 4 yrs old will absolutely last until your niece is 100 lol it\u2019s not a thing you grow out of so it should be corrected now", "ESH", "YTA. Can he shorten your name to bitch? Might as well, neither are the correct names for people.", "Can we also talk about how using someone\u2019s preferred name is the most basic sign of respect? This isn\u2019t a difficult concept. \n\nAnd yes, OP, YTA.", "yup YTA for sure. I also noticed that line about \"barely even agreed to let me call him Nico\" which was super awkward.", "Worse than that, OP appears to find it funny. Honestly, I would have lost my shit in his place by now. This is so fundamentally disrespectful.\n\nOP, stop being a dick and try being on your husband's side. It's not about you. It's about him. And your intentional disregard for something that you know upsets him really doesn't reflect well on you.", "YTA\n\nJust seconding this, my cousins started calling my mother by a nickname when they were this age because they couldn't pronounce her name. They STILL call her by that nickname, and they're all in their late 40's/early 50's now. The nickname will stick if she keeps calling him that.\n\nNot to mention, what if when the niece gets older and realises her uncle hates the nickname, and she starts feeling bad about it? It's a lose/lose situation if the nickname sticks, really.", "Yeah I hate having a nickname of my name and always correct people on it. It's really annoying when people don't listen to you about your own name.", "Yep. My niece and nephew still call me by the nickname they gave me. And so do their children. 43 years snd counting.", "Completely off topic but related.\n\nI have an uncle that is the third in his name line. When he was born, both predecessors were still alive so we called him by his initials which are clunky- think \"GC\" (not actual, but close). However, since we say it all the time- we could say it really fast- and most of our (the neice's and nephew's) spouses thought we were saying \"Uncle Itchy\" which is wayy funnier but he hated it (we corrected them right away, but it was a while before anyone noticed that they said it incorrectly).\n\nNow his father and grandfather have passed- he goes by his given name. But immediate family gets a pass- we introduce him as \"This is my Uncle GC, you can call him Gary, though\" to not make other's confused but also not to encourage other people to call him anything but his preferred name.\n\nMy Dad is a Jr. They both went by \"Bert\" which is Hella confusing so the family calls my dad \"Berty\" which for the longest time I thought was \"Birdy\" because he liked birds.\n\nAdditionally, my wife hates her full name and only answers to the shortened version. And I refuse to answer if she uses my middle name.\n\nBut OP is YTA- you get to be called whatever you want even your spouse shouldn't dictate what you want to be called. I think it's lowkey asinine that she even talked him into \"Nico\". Like- No, you get to use his full name if that what he wants. \n\nDoes he have a problem with Nicknames? Maybe OP should respect this boundary with a compromise- like \"Hon\" or \"Babe\"", "Yes and YES! This is perfection!", "Is it? You husband set a clear boundary regarding something he feels strongly about & you just completely disregard. Hate is a strong word but it at minimum shows a lack of respect for your partner.", "He won\u2019t think you\u2019re mad at him if you  1) first apologize for being such an intransigent asshole for so long and that you\u2019re genuinely trying to turn over a new leaf by finally \u2014 FINALLY! \u2014 respecting his wishes on this; and 2) truly stop messing with him by mangling his name.\n\nThe fact that this business with the four year old went far enough that she cried, and you STILL won\u2019t freaking drop it.", "Exactly. In my house we just got told \u201chey, your grammy actually wants to be called Grandma,\u201d but if OP doesn\u2019t want to lose cool aunt privileges she could wait for her niece to forget about the crying episode and spin calling him Uncle Nicholas as something cool and mature now that she\u2019s talking well enough to not need a nickname. \n\n\u201cYou want to know a special grown-up secret? Your Uncle Nicky is actually your Uncle Nicholas! Shocker, right? I bet if you asked nicely he would let you use his special grown-up name\u2026 \ud83d\ude09\u201d Everybody wins.", "Exactly!!!!!!!", "The point is that it doesn't matter how anyone else feels. If I find what you call me offensive or irksome and ask you to stop, you should stop.  The point is that offense,  like pleasure, is an individual perspective.\n\nYour argument, \"it's not that bad ,\"negates the victim. It's not up to you to decide what is and is not offensive or the degree of offense.\n\nI intentionally used this analogy to make this point.", "Because OP is disrespectful and teaching a 4 year old to be equally disrespectful.", "So my dad hates when people called him Ronnie. Still does. The only people who were allowed to call him that were his mother, younger sister, and younger brother. Two of whom are now dead. So him saying it's okay for your in-laws to call him that does not give you the right to disrespect that! \n\nIt's not your place to force him to be okay with being called Nick or Nicky by anybody else but the people he allows to. By doing this and not correcting it with your niece shows that you have zero respect and don't care about his feelings on the matter. Keep this up and he'll be your ex husband soon! YTA!!", "I have an alternative spelling- my Dad's family always spells it the \"Traditional Catholic Way\". \n\nOne time, I sat my great grandparents down and said \"Hey. I am the illigimate child of a Pentecostal Woman and a gay man- there is nothing Traditionally Catholic about me and pretending there is is disrespectful to me and your religion. So- stop it.\"\n\nMy name is 3 letters- if you spell it Traditionally, 1/3 of my name is incorrect. I asked my GGMa if she would like it if we started calling her Posie instead of Rosie? She said she would not like that. I said \"Oh. So you get it. Cool.\"", "No, her husband came from a whole family of AH. He married an AH because it made him feel at home, I guess.", "Tbh- \"Beth\" is the superior shortened version of Elizabeth.", "YTA. Family is different. My name is Angela, and if you call me Angie after I correct you, I will stab you in the eyeballs.\n\nMy mom calls me Angie, and that is perfectly acceptable. \n\nCall people what they want to be called. You are not his parent, therefore, respectfully, you call him by the name he requests.", "Speaking as someone who hates the nickname my mum calls me (and thus my sister gets away with calling me too, and her kids too) HE DOES MIND", "Why did you marry someone you can't even give the basic respect to not call them by a name they don't like?", "My exhusband called/calls me that.  \ud83d\ude11"]}
