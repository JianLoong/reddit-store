{"id": 2210, "submission_id": "yu6k06", "title": "AITA For not taking care of my sisters baby?", "selftext": "\nI know the title sounds awful\u2026but no other way to say it. Also, I\u2019m writing this on mobile so excuse errors. \n\nI, 18f have a sister 24f who just gave birth to my nephew who\u2019s about 3 months old. To preface the situation, I do not know how to properly care for a baby, the formula ratios, how to change and clean them, nothing. I have no experience with children at all. To the story:\n\nMy sister comes to my moms house (where I live) to ask my mom to watch the baby for a while so she can go get some groceries. I tell her that my mom isn\u2019t home and won\u2019t be until late since she was part of a friends wedding party. My sister then asks me to watch the baby, and I tell her that while I can keep a physical eye on the baby, I\u2019m ill equipped to actually take care of him. I ask my sister if he\u2019s been fed and changed and she says yes, so I agree to watch the baby for an hour while she goes to the store.  I reiterated before she left that I would not be feeding, changing, wiping or otherwise tending to the baby, only to watching him while he laid in his car seat. This way, my sister would be back before he needed anything. \n\nMy sister was gone for 2 hours, and the baby started to get fussy so I called her. She asked me to watch him for another 3 hours while she got her nails done, and I reminded her that I have no idea WTF I\u2019m doing and I can\u2019t get him to stop crying. At this point the baby is screaming and I\u2019ve tried everything I know how, even a sloppy attempt at a diaper change.  So I tell my sister that I\u2019d be calling the police for neglect, as she expected me to take care of a baby and I\u2019ve barely even held kids in my life.  \n\nMy sister rushes to my moms house and calls me an AH for not taking care of the baby, says I\u2019m lazy and if I was a decent aunt, I\u2019d be trying to learn how to help. I kind of feel bad, because I know new moms don\u2019t get enough time to themselves and my sisters husband works a lot to support them both\u2026but I genuinely don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing with a baby. AITA here?\n\nEDIT: I see a lot of people saying the car seat isn\u2019t safe for sleeping, and I\u2019m not sure but it\u2019s one of those stroller thingies that turns into a car seat that turns into a sleeping thingy? It was fixed to be safe for sleep before I took the baby, according to my sister. Also, he wasn\u2019t left in there for hours, because after about 45 minutes he woke up and started to fuss, at which point I rocked him and he fell back asleep on me. At hour and 30 minute mark was when he started getting really upset, and I called my sister 15 mins after because he wouldn\u2019t stop. \n\nAlso, changing a diaper seemed simple enough, and I would\u2019ve been successful if I had a normal diaper, but my sister has some crazy new tech cloth diaper with like 4 straps\u2026I had never seen it before and thus would not know how to put it on. \n\nYes, I know how to hold a baby and about the neck. Give me more credit jeez \ud83d\ude02\n\nAlso I DID GO ON YOUTUBE!! Do you think I wanted the baby to be screaming in my ear? I actually DID go online and try to look up how to do formula properly but I didn\u2019t have anything to mix it with and according to the internet the bubbles give them stomach issues when you shake the bottle, and you can\u2019t leave clumps and if your water isn\u2019t filtered it\u2019s bad, and I don\u2019t have a water filter in my house\u2026and then I saw all the warnings on the back of the formula can and I was like you know what\u2026.idk wtf I\u2019m doing. \n\nI\u2019m more than willing to learn - I have no issue with babies. My sister knows this.\n\nUPDATE 2: My mom came home from the wedding and I told her what happened. She put me in the car and took me to my sisters house. My mom yelled at my sister, called her a terrible mother, told her if anything like this ever happened again she\u2019d be calling the police and made her apologize. I also found out that my sister KNEW my mom wasn\u2019t available and her whole plan was to trick me into watching the baby. My sisters husband was FURIOUS at her, and also apologized to me. I spoke with my sister and mom and BIL and we\u2019re getting my sister evaluated for PPD (because leaving your baby with an incapable teen is so irresponsible she must be crazy - husbands words not mine) and I\u2019ll be actually learning how to help with the baby. \n\nThanks for all the kind words!", "created_utc": 1668357086, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yu6k06/aita_for_not_taking_care_of_my_sisters_baby/", "score": 7642, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You should never have agreed if you are incapable of reading instructions or even googling", "NTA", "NTA. Good for you. You gave all the right warnings. She's completely in the wrong and a negligent mother, not to mention a bad sister. If she wants you to learn to help, then (a) you need to agree to that, and (b) she needs to SHOW you what to do. She just put her baby in danger, leaving it with someone who isn't experienced or qualified. You're doing good, NTA.", "Nta - so if her partner works 8 hours per day (let\u2019s assume) the mum wants to leave the baby with someone else, who\u2019s incapable of looking after them for 5 hours! What?! That\u2019s wild. Anyone that\u2019s saying your the arsehole has taken your gender to heart, if you were an 18 year old little brother I doubt the role of looking after the baby would be pushed on you so heavily. But I will say, maybe your sister is struggling as that\u2019s a long time for a three month old baby", "NTA\n\nAs a mom I would never leave a 3 month old with someone who has no idea what they are doing and is not comfortable (I wouldn\u2019t leave any child with someone like that let alone a 3 month old!). What makes everything worse is that she lied about the length of time she was leaving you. When we get babysitters we are always home by the time we tell them. \n\nBabies are hard work and I get needing the break but she should have waited for someone who was actually able to watch her child to do so", "NTA\n\nYour sister pressured you into watching her baby when you tried to tell her no, then lied to you about how long she'd be gone. She abandoned and neglected her child.\n\nSince you know she will do this, now, I would tell her very firmly in the future that she won't even get an hour and that she's entirely broken your trust and taken advantage of you.\n\nHow awful for that poor kid that their mom is willing to leave them for hours in the care of someone she knows doesn't know what they're doing, just so she can get her nails done.", "NTA this is how you never get your nails done when they aren\u2019t babies anymore", "NTA\n\nYou made it clear that you cannot care for a 3 month old baby. She acknowledged you cannot, nor feel comfortable caring for a 3 month old baby. No mother who actually cares for their infant would leave their child in the care of someone who says bluntly, \"I do not know how to care for an infant. Nor am I comfortable with attempting to care for them.\" And she still does! And not only that, after you both agreed that would you watch the baby for 1 hour, she's gone for WAY longer than that and expects you to watch her baby for another 3 hours so she can get her nails done. Seriously? She obviously was lying about going to the grocery store. It's pretty clear she just wanted to dump her kid on someone else so she could have a day out or something, and didn't want to pay for a baby sitter. \n\nHonestly, I would've called her after the first hour was up and she wasn't back, and that if she wasn't back within the next hour I was calling CPS.", "NTA, you were kind enough to agree to watch your nephew for ONE hour and your sister decided she wanted to go out for FIVE hours despite the fact that you told her you wouldn\u2019t be feeding/changing because you don\u2019t know how. That\u2019s neglectful. I get if she needs a break, but she needs to leave her baby with someone who is willing and able to take care of him and be honest about how long she\u2019s out.", "NTA. But some people are not supposed to have children. Like your sister for example.", "NTA. \n\nShe lied and took advantage.  She left her kid with someone (you) who made it clear they were not prepared to deal  with a baby. \n\nDon\u2019t feel bad.  Moms know how much time they will get before they have a kid. She wasn\u2019t resting, she was getting her nails done!  At that point it was too much. No.\n\nAlso I note I\u2019m a parent myself and never dumped my daughter on someone. If she needed to shop she could have done it when her husband was home or taken the baby with her. \n\nNo. Just because you have a kid doesn\u2019t mean you can dump it on someone when you want a break. You know before hand that the kid is your responsibility and nobody else\u2019s", "NTA. She lied to you about only being gone for an hour and then went ahead and screwed you over. You did the right thing.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly; I wouldn\u2019t even have offered to \u201ckeep an eye\u201d on the baby. I don\u2019t like babies or kids in general so in my opinion you were generous. But, unfortunately some people who are offered an inch take a mile.", "NTA. She said she would be back soon and lied. NEVER agree to be left alone with the baby again.", "NTA your sister never intended to be back in an hour. She planned to be gone for hours. She lied to you.", "ESH\n\nYour sister sucks for leaving her kid with someone unqualified to care for them. Your sister sucks for coercing you into taking the kiddo for an hour then changing it to several hours. \n\nYou suck for threatening to call the police vs talking to your sister more sternly or calling your mom.", "ESH. Your sister sucks for bait and switching her, you suck for trying to use the police for a personal gain. This is not what police are for, this is not neglect.", "NTA.\n\nYou agreed to watch your sister's baby for one hour, with the caveat that you don't know how to provide care beyond watching the child in their car seat.\n\nShe reneged on her arrangement with you and left you alone much longer than expected.\n\nAnd her solution to learn how to care for a baby is a screeching joke. Yes, you could learn now to care for a baby, but you don't do this by having an infant thrust into your arms and being told to take care of the baby. If she wanted you to care for the baby longer (and if you agreed) she should have shown you how to do the other things associated with caring for her baby.\n\nI wouldn't agree to care for her baby again. I think what she did was absolutely despicable. She agreed for one hour, disappears for two, then when you call to find out where she is, she demands you sit for the baby for three more hours to get her nails done.", "NTA You schedule a babysitter BEFORE you leave to go get your nails done, not AFTER!", "NTA. So your sister preferred to do her nails rather than take care of her baby who needed help?  Wow....", "[removed]", "Ah yes a classic case of \"im gonna het creampied but i fullfill my duties as a parent\"\nGo NC. \n\n\nNTA \n\nOh and yes report her for neglect", "NTA. Your sister had every intention of leaving you with the kid for longer than agreed & lied to you. One doesn't just drop in for a 3 hour nail session, she had an appointment.", "NTA, There's some things in life I that I think can be learned by trial and error, or a quick internet search.\n\nTaking care of a baby is definitely not one of those things.  You'd need to be shown how to do things before being responsible for a baby.", "Nta & because no one else has said it DO NOT LEAVE A BABY TO SLEEP IN A CAR SEAT (not yelling lol just want people to notice). It is unsafe for a baby to be in a carseat outside of the car but even more so if for long periods of time. I know it wasn\u2019t your fault as you didn\u2019t know but please next time you are responsible for any child do not leave them in the car seat", "NTA. That is your sister\u2019s responsibility. You took care of the baby while she went out fir groceries- good. That\u2019s a good way to help sis out. She\u2019s out for a spa day??? No, she can pay for a sitter or leave baby with someone who is willing to take care him. Not just dump him with you after you explicitly told her.", "I mean you are nta here your sister shouldn't try to take advantage and you are in the right to be upset etc. but changing a baby is not rocket science and formula has all instructions on the tin.", "NTA - I feel you here a lot. I am super easily overwhelmed when it comes to babys and kids and thats why I dont babysitt my niece. I am happy to watch her if my sister is in the house with e if she wants to shower or do some cleaning or cooking. But please never ever leave me alone with a baby for the sake of both of us.  \nYou made crystal clear what you can and cant do and she was not respecting your boundaries.", "NTA.  If she were a decent mom, she would bring him over and show/ supervise you  in how to care for him.  Not drop him off with nothing.  She had time to do classes and learn, you did not.  And...she would also honor the time she said she would be back.", "NTA. You agreed to watch your nephew for one hour while your sister got groceries and she ended up trying to take five hours. You told her you were unequipped to take care of a baby's needs and still she tried to leave her child with an inexperienced sitter for that amount of time.", "NTA. You agreed to one hour and let her know that you didn\u2019t know how to take care of the baby beyond just watching it. She tried to take advantage of you and leave you with it for hours. Did she think the baby was going to lay there peacefully for that long? lmfao", "NTA- you made an agreement for an hour she then tried to lie, pressure, and bully you into having 5 hours of free childcare while she got a break. I am a parent. I get it you need breaks and to still take care of yourself this isn\u2019t how you go about it. She shouldn\u2019t just be showing up expecting everyone to be available at her disposal - that\u2019s entitled and off putting behavior on her part that leads to issues. If she wants you AND you also want to be an option for childcare there should be times where you spend time with them so you can learn to change diapers, outfits, his schedule, how to feed, and play with him so you and him are set up for success. But even then she needs to follow through and only be gone for the pre-agreed upon time frame. My guess something else is going on and she is struggling and thought she could go running to your mom to fix it and she wasn\u2019t able to. She then tried to use you to fix it and it didn\u2019t work. She then lashed it because hurt people- hurt people. She also might be upset that you aren\u2019t as involved or family isn\u2019t as involved as she imagined. You need to talk to her once everyone is calm", "NTA One hour turned to two and she tried to make it five. She\u2019s an AH for just coming over to dump the baby on y\u2019all\u2019s mom in the first place.

I would refuse to watch him again.", "**NTA**!!\n\nYour sister tried to take advantage of you by deceiving you on how long she would be and she put her baby at risk, just to get her nails done. \n\nYou did the right thing by threatening to call the police.\n\nEDIT:  Thank you for the awards!", "NTA.\n\nYour sister took advantage of you. Babies aren't toys to be left behind when you want to get your nails done. \n\nAnd nobody teaches you how to be a parent. These things take time. Some people learn quicker than others and very few are just natural. \n\nDon't feel.guilty,  OP, your sister shouldn't have taken advantage of you or lied as to what her plans were. \n\nMaybe there'll come a time when you don't mind changing a nappy or two, if your sister shows you how.", "NTA- you were nice to watch the baby for her for an hour, her expecting you to watch them for longer is an AH move especially when you made it clear you didn\u2019t know what you were doing and we\u2019re not comfortable providing care. What kind of mother leaves their baby with someone who doesn\u2019t know how to take care of it?!", "Nta. Your sister is a major asshole. And just so you know (I know it\u2019s not your baby and don\u2019t expect you to know but your sister sure as hell should) but keeping a kid in a car seat when they\u2019re not in the car is extremely dangerous. You should have your sister look up positional asphyxiation.", "NTA, she lied to you and took advantage. I would never leave my child with someone who didn\u2019t know how to care for babies. Even if you knew what you were doing it would still be NTA. You can\u2019t just toss your kid on someone who has no interest in watching them.", "NTA\n\nYou agreed for 1 hour. And you had stipulations of you are literally only watching the child, not doing anything extra.\n\nShe knew her deadline, missed it, then expected you to care for the child (which you never agreed to) for 3 more hours just so she can have fun and get her nails done (what nail salon takes 3 hours?!). Self care is important, but she knowingly went against your agreement and your stated boundaries to try to do it. Not the time. She can do that when she has found someone to care for the child while she's away.\n\nShe's the asshole, and while threatening the police is extreme, you got the point across and she came back to take the kid. Hopefully she makes better childcare decisions in the future.", "NTA for being upset sister changed plans on you and took longer BUT definitely TA for threatening to call the police for neglect which would then involve cps. Wtf is wrong with you! For starters, since you agreed to watch the baby, you would have been the one charged if it came to that. Brilliant move there Sherlock. Next, you apparently are a sh!t sister to even contemplate such a thing. I rarely say anyone should go NC with family but this just may well be one of those few cases where she just gives you the middle finger and puts you out of her life.", "NTA -- Your sister sounds incredibly entitled, even if you had the skills to look after a baby bumping a 1 hour visit up to 5 hours is just an awful move. \n\nJust to double check something though: Is your sister always doing favors for you? That might color things slightly if she bends over backwards for you all the time, and this is the one time she asks something in return. Maybe she would have an expectation you would try to help, but somehow I doubt this. The fact that she didn't even check if your mom was available before coming over to hand off her child reeks of selfishness.\n\nEdited to fix the grammar.", "NTA. You set expectations and so did your sister. One hour, \"I don't know what I'm doing, and \"I don't feel comfortable doing anything but literally watching the baby\" were all things SHE agreed to. She broke the agreement by extending herself by four hours for something unnecessary. She had to know that meant you would obviously have to do some care for her child, when she already knew you were uncomfortable/didn't know what to do, because you told her exactly that. \n\nI don't fully understand other people telling you to \"google it\", as though that's enough to learn how to fully care for an infant that isn't yours. Although I think it was maybe a bit harsh to threaten calling the police for neglect (unless she has a history of doing this), if your sister wants someone to take care of her baby, she should hire someone. I would hate to see you become the default babysitter as your sister continues to navigate motherhood because you didn't establish these boundaries when the opportunity was there. \n\nNeeding groceries is one thing, but tacking on an additional four hours to get your nails done is another (if she can afford a three hour nail appointment, she can afford a sitter). One is necessary and the other is optional, if she wanted to get her nails done she should have been honest about that in the beginning, or at least called to ask if that's ok.\n\nYou did your sister a favour and she took advantage.\nAgain, because I hate that you feel bad for being tricked into almost a full day of child care, NTA.\n\nEdited for clarity.", "Nta \nUr sister was gone for 2 hours and wanted u to watch the baby for 3 more if I'm being honest u did the best thing you could do at that moment you made it clear to your sis what u would and would not do for the kid", "ESH. Your sister for obvious reasons.\n\nYou're 18 and can't figure out what to do in this situation besides \"call the police\"? How about call your mom, call a friend? Have you never seen a movie that had a baby in it? \n\nI never held a baby until I had my own.  I could still have managed to deal with one if necessary. It's not like defusing a bomb.", "NTA\n\nYou 100% did the right thing and I'm actually amazed (in positive sense) of how you handled the situation", "NTA. I was wondering why she needed to leave her baby with you if she was just going grocery shopping. I took my kids everywhere with me when they were babies because I had no sitters. It made a whole lot more sense when you said she was getting her nails done. She already had that planned but because your mom wasn\u2019t home, she didn\u2019t want to tell you the truth so that you\u2019d have no choice but to watch her baby. She totally took advantage of you in this particular situation.", "NTA. You told her your stipulations for watching the baby. She was trying to take advantage of you by pushing how long she was out. \n\nAnd why the heck does it take 3 hours to get her nails done!?!", "You and sister agreed to 1hr. Any point past that 1hr where sister is not actively on her way back you could consider abandonment (and neglect since you're not qualified and she knows it) and call the cops or CYS/CPS, whatever service it is where you are. \n\n5 hours is excessive, baby could have died. \n\nOne school I work at will call for parents with a pattern of being 1hr late to picking up their kids. You are not a school and can call for less.", "NTA.  She said an hour.  You agreed to an hour.

She\u2019s a bad mother.", "I swear I have seen this posted before. Right down to sister being at a nail appointment\u2026", "NTA\n\nShe was extremely irresponsible. Kudos to you for being willing to chip in at all and try and be a kind and helpful sibling.", "NTA. My sister used to pull this crap on me when we lived together and she just had her oldest daughter.

You\u2019re right - formula type, ratio, prep method are all particular things that mothers usually fret over. It\u2019s very unusual for her to have left her baby for five hours without prepped bottles and with some one who says she doesn\u2019t know how to prepare the baby\u2019s food. Babies eat more than once every five hours - so she was okay with the baby going hungry? Not normal!", "NTA but your sister is for leaving her infant with someone who thought it was okay to just leave them in the car seat for an hour.

Situations like this come from attitudes like that\u2014\u201cit\u2019s my sister, it\u2019s her nephew, so she SHOULD watch him, it\u2019s basically partially her responsibility too and if she doesn\u2019t want to she\u2019s selfish because she knows I barely get time to myself\u201d. \n\nI\u2019m glad you stood your ground.", "NTA. You made it clear from the start that you were inexperienced with infants and your sister needed to be back in an hour or less, before the child needed tending.

I was a single mom, too, with very little help, but you don\u2019t just drop your child off, pressure someone into watching them, and then just run off for five hours hoping to impose even more time on them. Especially a 3 month old baby. They are still eating every couple hours then, so that\u2019s lots of bottle and lots of diapers. AND she has cloth diapers with straps? I wouldn\u2019t even know how to work that. What she did was neglectful and borderline abusive. It was abusive towards you. I remember when I was young baby sitting for this couple with like SIX kids, two still in diapers (also cloth), and they told me \u2018a couple hours\u2019 while they went to church choir practice. \n\nSIX HOURS LATER they finally get home at midnight. One of the babies cried non-stop unless I was holding him the WHOLE time. I was making $2/hr and was like 13 and I was so pissed! Baby stopped crying and went to sleep like 15 minutes before they got home, and that pissed me off even more because I wanted them to come home to a crying baby. It was legit psychological torture! \n\nEdit: you are NTA, but your sister sure is!", "Your sister is a jerk. You should never have been put in this situation.

What was she thinking? That the baby would sleep for 5 hours, no of course not, but she didn't care. \nPS: the nails looked oki?", "NTA. \n\nI leave detailed instructions for anyone watching my kids, even if they\u2019ve watched them before.

I don\u2019t know a single mom who would even be happy to be separated from their 3 month old for that amount of time. Maybe sis is dealing with some PPD, but she\u2019s definitely TA for leaving her newborn alone with someone who admittedly has no idea how to care for one.", "ESH\n\nI'm sorry to those who disagree, but if you're not comfortable feeding the baby or changing a diaper, you're an AH for saying yes to watching said baby. Even for just an hour. Frankly, you should have just said No (as often as needed, because I get the feeling your sister would have kept pushing the issue).\n\nAs a parent, I never- NEVER- would have left my kid with someone uncomfortable with feeding or changing my kid. Your sister using you as a babysitter was highly irresponsible.", "NTA, she\u2019s a liar, and a bad mom because you are inexperienced.\n\nMy older sister is the same way. She has four kids, and we all decline to help watch them because she isn\u2019t honest when she asks for you to watch them.\n\nAn hour at the store for her becomes several hours of store, visiting friends, going to appointments that she told no one about, etc. The last time I babysat for her it was for an hour for her to cash her check, she didn\u2019t get home until midnight, several hours later. She went shopping, and then went out clubbing - and I missed work because of it.\n\nIf you\u2019re not honest about what you\u2019re doing, don\u2019t expect help.", "Nta. It's not your kid. She chose to have it. She gave up her free time for 18+ years. This is why i can't stand parents,  so many of them just take any chance to dump their kid on you and say they'll be back in an hour, and its never an hour. That is her kid,  it's her problem. Dont let her take advantage of you.", "NTA. If you are willing to learn, have your mom teach you when she watches the baby. Then charge your sister the going rate for child care in your area. She is going to have to learn how to do things with baby because there won't always be someone available to watch him.", "NTA", "ESH\n\nI think you should\u2019ve just said no tbvh. Why agree to something you\u2019re clearly uncomfortable with? You could\u2019ve avoided the situation entirely by declining. Never agree to this type of situation. A baby is not something you can get away with \u201cpartially\u201d watching.

You didn\u2019t neglect the baby, in fact you truly tried your best with what you were given. You held them, comforted them, tried to change their diaper (I commend you for that one, cloth diapers are confusing as hell sometimes.)

I understand the groceries part, but she even snuck in a nail appointment there. Very irresponsible. Was she hoping that her mom would be back by then?", "NTA. I wouldn't have left my kid with someone for 15 minutes without making sure they were prepared for any eventuality.", "NTA. After spending time with my nephews, I understand the struggles of stay at home parents. But your sister had no right to deceive you in order to get her moment of rest.", "You are NTA.

The part where she said \"you gotta watch her for 3 more hours I'm getting my nails done\" is where I would have drawn the line too.\n\nSHE is the mom. Not you lol.

Yes, I'm calling her the AH here.", "NTA at all!! the sister knew that you had no knowledge about babies and yet thought it was a good idea to get her nails done for 3 hours, it\u2019s irresponsible to leave your child with someone who doesn\u2019t know how to take care of children. also, if she could afford new tech diapers & a 3 hour nail appointment, wouldn\u2019t she be able to afford a baby sitter? or at least drop him off at a daycare center?", "NTA\n\nSo, she didn't know your mom was at a wedding. Does she talk to your mom at all? Does your mom sometimes babysit? \n\nWas this the first time that your sister ever dropped her kid off with someone?\n\nHonestly, it sounds like you were trying. But sometimes babies just cry for no reason, and how are you supposed to know the difference between her hungry cry, her fussy cry, her gassy cry, her nappy cry, or her \"I just want mommy!!!\" cry? \n\nI understand new moms wanting some time to just sit in a quiet space and be a person independent of their child. I'm a mom. And sometimes it's nice to just sit in the car for a few minutes before going inside. I love when my kids run up to me yelling \"mama! mama!\" But it's also nice to just have a few quiet moments to do X, Y, or Z. I understand that. \n\nBut I also call my occasional babysitters in advance. Whether it's my mom, my brother, my in-laws, or a paid sitter, I always call ahead of time. \n\nAnd I make sure that they are comfortable and feel capable of taking care of my kid/s. My FIL has stated that he doesn't feel up to handling 2 kids (one of which is still a toddler) on his own. And I completely respect that. \n\nYou told your sister what you felt comfortable doing. She should have respected that. \n\nAs for being lazy, why didn't she take some time before today to show you how to be a good babysitter? You don't just dump a baby on someone and expect them to be a good caretaker. \n\nI think the best approach here is the apprentice approach. Where an experienced person take an inexperienced teen and shows them how to do things.

If she needed longer I would only do it with supervision, like my husband who adored and knew how to care for babies or my mom. I didn't feel comfortable with babies. \n\nAfter I had my baby, I asked my friend if she can watch my baby while my husband and I interviewed sitters. She felt uncomfortable being alone and I told her my mom was outside sewing if she needed something or call. My husband and I were 2 miles from the house for about an hour. She called that the baby wouldn't stop hiccuping. We told her it was normal, but she called my mom for help. I knew that not to eave her alone when she wasn't comfortable with caring for a baby.

You did nothing wrong here & your sister was bang out of order.", "NTA\n\nYou are very right to refuse to take care of the baby, as you have not been taught how. Your sister decided to leave him with you, knowing you could only watch him, and not take care of him. I find that neglectful and would worry about your nephews safety. \n\nWhat your sister did is aweful. If she normally is a good human, maybe there's more to it. (I do not know if this could be signs of depression or the likes of it, but would ask a doctor)\n\n**At the very least talk to your mom about it,** maybe she can convince your sister to see her doctor.\n\nElse you may need to rapport her for neglect, to protect your nephew.

And what's with parents dropping kids off without consent or dropping a kid off and instead of being back on time going to do whatever they want without a care in the world and then getting mad when they're called out for it. 'It takes a village' doesn't mean that the village has as much responsibility as the parents", "NTA.  The sister was gone for 2 hours instead of one, then wants 3 MORE HOURS to get her nails done?!\n\nThe sister was dishonest, inconsiderate and certainly did no favors for her baby.

Mix the right ratio of water to powder per your formula can instructions, my formula was 2 ounce of water per 1 level scoop of powder. Shake your bottle.

Leaving your baby with someone who doesn't have a clue how to care for them is not really normal new mum behaviour. Is she coping OK? She may need to go to her doctor and get screened for PND. Even if she was OK initially it can kick later for some people.\n\nFor future reference (though hopefully you'll never have the baby dumped on you again) here's some information that may be useful\n\n1) Making milk\n\nThe ratios of formula to water is usually written on the packet, and it comes with a little scoop. It's about 1 scoop per fluid oz or 30ml of water, IIRC. Most baby bottles have measurement markings on the side. \n\nThe older the baby, the more milk they will need. Tiny babies may only need an oz or 2. Bigger/older babies will take up to 7 or 8oz. Your sister should know roughly how much her baby is drinking at the moment.\n\nYou need to boil 1L of water in a kettle (a saucepan is probably OK if you don't have one) and then leave it to cool for 30 minutes to bring the temperature down from 100 to about 70 degrees Celsius. The water needs to be freshly boiled to sterilise the water, but reduced to 70 Celsius to sterilise the formula powder without killing the nutrients in it.\n\nI used to add the water to the bottle, then the scoop the powder in, and stir rather than shake until it was all mixed in. \n\nIf they're freshly made you need to reduce the heat further before giving to the baby, so you run it under a cold tap to bring the temperature down, until it's only warm and not hot. \n\nBut they don't have to be made fresh every time. I used to make bottles in batches and store them in the fridge until they were needed, so if you ever do babysit again ask your sister to make them in advance (formula can also be bought premixed like regular UHT milk, and just needs to be poured into a baby bottle). Reheat by placing in a jug of hot water for several minutes, until the milk is nice and warm. \n\nYou check the temperature by dripping a little onto your wrist. If it feels nicely warm, you are good to go. If it feel either hot or cold, you need to adjust the temperature further. \n\nDon't heat milk for babies in the microwave because it can cause hot spots in the milk that burns their tongues badly.\n\n2) Feeding/burping\n\nBabies will know what to do once you put the bottle in their mouth. You will need to burp them after (sometimes half way through) the bottle. You can do this by sitting them up and supporting their chin in one hand while patting their back with the other, or by lying them up on your chest with their head over your shoulder. You may be surprised how much air a baby can swallow, so keep burping them until they aren't bringing up any more air. \n\nMany babies sick up a little milk while being burped, so cover yourself with a towel or burping cloth while doing this. \n\n3) Changing nappies, esp. cloth nappies. \n\nAfter feeding, many babies will fill their nappies. When they're still only on milk the nappies don't tend to be too bad. It's safest to place the baby on the floor to change them, if you aren't used to it. That way they can't roll off the changing table and hurt themselves. \n\nA few baby wipes, or cotton wool and warm water will take care of cleaning, then pop the used nappy in a bag. Always wipe front to back on baby girls. \n\nCloth nappies are a bit trickier than disposable ones unless you are used to them. There's usually a waterproof layer and an absorbant layer. Sometimes they are attached, sometimes they are separate. Disposable nappies come in different sizes, but reusable ones tend to be adjustable so it grows with the baby. \n\nWhen you are putting them on, anywhere there's a gap between the waterproof layer and the baby's skin (or anywhere you can see the absorbant layer) you might get a leak, so you want to minimise gaps. Sometimes the rise (length) is adjustable with poppers at the crotch. If you can see a lot of the absorbant layer at the leg holes you may need to tighten these poppers (or pull the front and back of the nappy up higher on baby's waist. It should sits a little below the belly button) \n\nThen there tends to be velcro or poppers to fasten at the waist. Make sure the back of the nappy is well up on the baby's back, hold the front of the nappy roughly centred on the baby's tummy, and fasten the poppers or velco as close to the middle as they can go without straining. Fasten one side then the other, and then readjust one at a time as needed if the waistband looks loose or there's a big gap between the nappy and the baby's tummy. It should be snug at the back, but a little gap (a fingerwidth) at the top of the front is OK. \n\n4) That's it.\n\nOnce a young baby (who isn't teething) is fed, burped, and wearing a clean dry nappy they are usually OK until they get tired. They like to be rocked or picked up and patted to sleep. Or if they're still crying they may need more milk, more burping, or another fresh nappy. \n\nBabies are a lot of work though, so although it may be understandable that your sister wanted/needed time away from the baby, what she did to you to get that time wasn't fair. I'm hesitant to say she was an AH though, because I think there may be more going on. \n\nIf she isn't an AH, and is just struggling, I hope your experience hasn't soured babysitting for you completely. Babies can be adorable once they get to three or so months and start interacting more with the world around them \ud83d\ude42\n\nBut if she is just an AH, lay down those boundaries and don't feel obliged to help ever again.", " NTA.

This reminds me of the time when I was babysitting for the very first time ever when I was 14 I think and it was supposed to be for 2 hours max while this woman had a drink with a coworker who was retiring. The baby was about 6 months and sleeping so it was literally just sit there and watch tv. Then apparently she met some rich oil guy in town from Texas and called me from the airport saying she was flying to Dallas with him on his private jet and would be back in a few days. I called my mom freaked out and she came over and we called the lady\u2019s sister to come get the baby. Nuts. So I feel for OP and NTA.", "NTA that edit told me far more then the story did cuz you sound just like me. I haven\u2019t had to be around a baby since I was ten; I\u2019m 31 now(I don\u2019t even know how a diaper WORKS) You tried your best kid. Your sister is an AH who didn\u2019t care and was trying to take advantage of you. She\u2019s just mad it didn\u2019t work. You are a good aunt for not wanting to risk hurting the baby with things you don\u2019t understand.", "As a mom of a current 3 month old you are definitely NTA.

It was only going to be a hour but then she extends it to three hours. Absolutely no way, if you don't know how to look after a baby it can be really dangerous to act as if you do. I can keep an eye on a little baby for an hour provided that they've just had their nappy changed and they've been fed. Any more duties than making sure it's not dead is a big deal to some people.

You still have to figure your life out and don't need the stress of a baby that is not yours.", "Definitely NTA. If your sister is getting burned out or has PPD I hope she gets the help she needs. It\u2019s a lot to handle. You\u2019re not even saying that you aren\u2019t willing to help, like so many on here , just you didn\u2019t know what to do.

You\u2019re going to be a good aunt", "You're definitely NTA. \n\nAs a mother I can't imagine leaving my 3 month old with a person that is so clear that they have no idea how to care for them. That's insane to me. I'm glad your sister is being checked out for PPD, that just doesn't seem like something a caring parent would do. I'm sorry you were put through this, that must have been really stressful and scary for you.", "NTA and glad your mom and BIL have your back. Your sister may have PPD or she maybe just needed a break. You did the best you could and I am glad you're taking steps to learn how to care for your nephew.", "Glad this has sort of been resolved according to your update. Here\u2019s my verdict anyway: NTA. As a mom, I would never leave my child under the supervision of someone who isn\u2019t capable. My son goes to daycare every day. If we need a sitter, our parents are the only people I trust with my child. No teenagers who are just babysitting for extra cash, no random \u201cnanny\u201d from Facebook or something, not even another adult friend. My child is my everything, my world, my love; I will not put him in harms way. \n\nYou are obviously a very caring person and you went above and beyond to try to care for your nephew. \n\nWhat your sister did to you and her son is not your fault. It was a huge mistake on her part as a mother and a big sister. She needs help. She needs to get treatment fast for whatever is going on. None of this is your fault. I hope you are eventually able to forgive your sister for putting you in that position. Hopefully she can see how messed up that was and then she can apologize.", "NTA your sister is though, or she has PPD or she is just not ready to Mom.  It is a real job, it is work, it takes personal growth.", "Super NTA. Your second edit about her being evaluated for PPD seems important.\n\nRaising a kid is hard, my wife and I had hundreds of days when we were desperate for an extra set of hands, but we were also VERY picky about who we would trust our child with.\n\nI don't understand people who think it's their extended family's responsibility to take care of their children. It's not even like she's a teen mom without help, she's 24, married, it sounds like she gets some help from your mom... She's struggling with her own stuff and dumped the problem on you.\n\nPs- grocery shopping is the easiest thing to do with a baby. I used to go to the grocery store just to get some steps in while my newborn slept in the carrier in the cart. This was an absolutely shameless trick to force you to babysit.", "I'm sorry I had to laugh. NAH, I totally understand your panic and your stress, though I do think threatening to get police involved was way too far, and... maybe this is a little tiny wake up call to get more comfortable with the baby to be more useful. Not your job, but always nice when family cares enough to get involved. I also understand that the mother may have just been super excited to finally be doing something alone, and probably thought after easing in you'd relax with the baby, not get more and more stressed. Maybe hope was clouding her judgement on that one. I can't be mad at a mum for getting caught up in having some time to decompress, even if she didn't go about it the right way.\n\nSo NAH, just keep in mind, new mums may be mentally struggling a bit, so try not to be too hard on her for poor judgement. But also, don't beat yourself up, you got really stressed and freaked out a bit... happens to everyone! Just take it as a learning curve and maybe try getting more comfortable to be a useful sister/aunt in this situation.", "Why would she EVER be T A? Calling the police was the correct next step as the mother was abandoning the baby. Yes what that mom was doing is abandonment clear and simple, which neglect sprinkled into the situation too.\n\nETA: judgement NTA even if she called the police", "She became the AH especially when she started yelling at OP. There was no reason for that.", "Where I go doesn't require appointments.  The actual don't take them. Its so popular that they are packed with walk-ins and don't want to waste time for have someone waiting for an appointment...js.  Mom is still an AH cause it can take me two hours to get a 30 min gel (so worth it which is why I budget the time)", "Because that could have resulted in a considerable custody battle for the parent if social services or cps became involved and given it's a family member making the concerend call would have taken it very seriously....she clearly didn't abandon the child dont be melodramatic....she just took advantage of her sister and stayed out a few hours longer than she said she would...getting the police or any other agency involved is a massive over reaction.....so had she of called the police  and/or child service then she would have been the ashole", "Are we not being vocal enough to women (and men) before they get pregnant that babies are a 24/7 responsibility and there are no days off?  Are we not being clear about how exhausting it is?  \n\nAre they just looking at instagram and the cute baby pictures and going, \"Awww!  I want a baby!\"?

Wow, I cant imagine the exhaustion...", "3 hours for nails probably means acrylics, and those generally require an appointment. Without acrylics, even getting both hands and feet done won\u2019t take over 2 hours", "YES the mother DID abandon that baby.the mother left a defenseless baby with someone who expressed they were uncomfortable caring for that baby - neglect on the mother's part. Then AGREED only supervision for 1 hour. The mother abandoned the baby at the 2 hour mark - no I'm running late phone call. Then when the op did call the mother the mother wanted to stay out for another 3 hours - neglect and abandonment. \n\nCPS/Police are the correct people to call on a situation like this.", "I completely disagree with you", "This is also a possibility! Maybe op should talk to her about it, though I\u2019m not sure about it", "You can disagree all you want. But the truth of the matter is what that mother did is considered abandonment and neglect.", "Possible, I would just worry that awkward moment when mid mani the baby starts to be fussy about something and there\u2019s not much you can do with wet nails.", "Again you're wrong, that is not what abandonment means at all...you're being dramatic and having read your previous comments on other AITA posts it's a regular occurrence....", "I mean, I wouldn\u2019t wanna take a baby with me alone for a manicure! \n\nMy cousin and I used to take her baby with us to get our nails done, but we took turns, one of us got our nails done while the other hung out outside with the baby. (the salon was in a nice little strip mall with green areas around it and other shops so whoever had the baby could walk the strip, sit on a bench in the green area and people watch, feed pigeons, go into the coffee shop, whatever. It wasn\u2019t unpleasant in the least)\n\nThen once both of our nails were done we\u2019d get lunch and then go shopping and do our other errands. Thing is, I had experience with babies. I don\u2019t have a baby but I have a lot of younger cousins and have babysat, and I went into it knows that the price of spending the day with my cousin was that I\u2019d likely have to change her infant\u2019s diaper and feed the baby, plus a chance that the baby would cry and need cuddling and soothing. \n\nAlthough her baby was super chill so that was a pretty low chance. And I loved time with her baby, snuggling her was awesome.", "I could try to explain to you how you are wrong.

I always keep bottles mixed up even just for myself, but especially for anyone babysitting.", "That's something to consider, but what mom of a 3 month old wants super intricate (and probably expensive) nails, when they are likely to get ruined pretty quickly from taking care of the baby and I'm guessing house work (it seems like she's a stay at home mom).", "She left her baby with someone who has no idea how to car for a baby, or even feed it, and wanted to be gone for hours.

I'm not sure I'd have had to confidence to do that.", "I agree it\u2019s not abandonment, but it is neglect. As a parent you have the responsibility to make sure your child is well cared for.

Why would you leave your child with someone who doesn't know anything about babies if you love your child? Does she love her child? I'm starting to wonder now. She said it would only be an hour, but she lied to just get her fucking nails done. That's not a necessity.\n\nIf she did want you to babysit and you also wanted to babysit, she should have thought you exactly what to do. Prepared some milk up front and thought you how to change the diapers or what to do when it starts crying. Only if you also wanted that tho. You're not obligated to do so and definitely not without pay. \n\nYour mom and her husband are amazing tho.\n\nAlso, you're also amazing. You're so much more responsible than your sister. You tried to help, but when you realized you weren't able to do so safely, you stopped. You looked up videos and all that, just so you could try. And you stood up for the baby, by threatening to call the police.", "She could have literally spent twenty minutes showing OP how to make a baby bottle and change him before leaving, even if she did really plan on being gone and hour she should have done that.

It was like my body was screaming it at me to get them latched and nursed. It was so odd. It also felt instinctive to hold them as close to my skin as possible and keep them safe and warm. Their diaper felt so weird and any clothing between us felt like i wasnt keeping them warm enough. Just naked top me and naked baby with a blanket over us felt right. Not sure if this is actually instints or anxiety though \ud83e\udd23  as for the post though, NTA sis should have had a day to teach you how to properly care for the baby (if you wanted to learn) before leaving baby with you.
