Also, I\u2019m writing this on mobile so excuse errors. \n\nI, 18f have a sister 24f who just gave birth to my nephew who\u2019s about 3 months old. To preface the situation, I do not know how to properly care for a baby, the formula ratios, how to change and clean them, nothing. I have no experience with children at all. To the story:\n\nMy sister comes to my moms house (where I live) to ask my mom to watch the baby for a while so she can go get some groceries. I tell her that my mom isn\u2019t home and won\u2019t be until late since she was part of a friends wedding party. My sister then asks me to watch the baby, and I tell her that while I can keep a physical eye on the baby, I\u2019m ill equipped to actually take care of him. I ask my sister if he\u2019s been fed and changed and she says yes, so I agree to watch the baby for an hour while she goes to the store.  I reiterated before she left that I would not be feeding, changing, wiping or otherwise tending to the baby, only to watching him while he laid in his car seat. This way, my sister would be back before he needed anything. \n\nMy sister was gone for 2 hours, and the baby started to get fussy so I called her. She asked me to watch him for another 3 hours while she got her nails done, and I reminded her that I have no idea WTF I\u2019m doing and I can\u2019t get him to stop crying. At this point the baby is screaming and I\u2019ve tried everything I know how, even a sloppy attempt at a diaper change.  So I tell my sister that I\u2019d be calling the police for neglect, as she expected me to take care of a baby and I\u2019ve barely even held kids in my life.  \n\nMy sister rushes to my moms house and calls me an AH for not taking care of the baby, says I\u2019m lazy and if I was a decent aunt, I\u2019d be trying to learn how to help. I kind of feel bad, because I know new moms don\u2019t get enough time to themselves and my sisters husband works a lot to support them both\u2026but I genuinely don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing with a baby.

You did not agree to watching him for more than an hour, he is not your responsibility.", "NTA. you agreed for an hour. honestly kind of wild she thought it was ok to make new plans to get her nails done knowing her child is with someone who doesn\u2019t know how to properly care for HER baby. it was nice of you to watch her baby while she went grocery shopping though.", "YTA. Your sister is for agreeing to an hour but staying longer but you are for not putting in any effort. You should never have agreed if you are incapable of reading instructions or even googling", "NTA", "NTA. Good for you. You gave all the right warnings. She's completely in the wrong and a negligent mother, not to mention a bad sister. If she wants you to learn to help, then (a) you need to agree to that, and (b) she needs to SHOW you what to do. She just put her baby in danger, leaving it with someone who isn't experienced or qualified. You're doing good, NTA.", "Nta - so if her partner works 8 hours per day (let\u2019s assume) the mum wants to leave the baby with someone else, who\u2019s incapable of looking after them for 5 hours! What?! That\u2019s wild. Anyone that\u2019s saying your the arsehole has taken your gender to heart, if you were an 18 year old little brother I doubt the role of looking after the baby would be pushed on you so heavily. But I will say, maybe your sister is struggling as that\u2019s a long time for a three month old baby", "NTA\n\nAs a mom I would never leave a 3 month old with someone who has no idea what they are doing and is not comfortable (I wouldn\u2019t leave any child with someone like that let alone a 3 month old!). What makes everything worse is that she lied about the length of time she was leaving you. When we get babysitters we are always home by the time we tell them. \n\nBabies are hard work and I get needing the break but she should have waited for someone who was actually able to watch her child to do so", "NTA\n\nYour sister pressured you into watching her baby when you tried to tell her no, then lied to you about how long she'd be gone. She abandoned and neglected her child.\n\nSince you know she will do this, now, I would tell her very firmly in the future that she won't even get an hour and that she's entirely broken your trust and taken advantage of you.\n\nHow awful for that poor kid that their mom is willing to leave them for hours in the care of someone she knows doesn't know what they're doing, just so she can get her nails done.", "NTA this is how you never get your nails done when they aren\u2019t babies anymore", "NTA\n\nYou made it clear that you cannot care for a 3 month old baby. She acknowledged you cannot, nor feel comfortable caring for a 3 month old baby. No mother who actually cares for their infant would leave their child in the care of someone who says bluntly, \"I do not know how to care for an infant. Nor am I comfortable with attempting to care for them.\" And she still does! And not only that, after you both agreed that would you watch the baby for 1 hour, she's gone for WAY longer than that and expects you to watch her baby for another 3 hours so she can get her nails done. Seriously? She obviously was lying about going to the grocery store. It's pretty clear she just wanted to dump her kid on someone else so she could have a day out or something, and didn't want to pay for a baby sitter. \n\nHonestly, I would've called her after the first hour was up and she wasn't back, and that if she wasn't back within the next hour I was calling CPS.", "NTA, you were kind enough to agree to watch your nephew for ONE hour and your sister decided she wanted to go out for FIVE hours despite the fact that you told her you wouldn\u2019t be feeding/changing because you don\u2019t know how. That\u2019s neglectful. I get if she needs a break, but she needs to leave her baby with someone who is willing and able to take care of him and be honest about how long she\u2019s out.", "NTA. But some people are not supposed to have children. Like your sister for example.", "NTA. \n\nShe lied and took advantage.  She left her kid with someone (you) who made it clear they were not prepared to deal  with a baby. \n\nDon\u2019t feel bad.  Moms know how much time they will get before they have a kid. She wasn\u2019t resting, she was getting her nails done!  At that point it was too much. No.\n\nAlso I note I\u2019m a parent myself and never dumped my daughter on someone. If she needed to shop she could have done it when her husband was home or taken the baby with her. \n\nNo. Just because you have a kid doesn\u2019t mean you can dump it on someone when you want a break. You know before hand that the kid is your responsibility and nobody else\u2019s", "NTA. She lied to you about only being gone for an hour and then went ahead and screwed you over. You did the right thing.", "NTA.\n\nHonestly; I wouldn\u2019t even have offered to \u201ckeep an eye\u201d on the baby. I don\u2019t like babies or kids in general so in my opinion you were generous. But, unfortunately some people who are offered an inch take a mile.", "NTA. She said she would be back soon and lied. NEVER agree to be left alone with the baby again.", "NTA your sister never intended to be back in an hour. She planned to be gone for hours. She lied to you.", "ESH\n\nYour sister sucks for leaving her kid with someone unqualified to care for them. Your sister sucks for coercing you into taking the kiddo for an hour then changing it to several hours. \n\nYou suck for threatening to call the police vs talking to your sister more sternly or calling your mom.", "ESH. Your sister sucks for bait and switching her, you suck for trying to use the police for a personal gain. This is not what police are for, this is not neglect.", "NTA.\n\nYou agreed to watch your sister's baby for one hour, with the caveat that you don't know how to provide car beyond watching the child in their car seat.\n\nShe reneged on her arrangement with you and left you alone much longer than expected.\n\nAnd her solution to learn how to care for a baby is a screeching joke. Yes, you could learn now to care for a baby, but you don't you do this by having an infant thrust into your arms and being told to take care of the baby. If she wanted you to care for the baby longer (and if you agreed) she should have shown you how to do the other things associated with caring for her baby.\n\nI wouldn't agree to care for her baby again. I think what she did was absolutely despicable. She agreed for one hour, disappears for two, then calls you and says she'll be gone for three more hours to get her nails done.", "NTA You schedule a babysitter BEFORE you leave to go get your nails done, not AFTER!", "NTA. So your sister preferred to do her nails rather than take care of her baby who needed help?  Wow....", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have pulled that shit when she knew damn well she had a nail appointment. Threatening to get law enforcement involved because you\u2019re somehow this incapable of watching a baby for a couple hours is super fucking scummy though.", "Ah yes a classic case of \"im gonna het creampied but i fullfill my duties as a parent\"\nGo NC. \n\n\nNTA \n\nOh and yes report her for neglect", "NTA. Your sister had every intention of leaving you with the kid for longer than agreed & lied to you. One doesn't just drop in for a 3 hour nail session, she had an appointment.", "NTA, There's some things in life I that I think can be learned by trial and error, or a quick internet search.\n\nTaking care of a baby is definitely not one of those things.  You'd need to be shown how to do things before being responsible for a baby.", "Nta & because no one else has said it DO NOT LEAVE A BABY TO SLEEP IN A CAR SEAT (not yelling lol just want people to notice). It is unsafe for a baby to be in a carseat outside of the car but even more so if for long periods of time. I know it wasn\u2019t your fault as you didn\u2019t know but please next time you are responsible for any child do not leave them in the car seat", "NTA. That is your sister\u2019s responsibility. You took care of the baby while she went out fir groceries- good. That\u2019s a good way to help sis out. She\u2019s out for a spa day??? No, she can pay for a sitter or leave baby with someone who is willing to take care him. Not just dump him with you after you explicitly told her.", "I mean you are nta here your sister shouldn't try to take advantage and you are in the right to be upset etc. but changing a baby is not rocket science and formula has all instructions on the tin.", "NTA - I feel you here a lot. I am super easily overwhelmed when it comes to babys and kids and thats why I dont babysitt my niece. I am happy to watch her if my sister is in the house with e if she wants to shower or do some cleaning or cooking. But please never ever leave me alone with a baby for the sake of both of us.  \nYou made crystal clear what you can and cant do and she was not respecting your boundaries.", "NTA.  If she were a decent mom, she would bring him over and show/ supervise you  in how to care for him.  Not drop him off with nothing.  She had time to do classes and learn, you did not.  And...she would also honor the time she said she would be back.", "NTA. You agreed to watch your nephew for one hour while your sister got groceries and she ended up trying to take five hours. You told her you were unequipped to take care of a baby's needs and still she tried to leave her child with an inexperienced sitter for that amount of time.", "NTA. You agreed to one hour and let her know that you didn\u2019t know how to take care of the baby beyond just watching it. She tried to take advantage of you and leave you with it for hours. Did she think the baby was going to lay there peacefully for that long? lmfao", "NTA- you made an agreement for an hour she then tried to lie, pressure, and bully you into having 5 hours of free childcare while she got a break. I am a parent. I get it you need breaks and to still take care of yourself this isn\u2019t how you go about it. She shouldn\u2019t just be showing up expecting everyone to be available at her disposal - that\u2019s entitled and off putting behavior on her part that leads to issues. If she wants you AND you also want to be an option for childcare there should be times where you spend time with them so you can learn to change diapers, outfits, his schedule, how to feed, and play with him so you and him are set up for success. But even then she needs to follow through and only be gone for the pre-agreed upon time frame. My guess something else is going on and she is struggling and thought she could go running to your mom to fix it and she wasn\u2019t able to. She then tried to use you to fix it and it didn\u2019t work. She then lashed it because hurt people- hurt people. She also might be upset that you aren\u2019t as involved or family isn\u2019t as involved as she imagined. You need to talk to her once everyone is calm", "NTA One hour turned to two and she tried to make it five. She\u2019s an AH for just coming over to dump the baby on y\u2019all\u2019s mom in the first place. If she can afford nails, she can pay for a babysitter.", "NTA You gave her and inch and she took 5 miles. It's inexcusable on her part. I would refuse to watch him again.", "**NTA**!!\n\nYour sister tried to take advantage of you by deceiving you on how long she would be and she put her baby at risk, just to get her nails done. \n\nYou did the right thing by threatening to call the police.", "NTA.\n\nYour sister took advantage of you. Babies aren't toys to be left behind when you want to get your nails done. \n\nAnd nobody teaches you how to be a parent. These things take time. Some people learn quicker than others and very few are just natural. \n\nDon't feel.guilty,  OP, your sister shouldn't have taken advantage of you or lied as to what her plans were. \n\nMaybe there'll come a time when you don't mind changing a nappy or two, if your sister shows you how.", "NTA- you were nice to watch the baby for her for an hour, her expecting you to watch them for longer is an AH move especially when you made it clear you didn\u2019t know what you were doing and we\u2019re not comfortable providing care. What kind of mother leaves their baby with someone who doesn\u2019t know how to take care of it?!", "Nta. Your sister is a major asshole. And just so you know (I know it\u2019s not your baby and don\u2019t expect you to know but your sister sure as hell should) but keeping a kid in a car seat when they\u2019re not in the car is extremely dangerous. You should have your sister look up positional asphyxiation.", "NTA, she lied to you and took advantage. I would never leave my child with someone who didn\u2019t know how to care for babies. Even if you knew what you were doing it would still be NTA. You can\u2019t just toss your kid on someone who has no interest in watching them.", "NTA\n\nYou agreed for 1 hour. And you had stipulations of you are literally only watching the child, not doing anything extra.\n\nShe knew her deadline, missed it, then expected you to care for the child (which you never agreed to) for 3 more hours jus so she can have fun and get her nails done (what nail salon takes 3 hours?!). Self care is important, but she knowingly went against your agreement and your stated boundaries to try to do it. Not the time. She can do that when she has found someone to care for the child while she's away.\n\nShe's the asshole, and while threatening the police is extreme, you got the point across and she came back to take the kid. Hopefully she makes better childcare decisions in the future.", "NTA for being upset sister changed plans on you and took longer BUT definitely TA for threatening to call the police for neglect which would then involve cps. Wtf is wrong with you! For starters, since you agreed to watch the baby, you would have been the one charged if it came to that. Brilliant move there Sherlock. Next, you apparently are a sh!t sister to even contemplate such a thing. I rarely say anyone should go NC with family but this just may well be one of those few cases where she just gives you the middle finger and puts you out of her life.", "NTA -- Your sister sounds incredibly entitled, even if you h had the skills to look after a baby bumping a 1 hour visit up to 5 hours is just an awful move. \n\nJ just a double check something though is your sister always doing favors for you that might color things slightly if she bends over backwards for you all the time and this is the one time she has something in return maybe she would have an expectation you would try to help, but somehow I doubt this. The fact that she didn't even check if your mom was available before coming over to hand off her child reeks of selfishness.", "NTA. You set expectations and so did your sister. One hour, \"I don't know what I'm doing, and \"I don't feel comfortable doing anything but literally watching the baby\" were all things SHE agreed to. She broke the agreement by extending herself by three hours for something unnecessary, which she has to know meant you would obviously have to do some care for her child, when she already knew you were uncomfortable/didn't know what to do, because you told her exactly that. \n\nI don't fully understand other people telling you to \"google it\", as though that's enough to learn how to fully care for an infant that isn't yours, and although I think it was maybe a bit harsh to threaten calling the police for neglect (unless she has a history of doing this), if your sister wants someone to take care of her baby, she should hire someone. I would hate to see you become the default babysitter as your sister continues to navigate motherhood because you didn't establish these boundaries when the opportunity was there. \n\nNeeding groceries is one thing, but tacking on another three hours to get your nails done is another (if she can afford a three hour nail appointment, she can afford a sitter). One is necessary and the other is optional, if she wanted to get her nails done she should have been honest about that in the beginning, or at least called to ask if that's ok.\n\nYou did your sister a favour and she took advantage.\nAgain, because I hate that you feel bad for being tricked into almost a full day of child care, NTA.\n\nEdited for clarity.", "Nta \nUr sister was gone for 2 hours and wanted u to watch the baby for 3 more if I'm being honest u did the best thing you could do at that moment you made it clear to your sis what u would and would not do for the kid", "ESH. Your sister for obvious reasons.\n\nYou're 18 and can't figure out what to do in this situation besides \"call the police\"? How about call your mom, call a friend? Have you never seen a movie that had a baby in it? \n\nI never held a baby until I had my own.  I could still have managed to deal with one if necessary.", "NTA\n\nYou 100% did the right thing and I'm actually amazed (in positive sense) of how you handled the situation", "NTA. I was wondering why she needed to leave her baby with you if she was just going grocery shopping. I took my kids everywhere with me when they were babies because I had no sitters. It made a whole lot more sense when you said she was getting her nails done. She already had that planned but because your mom wasn\u2019t home, she didn\u2019t want to tell you the truth so that you\u2019d have no choice but to watch her baby. She totally took advantage of you in this particular situation.", "NTA. You told her your stipulations for watching the baby. She was trying to take advantage of you by pushing how long she was out. \n\nAnd why the heck does it take 3 hours to get her nails done!?!", "You and sister agreed to 1hr. Any point past that 1hr where sister is not actively on her way back you could consider abandonment (and neglect since you're not qualified and she knows it) and call the cops or CYS/CPS, whatever service it is where you are. \n\n5 hours is excessive, baby could have died. \n\nOne school I work at will call for parents with a pattern of being 1hr late to picking up their kids. You are not a school and can call for less.", "NTA.  She said an hour.  You agreed to an hour.  If she was a decent mom, she would have taken the time to show you the things that you need instead of just dumping her baby on you.  You are not a bad aunt.  She\u2019s a bad mother.", "I swear I have seen this posted before. Right down to sister being at a nail appointment\u2026", "NTA\n\nShe was extremely irresponsible. Kudos to you for being willing to chip in at all and try and be a kind and helpful sibling.", "NTA. My sister used to pull this crap on me when we lived together and she just had her oldest daughter. She\u2019d ask me to watch her for 20 minutes while she went to pick up her baby daddy, then be gone for 2-3 hours. While I was capable of taking care of my niece, it was the principle of the matter. When she\u2019d get home, she would say, \u201cOh, we went to go eat,\u201d or \u201cOh, we went to the gym.\u201d Uh, that\u2019s not what you said you were going to do, you said you\u2019d go pick him up and be right back. Now she\u2019s aware she can\u2019t pull that crap anymore", "Your sister had the baby, your sister is responsible for the baby and EVERYTHING that goes with it. She is full of shit, she knew from the start what she wanted to do and how long it would take, she lied thinking you would just deal with her responsibility. The way she treated you would guarantee I never help her out again. Lazy? Decent Aunt? Fuck that mess. Good news is now you know she\u2019s a liar and conman and can tell her to go pound sand next time she needs a favor NTA", "NTA. You and your sister should know you can not leave a baby for extended periods of time in a car seat. Especially if they are asleep, They can die like that.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t decide to have kids, your sister did. It\u2019s up to her to find competent and willing care. Which may cost more than getting her nails done.", "Yes, you are the asshole for threatening to call the police, instead of looking up a youtube tutorial on how to calm a child.

She didn't tell you anything about how to care for her son - she just left. And then while she was out, and her son was in the \"care\" of someone who wasn't even slightly suitable to care for him, she decided to stay out for three more hours.", "I didn\u2019t know getting your nails done was a part of grocery shopping. NTA!! it\u2019s her fault for not getting a qualified babysitter. You legit told her that you were 100% incapable of caring for a child. It\u2019s not your fault that she chose to ignore that.", "Nta, taking care of kids when you never had to is TERRIFYING and I\u2019m answering that as someone who loves and cares for kids daily! Your sister is irresponsible for not only leaving her infant son without properly showing you basic care (how to change a diaper and formula ratios, but also how to properly hold a child with no head control) but also trying to lengthen her time away from the baby without telling you! She legally abandoned her child because not only did she (planned to) go WAY past the original one hour, but there was no calls or information given to you about it! You had to call HER and THEN she said she was gonna get her nails done!?!", "I honestly doubt the plans were new. She probably just lied to get op to agree to caring for the baby. NTA", "She told her sister she had no idea what to do, talking sternly isn't helping here.", "Have you ever had a sibling who 6 years older than you when you're 18? Why am I even phrasing that is a question? You obviously are used to being listened to, so you obviously don't.", "kind of is\u2026leaving a 3 month old baby with someone who you know isn\u2019t equipped to take care of them? that\u2019s poor parenting and neglect the way I see it.", "Leaving your child with someone who doesn't know how to care for them and doesn't want to care for them is neglectful. Anything can happen. What then? She put her child at risk just by leaving them with a person who can't handle basic tasks like feeding them, changing a diaper, etc. Anything can happen. What if the child had something serious occur in that hour? The mother should be there for her child and if she needs to have childcare, find appropriate childcare.\n\nEven for an hour, that's dangerous. Making it 2, then trying to add an additional 3 hours (and I'm sure there would've been something else after this 3 hour \"nail\" adventure) is horribly dangerous and neglectful to her child. \n\nI wouldn't let my dog or cat stay with someone if they stated they didn't know how to care for them. And she left a defenseless human child. This is something the police are for--as the police often are the only option for things they really shouldn't have to do. You call the police for mental-health check ins. The police are also the people to call for neglected and/or abandoned children.", "\"Use the police for a personal gain\"\n\nCan you please elaborate on how calling the police on their sister would in any way be a personal gain for OP? OP said they'd call the police for *neglect*, which is pretty much exactly what someone is doing when they abandon their three month old infant with their 18 year old sibling for an undetermined amount of time. \n\nHow would this equate to a win for OP?", "Its absolutly neglect and i garantue you she's gonna do that on a daily basis lol", "So, if someone dumps their baby on you, you absolutely need to watch it instead of calling law enforcement to report child abandonment? \n\nI can tell you\u2019re a pushover", "Even being shown those things is wayyyy different than actually performing these tasks. Went to birthing class, breastfeeding and care class, read advice blogs and surprise, no one prepared me for a newborn rolling to his side while pee arcing into the air while I try to get the diaper situated.\n\nDefinitely NTA.", "Hey, not everyone is comfortable with changing. I mean I want kids in the future but I can\u2019t imagine having to change one, which would take some getting used to. It\u2019s not like picking up after dogs either, if you screw it up it could give the kid a rash or he could be uncomfortable and I don\u2019t think OP would want that responsibility.", "Exactly! She took advantage of OP reluctantly agreed to watch the baby. And people calling OP TA for threatening to call police and CPS, that's just a threat since talking to her didn't work, and look how fast she got back home from that. Good job OP lol.", "Way harsh. She's an overwhelmed teenager who panicked. And no, she wouldn't have been the one charged. Threatening police was too much but she didn't actually do it. Sister was clearly irresponsible.  At the least she could have spent 30 minutes showing her how to do things. I would NEVER leave my baby without knowing he'd be properly cared for.  ETA NTA", "But it is neglect. A sibling should know the level of baby knowledge their sibling has. Even when it\u2019s not explicitely mentioned multiple times. And yet mom just saunters off 4 times longer than initially agreed? And she can\u2019t even be bothered to prep a bottle? Any parent knows that after 4 hours that child is ravenous. \nNeglect - pure and simple.", "Wtf is wrong with you ?", "Threatening to call them to get her point across isn\u2019t fiscally calling them, why would she be charged for it she only agreed to babysit for an hour not 5 hours the parent would be the only one charged for neglect since op still there with the nephew that part you make no sense", "Nope, my sister and I don\u2019t have much of a relationship because of the age difference. We basically just lived together", "She shouldn\u2019t have to call her mom or her friends. She called her sister the person who is actually responsible for the baby. \n\nMovies with babies in them are not tutorials\u2026", "She told the sister no the sister was the entitled brat to still leave the child and lie about the length of time. SHE IS NOT ENTITLED TO FREE CHILD CARE.", "She is entitled lazy because she doesn't want to learn to take care of SOMEONE ELSES child.? Relative or not. It is not her kid. And this is coming from a mom of 3 under 4....I would never expect or call someone lazy because they didn't want to take care of a kid or kids that are not theirs. That's what's entitled, expecting someone to take care of your kids. You aren't entitled to a babysitter even from family. \n\nConsidering she agreed to it so sister could food shop and then sister tried to take advantage to go get her nails done. Like sorry, pay a babysitter. Sister is entitled.", "Are you dumb? The sister was neglecting her child, leaving it for an hour is fine. That\u2019s what op agreed too. But Five hours was not agreed on! 2 hours wasn\u2019t even. The sister would have deserved to have the police called. NTA op.", "What the hell is wrong with you. Its NOT her child! She has absolutely NO obligation to care for it.", "The only entitled person is the OP sister. The OP is NTA", "Not a parent huh? \nNever leave your child with someone who doesn\u2019t know what they are doing.\nYou tube is not the answer to everything\u2026", "So the \u201clazy entitled\u201d person here is the teen who agreed to watch an infant for one hour, fully admitting they didn\u2019t know how to do *anything* to care for the kid\u2026 and not the mother who lied and tried abandon her kid for 5 hours so she could go get her nails done?", "The entitled brat asked for one hour under certain conditions than tried to take 5 and ignored the agreement altogether.", "Good luck being downvoted into oblivion \ud83d\ude06", "Shut up. People with little experience of babies don't want to be left with one for HOURS \n\nIts incredibly entitled of OPs sister to expect OP to just look after and deal with the baby knowing OP has little experience with them and then just running off to go get her nails and stuff done.\n\nIf the sister had any common sense she'd have got a babysitter in advance or found someone else she knew that had more baby experience to tend to the baby if she wanted to be away for a few hours. Its not on OP to learn how to deal with a baby from YouTube videos whilst looking after them its on the baby's mother to make sure her baby is in capable hands.\n\nOP is NTA!!", "To reiterate, Both are assholes, the sister for leaving the kid with you, and you for calling the police instead of learning how to take care of the crying child in front of you and reprimanding your sister after with the stipulation of never watching her kid again.", "THIS RIGHT HERE. Sis behavior is shocking. Wanting to leave the baby for 5 hours with OP, who has no experience? And what about milk? I thought babies that young need to be fed every couple of hours or so and the poor baby was already screaming. NTA at all.", "*surprised pikachu face* hOw DaRe YoU?", "He was asleep when she came in, that\u2019s why I said I\u2019d watch him, cause he was asleep and didn\u2019t need holding. Before you ask, I do know how to hold a baby\u2026I\u2019m not that incompetent.", "Plus getting your nails done requires an appointement, so it was totally planned and she didn't botter checking in advance if anyone was available to babysit.", "Ypu take on that responsibility when you agree to watch a baby for aby amount of time. Rashes don't happen from changing baby, they happen from not changing baby", "Now you not in the future to just say no. And you have good reason to fall back on by including that he last time you agreed to watch him, sister said one hour and then tried to extend it to 5 hours so she could get her nails done.", "While it's very possible that the sister did have an appointment, I just want to point out that, no getting your nails done does not always require an appointment. The really good places usually do but there are plenty of nail salons (at least in my area) that allow walk ins"]}
