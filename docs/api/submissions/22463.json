I paused the talk with my parents to talk to my Husband and while doing so, switched to English because it's my Husband's native language, and didn't want him to work with comprehending a language he is learning while we're going through tough times. I asked him how his day was, discussed dinner briefly, and then he went into our bedroom to change out of work clothes. It no less than 2 minutes, and I was back to my conversation with my parents in Spanish. For context, I moved to America when I was ten and spoke no English. The first person to talk to me at school is now my Husband, and why I speak English. My parents move back to Columbia and wanted me to so I could marry someone Columbian (my Husband is white), but I didn't because I was engaged to my Husband. They have been cruel to my Husband because he isn't Columbian or South America. When I came back my mother commented that this was the third time we failed to have a baby and blamed it on his genes. I told her she needed to stop because she was  insulting me. I told her he was stressed because of project at work (he's an aerospace engineer) he has to do while going through this. She continued to comment about his genetics (He's tall and muscular, so I do not know why she say genetic) and I told her she needed to shut up because she was being a ignorant bitch for blaming his genes and hung up. She texted me hour later and told me I needed to apologize, and I like my reaction might have been too much.

How we phrase things when we are angry is important...  \n\nBut yeah - she doesn't like your hubby and when something goes wrong, she automatically blames him.    This is what a \"toxic\" situation looks like, and it is probably good that you guys are separated by such distance.

Your parents need to understand that you have the ability to cut them off from any future grandkids if they don't change their tune about your husband, as you both don't need to tolerate this level of disrespect from them.   \n\nThey are acting like spoiled kids throwing a tantrum because you didn't follow their specific desires to move back and marry a local, rather than act like mature adults and build a healthy relationship with their adult daughter and her husband.\n\nSo you can apologize if you think it will help, but the bigger battle by far is their attitude regarding your situation, and your marriage.   \n\nIf it were me, I'd probably tell her she needs to apologize first, as she was being completely ridiculous.
