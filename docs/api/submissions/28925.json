I would say you are the asshole based on how you talk about your sister (nothing you mention about her is an actual description of actual bad behavior or intentions- it\u2019s all just your interpretation). However, I think it\u2019s worth thinking about the fact that the date of your father\u2019s death doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the same thing to her that it does to you. Maybe it makes her feel closer to him, or maybe she forgot altogether the date he died.", "NTA she's a self obsessed arse tbh as if getting married doesn't give you enough attention.", "Oof and thats fathers day weekend too.

I know several people who planned wedding in the last year and dates fill fast and you don\u2019t always get the toons or whatever on certain dates. It could be something like that. \n\nI get that you\u2019ll be sad that day, but you could easily visit his grace before and after and choose to celebrate with your living family members.

Maybe she is planning something around it. Maybe not. If she isn\u2019t doing something, maybe suggest she does.

I will update post", "Is she trying to replace the day? A different way of making it \"not exist\" but more in line with who she is?\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. I personally wouldn't be okay with this either, but for some people, grief (processed, unprocessed, and everything in between) makes things seem logical in ways others can't see.", "No, I wouldn't. That information was not there when I read the post.", "The original post wasn\u2019t there when you read it?

My dad died on Christmas morning, (somewhat expected since he had cancer, but unexpected since he was supposed to still have time left according to the dr he had seen the day before) so I totally get how you feel. Lol if only it was just an anniversary and not a damn holiday that people celebrate for a month. I really can\u2019t blame you for not wanting to exist that day, but I\u2019m also not fans of ultimatums so maybe just decline the offer and state the reason why, if she wants to change the date after that then that\u2019s her decision & not something you forced on her. You never know, this could be her own weird way of honouring him or feeling close to him. You never know.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your loss. The first anniversary of my dad's death *haunted* me. I absolutely don't blame you if you don't attend a wedding on it. \n\nEventually it will get easier. The first few years I always felt like I was reliving that day on the anniversary. Finally I decided that I needed to focus on celebrating him on his birthday and try to forget the anniversary. 12 years later, I'm okay on that day, but it still sucks.", "Is your mom In the picture and married to your dad when he passed?

Obviously you have to have some conversation to let her know you cannot be her made of honor. \n\nBut YWBTA if you present it as an \"ultimatum\", change the date or else. She gets to decide how to honor her father, just as you do.", "No. She sounds like a narcissist. I\u2019m curious why you agreed to be her MOH though.

Does she really want half the guests to perhaps feel a little bit sad and the talk will be about your dead dad and how it would've been nice if he was here to celebrate the wedding.... rather than just about how she looks and how great the wedding is.  \n\nHaving her wedding on this day will likely take the spotlight off her for at least half the people there... and maybe when the other half hear how  it's the anniversary of his death that it will be questioned as to whether the wedding is a memorial to dad rather than about her.", "NTA. That will be the saddest wedding in the family with the most depressing anniversaries.", "Nta. And this is coming from someone got married on my great grandfather's birthday. J would've never thought to do it on his death day. And he and I discussed it prior to his passing and it definitely was more then a year later. Closer to a decade. But goodness, your sister is beyond the pale of an asshole(or beyond the veil), your grief is still so fresh. How can she honestly expect anyone in your family(dad's side obviously but also anyone who also loved and knew him and is therefore grieving his loss) to enjoy her wedding on the day he died! Y'all are gunna b sad AF not happy and cheerful. I would not only skip the wedding but frankly her marriage. Her and new bil just would cease to exist to me.", "My sister once put herself in the hospital because my other sister and I had had recent hospital trips and got attention. She faked a seizure and got caught and ended up in the psych ward.

She could have chose any date, but she chose the day of my dads death and Father\u2019s Day weekend. she has to feel some sort of guilt since she never told us and we found out through her own Facebook post. Had I been approached along with my family, asking how we would feel about this date, the tune would shift completely.", "I agree. My dad died in Januaru of 2001. I don't know the exact date bc I don't celebrate it nor grieve \"extra\" on that day. Hell, my twin sister died in June. Same thing.
