I would say you are the asshole based on how you talk about your sister (nothing you mention about her is an actual description of actual bad behavior or intentions- it\u2019s all just your interpretation). However, I think it\u2019s worth thinking about the fact that the date of your father\u2019s death doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the same thing to her that it does to you.

It could be something like that. \n\nI get that you\u2019ll be sad that day, but you could easily visit his grace before and after and choose to celebrate with your living family members.
