I don't know how long Gina has had Lulu, but she is extremely poorly behaved and untrained, and it makes me severely doubt the authenticity of her being a service dog, not that it really matters.\n\nOur building has a very strict no pets policy so Lulu is the only animal in the apartment.\n\nIn the 2 months that Gina has lived here, her dog has caused all kinds of problems which I'm gonna put into a list:\n\n1. When Gina leaves and goes to work, Lulu barks for hours at a time non-stop, and Gina works night shifts. This has gotten us loads of complaints off our angry neighbors and me and my other roommates bear the brunt of it.\n\n2. Lulu has destroyed our furniture including the couch and dining room chairs. She has also destroyed the carpet in the living room. (Bye bye deposit).\n\n3. On five different occasions Lulu has peed or pooped on the floor in the communal area and Gina won't clean it up for hours until she's been prodded and asked over and over.\n\n4. At one point when I wasn't home, Gina let Lulu into my room and she chewed up my shoes and Gina refused to replace them, and said it was my fault for keeping them on the floor within a dog's reach. I asked her why she even let Lulu into my room and she said she had a few drinks, got confused and thought it was her room??\n\nMe and my other roommates have talked to Gina about these issues and she just acts like they're not a problem and we're just overreacting.\n\nI'm considering making a complaint to the landlord about this. Although I don't mind living with a dog, I think this is too much and it is unfair on the rest of us living here. I know service dogs are important and such but I don't think it's reasonable to expect your roommates to put up with an extremely badly behaved dog.\n\nI talked to my other two roommates, one of them agrees that we need to complain to the landlord but my other roommate thinks we should leave it, because it will just rock the boat and make Gina mad and she may make everything worse on purpose.\n\nEdit to add: so I'm not sure about the laws in the USA, but we live in the UK and here, tenants with service dogs can be evicted if their dog is causing property damage that the tenant can't/won't pay to fix, or being a \"nuisance\" to other tenants or neighbours, but the landlord does need evidence of it.\n\nI know I'm within my rights to complain to the landlord and stuff but I just wanna know if morally it would make me an asshole.", "created_utc": 1670163466, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcatdq/wibta_if_i_complained_to_the_landlord_about_my/", "score": 158, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Dogs that are used as service dogs are vetted for health and temperament and trained very precisely for their peoples needs. Many pups do not pass the training.

How is it that you got a roommate that you don't even know??? I've never heard of a landlord having control over who lives (when there's multiple tenants) in an apartment.

A tenant can be asked to remove an ill behaved service dog/ESA from the property or face eviction. It has to be very clearly documented that there is an issue because there could be a legal challenge from Gina. \n\nI\u2019d talk to the landlord that there are clear issues and begin documenting all the damage the dog has caused so the costs of repairs are aimed at the person responsible for them and not you or the other roommates.", "NTA.

Your landlord may be an exception. That doesn't mean they can do anything about the service dog.\n\nThere is no official authority that certifies a dog is or is not a service animal, and there are several organizations that will issue certificates claiming that whatever animal you like is a service animal. So claiming this dog (or any dog) isn't a service animal is going to be tough.\n\nThere is specific housing law regarding discrimination against service animals. The landlord can't refuse to rent to Gina because of her service dog, or kick Gina out because of her service dog, basically, there is nothing the landlord can do about the service dog without getting sued. \n\nIf the landlord is leasing rooms individually, your best bet is to move out and let this be the landlord's problem.

I know in my college, if someone moves in with a service dog or even emotional support animal and the roommates have an issue with it, the roommates have to relocate as forcing the person with the disability to relocate is illegal - even if the roommates have a phobia of dogs.\n\nEDIT: I am speaking on this from a legal perspective.

A service dog\u2019s early retirement is a significant loss to both the handler and the organization.*\n\n*Even without an attack, a phony service dog can distract a legitimate, task-trained service dog from his or her job. Fake service dogs can also create a bias against actual service dogs if they have an accident or incident in a grocery store or other business that allows only service dogs, says Brozman.*\n\n*\u201cI think a lot of people see fraudulent service dogs as not really hurting anyone,\u201d she says. \u201cThe reality is that people are actually getting hurt.

If OP & the others leave:\n\n* Dog will still bark for hours every time Gina leaves, maybe more if she's the only one living there.

If somebody has that issue getting so drunk they don't know which room is theirs is sketchy behavior too.  \n\nWhen you talk with your landlord - it's not so much a 'dog problem' - it's a Gina the individual human problem.

Gina has gone into your room and left the door open to her dog, she's refused to compensate for the damage etc. She is leaving her dog alone to bark for hours which is making the neighbors angry, and she has done nothing to indicate she cares about this.  You come home to find the dog has pooped & peed on numerous occasions. \n\nIf the neighbors are coming at you about the noise - let them know you agree with them and they should let the landlord know, and if they want to file a police report ... you're not going to talk them out of it.", "Report this please op.", "i agree, but if she is the type of person to try and pass off a \"service dog,\" she probably isn't the type that will leave easily.", "OP does not control Gina, OP only controls OP.
