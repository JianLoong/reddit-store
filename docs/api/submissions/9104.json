It sounds like sis made a pretty (American) standard wedding request for no smaller kids because kids under 5 are notorious for being disruptive which, by your own admission, is likely to happen with your daughter. I understand that you must feel incredibly defensive on your daughters behalf but your sister isn\u2019t discriminating against your child *who you admit is likely to have a meltdown during a very important event* she is trying to save everyone- INCLUDING your special needs daughter- from an incredibly uncomfortable afternoon. \n\nYTA- learn to accept boundaries graciously and teach the same to your kids. It\u2019s an essential skill in life.", "YTA. You\u2019re setting a bad precedent.", "Oh, boy.  The thing is, we get a lot a LOT of posts from adults here with ND siblings whose parents insisted the ND sibling HAD to be included in everything.  Going to a classmate's birthday party?  Then your nonverbal high needs autistic sibling has to go or you can't go, because the sibling has no friends and will never get to experience this otherwise.  Going to the movies with your friends?  Then the sibling has to come too, even though they will get overstimulated and start screaming and everyone will get thrown out.   Going for a walk in the park with a boyfriend?  The sibling has to go along.  \n\nWe all know how where this will end, in twenty to thirty years.  \"NT, we're getting older and we can't take of Sibling anymore.  You need to step up and take responsibility.  No?  What do you mean, no?  What do you mean, she ruined every event in your life?\"\n\nI think the OP means well, but they need some perspective.    Soft YTA, and talk to someone professional about navigating these murky waters before they come to my predicted conclusion.", "YTA. Age restrictions at a wedding are common. Please don\u2019t weaponize this completely normal request.", "Yeah, YTA.  Quite a lot really, as there are two distinct and severe fails here:\n\n1 -- You ain't teachin the 7yr old about 'it's not okay to exclude family'.  You are literally excluding her, a member of the family. Christ, the effort it must be taking you, to not see that.\n\n2 -- Punishing/limiting the NT child for the benefit of the NNT child is EXACTLY how you wind up looking after NNT child yourself while NT child calls once every few years, a few years down the road.  It's real bad parenting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you actually want to teach a message about family unity, then just don't go.  That would fix problem 1 and make you less of a hypocrite, but it would still leave problem 2.", "YTA. \"No under 5s\" is pretty reasonable imo, there's a good chance you're reading into it too much. Sounds like a compromise rather than fully child-free. Also, you're punishing your 7 year old daughter for your sister's choice, something your daughter has literally no say in, which is just weird.", "YTA. You are punishing one child to make the point you feel your other child was excluded. If you feel that strongly your entire family should stay home.", "N T A if you also stay home. *That* would be teaching your kids it's not okay to exclude family due to a disability.\n\nGoing yourself, while leaving them home is *not* teaching them this lesson nearly as effectively.\n\n> Since it is my sister I don't feel right missing her wedding so we are going without the girls and my in-laws will watch them that night. \n\nThis makes me say YTA tho. You aren't teaching her a lesson. You're sacrificing her wants to teach your sister a lesson, a lesson you're not willing to teach her yourself.", "YTA.  This isn\u2019t a teaching moment for your 7 year old, it\u2019s a punishment.  If you want to teach her that\u2019s it\u2019s wrong to exclude her sister, then you should all stay home.  What you are teaching her by going without her is that she will be punished for her sisters exclusion.  She will learn to resent and hate her sister.", "YTA for causing your 7yr old to miss out while the rule per your correction is \"no kids **5 and under** \". I understand you feel like the rule was made to slight your kid but Sometimes its not exactly about them. Maybe your sister probably really wanted a child-free wedding but knew she wouldn't have a alot attendees if she did that so she tried to find a compromise for her wedding.", "YTA In 15 years you will be posting asking how you could have made such a mistake restricting your NT child in a misguided effort to be fair to your autistic child. \n\nAnd wondering if she will be no contact for ever and what you should do.", "YTA. Your sister didn\u2019t create a situation, you did. You\u2019re creating resentment, not your sister. You\u2019re pushing your daughter for nothing. Three for three. You\u2019re the problem here. Not your sister", "YTA. You going to the wedding while leaving 7yo home with her sister to teach her not to exclude people with disabilities is a double standard. You shouldn't be going either. On top of this, you're potentially fostering ill feelings in your 7yo towards 5yo. Either you don't go as well, or just bring 7yo without 5yo.", "YTA.  Her rule is perfectly reasonable, and no 'we'd take her out if she had a melt down' is NOT an acceptable plan for a wedding in this circumstance.  The fact that you don't understand that tells me the happy couple has very, very good reason for excluding your daughter.     \n\n\nAlso, you're teaching your 7 year old that she will always come second fiddle to your favorite child, and that her wants and needs are unimportant.    You need to rearrange your thinking or she's not going to contact you as an adult.", "YTA. Yes, your child is ND, but your sister's rule is a common rule at weddings to ensure that everyone involved enjoys themselves. Unless you have seen your sister intentionally exclude your youngest daughter from other events before, then you're being an overly sensitive AH. If your sister has excluded your daughter before, then you're still the AH for keeping someone like that in your life and modeling that tolerance of intolerant behavior for your daughters. \n\nOn top of that, keeping both girls home makes it look like you just want to party kid-free at the event rather than teach a lesson about fairness and inclusion.", "YTA. This is a common rule. Take your 7 year old and enjoy the wedding. Don\u2019t be that person that makes someone else\u2019s wedding about themselves and feels like the rules should be changed for their child.", "INFO: How young are the other two under-5 children who are also being excluded?", "INFO: why does your older child has to suffer the consequences of your 5-year-old? Is this something that happens often?\n\nAnd how are you sure she is purposely excluding your child? You said there were two other children under 5 who couldn't go?", "YTA\n\nIf that is the lesson you want to teach your daughter (and your sister) then you shouldn't be going either. This is a double standard and you're choosing to exclude one daughter who is clearly looking forward to it while having a good time at the wedding yourself.\n\nGet yourselves dressed up with both kids and give them a good day if you feel that strongly about the rule.", "Soft YTA. I think it's fair to want something like a wedding to go how you envision it, and children are often excluded for this reason. It's unfortunately not up to you to make up the rules on this one. I don't think punishing your other daughter is the best course of action here though, as she would be the one suffering for your pettiness. Your youngest daughter doesn't seem like she would care to go, so I don't particularly think there is much harm done in this specific situation. It's not like she won't be welcome at family gatherings in the future (and if she isn't, *then* I would definitely make this a larger issue). This is your sister's wedding, not a time to make it about yourself.", "YTA. You are denying your older kid experiences she would enjoy because her sister wouldn\u2019t be able to go. Why are you only concerned with your younger daughter?", "YTA\n\n>My sister made a rule about her wedding no kids under 5, which I think was a \"polite\" way of excluding my disabled child.\n\nYour disabled child is 5 years old, so......no?\n\n>As my 6 year old nephew (also neurotypical) just \"made the cut\" and gets to go\n\nWhat's with the quotes around \"made the cut\"? He's 6, which is above the \"no kids under 5\" rule, so obviously he gets to go.\n\n>Since it is my sister I don't feel right missing her wedding so we are going without the girls and my in-laws will watch them that night.\n\nThis is your only saving grace here - that you're not skipping out on your sister's wedding, you're just choosing not to bring the kids.", "I think you're being sensitive but whatever. I wouldn't want a screaming child at my wedding but I also get why you don't want your kid to be excluded. At the end of the day, everyone is entitled to their choice NAH", "NAH Your sister isn't an asshole for wanting a quiet ceremony for her wedding.  You're not an asshole for wanting to include your daughter, but this isn't your party and you know what, not everyone can always go to everything. \n\n There are so many threads on here of the NT child being denied party's and playdates because they have a ND sibling who can't go. I see it at our school all the time.  Unless a party parent can accommodate 4 additional siblings 2 in wheelchairs then the invited child can't go.  I realise this is your own family but it sounds like they're usually supportive and loving, please don't ruin everyone's experience of this, especially your own daughter.", "A very soft YTA.   Your younger child will not be included in things your older one will.   And you are teaching your older one that rules apply to her, not you.   Children 5 and under might be unusual, but not rude.  Someone else you do not know may have a 4 year old not toilet trained.   There could be many issus.", ">She's upset she doesn't get to go, and my sister says I'm fostering resentment but I think Im teaching my daughter it's not okay to exclude family due to a disability. \n\nI don't think that lesson is going to land the way you think it will. And I actually do think it will breed resentment. The problem with it is that you are still going to the wedding. You aren't teaching your seven year old that it's wrong to exclude her sister because of her disabilities, so much as you're teaching her that exclusion will be forced upon her too. If you want her to learn that exclusion isn't okay, you have to miss the wedding too. If you want her to learn that she'll be punished when things are unfair to her sister, keep doing what you're doing.\n\nSo for this I'm gonna say YTA unless you decide to also not go.", "YTA. What else will you require your daughter -- but not you! you don't have to miss something you would really like to do! -- to miss out on because her sister can't handle it?\n\nIf you want to say \"entire family or nothing\", whatever. But you are saying your daughter has to lose out for her sister (who, it seems, would not even want to go to the wedding), but not you.", "YTA- regardless of reason, you chose not to bring your daughter and then used your other daughter as an excuse and blamed it on your sister.\n\nInstead of just communicating with everyone, including your children, you blamed your sister. You are the parent and how you chose to treat your own children is squarely on your shoulders, no one else\u2019s.  Does your other daughter even want to go to the wedding?  Does she even care?\n\nAs someone who has a disabled sibling, I was always left out because it was \u201ceveryone or no one\u201d sort of situation and it just made me resent that sibling and those adults because no one even asked for our personal opinion. Don\u2019t fall into this trap. There will be plenty of times where one siblings wants to do something and the other doesn\u2019t or it\u2019s not appropriate for both.", "YTA.\n\nYou are making an awful lot of assumptions. NT or not, kids under 5 are often unpredictable.  I myself have seen 2-3 year olds running around at family gatherings screaming, throwing things and their parents were just sitting on their phones. Totally reasonable rule. \n\n(That said, i hope she would make an exception for an infant). \n\nI feel like you are being a bit overly sensitive and i can understand wanting to protect your 5 year old but it may not even be about her being ND.", "YTA - the only person being punished here is your 7 year old. If you really cared about making a point about your youngest not being invited then you wouldn't go yourself. Not inviting under 5s is a common enough rule, there has to be a cutoff somewhere. There will be rides that your older daughter can go on because she will be over a certain height. Eventually your older daughter will be old enough to drink, vote, drive, have sex and the younger won't. Not allowing her not to do things because her sister can't will definitely foster resentment.", "YTA. If you're mad at your sister, punish your sister. Your 7 year old is basically getting a consequence/punishment when she did nothing wrong. I understand you think you're teaching her about inclusion, but if you're going to the wedding you're not teaching her that lesson at all. She's the only one, by how you have explained it, who was explicitly invited but is not going to attend. I don't see why you're handling it this way - either skip out on the wedding yourself or let your daughter go.", "INFO: have you had this conversation with your sister? Is there any possibility that this is a very misguided way of being \u201chelpful\u201d, so that now you don\u2019t have to decide whether you should bring your younger child?\n\nIt\u2019s tough to say without knowing what her motivation is. If it\u2019s because she thinks she\u2019s making it easier for you, then at least it is coming from a good place. You can tell her what you said here - you and your spouse have an action plan in case your younger one needs a break. \n\nIf it is because she\u2019s worried about disruptions in her wedding, I get why you would be defensive. On the other hand, has there been any experiences lately at other events that could cause concern? And I say lately because you can\u2019t compare any kid at 5yo to their younger self and expect the same behavior. \n\nOr maybe she just really hates those twins and at least one other kid had to take one for the team so it wouldn\u2019t be so obvious. /s\n\nMaybe there is a compromise to be had as well. Bring the 7yo to the ceremony only so she can get her fill of princess stuff. Have your spouse spend that time with your 5yo doing something she loves to do during some special one-on-one time.

It's either all 4 of you go or none of you.", "YTA. Why are you hellbent on taking the younger daughter somewhere she will be miserable?

Children at weddings is commonly a debated topic.  Will other five and unders be there?  If not, it's fair.  It's not uncommon at all for couples to have a child free wedding, or to only welcome older children. The fact that you stated a contingency plan, already suggests you should self reflect as to whether it's appropriate to bring your younger daughter, regardless of age restrictions.\n\nYour daughter, by your own account, vehemently wants to go.  There is absolutely no reason for her not to, when you and your wife are attending.\n\nPeople who have already said this are right.  There are posts here regularly from adults dealing with being sidelined or prohibited from regular activities they want because their parents are trying to make things fair.  \n\nIt's not fair.  It's not fair to your younger daughter she isn't going to get the experience your older can.  It's not fair to your older to daughter to limit her experiences for someone else, regardless of who they are.\n\nIs your younger daughter actually going to mourn missing the wedding?  Because your seven year old will, and hold in the back of her mind into adulthood.", "Your children are different people. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean you love one less than the other.

People came all the way from Jamaica to Brooklyn for this wedding, they might have liked to hear at least a little of the ceremony - no such luck.   The kid wrecked dinner at  one table because he was very grabby, taking food off of other people's plates.

If you want them to bond over activities, try something not so loud! Arts and crafts, gardening, etc. Traumatizing your 5 y/o with loud events is just going to hurt her progress. ABA therapy is notoriously traumatic and abusive to ND kids\u2014 you\u2019re actually repeating one of its techniques by bringing your daughter repeatedly into stressful situations. \n\nThere are plenty of successful, independent autistic young adults who were nonverbal or high maintenance at her age. You seem more focused on making your family appear normal than with actual supporting her needs for growth.", "It seems all kids 5 or younger are not allowed to the wedding though.

I could not imagine being so upset about one kid that you would not just stay home with her husband and daughters.", "Because that way if anyone asks why 7yo is not there, OP gets to soapbox and make a big deal about 5yo.

The world does not centre around you and I seriously doubt this rule was solely against your youngest. \n\nAdditionally, your youngest would likely find the whole ordeal to be a miserable experience with the noise level of the reception etc. \n\nYou are not doing your oldest any favours by teaching her that she will miss out on opportunities in life because of her sister. She is too young to have that level of understanding and empathy. Rather, she will be building frustration and resentment towards disabilities instead of the real intent of the bride: to be included/excluded by AGE. \n\nStop being so overly sensitive and defensive to the detriment of your oldest. \n\nYou hopefully realise that many siblings of disabled people live unfair lives due to your parenting methods. You cannot help but favour and protect your children, but this is NOT something she HAS to miss, nor should it be. There will be so many countless situations where the exclusion is very real, or where concessions will be made in the name of inclusion, that you should be finding the opportunities for your oldest to get to participate in things that will otherwise not matter to or upset the youngest! \n\nI am so frustrated on behalf of your oldest.", "I don\u2019t see it as excluding the daughter when the daughter probably has no interest in going in the first place.\n\nWeddings are not fun events even for neurotypical children.

It\u2019s time to learn that siblings are allowed to attend different events and have an identity outside of \u201cx\u2019s sister\u201d. Congrats on cementing the hate your daughter will have towards her sibling! \n\nIt\u2019s 2023, how tf are parents still ignorant to the damage they\u2019re doing?", "I dunno. Not sure OP will ever realize the mistake.", "When I was 14 I went to a family wedding and was the oldest \u201cchild\u201d there. \n\nThere was one little cousin (no issues or disabilities, just a brat) who threw fits and because me and my other cousins were at the kids table we (mostly me) had to deal with it. \n\nAdults were drinking and having fun, kid was SCREAMING and kicking us and all sorts, we were trying to get things under control (away from the bride and groom to not disturb them) while being ignored, and a staff member at the venue comes in and starts having a go at me for causing a disturbance and saying I needed to be quiet (she can see the brat right there, screaming) and that I\u2019m disrespectful etc etc. \n\nTo be clear: me, 14 left in charge of child care. Adults, drinking and ignoring the situation. Child (around 5-ish) screaming and kicking me. Adult working at the venue, telling *me* to be quiet. \n\nSo yeah\u2026 sometimes there\u2019s a really good reason to not have kids under a certain age.", "Agreed. 5/6 is generally when kids go to school (depending on if they live in a state where kindergarten is mandatory). School is where kids learn to sit quietly, take turns, wait in lines, and a lot of other societal norms that would be handy to attend a wedding. That makes that age a very natural dividing line for attending a formal social event.", "Also there are two other kids on the family that are under 5, so the rule doesn't affect only the kid with special needs.", "Even if both children were invited a wedding (or any big event) is no place for a high needs nonverbal autistic child. It would be a disservice to the 5 year old to put her in that situation. You should definitely remove a child from a situation when they are having a meltdown but more importantly you should try to avoid those triggers to benefit the child.\n\nI feel bad for the 7 year old. This seems like the beginning of a trend of not allowing her to do things because her younger sister won't be able to experience them.", "This. Equity not equality. For a child who has a developmental disability like autism it can be extremely jarring to go from being around a small group of people at most to a gathering with a lot of people and loud music and lights and extremely structured events where the child is required to sit still or be quiet. Personally I wouldn't want to put my autistic child (if I had one) in any environment that could put them at risk for any emotional or physical stress. Depending on the kid and the meltdowns that child has this would be a horrible idea. Autism presents differently depending on gender and severity so I can't speak exactly to this child's situation. It seems like the parents are fully aware this is an issue for their child and still want to subject their child to something that could cause issues for that child.\n\n YTA, leave the youngest to get special time with in laws and spoiled, and take your oldest. They both get what they need and they both get some special bonding time.  It is incredibly important to have special bonding time like that with your child who doesn't have these kind of issues. Letting them have a break from their sibling with the focus of their parents is incredibly important and valuable", "> there's only two other children under 5 in the family no known disabilities yet\n\nAlso the assumption that none of her sister's friends have kids under 5 who aren't invited? It's a wedding rule not a thinly veiled insult", "Dear OP, \n\nWhat a perfect opportunity to introduce your 7 year old to the next 11 years of missed opportunities, lost friends, isolation and growing resentment towards her younger sister and parents. I say this because you know you won\u2019t stop here. \n\nAnd it will only be 11 years because she\u2019ll go NC as soon as she can get away from you. Keep reading these comments here from the siblings of other ND children. \n\nListen, I fully understand your need, not desire, but your **need** to protect and defend your youngest. But you can\u2019t do so at the expense of your other children. \n\n**You** are the parent, you are fully responsible for the care and protection of all of your children.

She's excluding her eldest daughter because her youngest isn't allowed, but she's still going. And she says it's to teach her eldest 7 year old daughter about how exclusion sucks. Feels kind of like she's already training her to always be the crutch for her sister. No parties unless sissy is invited. No going out unless sissy comes. This is the start of resentment breeding. And if she was really mad, she wouldn't go at all. That would drive the point home more than punishing her child that desperately wants to go.", "i am an autistic adult and i HATE weddings. if i could miss every single one it would be great. weird that she doesnt seem to consider that her daughter might not even have a good time there", "Absolutely.

Wedding ceremonies are generally pretty short these days so even the beginning of a meltdown will probably spoil the mood for the entire 15-30 minute ceremony. Plus, as I alluded to earlier, parents of autistic children are generally more accustomed to their disruptions so what OP considers worth removing her child far is probably above what will actually be disruptive because she seems pretty hell bent on \"including\" her child without really thinking through what that will mean for the couple, guests, and the child themselves. It's a big equality vs. equity question imo.", "She will learn that eventually. Might even know it now if this is typical of her parents behavior.  OP is still a major AH for denying her one of childhoods magic moments because her sibling is too young/disruptive to be included.", "Under 5 is perfectly reasonable.

I chose under 12 for mine because I didn't want younglings running around shrieking while they play at the reception.

I had to buy my own camera; my sister screamed that it wasn\u2019t fair and she wanted one too, so my mom bought one for her. \n\nIt was really irritating! I\u2019m really close to my sister as an adult and don\u2019t blame her at all for being such a spoilt brat as a child; she was just a kid being a kid. It was my mom\u2019s job to hold those boundaries and teach her not to always get her way, and too often (not always, but far too often) my mom just didn\u2019t do that.\n\nA really big part of that resentment and frustration is that my mom had no trouble at all telling **me** no about stuff. \u201cI don\u2019t care if everyone else has a TV in their room/a CD player/a stereo/a phone/a computer; you don\u2019t need one and I\u2019m not spending money on that.\u201d Or \u201cWe can talk about getting you one of those at X age, but you don\u2019t need it now.\u201d But when my sister kicked and screamed for it, suddenly the rules changed. \n\nSome stuff I never got at all - when I was in HS, I \u201cdidn\u2019t need\u201d and Mom couldn\u2019t afford clothes from Abercrombie and Hollister; I had to wear what we could find at Walmart, despite being bullied for years.

One of our kiddos (we are a blended family with more kids than sense lol) has autism. She is now able to articulate and advocate for herself, and most of the time, she chooses not to go to events like this because it is distressing to her. Having meltdowns is not something autistic children do for fun or because they are brats or whatever, it's because they are not (yet, perhaps, depending on the child) capable of articulating their distress. Honestly, even with NT kids this is an issue as well when they are little. They don't have the language to express \"hey, I'm really distressed and here is why and here is what I need\" so they meltdown instead.

Asking a 2yo to sit through 90 mins in a chair and hold still is above their pay grade. \nThat\u2019s not to say you shouldn\u2019t try, but not in a high stakes situation like a wedding. Your 7 yo is probably up to the wedding challenge and you should offer her that opportunity, but if the reception runs late and she\u2019s getting cranky, you pull her out at 8:30 or 9:00 and take her to bed.

My grandmother had to FORCE her to put a lock on the older ones room because the other two would go in there and go through her things and take the toys they wanted. It took the kid being old enough to voice some of that to change anything. And half the time I\u2019m sure if comes off as normal teenage groaning, but it\u2019s a pattern she instilled early on. And one to be very careful of. She\u2019s lucky that her kid tries to have pretty open communication. Most kids I know of at that age wouldn\u2019t have had the emotional maturity to tell her in a calm way how she was making her feel.

During the ceremony I had everyone in the wedding party sit down after the welcomes and in that 30 seconds my husband\u2019s cousin purposefully knocked over a sunflower and said \u201cI killed it\u201d in a nice loud and clear voice. It was hilarious and I absolutely did not care, but I can totally understand not wanting young kids at your wedding.", "Even them all not going wouldn\u2019t teach that it\u2019s not okay to exclude someone due to a disability. Because her disability wasn\u2019t why she was excluded. It was a rule for everyone.", "Same.  I\u2019m also NT, and having to spend an entire day 1) in uncomfortable clothes that you needed to keep clean, 2) being quiet, and 3) listen to \u201cboring adults being boring\u201d would be hell on earth to my 10-year-old-or-younger self.  \ud83d\ude02", "Yup.  My first thought was \"would the autistic 5 year old child even be able to tolerate a wedding?\"  It depends on the child of course, but it sounds like OP thinks there's a pretty good chance of meltdown.  Especially if she has to wear \"nice dressy\" clothes that may be itchy or uncomfortable, lots of unfamiliar people around, being expected to sit still and quietly, etc.  \n\nParents need to be realistic about what their kids are truly capable of handling.  It's good to gradually expose kids with autism to social situations, but weddings are kind of high-stakes for \"practice\" for a young neurodiverse child.  Better to bring them into social situations where it's less disruptive to retreat.", "Yep. If the kid is going to have a meltdown, you've put them in a situation where they are overwhelmed and can't deal with the sensory input. Also kids under 5 have a hard time sitting still and doing nothing during a boring wedding. I can think of nothing worse to do with a young child than force them into uncomfortable clothes to sit on a hard chair for an hour listening to boring old people talk.", "Also in this case the criteria for exclusion isn\u2019t even disability, it\u2019s age. So OP is lying to the older daughter.", "Yeah I am guessing it is more sibling rivalry stuff.", "My mom also would berate me for not being social enough.", "Agree, I\u2019m 20 with autism and the idea of attending a wedding is very unappealing to me. I\u2019ve had several cousins be married in the last 10ish years and I\u2019ve never attended a wedding because I know I\u2019ll be miserable and make other\u2019s And in turn myself uncomfortable.\nI don\u2019t have meltdowns as much as I have panic attacks which are different, but I still wouldn\u2019t put myself through that situation.", "He definitely isn't taking into consideration that the noise and lighting will cause her to be completely over stimulated which would cause her to have continuous meltdowns, even during the speeches because of how loud the microphone is.", "Totally agree!\nMy nephew suffer from autism and my sister did a lot of those choices when he was younger and it messed everything for everyone.\nOne time she insisted that he come with everyone to our car to wave us goodbye and he started a tantrum. My daughter was a baby and she started to get very distressed but my sister kept insisting. I was furious, for my baby\u2019s distress and the mess for everyone.\nShe also forced her daughter (older than my nephew) to let him play with every new toy she was getting and he usually damaged them within the 1st day. I felt so sorry for the poor girl. \nIn this case, the big sister wanted to go and it was probably no sacrifice for the young one as this type of events are full of triggers (and not a pleasure) for an autistic kid.\nOP should have taken the older girl to the wedding and done an activity dedicated to the younger one the following weekend. Everyone would have been happy.\nIt\u2019s not good to force kids this way.\nI can understand the guilt of them being treated differently but it will happen anyway: the older will have slumber parties, learn to drive, vote, etc. Before the younger one.", "It was the same way in my house! But she's almost 8 years younger than me and she's the golden child because my mom was in love with her narcissistic father and I ruined their marriage because of events that I had no control over and that should've never been allowed to occur. I was exposed to a lot of unfair treatment and abuse over the years because of it and even at 24, almost 25, years old my relationship with my mom hasn't fully recovered. Her treatment of me was already not right before my sister was born, it just got so much worse after. I don't even want to imagine what it would have been like if she was also ND to top everything off. My mom and I would probably be no contact instead of low contact smh.", "No compromises. He should respect the no guests under 5 rule. No exceptions. Especially since 2 other family members won\u2019t be able to go because of this rule. Could you imagine being the parents at the wedding who left their <5yos at home seeing OPs youngest daughter there? F that. He should definitely bring his eldest daughter tho.", "That sucks :(", "7 will hate her sister for this. Congratulations for exacerbating sibling rivalry, and showing 7 which kid you really love.", "Big sis needs to have special times", "Six year old nephew made the cut because he's six. Six is older than five. It goes four, FIVE, six. YTA.", ">My sister made a rule about her wedding no kids under 5, which I think was a \"polite\" way of excluding my disabled child.\n\n>there's only two other children under 5 in the family no known disabilities yet.\n\nINFO; So you think she's singling out your kid by also not inviting two other \"non-disabled kids\"?  You think she's playing the long game?  Do you also not let your 7 year old go to birthday parties and playdates if the 5 year old isn't invited?", "YTA. Even if this is a \u201cpolite way of excluding your child\u201d you need to get over it. This is THEIR day. They have every right to not want small children prone to tantrums there.\n\nMy son is autistic. I get it. \n\nWould this hurt my feelings? Yes. \nWould I do what you\u2019re doing? No.", "YTA and your daughter will grow to loathe you.  Prepare for that NC/LC", "YTA. Her rule probably was to eliminate the chance of an outburst at her wedding. It sucks to think your child is being excluded, I know how hard it is for your child to not get to do everything everyone else does. BUT let's be real, your child who is severely impacted by ASD most likely does not care that they weren't invited and would not enjoy going anyway. You were the one with hurt feelings. But if they were really hurt because your child was excluded then you wouldn't go. My child has ASD and if people can't accept her then I will cut them out of all of our lives without a second thought. But I also wouldn't bring my severely ASD child to a wedding. So at the end of the day if nobody in your family went to the wedding I would say N A H but the fact you are only offended enough to leave your daughter at home but not offended enough that you stay home makes YTA.", "Yes! I feel so bad for the older daughter. This guy is definitely TA. I have a sinking feeling this is the story of older sister's life.", "Besides, other parents might actually want to enjoy the ceremony and party without having to deal with their young kids.", "Yep this is an attempt to make his sister the villain and to cause drama on her wedding day!", "Yes. Weddings that say no children at all are lao very common in the US. No children under 5 sounds like a reasonable compromise that excludes the kids who are too young to understand what is going on or to manage their interruptions, but allows slightly older kids who can self regulate a bit more. \n\nIf it\u2019s someone else\u2019s expensive event I get a sitter for my young kids. Usually they have more fun playing games/going to park and watching movies with a sitter for an evening then they would at a stuffy adult event.", "In case no one has told you, not everything is about you or your nonverbal daughter. But I can guarantee you one thing you're older daughter is going to hate your guts if you don't stop. She's also going to learn to hate your other daughter because of it. Shame on you", "I get the feeling sister's disability has and will continue to exclude the other daughter for many years to come", "Yup. \n\n  \nAt my wedding nearly 30 yrs ago,  I wished I'd put in place a 'no children under 5 rule' - one child  howled all the way through my wedding vows and the parent didn't have the sense to take her through to the church hall.", "Well my grandson is an avoider. That guy knows what\u2019s what with his child.", "Which is why the bride and groom excluded ALL kids under 5!", "It's my least favorite, followed by \"White Knight\" Wednesday.", "Everything revolves around dad because he took the rule as a way to exclude his daughter. When it wasn\u2019t, it\u2019s just a general rule for everybody. His sister make up this rule with him in mind lol", "Yes. Weddings that say no children at all are also very common in the US. No children under 5 sounds like a reasonable compromise that excludes the kids who are too young to understand what is going on or to manage their interruptions, but allows slightly older kids who can self regulate a bit more. \n\nIf it\u2019s someone else\u2019s expensive event I get a sitter for my young kids.

Had it on her wrist during th wedding vows.  Admittedly this was in the middle ages but I bet that's why birds are in there!  :D", "I don\u2019t know if they\u2019d cover it as \u201cfish\u201d as arthropods weren\u2019t listed. But bearing in mind you can\u2019t have food in the room for x amount of time before or during, you couldn\u2019t even argue that. They also had a catch all clause for anything they hadn\u2019t considered down to discretion.", "Maybe people are trying to get birds to do ring deliveries?", "Wouldn't surprise me in the slightest.  They'd have better luck with that than with children tbh."]}
