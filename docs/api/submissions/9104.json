It sounds like sis made a pretty (American) standard wedding request for no smaller kids because kids under 5 are notorious for being disruptive which, by your own admission, is likely to happen with your daughter. I understand that you must feel incredibly defensive on your daughters behalf but your sister isn\u2019t discriminating against your child *who you admit is likely to have a meltdown during a very important event* she is trying to save everyone- INCLUDING your special needs daughter- from an incredibly uncomfortable afternoon. \n\nYTA- learn to accept boundaries graciously and teach the same to your kids. It\u2019s an essential skill in life.", "YTA. You\u2019re setting a bad precedent.", "Oh, boy.  The thing is, we get a lot a LOT of posts from adults here with ND siblings whose parents insisted the ND sibling HAD to be included in everything.  Going to a classmate's birthday party?  Then your nonverbal high needs autistic sibling has to go or you can't go, because the sibling has no friends and will never get to experience this otherwise.  Going to the movies with your friends?  Then the sibling has to come too, even though they will get overstimulated and start screaming and everyone will get thrown out.   Going for a walk in the park with a boyfriend?  The sibling has to go along.  \n\nWe all know how where this will end, in twenty to thirty years.  \"NT, we're getting older and we can't take of Sibling anymore.  You need to step up and take responsibility.  No?  What do you mean, no?  What do you mean, she ruined every event in your life?\"\n\nI think the OP means well, but they need some perspective.    Soft YTA, and talk to someone professional about navigating these murky waters before they come to my predicted conclusion.", "YTA. Age restrictions at a wedding are common. Please don\u2019t weaponize this completely normal request.", "Yeah, YTA.  Quite a lot really, as there are two distinct and severe fails here:\n\n1 -- You ain't teachin the 7yr old about 'it's not okay to exclude family'.  You are literally excluding her, a member of the family. Christ, the effort it must be taking you, to not see that.\n\n2 -- Punishing/limiting the NT child for the benefit of the NNT child is EXACTLY how you wind up looking after NNT child yourself while NT child calls once every few years, a few years down the road.  It's real bad parenting.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you actually want to teach a message about family unity, then just don't go.  That would fix problem 1 and make you less of a hypocrite, but it would still leave problem 2.", "YTA. \"No under 5s\" is pretty reasonable imo, there's a good chance you're reading into it too much. Sounds like a compromise rather than fully child-free. Also, you're punishing your 7 year old daughter for your sister's choice, something your daughter has literally no say in, which is just weird.", "YTA. You are punishing one child to make the point you feel your other child was excluded. If you feel that strongly your entire family should stay home.", "N T A if you also stay home. *That* would be teaching your kids it's not okay to exclude family due to a disability.\n\nGoing yourself, while leaving them home is *not* teaching them this lesson nearly as effectively.\n\n> Since it is my sister I don't feel right missing her wedding so we are going without the girls and my in-laws will watch them that night. \n\nThis makes me say YTA tho. You aren't teaching her a lesson. You're sacrificing her wants to teach your sister a lesson, a lesson you're not willing to teach her yourself.", "YTA.  This isn\u2019t a teaching moment for your 7 year old, it\u2019s a punishment.  If you want to teach her that\u2019s it\u2019s wrong to exclude her sister, then you should all stay home.  What you are teaching her by going without her is that she will be punished for her sisters exclusion.  She will learn to resent and hate her sister.", "YTA for causing your 7yr old to miss out while the rule per your correction is \"no kids **5 and under** \". I understand you feel like the rule was made to slight your kid but Sometimes its not exactly about them. Maybe your sister probably really wanted a child-free wedding but knew she wouldn't have a alot attendees if she did that so she tried to find a compromise for her wedding.", "YTA In 15 years you will be posting asking how you could have made such a mistake restricting your NT child in a misguided effort to be fair to your autistic child. \n\nAnd wondering if she will be no contact for ever and what you should do.", "YTA. Your sister didn\u2019t create a situation, you did. You\u2019re creating resentment, not your sister. You\u2019re pushing your daughter for nothing. Three for three. You\u2019re the problem here. Not your sister", "YTA. You going to the wedding while leaving 7yo home with her sister to teach her not to exclude people with disabilities is a double standard. You shouldn't be going either. On top of this, you're potentially fostering ill feelings in your 7yo towards 5yo. Either you don't go as well, or just bring 7yo without 5yo.", "YTA.  Her rule is perfectly reasonable, and no 'we'd take her out if she had a melt down' is NOT an acceptable plan for a wedding in this circumstance.  The fact that you don't understand that tells me the happy couple has very, very good reason for excluding your daughter.     \n\n\nAlso, you're teaching your 7 year old that she will always come second fiddle to your favorite child, and that her wants and needs are unimportant.    You need to rearrange your thinking or she's not going to contact you as an adult.", "YTA. Yes, your child is ND, but your sister's rule is a common rule at weddings to ensure that everyone involved enjoys themselves. Unless you have seen your sister intentionally exclude your youngest daughter from other events before, then you're being an overly sensitive AH. If your sister has excluded your daughter before, then you're still the AH for keeping someone like that in your life and modeling that tolerance of intolerant behavior for your daughters. \n\nOn top of that, keeping both girls home makes it look like you just want to party kid-free at the event rather than teach a lesson about fairness and inclusion.", "YTA. This is a common rule. Take your 7 year old and enjoy the wedding. Don\u2019t be that person that makes someone else\u2019s wedding about themselves and feels like the rules should be changed for their child.", "INFO: How young are the other two under-5 children who are also being excluded?", "INFO: why does your older child has to suffer the consequences of your 5-year-old? Is this something that happens often?\n\nAnd how are you sure she is purposely excluding your child? You said there were two other children under 5 who couldn't go?", "YTA\n\nIf that is the lesson you want to teach your daughter (and your sister) then you shouldn't be going either. This is a double standard and you're choosing to exclude one daughter who is clearly looking forward to it while having a good time at the wedding yourself.\n\nGet yourselves dressed up with both kids and give them a good day if you feel that strongly about the rule.", "Soft YTA. I think it's fair to want something like a wedding to go how you envision it, and children are often excluded for this reason. It's unfortunately not up to you to make up the rules on this one. I don't think punishing your other daughter is the best course of action here though, as she would be the one suffering for your pettiness. Your youngest daughter doesn't seem like she would care to go, so I don't particularly think there is much harm done in this specific situation. It's not like she won't be welcome at family gatherings in the future (and if she isn't, *then* I would definitely make this a larger issue). This is your sister's wedding, not a time to make it about yourself.", "YTA. You are denying your older kid experiences she would enjoy because her sister wouldn\u2019t be able to go. Why are you only concerned with your younger daughter?", "YTA\n\n>My sister made a rule about her wedding no kids under 5, which I think was a \"polite\" way of excluding my disabled child.\n\nYour disabled child is 5 years old, so......no?\n\n>As my 6 year old nephew (also neurotypical) just \"made the cut\" and gets to go\n\nWhat's with the quotes around \"made the cut\"? He's 6, which is above the \"no kids under 5\" rule, so obviously he gets to go.\n\n>Since it is my sister I don't feel right missing her wedding so we are going without the girls and my in-laws will watch them that night.\n\nThis is your only saving grace here - that you're not skipping out on your sister's wedding, you're just choosing not to bring the kids.", "I think you're being sensitive but whatever. I wouldn't want a screaming child at my wedding but I also get why you don't want your kid to be excluded. At the end of the day, everyone is entitled to their choice NAH", "NAH Your sister isn't an asshole for wanting a quiet ceremony for her wedding.  You're not an asshole for wanting to include your daughter, but this isn't your party and you know what, not everyone can always go to everything. \n\n There are so many threads on here of the NT child being denied party's and playdates because they have a ND sibling who can't go. I see it at our school all the time.  Unless a party parent can accommodate 4 additional siblings 2 in wheelchairs then the invited child can't go.  I realise this is your own family but it sounds like they're usually supportive and loving, please don't ruin everyone's experience of this, especially your own daughter.", "A very soft YTA.   Your younger child will not be included in things your older one will.   And you are teaching your older one that rules apply to her, not you.   Children 5 and under might be unusual, but not rude.  Someone else you do not know may have a 4 year old not toilet trained.   There could be many issus.", ">She's upset she doesn't get to go, and my sister says I'm fostering resentment but I think Im teaching my daughter it's not okay to exclude family due to a disability. \n\nI don't think that lesson is going to land the way you think it will. And I actually do think it will breed resentment. The problem with it is that you are still going to the wedding. You aren't teaching your seven year old that it's wrong to exclude her sister because of her disabilities, so much as you're teaching her that exclusion will be forced upon her too. If you want her to learn that exclusion isn't okay, you have to miss the wedding too. If you want her to learn that she'll be punished when things are unfair to her sister, keep doing what you're doing.\n\nSo for this I'm gonna say YTA unless you decide to also not go.", "YTA. What else will you require your daughter -- but not you! you don't have to miss something you would really like to do! -- to miss out on because her sister can't handle it?\n\nIf you want to say \"entire family or nothing\", whatever. But you are saying your daughter has to lose out for her sister (who, it seems, would not even want to go to the wedding), but not you.", "YTA- regardless of reason, you chose not to bring your daughter and then used your other daughter as an excuse and blamed it on your sister.\n\nInstead of just communicating with everyone, including your children, you blamed your sister. You are the parent and how you chose to treat your own children is squarely on your shoulders, no one else\u2019s.  Does your other daughter even want to go to the wedding?  Does she even care?\n\nAs someone who has a disabled sibling, I was always left out because it was \u201ceveryone or no one\u201d sort of situation and it just made me resent that sibling and those adults because no one even asked for our personal opinion. Don\u2019t fall into this trap. There will be plenty of times where one siblings wants to do something and the other doesn\u2019t or it\u2019s not appropriate for both.", "YTA.\n\nYou are making an awful lot of assumptions. NT or not, kids under 5 are often unpredictable.  I myself have seen 2-3 year olds running around at family gatherings screaming, throwing things and their parents were just sitting on their phones. Totally reasonable rule. \n\n(That said, i hope she would make an exception for an infant). \n\nI feel like you are being a bit overly sensitive and i can understand wanting to protect your 5 year old but it may not even be about her being ND.", "YTA - the only person being punished here is your 7 year old. If you really cared about making a point about your youngest not being invited then you wouldn't go yourself. Not inviting under 5s is a common enough rule, there has to be a cutoff somewhere. There will be rides that your older daughter can go on because she will be over a certain height. Eventually your older daughter will be old enough to drink, vote, drive, have sex and the younger won't. Not allowing her not to do things because her sister can't will definitely foster resentment.", "YTA. If you're mad at your sister, punish your sister. Your 7 year old is basically getting a consequence/punishment when she did nothing wrong. I understand you think you're teaching her about inclusion, but if you're going to the wedding you're not teaching her that lesson at all. She's the only one, by how you have explained it, who was explicitly invited but is not going to attend. I don't see why you're handling it this way - either skip out on the wedding yourself or let your daughter go.", "INFO: have you had this conversation with your sister? Is there any possibility that this is a very misguided way of being \u201chelpful\u201d, so that now you don\u2019t have to decide whether you should bring your younger child?\n\nIt\u2019s tough to say without knowing what her motivation is. If it\u2019s because she thinks she\u2019s making it easier for you, then at least it is coming from a good place. You can tell her what you said here - you and your spouse have an action plan in case your younger one needs a break. \n\nIf it is because she\u2019s worried about disruptions in her wedding, I get why you would be defensive. On the other hand, has there been any experiences lately at other events that could cause concern? And I say lately because you can\u2019t compare any kid at 5yo to their younger self and expect the same behavior. \n\nOr maybe she just really hates those twins and at least one other kid had to take one for the team so it wouldn\u2019t be so obvious. /s\n\nMaybe there is a compromise to be had as well. Bring the 7yo to the ceremony only so she can get her fill of princess stuff. Have your spouse spend that time with your 5yo doing something she loves to do during some special one-on-one time.

It's either all 4 of you go or none of you.", "YTA. Why are you hellbent on taking the younger daughter somewhere she will be miserable? At least at age 3 my son could tell us he needed to leave a party when he was overwhelmed, without a meltdown. You aren\u2019t thinking about what is best for anyone around you. And who would get to deal with both kids when the younger was done\u2014 your wife, because it\u2019s your sister\u2019s wedding, right?

Children at weddings is commonly a debated topic.  Will other five and unders be there?  If not, it's fair.  It's not uncommon at all for couples to have a child free wedding, or to only welcome older children. The fact that you stated a contingency plan, already suggests you should self reflect as to whether it's appropriate to bring your younger daughter, regardless of age restrictions.\n\nYour daughter, by your own account, vehemently wants to go.  There is absolutely no reason for her not to, when you and your wife are attending.\n\nPeople who have already said this are right.  There are posts here regularly from adults dealing with being sidelined or prohibited from regular activities they want because their parents are trying to make things fair.  \n\nIt's not fair.  It's not fair to your younger daughter she isn't going to get the experience your older can.  It's not fair to your older to daughter to limit her experiences for someone else, regardless of who they are.\n\nIs your younger daughter actually going to mourn missing the wedding?  Because your seven year old will, and hold in the back of her mind into adulthood.", "Your children are different people. That\u2019s doesn\u2019t mean you love one less than the other. It just means that going through life will be a different journey for each of them. Sometimes one will get to do things that the other won\u2019t be able to do. That\u2019s life.

She\u2019ll probably also love the fact that she gets to do something with you on her own. YTA of course but it\u2019s not too late for you to make it right.", ">You shouldn't be going either.\n\nAgreed. All her daughter is going to learn is that it's okay for adults to try and instill rules they're not willing to follow themselves.", "Three year old twins, but they live on the other side of the country", "I think the last point is what makes OP the AH in a way.\n\nWhat lesson is she teaching the older kid if she's still going to the event herself? \"We're showing the host you can't pick and choose which family to invite to a wedding, so you're staying home while we go.\"", "My partner never went anywhere as a kid because his ND brother couldn't handle going a lot of places. It's hard to explain to a kid why they missed out.", "Check my edit, my mistake the rule is no kids 5 and under (I double checked with my sister and ND daughter is not invited but NT daughter is due to \"age\")", "Question:  how do you know the rule was instituted to exclude a disability?  There's a lot of assumption going in  here about the motive of the exclusion.", "Right? \"I think Im teaching my daughter it's not okay to exclude family due to a disability.\" If that's true then YOU should skip the wedding, too.", "No they specified there are 2 other kids this cuts off, both neurotypical. Hard to say if that\u2019s a lot without knowing the whole family size, or if it\u2019s targeting the kid", "Except the cut off is \"No kids under 5\" and both of OP's kids are 5 or older.", "She did not exclude one niece and not the other- she excluded all children 5 and under. OP glosses over the fact that three children, 5 and under) were excluded.", ">OP says they would take daughter outside when they need to but that ignores the initial disruption, time taken to do so etc.\n\nIt also ignores putting the kid in distress in the first place. I don't think kids with autism have meltdowns for fun", "Stop making it about your daughter. It\u2019s not just about your daughter.\n\nShe drew a fair like. She is avoiding toddler meltdowns (which does not only include your daughters meltdowns).\n\nI understand the need to protect your child, but in no way is this about your child and stop making it about your child. \n\nYTA", "I'm all for child-free weddings, but you sister chosen to draw a line. It's fair for us to examine that line, and you're not the asshole for questioning it to get a substantial reason for where it was placed.\n\nThe rule arbitrarily cuts off consecutive children *(your 5 year-old, another 6 year-old, and your 7 year-old)*. 5 is closer in maturity to 6 than it is to 3, so why not make the rule *\"no child 4 or younger\"* and that way no cousins are cut off from their peers, let alone sisters?\n\nGiven the above, I'll say NTA. You are making your children's experiences fair in response to an unfair *(or at the very least completely arbitrary)* situation. Your sister should have been able to provide proper reasoning for why she's cutting off the 5 year-old from the 6 and 7 year-olds and treating her the same as the 3 year-olds, and I believe your suspicions are not unfounded.", "All children 5 and under are excluded - stop looking for ways to be insulted here.", "Your older daughter is gonna hate you for all that she realizes you made her miss over the years cause \"her disabled sibling couldn't do that\".\n\nThey're of equal value as human beings, but they're not identical people who will have identical potential, opportunity and lives and *this is normal*. You can't drive your younger daughter forward to do everything the older one is doing, so you're settling for keeping the older one back, ensuring the older one is gonna grow to resent you or her sister when she looks back on it one day.", "But two other kids are also excluded by the age rule so it doesn\u2019t seem to be anything to do with your daughter specifically. Maybe you\u2019re just being sensitive (for want of a better word) because she\u2019s your daughter. Are you bothered that the twins won\u2019t be there, regardless of where they live? It\u2019s also a possibility that children you don\u2019t even know about won\u2019t be able to attend.\n\nLots of people have completely child free weddings, I don\u2019t see an age cut off being any different. \n\nGoing with NAH", "Oh would you look at that clarification. \n\nYou'll also note that his family is the only one with kids on either side of the cutoff and to my understanding, his kid would have been included if the cutoff were no kids under five and that this wouldn't have included any other kids.", "I trust OP to have understood the implications of the restriction, but not perfectly communicated it here.\n\nYou should try it. It's tiring both being a pedant and talking to one.", "No matter what age they chose it is going to feel arbitrary.", "How is it arbitrary? It's exactly in the place where she's cuting off the children likely to be disruptive, *even if* she's taking into account the disability. \n\nThe line is exactly where it should be placed; the children invited are the children who can be relied on to behave themselves and not ruin the ceremony and the party, which is the point of shelling out tens of thousands of dollars as typically happens.", "Except there's a clear difference between the 3 year-old toddlers and the 5 year-old who could be in the same kindergarten class as her 6 year-old cousin.\n\nChoosing 5 as it just so happens to cut off one child who is in the same maturity range as another who gets to go is not sufficient enough of a reason. The sister should've decided to go child-free or selected a cut-off that gives a clear delineation. OP isn't TA for finding this to be unfair when there's a clearer line that could be drawn at 4.", "> The line is exactly where it should be placed; the children invited are the children who can be relied on to behave themselves and not ruin the ceremony and the party\n\nThen that would make the Age Cut-Off arbitrary. At that point it's not an Age thing, it's a behavior thing. The sister trying to explain it away as age when there's no magic behavior difference between a 5 and a 6 year-old, they could be in the same classroom at school and likely are only a handful of months apart.\n\nThe sister isn't calling her policy what it is and is trying to say it's about a number she herself selected but can't explain. OP isn't TA for raising an eyebrow at that. \n\nLike I said, I'm all for completely child-free weddings, but when you draw a line people are allowed to take an issue with that, especially when the fairer cut-off of 4 keeps the toddlers at home and doesn't split the cousins who were born within the same 365-day span as each other other.", "Wait.   You do realize that 4 is just as arbitary as 5, right ?  Why not 3?  I know some three year olds who are legit well behaved little charmers that I'd take out for the day while their 6 year old cousins...  : /", "You do realize like 5 is an even number in years. People do cutoffs for age as following \n\n5 years\n10 years\n16 years (due to milestone)\n18 years (due to milestone)\n21 years (due to milestone)\nThen after 25 years it is either every 5-10 years\n\nSo the 5 year rule actually makes sense when you think about it", "The point of the age cutoff is to create the behavior cutoff in a polite way, in any situation, not just here. It just happens it all nicely aligns here too. 5 and under can't be trusted to behave, 6+ can. \n\nIf there were an exceptionally well-behaved 5 year old in the mix, then his parents might have grounds to stand on to question why the line is where it is, but OP knows very well which one of his daughters is more likely to screech as the bride walks down the aisle.", "There are five children surrounding the cut-off. Their ages are 3, 3, 5, 6, 7.\n\nThe toddlers at 3 are closer in maturity to each other. As are the consecutive cousins at 5, 6, and 7. The 5 and 6 year-olds will even both be six at some point in this year, they would be assigned the same grade when they go to kindergarten *(or they already are)*.\n\n4 gives a full year's worth of maturity separating the age groups. The 5 year-old being treated like the toddlers just because her birthday didn't come before the wedding this year is an arbitrary cut-off when 4 is more numerically fair and doesn't separate siblings and consecutive cousins who grew up together."]}
