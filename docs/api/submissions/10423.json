Furthermore my BMI was really high and he said I would be increasing my risk of cardiovascular disease. Then for two years I worked-out basically 5 days a week, till I got into shape.\n\nIt was during my weight-loss journey that I met my girlfriend (f26), at the gym actually, and we went out for dates and we quickly got into relationship. After we got into a relationship however, things changed. I continued to work on myself and I got into pretty good shape. By contrast, my girlfriend completely halted. She used to be a rock-climber and she completely stopped that. Now her physical activity has basically come to a halt.\n\nNow in the beginning I said nothing, as you don't have to be hyper fit to be healthy and, in the beginning, it was fine. But then things kept getting worse. Eventually she goes to the doctor and he tells her that she has to do something about her weight. During this period, I pushed her to go to the gym but she just didn't make the effort.\n\nThe problem didn't really arise from with this however. The problem came when she asked me to help her eat healthier so she could get her weight under control. As a result, I started making her healthy meals and I tried to make them as tasty as possible. Please note, this took up a lot of time. I tried new recipes and different things to try and make this as easy as I could for her. Before this I would just make chicken in these batches and pop it into the air-fryer before eating (but she ofc didn't like to eat that).\n\nDespite this and pushing her to go to the gym, she told me, the night before last night, that she wasn't losing weight. She promised to me that she hadn't eaten anything extra and that she was going to the gym more frequently.\n\nThen, last night, while looking for my PS5 controller I opened a side-drawer in the loft only to find wrappers and new chocolates. I took it all to her and after she confessed. She told me she had been eating sweets the entire time and would eat from outside when she was at work. At this point, I just get frustrated and exhausted by this and tell her, she needed to go to the gym.\n\nShe started crying and telling me I am fat-shaming her. Now I know how hard losing weight can be but she isn't even trying. She's literally eating jars of Nutella behind my back. I tell her I can't help her, if she can't help herself.\n\nEdit: Now i don't think I am an ass and while most of my friends don't either, some have said that I am fat-shaming her and being an asshole.

You've,  patiently, been there for her.   The DOCTOR told her she had to do loose weight.  Self hate is a real thing.  She needs therapy to find out why she's struggling with this.\n\nI have been through insane trauma lately and I've lost all self control with food.  It's only made me hate myself more that's lead to a loss of interest in other important things.\n\nLying MATTERS.   She manipulated you when she accused you of that.  It's deflection away from her food sickness. \n\nMy husband went to the gym today to renew gym membership.  He knows that I'll make excuses if he hadn't done that.  It's a gift of love!

What happened to her?\n\nDid she get hurt?\n\nWas there a trauma that triggered an eating disorder? (Binge eating is also an eating disorder.)

When I was slowly gaining weight I asked my boyfriend if he could keep me accountable, and he did, but I was binging food behind his back and kept gaining until I reached 200lbs. Not once did I ever blame it on him, he tried everything, making sure I had enough fruit (I had a bad sweet tooth so we tried to kind of replace it with fruits then slowly cut a lot of the sugar I was eating out, which was a lot believe me) but I still went and got pastries and stuff. After a hard crying while being barely able to walk for a couple of minutes, I figured I\u2019m sick of it and got my act together.

She knows she has a problem, or she wouldn't have tried to hide it. It sounds like she is using food for something other than nutrition.\n\nAlso, I think you overvalue the gym. There are other places to exercise if gym isn't working for her. When I worked at a sports centre, we used to make fun of people who paid to use gym equipment. We got paid to move heavy things, and they paid money to do almost identical movements.", "NTA- you did a lot of labor in order to help her.

Even the doctor told her to do something about jt and she got worse on purpose.", "Reading this made me remember I had chocolate in my purse. Gonna give you a NTA purely for that reason.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't say anything wrong because she is the only one that can change her behaviour.  However telling her to go to the gym more probably won't help.  Even if she does go, she'll be more hungry afterwards and probably eat even more jars of nutella.", " NTA. You tried to be supportive at her request and she sabotaged it herself.", " NTA - she was fit and athletic, she definitely understands the concept of a calorie deficit. \n\nThis is a mental health issue and or a self discipline issue, not a diet issue. She is eating secretly, and has completely changed her lifestyle, something is wrong here. Maybe she feels now that she has a boyfriend, she doesn\u2019t have to take care of herself. Maybe she\u2019s stressed out about life issues and binging. \n\nGoing forward, don\u2019t cook for her. What you did was very kind and supportive. As someone trying to lose weight and is snacky, I know it takes a ton of effort to cook healthy and tasty and she doesn\u2019t care enough to follow up on her end of the weight loss journey. You can pass on the recipes to her but make it her responsibility to take care of herself. Invite her to the gym every time you go!", "It sounds like she might be depressed and need support (professional support) for the binge/secret eating. \n\nI can tell you really care and you can\u2019t make a person change unless they\u2019re ready to. Encouraging her to go to therapy might be more helpful at this juncture than encouraging her to go to the gym.", "ESH, but a gentle one for both of you. Her sneaking chocolate behind your back plus the change in her activity level sounds like there might be some kind of depression and/or disordered eating on her part, which requires more help than just being told to go to the gym. She also might be anxious that you like her less because of her change in exercise and might be reading that into other things you do unintentionally which might be how she arrived at thinking you\u2019re fat-shaming. It sounds like she\u2019s dealing with some tough emotions. That said, she should have been more honest.\n\nYou sound like you really want to help her and it\u2019s great that you are cooking for her. But if going to the gym and having healthy meals isn\u2019t working for her, it sounds like she needs compassion and not pressure. You don\u2019t seem to be asking her why she felt the need to hide her snacking from you, or interrogating why she stopped working out as much. Maybe start there and ask her to talk to you about why she\u2019s struggling. \n\nAlso bear in mind that a lot of doctors are very fatphobic and make people feel terrible about their bodies because they don\u2019t know how to treat heavier people, not because those people are truly unhealthy.", "She\u2019s just being lazy. You\u2019re not wrong and you did your best to be supportive. If this continues, maybe you should consider leaving her. Her attitude can be detrimental to your own goals and you shouldn\u2019t let her drag you down like this especially when it comes to your health.", "NTA jars of Nutella is not just a few chocolates that\u2019s a lot but you do need to help her more besides the diet part", "Edit- changing to ESH, as some comments below make some valid points. I'm wondering if she truly wants to get into shape or if she is just doing it out of guilt for you because you mentioned it in the past. Until she is ready to get back into shape, no shaming, nagging, or ultimatums will ever work. You can offer to take a walk with her and keep cooking healthy, but until she has that desire, nothing you do will help.", "As you already know, losing weight is not easy. It's not a decision everybody can take in a blink of an eye...for some people, a th\u00e9rapist and /or a specialist must be involved coz its more something that happen in your head that in your mouth...eating can be a way of finding comfort when things aren't right....abd no matter how healhty you eat or how much you exercise, if you ain't right in your head it won't work....so i guess she is feelinf really low, maybe depressed and went for food to feel better coz she couldn't talk to you....\nSo soft yta for blowing at her instead of comforting her: it eally hurts when you wish to lose weight, whe  you feel fat while you hate it...but can't bring your mind to feel better and to stop rush into food...it's really not that simple as: go to the gym....", "YTA. Us fat people don\u2019t need you tell us we\u2019re fat we no.", "YTA soft...\n\nShe asked for help eating healthier and it sounds like you tried but the chocolate confrontation followed by disappointment and getting frustrated with her was absolutely not going to help her at all.\n\nHealthier way would be to encourage activity together. Hey remember how much you used to love rock climbing? I\u2019ve been wanting to learn - will you teach me? Hey you\u2019re doing great - its ok to splurge and cheat sometimes. Healthier to allow cheats than to never build in any fun in the diet. Let\u2019s work together on a plan we   can both follow with built in treats for our sweet tooth!  Those would be so much less toxic than making her feel worse about her body. \n\nAlso fyi - that age os around the time that a lot of autoimmune disorders and other medical problems start to manifest and it\u2019s possible that the inability to lose weight is tied to thyroid issues, autoimmune disorders, stress and depression, genetics, or any number of things that it doesn\u2019t sound like her doctor tested her for.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ya\u2019ll are just bullying and it\u2019s sad.", ">It\u2019s not evil to not want your fianc\u00e9 to die young.\n\nBeing fat = dying young.\nAnd smoking = it's definitely lung cancer.\nOne drop of alcohol = immediate liver failure.\n\nHave you ever talked to a physician that actually knows how to do their job? Telling people they'll die because they're overweight is outright malpractice and reason to revoke their license.", ">Well considering her weight gain has been going on for over a year, I think it\u2019s safe to say his way isn\u2019t working. \n\nThey weren't doing his way. She was actively lying to him about that.\n\nIt turns out, her way of stuffing her face isn't working.", "Nice one sided view you got going there buddy.\nFocus on the \"fat-shaming\" neglect the rest of the story.\nWhen people disagree whit you, blame it on men or low intellect...\nShame, maybe you should do something whit your Anger.", "I am leaving it to her doctor. Her doctor said she needs to lose weight. If her doctor told her to stop smoking and she was sneaking cigarettes I\u2019d feel the same way. Why do you assume to know more than her doctor?", "I don\u2019t need to. She talk to her doctor. He said to lose weight. Are you her doctor?", "But have you tried to think from OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9\u2019s perspective? She is obviously going through something and all OP cares about is getting her back in the gym to lose that weight. If she has a mental health problem hitting the gym isn\u2019t gonna help her. Everyone on here agrees that OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t healthy, that\u2019s not what we\u2019re discussing. We\u2019re determining whether or not OP should apologize for hurting her feelings when she was at a very low point. But because she is overweight, her feelings suddenly don\u2019t matter to any of you. **That\u2019s** truly one sided.", "How do you know her physician told her she could die young? Are you her physician? \n\nAlso, who told you her physician wrote a dissertation and achieved the title of doctor? You don't need a doctorate to work as a general practitioner.", "I can spend some time googling the stats on being overweight if you really want me to? \n\n\u201cOverweight and obesity are the fifth leading risk for global deaths. At least 2.8 million adults die each year as a result of being overweight or obese. 44% of the diabetes burden, 23% of the ischaemic heart disease burden and between 7% and 41% of certain cancer burdens are attributable to overweight and obesity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIndividuals who are obese (BMI > 30)* have a 50 to 100% increased risk of premature death from all causes, compared to individuals with a healthy weight.\u201d\n\nGeneral practitioners become \u201cdoctors\u201d when they graduate from medical school/finish an internship even if they do not choose to enter a residency program for developing a specialty (orthopedic surgery, dermatology, internal medicine, etc.). They have completed medical coursework that determines their doctoral level.", "Why do I get the feeling you're overweight and coping when I read your response?\nObesity is bad. If you want to be fat, that's your choice and it's perfectly valid. Saying it's healthy and being this defensive is just a cope though.", "My point is not to just assume that's what it is. Always, always assume good intent and look for a source. If it IS depression or another issue (and the hiding food and binge eating behavior isn't normal), then that has to be addressed before anything else. Physical and mental health are closely related and often dismissed or misunderstood.\n\nEdit to add: in also speaking from personal experience. It is very easy to just assume people get lazy or comfortable.", "It\u2019s not just this but she flat out lied to him about not eating and have been going to the gym. She can\u2019t be trusted . He\u2019s been putting in a lot of time and effort for her and coming up with new recipes to suit her when he mentioned he could just dump the chicken and air fry it for himself. It was all for her. \n\nHowever instead of being grateful to her boyfriend\u2019s effort, she lied to him leaving him wondering what went wrong especially when she keeps bringing up that she isn\u2019t losing weight. And when she finally got caught, she gaslighted him and said he\u2019s the one at fault because he\u2019s fat shaming her. \n\nShe\u2019s the TA and doesn\u2019t deserve a pass from this."]}
