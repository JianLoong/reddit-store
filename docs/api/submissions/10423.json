{"id": 10423, "submission_id": "116ytw6", "title": "AITA for telling my girlfriend she needs to go to the gym?", "selftext": "About two yeas ago, my doctor had told me that I (m27 now) needed to lose some weight as I was a pre-diabetic and at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Furthermore my BMI was really high and he said I would be increasing my risk of cardiovascular disease. Then for two years I worked-out basically 5 days a week, till I got into shape.\n\nIt was during my weight-loss journey that I met my girlfriend (f26), at the gym actually, and we went out for dates and we quickly got into relationship. After we got into a relationship however, things changed. I continued to work on myself and I got into pretty good shape. By contrast, my girlfriend completely halted. She used to be a rock-climber and she completely stopped that. Now her physical activity has basically come to a halt.\n\nNow in the beginning I said nothing, as you don't have to be hyper fit to be healthy and, in the beginning, it was fine. But then things kept getting worse. Eventually she goes to the doctor and he tells her that she has to do something about her weight. During this period, I pushed her to go to the gym but she just didn't make the effort.\n\nThe problem didn't really arise from with this however. The problem came when she asked me to help her eat healthier so she could get her weight under control. As a result, I started making her healthy meals and I tried to make them as tasty as possible. Please note, this took up a lot of time. I tried new recipes and different things to try and make this as easy as I could for her. Before this I would just make chicken in these batches and pop it into the air-fryer before eating (but she ofc didn't like to eat that).\n\nDespite this and pushing her to go to the gym, she told me, the night before last night, that she wasn't losing weight. She promised to me that she hadn't eaten anything extra and that she was going to the gym more frequently.\n\nThen, last night, while looking for my PS5 controller I opened a side-drawer in the loft only to find wrappers and new chocolates. I took it all to her and after she confessed. She told me she had been eating sweets the entire time and would eat from outside when she was at work. At this point, I just get frustrated and exhausted by this and tell her, she needed to go to the gym.\n\nShe started crying and telling me I am fat-shaming her. Now I know how hard losing weight can be but she isn't even trying. She's literally eating jars of Nutella behind my back. I tell her I can't help her, if she can't help herself.\n\n1st Edit: Now i don't think I am an ass and while most of my friends don't either, some have said that I am fat-shaming her and being an asshole. AITA?\n\n2nd Edit: grammar, spelling and clarification\n\n**3rd Edit:** People have been questioning the diet plan I made for her. So it's a basic caloric deficit plan with 2 cheat meals but on the same day. Without going into too much detail about the specifics, my father is Italian and my mother is Lebanese, so I took some recipes from mediterranean diets. I calculated out the specific calories in portion sizes. I made slight substitutions to try and get less calorically dense alternatives.\n\nI know she loves mediterranean food, so I thought I could make her a diet surrounding the cuisine. I read some studies showing how mediterranean diets tend to be high in nutrient in addition to being good for weight loss as well.\n\nPlease note, while I am not a nutritionist, I do have a friend who is. He approved of the plan and guided me where he thought it may be better to do things differently.\n\n\\*\\*\\*The only thing I completely cut from the plan was sodas/pops. Diet Soda (those with 0 calories) were completely fine but I recommended she take those in moderation.

Gonna give you a NTA purely for that reason.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't say anything wrong because she is the only one that can change her behaviour.

You tried to be supportive at her request and she sabotaged it herself.", " NTA - she was fit and athletic, she definitely understands the concept of a calorie deficit. \n\nThis is a mental health issue and or a self discipline issue, not a diet issue. She is eating secretly, and has completely changed her lifestyle, something is wrong here. Maybe she feels now that she has a boyfriend, she doesn\u2019t have to take care of herself. Maybe she\u2019s stressed out about life issues and binging. \n\nGoing forward, don\u2019t cook for her. What you did was very kind and supportive. As someone trying to lose weight and is snacky, I know it takes a ton of effort to cook healthy and tasty and she doesn\u2019t care enough to follow up on her end of the weight loss journey.

Encouraging her to go to therapy might be more helpful at this juncture than encouraging her to go to the gym.", "ESH, but a gentle one for both of you. Her sneaking chocolate behind your back plus the change in her activity level sounds like there might be some kind of depression and/or disordered eating on her part, which requires more help than just being told to go to the gym. She also might be anxious that you like her less because of her change in exercise and might be reading that into other things you do unintentionally which might be how she arrived at thinking you\u2019re fat-shaming. It sounds like she\u2019s dealing with some tough emotions. That said, she should have been more honest.\n\nYou sound like you really want to help her and it\u2019s great that you are cooking for her. But if going to the gym and having healthy meals isn\u2019t working for her, it sounds like she needs compassion and not pressure. You don\u2019t seem to be asking her why she felt the need to hide her snacking from you, or interrogating why she stopped working out as much. Maybe start there and ask her to talk to you about why she\u2019s struggling. \n\nAlso bear in mind that a lot of doctors are very fatphobic and make people feel terrible about their bodies because they don\u2019t know how to treat heavier people, not because those people are truly unhealthy.", "She\u2019s just being lazy. You\u2019re not wrong and you did your best to be supportive. If this continues, maybe you should consider leaving her. Her attitude can be detrimental to your own goals and you shouldn\u2019t let her drag you down like this especially when it comes to your health.", "NTA jars of Nutella is not just a few chocolates that\u2019s a lot but you do need to help her more besides the diet part", "Edit- changing to ESH, as some comments below make some valid points. I'm wondering if she truly wants to get into shape or if she is just doing it out of guilt for you because you mentioned it in the past. Until she is ready to get back into shape, no shaming, nagging, or ultimatums will ever work. You can offer to take a walk with her and keep cooking healthy, but until she has that desire, nothing you do will help.", "[deleted]", "YTA.

Hey remember how much you used to love rock climbing? I\u2019ve been wanting to learn - will you teach me? Hey you\u2019re doing great - its ok to splurge and cheat sometimes. Healthier to allow cheats than to never build in any fun in the diet. Let\u2019s work together on a plan we   can both follow with built in treats for our sweet tooth!  Those would be so much less toxic than making her feel worse about her body. \n\nAlso fyi - that age os around the time that a lot of autoimmune disorders and other medical problems start to manifest and it\u2019s possible that the inability to lose weight is tied to thyroid issues, autoimmune disorders, stress and depression, genetics, or any number of things that it doesn\u2019t sound like her doctor tested her for.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That was probably your barely free three hour window and you spent it trying to help your partner. I think you are absolutely not an asshole but as someone who has her entire life struggled with impulsive eating there\u2019s something going on with your girlfriend emotionally and mentally that is making her refuse self care. At its core, to gain a ton of weight in an unhealthy way (vs someone who maybe is in recovery for ED) is almost always (in my life experience) a cry for help BECAUSE it requires you to basically no longer care for your health and well-being. That kind of shift in someone who previously did care can be emotionally debilitating. When I would binge I struggled to stop so much so I would actually make myself sick from eating and still be unable to stop the pattern over the course of days. Surprise I was working the spac bubble at the time and was desperately struggling with emotional regulation of my negative feelings \u2014 as well the job totally robbed me of any self worth during that time contributing to my need to binge for dopamine. Impulsive shopping impulsive eating impulsive everything \u2014 I also got diagnosed with ADHD which has helped a lot.\n\nThe best advice is going to be for you to genuinely sit down and try to connect with her emotionally. I wouldn\u2019t apologize but I would try to make amends by hearing what in her experience has changed. Maybe hunt down a therapist specializing in this stuff. She may take offense to that, but the truth is, she is actively hurting herself and probably wants to stop but doesn\u2019t know how \u2014 so it\u2019s easier to keep hurting herself. It take a lot of change internally to overcome eating disorders (which she now has) or addiction. I encourage you to see this weight gain as disordered eating patterns and maybe to understand when she was also in shape maybe she was also struggling with disordered eating in the opposite way (restricting to achieve her ideal). You obviously love your partner, so now it\u2019s literally time to dig in \u2014 through thick or thin as they say. Good luck! You can do it!

Since she\u2019s a dietician, she also has reliable information; that said, it still doesn\u2019t compare to seeing a dietician yourself. I really like her recipe ideas, and she simply seems to have a healthy relationship with food (I can\u2019t remember for sure, but she may have suffered from disordered herself at some point\u2026if not, she is clearly very educated in this area and cares about it a lot).\n\nI also said elsewhere that her mental health is likely a huge factor in all of this. If so, that\u2019s something where she will need to actively participate with her doctors. Therapy, individual and couples, is always a good idea - even when there are no problems - but she likely needs to be seen by, at least, her GP and a psychiatrist to rule out any medical component.

I can\u2019t say things will be easy, but I do believe it will be worth it :)\n\nEdit: I\u2019d like to add that my personal belief is that a healthy relationship with food is way more important than going to the gym more. I don\u2019t think you can outrun a bad diet. I would focus on healthy and *satisfying* meals (what is satisfying to her is probably different that what is satisfying to you, so you need her to help you with choosing meal options\u2026don\u2019t just cook for her and expect her to like it). For physical activity, maybe there\u2019s something you can do together?

It\u2019s a sign of dismal self-worth, as they can no long feel happy about themselves without a sugar rush.\n\nSo here\u2019s what the hell actually happened. You are internally motivated to work out, she\u2019s externally. Your gym motivations aligned when you were both single, and now they don\u2019t.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9 sounds like she was motivated to be fit to get someone like you. Maybe she worked out to feel good about herself, when she didn\u2019t normally feel that herself. It\u2019s why her motivation faded when you got together. You proved to her that she was worthy of love, with or without the gym.\n\nBut that\u2019s not your motivation. You were on track to die if you didn\u2019t get fit, and that\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s enough for anyone to get themselves into shape. The threat of you losing your fitness is an early grave and that fear will never leave you. That is an absolutely terrifying thing to confront on your own.\n\nYou probably wanted to tackle this issue together, or at the very least, can see a danger that she doesn\u2019t see. But you pushed too far and she now thinks you won\u2019t love her if she doesn\u2019t meet this expectation by the wedding. \n\nAnxiety is a selfish emotion, because it implies that the world\u2019s problems are your fault. It\u2019s introspection beyond what is considered useful. If something bad has happened, or you are sad or angry, anxiety says it\u2019s your fault. Cold facts mean nothing because it\u2019s irrational. They don\u2019t resolve, because they stem from an emotional place, not a logical one. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have your motivation, and she isn\u2019t able to be aware of why you want her support. She only sees her own weight gain and how it\u2019s a problem for you. She probably also feels betrayed in the same way you do, for not telling her that your love was reliant on her weight. If it wasn\u2019t, why does it suddenly matter?\n\nNone that is true, but it\u2019s what stress and anxiety does to somebody. The anxiety isn\u2019t letting her see past herself. So here\u2019s how you fix it. \n\n1. You gotta be vulnerable with her, and tell her WHY it\u2019s so important for YOU to go to the gym, and how much you need her support to handle the pressure. You need her to understand that YOU need her help, not that you need HER to change. Let the fear in for half a second, so that she can be the one to help. \n\n2. You gotta remind her that your support is always there. That the wedding will go on and that she\u2019s gonna look beautiful regardless of how she spends her time.  You need to remind her that she will always, forever and always, be the person you wanted to marry.\n\n3. Finally, you should reassess yourself and see if you are putting the stress of your fears on her shoulders. Have you successfully averted your health issues already? Can you lay off the pedal, and meet her at a level that she\u2019s comfortable at?", "Except\u2026it\u2019s not the whole story.

It wasn\u2019t a huge deal, and if she had asked rather than just made assumptions that I was lazy, she would have realized that I was losing my mind - my other doctor upped my anti-depressants because I was having such vivid dreams that shouldn\u2019t have been a thing based on the meds I was on. \n\nI\u2019ve since lost the weight?

Seems like she has an issue with binge eating. It can result from some mental health issues like depression. Maybe that's why she's not active anymore either.

She needs a healthy approach towards food and weight loss.", "NTA\n\nIt's basic math. You gotta burn more calories than you consume to lose weight.

You're frustrated that she wants help and isn't putting as much effort as you apparently", "Due to the context provided, I'm going with NTA.\n\nShe asked for help. Then she lied about her progress. And now she is trying to blame you OP.  She is projecting her guilt onto you and that's not ok.\n\nHowever, I am sympathetic to her. I have to wonder though if there is a greater issue with your GF. This is binging behavior and it needs to be addressed; it's not as easy as \"going to the gym and eating healthy\". This could indicate a mental health issue or some other underlying cause.  Most people who are already into physical activity don't just stop for no reason. An injury or a trauma of some kind leads to  a halt in activity, but generally speaking, active people remain pretty active... something else is going on here.\n\nCould you encourage her to talk about WHY she is hiding food and not working out anymore? Maybe she can look into getting a therapist that can help her work through whatever feelings she is having that's leading her to hide food??

Females get the short end of the stick -- more medications than you would think cause weight gain, and a lot more weight than you would think\n\nHow is she working out? Back to rock climbing? Weightlifting? Cardio? Any other type of sport? Try to help her find newer ways to workout, she might enjoy it a lot more and have more motivation. Makes it feel less like she *has* to workout, but she is doing it because it makes her feel good mentally and physically. Could try basketball, soccer, having races between the two of you\n\nFor info that nobody asked for: I am really fast, have always been. A way I try to help friends out with working out, mainly cardio, is just racing them. Whether it is sprinting or long distance running, turning it into a competition is fun and encourages them to push themselves to do their best", "NTA, I feel like you have done what you can to help her, and like you said, she has to help herself.  But I think there may also be something more going on with your GF than she is communicating to you.  It\u2019s pretty drastic of her to just stop all physical activity and resort to just eating her feelings.  Maybe sit down with her and try to have a supportive coversation about why she stopped working out in the first place?", "When I saw the title, I wanted to say yep. But reading NTA. She asked for help. You gave help than says you are fat shaming her cause you are doing exactly what she asked you to do? Nope, she is the AH here.", "NTA, it\u2019s messed up of her to try and make you responsible for her diet. Hiding and lying about food makes this sound like something she needs therapy for, though, as this is clearly disordered eating.", "YTA - if you can't accept her as she is, dump her. She deserves someone who can love her as is.", "Nah. I think there is something else going on and I would stop focusing on weight specifically, but feeling better all together. I also hate the gym and trying to lose weight, but when I started doing things becauwe they made me feel good instead of being on the scale every morning then it got\nBetter.", "NTA\n\nTW: eating disorder \n\nBut, I think that maybe she should look into therapy because hiding food is a sign of an ED. She could be struggling with something and using food as a coping mechanism and she feels the need to hide it because she knows that she needs to get healthier.", "I don\u2019t think you should have confronted your girlfriend about her junk stash. And I don\u2019t think she should have involved you to the extent she did in her health journey. Now, boundaries are all out of wack here!! \n\nShe needs to work with a doctor and a therapist. If you want to stay with this person, I think your role needs to shift to more of an emotional support role - leave the healthy eating coaching to someone she isn\u2019t dating. \n\nYou are NTA, but YWBTA (you both will) if you don\u2019t use this opportunity to reevaluate your roles in the relationship, what you are prepared to offer each other, and what personal/medical boundaries look like for each of you.", "NAH-OP is being a good partner in trying to help her lose weight. I think it\u2019s time to look at other factors as well. OP states that she used to rock climb but has given up on that, she has given up on workouts by out and taken to eating junk food in secret. I\u2019m no doctor but she sounds depressed. She may need counseling and maybe some antidepressants. Binging junk food in secret is not okay and could lead to other eating disorders. OP-Good luck to you and your GF. Hope everything works out.", "NTA", "Nta. But she sounds depressed. If you're continuing to go to the gym you should schedule it around when she is available to as well since it sounds like you're busy with work", "I was really ready to say y-t-a based on your title. However, she asked for help and that\u2019s what your trying to do for her. \n\nIt really sounds like there are some signs of binge eating here though and that\u2019s a real problem that she might need help with.", "NTA but as someone who has struggled with weight issues she needs to want this, she needs to be ready, I can\u2019t say why she\u2019s not ready but she needs to figure that out, maybe with the help of a therapist", "NTA.  but some people are really just not cut out to be gym rats.  i can't stand the gym, but i like activities.  biking, skiing, i'm trying to get into pickleball now.  maybe she is similar.", "NTA because she lied to you. But really, this is about her underlying issues. If you want to overlook the lying and stay with her while she works through those, great. If you don\u2019t, that\u2019s your right but to me you\u2019d kinda be an AH. It\u2019s clear that this diet has created sneak-eating habits *which isn\u2019t healthy.* The solution isn\u2019t just \u201cdon\u2019t do it\u201d or \u201cgo to the gym.\u201d She needs to get to the root of the issue. I mean this in the kindest way possible: you should leave her if you don\u2019t think you\u2019re capable of supporting her and will continue to see it as just a matter of willpower.", "I gave up all soda about 10 years ago (reg and diet), and after the first few months I found that I no longer craved sweets at all. I read somewhere that artificial sweetener tricks your brain into wanting more sweets.", "NTA I think she may be more mad at herself here and probably embarrassed. She asked for your help and you tried. When she did the opposite of taking your help and got caught, now she\u2019s upset. This isn\u2019t on you.", "NTA, you did everything in your power to help her but it sounds like she has an eating disorder and can't just stop eating. Maybe indicate that she should visit a psychologist or a dietitian. If she's suffering from something she won't be able to overcome it without professional help. Talking from personal experience.", "NTA, friend. You put in so much effort only for her to basically destroy it. However, I do wonder if she\u2019s suffering a depression or maybe something else is going on with her.", "NTA but maybe you have to accept that you two are no longer compatible. It isn5 your job to change her and if she isn\u2019t going to make the effort you have to decide if this is acceptable to you", "Yeah, the diet plan includes two cheat meals. We tend to usually order out (only for cheat days, I cook on non-cheat days) or she'll cook something for us both on cheat days. The diet leans towards proteins, legumes, and vegetables but it does include a healthy does of carbohydrates and even a small desert for dinner (usually something I've made either from keto-oats or keto-rice like a cookie or rice-pudding).\n\nAs for sauces, I use tahini a lot and ofc course (its has healthy fats, I make it at home and it's low in calories but high in fiber). As for spices, I use more than plenty I can assure you.\n\nIt is a mediterranean diet plan and I made it using my friend's help (he's a nutritionist).\n\nThat being said, maybe I should reach out and try different sorts of cuisines. I tried some vegetarian options with Indian foods my friend had used when he was trying to lose weight (he is Hindu and he couldn't consume meat). I will definitely check out the link.\n\nMental health could definitely be a huge factor and I will have to talk with her about it to discuss avenues of changes we could make.", "Because part of the problem for someone who overeats is shame.. shame is what propels the eating to create even more shame and guilt, so people around them shaming them even more o let make you stay in the cycle..\nIt\u2019s one of the worst addictions out there because you have to constantly be around what triggers your addiction. You can\u2019t control what other people eat around you. \nIf you want to stop drinking or smoking you can tell everyone around you to not do that around you and not keep it in your house\u2026 but it\u2019s much harder with food specially if your living with other people.\n\nPeople need to feel empowered and supported to be able to get out of binge eating. Most people the binge eat it\u2019s due to emotional neglect as children and they just don\u2019t know a different way to cope and feel supported.", "I\u2019m a girl. I used to be into fitness and nutrition and was on a pretty strict diet for years and then it just stopped. My depression got worse and fitness has become a chore to me. Lo and behold, I just got diagnosed with binge eating disorder. \n\nHow is her mood? Is she tired all the time? I\u2019m always tired and that\u2019s the main reason why I don\u2019t work out. \nIt could be anhedonia which is symptom of depression where you no longer feel joy in the things you do. And depression can come with or without changes in life. \n\nI think the best way you can support her is 1) have her see a female physical trainer and nutritionist who can fit her needs and give her attainable goals. 2) if she can\u2019t see a physical trainer/ nutritionist, I think you can slowly adjust her eating. She doesn\u2019t need to be totally cut off from chocolate. She can have a few pieces to satisfy her craving a day. Portion control and moderation. Definitely have her talk to her doctor about these eating behaviors that could be binge eating and they might be able to help her. Tell her you are worried for her and want her to be healthier. Diabetes and obesity id a risk factor for practically everything. It\u2019s not a matter of fat shaming but being healthy. \n\nI think you\u2019re doing the best that you can and you\u2019re NTA", "I saw this gently, but it sounds like your diet plan is way too restrictive and possibly can contribute to an unhealthy relationship with food, at least for your girlfriend. I\u2019m not a fan of \u201ccheat meals\u201d or \u201ccheat days\u201d because it demonizes certain food choices and can contribute to binge eating developing - or at least feelings of shame. \n\nI did the traditional body builder\u2019s diet over a decade ago, and all I did was OBSESS about my next cheat meal. All I thought about was food because I wasn\u2019t \u201callowed\u201d things I deemed unhealthy. After I lost the weight (and did a competition), I immediately gained all of the weight, plus some more. If my daily \u201csweet treat\u201d were a keto cookie, I would probably be hiding regular candy and Nutella, too.\n\nAgain, it might be perfect for you, but it sounds like your girlfriend needs a different approach. Changing eating habits is HARD, and for many of us it can actually be very emotional\u2026and it\u2019s easy to develop resentment if someone is making food choices for you. Please make sure she is actively participating and *excited* about the recipes.\n\nI was just rewatching some of Abbey\u2019s content, and at the end of December she made a video called \u201cThe Foods I Won\u2019t Eat As A Dietician\u201d that is really great. Also \u201cThe Weight Loss Video I Never Thought I\u2019d Make\u201d from a year ago is excellent. I highly recommend! :) There are a lot of great videos on her channel, but those are more straightforward and revenant to this specific situation than her celebrity reaction diet videos.", "Uh, you can absolutely go cold turkey on entire groups of food.\n\nI know someone who has lost a lot of weight by cutting sweets entirely out of their diet, finally stopping her persistent cravings for them after several months. They don't let themselves have cheat days for it because even a taste of sweets can bring those cravings back.", "What is sensible in this answer?\n\nIf she doesn't drop fucking weight, she will get diabetes and fuckimg cardio vascular diseases and be fucked FOR LIFE.\n\nThis is like saying \"let him jump! It's his life, his choice!!!\"\n\nNo. Your comment is discusting. And the dudes above.\n\nFucking reddit these days.", "What meds are you on that help your binge eating impulses? I need to look into that!", "I'm surprised more people don't realize it could be this simple.", "If you\u2019re visibly obese, you don\u2019t need a doctor to point out that you\u2019re killing yourself. Just as you can see that someone is a chain smoker or drug addict, you can visibly identify an obese person. \n\nThe girlfriend DID NOT ask for help. She lied and asked her SO to take on more work and money to help her, and then deliberately sabotaged his efforts. She is a food addict, she obviously does not have the disciple for small treats and cheat meals.", " Being fat is dangerous for your healthy. Period end of story.", "Thank you and this has been enlightening. I guess I never thought about how my view of fitness was so drastically different from hers and what you are saying is lining up with her fears. Her external motivation vs my internal motivation being a big one there, not to mention the wedding dress concern. She had voiced to me that she wanted to get into better shape before we get married. \n\nI tell her every night that I love her. If anything we have a deal that every night before going to bed, regardless of if we are in a fight or not, we have to say \"I love you\" before we go to bed.\n\nI love her more and more every day. She cares so deeply for me. Before I started cooking for her, she used to prepare my meals (including marinating the chicken) and she still slips in a small note for me in my lunch bag. It's these small things, and also big things, but they all mean a lot to me. \n\nAs for your fixes:\n\n1. I definitely need to do this and, in hindsight, it seems so obvious but I haven't ever told her why I go to the gym. Not to mention how she's always carrying my burden, which is something I deeply appreciate. \n2. I should do this more often.\n3.

Either Im misreading or I dont get your point", "[removed]", "Like your girlfriend I have an inability to stop wanting chocolate, and I can not stand artificial sweeteners. I NEED some sugar.\n\nI went on a similar diet to the one you suggested for your partner. One thing I added that helped me cope was - Greek yoghurt, with chopped pistachios and cocoa powder (or grated high percentage dark chocolate, but if you can get cacao beans or niblets that is better still). Instead of pre-made soda - I had high quality Orange cordial (the expensive stuff made with sugar not sweeteners) or freshly made fruit juice mixed with soda water. I also have homemade couli (basically fruit juice thickened with corn flour and some sugar) that I can use with yoghurt, or add to (soda)water. \n\nIt was these things that enabled me to avoid candy craving. I also allowed myself 2 teaspoons of sugar in my coffee.\n\nOH and NTA. She sabotaged the diet.", "NTA. You went beyond expectations. I\u2019d suggest an experiment. She may have an obsession with sugar like I do. And like me she\u2019s ashamed that it controls her. If you haven\u2019t experienced it, you can\u2019t understand it. The only way to cut the obsession is to remove ALL added sugar and refined flour from diet. No pasta. No honey. No ice cream or chocolate. No diet soda or sugar substitutes. They just make the cravings worse. Lots of veggies and protein. Salad dressing and sauces with added sugar are out. The first few days without sugar are absolute he!! though so it requires a commitment. Cinnamon and fiber can help with feeling full. Low fat cheese is my go to snack.

That\u2019s a natural impulse. You\u2019re using strategies to attack the superficial result of her issues (weight gain) but really you cannot solve her underlying issues for her. That has to come from her. Is she anxious? Is she afraid of marriage? Is she depressed? Was she abused? Does she believe she had missed out on experiences in life, or is she afraid married life will limit her experiences? \n\nI say NAH emphatically here because these questions and issues are hers and hers alone. If you could do one wise thing for yourself, it would be to realize that her ignoring the diet is not about you. It\u2019s about her. If you can avoid entwining you ego in this, it keeps you safe and maybe allows you to help her tease out her issues and seek help from a therapist.

You can't keep putting high effort in to have it not work out, you will only grow resentful. I suspect if you still want to help your effort may be better spent on emotional support and motivation. Sorry your efforts were wasted, it sounds like you really tried to step up for her.", "NTA but laying on the shame and guilt isn't going to help. Chances are she's struggling with the changes to her diet both physically and emotionally (as I'm sure you know being in a calorie deficit can feel like absolute crap, for me it tends to feel like a lingering head cold with headaches, pains, exhaustion, irritability etc. And add onto that, that she may have been using food as a way to cope with things emotionally, these are hard habits to break) \n\nI'd say it might be a good idea to encourage her to look into healthier snack options, preferably things with a lot of protein and moderate amounts of unrefined carbs and healthier fats, as these will be filling and will help keep her going between meals. \n\nI think also, while it's wonderful that you are doing so much to help and support her, it's possible that having a bit more input and involvement would actually help her stick to the diet and feel in control of what she's eating.", "> Please note, while I am not a nutritionist, I do have a friend who is.

I currently don\u2019t play them because everywhere I\u2019ve been has their claw loosened to where it doesn\u2019t matter what you do, you can\u2019t win them. My husband and I have plans to save up to buy ourselves one for me to do since I only consider that to be bad for me because of the cash it saps from my wallet with the \u201cjust one more and maybe I\u2019ll get it\u201d. Which is odd. I\u2019m not like that with lottery machines. Maybe because I feel claws take an amount of skill to aim for the stuffy correctly?", "This is tricky. There's a lot of backlash around weight and appearance and not being negative about it.\nI'd say NTA, but only because I've been in your girlfriend's shoes. \n\nYup, I cheated on my diet and lied about it all the time.\nIf you want to lose the weight, you gotta put in the work. She may know this, but something is overshadowing that simple fact.  I suspect she would benefit from counselling....The weight gain may be a symptom of something else. I say this as someone who currently is benefiting from counselling.\n\nYou have to decide something, though. Are you sticking around for this?  It's  not unreasonable to be upset about the lies.\nI've been lucky on that score, so I hope you will be compassionate and give her a chance to turn it around.  I know it's frustrating and you probably feel hurt and foolish. She didn't mean to make you feel that way. But she probably does need to address *why* she's lying about her food consumption and hiding it.\n\nGood luck.", "NTA, but I hope you spoke with her about what might have happened that triggered this change in lifestyle", "Relationships are the enemy of healthy lifestyles. I've observed this again and again, and I've experienced it in my own relationships. A lot of people just get fat once they're with someone.", "NTA but get her to see a psychologist. I\u2019m not saying that everyone who does this is doing the same thing, but I had a full blown addiction to chocolate before a therapist helped me realise it was a side effect of ADHD and dopamine-seeking behaviours. \n\n\u201cJust eat healthier\u201d and \u201cgo to the gym\u201d mean absolutely nothing if you\u2019re not finding a way to find out WHY she\u2019s eating all of these sweets, because I guarantee once you find the source, it will be so much easier for her to combat. \n\nGood luck to you both!", "NTA\n\nI'm an overweight woman who really struggles to eat healthily.\n\nIf I were your fiancee and you were putting in all that effort to try and help me eat healthy food, I'd be mortified that you found out I was eating junk when I wasn't around you. I could also see myself initially reacting badly to your finding out. I'd blame you for fat shaming me and just be mad in general. After I had time to cool down, I'd probably call you, crying, and apologize. I hope your fiancee just reacted badly because she was embarrassed. I also hope she apologizes.", "NTA! So tired of people these days saying \u201cfat shaming\u201d when it\u2019s like dude, I\u2019m just stating the facts. If you\u2019re embarrassed by it, then do something about it. You\u2019ve tried to help her in multiple ways and she\u2019s secretly sabotaging herself. Do not feel bad at all.", "Esh.  The gym is not the answer to everything.   How many calories are there is the meal plan? \nThat being said i am not one who handles being told i cant eat or drink something , the forbidden fruit. I have everything in my diet, just in moderation.  I am also down 50 from just watching portion sizes.   I even have 2 mini cans of full fat soda a week and treats as needed.   \nMaybe of i cut out things I  would drop weight faster . But it would not be sustainable long terms.  Maybe for her you both need to work together on what a food plan is that she can do and not feel like she is lacking.     Also maybe stop mentioning the gym and her weight etc , that could be stressing and not helping as well.  Maybe some couples therapy .", "She also seems like a fraud for quitting activity once she got a boyfriend.", "Wow. Calm down. I\u2019m not disagreeing that weight is an issue. I\u2019m just saying that making someone feel ashamed of their weight and taking it upon yourself to \u201chelp\u201d them isn\u2019t the way to do it. It may lead to resentment and eating disorders. The person has to want to lose weight and all the other person can do is support them.", "It sounds more like she met her goal than depression. \n\nShe was at the gym to work out, get fit and healthy with a view to meeting someone. After she met someone (OP) she achieved her goal, so everything else fell away as they were only a means to an end and no longer necessary. \n\nI'm going with NTA on this one. \n\nI don't think you're fat shaming her, she came to you for advice and help, you went above and beyond, but she was self sabotaging by eating outside of the plan and behind your back. \n\nShe was also sabotaging your efforts, which was a bit selfish of her, she could have just been honest with both you and herself, that she wasn't serious about that journey. \n\nSince you found the wrappers and sweets and confronted her, she admitted it and it was a more open conversation. Thing is, if she went to the gym she could still eat *some* of that stuff in moderation. She needs to find the willpower herself as you said OP, coz if you're pushing her and dragging her along in it, it just won't work.\n\nChange needs to come from within. Try a different approach, start a conversation and ask questions instead of giving suggestions or answers, let her come to the answers herself, even if it takes more time. \n\n\"What meals do you think would work for you?\", \"What foods do you want to leave out or what will be your treats/cheats\", \"have you calculated the calories and portion sizes, is that enough to satisfy you?\".  If it takes her weeks or even months but comes around to the same conclusions you do, it's better than being \"told what to do\" or \"what's best\". She needs to find motivation and a system she can manage so she feels empowered. No dig at OP, but a system handed to her where he does all the effort, people take for granted if they don't work on it themselves*sometimes*. Different people learn in different ways, she may need a different approach. \n\nPersonally, I had to look at not just the foods i ate, but the money I spent to really open my eyes on my own journey. How much I was spending, where I spent my money, on what. And then it was easy to see I bought stuff daily (or near daily) and spent a lot I didn't need to. I tracked what I ate and spent and reduced much more successfully and the money saved I made sure to put aside and it paid for my next vacation as a bonus. The goal was lose weight, the bonus was better finances. \n\nNTA OP\n\nBasic knowledge of weight loss, eat less, move more = goals. There is no big secret.", "He has said it's specifically been in the last 8 months (they've been together over a year) and they got engaged at that time.", "I think if you can find the right combination of therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy is awesome) and willpowerin sure you'll do well! I have the cards stacked against me with metabolic issues, hormone issues, generic predisposition to weight gain, and high stress work and home life. I would succeed for a while then everything would fall apart.\n\nHaving a great support netowkrnis also important and my spouse is supportive of the *idea* of me being healthy but not *doing* it with me so I end up feeling like I can't do it alone. It was my third dance with sugars and my endo was like alright lets try this.", "Oh gosh, claw machines are definitely gambling. It's a gambling addiction. They're programmed to only allow one win ever x number of plays, like a slot machine. They're a colorful slot machine aimed at kids. The claw may be loose, but it's just straight up programming. They come with manuals for the owners to set exactly how much money they make between wins. :(\n\nCongrats on your vigilance though that's awesome. Food was mt big addiction and I can fall into a micro transaction hole if I'm not careful. I am usually pretty careful with my money though and generally do well.\n\nI can fully empathize with your description of *why* you sought help. That's the feeling exactly. No release, no way to let it out, and feeling like there's nothing I can do. I've managed to get it under control in recent years, but it took *years*. Over half my life. Good job not getting yourself into that, truly.\n\nI hope you manage to ger yourself a claw machine so you can safely feed your one vice!", "NTA\n\nLying to you about eating chocolate is a concern though - not because she lacks integrity or is a sh*ty person for lying - it sounds a lot like an unhealthy relationship to food, and maybe a binge eating disorder?\n\nOp, is there anything else going on in her life? Have you noticed anything weird about the way she is talking about herself or food in general? Or how she is reacting to the food you make for her?", "NTA, she's basically put her weight gain in your lap and lied to you all the while you've been spending time and effort to help her!", "NTA, she needs to get her shit together", "Man, I wish I had someone like you in my life to make it *that easy* to get in better shape, with virtually 0 drawbacks!\n\nShe's being lazy, selfish and completely ungrateful, to be honest. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou actually went to a lot of effort looking up a healthy diet for her and cooking for her! That\u2019s really great :)\n\nI would say what would probably help is better communication between you two, especially from her to you. She needs to be comfortable telling you \u201chey I have these cravings for Nutella late at night, what do I do\u201d. Probably right now she feels ashamed and embarrassed to tell you such things, but if she tells you then you can both possibly tackle these challenges successfully together.", "NTA.\n\nShe asked for your help.\n\nOne thing, it wouldn't be bad if she checked her hormones. I suffer from PCOS and hypothyroidism for years and had no idea until recently. There's a small chance that, even if it's a 0,000001% chance, those could be in the picture.", "\nPo", "NTA. As an overweight person o get how embarrassed  and frustrated Inwould feel of o were here. \n\nYou're still not an Ah. Her guilt is in her.", "NTA - She lied to your face and only got upset once you found the wrappers.", "How is it too restrictive? The only thing he cuts out entirely is sugar soda and even allows diet sodas in moderation. This isn't even a diet.", "I think my biggest issue with it is that growing up, no one programmed their claws like that. So it really did only matter how well you aimed the claw and accounted for a heavy head or something. At least not in my area which could make a difference since I\u2019m from a rural area. It wasn\u2019t until my preteen years that they started fixing the rates. At first it wasn\u2019t as bad. Now they\u2019re unplayable. But having a time in my memory where they weren\u2019t fixed at least not badly, I think fed into allowing it to become an actual problem. But in the who knows what actually did it. And thank you for the well wishes for my future claw. Finally I\u2019ll have somewhere to put the old ones I won and have in my attic \ud83d\ude05"]}
