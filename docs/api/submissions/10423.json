Furthermore my BMI was really high and he said I would be increasing my risk of cardiovascular disease. Then for two years I worked-out basically 5 days a week, till I got into shape.\n\nIt was during my weight-loss journey that I met my girlfriend (f26), at the gym actually, and we went out for dates and we quickly got into relationship. After we got into a relationship however, things changed. I continued to work on myself and I got into pretty good shape. By contrast, my girlfriend completely halted. She used to be a rock-climber and she completely stopped that. Now her physical activity has basically come to a halt.\n\nNow in the beginning I said nothing, as you don't have to be hyper fit to be healthy and, in the beginning, it was fine. But then things kept getting worse. Eventually she goes to the doctor and he tells her that she has to do something about her weight. During this period, I pushed her to go to the gym but she just didn't make the effort.\n\nThe problem didn't really arise from with this however. The problem came when she asked me to help her eat healthier so she could get her weight under control. As a result, I started making her healthy meals and I tried to make them as tasty as possible. Please note, this took up a lot of time. I tried new recipes and different things to try and make this as easy as I could for her. Before this I would just make chicken in these batches and pop it into the air-fryer before eating (but she ofc didn't like to eat that).\n\nDespite this and pushing her to go to the gym, she told me, the night before last night, that she wasn't losing weight. She promised to me that she hadn't eaten anything extra and that she was going to the gym more frequently.\n\nThen, last night, while looking for my PS5 controller I opened a side-drawer in the loft only to find wrappers and new chocolates. I took it all to her and after she confessed. She told me she had been eating sweets the entire time and would eat from outside when she was at work. At this point, I just get frustrated and exhausted by this and tell her, she needed to go to the gym.\n\nShe started crying and telling me I am fat-shaming her. Now I know how hard losing weight can be but she isn't even trying. She's literally eating jars of Nutella behind my back. I tell her I can't help her, if she can't help herself.\n\nEdit: Now i don't think I am an ass and while most of my friends don't either, some have said that I am fat-shaming her and being an asshole.

After a hard crying while being barely able to walk for a couple of minutes, I figured I\u2019m sick of it and got my act together.

Gonna give you a NTA purely for that reason.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't say anything wrong because she is the only one that can change her behaviour.

Maybe she\u2019s stressed out about life issues and binging. \n\nGoing forward, don\u2019t cook for her. What you did was very kind and supportive. As someone trying to lose weight and is snacky, I know it takes a ton of effort to cook healthy and tasty and she doesn\u2019t care enough to follow up on her end of the weight loss journey.

Encouraging her to go to therapy might be more helpful at this juncture than encouraging her to go to the gym.", "ESH, but a gentle one for both of you. Her sneaking chocolate behind your back plus the change in her activity level sounds like there might be some kind of depression and/or disordered eating on her part, which requires more help than just being told to go to the gym. She also might be anxious that you like her less because of her change in exercise and might be reading that into other things you do unintentionally which might be how she arrived at thinking you\u2019re fat-shaming. It sounds like she\u2019s dealing with some tough emotions. That said, she should have been more honest.\n\nYou sound like you really want to help her and it\u2019s great that you are cooking for her. But if going to the gym and having healthy meals isn\u2019t working for her, it sounds like she needs compassion and not pressure. You don\u2019t seem to be asking her why she felt the need to hide her snacking from you, or interrogating why she stopped working out as much. Maybe start there and ask her to talk to you about why she\u2019s struggling. \n\nAlso bear in mind that a lot of doctors are very fatphobic and make people feel terrible about their bodies because they don\u2019t know how to treat heavier people, not because those people are truly unhealthy.", "She\u2019s just being lazy. You\u2019re not wrong and you did your best to be supportive. If this continues, maybe you should consider leaving her. Her attitude can be detrimental to your own goals and you shouldn\u2019t let her drag you down like this especially when it comes to your health.", "NTA jars of Nutella is not just a few chocolates that\u2019s a lot but you do need to help her more besides the diet part", "Edit- changing to ESH, as some comments below make some valid points. I'm wondering if she truly wants to get into shape or if she is just doing it out of guilt for you because you mentioned it in the past. Until she is ready to get back into shape, no shaming, nagging, or ultimatums will ever work. You can offer to take a walk with her and keep cooking healthy, but until she has that desire, nothing you do will help.", "[deleted]", "YTA.

Hey remember how much you used to love rock climbing? I\u2019ve been wanting to learn - will you teach me? Hey you\u2019re doing great - its ok to splurge and cheat sometimes. Healthier to allow cheats than to never build in any fun in the diet. Let\u2019s work together on a plan we   can both follow with built in treats for our sweet tooth!  Those would be so much less toxic than making her feel worse about her body. \n\nAlso fyi - that age os around the time that a lot of autoimmune disorders and other medical problems start to manifest and it\u2019s possible that the inability to lose weight is tied to thyroid issues, autoimmune disorders, stress and depression, genetics, or any number of things that it doesn\u2019t sound like her doctor tested her for.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This whole time they were doing OP\u2019s approach, which was focus only on weight loss and her physical appearance and neglect her mental health. So of course he didn\u2019t account for her binge eating, because he chose to ignore her emotional needs. OP needs to step back and just play a passive supporting role.

I know exactly how bad your day to say is at work that is such a sacrifice and I\u2019m really not being sarcastic here. That was probably your barely free three hour window and you spent it trying to help your partner. I think you are absolutely not an asshole but as someone who has her entire life struggled with impulsive eating there\u2019s something going on with your girlfriend emotionally and mentally that is making her refuse self care. At its core, to gain a ton of weight in an unhealthy way (vs someone who maybe is in recovery for ED) is almost always (in my life experience) a cry for help BECAUSE it requires you to basically no longer care for your health and well-being. That kind of shift in someone who previously did care can be emotionally debilitating. When I would binge I struggled to stop so much so I would actually make myself sick from eating and still be unable to stop the pattern over the course of days. Surprise I was working the spac bubble at the time and was desperately struggling with emotional regulation of my negative feelings \u2014 as well the job totally robbed me of any self worth during that time contributing to my need to binge for dopamine. Impulsive shopping impulsive eating impulsive everything \u2014 I also got diagnosed with ADHD which has helped a lot.\n\nThe best advice is going to be for you to genuinely sit down and try to connect with her emotionally. I wouldn\u2019t apologize but I would try to make amends by hearing what in her experience has changed. Maybe hunt down a therapist specializing in this stuff. She may take offense to that, but the truth is, she is actively hurting herself and probably wants to stop but doesn\u2019t know how \u2014 so it\u2019s easier to keep hurting herself. It take a lot of change internally to overcome eating disorders (which she now has) or addiction. I encourage you to see this weight gain as disordered eating patterns and maybe to understand when she was also in shape maybe she was also struggling with disordered eating in the opposite way (restricting to achieve her ideal). You obviously love your partner, so now it\u2019s literally time to dig in \u2014 through thick or thin as they say. Good luck! You can do it!

It probably started small, and it\u2019s now spiraled out of control. Seasoning and sauces on your main dishes can also help with some of these cravings (for example, one of my favorite meals to cook is duck a l'orange, and the recipe I learned from Hello Fresh is easy to make).\n\nI said this in another comment, but I really like Abbey Sharp on YouTube. She\u2019s a dietician who often discusses disordered eating in her videos.

Since she\u2019s a dietician, she also has reliable information; that said, it still doesn\u2019t compare to seeing a dietician yourself. I really like her recipe ideas, and she simply seems to have a healthy relationship with food (I can\u2019t remember for sure, but she may have suffered from disordered herself at some point\u2026if not, she is clearly very educated in this area and cares about it a lot).\n\nI also said elsewhere that her mental health is likely a huge factor in all of this. If so, that\u2019s something where she will need to actively participate with her doctors. Therapy, individual and couples, is always a good idea - even when there are no problems - but she likely needs to be seen by, at least, her GP and a psychiatrist to rule out any medical component.

I can\u2019t say things will be easy, but I do believe it will be worth it :)\n\nEdit: I\u2019d like to add that my personal belief is that a healthy relationship with food is way more important than going to the gym more. I don\u2019t think you can outrun a bad diet. I would focus on healthy and *satisfying* meals (what is satisfying to her is probably different that what is satisfying to you, so you need her to help you with choosing meal options\u2026don\u2019t just cook for her and expect her to like it).

You proved to her that she was worthy of love, with or without the gym.\n\nBut that\u2019s not your motivation. You were on track to die if you didn\u2019t get fit, and that\u2019s terrifying. It\u2019s enough for anyone to get themselves into shape. The threat of you losing your fitness is an early grave and that fear will never leave you. That is an absolutely terrifying thing to confront on your own.\n\nYou probably wanted to tackle this issue together, or at the very least, can see a danger that she doesn\u2019t see. But you pushed too far and she now thinks you won\u2019t love her if she doesn\u2019t meet this expectation by the wedding. \n\nAnxiety is a selfish emotion, because it implies that the world\u2019s problems are your fault. It\u2019s introspection beyond what is considered useful. If something bad has happened, or you are sad or angry, anxiety says it\u2019s your fault. Cold facts mean nothing because it\u2019s irrational. They don\u2019t resolve, because they stem from an emotional place, not a logical one. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have your motivation, and she isn\u2019t able to be aware of why you want her support. She only sees her own weight gain and how it\u2019s a problem for you. She probably also feels betrayed in the same way you do, for not telling her that your love was reliant on her weight. If it wasn\u2019t, why does it suddenly matter?\n\nNone that is true, but it\u2019s what stress and anxiety does to somebody. The anxiety isn\u2019t letting her see past herself. So here\u2019s how you fix it. \n\n1. You gotta be vulnerable with her, and tell her WHY it\u2019s so important for YOU to go to the gym, and how much you need her support to handle the pressure. You need her to understand that YOU need her help, not that you need HER to change. Let the fear in for half a second, so that she can be the one to help. \n\n2. You gotta remind her that your support is always there. That the wedding will go on and that she\u2019s gonna look beautiful regardless of how she spends her time.  You need to remind her that she will always, forever and always, be the person you wanted to marry.\n\n3. Finally, you should reassess yourself and see if you are putting the stress of your fears on her shoulders. Have you successfully averted your health issues already? Can you lay off the pedal, and meet her at a level that she\u2019s comfortable at?", "Except\u2026it\u2019s not the whole story. And if you come at your patients with a piece of the puzzle without asking about what\u2019s changed, you can cause significant harm.  If I had gained 50 pounds, sure. I gained I think 10. It wasn\u2019t a huge deal, and if she had asked rather than just made assumptions that I was lazy, she would have realized that I was losing my mind - my other doctor upped my anti-depressants because I was having such vivid dreams that shouldn\u2019t have been a thing based on the meds I was on. \n\nI\u2019ve since lost the weight? How? Definitely didn\u2019t change anything about my lifestyle or eating habits. I got a workout routine back and my stress dropped a bit.", "The doctor I saw once a year got really upset with me about 10 pounds. The doctor I see once every 6 months wasn\u2019t worried and has never been worried about my weight. I am not obese, I am a reasonably active person. But losing your normal workout routine while dealing with far higher than normal stress on MULTIPLE fronts is going to cause havoc. \n\nWeight is a piece of the puzzle, it\u2019s not the whole story. The whole story also involves lifestyle, stress, etc.", "eh people put on weight in a relationship because they might be slightly less active and eating out more with their partner. You'd maybe gain like 10-15 lbs. But it sounds like she swung pretty dramatically between in-shape and active to overeating and hiding her eating habits. That isn't typical relationship gain.", "Relationship belly happens when you eat out more and have more food like wine and dessert because you're out on dates, so you gain some weight. \n\nOP's gf is secretly eating large amounts of sweets while appearing to want to lose weight. That's an eating disorder. A person who liked being physical stopped going to the gym and now they're secretly eating sweets, *that's a psychological problem*. \n\nSomething happened, OP. Therapy would be a lot more helpful than the gym. NTA, but, let her know that you won't be putting in effort like you have been for her weight loss journey. That you're happy to be a gym buddy, and she can eat what you eat, but you're not going to go out of your way because you feel betrayed by the lies. Maybe point out that secretly eating is a big classic redflag for eating disorders, and that you support her *emotional* journey while she figures out what is going on with herself. \n\nTotal shot in the dark, based purely on the timelines and as an internet stranger who obviously knows nothing about these people or their innermost thoughts, it *sounds* like she doesn't believe she's worthy of love and she's self-sabotaging.", "Yeah! \n\nikr", "No.\n\nAlso can we just for once stop diagnosing underlying psychological problems.\n\nOne study below as reference, theres multiple\n\n[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/oby.2009.97](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/oby.2009.97)"]}
