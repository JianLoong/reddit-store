Furthermore my BMI was really high and he said I would be increasing my risk of cardiovascular disease. Then for two years I worked-out basically 5 days a week, till I got into shape.\n\nIt was during my weight-loss journey that I met my girlfriend (f26), at the gym actually, and we went out for dates and we quickly got into relationship. After we got into a relationship however, things changed. I continued to work on myself and I got into pretty good shape. By contrast, my girlfriend completely halted. She used to be a rock-climber and she completely stopped that. Now her physical activity has basically come to a halt.\n\nNow in the beginning I said nothing, as you don't have to be hyper fit to be healthy and, in the beginning, it was fine. But then things kept getting worse. Eventually she goes to the doctor and he tells her that she has to do something about her weight. During this period, I pushed her to go to the gym but she just didn't make the effort.\n\nThe problem didn't really arise from with this however. The problem came when she asked me to help her eat healthier so she could get her weight under control. As a result, I started making her healthy meals and I tried to make them as tasty as possible. Please note, this took up a lot of time. I tried new recipes and different things to try and make this as easy as I could for her. Before this I would just make chicken in these batches and pop it into the air-fryer before eating (but she ofc didn't like to eat that).\n\nDespite this and pushing her to go to the gym, she told me, the night before last night, that she wasn't losing weight. She promised to me that she hadn't eaten anything extra and that she was going to the gym more frequently.\n\nThen, last night, while looking for my PS5 controller I opened a side-drawer in the loft only to find wrappers and new chocolates. I took it all to her and after she confessed. She told me she had been eating sweets the entire time and would eat from outside when she was at work. At this point, I just get frustrated and exhausted by this and tell her, she needed to go to the gym.\n\nShe started crying and telling me I am fat-shaming her. Now I know how hard losing weight can be but she isn't even trying. She's literally eating jars of Nutella behind my back. I tell her I can't help her, if she can't help herself.\n\nEdit: Now i don't think I am an ass and while most of my friends don't either, some have said that I am fat-shaming her and being an asshole.

You've,  patiently, been there for her.   The DOCTOR told her she had to do loose weight.  Self hate is a real thing.  She needs therapy to find out why she's struggling with this.\n\nI have been through insane trauma lately and I've lost all self control with food.  It's only made me hate myself more that's lead to a loss of interest in other important things.\n\nLying MATTERS.   She manipulated you when she accused you of that.  It's deflection away from her food sickness. \n\nMy husband went to the gym today to renew gym membership.  He knows that I'll make excuses if he hadn't done that.  It's a gift of love!

What happened to her?\n\nDid she get hurt?\n\nWas there a trauma that triggered an eating disorder? (Binge eating is also an eating disorder.)

When I was slowly gaining weight I asked my boyfriend if he could keep me accountable, and he did, but I was binging food behind his back and kept gaining until I reached 200lbs. Not once did I ever blame it on him, he tried everything, making sure I had enough fruit (I had a bad sweet tooth so we tried to kind of replace it with fruits then slowly cut a lot of the sugar I was eating out, which was a lot believe me) but I still went and got pastries and stuff. After a hard crying while being barely able to walk for a couple of minutes, I figured I\u2019m sick of it and got my act together.

She knows she has a problem, or she wouldn't have tried to hide it. It sounds like she is using food for something other than nutrition.\n\nAlso, I think you overvalue the gym. There are other places to exercise if gym isn't working for her. When I worked at a sports centre, we used to make fun of people who paid to use gym equipment. We got paid to move heavy things, and they paid money to do almost identical movements.", "NTA- you did a lot of labor in order to help her.

Even the doctor told her to do something about jt and she got worse on purpose.", "Reading this made me remember I had chocolate in my purse. Gonna give you a NTA purely for that reason.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't say anything wrong because she is the only one that can change her behaviour.  However telling her to go to the gym more probably won't help.  Even if she does go, she'll be more hungry afterwards and probably eat even more jars of nutella.", " NTA. You tried to be supportive at her request and she sabotaged it herself.", " NTA - she was fit and athletic, she definitely understands the concept of a calorie deficit. \n\nThis is a mental health issue and or a self discipline issue, not a diet issue. She is eating secretly, and has completely changed her lifestyle, something is wrong here. Maybe she feels now that she has a boyfriend, she doesn\u2019t have to take care of herself. Maybe she\u2019s stressed out about life issues and binging. \n\nGoing forward, don\u2019t cook for her. What you did was very kind and supportive. As someone trying to lose weight and is snacky, I know it takes a ton of effort to cook healthy and tasty and she doesn\u2019t care enough to follow up on her end of the weight loss journey. You can pass on the recipes to her but make it her responsibility to take care of herself. Invite her to the gym every time you go!", "It sounds like she might be depressed and need support (professional support) for the binge/secret eating. \n\nI can tell you really care and you can\u2019t make a person change unless they\u2019re ready to. Encouraging her to go to therapy might be more helpful at this juncture than encouraging her to go to the gym.", "ESH, but a gentle one for both of you. Her sneaking chocolate behind your back plus the change in her activity level sounds like there might be some kind of depression and/or disordered eating on her part, which requires more help than just being told to go to the gym. She also might be anxious that you like her less because of her change in exercise and might be reading that into other things you do unintentionally which might be how she arrived at thinking you\u2019re fat-shaming. It sounds like she\u2019s dealing with some tough emotions. That said, she should have been more honest.\n\nYou sound like you really want to help her and it\u2019s great that you are cooking for her. But if going to the gym and having healthy meals isn\u2019t working for her, it sounds like she needs compassion and not pressure. You don\u2019t seem to be asking her why she felt the need to hide her snacking from you, or interrogating why she stopped working out as much. Maybe start there and ask her to talk to you about why she\u2019s struggling. \n\nAlso bear in mind that a lot of doctors are very fatphobic and make people feel terrible about their bodies because they don\u2019t know how to treat heavier people, not because those people are truly unhealthy.", "She\u2019s just being lazy. You\u2019re not wrong and you did your best to be supportive. If this continues, maybe you should consider leaving her. Her attitude can be detrimental to your own goals and you shouldn\u2019t let her drag you down like this especially when it comes to your health.", "NTA jars of Nutella is not just a few chocolates that\u2019s a lot but you do need to help her more besides the diet part", "Edit- changing to ESH, as some comments below make some valid points. I'm wondering if she truly wants to get into shape or if she is just doing it out of guilt for you because you mentioned it in the past. Until she is ready to get back into shape, no shaming, nagging, or ultimatums will ever work. You can offer to take a walk with her and keep cooking healthy, but until she has that desire, nothing you do will help.", "As you already know, losing weight is not easy. It's not a decision everybody can take in a blink of an eye...for some people, a th\u00e9rapist and /or a specialist must be involved coz its more something that happen in your head that in your mouth...eating can be a way of finding comfort when things aren't right....abd no matter how healhty you eat or how much you exercise, if you ain't right in your head it won't work....so i guess she is feelinf really low, maybe depressed and went for food to feel better coz she couldn't talk to you....\nSo soft yta for blowing at her instead of comforting her: it eally hurts when you wish to lose weight, whe  you feel fat while you hate it...but can't bring your mind to feel better and to stop rush into food...it's really not that simple as: go to the gym....", "YTA. Us fat people don\u2019t need you tell us we\u2019re fat we no.", "YTA soft...\n\nShe asked for help eating healthier and it sounds like you tried but the chocolate confrontation followed by disappointment and getting frustrated with her was absolutely not going to help her at all.\n\nHealthier way would be to encourage activity together. Hey remember how much you used to love rock climbing? I\u2019ve been wanting to learn - will you teach me? Hey you\u2019re doing great - its ok to splurge and cheat sometimes. Healthier to allow cheats than to never build in any fun in the diet. Let\u2019s work together on a plan we   can both follow with built in treats for our sweet tooth!  Those would be so much less toxic than making her feel worse about her body. \n\nAlso fyi - that age os around the time that a lot of autoimmune disorders and other medical problems start to manifest and it\u2019s possible that the inability to lose weight is tied to thyroid issues, autoimmune disorders, stress and depression, genetics, or any number of things that it doesn\u2019t sound like her doctor tested her for.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I took it all to her and after she confessed. She told me she had been eating sweets the entire time and would eat from outside when she was at work. At this point, I just get frustrated and exhausted by this and tell her, she needed to go to the gym.\n\nYeah, it's frustrating when you're helping someone but they're not working for it. But showing her the wrappers (likely in an accusing fashion) and telling her she needs to go to the gym?\n\nI'm guessing she is hiding the food because he is on her case rather than accepting that she wants a treat sometimes.

Prior to that she was just average weight, if not above average in her health.\n\nThis wasn't just my decision of course (i.e I didn't push this on her), she was actually asking me when we were going to get married, after which I popped the question.\n\nMaybe that has been dwelling on her, the increased responsibilities of marriage. I know we were discussing having children before this, could that be it?", "\"may not\" is not useful anyone can make up random scenarios. He also \"may not\" be Kung Fu legend.

To me it's pretty simple do you want help or not. If she doesn't want help and wants to eat junk and not exercise she should just say that from the start.\n\nShe has no justification for wasting his time and effort with lies.", "It is not OPs responsibility to be her dietitian. You are asking too much of them. And just asking inappropriate questions on reddit.", "He wasn\u2019t forcing anything. She asked for help and she was getting it.

Either way, she first, not being honest about her even wanting to lose weight or not, she is not listening to her doctor, she is wasting OP\u2019s time. He was supportive of her the WHOLE time.

What are you talking about?", "Life changes like that and stressing about planning a wedding could do it yes. Add to that she's now stressing about the weight gain and she could be stuck in a self fulfilling cycle. \n\nMaybe it's time to sit down and talk about her worries and her stress level and how she's feeling. Ultimately we're guessing at what changed for her with the purpose of finding a way to have an empathetic conversation on the topic. Because you have gone above and beyond and tried to be supportive but she wasn't being fully honest. \n\nWith my husband it was similar, he wasn't being fully honest about what he was eating and how much etc - and getting caught just stressed him out more. It has the opposite effect from encouraging him to do better. \n\nHopefully you'll be able to find a way to motivate her to change course. You CAN be larger AND healthy(ish) but not if she's stopped all prior activity. \n\nDefinitely be understanding and loving and make sure she knows you're worried she'll have a scare like you did with her health.", "Well, I do know you\u2019re an ass!

She can ask for your help again when she can prove to you that she made progress herself, but till then you will stop the extra effort and only concentrating on your health. \n\nYou can't help someone who doesn't want to change. You will be the bad guy who \"doesn't love her for her personality\" and is fat shaming her.

I've been in her place, unfortunately, and it took me a long time to change my food habits. \n\nI will say that your intake will be different than what her body will need, especially when she is menstruating. As long as you understand that what works for you will not also work for her, then I think you're on the right track. However, while you're within your right to be upset with her, I can only imagine that the comment about her needing to go to the gym will only push her to be more secretive with her indulgence. going to the gym won't fix her issue: changing her eating habits will. cold-cutting these things doesn't work for everyone and can condition people to be more inclined to tuck them away and indulge their cravings secretly. this is especially the case if you've actively barred sweets from being in your cupboards, which you're also within your right to do. it's just that she might not be ready to be ready to make that drastic of a change for herself yet.\n\nif you're willing to, I would try to open up a conversation with her about potentially seeing a therapist that specializes in ED's or just simply asking her where these cravings stem from, and why she feels like she has to be secretive. maybe try to find healthier alternatives of her favourite snacks and incorporate these sweets in small doses; for example, maybe dedicate a day of the week where you both make a desert that you both like (like a cheat meal I guess). if you can give her a safe space to talk about her insecurities and experiences regarding food and exercise, that would probably be really helpful for her.\n\nI hope your girlfriend is able to repair her relationship with food and that everything goes well for you both. \u2764\ufe0f", "YTA\n\nAs soon as she started gaining weight you pushed her to go back to the gym.

All your partner hears is that you think she is fat, ugly, and lazy. \n\nShe lied to you about sticking to her healthy meals, why do you think that is? Is it because she doesn\u2019t feel she can trust you with her struggles? You met her when she was smaller, she is worried your love is conditional to her size. Please take a step back from being her fitness coach and just be her partner. Comfort her. Support her. Encourage her. But please, for the love of god, stop telling her to go to the gym.

A big mistake people make when \u201cgoing healthy\u201d is not building in a slow shift towards healthy and not building in cheats at all. They do it too fast and end up with withdrawal migraines, and feel miserable which encourages cheating on the diet and perpetuates even less healthy eating instead of taking away 1 thing at a time and replacing it with a healthier option.\n\nAnother thing is that all bodies are different and need different things and most conventional \u201cdiets\u201d are not sustainable long term changes toward healthier living at all, and none of them are one plan fits all.\n\nI spent AGES miserable physically doing everything right and it turned out that I was very allergic to the oatmeal I was force feeding myself for \u201chealthy breakfast\u201d every day.

The science behind diet and weight loss is fuzzy and no one has yet to find a one plan fits all this is the key to losing weight and keeping it off forever while staying healthy plan no matter what the ads say. \n\nFurthermore all bodies have a set regular body weight. No amount of dirt or exercise will change that. You can move it by fractions of a pound per year if you\u2019re willing to be a bit unhealthy to get there but that equilibrium weight sets itself not in youth but 20s-30s.

Make sure you\u2019re both on the same page, and that there is no undue pressure/stress on either of your parts. \n\nLoss of motivation to be active is the symptom, attacking the symptom won\u2019t fix the problem. Work on getting back to basics with communicating, and pull the judgement out of it.
