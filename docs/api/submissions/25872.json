Wow.. YTAx2", "YTA\n\nwhile she is cleaning up the food is getting cold.\n\nNormal people eat then do the dishes", "So let's see here... you lose your appetite because you haven't figured out how to *checks notes* turn your back so that you can't see the horrible dirty dishes you just got done using? \n\nAnd you want your wife, who has worked all day, to come home and wash the dishes that you JUST USED, before she can eat?\n\nWhy do you hate your wife so much?\n\nYTA", "WTF rule is \"cooks don't clean\"??\n\nYTA. If you can't eat if the kitchen is messy - and it's messy because of you, then that's a YOU problem.", "How would this work exactly? You've made a delicious hot dinner and then what? You sit and eat while she cleans the kitchen? You both wait for her to clean the kitchen then eat your food cold? I don't understand this. If it's really so intolerable to you, then clean the kitchen as you go and make sure there's never a mess before your dinner is done. YTA", "YTA\n\nThis is a you problem. Either tidy as you go, put things in the sink so they are not visible, or cook dinners with a bake time so she can clean while things are in the oven and not ready yet.", "YTA. So your expectation is that your wife clean up the mess that your cooking made, before she allow herself to eat, because you insist on having a clean space to eat in? I think that's overbearing, if she's holding up her end of the bargain by cleaning after you've cooked, it seems excessive to insist she NOT eat until that is done - wouldn't the food get cold?!\n\nAlso her response is spot on - if you are ultimately so concerned about the mess generated, you should be tidier as you cook so that the mess isn't so bothersome. This doesn't have to mean you're doing ALL the cleaning, it could simply mean things like moving used pots and pans into the sink as you finish with them, etc. \n\nYou can find another place to point your eyes, or get over your hang up.", "YTA.

But that works because I straighten as I cook and the only thing left are the pots and pans and dishes we eat off. While you're eating, those pots/pan can be tucked in the sink. Out of sight, out of mind. \n\nSo not only does she have to do more work, she has to do it on demand like a maid, and because she won't you're doing even less work?

This whole \"cooks don't clean up\" is reaaly not how it works. It seems that the way you have it set up, she cleans up when she cooks **and** when you cook, which is really shitty.\n\nIf you're going to truly split the chores 50-50, you have to do it differently. Just because you wfh, doesn't mean you get a pass on the chores you dislike. There are people who actually like to clean, and that's great for them. The rest of us clean simply because it needs to be done. And _**every**_ cook I know cleans up after themselves.

There's no hint of compromise here and you sound like a moody and controlling ass.", "YTA, I grew up with my mom insisting this and I HATED it.

Sit with your back to the kitchen while you eat and let her enjoy her dinner while it's still hot.

It\u2019s just a best practice. \n\nAlso, I get what you\u2019re saying with the \u201ccooks don\u2019t clean\u201d thing, to an extent. In my house, my mom often cooked, and me, my brother, and my dad would clean up after. But she still did things like throw away scraps while cooking (like garlic peels, etc), putting things in the sink, stuff like that. That\u2019s how I do things now. That way, the kitchen looks nice and presentable while we\u2019re all eating. \n\nNow, my gf and I do things the same way. Sometimes if she\u2019s cooking, I\u2019ll pop the used cutting boards in the dishwasher or do a little background cleaning, and she\u2019ll do the same. It just makes more sense that way.

If OP wants wife to decompress after coming home from work, relax, and enjoy their meals together rather than feel resentment at being told how to complete an assigned task by her own partner...he either needs to get over his aversion to eating while the kitchen is still messy, or tidy it up to a point he's comfortable enough to eat.", "Sit facing a different direction.\n\nBoom, problem solved.", "YTA.

So you get to eat a hot meal while she cleans up your diaster area bc god forbid you know dirty dishes exist.", "That is absolutely nuts and I\u2019m incredibly impressed by your SAINT of a wife\u2019s patience. If my husband did that to me, I would be filing for divorce the next day.", "Info: Why on earth did your wife agree to marry you?", "But the mess is still technically there.....", "Ahhhh so you just want a way to control her. Gotcha.", "This has to be rage bait. No one can really be this UN self aware right?  I hope? OP ate *their* dinner while their partner cleaned the kitchen so he could enjoy his dinner?  And hers got cold?   Do it yourself OP- you're TA \ud83d\udcaf", "Did you seriously just say you want your wife to let her food get cold?", "YOU EAT WITHOUT HER?!?\n\nWhile she cleans up the mess that you made.\n\nI don\u2019t care if your mommy and daddy did it that way.  You\u2019re allegedly an adult. Grow up and be a decent spouse FFS. \n\nYTA", "This is truly terrible. I\u2019m so sad for your wife.", "Do you even like your wife? You are even more of an asshole than I initially thought. Your wife should re-evaluate her entire life with you. I would die on this hill!", ">Pretty much tbh, on the few occasions she has done as I asked I have eaten whilst she cleaned\n\nThis makes you an even bigger AH. Hands down.", "So you get warm food and she gets cold food. YTA.", "Jesus Christ so you just sit there, eating a hot meal and watching your wife clean. YTA", "INFO: how does it work when she cooks? Do you clean while she eats? Are you ok with your food going cold while she sits and eats in front of you?", "Then tidy as you go.", "Stop making excuses.  This is your problem not hers.  YTA", "This is a you problem then. Guess it is time to change the rules. Alternate days and one person does the cooking and cleaning", "You seem to have a lot of very particular demands that you think your wife is obligated to coddle, as if you were the boss and she the employee. YTA.", "A lot of \"me, me, me\"", "If your kitchen is tiny, it should be even easier to clean as you go.", "My kitchen space is tiny. You rectify this by cleaning as you go", "You get worse with every comment you make.  You should be thankful for your wife instead of treating her like a second-class citizen.  She is your partner..", "My kitchen is tiny too. Do you know how I keep it from being a distracting mess? I put things away when I\u2019m done with them, and I at least move used dishes to the sink (I wash them if I\u2019m in a waiting phase). \n\nBut even more to the point, I love my partner and don\u2019t make him clean up the mess I made by being totally incompetent and rule-bound while his food gets cold because I\u2019m bothered by an unusual level of mess in the kitchen.", ">Our kitchen space is tiny and I don\u2019t like her being in my space whilst I cook\n\nI wish I could downvote this comment more... OP - learn to clean up after yourself. The cook should be cleaning - maybe if you cleaned your own mess you wouldn't leave a messy kitchen", "Gordon Ramsay probably cleans as he goes when he's cooking at home.", "Can you imagine sitting down to eat a hot meal and demand your spouse clean the kitchen before they can eat? My husband would look at me like I was nuts, throw his plate of food in the garbage and go out to eat.", "I agree. I'm just wondering why he still looks at the kitchen while eating if it grosses him out so much lol", "It just felt more like a dick move than being an asshole.", "IKR.  Every response makes him a bigger AH LOL", "Ugh. I didn't think of that. OP is a D.", "Good point.", "Wrong is 100% too strong and I felt it as I said it. Definitely there is no wrong way. But in this case, the system isn't working.\n\nThank you for the call out.", ">Because cleaning up after himself is woman's work - woman's work which must be done before she is allowed her daily rations.  /s", "He's definitely not Gordon Ramsey. Ramsey hates lazy, messy cooks.", "Gordon Ramsay would clean as he went.", "We had that rule too, but we still cleaned as we cooked because it's more sanitary and doesn't affect the cooking time.", "\"Because women eat AFTER men - and only when their chores are done.\" /s", "Because he\u2019s the MAN, goddamnit, and little wifey needs to learn her place! /s \n\nTo OP: you keep not answering the most important question: why do you hate your wife? Because you do.", "!!!!!! This right here", "Guess he\u2019s able to eat when she\u2019s scrubbing away at the sink before she\u2019s allowed to eat her sad, cold meal. OP probably thinks it\u2019s dinner theater", "Because he can savor his meal as he enjoys the show of his wife slaving away.", "I have a feeling he enjoys it.  He\u2019s certainly created enough arbitrary rules that he makes it go that way as often as he can.", "Honestly I bet he makes Kraft macaroni and takes out every utensil possible and calls it cooking and makes them dirty when it\u2019s unnecessary. He\u2019s giving me those vibes.\n\nOr goes to make a salad and uses all the mixing bowls and every knife.", "My husband is like this. I asked him to cook eggs and all the mixing bowls, frying pans, cooking utensils were used. It\u2019s weaponized incompetence.", "I highly recommend a new system. The system we use is \"you clean the dishes you use when cooking\". Now I only clean the dishes I make when I cook and the dishes we eat with when I don't.", "I feel like this is the spirit of \u201cthe cook doesn\u2019t do  the dishes\u201d thing\u2026.but it gets twisted by people like OP who want it to mean the cook shouldn\u2019t lower themselves to clean a single dish from start to finish. Washing the dishes you collectively eat out of and serve yourselves from \u2018should\u2019 be the non-cooks responsibility, but the dishes used to prep and cook the meal fall under cooking. \n\nWhy should it be my responsibility to round up and wash 6 separate chopping knives when 1 rinsed between uses would have been perfectly fine? If you want to use 5 ramekins to keep things separate instead of premixing, again, I\u2019m not washing all those bowls, that\u2019s up to you as the cook. If you put raw meat on a plate to pat dry, PUT IT IN THE DISHWASHER! (Or wash it while the meat cooks)."]}
