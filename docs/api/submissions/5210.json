Interesting that a walk in the brisk mountain air didn't clear his head to any degree. You'd probably be better off not repeating this type of event. I hope he doesn't get back to the US and decide he can now drink.

You and S didn\u2019t do anything wrong; you legally had some beers while on holiday, pretty typical stuff.
