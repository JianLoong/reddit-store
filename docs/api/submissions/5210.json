Did you inform his parents where you were going?\n\nI'm leaning n t a or n a h because in most of the world 17 is fine to have a drink or two.  But it kind of depends on how many the kid had and if he has drank before?\n\nThe way I see it the 17 year old could have gone drinking on his own in your country and therefore it's more responsible for them to have been with you, an adult who likely would have cut them off if they had too many.", "A soft YTA. I get he's legal where you are, but because he's *from* somewhere where it's not, that means it would have been best to check with your uncle and his wife before making this kind of decision. Just because something is legal doesn't make it responsible.", "NTA - This is one of those cultural difference problems that Americans will get offended over. However that's fine, they aren't in America haha.", "YTA. Your aunt and uncle were responsible for him, did you even let them know where you were going?  And if you were impaired not much of a guardian for him. 17 is not an adult", "NTA. It\u2019s legal where you are and he could have gone off on his own and got a drink", "NTA from what little info we have it sounds like the only one with an issue is your aunt (IDK why your refer to your aunt as uncle's wife? Maybe culture thing.).\n\nSaw in the comments that he's allowed to drink at home. If dad let's him drink occasionally, then there's no problem here.", "NTA but then again I'm European and used to the lower drinking ages here. I feel it's up to topurists to educate themselves, just as I check the local laws before travelling abroad. Having said that, I strongly advise taking US American boys to any beaches as they will embarrass you with their reaction to topless swimmers/sunbathers.", "NTA in terms of the legal age thing, but if the kid is not used to alcohol, it's no wonder that he was visibly intoxicated when you got back to the house. Interesting that a walk in the brisk mountain air didn't clear his head to any degree. You'd probably be better off not repeating this type of event. I hope he doesn't get back to the US and decide he can now drink. A lot of adults are going to be upset about that.", "In the US, where S is from, he is not legally able to go out drinking for the next four years. You say that he is legally able to hit the bars in whichever European country you're in.\n\nSo no laws broken, but you're an AH for not getting consent to take the kid on a bar crawl.\n\nYTA", "NAH. You and S didn\u2019t do anything wrong; you legally had some beers while on holiday, pretty typical stuff. Even in the US, most states allow minors to drink if they have their parents permission and they\u2019re on a private property. 17 really isn\u2019t a big deal, especially when you consider most countries have drinking ages closer to 16-19; the US is an outlier when it comes to drinking\n\nThat said, they *are* his guardians and he\u2019s *technically* still a minor so I don\u2019t entirely fault them for being upset either even if I don\u2019t agree with it.", "YTA Also grew up in the alps. It's legal and  I would take him out for a beer too, but 3-4 (I assume 0.5l) is to much for someone not used to it. \n\nEven if he drank before, American beer has normally less alcohol content. Give him Radler/Panasch", "When you and your friends finished skiing, started deciding what to do next, and going drinking was discussed; did you think at all about how your Uncle and Aunt would feel about you getting their 17 yo son soused? Did you think about it, realize they would not like that, then conclude \"Aw heck, the kid will love it, and he's almost legal age here, YOLO\"?\n\nRegardless, you showed some major disrespect to your Uncle and Aunt. YTA for that; but you already knew that when you posted here.", "NAH. \n\nI see both sides.  He was legal to drink where you were, but not legal in the US.  Some people have really strong opinions on when people should be able to drink or not (regardless of the legalities).  \n\nI think your issue is coming back drunk.  If you had a couple of drinks with him, fine.  But I'm thinking back to beign in college and having younger cousins.  I wouldn't have gotten them drunk.", "NTA\n\nIts legal there and as the ones whose care he was in for the trip, S's grandparents should have made it clear to him that they didn't want him to drink if that was the case.", "His grandparents don't get a say in whether he drinks or not, they gave up that right when they brought him to a country that allows him to decide.\n\nHowever, given that he is totally inexperienced in regards to alcohol, you do have a responsibility that he doesn't get too wasted. As long as you keep that in mind, you are NTA.", "INFO. Where you driving home drunk?  If so then that\u2019s totally a problem.  I think it would have been better to ask \u201chey are your folks okay if we go out for a drink?\u201d But leaning NTA unless you drove drunk", "NTA If he's old enough", "Mild YTA\n\nI imagine you were well aware that he's not legally allowed to drink at home and that his parents and grandparents wouldn't approve, correct? That's the issue.\n\nIf you had permission from his parents and/or grandparents, that would be different. If he decided on his own to take advantage of the local laws without you, that would be different. As it is though, he was only drinking because he was with you, and he personally isn't normally allowed to drink.", "NAH. If they\u2019re from the states they\u2019re probably going by our drinking age, which is 21. Yours is different, and while it seemed reasonable to you because he\u2019s legal there in your country", "YTA - As others have said, the grandparents were responsible for the kid and you should have gotten their permission before taking him out drinking. Even by European standards a 17 y/o is not an adult and normally requires adult supervision.", "You probably should have checked with the grandparents to make sure it was okay, since he *is* still a minor, but it's reasonable that you, a European living in Europe and all of this taking place in Europe, to have assumed your own cultural norms for the acceptability of going out for alcohol under those circumstances.  At the same time, the grandparents are perfectly reasonable for being concerned over something that *would* have been a problem back home.  But I can't fault you for not having anticipated this would be an issue, since where you live...it isn't.\n\nTherefore, NAH *unless* you had reason (other than American laws you may or may not have known about and that wouldn't apply anyway) to know that the grandparents specifically forbade him from drinking, in which case Y/W/B/T/A.  \n\n(If they only told *him* no and *he* neglected to tell *you*...that's on him.)", "NTA if he is legally old enough. It's his choice whether to drink or not then.", "As the mother of a 17 year old, I would be livid if I entrusted my child to someone and they got him drunk. I don\u2019t give a damn how legal it was. YTA", " Soft YTA\n\nBut you should have asked his guardians permission and you should not have gotten \u201cquite tipsy\u201d and you shouldn\u2019t have bought him enough for him to get \u201cquite tipsy\u201d", "Soft YTA. You prob should've checked because it's not legal where they're from, but they'd be being ridiculous if they didn't forgive you for it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
