So far this week, on Monday I asked her to walk the dog and pick up some medicine for my 12 year old at the shopping center that she was already going to. She did neither. On Tuesday I asked her to walk the dog and take the turkey out of the freezer for dinner. She did neither, and she left the gas stove on for 6 hours.

Not blaming you for putting your foot down now but you need to make it clear to her what you expect and the consequences of it. This needs to be done during a sit down where questions and feedback can be given. Not in the heat of the moment or in the middle of you asking something. You also do need to acknowledge any mental issues she does have and find ways to be able to clearly communicate with her if she's actually struggling with things. You're very angry and dismissive about this..which gives me a bit of concern.\n\nYou should have talked with your husband first about the vacation instead of making that big decision on your own. That's not fair to your partner nor does it convey a United front to your daughter and kids. Talk with him and come up with a plan -- and then talk to your daughter. Some rules and boundaries will do wonders for ALL of you.\n\nIf you don't take her on vacation do not expect her to pet sit. Still follow through with your arrangements like she will be with you.\n\nHaving tasks/chores for all your kids , clearly discussed and written down, would be a good idea. This will be adjustment for your oldest so be patient with her. Remember she's your daughter. She's not an on demand maid or anything like that.\n\n>By the way, this girl doesn't pay for shit.\n\n Nothing you asked for seems unreasonable..but your attitude/tone doesn't make it feel that way.

You're doing the right thing - parenting. Your daughter will have to learn that there are consequences for her actions or, rather lack thereof. \n\nSeveral of my close friends are diagnosed with ADHD and are able to do chores around the house. This is however, only my experience and may not apply to all people with ADHD but having ADHD is not an excuse for having no discipline.", "NTA\n\nShe will facer tougher lessons than a missed vacation with that sense of entitlement.

She essentially has no responsibilities as you guys are taking care of everything so no, she should t be rewarded. \n\nHowever, you created this situation.

You\u2019re piling on more responsibilities when she\u2019s already shown herself to be incapable of managing and clearly struggles with executive function. Don\u2019t set your daughter up to fail.

I am the oldest daughter of three and was an off and on social butterfly, depending on the demands of my life at the time. \n\nWhen I hit 18, I began to run into a lot of issues with follow through, processing emotions, and memory. It became a huge enough issue in my parents eyes that they threatened to pull all support and funding in my life to \u201cforce me to grow up\u201d. They demanded I end my first ever dating relationship because \u201cI was not showing that I was mature enough\u201d, threatened to take my car, and \u201coffered\u201d to have me move back home. In typical teenage fashion-I rebelled. I cut myself off from their monetary support and only saw them on holidays. It absolutely broke me inside that seemingly overnight I went from the golden child of the family to the failure/black sheep\u2026.not because I was making bad decisions or choosing bad behaviors\u2026but because I was struggling to develop the necessary life skills (which comes with its own consequences btw\u2026no need to add more). \n\nInstead of seeing my struggles and offering to take a step back and teach those life skills I was so obviously struggling with, my parents saw me as a lazy, irresponsible kid who \u201cjust needed to grow up\u201d. \n\nAnd grow up I did. The hard way. With only consequences coming from my parents, I turned to an faux-supportive, extremely unhealthy relationship that lasted almost 4 years and only continued to break me. I sought out wisdom from mentors, but did not have the skills I needed to communicate the development I lacked to operate life very easily. It destroyed my relationship with my parents that I felt that I couldn\u2019t be real with them and ask them to support me and teach me the life skills that I was struggling to develop. Instead, when I went to them, I got a lecture and a consequence layered on top of the natural life consequence already in place. I was later diagnosed with ADHD at 24 years old. So many of my skills deficits had been able to be overcompensated for when I was younger\u2026 But that doesn\u2019t last forever. I was able to see a therapist who helped me tremendously in recognizing that I was not a bad person or a bad kid like my parents had labeled me as. I just had severe struggles in certain areas that were much easier for other people. Skills such as time management, follow-through, initiating hard tasks, remembering details, and processing emotion. I don\u2019t blame my parents\u2013 I see now that they were not able to see through the lens of my struggle at the time, and did not have the skills to parent me at that stage of life. I\u2019m very thankful for my husband (who struggles with anxiety), who has walked with me through the trenches of the diagnosis, gaining understanding of the diagnosis, and learning the coping skills and mechanisms that I needed to develop and succeed in this life. Yes, it took much longer for me to develop these skills than most others\u2026 But if I had had the diagnosis sooner and a healthy support system, things would\u2019ve been much different.\n\nI wish my parents have been able to see that it wasn\u2019t out of negligence or laziness, or not caring\u2026 But that the issues I was having were symptoms of an underlying problem that I lack the skills to solve on my own. I needed their help in a different way as a young adult\u2026 But I was still a kid. Their kid. Their kid who still needed help with self growth, even at 18. 19. And even 20 years old. \n\nSo yes, your expectations are fair of a typical 20 year old\u2026 But your daughter is not a typical 20 year old. Verified by doctors. She is still human and yes, we are all a bit lazy, especially 20-year-olds who are learning about life. But as someone who has been in similar shoes, I implore you to take a step back and look at things through a different lens for a moment. If you have - great! But if you believe your kid to be a good hearted, hard-working, mostly good kid that is acting out of character all the sudden\u2026 Then maybe she just needs a little extra support as the real world starts to reveal itself to her. And if she doesn\u2019t get it from home\u2026.where is she going to seek it out?", "[removed]", "ESH. She dealing with stimulant withdrawal and seems to be burnt out from her parentified upbringing.

She could also be suffering from depression, when I wasn\u2019t on any meds my depression was pretty bad and it prevented me from seeking help earlier than I did because I was \u2018okay\u2019. I think if she were to actually have a support system she\u2019d be set up for success a lot more than she seems to be now.", "Absolutely! Great to see some empathy on this subreddit. It makes me sick to see so many neurotypicals with the whole \u201cShE NeEdS to GrOw Up\u201d \ud83e\udd2a nonsense. \n\nSounds like she also might be dealing with executive dysfunction", "As much as I hate to say it, ESH. You make really, really good points. However, I think rather than just springing the punishment on her randomly when it sounds like she has a history of being this self-centered, you should have talked to her about it first. Everything you told us, you should have told her. Then you could have said, \"We want to see improvement. You need to pull your weight around here. If you can't pitch in and help drive your younger siblings to/from activities and help out with a few small, basic tasks around the house, then we won't be paying for you to come on the trip. We'll sit down and re-evaluate in two weeks. What questions do you have about our expectations?\" Then, if her behavior continued, she would understand that was the consequence of her behavior.\n\nFor what it's worth, after my siblings and I graduated high school, we were all told that we were welcome to live at home rent free as long as we were either going to school full time or working full time. This business of her only taking 6 credit hours at school and only working 12 hours a week when she is 20 years old is pretty ridiculous. So, perhaps that could also be something you discuss with your daughter at some point (perhaps for next school year?).", "NTA\n\nI have ADHD and Autism. I have to set reminders on my phone and alarms and all kinds of things, but I get things done and stick to a schedule and work full time. I have task lists on boards in each room of the house so I can go through the checklist when cleaning a room. I make paper lists for the week and the day and put them where I will find them (on top of my computer, usually).\n\nYour daughter has no business using her disability as an excuse to not learn how to COPE with it. She won't have you to bail her out forever, and other people will rapidly tired of that, too.", "YTA She's a grown woman and you're doing her no favors by treating her like a child. She's going to stay trash if you continue. It's time she moved out.", "**it's hard for her to do these things because of her ADHD**\n\nYeah, way to bury the lede there, LOL.  Everything you're describing is a symptom of ADHD.  Is she receiving treatment or medication?", "Info: how has your family dealt with an engaged with her ADHD diagnosis?", "NTA. There are plenty of fully functioning ADHD adults. Don\u2019t insult them because your kid is moody, selfish and lazy.", "NTA", "NTA. If she cared about anyone else; she would help out. She doesn\u2019t.", "NTA all of your asks are reasonable and an adult with known and previously treated ADHD should have had the tools to not make those mistakes. However, if she were treated with medication instead of also learning other skills while growing up then her behavior is no surprise to me at all. This was me. Fact is some people cannot function without medication but regardless other skills do help and it sounds like she needs help.\n\nBeing neuro atypical and being depressed looks a lot like what you are describing from the outside and these things likely literally warp her reality either independently or together, depending on what her executive functions struggles are.\n\nShe may think she is doing well because of some arbitrary qualifier like \"I remember my commitment to <thing I liked> but why do I keep forgetting to do <thing that I don't like>  so everyone must be right it's not my untreated ADHD it's just me being lazy\" \n\nShe needs discipline, but more importantly she needs help, she needs empathy, and she needs her parents guidance and wisdom. It's not like we got magical powers when we turned 18, know what I mean?\n\nHelp her to become more productive and less dependent, help her get the tools to function better and healthy coping mechanisms. She will likely never be \"normal\" but she can survive or even thrive just a little extra help from you and your husband.  \n\n\nI wish you all the best of luck!", "For ADHD, the expected action and the consequence have to be over a short time scale. So keep a weekly chart of chores where each corresponds to one privilege. If she doesn\u2019t walk the dog for a week, she loses the phone or the car for a week. You might start on a one day basis and it should not be framed as punishment but rather \u201cwe are paying you for walking the dog by giving you a car. If you would rather not walk the dog, that\u2019s fine but you\u2019ll have to either but your own car or take the bus\u201d Also she needs to see the doctor to see if she needs a med adjustment or to start meds. As a last comment, anxiety is a very common comorbid condition and it\u2019s important to address it too", "\ud83d\ude32 can I DM you about your experience and story more? I'm almost 26 and I feel like I'm reading my own story right now, but with no definitive or positive outlook of an ending yet.", "Okay but none of your experiences are like the daughter's. She got her diagnosis and medication, and home support.", "She is refusing professional support.", "Can you point to the 'parentification' in this post?\n\nPicking up medication at a place you were already going to and picking up your siblings on occasion is *not parentification*, and calling it such just minimizes what people who are actually parentified go through.", "Parentified because she had to pick up the kids once from school? Whut?", "OP said she chose to stop taking medication and going to therapy.", "It\u2019s still not an excuse. OP said she decided to stop taking medication, and she\u2019s dealing with it herself. And that\u2019s her choice, But that doesn\u2019t mean you leave a stove on for hours! \n\nI deal with mine naturally, so it means a lot of post it\u2019s and alarms, and reminders all over the house. It is messy? Yes but it works for me, she just needs to find what works for her, but preferably without causing damage or harm in the process.", "They got her therapy and medication, both of which she decided to stop.", "She was, but OP said she stopped taking her medication.", "OP got her medication, but daughter stopped taking it.", "She's an adult now. She needs to get that help herself, IMO. \n\nAlso, based on comments from OP, it sounds like their daughter was diagnosed AND treated. She was on medication but took herself off in the last year. That part is a \"her\" problem, not a parent problem.", "OP says she is refusing therapy and meds.", "Yes, OP had the daughter assessed and given medication, but daughter stopped taking it.", "You also can\u2019t jump to conclusions that they\u2019re parentifying her. She\u2019s 20 years old and can\u2019t pick up her brothers and sisters from school once? Ummmmm. All the other things are just normal things ppl do for their household living with parents or not.", "Not just on occasion, once. Because the babysitter was sick.", "Thanks for answering.\n\nNTA\u2026 As a sidenote, I still be trying to talk with your daughter, and ask if some thing is going on at the moment that would lead to this extreme behavior for the past week. Ultimately, though, she is responsible for her mental health.", "Medication for ADHD can have awful side effects. I had suicidal ideation while taking one (not before, not after). There are other treatments and her family could be more supportive", "OP said she was asked to pick her siblings up one time because the babysitter called in sick.", ">Funny how her ADHD doesn\u2019t interfere with her social life right? \n\nYeah, wow, it's almost like activities that are enjoyable are easier for an ADHD brain to do since they provide that desperately needed dopamine. So weirdd!", "Yet you think the daughter doesn't owe them something?", "Then she should be looking into that. She isn't.", "Ummm....my point is 100% the opposite. That everyone with adhd is different."]}
