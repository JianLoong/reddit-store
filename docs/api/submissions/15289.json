So far this week, on Monday I asked her to walk the dog and pick up some medicine for my 12 year old at the shopping center that she was already going to. She did neither. On Tuesday I asked her to walk the dog and take the turkey out of the freezer for dinner. She did neither, and she left the gas stove on for 6 hours.

Not blaming you for putting your foot down now but you need to make it clear to her what you expect and the consequences of it. This needs to be done during a sit down where questions and feedback can be given. Not in the heat of the moment or in the middle of you asking something. You also do need to acknowledge any mental issues she does have and find ways to be able to clearly communicate with her if she's actually struggling with things. You're very angry and dismissive about this..which gives me a bit of concern.\n\nYou should have talked with your husband first about the vacation instead of making that big decision on your own. That's not fair to your partner nor does it convey a United front to your daughter and kids. Talk with him and come up with a plan -- and then talk to your daughter. Some rules and boundaries will do wonders for ALL of you.\n\nIf you don't take her on vacation do not expect her to pet sit. Still follow through with your arrangements like she will be with you.\n\nHaving tasks/chores for all your kids , clearly discussed and written down, would be a good idea. This will be adjustment for your oldest so be patient with her. Remember she's your daughter. She's not an on demand maid or anything like that.\n\n>By the way, this girl doesn't pay for shit.\n\n Nothing you asked for seems unreasonable..but your attitude/tone doesn't make it feel that way.

But, I'm curious how long she's been diagnosed with ADHD and if she's receiving treatment.  Do you think it's possible she could be showing you attitude AND need more help with her condition?", "NTA. You're doing the right thing - parenting. Your daughter will have to learn that there are consequences for her actions or, rather lack thereof. \n\nSeveral of my close friends are diagnosed with ADHD and are able to do chores around the house. This is however, only my experience and may not apply to all people with ADHD but having ADHD is not an excuse for having no discipline.", "NTA\n\nShe will facer tougher lessons than a missed vacation with that sense of entitlement.

She essentially has no responsibilities as you guys are taking care of everything so no, she should t be rewarded. \n\nHowever, you created this situation.

You\u2019re piling on more responsibilities when she\u2019s already shown herself to be incapable of managing and clearly struggles with executive function. Don\u2019t set your daughter up to fail.

I am the oldest daughter of three and was an off and on social butterfly, depending on the demands of my life at the time. \n\nWhen I hit 18, I began to run into a lot of issues with follow through, processing emotions, and memory. It became a huge enough issue in my parents eyes that they threatened to pull all support and funding in my life to \u201cforce me to grow up\u201d. They demanded I end my first ever dating relationship because \u201cI was not showing that I was mature enough\u201d, threatened to take my car, and \u201coffered\u201d to have me move back home. In typical teenage fashion-I rebelled. I cut myself off from their monetary support and only saw them on holidays. It absolutely broke me inside that seemingly overnight I went from the golden child of the family to the failure/black sheep\u2026.not because I was making bad decisions or choosing bad behaviors\u2026but because I was struggling to develop the necessary life skills (which comes with its own consequences btw\u2026no need to add more). \n\nInstead of seeing my struggles and offering to take a step back and teach those life skills I was so obviously struggling with, my parents saw me as a lazy, irresponsible kid who \u201cjust needed to grow up\u201d. \n\nAnd grow up I did. The hard way. With only consequences coming from my parents, I turned to an faux-supportive, extremely unhealthy relationship that lasted almost 4 years and only continued to break me. I sought out wisdom from mentors, but did not have the skills I needed to communicate the development I lacked to operate life very easily. It destroyed my relationship with my parents that I felt that I couldn\u2019t be real with them and ask them to support me and teach me the life skills that I was struggling to develop. Instead, when I went to them, I got a lecture and a consequence layered on top of the natural life consequence already in place. I was later diagnosed with ADHD at 24 years old. So many of my skills deficits had been able to be overcompensated for when I was younger\u2026 But that doesn\u2019t last forever. I was able to see a therapist who helped me tremendously in recognizing that I was not a bad person or a bad kid like my parents had labeled me as. I just had severe struggles in certain areas that were much easier for other people. Skills such as time management, follow-through, initiating hard tasks, remembering details, and processing emotion. I don\u2019t blame my parents\u2013 I see now that they were not able to see through the lens of my struggle at the time, and did not have the skills to parent me at that stage of life. I\u2019m very thankful for my husband (who struggles with anxiety), who has walked with me through the trenches of the diagnosis, gaining understanding of the diagnosis, and learning the coping skills and mechanisms that I needed to develop and succeed in this life. Yes, it took much longer for me to develop these skills than most others\u2026 But if I had had the diagnosis sooner and a healthy support system, things would\u2019ve been much different.\n\nI wish my parents have been able to see that it wasn\u2019t out of negligence or laziness, or not caring\u2026 But that the issues I was having were symptoms of an underlying problem that I lack the skills to solve on my own. I needed their help in a different way as a young adult\u2026 But I was still a kid. Their kid. Their kid who still needed help with self growth, even at 18. 19. And even 20 years old. \n\nSo yes, your expectations are fair of a typical 20 year old\u2026 But your daughter is not a typical 20 year old. Verified by doctors. She is still human and yes, we are all a bit lazy, especially 20-year-olds who are learning about life. But as someone who has been in similar shoes, I implore you to take a step back and look at things through a different lens for a moment. If you have - great! But if you believe your kid to be a good hearted, hard-working, mostly good kid that is acting out of character all the sudden\u2026 Then maybe she just needs a little extra support as the real world starts to reveal itself to her. And if she doesn\u2019t get it from home\u2026.where is she going to seek it out?", "[removed]", "ESH. She dealing with stimulant withdrawal and seems to be burnt out from her parentified upbringing.

Congratulations on finally giving her consequences.", "This is the answer. Before leaping to cancelling vacation\u2026 OP needed to stop paying for the phone. Stop supporting incompetence. Stop making it so easy for her to be almost completely unproductive. \n\nAs someone with ADHD\u2026 and experience with lots of people with anxiety\u2026. It\u2019s much more harmful than helpful to set a precedent for much lower expectations. It can very easily cause people to lose self-efficacy and make it feel impossible to get back into a productive state. \n\nMomentum is so, so key, and she\u2019s clearly lost most of hers.", "\u2026.. extremely curious what ADHD med you were on. I have *never* heard of this. Modern ADHD meds generally work *extremely* differently than meds for most other neurological disorders like anxiety or depression, and typically have much less significant side effects (depending on type and dosage of course). And side effects tend to affect appetite and sleep more than anything else. \n\nWhat on earth were you taking?", "As the parent of an adhd kid, I read this and thought \u201cundiagnosed adhd\u201d. Then I got to the end and it\u2019s diagnosed adhd. \n\nWhich makes YTA. This is no way to parent any kid, let alone an adhd kid. I\u2019m ignoring that your daughter is of age, as you are clearly ignoring it and treating her like a child (assigning chores, paying for everything). That\u2019s the first problem. If you want her to be an adult, treat her like one. Not from one day to the next, but gradually and in communication with your daughter. But as I said \u2014 I\u2019m ignoring the age thing and treating this as (actively raising) parent - child interaction. That means: you\u2019re the adult, so act like one. \n\nIf your daughter isn\u2019t paying for anything, that\u2019s on you. You didn\u2019t make her pay, so you can\u2019t just turn around now and accuse her of it. That\u2019s passive aggressive parenting at its worst. \n\nYour daughter has adhd and all of the issues you describe fit a person who has adhd and is not coping well. Whether that\u2019s your fault or your daughter\u2019s is neither here nor there, I\u2019m not going to get into that. What you\u2019re doing is not, I repeat NOT, a strategy that will help someone with adhd to get their life in order. Adhd brains don\u2019t work like that. They need tons of repetition, structure, rules, rewards, and an immediate and predictable link between behavior and consequence. Your daughter needs active support, therapy and possibly meds to manage her life. Canceling her vacation out of the blue is vindictive, not constructive. It won\u2019t solve anything but it sure will drive a wedge between the two of you. \n\nBe the adult and help your daughter get help. I\u2019m NOT advocating that you put up with her day-to-day behavior \u2014 far from it! But you can\u2019t just let everything go (except for complaining/nagging) and then explode, exclude her from the family vacation and threaten to throw her out. That\u2019s not fair and you\u2019re blaming your child for your bad parenting.", "ESH, I think.", "Coming from someone with ADHD, I agree that they have raised a perhaps entitled child who definitely never learned to independently manage her condition. As such, I think OP needs to be supportive in encouraging/helping their child to find a therapist who is knowledgeable about ADHD, and meeting with that therapist regularly to learn, try out, and practice different strategies for managing their ADHD symptoms. Yes, the child is an adult, but is still very young at 20, especially considering they have never lived out of their parents\u2019 house or worked full time. \n\nAs many comments have stated, since the daughter is an adult, it is officially her responsibility to seek treatment for her condition. OP has no legal obligation here. \n\nHOWEVER, younger adults, especially those with health issues, benefit from and deserve parental/familial support (if the family has the ability and capacity) in figuring out how to navigate the healthcare system and successfully manage their medical condition(s).\n\nI say this not just as someone who was technically an adult still trying to figure out how to manage my medical conditions (including ADHD) at age 20. I am also someone who started teaching kids who have ADHD when I was 24, and I remember during that first year of teaching, I was acutely aware of how much more capable, knowledgeable, respnsible, stable, and \u201cgrown up\u201d I was at 24 vs 20. At 29 now, I can say with certainty that I continued to \u201cgrow up\u201d significantly since 24. I wholeheartedly believe that every 30+ year old who says they were fully grown and responsible at age 20 is either lying or does not remember what it was like to be 20 years old.", "Which doesnt have anything to do with the Situation since the daughter actively and willingly stopped taking her meds because in her mind she is handling it well", "I mean. It also depends on comorbidities. I\u2019ve had depression and anxiety for more than half of my life now (both very common comorbidities with ADHD). I\u2019ve tried almost all classes of antidepressants (with the exception of MAOIs and any new releases because I\u2019ve been on the same antidepressant for several years now), and never experienced the suicidal ideation side effect from any of them.\n\nHowever, a year or two ago when I was on [what we later realized was] too high a dose of adderall, I absolutely started feeling suicidal during the adderall crash/comedown. Of course I do have depression, and a history of suicidal thoughts/attenpts in my teens (over a decade ago), but it was the adderall side effects that pushed me into scary territory at that time.", "I\u2019m aware of the comorbidities. I have also had ADHD my whole life, have comorbid anxiety, and know several people who have comorbid depression. \n\nHonest to Jesus, I forget people are even still *prescribed* Adderall for ADHD. I dunno if it\u2019s still a big thing in the US where the name of the game is branding and profit or something rather than efficacy. Where I\u2019m from it\u2019s basically nonexistent. There are so many more appropriate front line treatments for ADHD with much less potential for side effects and much more stable efficacy. ADHD meds shouldn\u2019t *have* a \u201ccrash.\u201d\n\nSo fair enough, I guess you\u2019re right. But I would honestly even go so far as to say doctors who readily prescribe Adderall without first trialling appropriate front line medications for ADHD are being straight up negligent. *Especially* if they\u2019re prescribing a higher-than-minimum dose to begin with. And *especially* if you are on other medications affecting brain activity.", "Ooh I am super curious now, what medications are considered front line treatments for ADHD where you are from?\n\nEdit: Over here, the only ADHD meds I hear about from others are Adderall, Vyvanse, Concerta, Ritalin, and Strattera (sp?).", "First line is generally considered slow-release methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concetta, etc). It has one of the highest efficacies of any psychiatric medication, with the mildest side effects. Especially in children. \n\nIn general, ADHD treatments are stimulants, which are actually known not to interact well with antidepressants.", "Ah. I tried methylphenidate when I was younger but it didn\u2019t work for me. The adderall worked until it started giving me bad side effects. I\u2019m currently in the process of trying to get off of it and manage unmedicated. But it\u2019s a rough road after taking it regularly for years."]}
