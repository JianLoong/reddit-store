Not blaming you for putting your foot down now but you need to make it clear to her what you expect and the consequences of it. This needs to be done during a sit down where questions and feedback can be given. Not in the heat of the moment or in the middle of you asking something. You also do need to acknowledge any mental issues she does have and find ways to be able to clearly communicate with her if she's actually struggling with things. You're very angry and dismissive about this..which gives me a bit of concern.\n\nYou should have talked with your husband first about the vacation instead of making that big decision on your own. That's not fair to your partner nor does it convey a United front to your daughter and kids. Talk with him and come up with a plan -- and then talk to your daughter. Some rules and boundaries will do wonders for ALL of you.\n\nIf you don't take her on vacation do not expect her to pet sit. Still follow through with your arrangements like she will be with you.\n\nHaving tasks/chores for all your kids , clearly discussed and written down, would be a good idea. This will be adjustment for your oldest so be patient with her. Remember she's your daughter. She's not an on demand maid or anything like that.\n\n>By the way, this girl doesn't pay for shit.\n\n Nothing you asked for seems unreasonable..but your attitude/tone doesn't make it feel that way.

But, I'm curious how long she's been diagnosed with ADHD and if she's receiving treatment.  Do you think it's possible she could be showing you attitude AND need more help with her condition?", "NTA. You're doing the right thing - parenting. Your daughter will have to learn that there are consequences for her actions or, rather lack thereof. \n\nSeveral of my close friends are diagnosed with ADHD and are able to do chores around the house. This is however, only my experience and may not apply to all people with ADHD but having ADHD is not an excuse for having no discipline.", "NTA\n\nShe will facer tougher lessons than a missed vacation with that sense of entitlement.

She is a 20 year old woman, and your expectations don't seem out of line for the situation - and ADHD can be a reason, but that doesn't make it an excuse - but if there is more going on, such as depression... is isn't exactly going to help her get out this...", "NTA", "NTA.

She essentially has no responsibilities as you guys are taking care of everything so no, she should t be rewarded. \n\nHowever, you created this situation.

You can\u2019t expect her to change when you\u2019ve both been enabling her behavior. \n\nI think you should start cutting back on what you pay for and contribute to for her.

You\u2019re piling on more responsibilities when she\u2019s already shown herself to be incapable of managing and clearly struggles with executive function. Don\u2019t set your daughter up to fail.

I am the oldest daughter of three and was an off and on social butterfly, depending on the demands of my life at the time. \n\nWhen I hit 18, I began to run into a lot of issues with follow through, processing emotions, and memory. It became a huge enough issue in my parents eyes that they threatened to pull all support and funding in my life to \u201cforce me to grow up\u201d. They demanded I end my first ever dating relationship because \u201cI was not showing that I was mature enough\u201d, threatened to take my car, and \u201coffered\u201d to have me move back home. In typical teenage fashion-I rebelled. I cut myself off from their monetary support and only saw them on holidays. It absolutely broke me inside that seemingly overnight I went from the golden child of the family to the failure/black sheep\u2026.not because I was making bad decisions or choosing bad behaviors\u2026but because I was struggling to develop the necessary life skills (which comes with its own consequences btw\u2026no need to add more). \n\nInstead of seeing my struggles and offering to take a step back and teach those life skills I was so obviously struggling with, my parents saw me as a lazy, irresponsible kid who \u201cjust needed to grow up\u201d. \n\nAnd grow up I did. The hard way. With only consequences coming from my parents, I turned to an faux-supportive, extremely unhealthy relationship that lasted almost 4 years and only continued to break me. I sought out wisdom from mentors, but did not have the skills I needed to communicate the development I lacked to operate life very easily. It destroyed my relationship with my parents that I felt that I couldn\u2019t be real with them and ask them to support me and teach me the life skills that I was struggling to develop. Instead, when I went to them, I got a lecture and a consequence layered on top of the natural life consequence already in place. I was later diagnosed with ADHD at 24 years old. So many of my skills deficits had been able to be overcompensated for when I was younger\u2026 But that doesn\u2019t last forever. I was able to see a therapist who helped me tremendously in recognizing that I was not a bad person or a bad kid like my parents had labeled me as. I just had severe struggles in certain areas that were much easier for other people. Skills such as time management, follow-through, initiating hard tasks, remembering details, and processing emotion. I don\u2019t blame my parents\u2013 I see now that they were not able to see through the lens of my struggle at the time, and did not have the skills to parent me at that stage of life. I\u2019m very thankful for my husband (who struggles with anxiety), who has walked with me through the trenches of the diagnosis, gaining understanding of the diagnosis, and learning the coping skills and mechanisms that I needed to develop and succeed in this life. Yes, it took much longer for me to develop these skills than most others\u2026 But if I had had the diagnosis sooner and a healthy support system, things would\u2019ve been much different.\n\nI wish my parents have been able to see that it wasn\u2019t out of negligence or laziness, or not caring\u2026 But that the issues I was having were symptoms of an underlying problem that I lack the skills to solve on my own. I needed their help in a different way as a young adult\u2026 But I was still a kid. Their kid. Their kid who still needed help with self growth, even at 18. 19. And even 20 years old. \n\nSo yes, your expectations are fair of a typical 20 year old\u2026 But your daughter is not a typical 20 year old. Verified by doctors. She is still human and yes, we are all a bit lazy, especially 20-year-olds who are learning about life. But as someone who has been in similar shoes, I implore you to take a step back and look at things through a different lens for a moment. If you have - great! But if you believe your kid to be a good hearted, hard-working, mostly good kid that is acting out of character all the sudden\u2026 Then maybe she just needs a little extra support as the real world starts to reveal itself to her. And if she doesn\u2019t get it from home\u2026.where is she going to seek it out?", "[removed]", "ESH. She dealing with stimulant withdrawal and seems to be burnt out from her parentified upbringing.

But I would think the daughter\u2019s \u201cdisability\u201d would have caused chronic lateness (or even forgetting to show up at all) or other breach of duties sufficiently serious as to merit termination.", "According to OP it sounds like she stopped taking her meds a year ago so I definitely think her ADHD is mismanaged and maybe her daughter just isn\u2019t seeing the reality of how her symptoms are interfering with her day to day life. She could also be suffering from depression, when I wasn\u2019t on any meds my depression was pretty bad and it prevented me from seeking help earlier than I did because I was \u2018okay\u2019. I think if she were to actually have a support system she\u2019d be set up for success a lot more than she seems to be now.", "Absolutely! Great to see some empathy on this subreddit. It makes me sick to see so many neurotypicals with the whole \u201cShE NeEdS to GrOw Up\u201d \ud83e\udd2a nonsense. \n\nSounds like she also might be dealing with executive dysfunction"]}
