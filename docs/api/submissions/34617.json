Raise your concern, propose switching it up and if he make a big deal of it, you know what to expect. 6 months in you guys should be in the \"good\" phase, so if he is not able to compromise over something so silly as movie to watch now, you might have bigger problem later. Good luck!", "NTA but this is probably a prelude to what life will be with him so you may start thinking about finding a new movie partner.", "This isn\u2019t a silly thing to fight about because his reluctance to let you pick something as small as as what movie you watch together is a microcosm of a much much bigger problem. If he can\u2019t yield on something as petty as the movies or music you enjoy togerher what else is he going to veto you on in the future? Clearly he thinks his opinion and tastes are more important than yours \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f if he\u2019s going to carry this attitude to bigger things like marriage, children, how you\u2019d raise those children, where you will live, the kind of life you\u2019ll live together\u2026 and you\u2019ll just be expected to follow suit and let him decide everything because he won\u2019t even consider what you want, then this is a much bigger problem. \n\nEven if it WAS just about the movies it would still be incredibly annoying. He behaves like a bossy child that always wants to be the one calling the shots on what games everyone will play. NO ONE ever wants to play with that kid for too long because everyone wants to be able to pick a game once in a while. \n\nNTA but seriously consider if he shows other signs of being this selfish, controlling and inconsiderate in other areas of your relationship or even with other people. Because this may be a much bigger problem that doesn\u2019t bode well towards having a healthy long term relationship.", "NTA\n\nI have a friend who does this and I hate it. It\u2019s \u201clet\u2019s watch a movie\u201d but either I can only pick from a handful he picks out OR we scroll through the the list and I\u2019ll keep calling out possibilities that he ignores until I get to one he wants.\n\nDo you really enjoy the things he picks?  Or do you just say you do to keep the peace? \n\nAnd enjoying what he likes doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do something you want for once.  I wouldn\u2019t even be satisfied with 1/25.  I\u2019d be expecting at least close to 50/50.  Because that\u2019s how partnerships work.", "NTA, HOWEVER\n\nyou should tell him you've been really enjoying his recommendations... but there's this film you've been dying to watch. It's about this couple where the guy picks all the films all the time, and then his gf breaks up with him for being a media tyrant.", "\ud83d\udea9", "NTA \n\nAnd I would bet good money that once you get a pick he will pout and/or interrupt through the movie so that you won\u2019t want to pick again. If this happens run like hell.", "I think the best way to make these decisions is a back and forth system. You pick the movie one time, Jake picks the movie the next time.   \nI'd tell them how you feel and if they can't respect that, maybe it's not someone you'd want to be with.", "NTA. Allowing you to choose one movie is an ultimatum to him?!? Does this happen with anything else? Picking a restaurant, etc?", "NTA. Calmly explain to him, since he apparently didn't learn this in kindergarten when he should have, that taking turns is the civil thing to do and that's what needs to happen going forward.\n\nAnd also, despite him being older than you, he is not the boss of you.", "NTA but he's controlling. Break up wuthering him because it won't get better", "NTA.\n\nYou are right, this is an inconsequential argument. However, since it's so inconsequential, he should be willing to give a little as well. Like, you should be able to choose *at least* 1 in every 4 movies, but ideally 50/50. It's indicative of him needing to be in control of everything.\n\nUnsolicited advice: Proceed with caution, this is a red flag. If it persists, probably GTFO.", "NTA obviously it\u2019s reasonable to want to have a fair balance of who chooses what to watch. Does he also choose your food at restaurants?", "NTA, tho if hes that controlling early on, doesnt seem like its working out if you want equal footing.", "NTA.  If you let him win this battle, he'll be picking things all the time in different facets of your life and you'll have no say so.", "NTA. He needs to mature if he wants a long term relationship with you. I for one have learned to sit through Hallmark Xmas marathons to build bonus points to be used up in the next year.", "NTA, my grandpa is like this and throws a hissy fit when we want to watch anything that isn't a ponderous reflection of the human condition \ud83d\ude44 Ask him why your opinions matter so little to him.", "NTA...sounds kinda controlling on your bf's part.  Regardless if y'all enjoy the same movies, ect. it should be a 2 way street.  Sounds to me like he took as though 'my way or the highway'.", "Nta i had an ex like that. But now I'm dating a guy that we both pick a movie together and once in awhile he picks one I am ok with and I pick one he is ok with. But usually in a healthy relationship you watch movies you pick together. But also most of our dates aren't home or if they are we chat over wine and music. Idk netflix and chill is fun but I prefer deep conversations and vibing anyway nta he's being selfish. Use this mantra : if he wanted to, he fuxking would! Make sure you are doing the same. Communication is key", "What\u2019s wrong with just taking turns? Didn\u2019t we all learn about sharing and being considerate of others in kindergarten?", "NTA. This seems like an indication that your boyfriend has a need to control others, and that could be a very bad sign. Regardless of whether you enjoy his picks, I would insist on choosing the movies equally and see how he responds. If he can't handle that, I would have serious concerns about remaining in the relationship long term. When someone shows you who they are, believe them.", "NTA. I'll be honest I don't always (usually) really enjoy the movies most of my GFs pick. But I also realize that I'm usually the one picking things and they probably feel the same way at times. So I'll watch whatever they pick and even pretend that I enjoy it. Because what's the big deal, it's just a movie and it makes her happy. I guess I'm saying that its about respect and compromise. Sometimes we both truly enjoy the movie. Other times it's more for one of us and we just enjoy the time together. I don't see why you're not \"allowed\" to choose them. It's just being considerate of your partner and making them feel like what they like, want, say, etc is important and it should be. He sounds pretty selfish and it seems unfair. Maybe he sees it as something small and not a big deal. Or maybe that's just how he is and if not corrected will progressively get worse", "Obviously NTA. You're dating one though.", "NTA.", "NTA, just form the information provided it sounds like dude thinks you can't pick good stuff.  You should just start hating everything he picks.", "NTA. Does this bleed over into other aspects of the relationship? Choosing restaurants, other activities?", "You know this behavior will bleed over to other aspects of your relationship,  right?  Also,  the lack of respect.  Plus,  the longer you allow it,  the more he will expect it,  the less he will respect you for it.", "NTA nope and I get that, it\u2019s exhausting and hurtful to never get to pick", "NTA- it pretty standard that you flip flop on who gets to chose the movie in relationships. One person will pick, and then the other next time. It's not fair for one person to always get their choice even if the other is enjoying the movies. I'm curious if he is like this in other aspects of your relationship. Does he get to make most of the choices about other things too? Like where you eat, what activities you do? If the answer is yes he sounds controlling...", "NTA in any way shape or form. \n\nThis is a sign of things to come. If he can't compromise & play fair on this, he's likely to be as intransigent on other, bigger things.\n\nTime for a rethink imho.", "NTA\n\nBut lol you gotta let bro pick the movie sometimes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
