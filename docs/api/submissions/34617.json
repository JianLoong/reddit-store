Raise your concern, propose switching it up and if he make a big deal of it, you know what to expect. 6 months in you guys should be in the \"good\" phase, so if he is not able to compromise over something so silly as movie to watch now, you might have bigger problem later. Good luck!", "NTA but this is probably a prelude to what life will be with him so you may start thinking about finding a new movie partner.", "This isn\u2019t a silly thing to fight about because his reluctance to let you pick something as small as as what movie you watch together is a microcosm of a much much bigger problem. If he can\u2019t yield on something as petty as the movies or music you enjoy togerher what else is he going to veto you on in the future?

He behaves like a bossy child that always wants to be the one calling the shots on what games everyone will play. NO ONE ever wants to play with that kid for too long because everyone wants to be able to pick a game once in a while. \n\nNTA but seriously consider if he shows other signs of being this selfish, controlling and inconsiderate in other areas of your relationship or even with other people.

Break up wuthering him because it won't get better", "NTA.\n\nYou are right, this is an inconsequential argument. However, since it's so inconsequential, he should be willing to give a little as well. Like, you should be able to choose *at least* 1 in every 4 movies, but ideally 50/50.

Communication is key", "What\u2019s wrong with just taking turns? Didn\u2019t we all learn about sharing and being considerate of others in kindergarten?", "NTA. This seems like an indication that your boyfriend has a need to control others, and that could be a very bad sign. Regardless of whether you enjoy his picks, I would insist on choosing the movies equally and see how he responds. If he can't handle that, I would have serious concerns about remaining in the relationship long term. When someone shows you who they are, believe them.", "NTA. I'll be honest I don't always (usually) really enjoy the movies most of my GFs pick. But I also realize that I'm usually the one picking things and they probably feel the same way at times. So I'll watch whatever they pick and even pretend that I enjoy it. Because what's the big deal, it's just a movie and it makes her happy. I guess I'm saying that its about respect and compromise. Sometimes we both truly enjoy the movie. Other times it's more for one of us and we just enjoy the time together. I don't see why you're not \"allowed\" to choose them. It's just being considerate of your partner and making them feel like what they like, want, say, etc is important and it should be. He sounds pretty selfish and it seems unfair. Maybe he sees it as something small and not a big deal. Or maybe that's just how he is and if not corrected will progressively get worse", "Obviously NTA.

Plus,  the longer you allow it,  the more he will expect it,  the less he will respect you for it.", "NTA nope and I get that, it\u2019s exhausting and hurtful to never get to pick", "NTA- it pretty standard that you flip flop on who gets to chose the movie in relationships. One person will pick, and then the other next time. It's not fair for one person to always get their choice even if the other is enjoying the movies. I'm curious if he is like this in other aspects of your relationship. Does he get to make most of the choices about other things too? Like where you eat, what activities you do? If the answer is yes he sounds controlling...", "NTA in any way shape or form. \n\nThis is a sign of things to come.
