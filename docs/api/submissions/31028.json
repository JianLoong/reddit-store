You mean for work or because she\u2019s sick?", "NTA you told him the hard truth, he a grown ass adult cant care for himself like one, whats his response? To storm off to his room like a child. Seriously, if he had any maturity he would of reflected  on your words instead of having a tantrum about it. He asked and got answered.", "NTA.
