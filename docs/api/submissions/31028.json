He asked, you answered. If you had thrown the information at him unsolicited then you would be TA. He can be hurt by the information, but you did him a favor if he's sincere about finding and fixing the problem.", "~~I N F O: So he doesn't wash his clothes, cook, do dishes, clean his home, and so on?  How are these things getting done?  You're leaving a lot out.~~\n\nEdit; Thanks for the extra info.\n\nNTA for saying it to him. He asked a direct question, and you gave him a direct answer.  He's 31 and his mommy has to come cook and clean for him.  No one wants a grown child for a life partner.", "Your phrasing may have hurt his feelings but NTA. This is the kind of question you don\u2019t ask unless you\u2019re sure you are completely prepared for an answer you may not like or want to hear.", "NTA he is dooming himself to a life alone. Women will get into a relationship with him then run away when they realize they have a child instead of a mate. \n\nThis guy needs some guidance. When having future conversations or interactions with him, point out things you are doing that women like such as: cooking dinner, Dude women love it when you cook for them. Cleaning, women appreciate a partner who does their part. etc.", "NTA\n\nThe hard truth isn't always pleasant, but it's better for him to know it.", "INFO: Is he exceedingly wealthy? Why hasn\u2019t he learned to do any basic chores and operating basic house appliances? \n\nI\u2019m honestly baffled at the idea of a 30+ year old who only recently learned how to operate a toaster and microwave. So he never heated any food in the microwave by himself all his life??? How is that possible??? And what do you mean some people do the chores for him when his mom is in the hospital? You mean for work or because she\u2019s sick?", "NTA you told him the hard truth, he a grown ass adult cant care for himself like one, whats his response? To storm off to his room like a child. Seriously, if he had any maturity he would of reflected  on your words instead of having a tantrum about it. He asked and got answered.", "NTA. I'm hoping that the toaster thing was an exaggeration, because it's a three-step process. I knew how to do it when I was four.", "NTA - and thanks for the extra info about him still getting his mother to come round and wash his clothes and do his housework. Wow. Guarantee that this guy is on the path to becoming one of those bitter manosphere guys who think feminism has killed romance because no woman wants to be his replacement mother anymore.\n\nMen like this need to hear these facts from friends. You did just fine. He asked, you told him.", "NTA. Just don\u2019t ever mention to him that Sarah or a \u2018romantic interest\u2019 of his has told you this.", "NTA, he asked you for the truth and you told him. A woman he likes is interested in him but not jumping into a relationship with him because of his immaturity. He wanted to know and this is the answer. he's just mad at the truth.", "NTA. \n\nOP stop being friends with fully grown adults who don't know how to do basic household tasks.", "NTA - He asked, you answered. I wouldn\u2019t date a man in his 30s who cannot cook for himself or clean up after himself no matter how smart or sweet he is. Hard pass.", "NTA - no rational person would want to be with someone without basic life skills", "NTA", "NTA but honestly i also feel a little bad for the dude because his parents failed him massively\u2026", "NTA omg this guys normal meter is broken", "YTA - He did ask the question and it was right to be honest, but I do think you could have chosen your words a little more carefully. Also, really you ought to just stay out of it altogether and let them figure it out on their own.", "NTA, but you\u2019re not necessarily correct.

He should be fucking embarrassed by his ineptness.", "NTA That's just sad that he doesn't have any of these life skills nor does it seem like he wants to learn them. I mean if he wanted to, he'd have learned so much more by now. I'd imagine he likes being babied and doesn't want to change, hence why he got angry. He wants two conflicting things: to have the responsibility of a child and to have an adult relationship. He can't have both and someone needed to tell him", "NTA- he asks why you would say something like that when he knows damn well he\u2019s behind on learning to take care of himself and perform adult tasks like cooking and laundry?! You are not an asshole it sounds like he didn\u2019t like the truth being pointed out. Of course Sarah doesn\u2019t want to be his mommy/maid", "NTA... amen sister.

No one gets turned on by their partner having to ask for help in the grocery store, or when they seem to think that the bathroom cleans itself magically. \n\nThere's no excuse for a grown ass man not knowing how to do chores, cleaning, cooking or grocery shopping. And it's not a woman's responsibility to teach him how.", "And then there's the part where he didn't like OP's answer, so he...stormed off and went to his room.\n\nMy son does that sometimes, too, but then again, my son is four.
