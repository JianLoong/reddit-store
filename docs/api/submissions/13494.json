For a little context, I came out to my friend as asexual a few months back and she accepted it, but she told me she wasn\u2019t totally on board on it and not to tell her other friends that, which okay, that\u2019s fine. I have also told her many times I have no desire to date anyone every time she tries to hook me up with someone. But what happened was she invited me to go eat at a restaurant with her, which we do at least once a week, and went and meet her. When I came in she was already there with a guy. I didn\u2019t say anything, just exchanged pleasantries and talked to him a bit to be nice. About twenty minutes in she dropped the bombshell that this was a surprise date and that she was hoping we could go to his house together after the dinner. Not only was I absolutely furious, the poor guy looked completely uncomfortable as well. I made an excuse that I had to go, paid for my dinner, and told the guy it was nice meeting him, and left without telling her anything. I called her later and told her that was completely uncalled for, that I already told her multiple times about my feelings on anything sexual. That I was very uncomfortable throughout everything. She told me I was being a bitch for leaving and that I \u2018needed to grow up and get out of my virgin phase\u2019. And that she had set me up with some one who would sleep me. I told her that I needed time to think about our friendship after that and haven\u2019t contacted her since.

She doesn\u2019t get to dictate your romance or sexuality. OP, time to cut ties with this person, she is not your friend. A \u201cfriend\u201d would hear you say this and respect your wishes, this person doesn\u2019t even see how she was in the wrong. \n\nNTA!", "NTA. Time to dump this friend.", "NTA. Surprise dates are absurd, and a surprise date in response to you telling her you're asexual is just rude. You don't need fixing (up).", "NTA\n\nYour friend sounds like an AH.\n\nBoth for the \"lets get you out of your virgin phase\" comment, and setting you up on a date when you made it clear you're not interested in dating.", "Nta, she doesn't want to accept your choice on sexuality and seems to have made it her mission to try and convince you otherwise. \n\nHonestly seems you'd be better off without them in your life with their response.", "NTA - she is not a friend! No friend would set you up to sleep with someone when you clearly explained your situation and they \u201caccepted\u201d it. \nSorry, but what she did is trashy and you deserve a better friend!! I would block her and just go on with life! Just be you and don\u2019t let anyone force their own way/beliefs on you!", "That's not a friend.\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA.\n\nThis is a person who does not respect your autonomy, and thinks they know you better than you know yourself.", "NTA\n\nI always find it extremely rude and inconsiderate when friends set up 'surprise dates' and other such events. *Especially* with Friend's assumption that you'd be totally cool to go back to a *complete stranger's home* right after the first date.\n\nWell, 'friend' in this case, as her response to you leaving was nothing short of rude and disrespectful.\n\nI don't think you have much to think about in regards to your friendship with her.", "NTA. This person does not respect your sexuality and wants you to keep it a secret in order to not \"embarass\" her, and she does not respect boundaries which you have already clearly stated to her repeatedly regarding your sexuality and desire to not date.\n\nThis person is not your friend. Cut your losses and find friends who actually appreciate you for who you are, and who will always treat your boundaries with the love and respect you deserve.", "NTA, you leaving like that is okay after she basically made a date for you when you made it clear you aren't interested in dating.", "NTA but your \"friend\" definitely is.. I'm also Asexual and had a similar experience with a so called friend. Here's a tip we are no longer in contact. Life is too short to keep people who refuse to accept us for who we are in our lives.", "NTA. She's not a friend at all.", "NTA. I'd think twice about if you want to keep someone like her in your life. Why is she concerned if you want to date or not?", "NTA. She isn't your friend. A friend would respect your identity and not force you into the social convention they find appropriate. \n\nAbout friendships: some are meant for a lifetime, some for a season. The season of your childhood is over, the things you held in common aren't there any more. It's OK to move on. Knowing her a long time doesn't obligate you to know her forever.", "NTA. Your friend has completely disrespected you. It's obvious she doesn't comprehend this isn't just a phase for you. Up to you if you want to educate her more or leave it up to her to figure out. You decide how much grace and time (if any) you want to give her.", "NTA. Please, for your own safety leave this friend behind. She doesn't believe that you're actually asexual, and things could get worse until you are forced into a situation you can't escape.", "NTA. Your friend is trying to force you into something you are not comfortable doing.  I don't care how you define yourself and admit that I don't understand the need to label things the way people do now.  I'm saying this only because I guess your friend thinks similar as me AND I still think your friend has crossed a giant boundary.  It was not okay.   You should be proud of yourself for sticking up for yourself and your boundary.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then she would tell you to act like a \"virgin\" and close your legs lol.. maybe she can still be a friend but you just need to let her know that your hard line boundary is your intimate life and if she brings it up again it's quits. If she can't tolerate that response she's no real friend", "NTA, and I wouldn't call this a friend. I'd call her a person with an unhealthy fixation on your sexuality. Being ace is not a bad thing, OP. If you say anything at all to her, tell her that you find her obsession with hooking you up for sex has crossed repeated boundaries and that you are no longer comfortable, as she has broken your trust repeatedly. OP, this 'friend' is mentally sick and I think the actual 'friend' part of the friendship ended long ago. You owe her nothing. You owe yourself peace of mind and not being exploited for whatever is messed up in her head. And you are never an asshole for leaving a situation like that.... ever.", "NTA\n\nGurl u need to drop them FAST. They never accepted u in the first place, this is homophobia.

Keep her blocked.", "NTA sorry sis but she is not your friend", "NTA. What either surprises are acceptable or they aren't. Surprise I brought you a date, surprise I left you with YOUR date.

People don't go around choosing their sexuality.", "Did you appreciate the dig in there? \n\n\"She set me up with someone who would sleep with me.\"\n\nThere's a weird mean girl implication in there about OP not being someone that people would want to be intimate with. Gross on all levels.", "Regardless of their choice, their \"friends\" should respect someone choice and if they don't want to date, or want to stay celibate shouldn't try and hook them up with people.", "the point is that sexuality is not a choice", "Not sure what that has to do with the judgement. The op told their friend what they believe their sexuality is and should be respected. \n\nIn my context, it is meant, that they told their friend what their choice was sexually and expected it to be followed. I wasn't saying anything about if it's a choice or they were born that way or anything."]}
