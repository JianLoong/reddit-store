What I never even tease about, is their choices about relationships or anything like that.\n\nThey're a friend, who is a human, with preferences, non-preferences and boundaries, and they deserve my respect. Everyone does, ofc, but friends more so.", "This, this, this. NTA but th\u00e9 \"friend\" sure is. Setting you up to sleep with someone on a surprise first date, is super gross and creepy behaviour, unless you had specifically indicated that it was something that you would be interested in and you have done the exact opposite when it comes to indication of your preferences.", "Frankly, the asexuality issue isn't even the main problem. What sane person decides their friend needs to sleep with someone asap and tries to pimp them out to the first available warm body? Even if the OP wasn't asexual and just didn't want to date, this would be incredibly disrespectful. Heck, even if the OP desperately wanted a partner, this would have been a really horrible way to matchmake.", "I didn't wake up one day choosing to like both men and women. You didn't wake up one day choosing to like your opposite sex. Just stop.", "Assume much about my sexuality. And I admitted it was poorly worded.", "It means what they said multiple times.\n\nSexuality is not. a. choice.\n\nPlease stop using the word choice.\n\nIt's not a choice.", "You really didn't.", "Hahahah what the hell. NTA\n\nShe's not on board with your sexuality? Did anyone ever tell her she can't dictate the movement of the planets or the fact that there's terrifying deep sea fish because those, along with your sexuality, are also facts about the world that she is not in charge of.\n\nI'm currently not on board with the cold I'm sneezing my way through, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.", "Nta. She sounds like she needs to get a life.", "NTA\n\nI'm also asexual. Your friend is disgusting. She tried to use you for a threesome. This isn't just gross territory, it's choosing to be a bigot and disregard you for what she wanted. \n\nI'm not the asexual guru, but this feels like it's bordering sexual harassment. Sexual harassment is defined as behavior characterized by the making of unwelcome and inappropriate sexual remarks or physical advances in a workplace or other professional or social situation.\n\nYour friend made inappropriate and unwelcome sexual remarks. You and the guy were both tricked and what seems like pressured into sleeping with her.", "NTA, OP. First of all, congratulations on coming into your sexuality, that is hard. Second, that \u201cfriend\u201d is not actually your friend. She deliberately went out of her way to set you up and try to get you to sleep with someone even though she KNOWS your sexuality. Also the whole \u201cget out of your Virgin phase\u201d sounds a bit like gaslighting and outright disrespect for not only your sexuality but your boundaries. Leave her behind and find a community and friend that actually supports you.", "NTA You confided in her and she totally disregarded it and decided she knew better. If she were truly a friend that cared about you, she would accept you where you are. Instead she belittled your stance and blew off how wrong she was for doing that. This is not a friend and you are better off putting some distance between you.", "\"she told me she wasn\u2019t totally on board on it.\"  Um, she doesn't need to be on board with it. She was WAY out of line, both with her words and her actions.\n\nNTA", "NTA, and your friend is weird af for being obsessed with you having sex. It's not like you being asexual has any effect on her. Why would she possibly be bothered by it?", "It can be difficult for sexual people to understand the asexual mindset... but in this case your friend is just being a jerk. It would be like if you told her you're a lesbian and she tried to hook you up with a guy. Or if you were hetero and she brought you a girl. It's rude and disrespectful and shows not only that she doesn't understand you, but that she doesn't care enough to even try. And the fact that she thinks you're just going through a phase... I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess she's bigoted in a lot of other ways too. She's not worth your time, and I hope you explain why you're cutting contact with her before you do it. Who knows? Maybe she'll end up a better person after all this. But you shouldn't stick around and wait for that to happen. Her struggle to becoming a decent human being is not your problem.", "NTA also good for you for wanting to wait or whatever, just sleeping with someone to become not a virgin sounds really unintelligent, you don\u2019t want to end up with diseases or being stuck with someone for the rest of your life, or just simply wasting something valuable on someone worthless. \nShe probably isn\u2019t a good friend so don\u2019t worry too much. If your choices offend her then she isn\u2019t much of a friend. You made the right choice", "NTA You had to leave, what else were you supposed to do, actually sleep with him so you wouldn't appear rude?", "From one ace to another: it's not ok that your friend isn't \"on board\" with it, and it's not fine.\n\nThe fact is she doesn't actually get a choice about who you are and what you're made of, let alone any kind of say about something so personal.\n\nThis shit isn't optional, this is your life, health and happiness. It is not a commentary on her, or her life choices, and your life is not her dollhouse, so she can butt right out. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nI don't know what is it with people that makes them think we should be grateful for them for arranging surprise blind dates for us like that.\n\nYour friend is really rude and her actions are uncalled for.", "NTA.  \u201c\u2026.she had set me up with someone who would sleep with me.\u201d  What are you, a brood mare?!  I\u2019d send he one text with that quote and say when she realizes human trafficking is illegal and how disgusting her behavior was, she can send you an apology letter.", "NTA\n\nno need to consider\u2014she\u2019s not the type of person you need in your life.\n\nWhen you want companionship it won\u2019t be on her terms and her opinions don\u2019t matter. \n\nThere\u2019s no such thing as a virgin phase too. She needs to throw up and stop shaming peoples sexuality.", "NTA. Your friend is not being a good friend. What exactly is she \u201c not on board with\u201d? And why can\u2019t you tell people. You are ace, not a dirty secret. So why is she trying to treat you like one? You can tell anyone you want about your sexuality. I hope you realize that she\u2019s in the wrong and distance yourself from her. You did the right thing. \n\nI know a lot of people think we don\u2019t exist or that being ace is just a phase, but you aren\u2019t alone.", "I can understand why someone might have issues with someone else being gay.  Might be a religious hangup.  Might be the same gender and suddenly you're skeeved out because you are running the entire friendship through your head wondering if every expressed emotion was platonic or had romantic undertones, not to mention that going forward, you have to consider all of those things.  I get it.\n\nBut \"I have no interest in anyone\"... how is that a problem?  How is that a threat?  How does that impact anyone else's life IN ANY WAY??  The only people who have any claim to being put out by this would be someone who gets rejected by a romantic advance, and that only extends to their own feelings about it, not any active response to the contrary.  \n\nAnd what the hell is the deal with anybody trying to gatekeep the sex life of anyone else?  The only other person's sex life you should be concerned with is the person you're having sex with.  Anything beyond that is locker room level gossip at best.", "Huh. Now I'm wondering if that's why the guy got uncomfortable. Op's \"friend\" might have tried to kill two birds with one stone- get the ace girl laid while turning the gay guy straight.", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nFirst, full disclosure.....I am female and totally straight. I love men. I'm married to one, gave birth to two and now have a grandson. That being said, there isn't a man on the planet that can't be replaced with 2 AA batteries!\n\nSex and men and batteries aside, YOU and ONLY YOU get to decide if, who, what, when, where, or how you date. Or don't! Your friend needs to concentrate on life and leave your life up to you! Sex isn't everything. On the list of this that make life worth living, sex isn't even in the top 10.\n\nYou are NOT the asshole and you friend owes you and the man an apology.", "NTA what the heck about being asexual would make someone think \u201cI\u2019m not onboard with that?\u201d\n\nThis person is not going to be capable of being your friend because you do not belong to her preconceived notions as to how you should be behaving.  You are required to date and spend the night at a males house in order for her to be Ok with you.  \n\nDump her. She\u2019s not worth it.", "NTA. Your insensitive aphobic friend is the asshole, especially since she had the audacity to behave as if she were doing you a favour by trying to \"cure\" your asexuality, and calling you ungrateful for it. This made me particularly upset since I'm ace, but even if I weren't, I'd be extremely angry if someone were to spring on me a blind date without bothering to ask me first. I could be the most allosexual person on the planet and even then the sheer disrespect of having a blind date forced down my throat - that too when my ostensible friend didn't bother to find out whether I'd even like that sort of date - would infuriate me.", "NTA She doesn\u2019t respect your sexuality. She\u2019s not a good friend or person, frankly, if she thinks she gets to dictate when and with whom you have sex.", "NTA. Your (ex)friend doesn\u2019t have veto rights on your sexuality.

Ace or not what op's friend did was very rude and  way out of line.", "Yes, there's \"I set up a date and found out they're gay, oops\" and \"I set up a date *because* they're gay and I can 'fix' them\".
