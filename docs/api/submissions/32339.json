He tries to visit whenever he can, and I try to help him have as much of a relationship with my children (9M, 5F and baby girl) as possible.\n\nWhenever he visits, however, he tends to act a bit entitled. He either sleeps or hangs out with his old friends in the mornings and afternoons, doesn't help me with anything I ask him to, and then gets annoyed when he wants to do something at 9PM and the kids are too tired. His excuses are always that he's exhausted from traveling, and deserves to get some rest and spend time with friends he never gets to see anymore.\n\nMy kids are always excited when my dad visits, but at this point, they see him more when he's FaceTiming us from a different hemisphere than when he's staying in our guest room.\n\nAnyway, he's visiting us now to meet my youngest daughter, who was born in September. He got here two weeks ago, and will fly back home in a few days. I've been trying to get him to spend more time with my kids this time around, but he still goes out a lot.\n\nMy older daughter had her first ever school play on Saturday. She was really excited about it, and invited my father. He promised her he'd come.\n\nThe day before the play, my father went out with his friends and didn't come back until 3AM. The play started at 11AM, and we had to get there 30 minutes earlier. In total, he must have gotten about 6 hours of sleep.\n\nWhen we (my dad, my husband, my son and me) got there, we sat at one of the first rows (my daughter had asked us to).\n\nThe play was 40 minutes long. My father fell asleep less than 15 minutes in. I woke him up; he slept again. He snores loudly when he sleeps, so I kept waking him up whenever he slept. Near the end of the play, I was too late to wake him, and he let out a snore that was so loud that some of the kids on the stage looked over at us. At that, I hit his arm a little harder, and he didn't fall back asleep.\n\nMy husband and I haven't mentioned anything to my daughter, but it's obvious she noticed. She was heartbroken after the play, and dismissed any of our attempts to talk about it.\n\nMy husband filmed the play for my mom and stepdad (who were with our baby during it). Instantly after the play, my dad asked if he could have the video too, since he didn't watch most of the play.\n\nWe're not sharing it with him. I told him that he had the opportunity to watch it live, and instead ruined the experience for all of us, specially my daughter. He doesn't deserve to watch what he missed just because he decided to stay out late the night before.\n\nMy dad's pissed. He's telling me and my husband that we're robbing him of his role in my daughter's life. He also maintains the excuse that he was exhausted during the play and needed to get some rest.\n\nI really don't think we're the AH, but with how tense things have been getting, it might be easier to just let him watch the video.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701710339, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ap0er/aita_for_not_sharing_my_daughters_school_play/", "score": 146, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2019ll 100% keep treating his family like this if he knows they\u2019ll have a camera ready for him. NTA.", "I did talk to him. Many times. It never works. He uses the \"I'm tired\" and \"I never get to see my friends\" excuses and then keeps doing it.", "This is what I'm trying to tell you: maybe you shouldn't let him. He doesn't seem to be there *for* any of you. He's going out with his buddies late into the night and sleeping in well into the day. You said everyone sees him more on video calls when he's at home. That's weird. It's like he's using your home as a free hotel. Why let him do that?", " Because he doesn\u2019t care enough to change.

There\u2019s a difference in intent.", "NTA - I think he needs to stay with those friends he so loves next time.  I'd put a stop to him using your house as a flop-house.  It's disappointing to see your dad's priorities, but you don't need to indulge him.  This seems hard on your kids (and I bet it is hard on you too).  Glad mom and step-dad where there and present.  Time for dad to stay somewhere else.", "Why are you letting him stay at tour house? If he wants to relax and see his friends, tell him to get a hotel when he visits his friends.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I'm sorry your dad sucks. I think it could be he feels entitled to being on his schedule when he stays with you. I'd recommend him staying somewhere else when he visits so he can actually dedicate time to the people he wants to see, without piggy backing on simply being near. It's pathetic of him, and it doesn't seem like talking is working, so he needs a good kick in the ass. He devastated your child. He should be begging for forgiveness.", "NTA at all \u201crobbing him of his role\u201d? \n\nBeing an ass and sleeping and being as involved in their lives as the wreck of the titanic is not a role.\n\nI feel this big time - my dad is just like this , he drops off candy , our oldest has sleepovers - he does NOTHING just sits in his chair falls asleep , watches shitty old westerns . \n\nAsks every child that comes in his house if \n\n1) wanna rub his feet cause he\u2019s \u201cso sore from working all day\u201d or\n\n2) want to be tickled , this isn\u2019t just his grandkids this is any child under 15 it\u2019s like he is possessed by the spirit of uncle touchy\n\n\nTell your dad he has no role in their lives and until he does you don\u2019t have to do shit for him", "What role?  Watching a video doesn't give him a \"role\"\n\nSet a boundary and stick to it.  If he just wants to use your house as a free place to stay while he goes out with friends - so be it.

You're unreasonably angry over an old man sleeping in a dark theater. Does it bother you that he moved away just a year after his first grandkid was born? My dad always sleeps through movies and plays and my family just laughs about it. Even an embarrassing snore will make a funny story in a few years. \n\nHe's an old man trying to cram too much into one vacation. It happens. Are you going to let it ruin the rest of the visit? Do you want him to make it up to you guys? If so, how? I don't think anyone is an asshole in this situation, but focusing on who is isn't going to help things get better.", "YTA.  Okay to tell him you his granddaughter was disappointed.  Keeping the video from him sounds punitive, and in no way constructive.", "NTA\n\nMy father has fallen asleep on plays, movies etc my whole life, BUT my kids does childrens theater and he has never fallen asleep during that. \n\nYour dad should just stay with his buddya next time.", "My mom is especially upset about this.

Handing over the remote control is too much of an effort sometimes.", "Yeah, that thought definitely crossed my mind. I'm pretty sure he was embarrassed about the snoring, and it would make sense for him to want the video because of that.", ">don't give in when he wants to do things with them at inappropriate times\n\nI never have. That's something I've always been strict about.

It's clear that is not his main agenda is. And that's fine, but then it means you need not accommodate him.\n\nStaying out until 3am?

How many times will you allow him to hurt and disappoint your kids before you grow a spine?", "Honestly I agree with innocua from what I read it feels like he wants the title of grandpa but doesn\u2019t really want to work for it. Only when it\u2019s convenient for him tbh", "Maybe stop being convenient to him? If he stays there, he can't be out past midnight, as that's an inconvenience to your family (you have small children and other responsibilities). \n\nIf your children see more of him when he's at his home than when he's in yours, then that means he's not visiting with you. You are just a free hotel.", "I\u2019m assuming the snoring is audible on the video? It maybe worth showing him the video to highlight how embarrassing his behaviour was.", "Don't model this doormat behavior to your kids.  They seem to have other, loving grandparents.  Don't show your daughter that it's ok to treat people poorly because they are family and it's \"more convenient\" for your dad.

I'm not sure it would change anything, he'll just insist he was tired.", "The video isn't the main problem. And quite frankly, he doesn't deserve to watch it. We filmed it for my mom because she volunteered to watch my baby while he went to the play with us, not as a backup plan in case he fell asleep.\n\nIt's not just because of my daughter's reaction. Had she not noticed, I'd still be pissed.\n\nAnd I literally said this is something he always does. His friends and his laziness (yes, laziness, because he usually gets plenty of sleep) are his priorities. Not me, not my children. And that has never been clearer than now.", "I\u2019d say if he\u2019s that pig headed then you\u2019re NTA and are well within your rights to refuse to give him it. As a parent of 2 young kids I\u2019d also be finding this excuse wearing thin rather quickly."]}
