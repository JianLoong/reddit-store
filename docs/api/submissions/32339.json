He either sleeps or hangs out with his old friends in the mornings and afternoons, doesn't help me with anything I ask him to, and then gets annoyed when he wants to do something at 9PM and the kids are too tired. His excuses are always that he's exhausted from traveling, and deserves to get some rest and spend time with friends he never gets to see anymore.\n\nMy kids are always excited when my dad visits, but at this point, they see him more when he's FaceTiming us from a different hemisphere than when he's staying in our guest room.\n\nAnyway, he's visiting us now to meet my youngest daughter, who was born in September.

In total, he must have gotten about 6 hours of sleep.\n\nWhen we (my dad, my husband, my son and me) got there, we sat at one of the first rows (my daughter had asked us to).\n\nThe play was 40 minutes long. My father fell asleep less than 15 minutes in. I woke him up; he slept again. He snores loudly when he sleeps, so I kept waking him up whenever he slept. Near the end of the play, I was too late to wake him, and he let out a snore that was so loud that some of the kids on the stage looked over at us. At that, I hit his arm a little harder, and he didn't fall back asleep.\n\nMy husband and I haven't mentioned anything to my daughter, but it's obvious she noticed.

I told him that he had the opportunity to watch it live, and instead ruined the experience for all of us, specially my daughter. He doesn't deserve to watch what he missed just because he decided to stay out late the night before.\n\nMy dad's pissed. He's telling me and my husband that we're robbing him of his role in my daughter's life. He also maintains the excuse that he was exhausted during the play and needed to get some rest.\n\nI really don't think we're the AH, but with how tense things have been getting, it might be easier to just let him watch the video.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701710339, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18ap0er/aita_for_not_sharing_my_daughters_school_play/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He sounds exhausting to deal with. If this is how he behaves why do you let him stay with you when he visits? He's not there for you and your family. He's there to go out with his buddies. Your family is just *there* and to me it seems like he's trying to make himself care when he has other, higher priorities. Don't let him have the video. He was being a jerk, his behavior ruined the play, and you know he upset your daughter.", "NTA\n\nRip Van Winkle can get over himself.  He's either a grandparent or he isn't.

The only negative is on his social life.\n\nThink on that.

Probably embarrassed that he looked bad and wanted to suddenly look like he cares so much", "He\u2019d fall asleep watching the video. He only wants to ASK for it, so he can somehow appease himself that he\u2019s really \u201cgrandfathering\u201d.", "NTA  tell him that his words and actions do not match.   Tell him that it appears from his actions that he is more invested in partying with his friends than building a relationship with his grandchildren and his daughter.  If his actions do not change perhaps he should stop coming and using your home as a hotel. \n\nYour daughter will be scarred by this and needs to know that you have her back.  Your dad needs a reality check and limits.   My husband and I cut off total contact with his parents when our kids were young because of their behavior.  It was to protect them from the toxicity, our  children got to know them when they were older and had a firm foundation in place.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
