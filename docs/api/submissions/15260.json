My youngest brother is married with a 4 months old daughter. Yesterday evening me, my girlfriend (27), my brother, his wife, his daughter, and my mom all went out to eat. Now, I'm a considerate person and I try to not only ensure my brother and his wife get breaks from the baby but also that I can help out however. \n\nThis was an upper class place that serves Chinese food and it was busy. Predictably right before our food comes my niece has enough and starts to cry. I immediately feel embarrassed, so I offer to take her out back to my brother's van and see if can calm her down. They accept, and I spent a good few minutes trying to calm my nice down. It doesn't work, so I text my GF to get our food to-go and we'll take her home so the others can have a nice dinner. \n\nMy GF comes out and moves the car seat to our car, and I go back inside and pack up our food. My mother is immediately annoyed, and asking why we can't stay. I explained to her that the baby was fussing and crying and I couldn't console her and I'm not gonna subject other diners to that. My sister in law looks relieved, hands me the diaper back and says thanks, my mother won't give it up. \n\nWe took my niece home and predictably got her to sleep and waited for the others. My mother keeps throwing a fit about it and about how we should have just stayed etc. I told her it was fine, that they deserved a night out and I don't want to subject others to the drama. My brother and sister in law were nothing but appreciative, so that's a plus. \n\nBut yeah, now my mother has our grandparents involved (and they're taking her side) and it's become a bit of a drama magnet over one decision to try and help out. I don't get it. \n\nFor context, as a teen/young adult I hated dealing with kids and how they would make noise in restaurants, on planes etc. I try to be better than most, and I always am happy to come and give my brother a break from his duties. \n\nDid I make myself the asshole?", "created_utc": 1682006669, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12t68lp/aita_for_taking_my_niece_home_when_she_started/", "score": 303, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I really respect that you were so aware of other people's the restaurant, and especially gracious toward your SIL and brother. They must be totally exhausted with a four-month old and really grateful for your involvement in your niece's life. Keep on doing what you're doing, because your good judgement is steering you in the right direction.", "Well you did the right thing and the kind thing in this situation.", "That was always me! I have been taking care of my nieces and nephews for over a decade. It definitely helped when the time came to have my baby to know what to expect. You're doing a good job!", "> They didn't want us to miss out and insisted we come along.\n\nYeah, which is why your mother was upset. This was a family event and you and your girlfriend noped out because **you** were embarrassed by a baby fussing for a few minutes.", "NTA by any means. I don't understand why he is making a problem out of nothing. Is it normal for him? What you do for parents. As a mother I would appreciate it too. Your brother and SIL and lucky to have you :)", "She was okay with it. She lets me handle things like this, her biggest concession she asked of me in the relationship was giving her two rooms to do her hobbies in as she wishes, as she makes clothing, and also is a huge Otaku type I think? Our relationship is great since she's pretty timid and prefers if I handle the decision-making most of the time.", "> Yeah, which is why your mother was upset. This was a family event and you and your girlfriend noped out because you were embarrassed by a baby fussing for a few minutes.\n\nHave you ever been with a crying kid in a loud place? The baby will cry louder to make itself heard over the noise. \n\nI was trying to be the helpful one and help out my sleepless sister in law in particular, she has been working nonstop on this.", "I guarantee everyone else nearby was thrilled that the screaming baby was removed. You and OPs mom seem to be the only ones who think it was a bad idea.", "Don\u2019t listen to this person, they probably have a screaming baby at home themselves and they don\u2019t wanna feel bad about taking that screaming baby to restaurants. You did a considerate thing for both your brother and SIL, and the rest of the restaurant. Your mother and grandparents are overreacting. It\u2019s not like this was a big family reunion, once in a blue moon kind of thing. There will be plenty of other family dinners. NTA."]}
