My youngest brother is married with a 4 months old daughter. Yesterday evening me, my girlfriend (27), my brother, his wife, his daughter, and my mom all went out to eat. Now, I'm a considerate person and I try to not only ensure my brother and his wife get breaks from the baby but also that I can help out however. \n\nThis was an upper class place that serves Chinese food and it was busy. Predictably right before our food comes my niece has enough and starts to cry. I immediately feel embarrassed, so I offer to take her out back to my brother's van and see if can calm her down. They accept, and I spent a good few minutes trying to calm my nice down. It doesn't work, so I text my GF to get our food to-go and we'll take her home so the others can have a nice dinner. \n\nMy GF comes out and moves the car seat to our car, and I go back inside and pack up our food. My mother is immediately annoyed, and asking why we can't stay. I explained to her that the baby was fussing and crying and I couldn't console her and I'm not gonna subject other diners to that. My sister in law looks relieved, hands me the diaper back and says thanks, my mother won't give it up. \n\nWe took my niece home and predictably got her to sleep and waited for the others. My mother keeps throwing a fit about it and about how we should have just stayed etc. I told her it was fine, that they deserved a night out and I don't want to subject others to the drama. My brother and sister in law were nothing but appreciative, so that's a plus. \n\nBut yeah, now my mother has our grandparents involved (and they're taking her side) and it's become a bit of a drama magnet over one decision to try and help out. I don't get it. \n\nFor context, as a teen/young adult I hated dealing with kids and how they would make noise in restaurants, on planes etc. I try to be better than most, and I always am happy to come and give my brother a break from his duties. \n\nDid I make myself the asshole?", "created_utc": 1682006669, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12t68lp/aita_for_taking_my_niece_home_when_she_started/", "score": 1014, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The baby's parents.", "Nta at all OP. My boyfriend's niece has a kiddo who is 9 months old and an almost 2 year old and on Easter (which was also my boyfriend's moms birthday) we all went to a restaurant to celebrate. Her older kid was having a grand time but he was bored a lot and wanted to go outside and look for eggs/play in the little playground area they had for the kids. We were waiting for our food, and he was starting to get loud and throw things and cause a scene because he was bored and the terrible twos have already started. And hey I get it - I don't handle being bored well either and the food wasn't ready yet. His little sister was quite happy at that point to sit in her high chair and babble at us, but he was bored. So... \n\nI did what any other rational human would do and offered to take big bro outside to hunt for eggs and play until our food got there. My boyfriend's niece was incredible thankful (her mom (bfs sister) and her grandma (bfs mom) are kinda judgemental of her parenting because they're ahs, and so she gets stressed and overwhelmed with them in public lol) and the lil dude and I found 3 eggs and played catch for about 10-15 minutes til our food got there. \n\nThen we went back inside and ate. I always end up finishing my food pretty early compared to everyone else because I have a small appetite. And naturally everyone was going slow and chit chatting because it was a celebration or whatever. But the little sister had eaten her baby food and played with her toys and was getting tired and fussy and starting to cry pretty loudly. They tried to put her in her carrier and rock her to sleep, but she's always been pretty sensitive to noise and so instead of sleeping when put down she started crying more because it was loud and she was mad she couldn't sleep.\n\nI was thus far the only one completely done eating, everyone else was still finishing up, and they'd tried to soothe the kid for a good few minutes at this point and I was like \"here why don't I take her outside where it's quite and walk around with her a bit and see if I can get her to settle into a nap\" and once again, tons of thanks, because everyone else wants to finish their meal and I didn't want the little baby to bother anybody else and anyways she was clearly frustrated and tired. We go out and walk around for 15 minutes while everyone else finishes their food and then they go to pay. About 10 minutes later my boyfriend is taking 2 year old outside to play some more so he's not disruptive while they're waiting in line to pay, and his little sister had fallen asleep in my arms pretty promptly. \n\nNot only was that polite to the other people around us - the kids weren't throwing a fit and disrupting everyone's meals - but it was what was best for the kids too. My boyfriend's family seems to think the kids should understand they have to stay quiet and seated during meals. They... are babies. They don't really understand that mindset. They don't have the ability to comprehend what they're doing \"wrong\" or why they need to sit still and not act crazy just yet. They don't even understand how to control their frustrations. It's best for the kids to help them process that - I mean the two year old didn't even throw a fit when we had to go back inside after going to play outside for a bit, which shocked my boyfriend's family. Funny, turns out when you acknowledge and meet the kids needs, they'll work with you even if they aren't enthused about it. \n\nAll of that to say - you did what was best for the baby, as well as for everyone else around you guys, and you let your brother and his partner have a peaceful meal. On each level you did the best thing for everyone.", "Your mother and grandparents belong to a different generation rife with entitlement. (Not all, but a LOT.) NTA and good on you for being considerate to the restaurant patrons and the parents.", "NTA\n\nLet me reinforce the good deed you did not only for your bro and SIL but also for the other diners and how selfish your mother and her supporters are being. \n\nFirst, a busy, noisy restaurant is no place for children, certainly not one of only 4 months. Not that it isn't possible for them to tolerate it; it is just unusual. \n\n Second, there are not only regular diners that don't want to deal with listening to a crying, upset baby, but there might just be a diner like me.\n\nI have a neuro condition that involves migraines (migraine is putting it lightly),  and that can quickly escalate to a stroke. Many things can instigate these episodes, and for that reason, I have a Medical Alert Service Dog. But all he can do is tell me it is starting so I can medicate and seek medical help faster.\n\n Given the right conditions, a screaming, crying baby in a noisy restaurant could potentially set this in motion. As a result, I don't go out much at all, but I also don't feel I should have to be a hermit.\n\nSo when your mom and her supporters come at you again, tell them you are NTA and possibly saved someone from a stroke!", "NtAH - you literally did the best thing for all parties. You removed a crying baby from the restaurant.  You gave your brother and his wife a break and allowed them some adult time to eat (that alone makes you a saint) and you enjoyed time with the little one.   Most kids at that age look cutest when asleep.  I don't know what your mother's issue was - but you did nothing wrong.  The fact that she then involved other family members seems like she knows she is wrong and is looking for allies to bolster her stance.", "NTA. THANK YOU for doing the reasonable thing", "you\u2019re NTAc your mom is a control freak and is pisses you dared defy her", " NTA you\u2019re an awesome uncle and sibling.", "NTA\n\nThe only people who\u2019s opinion should matter to you about this is your brother and SIL. They were grateful for you taking their daughter home and that\u2019s all that matters.", "NTA at all.\nWe should have more people thinking line you", "NTA. I don\u2019t get what it was your mother is actually upset with. That your brother should\u2019ve tended to the baby? That you left? That you tended to the baby? I\u2019m so confused what made her so upset. You were being a compassionate brother- and considerate of others. If you nor the baby\u2019s parents had issue with this, why does she?", "NTA, you\u2019re awesome!\n\nNot only did you save other diners dinners\u2026 you also gave your brother & SIL a nice break :)\n\nIf *they* had an issue with it, then that would have been different\u2026 they are the child\u2019s parents after all and do have the final say.\n\nYour mom probably just wanted to spend time with her granddaughter, but she can do that at another time. \n\nHopefully your mom didn\u2019t spend your brother & SILs nice dinner out complaining.", "NTA. In fact, you are a *saint* for not subjecting the other diners to that BS. Mother should be ashamed. I'm a full proponent of the notion that people who think it's okay to bring a crying child to a fancy restaurant can get f*cked and stay f*cked. No offense, I know family is important, but her behavior is ridiculous.", "this. nta. you are a kind soul and did (imo) what was best for all parties involved, as evidenced by what your SIL said. her and your brother are the parents so it\u2019s literally their opinion that matters w regards to this, if they were fine then i think it should be nbd", "Or for that matter, subjecting a miserable kid to a restaurant", "Spiceyhooligan is right.  NTA - You did the right thing.  Everybody in the restaurant liked that.", "[removed]", "And also as the parent of a four month old, thank you for giving them a break and letting them eat dinner without having to console the baby. definitely NTA.", "Yes! This!\n\nYou're NTA. You're awesome, actually.", "I wonder if their mom felt bad that she wasn\u2019t the one helping. Maybe OP jumping into action made her feel guilty, for lack of a better word, that she wasn\u2019t doing \u201cenough\u201d as a grandparent? Not to say that she should feel any kind of way, but the way she is holding onto it makes me think SHE took it personally. Idk \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Sometimes kids grow up telling themselves they won't treat other people the way their parents do.", "I'm wondering if your (OP's mom) was expecting the babys mom to deal with the baby.", "Smart idea.", "I love kids and I think that the baby hate on websites like this is completely unjustified. \n\nIf the child was special needs they wouldn't be saying those things. They're a crotch goblin if they are a normal healthy baby and \"fine\" if they're disabled in any way. It's a strange inversion.\n\nMy view is that parents should be considerate of others around them which is why I volunteered to take the kid home primarily to prevent embarrassment and ensure that my sister-in-law in particular didn't have to leave. I hang out with my mom on a regular basis but she doesn't get to see my sister-in-law and brother as much.", ">I respect the fact that in the past, crying babies in restaurants was not something that was looked down upon.\n\nLoud crying babies were definitely looked down upon in expensive restaurants 20-30 years ago.", "This is a four month old child. Not even talking or crawling.", "Ha, found the parent who lets their kids disrupt everything.", "I have 4 children, and when it comes to going out in public, I have always had this rule- *We do not ruin the experiences of others who have paid good money to be there*. FULL STOP. My kids learned from the time they were small that we *will* leave the restaurant, theater, store, museum, etc., immediately at any point, should they begin to detract from the experience that other people have paid their hard-earned money to enjoy. It\u2019s not fair to anyone, upset child included, to sit and pretend we aren\u2019t hearing the screaming. Don\u2019t be that guy. NTA. Wish more people would be NTA.", "Sibling of the year, my friend.   Well done all around.", "I don\u2019t know if your mom truly means well.  It seems she only wants to be on charge and get her way.  She is an adult , mother and grandmother and she calls her parents to back her up.  She is in the wrong and you are an awesome sibling.  Keep going with your instincts because they are right on track.  Your mother\u2019s are not.", "You gave the parents of a 4-month-old a night off. There's no conceivable universe where you're the AH!", "INFO: your mom and grandparents are the type of people who treat the restaurant staff like crap, right?", "Your mother is definitely an Ah. Try to explain all the details like  the type of restaurant to your grandparents (I am hesitant to call them ah too as they might not be aware of every detail) . They might not be aware of every aspect of this.\n\nNTA", "This is a bot who stole the comment from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12t68lp/comment/jh12bul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).", "I would have been kissing your feet if you\u2019d taken my crying baby and let me eat a hot meal!!! \n\nIs it some dumb sexism shit like the mum was the only one that should be inconvenienced by the crying baby?", "I didn't see an age for the mother, but considering OP's age she's probably close to mine (56). Maybe I shouldn't talk, because I was never a parent of young children, but my generation was very obnoxious as parents about the rights of children to public access. This was when signs like, \"Unattended children will be given an espresso and a free puppy,\" started appearing, either as a joke or unironically.\n\nI once went out to dinner with my brother and SIL, and they used a bunch of chairs to block out a play space on the floor between our table and the one behind so their kids could play with the trucks they brought on the floor. Fortunately, it was early, and there was one only one other table in the restaurant, and it was far away from us.\n\nMy parents made us bring books to the restaurant, and sit and read quietly. And they took us outside if we were acting up.", "ah, yes, that\u2019s entirely different then. NTA!", "Sorry i must have mixed up the Chinese restaurant with your heritage, but yea your mother\u2019s heritage sounds a lot more complicated", "THANK YOU. I wish every parent was like you.", "Amen! That is how I raised my daughter. It is the decent thing to do.", "That\u2019s what my Sister and her Hubby did with 6 kids. \nGood for you.", "Thank you!", "Yep, so much this. When my son was about 18 months, he had a meltdown inside a restaurant at Yosemite (didn\u2019t want to sit in a high chair). We snatched him up, looked around and apologized to everyone & left. \n\nI can remember (pre kid) thinking I would never be the parent that let their kids do this. \n\nOP you are a star & just awesome for doing this.", "[removed]", "And it's not like a 4 month old is going to be eating anything from the restaurant. If mom wants a family dinner with both of her sons and their spouses then her options at the moment are either to have it at someone's house where the baby can be accommodated or to hire a babysitter while the adults go out to eat.", "But she wants a nice family dinner! With everybody there! So *what* the four month old is crying, babies cry, people will get over it, isn\u2019t she *cute*?!?! How *dare* you take her away and we have to eat dinner without you! Pout. Foot stomp. \n\nI roll my eyes. \n\nOP is a *saint*. Everybody at the restraint,   (except mama), *thanks* OP.", "No, my mom is just a bit weird. I got her to calm herself down.", "You're wild. A crying baby potentially ruins everybody else's experience, in those situations it's rarely \"a few minutes\". If it was a simple family diner it might be more acceptable but not at a higher end \"adult\" restaurant. OP absolutely did the right thing trying to console the baby outside, as well as leaving when that wasn't possible. Mom is just having a bad reaction to OP knowing their family isn't the center of the universe.", "I think you replied to the wrong comment, mate. OP is the one with the good intentions and helpfulness to his SIL.", "Bot. Comment is stolen from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12t68lp/comment/jh12bul/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).", "Wait, two rooms for hobbys? Or your guys room plus the hobby room? If it\u2019s the former she must be mass producing by now!", "That's a bot, which is why the comment is misplaced. They're not smart enough to use stolen comments in a way that makes sense in context but at least it makes them easy to spot.", "The former. She has a room with rolls upon rolls of various fabrics and dressers full of reclaimed clothing bits. We sleep separately, mostly because I have RLS and it is uncomfortable for her. Her other room is a large closet with her anime and video game toy collections.", "You sound like a lovely and considerate person. It\u2019s super hard on the waitstaff too, working while there\u2019s a screaming baby in a contained area. \n\n\nIn regards to the issue in the post, your mom can pound sand. (She may be a great person otherwise, not trying to say she isn\u2019t, but she\u2019s dead-ass wrong about this.)"]}
