My youngest brother is married with a 4 months old daughter. Yesterday evening me, my girlfriend (27), my brother, his wife, his daughter, and my mom all went out to eat. Now, I'm a considerate person and I try to not only ensure my brother and his wife get breaks from the baby but also that I can help out however. \n\nThis was an upper class place that serves Chinese food and it was busy. Predictably right before our food comes my niece has enough and starts to cry. I immediately feel embarrassed, so I offer to take her out back to my brother's van and see if can calm her down. They accept, and I spent a good few minutes trying to calm my nice down. It doesn't work, so I text my GF to get our food to-go and we'll take her home so the others can have a nice dinner. \n\nMy GF comes out and moves the car seat to our car, and I go back inside and pack up our food. My mother is immediately annoyed, and asking why we can't stay. I explained to her that the baby was fussing and crying and I couldn't console her and I'm not gonna subject other diners to that. My sister in law looks relieved, hands me the diaper back and says thanks, my mother won't give it up. \n\nWe took my niece home and predictably got her to sleep and waited for the others. My mother keeps throwing a fit about it and about how we should have just stayed etc. I told her it was fine, that they deserved a night out and I don't want to subject others to the drama. My brother and sister in law were nothing but appreciative, so that's a plus. \n\nBut yeah, now my mother has our grandparents involved (and they're taking her side) and it's become a bit of a drama magnet over one decision to try and help out. I don't get it. \n\nFor context, as a teen/young adult I hated dealing with kids and how they would make noise in restaurants, on planes etc. I try to be better than most, and I always am happy to come and give my brother a break from his duties. \n\nDid I make myself the asshole?", "created_utc": 1682006669, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12t68lp/aita_for_taking_my_niece_home_when_she_started/", "score": 2817, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The baby's parents.", "Nta at all OP. My boyfriend's niece has a kiddo who is 9 months old and an almost 2 year old and on Easter (which was also my boyfriend's moms birthday) we all went to a restaurant to celebrate. Her older kid was having a grand time but he was bored a lot and wanted to go outside and look for eggs/play in the little playground area they had for the kids. We were waiting for our food, and he was starting to get loud and throw things and cause a scene because he was bored and the terrible twos have already started. And hey I get it - I don't handle being bored well either and the food wasn't ready yet. His little sister was quite happy at that point to sit in her high chair and babble at us, but he was bored. So... \n\nI did what any other rational human would do and offered to take big bro outside to hunt for eggs and play until our food got there. My boyfriend's niece was incredible thankful (her mom (bfs sister) and her grandma (bfs mom) are kinda judgemental of her parenting because they're ahs, and so she gets stressed and overwhelmed with them in public lol) and the lil dude and I found 3 eggs and played catch for about 10-15 minutes til our food got there. \n\nThen we went back inside and ate. I always end up finishing my food pretty early compared to everyone else because I have a small appetite. And naturally everyone was going slow and chit chatting because it was a celebration or whatever. But the little sister had eaten her baby food and played with her toys and was getting tired and fussy and starting to cry pretty loudly. They tried to put her in her carrier and rock her to sleep, but she's always been pretty sensitive to noise and so instead of sleeping when put down she started crying more because it was loud and she was mad she couldn't sleep.\n\nI was thus far the only one completely done eating, everyone else was still finishing up, and they'd tried to soothe the kid for a good few minutes at this point and I was like \"here why don't I take her outside where it's quite and walk around with her a bit and see if I can get her to settle into a nap\" and once again, tons of thanks, because everyone else wants to finish their meal and I didn't want the little baby to bother anybody else and anyways she was clearly frustrated and tired. We go out and walk around for 15 minutes while everyone else finishes their food and then they go to pay. About 10 minutes later my boyfriend is taking 2 year old outside to play some more so he's not disruptive while they're waiting in line to pay, and his little sister had fallen asleep in my arms pretty promptly. \n\nNot only was that polite to the other people around us - the kids weren't throwing a fit and disrupting everyone's meals - but it was what was best for the kids too. My boyfriend's family seems to think the kids should understand they have to stay quiet and seated during meals. They... are babies. They don't really understand that mindset. They don't have the ability to comprehend what they're doing \"wrong\" or why they need to sit still and not act crazy just yet. They don't even understand how to control their frustrations. It's best for the kids to help them process that - I mean the two year old didn't even throw a fit when we had to go back inside after going to play outside for a bit, which shocked my boyfriend's family. Funny, turns out when you acknowledge and meet the kids needs, they'll work with you even if they aren't enthused about it. \n\nAll of that to say - you did what was best for the baby, as well as for everyone else around you guys, and you let your brother and his partner have a peaceful meal. On each level you did the best thing for everyone.", "Your mother and grandparents belong to a different generation rife with entitlement. (Not all, but a LOT.) NTA and good on you for being considerate to the restaurant patrons and the parents.", "NTA\n\nLet me reinforce the good deed you did not only for your bro and SIL but also for the other diners and how selfish your mother and her supporters are being. \n\nFirst, a busy, noisy restaurant is no place for children, certainly not one of only 4 months. Not that it isn't possible for them to tolerate it; it is just unusual. \n\n Second, there are not only regular diners that don't want to deal with listening to a crying, upset baby, but there might just be a diner like me.\n\nI have a neuro condition that involves migraines (migraine is putting it lightly),  and that can quickly escalate to a stroke. Many things can instigate these episodes, and for that reason, I have a Medical Alert Service Dog. But all he can do is tell me it is starting so I can medicate and seek medical help faster.\n\n Given the right conditions, a screaming, crying baby in a noisy restaurant could potentially set this in motion.
