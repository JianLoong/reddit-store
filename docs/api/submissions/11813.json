{"id": 11813, "submission_id": "11m4hhv", "title": "AITA for refusing to invite my fianc\u00e9's sister to our wedding?", "selftext": "My fianc\u00e9 (28M) and I (27F) are getting married next year. His family is Spanish but all of them speak perfect English. I don't speak Spanish at all. When I visit his family, no one ever switches to English. They all always act like I am not there. They just don't make effort to include me in their conversations at all. I swallowed this for years and I learned to live with it. However, I can't stand how his little sister (27F) treats me. Here are some examples:\n\n1. When we visit his family, she always asks my fianc\u00e9 if they can spend time in 2 - to have some quality sibling time. Without me. Since I don't know anybody in Spain, it just means that they are going out for a whole day and I just stay alone with their parents (which are ignoring me). I cannot comprehend how people can treat their guests like that. I would never dream to tell my fianc\u00e9 to stay in a room in my hometown because I need some quality time with my sister.\n2. I hate the smell of cigarettes. My nose is sensitive and it just can't stand it. I never have problems with it in public - when I smell it, I just move to avoid standing next to a smoker. His sister is a smoker and she knows I hate the smell. She was asked many times to move her smoking elsewhere when I am present, however she always refused. There were times when we were eating a lunch, and she was smoking next to me - knowing it disturbs me a lot. When I wanted to leave the table for 5 mins to wait out the smoke, my fianc\u00e9 was calling me rude. Also when I was refusing to sit down next to her - I was apparently being offensive.\n3. We were planning a family trip. One day I was talking to my SO in English, when his sister comes between us and starts talking to my fianc\u00e9 in Spanish - ignoring my presence completely. He told me that his sister came and asked him to not bring me to that family trip, that it will be better without me, and that I am not welcome there.I felt super disrespectful that someone can stand in front of me and say all these things in other language knowing I wouldn't understand.\n4. There were many moments when I was having an English discussion with my fianc\u00e9, and his sister was just coming in and interrupting us without even \"hi\" towards me. She was just starting speaking in Spanish to my fianc\u00e9 and I was just standing there.. feeling very unwelcome.\n5. She advised my fianc\u00e9 to break up with me many times. She was telling his whole family mean stuff about me. Apparently that I am jealous, toxic, etc. None of it is true. I was very hurt hearing it, but I get it. If she felt like it, she should inform her brother. But not supporting our relationship makes me not want to invite her to our wedding.\n6. More subtle stuff but characters limit so..\n\nNow we are preparing a guest list. I don't want to invite her. I know I won't have a good time on my own wedding if she's there. Things she was doing to me were subtle, but I always felt excluded and bad.\n\nAITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT: I am learning Spanish. My current level is B1. All those situations above happened when I didn't speak a word in Spanish, and I didn't want to confuse people by saying I know Spanish now.

The action that should be judged is a lack of invitation to my fiance's sister. His sister is his closest family. They all are Spanish and it's unbelievable in their culture to not invite someone close like their sibling to their wedding. Even in my culture, not inviting someone as close as a sibling doesn't seem appropriate. I was just wondering if her actions justify me not inviting her to the wedding, or - if I am the asshole for trying to exclude someone close to my fiance. I am torn apart because I feel like looking for my own comfort zone isn't as important as my fiance having his closest people next to him during his wedding day.

You don't need Reddit, you need a freaking spine transplant!", "ESH.\n\nTo your points:\n\n1. It's Spain. You can absolutely find things to do by yourself in Spain for a few hours (spoken as someone who does not speak any Spanish and has travelled through Spain by myself without problems, including the less touristy/ more rural places). It's not unreasonable for them to want to spend time as siblings without you, especially since you don't speak the language or get along with each other and haven't, apparently, tried to learn Spanish despite being engaged to someone from Spain. Even if you are unable to venture out of the home, a day spent reading a book or entertaining yourself should not be a big deal and it's not their fault their parents aren't welcoming (parents are assholes here for this one). This one is mostly on you though. Have you not considered trying to learn enough Spanish to engage more? Have you considered asking him to introduce you to friends and more distant family who might be more welcoming? Have you considered trying to make casual friends if you visit occasionally? Have you considered asking him to help you plan something to do on your own for a day? Have you considered walking around or even just watching local television while there to try to pick up even a smattering of the language? The lack of independence here is startling and I wouldn't be surprised if part of the claims that you are jealous or toxic come from you making it clear that you don't want them spending alone time together/ come from the high degree of codependency you are demonstrating here. It is showing jealousy that you can't even give her a day of time alone with her sibling.\n2. Yes, cigarette smoke is gross and she shouldn't be smoking in front of you. She's the asshole for that. But the bigger asshole in this situation is your partner. He's the one getting upset with you and accusing you of being rude when you tried to engage in the best solution possible since she refuses to stop smoking. Your fianc\u00e9 should not have called you rude here and you need to talk to him and be on the same page about how to handle the cigarette smoke issue as a team. Excusing yourself briefly is not rude in this context. Moreover, if he knows you can't sit next to her due to the smoke he can subtly arrange seating at places so you aren't next to each other, pick spaces where there is a lot of space and open air, find things for you to do together that are less conducive to smoking, etc.\n3. She is being the asshole here for how she approached it, but she's not wrong to say she'd be uncomfortable traveling with you. The two of you don't get along. She can't smoke around you or speak in her native language with her family of origin. You're visibly uncomfortable around her. You also made it clear you can't independently do things while traveling. You've made it clear she doesn't get much time to talk to her brother alone so I'm not sure when else she should bring this up. The two of you sound pretty incompatible as co-travelers and you clearly do not like or want to integrate with his family, so it is a little strange that you'd even want to come on family vacations. I assume it is because you want to travel with his partner. Your fianc\u00e9 sucks for not speaking up for you here. It is his responsibility to say, in English, \"this is my partner who I love. I see her as family and want her to come on family trips. If she is not welcome then I do not feel welcome either and won't come. You need to either decide to work to make her feel more welcome or decide to forgo having both of us in attendance. Which will it be?\" It is unreasonable of you to expect her to be excited about the idea of traveling with you given the fact that you are demonstrating you're uncomfortable as a traveler when visiting their home.\n4. Again, learn some Spanish. Say hi to her in her language. It's really rude to repeatedly visit someone in another country and refuse to learn even small conversational parts of the language there. You aren't making an effort here and then are getting upset that she is responding by also not making an effort. I'm not saying you and she will ever be friends, but it is a problem (and stereotypical of a lot of English speakers, unfortunately) that you're assuming they should all be the ones to make the first overture of switching to English for you just because they happen to speak both. You're basically expecting an entire family to shift their culture to accommodate you. Sure, it would be nice for them to try to make an effort with you in English, but it does go both ways. I suspect this would have all been much easier if you'd bothered to find a way to talk to them a little bit in their own language when visiting. It's been years. Even if you are someone who struggles deeply with languages, the right thing to do here is make some effort.\n5. This is not a unilateral decision that either you or your fianc\u00e9 should be making alone. What does he want? What happens when you talk about the implications of him having family who do not support your relationship? Quite frankly, the wedding is the least of your problems. If he is close with his family, plans to continue to visit them, etc. then the two of you need to have a plan for how to mutually support each other while also setting boundaries. Do not marry this man until you are in agreement about how to handle some of the nuances of this and the \"what ifs.\" Her behavior has been, mostly, passive aggressive and your way of handling it has not been the most graceful either. Some of what she is doing and saying is even reasonable (though not all). He's the one who is being the bigger asshole by failing to respond effectively or protect you from the bad stuff. But, you will not win if you use your wedding to try to alienate his family to prove a point.\n\nAs for your last comment: \"I know I won't have a good time on my own wedding if she's there. Things she was doing to me were subtle, but I always felt excluded and bad.\" How big of a wedding are you actually having and how much interaction will you actually have to have with her? Nothing you're describing is so actively offensive that it would cause you to feel unsafe or make other guests massively uncomfortable. Some of this is about you working through your feelings. It's your wedding, she can't make you feel excluded unless you let her do so. If you recognize her and being the asshole, why do you feel bad? Most people rarely spend more than 1-2 minutes interacting with the majority of their wedding guests. Is it really worth the conflict with his entire family to exclude her in order to prove a point? Just have it at a smoking-free venue (assuming those exist where you live), don't include her in any major way, and ask him or other trusted guests to run interference and keep her away from you on your day. I highly doubt, based on your description of her behavior, that she wants to talk to you anymore than you want to talk to her. On the other hand, given his defense of her, it is probably fairly important to him that she be there.\n\nGiven your partner's behavior by the way (telling you all the rude things she says but then getting mad at you in front of her/ accusing you of being rude) I think you need to stop and seriously consider how much of a role he is playing in all of this (whether intentional or inadvertently). He's shown her, through his behavior, that how she treats you in front of him does not matter to him (which means it is likely the same or worse when you're not around). He's shown you that he is willing to repeat a lot of things that don't fully need to be repeated. What do you think he is telling his family about you that they don't want you around (either verbally or through behavior)? It doesn't sound like he's made much of an effort to help you integrate with them. It might be time to take a step back and consider whether he is a part of the problem here. Coming from a multicultural family I would have, in his place, absolutely prepared you for the expectation that you'd need to pick-up some of the language, be able to be by yourself occasionally, know some cultural customs, etc. to get by. Did he seem like he cared about whether you got along with his family from the beginning? Did he initially try to help you all communicate more together or find shared interests and commonalities? Was he considerate of your attempts to try to engage with them? Is he speaking English when addressed in Spanish by them or translating for you? Strongly consider what role he has played in all of this. If you frequently visit this should have been addressed years ago, well before you got to the wedding stage of things.\n\nPutting up with it for years and then blowing it up before the wedding is a terrible strategy. It's going to cause a lot of resentment and further bad blood here. Talk to him instead about what the two of you want for your future marriage. Will you keep going on these visits? What will they be like for you? What will it be like when his parents are elderly and need care? If you do have children what languages will they learn and how will things go between them and their aunt if she continues to mistreat you? These are all much bigger issues than whether she is in the background somewhere on your wedding day.", "NTA. For one I'm not sure why you let your fianc\u00e9 treat you like that. Family or not if he cares about you he should not be letting his family disrespect you regardless. Secondly you have no obligation to invite somebody to your special day that has been so disrespectful to you and dose not respect your wishes. I'm not sure how your marriage is going to be if your fianc\u00e9 lets his own family talk to you and treat you like this. If I were in your shoes I would dump him.", "My guess: they are xenophobic. \n\nINFO: Who told you that they want him to break up with you? As you didn't understand Spanish then.

Or did he tell you they said all these things? \n\nWhy would you marry him, if he is not on your side? you would be TA to yourself if you married him with that current dynamic.  Of course you are NTA for not wanting her there. I would reconsider if he should be there.", "ESH. You've been with this man for years and you haven't bothered to learn at least basic Spanish. The first point about her wanting to spend quality time with her brother sounds reasonable. He isn't forcing you to just stay at the home and not do anything, you boxed yourself into that.

His family is Spanish but all of them speak perfect English. I don't speak Spanish at all. When I visit his family, no one ever switches to English. They all always act like I am not there. They just don't make effort to include me in their conversations at all. I swallowed this for years and I learned to live with it. However, I can't stand how his little sister (27F) treats me. Here are some examples:\n\n1. When we visit his family, she always asks my fianc\u00e9 if they can spend time in 2 - to have some quality sibling time. Without me. Since I don't know anybody in Spain, it just means that they are going out for a whole day and I just stay alone with their parents (which are ignoring me). I cannot comprehend how people can treat their guests like that. I would never dream to tell my fianc\u00e9 to stay in a room in my hometown because I need some quality time with my sister.\n2. I hate the smell of cigarettes. My nose is sensitive and it just can't stand it. I never have problems with it in public - when I smell it, I just move to avoid standing next to a smoker. His sister is a smoker and she knows I hate the smell. She was asked many times to move her smoking elsewhere when I am present, however she always refused. There were times when we were eating a lunch, and she was smoking next to me - knowing it disturbs me a lot. When I wanted to leave the table for 5 mins to wait out the smoke, my fianc\u00e9 was calling me rude. Also when I was refusing to sit down next to her - I was apparently being offensive.\n3. We were planning a family trip. One day I was talking to my SO in English, when his sister comes between us and starts talking to my fianc\u00e9 in Spanish - ignoring my presence completely. He told me that his sister came and asked him to not bring me to that family trip, that it will be better without me, and that I am not welcome there.I felt super disrespectful that someone can stand in front of me and say all these things in other language knowing I wouldn't understand.\n4. There were many moments when I was having an English discussion with my fianc\u00e9, and his sister was just coming in and interrupting us without even \"hi\" towards me. She was just starting speaking in Spanish to my fianc\u00e9 and I was just standing there.. feeling very unwelcome.\n5. She advised my fianc\u00e9 to break up with me many times. She was telling his whole family mean stuff about me. Apparently that I am jealous, toxic, etc. None of it is true. I was very hurt hearing it, but I get it. If she felt like it, she should inform her brother. But not supporting our relationship makes me not want to invite her to our wedding.\n6. More subtle stuff but characters limit so..\n\nNow we are preparing a guest list. I don't want to invite her. I know I won't have a good time on my own wedding if she's there. Things she was doing to me were subtle, but I always felt excluded and bad. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
