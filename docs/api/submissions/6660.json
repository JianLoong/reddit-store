To be fair to the ex, she was already 27 at the time and wanted kids. Many people don't want kids until they get married. While I in no way believe in women \"being past their prime\" or whatever when it comes to age and pregnancy, she was getting relatively close to an age where pregnancies can become high risk. If they got engaged at 27, and got married at, idk, 30? (I don't know how long engagements typically last) That's five years to have kids in before pregnancies start counting as geriatric pregnancies, which are well-known to be high risk*. If they have issues with getting pregnant or have to deal with miscarriages or owt like that, that takes away from the potential time to have children too. And if they want more than just a couple kids, that's a pretty tight deadline.\n\nFertile people with dicks can get others pregnant at any time in their life. But if people who can get pregnant want to get pregnant, they have a relatively short amount of time to do it in. If you don't start popping out kids till you're 18, you really only have about 17 years before pregnancies become considered high risk no matter the circumstances. So if you're adamant on wanting kids for whatever reason (I personally don't understand it, but different strokes for different folks and all that), unless you're willing to take the risk, adopt, or use a surrogate, once you get to a certain age you do need to find a partner with the same desire. \n\n\n\n*I am aware that plenty of people over 35 do end up getting pregnant, but going down the most logical route, people who want to ensure they have the healthiest pregnancy possible probably won't want to. Correct me if I'm wrong though, I'm childfree myself so have no clue how the thought processes of those that want kids go", "How are they assholes?
