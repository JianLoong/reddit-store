My girlfriend's mom gave  my girlfriend's sister \"Marge\" a list of items, including alcohol, to go get. Marge asked me to drive her to the store. I asked my girlfriend if she needed my help with anything at the house. She said \"no, go supervise Marge.\" I thought nothing of her phrasing at the time, but apparently it was significant.\n\nAt the store, Marge asked me to get several items to save time, but she never actually handed me the list. She just said stuff like \"can you grab napkins?\" When we were leaving I asked if she wanted me to pay for anything, but she said no. When we got back my girlfriend and Marge got in a huge fight about Marge getting the wrong items, specifically her not getting my girlfriend's favorite wine, which was on the list, and instead getting a different wine that wasn't.\n\nMy girlfriend was also mad at me for not supervising like she told me to. She asked why I didn't make sure Marge got everything on the list. I didn't really feel it was my place to manage Marge like that. I never even saw the list, so it's not like I could have just gone and gotten the wine myself, because I had no clue the list wasn't being adhered to. My girlfriend said I should have texted her when I realized we hadn't gotten her favorite wine. I didn't really notice. For all I knew they had a bottle at the house.\n\nMy girlfriend thinks I was being cheap and lazy, but I don't think it's reasonable to expect me to know that Marge would go off list. Also, it's just wine. The wine served with dinner was fine.

You\u2019re a fully capable adult and could have asked for it rather than coasting into a chauffeur role.

He knows me well enough to ask if he needs any specific info and in which cases but we\u2019ve been together a long time. People are not mind readers!! She withers needs to tell you what is required or just accept that you were there to help the person holding the list. NTA and im sure she knows had she asked you specifically for anything you would have got it. These holidays just get everyone a bit stressed but she needs to communicate these things to you.", "If she didn't trust her sis, you should have been the one given the list.
