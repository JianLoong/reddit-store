I remarried 4 years later. I met my husband a year after losing my late husband, we were friends for several months, dated some, stronger feelings developed and I introduced him to the kids to see how they would get along, we halted for a year while my kids and I did some therapy because their reaction to my husband was strongly negative, because they didn't want to replace their dad. But once therapy was ongoing they were doing better. From there things moved faster but the kids were on board for things to move on. They were clear, however, that my husband was not going to be filling the role of a dad in their lives. My husband said he was fine with that as long as he was respected and they could work toward being caring family.\n\nCalla and I were always close but she was a real daddy's girl. Losing her dad was extremely tough for her. She did form a nice relationship with my husband but it comes nowhere close to the bond she had with her dad. From the age of 12 she and I became much closer. I think my parenting style as well as my willingness to talk about her dad even after I remarried made me someone she felt she could be open with. She was 15 when she told me if she ever got married she would want me to walk her down the aisle and for us to do a mother/daughter dance instead of a father/daughter one. I told her we could dance to the song her dad used to sing to her. She said she loved the idea. Even though she seemed to mean it, I always assumed things would change when she got older. I figured she would choose to walk alone, with her brother as a representation of her dad and their close relationship as well as for the societal expectation for a man to do it, or with her husband.\n\nBut when she got engaged three weeks ago she asked me right away. She brought up our past conversation and told me she wanted exactly that. I told her I would be honored. We cried tears of joy together. I told her that her dad would be so proud.\n\nMy husband took the news in a way I did not expect. His first question was whether I suggested she ask us both to do it and I told him no. Then he asked if she ever considered asking him and I said I could not answer that for her. He asked me if I thought of him when I said yes. He asked whether I gave any thought to all he has done for Calla, for both kids, and the fact he's still not looked upon as a fatherly figure all these years later. I told him I did not think of him when asked because I was overjoyed. He told me I should have given him a lot more consideration and I should have tried to compromise with my daughter.\n\nI thought he would change his stance but now three weeks on and he feels I was wrong. He told me he felt he deserved more from all of us, but especially me. He said I am his wife. I should be working on making sure he is respected and honored for his contribution to the kids' lives.

Although I wonder, does he feel entailed because he's the step-father or is he contributing financially with the wedding? If it's the latter, maybe that's why he feels that way? Either way is your daughter's decision.", "NTA. Your husband is ~~dead~~ wrong [edit: didn't catch that Freudian slip. Oops]. This isn't about him and all he's done. It's about Calla. She lost her dad and, while the grief fades a bit over the years, big events bring it roaring back in (at least that's been my experience). Her wedding is going to be bittersweet. She needs her parent (the one she's always had and the one who loved her dad) to \"give her away.\"\n\nI'm surprised that you expected Calla to change her mind. And I'm glad you accepted and did not try to offer any alternate suggestions, thereby ruining the moment. I'm not sure what your husband thinks he deserves but he's coming off as quite selfish and entitled. Y'all went to therapy while you were on pause with him, but has he ever been? He needs it.\n\nETA: I wanted to add after reading the other comments, while I do think it's nice to generally consider others' feelings, she doesn't owe it to her stepdad/your husband to apologize about this. She has been clear about what she's wanted for years. He's the one who decided he should be given this role when he was never promised it. She's not responsible for his feelings. You aren't either OP, so while you can show empathy and try to understand where he's coming from, he owes you and Calla the same - empathy and understanding someone else's perspective that doesn't center him.", ">all he has done for Calla, for both kids, and the fact he's still not looked upon as a fatherly figure all these years later\n\n> I should be working on making sure he is respected and honored for his contribution to the kids' lives\n\nIgnoring everything else about his entitlement and total assholery, you should ask him \"Why are you more worthy of respect and honor in Calla's life than ME?\" Does he think you don't deserve these honors??? (sexist traditions blah blah).\n\nNTA. This is a ridiculously happy and exciting time for you and your daughter and your husband is making it all about himself.", "NTA - the real question here is why does your husband believe he's more entitled to this honor of walking your daughter down the aisle, and \"giving\" her away than YOU? You, who is her mother, who has been there through it all, who has comforted and given her a home and place to be herself, unconditionally?", "NTA\n\nThis is what she wants on her wedding day and what she's planned and fantasized about since she was 12 years old. This is HER day, not his.  There's no disrespect towards him as He. Is. Not. Her. Father. Full stop. \n\nShe's gone most of her life without her dad, but I guarantee she's thought of him just about every day, as I've thought of mine every day since I lost mine. It's not that she doesn't care about her stepdad, but to her, she probably feels it'd be disrespectful to her father's memory. Plus you said they reacted very negatively towards him, to the point where you took a break for a year to work it out in therapy. Just because she seemed okay with him, she's made it clear she's never looked at him as a father figure. He needs to learn to accept that.", "NTA Your husband went into your marriage knowing that your children were adamant he would not replace their father. And it sounds like he did a pretty good job of understanding that, until now. I\u2019m sure he has contributed to your daughter\u2019s life in many positive ways. So it\u2019s not surprising that even though he knew he could not be a replacement for her father, he\u2019s still a bit hurt/ disappointed that now she\u2019s getting married he\u2019s kinda a nobody in her big day. But it is ***her*** big day and the decision of who she does what with on that day lies with her. It\u2019s wonderful that you have a relationship with your daughter that is strong enough that she would ask you to fulfil these roles and you are right to feel proud of that too. I hope that there will at least be some recognition of the role your husband played in your daughter\u2019s life, either in the speeches on the day or a private moment between them beforehand.", "NTA\n\nThe way you framed this, the kids went to therapy and found peace and strength in the understanding that this new man would not be trying to  push himself into the father role. This was their clear emotional boundary, and it seems your daughter in particular held on to this to feel safe in this new dynamic.\n\nDid they call your husband dad or any other parental names? Did he parent them, discipline, setting boundaries etc? \n\nStep parents don't get to marry into a family and expect them to latch unto them as a saviour or new parent. I get that he's hurt. YOU are your daughter's parent. Clearly he feels he \"deserves\" more, but didn't he do all the things he did without hope for reward?  He should see a therapist and work on his feelings, the same way the kiddos went to therapy to learn how to identify and deal with theirs.", "NTA  \nThose who are getting married are the ones who decide who is in their bridal parties. He should know this, he's gotten married himself!\n\nExplain to him that she is your daughter and whilst you love him, you will not push or even suggest she changes her wedding plans to cater to his demands. The fact he is continuing this narrative suggests he is not acting very fatherly at all, if anything he seems like a child who has thrown his toys out the pram.", "NTA. Your husband knew from the *beginning* that the kids didn\u2019t want him to fill the dad role in their lives. Frankly, it\u2019s selfish of him to ask for your daughter to compromise on this.", "> We accept you, but you will never be our dad\n\n> I'm fine with that \n\n> Why didn't they ask me to the father daughter dance? \n\nNTA.", "NTA", "NTA, it\u2019s your daughters wedding, she chooses, not your husband. And it\u2019s not on you to make suggestions or change her mind. I think it\u2019s a beautiful thing that she asked you and It is in no way a reflection on how she feels about your husband but rather one that shows how much she loves you", "NTA.\n\nHe agreed to never be their father in the first place, and assuming this has never been expressed as a strong disagreement ever since, he has not a bloody reason to expect anything from your daughter nor be mad at you.", "Nta, while y\u2019all can discuss his feelings at the end of the day it\u2019s up to the bride. I\u2019m sure after 10 years she appreciates him but she wants her parents still. She wants to dance with her only living parent to a song the deceased parent loved. It\u2019s almost like having him also at the wedding (I\u2019m guessing). \n\nYour daughter will never forget her dad and like you said they have a good bond but its nothing like how she was with her father. I understand his feelings but this isn\u2019t about him. He doesn\u2019t \u201cdeserve\u201d anything. He\u2019s your husband, who stepped up for your kids, but that\u2019s what you do when you date/marry a single mom. It\u2019s a package deal. If he wanted someone to really play the full dad role with he should have discussed children with you. \n\nNta at all", "NTA. \n\nThis is her wedding day, and she can do it now she likes. \n\nI went to a wedding recently where the bio dad was sulking because the step dad had been asked to walk the bride down the aisle. It just made him look like a child tbh.", "He deserves. He expects respect and honor for the role he has played. No. No. No. parents, stepparents- the work you put in to raise and keep your children alive does not EARN you a place in their life. I can\u2019t handle it with these stepparents who believe If they play the role long enough they\u2019ll be accepted as a replacement parent and then resenting the child when it does not play out how they had hoped. You\u2019re allowed to wish for more, you\u2019re allowed to feel sad- but it\u2019s not okay to take that out on the child or your spouse. The question should be is my stepchild happy with our relationship and my role in their life? If so then fantastic and move on. NTA and I\u2019m sorry he\u2019s taking the joy away from you both- simply stated, this is not about him.", "NTA. It is up to the bride, and only the bride, to decide who to ask to walk her down the isle. \n\nYou should be honoured she asked you.", "NTA but I swear I read a post exactly like this from what would be your daughter's perspective a week or two ago", "No one is the AH here. But some of you are pretty harsh!\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be ok for him to demand to the daughter that he be included, and it appears that he hasn\u2019t done this. He\u2019s shown restraint.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s totally reasonable for him to feel hurt. Even though he knows he\u2019s not the dad and he\u2019s been told before he wouldn\u2019t be asked, that doesn\u2019t mean that it wouldn\u2019t still be disappointing and upsetting for him. He\u2019s not a robot. And it\u2019s an indication that he has developed genuine affection for his step daughters which is admirable, lots of step parents don\u2019t. \n\nHe\u2019s told his wife about his disappointment because\u2026she\u2019s his wife. Married people are supposed to share their thoughts and feelings. Would you prefer he bottled things up and let his feelings fester or go unsupported? \n\nI wonder if it\u2019s the decision not to include him that stings, or a perception that he wasn\u2019t even considered at all? I think that\u2019s worse\u2026that no one might have even wondered for a moment about his role or how he would feel? That he was so unimportant in the family that he didn\u2019t even warrant a moment\u2019s thought.\n\nMaybe the OP could have asked if there was a place for the step dad in the ceremony, even if it wasn\u2019t walking down the aisle. She could still do that. Daughter might say no thanks. But at least stepdad could feel like he was considered.\n\nAnd daughter could choose to kindly acknowledge this too. She could speak to the step dad and say \u201cI know you\u2019re probably really disappointed not to be doing x and y. I\u2019ve always had in my mind that my mum would do those things. I\u2019m sorry if that\u2019s hurt your feelings but you\u2019re still an important part of my family\u201d.\n\nWhy? Not out of some patriarchal necessity or duty. Just because it\u2019s good to treat the people in your life with compassion and respect. And it does seem that he\u2019s been compassionate and respectful to the daughter and her siblings.", " He may be a father figure but he is not her father and never will be. Harsh but true. It's her choice and he needs to respect that. \n\nMy bio dad isn't in the picture and I've said that I want my mom to walk me down the aisle. She's been in a wonderful relationship with a great guy for over 10 years; he's been way more of a father to me. But, there's just something inside and it can't be explained.", "Nta but I think you and husband need to attend couples therapy to deal with this. He needs to find a way to accept that he isn't their dad and hs doesn't get to act in that capacity just because thats what he wants. He should also attend individual therapy, but that might take some persuasion.", "NTA!", "NTA at all -he is not her father and you are giving your daughter what she wants. Honestly if you tried any of the things your husband is suggesting would have had a strong negative effect on your relationship with your daughter.", "NTA. His entitlement knows no bounds! It\u2019s great that he feels so involved in your children\u2019s lives and it\u2019s lovely that he wants to be there, but ultimately, you\u2019re her mother and you faced a horrible time together. This would have created a bond that your husband couldn\u2019t understand. Also, it\u2019s your daughters wedding, she gets to choose!", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA 100 percent.", "It\u2019s not the daughter\u2019s fault. It\u2019s the mom.", "Your husband's sexist assumptions make me uncomfortable. NTA.", "I hate the tradition of women being \u201cgiven away\u201d as property.  She didn\u2019t choose a random uncle or cousin, she chose HER MOM. That stepdad expects a role she has chosen her mom to fill is about him.  I am a stepmom, BTW.", "Is this for real? I can\u2019t even imagine that any normal person would respond the way he did. NTA but you are married to one.", "NTA. Instead of being happy for you, he is making it about himself. Try not to let his self pity and bad attitude ruin this happy occasion.", "He has every right to feel disappointed that she doesn\u2019t consider him a father, but he has to honor her wishes.  You did the right thing accepting her request immediately.  NTA", "NTA he may have wanted to do this but your daughter, as the bride, chooses differently. He is not owed this and him trying to diminish your joy is not a good look.", "NTA. Your husband is so wrong to expect that he will be walking her down the aisle. He should have never mentioned that unless she specifically asked him to do so. Just because she didn't ask doesn't mean that she doesn't respect him or sees him as a \"less\". There is just a special bond between you and her, and he should understand that.", "NTA. It's totally understandable that your husband is hurt but having hurt feelings doesn't mean anyone was an asshole to him. Like sometimes people who care about each other hurt each other - it's part of having human relationships", "NTA. He has the right to feel disappointed but not the right to be an AH about it. It's her choice.", "NTA, is what it is, she made things clear and he should respect that and the decision, and shouldn't be upset with you for accepting it. However, he was probably just hoping that after all these years y'all would love him a bit more. I hope he hasn't spent too much energy on your fam tbh, would be depressing.", "We don\u2019t know everything he has done. Raising two kids that are not yours is a huge deal! You give up A LOT of finances, time, energy and emotions. I can see how his feelings were hurt\u2026 but did he really nurture close relationship with these kids?", "This is the price us step fathers pay to raise other peoples children. I am a step father. My step daughter got married 3 years ago. She had her worthless abusive sperm donor walk her down the aisle just so it didn\u2019t cause turmoil. She never talks to him and doesn\u2019t have a relationship with him at all. But step dads are never considered real dads unless something needs to be paid for. Don\u2019t be one bit surprised if your husband refuses to pay for anything for her wedding! And I wouldn\u2019t blame him one bit! No YOU\u2019RE NOT THE A-HOLE! But your daughter is! This will cement in his mind where he stands in that family. He is nothing but a financial support animal!\n \nOn thing to add to this. Don\u2019t be surprised if this puts a giant wedge in your relationship. He is feeling the same betrayal as all step dads do. We\u2019re noting to anyone in the family. We\u2019re the outcast who just pays for lot of the nice stuff you have. He will never look at your daughter in the same way either. He\u2019s had enough of being slapped in the face. I know becasue I have been right where he Is now. Good luck surviving this one. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to end well for either you or your daughter.", "I wished the conversation was had with the stepfather sooner even at the daughter\u2019s age of 15. I think an open dialogue would have smoothed this over years ago. I can see why people don\u2019t want to marry others with kids. You are expected to love your bonus kids as your own but in situations like this, your feelings are disregarded. The stepfather is entitled to his feelings but the mom is not the asshole. Lack of communication is the problem", "He shouldn\u2019t go to the wedding\u2026. The wedding is for the daughter and mother, not him being the AD husband. He should book himself a nice little vacation and enjoy his own time by himself, by supporting himself mentally.", "He needs to be included in something. Not the same situation but when my Dad remarried even though I was in my early twenties, my Mom had died, hurt me forever that I was not included in anything at their wedding I have one picture with the 3 of us.", "NAH. Your daughter doesn't give a shit about your husband. That's not your fault. But it is pretty sad. It's stories like these that make me never want to be a step parent. I can only imagine what a miserable life that must be, having to love and raise children who will never care about you. Always being an outsider no matter what you do. Your husband has the right to be upset by all this.", "NAH. I absolutely understand the heartbreak of your situation. My uncle passed when his girls were 10 and 12. Their mom remarried about 18 months later. Her husband has been amazingly respectful of his place in their family. He said in the beginning he would be as little or as much as needed and he's been just that. I think the man is a saint. I say all that to say this...have Grace for your husband and ask him to have Grace for the situation as well. \n\nIf you and your husband have never been to marriage counseling, you need to. Quickly. \n\nI absolutely understand your need for certain aspects of your marriage to be 100% your way, such as him respecting he wasn't a father to them. BUT...that doesn't mean that he doesn't have feelings. Right or wrong, valid or invalid, understandable or unreasonable, he has feelings. Being able to express those feelings and be heard, even if you ultimately don't agree with him, is crucial.\n\nWhile he absolutely agreed to certain stipulations, to marry you, that doesn't mean that his feelings on the issue can never change. \n\nThose issues and more should be discussed in a safe setting with a professional between you and your husband. Of course, that's provided that you want to make things work. \n\nYou could just tell him that he agreed to all this and to suck it up and stop being an AH. If that's your gut instinct, do it. It will hurt and may ultimately end your marriage, but if that's how you feel, you shouldn't be married.\n\nOr you can accept that while he isn't her father and he never acted as her father, he has been an important presence in her daily life. You can accept that, from your own description, he has been patient and respectful of your and your children's wishes. It doesn't sound as if that respect has been returned.  It doesn't sound as if he's ultimately upset at not being asked...he's hurt because he feels discounted and overlooked. That would hurt anyone. \n\nYour situation is a difficult one. I absolutely don't think anyone is trying to be an AH to anyone else. I think it's just a really fucking hard situation. I'm so sorry y'all are faced with it and I hope y'all can work it out. Y'all both sound like you're good people who are both trying.", "NTA because it is your daughter's decision.\n\nI do feel for him, though. I see that people here are calling him selfish and thinking of himself and that he knew what he was walking into and all that - but he's been in her life since she was 10. I don't know in what capacity - but I'm assuming that he took on at least **some** parental roles. He saw himself as part of a family. A step parent doesn't take the place of biological parent, but they do play a role of some kind. I feel that more than he's acting selfish - he's telling OP that he is heartbroken that after all these years he's not seen as more than \"mom's partner\".\n\nI think OP should talk and listen to him. And I actually would bring this up to Calla in a very careful way. Not that he should be \"in place of\" her mother (or her father). But in his own place - maybe he walks down the aisle with mom. Maybe you do a mother/daughter dance AND a father /daughter dance. Or something. He obviously wants to be part of this, and unless there is some underlying abuse, why isn't he recognized?\n\nLook I've been in and seen my fair share of blended /step families. It can be beautiful and it can be challenging. There are ways to make it work so that everyone feels accepted and nobody feels left out.", "NTA. Sounds like your daughter has a good relationship with your now husband but she\u2019s been wanting you to walk her down the aisle/first dance since forever. And she hasn\u2019t changed her mind. Let her do whatever she wants. Losing a dad that young is tough enough. All you can do is support her. \n\nAs for your current husband, I assume has not said anything to your daughter about his feelings. And he should keep it that way. You however can talk more with him to help him through his own hurt. I would even suggest therapy for him. Once he\u2019s calmed down and shows that he\u2019s more accepting and mature about this whole thing, then maybe you can ask your daughter if she\u2019s open to doing something at the wedding for your current husband - maybe he gets his own song, or let him do one of the toasts, or include him in a slide show? \n\nWhile your daughter gets to choose what she wants/don\u2019t want for her wedding, she\u2019s also young and might not have even considered others\u2019 feelings. I got married that young as well and there were so many things I didn\u2019t consider and was grateful my mom was there to make suggestions - like, I had really old relatives coming from a long ways and it would have been nice to acknowledge their efforts during my rehearsal dinner speech. It was something small and easy to do on my part, but it made my old relatives feel really welcomed and appreciated. \n\nEveryone just wants to celebrate this happy event together and while your husband may not have approached it in the most mature way, he can\u2019t help how he feels. \n\nGood luck and congrats!", "There is a sad reality that many step parents often do every bit as much for a child as the biological parent did but receive no respect or even thanks for all the time, money, emotions and just hard work they put in. Imagine having a job where you go to work everyday, give it your all and yet only the person in the stall next to you gets thanked .... It bloody sucks.\n\nHow do you express to your husband how grateful you are for him taking on a responsibility that he is not appreciated for doing? How do your son and daughter express their gratitude for what he has done for them? It okay not to see his as their father, it is not okay to not recognise his contribution.", "I have read most of the comments here and I disagree.\n\nHis feelings have been hurt. He has tried, from what I have read. Not made some weird thing about \"\"I am the Daddy now.\" He has been respectful of everyone's feelings and tried to be positive. And when the time came...he was ignored.\n\nIt's been a decade. He has been there every step of the way for that entire time.\n\nYeah. You hurt him.", "Info:  Your husband sounds heartbroken that your daughter doesn't view him as a parent.  Did you two have a conversation on his feelings at all?", "NTA however, I can see where he is coming from. He has nurtured, worked hard to feed and cloth your children, and he may see her more of a daughter than she does him as a father.\n\n10 is a young age. However, by the age of 10, a child's personality has already developed and formed. Therefore, he may not have had a lifelong impact on her as she has had to him, especially if he doesn't have any children of his own and when you first got together it was his first exposure to bringing up children. If he loves her truly as a daughter and is emotionally connected to her, then it's understandable why he is heartbroken.\n\nUltimately, you're NTA and neither is your daughter. Maybe his expectations weren't managed throughout the time you have been a family.", "NTA, my best friend had her mother walk her down the aisle, even though her father was alive and well.  She also did not invite him to her wedding although she has some contact with him now.  Her parents are divorced.  Bride's choice on this is correct.  I feel a bit sad for your hsband, but it is not like you promised him an insta family - your kids were clear from the start he would never replace their father.  Why is he mad at them for being consistent?", "Honestly sounds like neither one of you give a fuck about him but that's his problem. Nta", "Not for anything that's happened on the last 20years but those names! Yes you are for that!\n\nIt's a disgrace, what took place, it's a disgrace", "NTA. I don't don't blame him for having feelings about it, but his view sounds quite a bit transactional. It's not a reward for services rendered! It's also not something you have any right to barter over. Also his view that as his wife you should be putting his notions of respect for him over your daughter's feelings over her own wedding is more than a little gross.\n\nIt has to feel right to her, and you doing it in her dad's absence is a lovely gesture. I would have said I'm sure she isn't doing it *at* him, and she might not, but your last paragraph makes me wonder whether she isn't picking up entitlement vibes she isn't going with - and good for her.", "NTA. The only thing that matters here are the wishes of the bride. This is an agreement OP and daughter have had for a long time and neither one is doing anything wrong by sticking to the plan.\n\nHusband is hurt and is being selfish as a result.

There's always people in our lives that we don't consider a parental or family figure but are still considered someone special.\nBut also we don't know the family dynamic or how he treated the kids.

In fact I specifically say that it's fine not to view them as a father figure.

You sound heartless. Who hurt you so badly for you to think this way?", "The fact that he's upset OP didn't push for her daughter to add him doesn\u2019t sit quite right with me. If ego didn't have anything to do with it - and I'm not saying he wasn't genuinely hurt or that he didn't have a right to be hurt - it seems to me that OP pushing wouldn't even have been something he'd want because it wouldn't have changed how the daughter felt.

Your kids don't exist to parrot your beliefs and tell you that you're great.", "It's ridiculous lol I wouldn't say OP is an AH but I can understand why the step father would be hurt.

What I mean to say is that I am shocked with myself that I have an opinion that differs so much from the consensus here. With that in mind I do not know if this will be helpful, and I am probably wrong about something here, but I'll make a case of YTA just to try and describe a different perspective.\n\nIt absolutely makes sense that you two were excited but it sounds like he pretty gently prodded about why he wasn't even considered. And the answer, from his perspective, seems to just be... you aren't part of the family. It would've been much better to lean in to the promise when she was 15. That would've made it about upholding a promise instead of this seemingly strange diminishment of his role as a father for the past 12 years. Let me give my perspective on how this potentially makes him feel, but please don't take any of this to heart-- it's just a thought exercise to try and help frame my overall point.\n\nHe has been there for 12 years and will be for more to come? He has technically been there for her as longer than her first father was, albeit no fault of his obviously. But not ever considering him father figure because of something he said to console 12 year olds... For me, this is just... cruel. I mean good God, what were all those years for? Will he never be part of the family? Is he just a paycheck for the family? If it's really about being reminded of her first father, why is he even invited to the wedding?\n\nNow again I want to be clear that I am not saying that any of those things are definitely true. I am trying to paint a picture of what kind of feelings your husband may be going through right now. Those would all be completely normal, appropriate feelings. I simply do not know you all well enough to help make this judgement call. But I can easily see this being a situation of this man effectively being told he is not really part of the family after 12 years, and I was just surprised that no one is discussing that very real possibility in the comments.\n\nOne common sentiment I am seeing that I will strongly assert is wrong is that he is \"not the father .\" I do not care what the comments say, he has been there for 12 years, he is their father. Their second father, but a father. Be leery of the maturity levels of people saying otherwise, even children's cartoons explore more complex family topics than that. I mean seriously, the lack of life experience shown in that opinion but asserted so confidently is baffling to a well adjusted adult. \n\nAnother sentiment I am seeing is that he is not paying for the wedding, so his opinion does not matter. The sheer premise of that is strange to me. Who is paying for the wedding? Who makes the money in the house? Do you not consider each other's money as joint assets?\n\nMy final major concern is that it does not sound like therapy appropriately addressed the grief and feelings from the death of their first father. It is very normal to understand and accept that you have two fathers. Especially when it happened so young. Trauma affects everyone differently so of course this may truly be normal for you all, but I'm not seeing or reading the foundational ideals I would expect to see from someone who's been through that kind of therapy. I cannot imagine a therapist encouraging you to make lifelong promises in the manner described in this post. And please note, any kind of religious counselor is not a therapist-- I have seen that happen a lot too.\n\nI absolutely, sincerely hope that this comment doesn't cause undue grief for you. It is more about my own confusion than a critique of you or your daughter. I am simply trying to describe that confusion because I could see your husband sharing the same confusion.", "So he\u2019s never going to be considered a \u201creal\u201d part of the family because met OP second?

But even though he wasn't my dad he was 100% a parent, he drove me to games, took off time if I was sick, helped me with homework, disciplined me, encouraged me, paid for my college, loved me when I was nice and loved me when I was a brat just the same. He walked me down the aisle with my mom at my wedding and he had the honor of the father daughter dance, and I really feel like to do otherwise would have been a slap in his face (especially if I had chosen to just honor my mother). I had our ketubah modfied to list all three of my parents (dad, mom, step-dad). I think every step parent/kid relationship is different, so it is hard to judge anyone too harshly with the info given, but IMO the mother should be doing something to encourage a small honoring of the step-father, even if it isn't on the magnitude of a father/daughter dance or walking down the aisle. People in the comments saying \"it is about the couple getting married\", which is mostly true, but if you are actively choosing to honor some parents heavily and ignore others entirely (barring being a shitty parent) I think that's off.
