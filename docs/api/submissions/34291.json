This is a throwaway account because my fiance knows my reddit. I'm also on mobile so yea all that obligatory stuff.\n\nFor a little intro my Fiance(M27 white) and I (F24 Black) have been engaged for a year and together for 5, and yes before you ask the races will become important. I have one child that is not his biologically (F7) but that is still her daddy and she calls him as such. He loves her like his own and it's honestly been such a blessing and so endearing to watch. We also have a daughter together (F3). And a bundle of joy on the way! \n\nSo over the Christmas stretch while everyone was home, me and my fiance, Ryan decided to have a get together at our home. All together it was his 2 siblings, my 3 siblings, his nephew both of my parents and his mother so 9 guest plus our family of 4. Our families love eachother and get along wonderfully except for hie mother. This story pretty much just involves his mom who I will call MIL. \n\nThe family gets together on the 26th  and is having a pretty good time. My brother pulled me to the side and told me that MIL had made a couple of racist comments towards him ans my parents and also started questioning why \"our people\" would get so offended by the n-word. I told him I'd handle it later but I did not want to spoil the party. About an hour later things have picked back up and my MIL is playing with my oldest and I hear her say \"oh don't you wish that you had hair like (3y/o) and not some heavy braids\" and before I could get there saying \"you look like your mommy but would be prettier if you had skin like daddy and (3 y/o)\" now, my oldest looks like me with pretty dark skin. While my youngest looks exactly like her father...and honestly dosent even look mixed. \n\nWhen I heard these comments I saw RED I took my kids and nephew up to the playroom came back down and told MIL to get \"the hell out of my house and never come back\" when my fiance heard the commotion and I told him what happened he was LIVID we kicked my mother in law out without much fight back from her. I apologized to both families and they said it wasnr my fault and understood and we continued to have a great time.\n\nFor the past week my MIL has been blasting me on evert social media platform saying im a bitch and everything under the sun. Mt FH has been completely on my side and we sent her a message together about her not being able to see the children anymore and she's blasted and calling me a horrible mother and threatening me. FH father and one brother are angry with me but otherwise people are mostly on my side om starring to think I went a little overboard with everything. And feel bad about my kids not seeing her anymore espically with a new baby on rhe way.

Especially those girls. The moment you sway she will think she\u2019s done no wrong at all & you\u2019ll never get this opportunity again. She will continue these nasty comments to the girls forever. Your oldest nor youngest for that matter deserves to hear those nasty things. \n\nNo telling what those comments would create i those girls. Stop it now. And thank goodness your Fianc\u00e9 is backing you 100% in this!", "NTA. Racism is not OK and should never be tolerated, but it could be especially harmful to your children since they have different skin tones, because they will notice being treated differently. That being said, if your husband isn't backing you up on this fully you've got a much bigger problem to deal with.", "NTA. Your children should never be subjected to that from her or anybody.", "NTA keep that woman away from your family. She's already trying to turn your kids against each other. I'd wager to say she's already caused damage that you will need to address with your children.  \n\nIf she is threatening you keep the messages and posts and pursue legal action at least a restraining order if not more depending on what you and your husband decide. \n\nBest of luck, protect your wonderful little girls it's a nasty world out there unfortunately.", "NTA. This is a hill worth defending. Not only is your FMIL's racism not acceptable, but what she said to your oldest is the kind of thing that directly attacks a child's self-esteem (racist or not). Comment like that should not be allowed around your children.\n\nThe fact that she is taking this fight public, when it doesn't need to be, is a sign that she knows that a) she is in the wrong and b) she can't win on the merits of her own case. Basically, she is trying to win via peer pressure via both false outrage and by organizing the other racists she knows against you.\n\nOne thing about this - you now know who the good people are in your life - they are the ones who are on your side. The ones taking FMIL's side are the ones you need to cut out of your life.", "NTA - racism should never be tolerated. PERIOD.", "NTA, what a disgusting person. Don\u2019t give her a second thought.", "NTA\nYour fianc\u00e9 is a good man! Anyone who says you were out of line has never had to face racism as you have. In no way were you wrong. You took all the kids away from the situation and then kicked her out. As a parent it\u2019s your job to protect your kids from harm even if the harm is from a grandparent/ family member.", "NTA. And even if it wasn't racism (say, just different fenotypes of same race) you'd still be NTA. No one should be allowed to blatantly plant insecurities into children.", "I am a white woman, and I have a mixed race child with a black man. If my mother said anything like that to my child, I would rip her a new hole. AND she would never see me or my family ever again. Please stand your ground. You have to protect your children and yourself.", "NTA. Unless she comes crawling back, and apologizes profusely, do not let her back into your family life. Her behaviour is horribly racist and I can't even begin to imagine how she could justify such comments. I would be irritated if my mother or MIL said something like this about either of my caucasian kids, suggesting one parent or one kid had advantageous looks over the other parent or kid. You being livid is absolutely understandable. Glad your man was with you in booting her out and such.", "NTA, and keep that racist AH away from your family. You're doing both well and good.", "NTA. I am impressed you managed to keep your emotions in check to handle the situation. I'm so pissed of just reading it I'm sweating.\n\nI can't say more without violating rules.\n\nHope you find the peace and love you and family need.", "NTA\n\nGrandma doesn\u2019t not get to stay decidedly racist things and not expect consequences. \n\nI hope she learns from the experience and earns your trust. But it is HER that needs to put in the work, not you.", "NTA.  It's hard to believe that there are really people like your FMIL in this world.  I'm afraid someone like that will always be difficult to deal with as her behavior is almost irrational (as most prejudices are).  I'm glad you and your fianc\u00e9 are on the same page with no reservations.  It's clear you will never be able to trust her entirely with your children if she clings to being right for talking to your daughter like this.  You didn't go overboard but how you choose to handle things going forward might include a second chance for her IF she is willing to talk to you about what happened and assure you she won't be comparing your children like that ever again. Wish I could say I felt some confidence in a good resolution here but, sadly, I really don't.  For her to be able to talk this way to your children in your home with your family present totally shows the depth and ignorance of her prejudice.  She's likely clueless.", "MIL needs to learn how to keep her mouth shut. Ain't nobody got time for racist BS at a family gathering. You did the right thing by kicking her out and protecting your kids from that toxicity. NTA, don't let anyone make you feel bad about standing up for what's right.", "I wouldn't let this person around my child.\n\nNTA", "NTA she should have NEVER said those things, \u201cif you do not have anything nice to say then don\u2019t say anything\u201d\u2026 that simple her opinion should have been left to herself. She over stepped and honestly it disgusting behavior to say things to an adult and then try to make a child feel bad about themselves is disgusting and I would NEVER be ok with that. You nipped it in the butt and set boundaries! Good for you!", "If people are coming at you for cutting MIL off from the kids, TELL. THEM. EXACTLY. WHAT. SHE. SAID. She was saying abhorrently racist things to the kids and they deserve to be protected from her. You are in no way the AH, but MIL sure as HELL is.

As far as racism goes this is about as bad as it gets get.", "NTA. What you'll put up with now is what your children are going to have to endure for their entire lives with this woman.

Good luck.", "Yikes, sounds like your MIL really crossed a line there. Can't blame you for wanting to protect your kids from that toxicity. But maybe talk it out with your husband and see if y'all can come up with a game plan to address the situation? Just my two cents though, do what's best for you and yours!", "NTA and you should hop over to JustNoMIL, you will fit right in.", "OP, I just want to say what a great mom you are. I remember what adults said about my skin/hair/looks when I was seven. Minor judgements can be devastating, and what FMIL said is horrific and abusive. NTA", "A lot of people have something I would like to call 'child guilt' where they feel guilty for removing an obstacle within their life. Because that obstacle is perceived as something their children will need. \n\nYour children only need YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND. There is no other factor, and there is no other equation that your children need. Your children need food and clothes YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND provide. They need you to be healthy. They need you to be strong, and they need you to be sound of mine. \n\nThey do NOT need your mother-in-law.  \n\nAnd that being said, you are a 100% right for kicking her out. I personally am in a mixed relationship where I am the black one.  And I already let him know that I can tolerate being disliked for a perception (based off stereotypes at that) but it ends with me. Our children will never experience that. \n\nShe doesn't want to fix your relationship, so the question is, why are you trying to fix the relationship?  The very moment that somebody in your life decides that they no longer want to be a positive influence in your life- you need to cut that person off. That person is no longer a benefit to you. The very fact that she went on social media and was posting blatant lies about how the situation is means that she wants to have her pity party and the socials are the blind leading the blind. \n\nYou're having a child- the very last thing you need on top of that is stress and even though you feel, as if this is giving you stress, you know what would give you even more stress? Her being there to degrade, undermine, and be racist to you.", "NTA and if you start to doubt yourself check out the stories about racist grandmas on here where they take toddlers to get their hair relaxed.", "yta let the racist be around your black kids\n\n\nIs that what you expected to hear? What's there to be conflicted about? NTA", "Is this even a true story? Like, why are you asking if you're the asshole for kicking a racist out of your house? \n\n  \nDoesn't pass the smell test.", "NTA.  What a horrible, asinine miserable woman she is.  You are absolutely justified in throwing her out and never letting her around your kids or your family.", "No you didn\u2019t go overboard. I\u2019m a white person so take this with a grain of salt. Black people have experienced systemic racism for so long, it\u2019s no wonder you\u2019d feel you\u2019re over reacting. You\u2019re not. You and your kids deserve respect in general and especially from family. Your fianc\u00e9 sounds fantastic. Wish your family a bright and happy today and all your tomorrows.", "I never understand when people say they feel bad for shutting obvious bullshit down, like why? Do you feel bad for swatting the mosquito that just bit you? Guilt is reserved for questionable behavior towards people who didn't really deserve it. Your FMIL deserved what she got and then some. Tighten up your spine. NTA.", "Oh definitely NTA.\n\nImagine what she\u2019s been saying and will say when NO ONE ELSE is around?? She\u2019s already a disaster, and hasn\u2019t even apologized. Keep your family safe!", "NTA. Do NOT subject your children, especially the oldest, to that woman anymore. If you let this slide you will be sending a message that her behavior & beliefs are acceptable.  Racism is not something you compromise on and that's not a pattern you want to start.", "NTA. \n\nShe\u2019s dangerous.  \n\nWhat she said to your oldest has the potential to rob her of a lifetime of joy about looking like her mother, having dark skin and hair different than her sister.  And this is just what you heard, this time! She could be spouting this nonsense and you\u2019d have no idea. I would never ever let this woman see my kids unsupervised. \n\nYour daughter is going to experience a lot of racist crap. She should never have to experience that in her own home.", "Nta, put her exact words on the socials she targetting you on. Let people see what she will say to unattended children amd show her that she's the problem.", "NTA OMG!! I am so sorry for what she did to you and what she said to your babies!! OMG!! I just cant even, I just cant imagine what kind of evil is inside a person who does that kind of thing. Now she's threatening you?

I cant even think straight, I am so sorry!!", "NTA she doesn't belong around children at all. Or anyone, really.
