I have one child that is not his biologically (F7) but that is still her daddy and she calls him as such. He loves her like his own and it's honestly been such a blessing and so endearing to watch. We also have a daughter together (F3). And a bundle of joy on the way! \n\nSo over the Christmas stretch while everyone was home, me and my fiance, Ryan decided to have a get together at our home. All together it was his 2 siblings, my 3 siblings, his nephew both of my parents and his mother so 9 guest plus our family of 4. Our families love eachother and get along wonderfully except for hie mother. This story pretty much just involves his mom who I will call MIL. \n\nThe family gets together on the 26th  and is having a pretty good time. My brother pulled me to the side and told me that MIL had made a couple of racist comments towards him ans my parents and also started questioning why \"our people\" would get so offended by the n-word. I told him I'd handle it later but I did not want to spoil the party. About an hour later things have picked back up and my MIL is playing with my oldest and I hear her say \"oh don't you wish that you had hair like (3y/o) and not some heavy braids\" and before I could get there saying \"you look like your mommy but would be prettier if you had skin like daddy and (3 y/o)\" now, my oldest looks like me with pretty dark skin. While my youngest looks exactly like her father...and honestly dosent even look mixed. \n\nWhen I heard these comments I saw RED I took my kids and nephew up to the playroom came back down and told MIL to get \"the hell out of my house and never come back\" when my fiance heard the commotion and I told him what happened he was LIVID we kicked my mother in law out without much fight back from her. I apologized to both families and they said it wasnr my fault and understood and we continued to have a great time.\n\nFor the past week my MIL has been blasting me on evert social media platform saying im a bitch and everything under the sun. Mt FH has been completely on my side and we sent her a message together about her not being able to see the children anymore and she's blasted and calling me a horrible mother and threatening me. FH father and one brother are angry with me but otherwise people are mostly on my side om starring to think I went a little overboard with everything.

Your oldest nor youngest for that matter deserves to hear those nasty things. \n\nNo telling what those comments would create i those girls. Stop it now. And thank goodness your Fianc\u00e9 is backing you 100% in this!", "NTA. Racism is not OK and should never be tolerated, but it could be especially harmful to your children since they have different skin tones, because they will notice being treated differently. That being said, if your husband isn't backing you up on this fully you've got a much bigger problem to deal with.", "NTA. Your children should never be subjected to that from her or anybody.", "NTA keep that woman away from your family. She's already trying to turn your kids against each other. I'd wager to say she's already caused damage that you will need to address with your children.  \n\nIf she is threatening you keep the messages and posts and pursue legal action at least a restraining order if not more depending on what you and your husband decide. \n\nBest of luck, protect your wonderful little girls it's a nasty world out there unfortunately.", "NTA. This is a hill worth defending. Not only is your FMIL's racism not acceptable, but what she said to your oldest is the kind of thing that directly attacks a child's self-esteem (racist or not). Comment like that should not be allowed around your children.\n\nThe fact that she is taking this fight public, when it doesn't need to be, is a sign that she knows that a) she is in the wrong and b) she can't win on the merits of her own case. Basically, she is trying to win via peer pressure via both false outrage and by organizing the other racists she knows against you.\n\nOne thing about this - you now know who the good people are in your life - they are the ones who are on your side.

Her behaviour is horribly racist and I can't even begin to imagine how she could justify such comments. I would be irritated if my mother or MIL said something like this about either of my caucasian kids, suggesting one parent or one kid had advantageous looks over the other parent or kid.

But it is HER that needs to put in the work, not you.", "NTA.  It's hard to believe that there are really people like your FMIL in this world.  I'm afraid someone like that will always be difficult to deal with as her behavior is almost irrational (as most prejudices are).  I'm glad you and your fianc\u00e9 are on the same page with no reservations.  It's clear you will never be able to trust her entirely with your children if she clings to being right for talking to your daughter like this.  You didn't go overboard but how you choose to handle things going forward might include a second chance for her IF she is willing to talk to you about what happened and assure you she won't be comparing your children like that ever again. Wish I could say I felt some confidence in a good resolution here but, sadly, I really don't.  For her to be able to talk this way to your children in your home with your family present totally shows the depth and ignorance of her prejudice.  She's likely clueless.", "MIL needs to learn how to keep her mouth shut. Ain't nobody got time for racist BS at a family gathering.

The very moment that somebody in your life decides that they no longer want to be a positive influence in your life- you need to cut that person off. That person is no longer a benefit to you. The very fact that she went on social media and was posting blatant lies about how the situation is means that she wants to have her pity party and the socials are the blind leading the blind. \n\nYou're having a child- the very last thing you need on top of that is stress and even though you feel, as if this is giving you stress, you know what would give you even more stress?

Racism is unacceptable, racism against children is extra hideous, and racist comments comparing siblings is an instant ticket straight to hell. MIL could seriously damage your oldest daughter by saying she\u2019d be \u201cprettier\u201d if she had lighter skin and such comments could also easily destroy the kids\u2019 relationships with each other.\n\nIf (and it\u2019s a big if) MIL (and FIL and BIL who think this was okay) issues a full and sincere apology you might consider letting her have supervised visits, maybe. That\u2019s far more than she deserves. Really, what kind of monster says that crap to anyone, let alone a child?", "NTA. Document the threats in case you need to get police involved.", "NTA. She's racist and also wrong about you being a \"horrible mother.\" You're a damn good one for protecting your kids from someone like her (and your fiance is a good dad, too, for the same reason). They don't need to be subjected to someone like your MIL.", "INFO : Why would people feel bad for your kids not seeing her anymore as she was hurting your oldest with her racial slurs?\n\nShe's a RACIST. ( *MIL had made a couple of racist comments towards him ans my parents and also started questioning why \"our people\" would get so offended by the n-word.* )\n\nNTA\n\nYou keep protecting your family.", "NTA you are completely right. For the love of all that\u2019s holy do not let this woman or anyone defending her near your children. She believes everything she said and has doubled down!!! She has told you who she is believe her.", "Sis, you are so NTA.\n\nYWBTA if you ever brought your children around your MIL again.  Throw his entire family out too, actually.  FIL and brother sound toxic af.  Do you even know what they have been and will be saying to your kids when you\u2019re not around?  I guarantee you this won\u2019t be the first time racist comments from your in-laws will be heard by your children.\n\nAnd if at any point in the future your significant other shows ANY favoritism towards his white-passing or lighter children or any other bs (because let\u2019s face it, if his mom is a racist, he has some indoctrination he might not even be aware of) then you need to set him straight with the quickness and get y\u2019all some family therapy.\n\nThis is why I can\u2019t date anyone who\u2019s not Black or insanely over-the-top antiracist left-wing.  Never again.  I have too much trauma.\n\nYour poor children are gonna need therapy because colorism, internalized racism, and misogynoir are HUGE even among monoracial Black families.\n\nUgh.  I don\u2019t even have to ask.  This is America.\n\n!Update me.", "NTA- You're a 100% in the right. That was downright evil of her to say things like that. And in such an innocuous way. To a children! Just to create self doubt in them....yea. You did the right thing. Also its great that there is no doubt with your ~~husband~~ erm, fiance. You marry the man, not the family. MIL can pound racist sand.\n\nIf it comes to it, I just recommend being gracious in victory if at all possible.", "NTA.  She's a racist.  You don't want her forcing her racism on your children.  You are rightfully protecting them.", "NTA. If you take any mention of race out of what she said, it\u2019s still unhinged. Who the fuck tells a 7 year old they\u2019d be prettier if they looked like other people in the family? That\u2019s incredibly mean no matter the races.", "Do you really feel bad about protecting your kid?\n\nNEVER feel bad about protecting your child from people who will hurt them nd make them have mental issues and insecurities. \n\nThis woman is a real danger to your child's emotional wellbeing. New baby-- if this baby looks more like you, do you think she will not be horrible to the baby and to you?", "NTA racism is Never ok and you stood your ground and stood up for your daughter.", "# I commented already but I just read you story again.  YTA for not handling her when your BLACK brother said MIL was racist towards them and your BLACK mother and father.\n\n# You only started caring when MIL insulted your children.  And now you\u2019re second-guessing yourself for kicking her out?  Over racism?!\n\n# Grow a spine, sis.  YTA for not dealing with MIL at the first hint of racism, which I am pretty sure was not at this event.", "Her fiance is on her side. It's his father that is angry at her", "IMO, it\u2019s not even the racial issues that\u2019s a problem. \n\nIf someone told a child that they\u2019d look much prettier if they had a different shape nose or eye color it would still be hurtful. You\u2019re telling the kid flat out that they\u2019re unattractive. \n\nThats the core issue. The racial aspect just aggravates it further.", "her fianc\u00e9e is backing her fully.", "That was my comment as well.  Don\u2019t let her control narrative.", "Because people are never this racist in real life, right?", "I agree. She will not change. She\u2019ll continue to think\u2014and say\u2014those horrible things, probably just not where an adult will hear them.      \nDo not allow her near your children.\nNTA.", "Directed at a child it's all abuse.", "Who's maybe so emotionally terrorized he just wants things smoothed over so he doesn't have to deal with the awful person he married throwing her crybully tantrum.  This is a him problem, not OPs of course.", "Welcome to my world lol. Non-white cultures idealize white beauty standards so much they cause physical and emotional pain on kids who don\u2019t miraculously turn out pale-skinned with round eyes and a \u201cnot flat\u201d nose.", "Hard agree"]}
