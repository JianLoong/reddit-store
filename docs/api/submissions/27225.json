Plan a few family outings and tell they them can come if they can put their differences aside and have a nice time at the outings. Tell them how it's affected you and how at the end of the day, life is short, so they should let bygones be bygones and try to be a family.", "NTA.  Unless the two brothers commit to some sort of reconciliation BEFORE the wedding day, that is not the proper venue for them to reunite.  Especially if just the prospect of them being there at the same time is causing drama months ahead of time.", "NTA\n\nAm I correct in that this feud started when the parties were 19 and 17 and got into a fight?  That is is some *literal* teenage drama spilling over into adulthood?  I'm with you 100%.

But I get where you're coming from. Why deal with all the stress to begin with when you can just have a day about the two of you instead of about the big feud?\n\nHere is a suggestion. Perhaps you can tell them that you will invite them if they organize a get together without you present where they calmly discuss how they will behave at the wedding. And if it all goes down drama free, then you will invite them all. But otherwise, you don't want to deal with the added complications.", "NTA.

Let alone trying to deal with that when you have a wedding to plan.\n\nIf they come around on their own and all is good in time for you to add them to the list, fine, maybe, if you want and you are sure it won't be a problem. Mediating that conflict 7 years later to see if they can behave to attend your wedding?? Nahh.", "Tentative NTA. I'm curious what the fight was about because sometimes you do need to stay neutral and other times you should choose someone (like for bigotry, someone being incredibly vile, etc.) \n\nBut if the fight wasn't something that one party should be admonished for 7 years on, it is understandable that you don't want to invite drama into your wedding. \n\nThough I do think you should have set up boundaries with each brother and your SIL way before now, that you don't want to talk about the feud and that them focusing on that when they see you is ruining their relationship with you.", "Trust your instincts and leave them uninvited.  It is your and your future husbands day and you don't need the stress of \"what if\" and \"will they\".

Statistically speaking, it's a coin flip that you will end up divorced, so there's a good chance you'll have another special day, with another love of your life, who you will spend the rest of your life with. Though, of course, second marriages tend to fail far more than first marriages. And the odds of divorcing only go up more as you move through new marriages.

This will be your special day without any worries as to whether people will get along.  Seven years is a long time to not have worked out the issue.  I think you and your future husband's decision to not invite them is a good idea.  I am sure there are those that will be mad at you but you have the right to have the wedding you want.

Obviously I don't know their personalities, but don't rule out inviting them. They both seem like they at least care about you and wouldn't do anything to tarnish your day. At the worst make sure they're seated far away from one another.

That said, you sound like a nice person (congrats on your wedding!) and I worry that you may ultimately regret the decision to exclude them\u2014particularly if both parties have expressed a sincere desire to come and celebrate your day with a promise to be on their best behavior. I\u2019d consider inviting them with some ground rules\u2014namely, if they can\u2019t be civil or nice to one another then they can\u2019t interact. I would also strongly suggest that you request that they not consume any alcohol. A solemn promise to behave coupled with their sobriety gives you a decent chance of having your whole family at a joyous event to celebrate your union without worrying that someone\u2019s going to have one too many and set off a fireworks show. It\u2019s *your* day and the last thing you need to be worrying about is family drama. If your sibs can\u2019t or won\u2019t agree to your conditions, then I\u2019d exclude them with a clear conscience.", "As we've stated in Reddit MANY times, a wedding is not the place for a reconciliation.", ">how at the end of the day, life is short, so they should let bygones be bygones and try to be a family.\n\nI am completely on board with your idea but this verbiage can send the wrong message. It indicates that feelings should be stuffed down and bad behaviors ignored just because \"we're family\" and blood trumps everything. It focuses on pretending things are okay rather than letting people slowly come to a more nuanced neutral relationship.\n\nSometimes families are more peaceful when some members don't interact much with each other.", "Especially if they are now claiming that they will be on their best behavior for the wedding. Well, then why the hell couldn't they do that for ALL the other get-togethers in the last 7 years???", "They don\u2019t want to reconcile though. The point is them tolerating each other for the wedding."]}
