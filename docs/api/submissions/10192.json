Business is very good and I have recently been having a lot of customers requesting for items for their gender reveals. Cakes, cupcakes, cake pops even chocolate covered strawberries etc.\n\nThe customer will give me a piece of paper with the gender of their baby written on it from their doctor, I'll then apply whatever the gender of the baby is to their order. Super simple.\n\nMy older brother and SIL are expecting their fourth child in a few months. They already have 3 boys and have been hoping and praying to finally have a girl.\n\nSo much to the point that they've been telling the entire family they know this baby is going to be a girl, they can \"feel it\". They've already started decorating their nursery to cater to a baby girl. Having already been buying/requesting that family members gift them clothes for a baby girl. They already have a name picked out and everything. Apparently their doctor also told them there a good chance the baby is a girl, but not 100%.\n\nThey asked to make something for their gender reveal, I said of course as I've done their past 3 gender reveals for their boys. Brother comes in to give me the paper with the gender, my staff and I get started on the order and open the note to reveal the gender is a boy...\n\nNow immediately after seeing this note I was thinking to myself \"oh shit\" because I knew that they had already started preparing for a baby girl and that the gender reveal was mainly going to be catered around the baby being a girl (pink balloons and decorations etc).\n\nBut I obviously was not about to tell them this before the gender reveal, because that would ruin it, so I just proceeded as normal and finished their order.\n\nDay of the gender reveal arrives, they decided on a cake, they cut their cake and the inside is of course blue.\n\nSIL immediately starts crying, everyone is just awkwardly silent. My brother calls me out in front of everyone and questions that surely this must be a mistake and not their cake? I confirm with them this is indeed their cake.\n\nSIL starts screaming at me that I embarrassed them in front of the entire family by not giving them a \"heads up\" about the gender. I asked her isn't that the whole point of a gender reveal? Why would I disclose the gender to you and ruin the day.\n\nI told both if them that I'm not the one who decided the gender of the baby, so I'm not sure why their attacking me and it's not my fault they did so much preplanning that it would be a girl.\n\nSIL told me to shut up and started calling me nasty names, I called her and my brother delusional.\n\nSince the baby shower they have been contacting me nonstop for their money back. My SIL's family hates me, my family is trying to stay neutral but thinks i should've given a \"heads up\".", "created_utc": 1676645961, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114n7em/aita_for_disclosing_the_real_gender_of_my_sil_and/", "score": 2356, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he wanted to, he could have looked at it before he gave it to you.\n\nThey just want someone to blame.", "NTA. That poor child. \n\nThey're taking out their very weird disappointment on you. You did nothing wrong. If they had worked themselves into a froth without any real reason to, it's their own fault. They sound like they're still children themselves. That poor child, I feel for him. It's not on you to do this at all, but you seem like a good person... maybe give this nephew a bit of extra attention compared to the others, because it sounds like he won't get it from his parents.", "NTA. This is one of many reasons why gender reveals suck. Imagine that child years from now learning  there mom cried when his gender was revealed. Sorry OP but also your brother sounds like a dumbass", "NTA and your brother and SIL should just be thankful for having healthy kids. I see so many videos online of gender reveals and you can tell when they\u2019re disappointed. How will the child feel watching that when they\u2019re grown up and feel like a disappointment.", "NTA. They blamed the sex of their baby on you? Seriously?", "NTA. \n\nGender reveal parties are adult versions of kids repeating \u201cLook at me!\u201d over and over again.  But even given that low bar, your SIL is behaving like a child.  If she wanted to know, she should have looked.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, your SIL's family are the ones who are AH's here.  They got themselves **heavily** emotionally invested in the baby being a girl before it was certain.\n\nAnd now they're blaming you rather than saying \"Maybe we went way overboard in preparing for a girl.\"\n\nI feel bad for that poor baby boy.  Given how excited they were to see a baby girl, I wonder if the boy is going to be loved less because of his gender.", "NTA - their level of disappointment in what their child's gender instead of being happy for this blessing is on them and the way they project it on you says all you need to know about their character as humans.", "NTA and I feel so sorry for that coming baby.", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t worry, 5th times the charm\n\nThey sound like they\u2019ll keep going until they get the girl they want", "NTA.    If they wanted to be sure, they could have found out from their doctor at any time.   It's your place to fill their order, not take the place of the doctor.\n\nPlus, if they really knew they were having a girl, there would be no reason for a gender reveal in the first place.     They just convinced themselves that they were entitled to their girl and fate/God/whatever was going to give it to them.\n\nIncidentally, years ago one of my classmates was boy #7 in his family--and he only existed because his parents just kept trying for that girl.   They finally gave up after him.  This kind of thing happens and your brother and SIL need to grow up and accept it.", "I feel bad for the baby. NTA", "NTA\n\nIf you had given them a heads up they would be mad at you for that too. This was a no win, shoot the messenger situation.

Even if you \u201cgave them a heads up\u201d they\u2019d still blame it on you and say you ruined the surprise anyways. They are being ridiculous.  Your family needs to get their geads out of their asses and support you.", "NTA, you were in a no-win situation. If you told them beforehand, then they would still find a reason to blame you because they are upset about the gender of their child. They should have just found out the gender from the doctor and kept it to themselves.", "NTA.\nYou did your job, you are not responsible for the baby gender and you are not responsible for their poor choice of having a gender reveal.\nNo one in your position would call a client to warn them about something like that.\n\nThey made their decision to find out this way. Well, play stupid games...\n\nDon't give them anything back, the money or else. You were professional and reacted perfectly to the situation.", "NTA. They deluded themselves into disappointment. And it's gross to be disappointed by what's in your child's pants.", "NTA \n\nWhat would be the point in a gender reveal party if you told them ahead of time?\n\nPlus, if they had gone with any other bakery, it\u2019s not like they would have been told ahead of time anyway. They shouldn\u2019t get mad at you for doing your job in a professional way.", "NTA \n\nThey\u2019re disappointed in the gender and are taking it out on you. If you had told them beforehand, there is a good chance they would have been just as angry with you claiming that you ruined the reveal and would have asked for the cake for free.\n\nThey have 3 children, they should know that the person making the cake doesn\u2019t control the gender. \n\nMaybe this time since they were planning on a girl, should have asked the doctor, the medical profession before the reveal to tell them if it\u2019s another boy. \n\nYou are a business and why would you refund a cake that you made because they are having a boy not a girl. \n\nThe issue is with the sperm, not the color cake.", "NTA. Right now they're just looking for someone to blame and you're a convenient target. I'd just stick to yourself for a couple weeks and let it blow over. No reason to add fuel to the fire unless they continue pushing the matter weeks from now.", ">My brother calls me out in front of everyone\n\nNTA - You were at no point, under any obligation to tell them. Taking their disappointment out on you was uncalled for. Their feelings are real but not your fault. Yes I'm sure it sucks for them but blaming you in front of everyone is just shitty.", "NTA - if you weren\u2019t family would they have been this upset at the cake maker? Absolutely not! This is no way your fault, they are deflecting their gender disappointment on to you", "NTA the \u201cheads up\u201d they expected is the one the ultrasound tech gives you, or the one on the paper, or they could have asked. They chose to keep it a secret from themselves by handing you an unopened note and then expected you to spill the secret if it wasn\u2019t what they wanted? \n\nAlso gender reveals are ridiculous. They\u2019re making it seem like the only reason they had this child is to have a girl, which is a terrible decision.", "NTA.\n\nBut in my opinion your title should read \"for NOT disclosing gender BEFORE the gender reveal.\"\n\nThe parents were upset because they wanted a girl, and they lashed out at you even though it was illogical to do so.  I'm sure when they calmed down they realized they attacked you unfairly.", "NTA- To me it sounds like they were embarrassed and disappointed to not be having a girl and needed somebody to blame in the moment instead of themselves. I hope they take good care of this fourth baby... Not his fault he\u2019s a boy.", "NTA. They\u2019re directing their anger and disappointment about having a boy towards you - shooting the messenger. It\u2019s not fair, but just try to remind yourself that this isn\u2019t about you at all", "NTA How the heck are people this stupid?\nAlso, gender reveals are inherently stupid. Just ask for the damn gender of your kid and move on. Sorry your man spit out the wrong gametes.", "Nta\n\n\nThis is sick. They put so much hope on one gender.  They should be happy they are bringing a new child home. And love unconditionally.  \n\n\nI honestly believe they need to do some soul searching.\n\n\nThey are putting so much blame onto you. You can not control the gender. This whole situation is uncomfortable.", "NTA. They'd be angry at you no matter what you did. They're doing some heavy mental gymnastics to make it *someone's* fault that they aren't getting the gender they wanted, and they're even trying to cover that up by saying the reason they're mad is because you didn't warn them.\n\nNo. They're mad they didn't get a little girl and they think it's safe to take it out on you, and their behavior is disgusting for a multitude of reasons.", "NTA. Your \"family\" is built with a bunch of idiots", "NTA.  I am so glad all of my kids were born back when gender reveal was just a quick phone call to say, \"Just got back from the ultrasound, we are having a boy/girl.\"", "NTA. What was even the point of doing a gender reveal and keeping it a secret from themselves if they feared embarrassing themselves if they were wrong? They were the ones who decided to make the gender reveal a surprise even for themselves, you just followed through with what they ordered.\n\nBesides, they'd likely have complained anyway if you did try to give them a heads up. There was just no winning for you here.", "NTA\n\nThey shouldn't have had a public gender reveal if this was going to be the reaction\n\n\nThey could have found out during the ultrasound and processed whatever feelings of disappointment they had privately.\n\nThey chose to not find out the gender of the baby until their party. That was their choice. They didn't have to do it that way.  They had the info and chose to keep it a secret from themselves despite desperately wanting a girl.\n\nThis is all on them. They hyped themselves up when they had the answer in front of them\n\n\nI've had 5 kids. By kid number 4 you get a pretty good idea of what you are looking at on an ultrasound.  I knew my youngest was a boy before the tech confirmed it.  \n\nI get gender disappointment is real but with that high of hopes for a girl, they did this to themselves.", "NTA - wow, your family is nuts.  \n\nYou gotta remind them that you were only involved in making the cake, not the baby. :-)", "NTA\n\nI don't really understand what they wanted you to do. \n\nYou did exactly the same thing you always do, and frankly all people insisting on elaborate gender reveals are AHs.", "NTA. They're insane. First of all, they prepared everything around a \"feeling\" that it's a girl (and I'm not even going into the stupid gender stereotypes about everything being pink for a girl). They asked you to keep the secret, and get mad at YOU because they didn't get the gender the wanted. Mental institution.\n\nI am sad for the kid too, i feel they will be mad at him for not being their perfect little girl.", "NTA bro your family is insane and i feel bad for the poor baby boy whos about to be born", "NTA.  \nMaybe you should've told them not to get ahead of themselves, but yeah, if you don't know what the sex of your next is, don't start buying gender specific stuff. It's just bad decision making.", "NTA. Based on the title I thought you meant you told the guests the gender of the baby before the cake was cut or something like that. All you did is bake a cake and follow instructions! Why would they be mad at you? They assumed... and they got it wrong. Why would that be your fault?", "NTA messenger just got shot.", "NTA. That poor kid... You did the right thing, though, and this 'hate' is just stupid...!", "They asked you to make a gender reveal cake, not to cater to their delusions and fantasies. If that is what they wanted you to do, they should have been more specific. You are not a mind reader. NTA", "NTA. They really shouldn\u2019t have done a gender reveal if they weren\u2019t prepared for reality of another boy. \n\nPs as the middle of 5 girls. My parents prayed the last one was a girl because \u201cwe know what we are doing\u201d", "NTA and now you know why you don't do things for family - ever.  Sorry you were abused like that.  Yes, that was abuse.  Don't take it!  If they contact you in the future, demand an apology before anything else.  No apology, no talk.  You deserve better.", "I mean, technically, it's BIL's fault, as his gamete determined the sex. Blame his cum.\n\nNTA", "NTA I\u2019m pregnant and just found out the gender this week. If you are so invested in the gender, and feel like you\u2019ll have some gender disappointment one way or another you should be finding out privately. We did exactly this, having a bakery make something. But it was small and intimate just my husband and I. We might do a reveal for everyone else but it was important that I know privately, especially because I knew I would maybe be upset. \n\nDo not give them your money back, you\u2019re a business and they\u2019re your customers. It\u2019s insane they started preparing for a different outcome with no reassurance. They embarrassed themselves. I\u2019m sorry your family sucks.", "NTA And imagine how they would have reacted if you spilled the beans.\n\nWe trusted you, and you went and told us in advance. You ruined the surprise. Why couldn't you have let us believe for another while we are getting a girl. \n\nYou destroyed our dreams.", "I'm fairly sure I've seen one of these where the parents were complaining because the baker accidently let the gender slip in advance.\n\nThe whole concept is ridiculous and childish.\n\nIt's like they're blaming you for them having a baby of the \"wrong\" gender. Why on earth would they expect their money back? Are the planning on \"returning\" the baby as well?\n\nNTA", "NTA \n\nDon't have a gender reveal party if there is a 50% chance of gender disappointment.", "NTA. If they were that bothered they should have asked for a heads up. We found out so I had time to process it, not because I cared either way, but because it came straight after a late loss (seriously, my daughter was born before our kids was a year old, after being told no way naturally\u2026 I guess she wasn\u2019t listening!) and I wanted any sadness out of the way (as best as it could be) before our daughter was born.", "NTA \n\nThe fact that they told everyone to buy gifts for a girl is not your fault since they didn\u2019t actually know that they were having a girl or not, because also what was the point of having a gender reveal if you \u2018know\u2019 it\u2019s a girl?\nThey jumped the gun with getting everything, got people to buy clothes for a girl when they didn\u2019t even know. It is their fault.", "Fucking absurd, NTA. Gender reveals are already dumb, getting upset and attacking someone over one is just moronic. Fuck a heads up, they need to pull their heads out of their asses and realize they literally had the info and chose not to look.", "People who have public gender disappointment like that are definitely AHs, if you think you might have it at least have the decency to do it in private - NTA", "I guarantee had you told them in advance, they would have also called you an AH.  But clearly, you're NTA and a true professional. It's called \"shooting the messenger\" and tag, you're it!", "NTA. Gender reveals are stupid but they chose the game, you played by the rules, and apparently they somehow think they lost at 'gender reveals'.", "NTA those people are ridiculous and delusional \ud83d\ude44", "NTA. You did nothing wrong, they\u2019re placing their disappointment and anger at you because they\u2019re too embarrassed to realise how irrational they\u2019ve been. They need to work on that fast. Let it cool down because right now there\u2019s lots of heightened emotions , but please know you did exactly what you were supposed to.", "NTA. They're the ones who got so deeply in their head that it was a girl to begin with. It's not your fault that you made the cake exactly how it should've been", "Nta. You filled a cake order to specs. Not your fault he makes boys AND assumptions.", "NTA.\n\n But imagine if the doctor fucked up and the baby ends up being a girl.", "NTA. If you\u2019d given them a heads up they would\u2019ve kicked off that you ruined their gender reveal.", "NTA- it's not like you decide the gender. Those stupid people.", "You are NTA. They are assholes for having a gender reveal in the first place and now they\u2019re even worse.", "You were hired as a professional and acted accordingly.\n\nThis is them dumping their frustration on you because they wanted a girl and are not getting one. If you had told them before the shower, they would be mad at you too.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, don't do the gender reveal cake for their next baby. Everyone should be yelling at your brother because it's his sperm that picks the gender.", "NTA People are giving SIL a free pass because she is pregnant. What she needs is therapy, not people supporting her twisted mindset.", "NTA\u2026take a break from these people. Delusional is an exceptionally kind way to categorize them. Yikes.", "NTA - you were put in a no-win situation. Personally I think gender reveal parties are idiotic, but that's what they wanted. They were delusional to start planning for a girl until they knew. They took their disappointment out on you. And they want their money back? Such gall - you did your job. Working with family and friends is so filled with risks of petty backlash like this that I just really don't ever want to do it.", "NTA", "NTA. Oh for the love of everything\u2026They sound like a whole nightmare. It was nobody\u2019s decision but theirs to start preparing for a girl when they did not know the gender of their child, and if they didn\u2019t want to be \u201cembarrassed\u201d they should have checked the gender themselves, not had a party about it. I\u2019m sorry they took that disappointment out on you, hopefully they won\u2019t do the same to their child.", "If you would have told them.. I'm sure they wouldn't of been happy either. Seems like you cant win eith them. i think it's them that's TA .. you just did what you was supposed to do. NTA", "NTA \n\nIt would take everything in my to not laugh at them being so ridiculous. Tell SIL and reverse Henry VIII to get over it. Oh, gender reveals.", "Not TA! If you had the power to change the gender of a baby, then why the hell would you be running a bakery? This is a case of misplaced anger.\nIf anyone is to blame, it's them, since they're the ones who made the boy. The poor kid is going to be born into parents who don't want him making them the A-holes.", "NTA. They are projecting their disappointment onto you. \n\nI would just take some space from them so they can grieve (?!?!?!) the upcoming birth of their son. That poor kid.", "NTA\n\nI would demand that SIL and brother and her gross family apologize to me if they ever wanted to spend time with me again.  \n\nThe gender of the baby is literally your brother\u2019s fault.

Is the baby HEALTHY?!? I mean isn't that the important thing and why you get an ultrasound? Ugh some people are so blessed their curse is that they don't know it.", "NTA. You were hired not just to bake a cake, but also to keep a secret. If you let her know, you would've been yelled at for ruining the surprise. They're the AH's for blaming you for their reaction to your professional job. \n\nFunny story- I knew a woman in a similar situation. 5 boys, and decided to try one last time.

Please for the love of god ask everyone there to delete all pics/recordings of the reveal. How awful it would be for that baby to see the looks on his parents' faces.

You're not a mind reader.", "NTA.\n\nWow, what amazingly awful people they are. I mean, in every conceivable way, awful.\n\nFirst, the priority of a parent is a healthy child. Not a male or female, just healthy. \n\nSecond, you did EXACTLY what they told you to do. \n\nThird, they are giving you a hard time because you delivered the news - as if you had any control over it.\n\nAnd worst of all - they hosted a gender reveal party. Ugh.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA! You were paid to do a job & you did it. If they would've taken their business elsewhere, they would've received the same results with no refund.", "NTA they would have been pissed either way if you called them would have been mad if you made the cake they would have been mad. Tell them to get over it", "NTA. You literally did your job. You got the note from the doctor and you made the cake inside or whatever blue. They\u2019re complete idiots for thinking they just knew it was a baby girl. That\u2019s not how it works. Just because you\u2019re feeling something doesn\u2019t wish it into existence. Also you have a 50/50 shot of being tight or wrong. Buying and gendered clothes before the reveal is dumb too.", "NTA. Sounds like you\u2019re right, they\u2019re delusional", "NTA\n\nThis was a lose-lose situation, if you did say something they probably would've said you spoiled it.\n\n\nThey made all the assumptions and chose not to know, thats the point of a gender reveal party.

I'm sorry but your brother and SIL are WAAAAAY out of line with this behavior. Your parents are also out of line for not coming to your defense here - your brother and his wife jumped the gun and made asses of themselves and are now trying to pin their shame on you. \n\nEveryone in this story is an AH except for you, OP.", "NTA-I think they are just taking their frustration of the situation out on you.", "Hahah Nta why are they making the gender of their kid your problem!", "So NTA, it seems like you were in a lose lose. If you'd told them prior to the party then they'd have blamed you for ruining it that way. This is not on you.", "Once I hit my 30's I saw my social circle get smaller and smaller. I started to imagine that I have this little island that only people who treat me well, root for me, want to see me succeed, encourage me etc. They are on my island. My people.  I noticed there is a lot of family and friends who I wouldn't really want on that island. Treat me poorly, take and never give, take advantage of my kindness and generosity,  always looking out for their best interests etc etc.. we are not obliged or owe anybody explanations, gifts, help that we don't want to help with or feel uncomfortable doing.  Im rambling at this point, but fuck them. NTA", "NTA damned if you do damned if you don\u2019t. I would have done the same thing you did. You were in an impossible situation. Don\u2019t take their abuse, they are just upset they aren\u2019t having a girl. Call them out that they are abusing you because they are mad at something out of their control, then go no contact until the apologies", "NTA. How can you be held responsible? Their position on this is utterly ridiculous and preposterous. And I fail to see why you're getting backlash from the family either. Oh and no refund unless a girl pops out.", "NTA. you did what they asked. You were nice. They\u2019re being psycho.", "NTA, I mean you were arguably in a position where you might have given a 'heads up' but it is their fault for creating a situation where that was even a thing. Sounds like their disappointment over the baby being a boy is now being directed at you, which is really unfair.", "NTA.  But what kind of doctor says there is a \"good chance\" it is a girl.

When I woke up and was told it was a boy, I was like \"you're kidding!\" Give away most of the clothing that were obviously girl stuff. His favorite toy was a little pink doll rattle.

Business is very good and I have recently been having a lot of customers requesting for items for their gender reveals. Cakes, cupcakes, cake pops even chocolate covered strawberries etc.\n\nThe customer will give me a piece of paper with the gender of their baby written on it from their doctor, I'll then apply whatever the gender of the baby is to their order. Super simple.\n\nMy older brother and SIL are expecting their fourth child in a few months. They already have 3 boys and have been hoping and praying to finally have a girl. \n\nSo much to the point that they've been telling the entire family they know this baby is going to be a girl, they can \"feel it\". They've already started decorating their nursery to cater to a baby girl. Having already been buying/requesting that family members gift them clothes for a baby girl. They already have a name picked out and everything. Apparently their doctor also told them there a good chance the baby is a girl, but not 100%.\n\nThey asked to make something for their gender reveal, I said of course as I've done their past 3 gender reveals for their boys. BIL comes in to give me the paper with the gender, my staff and I get started on the order and open the note to reveal the gender is a boy...\n\nNow immediately after seeing this note I was thinking to myself \"oh shit\" because I knew that they had already started preparing for a baby girl and that the gender reveal was mainly going to be catered around the baby being a girl (pink balloons and decorations etc).\n\nBut I obviously was not about to tell them this before the gender reveal, because that would ruin it, so I just proceeded as normal and finished their order.\n\nDay of the gender reveal arrives, they decided on a cake, they cut their cake and the inside is of course blue.\n\nSIL immediately starts crying, everyone is just awkwardly silent. My brother calls me out in front of everyone and questions that surely this must be a mistake and not their cake? I confirm with them this is indeed their cake.\n\nSIL starts screaming at me that I embarrassed them in front of the entire family by not giving them a \"heads up\" about the gender. I asked her isn't that the whole point of a gender reveal? Why would I disclose the gender to you and ruin the day.\n\nI told both if them that I'm not the one who decided the gender of the baby, so I'm not sure why their attacking me and it's not my fault they did so much preplanning that it would be a girl. \n\nSIL told me to shut up and started calling me nasty names, I called her and my brother delusional.\n\nSince the baby shower they have been contacting me nonstop for their money back. My SIL's family hates me, my family is trying to stay neutral but thinks i should've given a \"heads up\".\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA. You would be damned if you told them and damned if you didn't.

I see no wrong with what you did... id give em their money back and I wouldn't never make anything for them again baby/gender wise. They're just letting their disappointments out on you. You're far from the asshole. Pregnancy hormones are a bitch too I can see why she's upset 4 boys? I'll pray for her lol.\n\nEdit: make it a point if they have another child, take their gender reveal to someone else in the family since this is the outcome.
