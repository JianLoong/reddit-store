To clarify a few things: \n1. I don\u2019t live in the US. I\u2019m not a lawyer, I don\u2019t know anything about the legality of a private letting agency specifying their properties are not suitable for people with children. \n2. I\u2019m extremely aware of the fact that the parents are limited in what they can do, hence why I asked here in the first place. Like I said, the crying I totally understand is out of their control and wouldn\u2019t be something I\u2019d mention to them, it\u2019s the random screeching that goes on forever that I\u2019d mention (in as  polite and non accusatory way as possible). \n3. Cheers to everyone saying \u201cjust move\u201d bro what part of housing crisis did you not read?

They are breaking the rules by having children live there.\n\nGoing with NTA simply for them breaking the rules. But don't confront them directly.\n\nAlso, if you go to the letting agency, maybe they can find you somewhere else for the same price and quieter.", "NTA\n\nNormally, I would say you are an AH because babies literally cannot control themselves. If you are suffering that much as the neighbour, I guarantee you the human adults living with the baby are having it worse. \n\nBut in this case, you specified that the rental agency has a policy that does not permit residents to have children.

If you can speak to them politely about the noise, then I'd say you're all good.", "NAH.  Your neighbor may not be aware that the noise carries over so much.  You can't really expect the baby to be quiet, right?  But it doesn't hurt to politely mention that you can hear the noise very clearly.  I would want to know, even with a toddler.  You could even say, \"I'm not sure you can even do anything about it.\" Good luck with it.", ">I know the letting agency does not allow children. \n\nNta.\n\nReally I would just make recordings of the noises.

I don't think you'd be the AH for mentioning to them that it can get a little too loud sometimes and asking if they could keep it down, as long as you're not rude about it. They genuinely may not think it's a problem and if you voice a concern they might be able to take action to mitigate it.", "NAH.  You can't willpower your way past the noise affecting you that way, and children that age are just Like That, *and* I know that the housing market is terrible.\n\nFor more information:  12 to 18 months is transitioning between what I call the cockatoo stage, when kids are figuring out how much they can do with their voices (a lot!!!), and toddlerhood, which is a time of continual frustration as children's ability to imagine and plan grows hugely but their verbal and physical abilities don't keep up.  The important part here is that neither stage includes the ability to put a pause between impulse and action.  Their tiny brains just are not that developed yet.  Excited about snacktime = screech.  Attempt walking and fail = cry.\n\nIf it is interfering with your sleep, quietly warn your neighbors that although you understand that times are tough, you have a tough choice coming up, and give them a 90-day deadline or whatever you can endure for finding alternate housing.\n\nAnother suggestion for them is baby sign language, which will not stop the noise entirely but can remove some of the frustration that tiny children feel about trying to communicate:  most people can learn to sign before they can learn to speak.", "NTA. Report them to the leasing agency", "NAH, I feel for you, but I also feel for the couple with the baby. I don't think it's entirely rude if you gently let them know you can hear the baby in case there is something they can do, as long as you're kind and understanding if they say no.\n\nOther solutions might be moving your bed against a wall that doesn't share with these neighbors, or putting more soundproof materials along that wall.", "NTA", "This really depends on how you choose to approach that conversation. \n\nIf you come at it from a place of- hey- I noticed the baby is crying a lot, it goes right through the walls, is there anything I can do to help? How are you holding up? Basically, be kind and understanding- then you are letting them know that there is a problem without blaming them for something that they only so much control over right now. It\u2019s a heads up because if you can hear it- likely others can too. \n\nThere are also peel and stick sound dampeners that he can put on your shared wall that will help tamp it down- not sure how well it would work on your side. I would stick some up and see if that helps. But I would even offer to help him out if he\u2019d be willing to do your shared wall. (And if it is that bad I would consider paying for it within reason.) Do you have to do these things? No. Is it a more effective solution? Likely. \n\nBut if you come at it like: hey- your kid is too loud with the screaming- this needs to stop or I\u2019m putting in a noise complaint- or in any way get aggressive with him- YWBTA. As long as he isn\u2019t breaking the terms of his lease- he has every right to house his child with him. And babies, unfortunately go through phases where they cry a lot sometimes.", "For the baby crying there 3 choices\n\nYou move\n\nThey move\n\nSomething criminally abusive to the baby.\n\nIf children are not allowed you could report them to management.", "YTA, you made the choice to live in studio apartments.

See if they will put it up for adoption. If they won\u2019t, then try to get them evicted so they can take that obnoxious noise to the local homeless shelter (or at least away from you).

Period. \n\nThe banging is a separate issue. It may just be regular activities causing the noise, in which case, it's really not their problem.

If there are specific leasing rules prohibiting children then you\u2019re essentially doing nothing wrong.

Hopefully they\u2019d be receptive to this. I guess if it continued then reporting them is the only option", "Kindly, YTA.  I get that it's annoying, but it's a baby, and babies cry.
