To clarify a few things: \n1. I don\u2019t live in the US.

I\u2019m extremely aware of the fact that the parents are limited in what they can do, hence why I asked here in the first place. Like I said, the crying I totally understand is out of their control and wouldn\u2019t be something I\u2019d mention to them, it\u2019s the random screeching that goes on forever that I\u2019d mention (in as  polite and non accusatory way as possible). \n3.

But don't confront them directly.\n\nAlso, if you go to the letting agency, maybe they can find you somewhere else for the same price and quieter.", "NTA\n\nNormally, I would say you are an AH because babies literally cannot control themselves. If you are suffering that much as the neighbour, I guarantee you the human adults living with the baby are having it worse. \n\nBut in this case, you specified that the rental agency has a policy that does not permit residents to have children.

I don't think you'd be the AH for mentioning to them that it can get a little too loud sometimes and asking if they could keep it down, as long as you're not rude about it. They genuinely may not think it's a problem and if you voice a concern they might be able to take action to mitigate it.", "NAH.  You can't willpower your way past the noise affecting you that way, and children that age are just Like That, *and* I know that the housing market is terrible.\n\nFor more information:  12 to 18 months is transitioning between what I call the cockatoo stage, when kids are figuring out how much they can do with their voices (a lot!!!), and toddlerhood, which is a time of continual frustration as children's ability to imagine and plan grows hugely but their verbal and physical abilities don't keep up.  The important part here is that neither stage includes the ability to put a pause between impulse and action.  Their tiny brains just are not that developed yet.  Excited about snacktime = screech.  Attempt walking and fail = cry.\n\nIf it is interfering with your sleep, quietly warn your neighbors that although you understand that times are tough, you have a tough choice coming up, and give them a 90-day deadline or whatever you can endure for finding alternate housing.\n\nAnother suggestion for them is baby sign language, which will not stop the noise entirely but can remove some of the frustration that tiny children feel about trying to communicate:  most people can learn to sign before they can learn to speak.", "NTA. Report them to the leasing agency", "NAH, I feel for you, but I also feel for the couple with the baby. I don't think it's entirely rude if you gently let them know you can hear the baby in case there is something they can do, as long as you're kind and understanding if they say no.\n\nOther solutions might be moving your bed against a wall that doesn't share with these neighbors, or putting more soundproof materials along that wall.", "NTA", "This really depends on how you choose to approach that conversation. \n\nIf you come at it from a place of- hey- I noticed the baby is crying a lot, it goes right through the walls, is there anything I can do to help? How are you holding up? Basically, be kind and understanding- then you are letting them know that there is a problem without blaming them for something that they only so much control over right now. It\u2019s a heads up because if you can hear it- likely others can too. \n\nThere are also peel and stick sound dampeners that he can put on your shared wall that will help tamp it down- not sure how well it would work on your side. I would stick some up and see if that helps. But I would even offer to help him out if he\u2019d be willing to do your shared wall. (And if it is that bad I would consider paying for it within reason.) Do you have to do these things? No. Is it a more effective solution? Likely. \n\nBut if you come at it like: hey- your kid is too loud with the screaming- this needs to stop or I\u2019m putting in a noise complaint- or in any way get aggressive with him- YWBTA. As long as he isn\u2019t breaking the terms of his lease- he has every right to house his child with him.

This is 100% on you, leave this family alone they are struggling enough.", "I'm not really sure what you expect them to do?", "I don\u2019t think YWBTA but especially as the letting agency doesn\u2019t allow children.", "When the baby is crying, I suspect they are already trying to get it to stop- so telling them to get the baby to stop crying is not going to be useful. See if they will put it up for adoption. If they won\u2019t, then try to get them evicted so they can take that obnoxious noise to the local homeless shelter (or at least away from you).

Period. \n\nThe banging is a separate issue. It may just be regular activities causing the noise, in which case, it's really not their problem. There's a difference between being inappropriately loud, and just going about your life.", "I've never heard of places not allowing children. Sound like they have a colicky baby if he is crying screaming all the time. And that sucks to be in that situation for both of you. I think talking to them would be good because they in the very least could minimize the banging noises. NTA", "NTA. If there are specific leasing rules prohibiting children then you\u2019re essentially doing nothing wrong. But for me personally, not applying this to you, I think trying to have a discussion with the neighbors with the child about understanding that children make noise but sometimes it\u2019s a little loud due to the thin walls. Hopefully they\u2019d be receptive to this. I guess if it continued then reporting them is the only option", "Kindly, YTA.  I get that it's annoying, but it's a baby, and babies cry.

Unfortunately, while housing discrimination based on age is technically legal, it is superseded by the federal Fair Housing Act of 1968, which prohibits discrimination based on, among other things, familial status, which includes families with children.

But there\u2019s nothing wrong with asking your neighbors to be mindful of the noise they make, as unproductive as it would likely be.", "INFO: How is it legal that they don't allow children to live there?

I personally would go out of my way to avoid having a cold share a wall with me. One of my issues at the last place was that I couldn't have my windows open during nice days, the neighbors kids would run some screaming at the top of their lungs. The youngest was barely toddling and the screams were horrific! I didn't say anything because kids run and scream, but I had to pay a much higher electric bill since I couldn't just open the windows.

They're likely doing their best with the noise. You do have a right to enjoy your apartment that you pay for. There could be a wide variety of things that are causing baby to cry and screech. \n\nWhat I think you're likely hearing OP, is that baby is learning how big their lungs are and is learning to fine tune volume and how to move their mouth to make words. All babies do it, and theres only so much shushing that you can do. I do my best to distract my little one, but sometimes she has thoughts all on her own that she *has* to vocalize. \n\nAgain, not ideal at all.

You live in an apartment so you are responsible for everyone in your apartment not bothering the other residents.
