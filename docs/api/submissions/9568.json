I don't think you'd be the AH for mentioning to them that it can get a little too loud sometimes and asking if they could keep it down, as long as you're not rude about it.

You can't willpower your way past the noise affecting you that way, and children that age are just Like That, *and* I know that the housing market is terrible.\n\nFor more information:  12 to 18 months is transitioning between what I call the cockatoo stage, when kids are figuring out how much they can do with their voices (a lot!!!), and toddlerhood, which is a time of continual frustration as children's ability to imagine and plan grows hugely but their verbal and physical abilities don't keep up.  The important part here is that neither stage includes the ability to put a pause between impulse and action.  Their tiny brains just are not that developed yet.  Excited about snacktime = screech.  Attempt walking and fail = cry.\n\nIf it is interfering with your sleep, quietly warn your neighbors that although you understand that times are tough, you have a tough choice coming up, and give them a 90-day deadline or whatever you can endure for finding alternate housing.\n\nAnother suggestion for them is baby sign language, which will not stop the noise entirely but can remove some of the frustration that tiny children feel about trying to communicate:  most people can learn to sign before they can learn to speak.", "NTA. Report them to the leasing agency", "NAH, I feel for you, but I also feel for the couple with the baby. I don't think it's entirely rude if you gently let them know you can hear the baby in case there is something they can do, as long as you're kind and understanding if they say no.\n\nOther solutions might be moving your bed against a wall that doesn't share with these neighbors, or putting more soundproof materials along that wall.", "NTA", "This really depends on how you choose to approach that conversation. \n\nIf you come at it from a place of- hey- I noticed the baby is crying a lot, it goes right through the walls, is there anything I can do to help? How are you holding up? Basically, be kind and understanding- then you are letting them know that there is a problem without blaming them for something that they only so much control over right now. It\u2019s a heads up because if you can hear it- likely others can too. \n\nThere are also peel and stick sound dampeners that he can put on your shared wall that will help tamp it down- not sure how well it would work on your side. I would stick some up and see if that helps. But I would even offer to help him out if he\u2019d be willing to do your shared wall. (And if it is that bad I would consider paying for it within reason.) Do you have to do these things? No. Is it a more effective solution? Likely. \n\nBut if you come at it like: hey- your kid is too loud with the screaming- this needs to stop or I\u2019m putting in a noise complaint- or in any way get aggressive with him- YWBTA. As long as he isn\u2019t breaking the terms of his lease- he has every right to house his child with him.

See if they will put it up for adoption. If they won\u2019t, then try to get them evicted so they can take that obnoxious noise to the local homeless shelter (or at least away from you).

Asking a struggling parent to \"keep down\" their crying child? How can you think that's fine?", "YTA. Babies literally **cannot** control their emotions, or the noises they make.

If there are specific leasing rules prohibiting children then you\u2019re essentially doing nothing wrong.

That\u2019s their job. They are likely to appreciate the heads up if they could be subject to fines for breaking density rules. Best of luck!!!!", "If the building does not allow children, it doesn't allow children. That's the end of it. Especially if the building is set up in a way that a screaming baby would be EXTREMELY disruptive to other tenants. I understand that the adults in the other apartment can't do too much about the child being loud. However, at the end of the day, I don't have kids, and if I'm spending every night awake all hours because a child in the next apartment is keeping me awake wailing I'm going to be extremely unhappy about it. \nI'd argue that the other couple trying to sneakily move their baby into a place that doesn't allow children is the AH move. \nIf I somehow bait-and-switched into a 55+ retirement community and am disturbing other tenants, ill be kicked out, and there is nobody to blame but myself for trying to cheat the system and getting caught.\nI'm really empathetic about the housing crisis but OP has just as much right to reasonable living quarters as this other family.", "How are you empathetic if you\u2019re willing to throw a family to the streets?", "True, but you shouldn\u2019t bring a crying baby to a place where children aren\u2019t welcome.", "OP isn't throwing anybody out. They are violating their lease agreement. Therefore, the landlord will be throwing them out, and well within their right to do so.\nMy lease agreement says I'm allowed one cat. If I go and adopt 15 more, as much as I love cats, my landlord wouldn't be a heartless monster for evicting me or asking that I get rid of the pets. I am the ah for blatantly violating the terms of our written agreement and lying about it, then playing victim. I'm generally pretty empathetic about this kinda stuff but this just isn't how the world works.", "I'm in the US and I can tell you didn't read the comments above. OP is not in the US and most are laws are not the same as in other countries."]}
