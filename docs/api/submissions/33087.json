I am in my pediatric oncology rotation at the moment. \n\nThose who started the rotation with me (2 male and 1 female) decided to shave off their hair in solidarity with a patient one of them had. She is an 8 year old girl (I'll call her Amy) who feels horrible about losing her hair. So these friends of mine promised her mom to shave their hair in solidarity with her.\n\nI have long straight hair. And I put it all up in a bun whenever I go into the ward. I really like my hair and I will only be here in this rotation for a short time so it did not really make sense for me to go bald for it. I applaud my friends. I personally just didn't want to do it.\n\nThe next day every one of those friends were bald except for me. Amy's mother took a look at me and called me a hypocrite with no empathy because I didn't do as my friends did. I did not tell Amy or her mom I would shave my hair yet her mother was extremely mad at me.\n\nMy girlfriend (Kate - 29F) is a general surgery resident and she told me I had nothing to worry about. However, I think I somehow made a mistake. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
