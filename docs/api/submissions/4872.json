Every winter either on or a weekend before or after they invite everyone to come up for Christmas. I rarely go because, well, it sucks. The place is huge, with bedrooms and a restroom upstairs, a bedroom and bathroom on the main floor, and a bedroom and bathroom downstairs. \n\nI f24 hate visiting. My parents are old, and only clean up the main floor and the downstairs. The only thing they\u2019ll clean upstairs is the toilet. Which means the bathroom upstairs is always filthy. The sink will have hair, toothpaste residue, and more. The shower will be the worst, with dead bugs, hair, unknown specks of stuff all over. It\u2019s revolting. When I stay I\u2019m forced to stay upstairs and I can\u2019t use the restroom downstairs because A) the stairs are LOUD and going down them at night will wake everyone up, and B) even with my parents cleaning the mid level restroom it\u2019s still not much better either. They don\u2019t really clean the shower. \n\nSo whenever I visit I\u2019m forced to shower in filth. What\u2019s even more frustrating, is I hardly go down there. The main people who use that restroom are my niece (14) and nephews (15, 16). They go to the cabin multiple times a year and never clean anything. They\u2019re the ones who created the filth in the bathroom. And yet, every time I come down my parents expect ME to be the one to clean the entire thing. Which means for one the bathroom is only getting cleaned once every year at best with multiple uses from my niece and nephews. I\u2019m also expected to clean the downstairs restroom. And my sister and brother in law are not better. If anything- they\u2019re worse. The last time I came down I had to clean up fluids. The restroom I used my niece had her cycle and got it on the toilet seat, and the bathroom downstairs that my sister and brother in law used had brown smears ALL over it and yellow splotches and it smelled. I gagged and refused to clean that. My teenage niece I could forgive but not two grown adults. \n\nAnyways, any time I\u2019ve complained about it my parents are upset. They\u2019re old with health conditions and struggle to clean things. At home they hire a cleaner because they can\u2019t do a lot of it anymore. I feel bad for not helping them with the cabin, but I hate cleaning every single time I come down while none of the people who made the messes have to. Last time after having to clean up everything I swore to never come back again. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA for refusing to go to the cabin?", "created_utc": 1671190851, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zncopp/aita_for_refusing_to_go_to_the_cabin/", "score": 269, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
