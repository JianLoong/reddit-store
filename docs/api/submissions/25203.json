No call, no acknowledgement from the kids or my siblings/SILs at all and honestly I just think it's rude and I'm sick of it. \n\nSince moving further away I initially thought about posting the gifts and then I just decided I wasn't going to do it anymore. I still always send cards to the kids, my brothers and their wives (I never get any back) but the gifts have totally stopped now. \nThey have never said anything about it. \n\nI was talking to a friend the other day and mentioned I don't gift anymore and basically she said that was an AH move as it's not the kids fault. \nSo now I'm thinking I probably am an AH.

Never sending any return cards, never reaching out to you (still haven't when the gifts have stopped, you could be dead for all they know and still nothing).\n\nSounds like you were doing great, maybe they became jealous?

Sure, it's not all on the kids, but they also never send you a thank you letter, text, or call to say thanks. If they don't care enough to say \"I like auntie LemonRoll_Rabbit, let's invite her\" or even to call to say thanks for the gift, they're ungrateful too and you're just wasting your time and money.", "I love my nieces and nephews and they know it.

It's not a super close relationship, but not a bad one at all, like no big bust ups.\nIt would be nice to be closer...  \n\nOne is very family focused, but family seems to now only be the bubble that is his wife and kids. He used to come to me for relationship advice a lot, but his wife stopped that as she was worried it would make me judge her, honestly 9/10 I was on her side. But out of respect he's stopped talking to me about that stuff. But they actually don't see much of the extended family anymore. \n\nThe other is just thoughtless and selfish, I don't think he's ever gotten me a Birthday card, he often exclaims \"speak to my receptionist to book a meeting\" he's talking about his wife and any time I'm trying to get us together, she however is not accepting role of receptionist (good on her in my books, I'd be furious if my husband spoke about me like that)\n\nOh and the kids Birthday party thing. Since I can remember they have always complained about kids parties, how often they have to go to them, how they would rather spend their weekends any other way, but they always get invited to lots.", ">Have you maybe made some choices they don't agree with, like sexual preferences perhaps\n\nI hope you mean sexual orientation because you sound ignorant.

I sent cards, called, visited them when in the area, but they never returned the favor. Years later of zero contact and I get a call out of the blue \"we were so close what happened?\" They ended up needing money, I hung up and blocked them.", "What an odd battle to pick.", "Yeah that's totally fucked. I'm sorry you're going through that. It really sucks when family alienates you like this. \n\nI don't know if the oldest has any ways to communicate with you, but there's some hope you can still a part of their lives even if their parents aren't willing to put any effort into it. It would really blow if you lost all communication, and they grew up without their aunt. \n\nMy aunts are cool as hell, and I couldn't imagine growing up without them.", "Oh wow. That's crazy. I'm sorry you've had to deal with that. But good on you for hanging up! \n\nHonestly my husband and I are actually considering moving even further away, we moved a couple hrs away initially, which is the furthest I've ever lived from my family, I didn't want to be too far away. \nI always thought we could be closer and the reason we weren't was because I didn't have kids yet...\nSince having our baby, I've realised that actually that's not going to change and I have very little family support, so I've stopped myself from living where I actually wanted because of hoping for a closer relationship with my family.
