He used to come to me for relationship advice a lot, but his wife stopped that as she was worried it would make me judge her, honestly 9/10 I was on her side. But out of respect he's stopped talking to me about that stuff. But they actually don't see much of the extended family anymore. \n\nThe other is just thoughtless and selfish, I don't think he's ever gotten me a Birthday card, he often exclaims \"speak to my receptionist to book a meeting\" he's talking about his wife and any time I'm trying to get us together, she however is not accepting role of receptionist (good on her in my books, I'd be furious if my husband spoke about me like that)\n\nOh and the kids Birthday party thing.

I'm sorry you're going through that. It really sucks when family alienates you like this. \n\nI don't know if the oldest has any ways to communicate with you, but there's some hope you can still a part of their lives even if their parents aren't willing to put any effort into it.

I'm sorry you've had to deal with that.

Strangely enough, those two lived within ten miles.  The granddaughter that was 9 at that time who lived on the opposite coast?

I used to go out of my way to give them bday presents until I realized that apparently the parents were just never going to bother having me over for anything (it's not malicious, I think they just don't think about it).
