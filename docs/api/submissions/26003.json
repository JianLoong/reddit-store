Despite my reservations, I agreed.\n\nRight after he sent the email, I checked the outbox behind his back. I was dismayed by the poor spelling and grammar \u2014 both in Spanish and English.

My son became very withdrawn afterward, and my husband says I was too harsh.\n\nMy reasoning is:\n\n1. Writing skills are important, even among long-time friends.\n2. He\u2019s only 8, and I feel it's my duty as a parent to guide him.\n3. However, I went against his explicit wish for privacy.\n\nNow my son's feelings are hurt, and my husband is annoyed with me.

You sound like a boundary stomper. And I would be upset, *too*. Stop it. \n\nHis wretched spelling isn\u2019t going to hurt anything. It will be a funny story, years from now, not an annoyed one, that you can\u2019t let the eight year old correspond freely with his, (no doubt), not spelling bee winning contemporaries.\n\nOh! And you said in the after comment that you corrected his emails, \u201cin front of family\u201d. So. In public. You embarrassed him. In public. \n\nAnd now your kid is \u201cvery withdrawn\u201d.

You sound controling and awful, but keep acting like a helicopter parent. You'll be back in a few years wondering why your child has moved out and refuses to speak to you.

I hate this for your son. Terrible job, mom.", "yes YTA. This isn't even school work, you're just lying and berating your kid for no reason.", "YTA here.\n\nWanting your kid to have good writing skills is fair, and wanting to track what an 8 year old is doing online is also fair, but you're mixing the two in the worst possible way.\n\nSaying that an 8-year old, who isn't *supposed* to be a great writer, makes you look like idiots because he's not sending professional quality emails is unnecessarily harsh, especially because you're the one who is supposed to be teaching him. You also made it clear that you're violating your kid's privacy not because you are concerned about the safety of his online habits (this would be reasonable!), but because you think he's an embarrassment.\n\nYou've managed to harm your ability to actually teach him writing skills in an academic setting (e.g. homework), and your ability to keep tabs on his online activity, and his trust in you as somebody who cares about him, all in one fell swoop.", "Being a helicopter parent to the extreme level you are at isn't something to be proud of.

He's writing and spelling words out like an 8-year-old would. Let him learn on his own. You being \"mortified\" and saying you \"look like idiots\" are only going to hinder his openness and make him ashamed of his own writing. \n\nEditing and \"taking liberties\" to his emails doesn't teach him anything but to not be himself. :(", "YTA\n\nWork with your child on writing skills in a normal supportive parenting role... sure. Don't do it by editing his communication within a friendship. \n\nHe is 8. Your assertion that his poor grammar reflects poorly on your whole family is incredibly self-centered. Quite honestly, your behavior here reflects poorly on your family. An 8 year old doesn't own much right to privacy *if* you are concerned about their safety. This isn't that. Being this exacting and controlling is going to stunt independence as your child turns into a man and creates anxiety.", "Jesus YTA!!!! Are you seriously concerned about your 8yo not being fully literate to the point that THAT is the reason you've been mucking with his emails? And then you state it makes YOU look like an idiot? Are you really that concerned about your own appearance that you're not willing to allow your son to develop literacy skills in the same way other kids do?\n\nThis is not okay. You should know that by the way your son is currently behaving. This is horrible,  vain behaviour  that you seriously need to rethink", "YTA. You broke his trust because you explicitly said you won\u2019t read his letters, and it may take a long while for you to rebuild it. By the way, children who learn they can\u2019t trust their parent(s) at 8 will keep them in the dark when they encounter serious problems in their future lives. \n\nHe is writing his own PRIVATE emails, not corporate letters in your company\u2019s name. \n\nI\u2019m all for proper spelling. But you can and should teach your child to spell without intruding in his private space (first of all, by introducing him to good books \u2014 nothing builds spelling skills like reading, trust me).", "YTA for somehow thinking your child's lack of adult spelling skills somehow reflects on you as parents. Just because you read your child's emails doesn't mean the friend's parents are as willing to violate their child's privacy.", "This isn\u2019t even just a question of privacy \u2013 it's about letting your son talk to his *friend*. It's so weird, if not creepy, to deceive his friend into think that he's talking to his 8 year old friend, when it was an adult who were his actual penpal. Your son is gonna end up resenting you if you keep up controlling and micromanaging him, taking away his autonomy, and chopping away at his sense of self-worth like that. YTA.", "Yes, YTA\n\n(a) I don't think you have a great deal of teaching skills, but that's something you can definitely fix. Google some teaching techniques, ask his teachers for tips and tricks. Sprucing up someone's writing is not a way to help (take it for a writer with 16 years experience in advertising).\n\nThis is something that worked on me when I was his age so maybe you can try it. If you need to correct his grammar, just take his homework (not his personal correspondence), read it, count the number of mistakes he has made and get him to hunt for his own mistakes, sort of like an easter egg. Tell him - Babe, i found 12 grammar issues in your text, you get 20 minutes to find them and then let me look at your paper again.\n\nLearn how to teach, you will love the progress he makes. And if he doesn't, eff it, there's a lot of software that's going to make sure his text is being spruced up. Maybe he gets good at something else.\n\n(b)  \"I was absolutely mortified and shared my concerns with my family, saying that this made us look like idiots.\" - ouch. No, your child does not make you look like an idiot, and even if he did, it's his job to make you look like an idiot. Humans are idiots. Your outside image doesn't matter. Looking like an idiot doesn't matter. Your relationship with your kid, his learning curve, trusting your family - these are things that matter.\n\nShame is something a lot of us deal with, and it's something that ruins a lot of relationships, growth opportunities, keeps us stuck. It's worth working on it.", "YTA in a big way.  You \"spruce up\" his writing?  No - you put your own voice in his writing because you feel superior.  You put your son down every time you \"spruce up\" his writing.  You are beyond a helicopter mom -- you are just plain narcissistic! \n\nI feel very sorry for your son.", "YTA. Your son asked for privacy, and you went against his wishes by checking his email. While you may have had good intentions regarding his writing skills, it's important to respect his boundaries. He's only 8 years old, and it's okay for him to make mistakes and learn from them. It's crucial to prioritize his feelings and autonomy over minor spelling and grammar errors. Your husband is right; you were too harsh, and your son's feelings are understandably hurt. Apologize to him and respect his privacy in the future.", "Yes yta.  He is 8.  Jesus christ, why do parents go against their kids wishes and then wonder why they get all the hate?", "YTA.  To your own point.  Yes, he is only 8 so his spelling isn't going to be great but I'm sure the other 8 y/o will be able to understand what he means.  Also privacy and independence are important.  Guide him towards those qualities so he can be more independent as he grows and respect other people's privacy.", "Also you are absolutely disgusting to say your eight yr old messing up on spelling in his private letters made you look like idiots. You realize how that makes you look as a parent for judging your son for that? Shame on you. Most kids at that age have bad spelling and writing, they grow out of it. With your guidance. They don't just know and he's not an idiot for it. You're disgusting", "YTA, he\u2019s 8, so he should not be allowed to have privacy on the internet. However, this is not school. You will kill any desire he has to write creatively and freely by squashing it now. You should explain to him the dangers of the internet as to why you feel a quick glance at his emails is necessary. You shouldn\u2019t change anything to them unless it\u2019s a safety reason; you should explain to him the reason. You should leave the rest of it alone. Insulting him in front of the entire family was completely unwarranted.", "YTA. He is only eight. You hurt your son's feelings by essentially saying that his skills are not good enough for you. The kid is trying to grasp learning the grammar, spelling, etc. for not just one language but two? I can't even grasp how you can make this about you and that it makes you \"look like idiots\". I can assure you, you are the only one judging your son this much. Get a life, and if you are that hung up on how people perceive you, maybe get some help with that. Being this critical of your son is only going to push him away from you, so be prepared for that if you can't reign in your own behavior.", "What the f is wrong with you? \n\nI would absolutely recommend seeing a licensed professional for your absolutely wildly controlling ways before you completely ruin the relationship you have with your son by stifling him under your bosom. \n\nSo what if your son misspells words and isn\u2019t Proust at EIGHT YEARS OLD. Some people just don\u2019t spell well, maybe find a way to nurture other things he is good at instead of berating him for not fitting into your perfect ideal of what he should be.\n\nBiggest AH I\u2019ve seen on here today.", "YTA\n\nHe asked you not to change the emails. And you decided that you needed to anyway. You betrayed his trust.", "YTA. You sound like the type of parent set on breaking your child\u2019s spirit through a thousand cuts. Do you criticize his art as well? His inability to always color within the lines?\n\nHe is writing with a purpose and that purpose is maintaining a relationship. Celebrate that. Let his teachers focus on spelling and grammar in school.", "YTA BIG TIME and i've only read a first paragraph\n\nPrivacy knows no excuses.", "YTA. the way you _might_ be perceived by others (because of your kid is being, well, a kid - whose spelling is perfect at 8?) is more important to you than your son's personal conversations and privacy?", "Yes yta, this was not the place to correct your son's spelling or writing at all. This was private letters he made for fun between him and a friend. The only reason you should ever check is if you think he is hiding something dangerous from you and you think he isn't telling you (obviously have a proper talk with him first before ever violating privacy for the sake of safety, thee are ways to go about it without being disrespectful) brt this was obviously not the case. You treated it like homework, which is the only place you should be checking his writing. Not his private letters but his school work. You have severally disrespected your son. Please apologize to him.", "YTA\n\nYou should be encouraging his writing-- no matter the spelling-- not discouraging him which will just turn him off to writing at a critical age! He'll learn more as ALL children do. And he's BILINGUAL. \n\nI thought you were going to say he was corresponding with an inappropriate adult or something. But it was just spelling issues. Jeezus. Be glad the kid is writing and keeping up with a personal friendship!", "YTA.\n\nI don't know if things have changed, but I certainly wasn't expected to have adult level writing skills when I was eight. It's not like your son is communicating to the Pope, he's talking to his friend. The fact that you immediately are more concerned about how this makes you look as a parent, instead of building your son's writing skills and confidence, speaks volumes about what kind of parent you are.", "YTA. Your son just wants to talk to his friend without you hovering over him judging his every thought and keystroke. You being cruel and controlling is the embarrassing thing here, not an eight-year-old's spelling mistakes.", "The quality of an 8 year old\u2019s email to his 8 year old friend makes you look like an idiot??? Are you always this critical of your LITERAL CHILDREN? He can improve his writing in one of the MANY other areas of his life where he writes and it will improve the quality of his emails but you should try and improve the quality of your parenting. YTA and a massive one.", "Soft YTA, but more because you brought it up with everyone.  Why not just sit down with him privately?\n\nI also agree - 8 yo do not have a right to privacy from parents, especially when dealing with anything on the internet.

I definitely understand wanting to impart good grammar onto your child but I think you\u2019re probably being a bit too intense. As for the privacy, an 8 year old doesn\u2019t need privacy and I\u2019m sure a lot of people will disagree with this.

I can understand why he is annoyed by your \"creative liberty\". You are writing an essay about a visit at the zoo, when he wants to have a chat with his friend. Not everyone wants to elaborate on everything and anything.", "So in other words you completely change what he said. That's exactly what your described.\n\nIf your son wanted to say all that about a trip to the zoo then he would have said that. Instead your just making up stuff you think you 'witnessed' and completely changing what he's trying to communicate. No wonder he doesn't want you doing this.", "That is exactly editing his voice.\n\nSome people's true voice is very laconic. To generalize (and no, this is not universal, there are definitely counter example, and I am about to be gendered), I have noticed that men tend to include far fewer details than women about many things. I know, because I have been called out on it by my female friends and relatives. You are in fact imposing your way of being on your son.\n\nAnd again, you shouldn't right for him. You should just point out the mistakes he has made and suggest improvements. Let him find his own voice.", "Also your son's friend wants to hear from your son, and your son wants to talk to him about his own thoughts and wordings. Not yours. Leave it alone.", "You are literally erasing his voice and limiting his creativity everytime you do this. Let him do this by himself, without you erasing it. It's one thing to need help with spelling or sentence structure, but to completely change up his thoughts??", "No matter what you personally witnessed, you're assuming that you know exactly what's going on inside *his* head, and then put words in his mouth. No matter what you've witnessed, you don't know all the ins and outs of your son's thoughts, feelings, and personal experiences of events. He's not an extension of you or your interpretations of him. He's an 8 year old child \u2013 those aren't typically known for their impeccable writing skills. You're not the editor of a novel he's writing. Jesus Christ. He's a kid exchanging e-mails with another kid.\n\n\nNot to be an armchair psychologist, but I think you should get yourself checked out, especially for covert narcissism. From everything you've written, it sounds like your son's well-being is at stake.", "Then you ask him if you can sit with him while he writes. If he just says \"we went to the zoo\" you ask him if he wants to tell his friend what his favorite animal was or the best part of the trip.\n\nWriting is a learned skill, he's not learning if you're writing for him and he's 8 so he's not going to be very good at it yet. He needs guidance not a ghost writer if you want him to elaborate in his emails.\n\nIf you want a creative writing essay on his awe and excitement on a zoo trip send your own emails.", "It isn't your place to change his writings in his private emails unless he specifically asked you for it. Save it for his damn homework not his private letters with his own thoughts and feelings. This isn't about perfecting his writing when he does this, thats what his homework is for.", "You absolutely are changing his voice. Kids his age don't describe themselves as being in awe and excited when seeing animals, or anything. They say they \"really liked them\" or that \"it was cool\", even just a flat \"it was good/neat/etc.\" This is how kids that age write. They write in short, extremely to the point, matter of fact statements that do not have the flourish of description as an adult writer. All of this is done with a lot of the bigger words spelled phonetically. This is the age where spelling and grammar start taking a bigger focus in lessons at school, it's normal to expect a lot of misspelled words and grammatical mistakes at this point. He's 8.\n\nYou're not editing his emails because you want his full experience captured. You're doing it because you think something normal for his age is embarrassing and reflects poorly on you. You want to impress the parents of his friend by making them think your son has this massive vocabulary and can write/spell like an adult. You want your son's friend to feel inferior to your son because they will have to get their parents to help them read the emails from \"your son.\" You want your son to feel ashamed of his writing because it doesn't match your completely insane standards and you think that will somehow make him improve.\n\nNot only are you single handedly destroying his confidence in his still budding writing abilities, but you're also destroying this long distance friendship that your son has managed to maintain and is clearly important to him.\n\nYTA. Such a massive one that words barely exist to describe it. Your husband isn't \"annoyed\", he's furious at the bullying of your son by you and he is seething inside. He's bottling it up to present a calmer, more restrained, front.", "HE'S 8", "Just reading this comment is giving me anxiety. Your poor son. He's 8. Let him write emails to his friends the way he wants to. He has school for learning and other avenues. YTA.", "Then I think his parents would easily be able to tell that the e-mails are written by an adult, and not an 8 year old child. *You* are embarrassing yourself.\n\n\nETA: Up to *your* standards, and you're making it very clear to your son that he's not living up to them. I feel so incredibly bad for him. I can't imagine how shitty he must feel about himself \u2013 because of you.", "This is so ridiculous.\n\nAlso, INFO: what are his friend's emails like?", "You were so \"upset\" that you eight year old sent spelling mistakes to another bloody eight year old that you couldn't help but put him down in front of his entire family WHILE publicly violating his trust and privacy?  \n\nFuck lady, get some therapy.\n\nWay to torpedo your kid like that.", "You are inappropriate! Your poor son.", "Your response sucks if that's what you think from an eight yr old.", "Look, you can't possibly cringe at egregious spelling and crappy grammar more than I do, and even I wouldn't react so badly to my eight-year-old butchering the language that I literally could not control the words that came out of my mouth. Being in \"a state of shock\" and having an \"instinctive, horrified response\" that came out as shaming your child? Sorry, but that just sounds like you being overly melodramatic and critical. \n\nIt's a child's email. Getting the vapors over it is ridiculous. If it affects you that badly, quit slacking on the parenting and get him to read more.", "YTA. \"State of shock\" over an 8 year old making spelling mistakes? Congrats on giving the kid trust issues and congrats on the senior living home later in life. \n\nMy \"instinctive, horrified response\" to this post is thank fuck I'm not in your family.", "This. Yes. Let\u2019s not forget Bob Dylan was barely literate but is still remembered as one of the greatest lyricists ever.", "The email didn't contain anything deeply personal or sensitive. He was discussing a recent family holiday, his classes, and who his new best friend at school is - topics that we're all openly aware of within the family.", "Okay? Really thought provoking \ud83d\udc4d"]}
