Not that long for an adult but there was a mom with 4 kids that appeared to all be under 6 years old. I was on the back of the bus wearing wired earbuds the whole time. I figured I had a lot of time to kill so time to listen to Coheed & Cambria's entire discography on a loop until I get there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was in the back just looking out the window not even remotely paying attention. I would glance over and see the kids going crazy in the seat and the mother trying to keep them all calm and together. But I was just in my own world. All the kids are fine and nothing bad happened to them but there was a few times I guess something happened and I didn't prevent it. Note that the whole time I am not paying attention. I have music at full blast and am either zoning out or looking out the window. One time the youngest one was standing on top of the seat like the part where you lean on and was about to jump off(I didn't see this happening because I was just zoning out. It's a long ride) The mother said I  was rude for not watching out. I didn't hear her so she walked over and tapped my shoulder and said repeated that again. I was kind of half listening and had music on still. So I just didn't say anything and went back to what I was doing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother time when we were transferring to another bus she was trying to get my attention to ask ME to watch her kids while she used the bathroom. But I just had my headphones on and walked to get snacks/restroom/freshen up. When we got on the new bus she told me I was rude again. A few more things like this happened during the trip. Don't know why she was expecting me to watch or singling me out about this. Like to me it's already weird enough to expect strangers to keep and eye on your kids but this was a bus full of people. Why was it up to me specifically?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother time I was eating chips. I had a big family size bag and I guess the kids were trying to get my attention to ask for some chips. Eventually the mom came over and tapped my shoulder and was like \"I shouldn't have to do this to get your attention?\" I was like \"why do you need my attention this much?\" and she was upset but said her kids wanted some chips. So they held out their hands and I poured some in each of their palms. Don't mind sharing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have no experience with kids and don't plan on having any. I am normally not this absent minded but this was a long ass ride so I was just zoning out to make the time go by. But even if I wasn't I think it's rude to expect others to watch your kids. And to expect ME specifically with a bus full of people.
