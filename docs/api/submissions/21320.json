Not that long for an adult but there was a mom with 4 kids that appeared to all be under 6 years old. I was on the back of the bus wearing wired earbuds the whole time. I figured I had a lot of time to kill so time to listen to Coheed & Cambria's entire discography on a loop until I get there.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was in the back just looking out the window not even remotely paying attention. I would glance over and see the kids going crazy in the seat and the mother trying to keep them all calm and together. But I was just in my own world. All the kids are fine and nothing bad happened to them but there was a few times I guess something happened and I didn't prevent it. Note that the whole time I am not paying attention. I have music at full blast and am either zoning out or looking out the window. One time the youngest one was standing on top of the seat like the part where you lean on and was about to jump off(I didn't see this happening because I was just zoning out. It's a long ride) The mother said I  was rude for not watching out. I didn't hear her so she walked over and tapped my shoulder and said repeated that again. I was kind of half listening and had music on still. So I just didn't say anything and went back to what I was doing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother time when we were transferring to another bus she was trying to get my attention to ask ME to watch her kids while she used the bathroom. But I just had my headphones on and walked to get snacks/restroom/freshen up. When we got on the new bus she told me I was rude again. A few more things like this happened during the trip. Don't know why she was expecting me to watch or singling me out about this. Like to me it's already weird enough to expect strangers to keep and eye on your kids but this was a bus full of people. Why was it up to me specifically?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnother time I was eating chips. I had a big family size bag and I guess the kids were trying to get my attention to ask for some chips. Eventually the mom came over and tapped my shoulder and was like \"I shouldn't have to do this to get your attention?\" I was like \"why do you need my attention this much?\" and she was upset but said her kids wanted some chips. So they held out their hands and I poured some in each of their palms. Don't mind sharing. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have no experience with kids and don't plan on having any. I am normally not this absent minded but this was a long ass ride so I was just zoning out to make the time go by. But even if I wasn't I think it's rude to expect others to watch your kids. And to expect ME specifically with a bus full of people. When I got to my destination I told my parents about this and they said I should have watched the kids", "created_utc": 1688484211, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14qi5ao/aita_for_not_watching_or_keeping_kids_from_danger/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're not responsible for her kids. You're not required to respond when strangers talk to you. It's not rude.

I'm a single mom and would never expect someone to watch my child for me while travelling. \n\nHonestly next time something like this happens say the first time loud and clear that you don't know her and that it isn't your job to watch her kids!

I'm sorry but the way people are nowadays, minding your own business is best and most parents don't want others telling their kids what to do anyway. You have far more patience than I do though in remaining calm while the mother was harassing you - NTA", "NTA \n\nI get why your parents would say you should have watched them especially if they are people pleasers. It\u2019s always easy to volunteer someone else for something. As parents you have a tendency to notice most kids in your surroundings. It\u2019s just a habit you pick up from watching your own kids. You start picking up on kids walking too close to the street walking around with scissors or how many kids are playing in a yard with a ball (it\u2019s scary how many times I\u2019ve noticed a kid run out into the street after a ball without looking for cars.) \n\nHowever it\u2019s not your responsibility to watch someone\u2019s kids for them. You are a stranger and maybe you saying something or offering to help would have turned out so different maybe she starts screaming at you to mind your business maybe she \u201cgoes to the restroom\u201d and never comes back because ooh this nice person will watch them for the ride while she takes a break. \n\nIt was plain rude of her to keep bothering you when you obviously were just trying to have a relaxing trip yourself. She was very entitled and I would wonder why you shared your chips at all (but I\u2019m chunky and that would have been the last straw for me hahah)", "NTA. Her kids are her responsibility and hers only. She singled you out because you are young and female therefore the best babysitter.  You are not at all obligated to watch her kids because they are not your responsibility.", "NTA. There's a certain type of entitled parent, usually the mother, the expects the world to to revolve around them because they have kids.
