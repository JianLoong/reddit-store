Sara has a friend, Gary, who is gay and makes it a point he\u2019s into me when he\u2019s around. Gary is very out there with the things he says, once he told my girlfriend as I was next to her, \u201cI bet his dick is huge\u201d and another night complimented my ass well over 10 times, and \u201cjokingly\u201d said I could stay at his place. Every time in the past I\u2019ve just brushed it off because my girlfriend and her mom have told me that\u2019s just how he is. \n\nNow to bowling and drinking. Gary drives all four of us to the bowling alley.  We bowl a few games, have a few drinks, everything is good for well over 2 hours. After we bowl we all went to a bar to continue drinking and enjoy the night. Another hour goes by and we\u2019re all pretty drunk. Gary plays a very sexual song on the jukebox and begins singing/rapping it to me, okay. 10-15 minutes later, Gary tells my girlfriend, again as I\u2019m standing next to her and can hear him, \u201cI\u2019m going to be the one to suck his dick at his bachelor party.\u201d I gave Kay the thats too much for me look and Gary saw, Gary moved away elsewhere. 5-10 minutes after that, Gary is standing next to a random bar dweller (40M) behind me and Kay. Kay is sitting on a chair, I\u2019m leaned over it behind her, and Gary grabs my ass but deep enough to touch my balls a little bit. I don\u2019t know how to explain the gesture but basically rubbed his hand from my balls up to my ass, squeezed my ass and let go. When that happened I turned around and said \u201cIf you do that again there will be a problem. I promise.\u201d with a pretty angry look on my face. Gary said nothing in response. I then told my girlfriend I was ready to leave and call it a night. I was uncomfortable and kind of upset Kay or Sara didn\u2019t say anything in response to Gary touching me. Sara, her mother, did not want us to leave but I got an Uber for Kay and I and shortly after we left.\n\nA couple hours later, Gary had texted Kay telling her I was homophobic for what I said. Gary and Sara were still at the bar. There was absolutely no reason to text her that. Kay did not respond to him, but now there\u2019s tension between all of us. Sara took Gary\u2019s side. I\u2019m upset nobody else stood up for me, and Kay is basically ignoring the entire thing, saying that\u2019s how he is and she doesn\u2019t want to drag on further. I\u2019m left wondering if I\u2019m in the wrong for snapping at Gary. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691983473, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15qix8a/aita_for_telling_a_gay_man_if_he_touched_me_again/", "score": 424, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he was a straight man saying that to a straight woman and grabbing her cooch and squeezing, it would be sexual assault. Which it was with you. Gary stepped way over the line and I know a few gay men who like to hide behind 'you're homophobic if you call me out on my shit'. Fuck no. Tell Kay \"Honey, your mom's friend sexually assaulted me. If a guy did that to you, you'd be livid. I'd be livid. Why is it any different when he does it to me? Because YOU know I'm not attracted to him? I also know you're not attracted to some jackass at a bar groping you, but it's not right, especially if you don't like it. If a woman had come up and done the same thing to me, would you be mad then? I don't want him sexually touching me, sexually making comments, and then blaming me for not being a perfect victim.

Doesn't matter what someone's sexual orientation is, you don't fucking touch someone without consent.", "NTA. He assaulted you. It has nothing to do with his sexual orientation. If a woman grabbed your ass and junk it would be no different. The behavior you described is repulsive, regardless of who was invoked. \n\nThe whole situation sounds really creepy to me. I\u2019ll even go a step further and say that your gf  and her mom are gross for not drawing a hard line when he was harassing you\u2026 which obviously allowed him to escalate to assaulting you. \n\nI really hope your gf rethinks her priorities because of the roles we\u2019re reversed she\u2019d be looking for emotional support from you\u2026. Fuck who does that kind of think to someone?!?", "NTA\n\nThis is sexual assault, and I\u2019m glad you spoke up because so few men feel they can\u2019t as to \u201cnot appear weak\u201d\n\nI\u2019m a gay man, and I would NEVER in a million years lay my hands on someone without consent\u2026 especially a straight man, as I feel behaviour like that pushes back equality for our community.\n\nYour GF needs to realize that she\u2019s perpetuating a crime by not supporting you.", "NTA.  You made that comment because he was harassing you, not because he is gay.  Being gay isn\u2019t a free pass to sexual harass someone.", "NTA\n\nThis is sexual assault... nothing less... \nIf this was done with a woman, and I say this as a woman myself, the house would have been too small. \nYou gave on several times that you do not apprexiate the comments. \nThe touching is too far.\nSorry but thats the equivalent of grabbing a woman between her legs and I know for a fact I would turn around and slap a handprint tattoo on the guys face. \nIt is NOT homephobic to be against being touched in such a way. Because 100% sure you wouldnt have appreciated a 40 year old woman doing that. \nThey keep saying that is how he is? \nI would sit your gf down and talk with her. She should be on your side. She is your partner. \nWhen my bf feels uncomfortable I will not force him further but stop whatever makes him uncomfortable. You need to sit her down and ask why she can not understand your point of view and ask how it would be if a man double her age cups her.\nSorry but if I am in your place I would have filed a policereport against Gary. \nAnd your gf and her mom should see that. \n\nAbsolutely NTA and stay faarr away from that monster.", "NTA I don't care what gender you are or what your sexual orientation is, that is absolutely sexual assault. I'm queer and it really infuriates me when people try to claim others are phobic in response to any perceived slight. Truly disgusting and I'd be wary of your girlfriend as well. She is not taking this seriously enough. She should be pissed too. She should have your back.", "NTA \n\nWe only needed to read the 2nd paragraph. This is sexual harassment.\n\nJust read the rest out of curiosity. This is actual sexual assault. It would have been a fight if it was me. A violent one.\n\nWho knows who else he hurt.

Wow.\n\nNTA", "File a police report", "NTA. That's sexual harassment and total a-holery. You are totally in the right here.", "NTA you were sexually harassed.

Calling out the homophobic card on the person theatre was sexually assaulted - numerous times after clearly being told you are not interested - is predatory and disgusting.\n\nNTA, and I suggest telling you girlfriend that if she doesn't have a word to her mother about her friend, you are more than willing to take out a restraining order. You have no idea what he is willing to do to \"convert\" a straight man. Will he roofy you? Will he physically force you? He already attacked you once in a public place.\n\nAt the very least, go to the police and get a restraining order. That will wake your girlfriend and her mother up - if this happened to a woman, he would be in cuffs so fast his head would spin. The fact your a male should make no difference.", "NTA- telling someone to stop sexually assaulting you, groping you, or any unwanted gestures is not homophobic. Your friends taking the Sex Offenders side it also alarming. It doesn\u2019t matter if you are gay, straight, bi, black , white , blue, male or female, this was sexual assault/harassment. Do not apologize to anyone, if they want want to continue to hang out with someone who gropes others inappropriately, that is them. Sexual Assault *is* NOT a joke. Being touched unwillingly, and inappropriately is not a joke. You are not wrong for stopping someone sexually assaulting you. How would they feel if a lesbian came from behind and put their hand between their legs and grab their breast inappropriately without consent ?

You wouldn't be the AH if you smacked the dog shit out of him. He assaulted you. No warning required.", "Nta. Gary fucking sexually assaulted you. I'm a woman, and if a guy or a lesbian did that to me you bet I would be way less nice about it than you were. I'd be throwing hands, or drinks, or at the very least insults. Just because you are both men it doesn't make it any less bad. Kay's mom is an enabler and the fact that she is friends with such a predatory man tells me enough about her character. Kay probably is not doing anything because going against Gary would equal going against her mom and she probably doesn't want that but this is one of those situations where she should take a stand regardless of how it might damage her relationship with her mom. *That man is unsafe and they should not keep validating and enabling him*. If I were her I would be extremely upset at someone coming onto my boyfriend like that all the time, regardless of their gender.", "NTA. That is sexual assault.

Being gay doesn't mean anyone can get away with sexual harassment. Neither protesting against sexual harassment by a gay man makes you homophobic. That man does give gay men a bad reputation thanks to his antics.\n\nAs for your GF and her mother, it does feel that they care less about you. They neither told off Gary nor got annoyed with him.

He sexually harassed and sexually assaulted you and when you call him I on it you get called homophobic!? It\u2019s bullshit. \n\nRegardless of sexuality or gender there still need to be considerations about where and what the line of appropriate is. Gary shot well past that line.\n\nSomethings may be taken as a joke but that\u2019s for the person on the receiving end (OP) to decide.

My personal belief is if someone sexually assaults you, you may use whatever you have to defend yourself. I'm disgusted your girlfriend thinks this behavior is okay and isn't telling him off. Maybe tell her from now on you want nothing to do with Gary and if he's present or shows up, you will leave, with her or without her. Then stick to that boundary. You may end up losing the relationship but i don't think that would be a bad thing considering her disrespect towards you.", "NTA\nThat's sexual assault and you would be entitled to report him to the police and maybe you should, as he is clearly a sexual predator.

I'm so sorry this happened to you.", "NTA - 27 Gay M here and I agree, it all sounds too far. It\u2019s okay to be attracted to someone without crossing boundaries or making them uncomfortable.

Being gay doesn\u2019t give you an excuse to touch people, especially when it\u2019s your a$$ and b@lls. That\u2019s sexual harassment.

I wish I could say something to make this go away other than you need to either report him or step away because people like this escalate.", "OP, you gotta break up with your gf because she doesn't see a problem, and Gary thinks sexual harassment is homophobic. Wonder Gary would feel if several girls started touching him in a sexually suggestive way. Would he think it's sexual harassment or accept that's how some girls are and believe some girls want his body.", "NTA. Point out to everyone involved that if a straight man was persistent like that with a woman from the friendship group, and then touched her in a sexual way, you would hope they would be equally condemned.", "Nta AT ALL. That wasn't in good fun, that wasn't a \"hey we're friends that are super comfortable with each other I'm gonna grab your butt in a playful manner\" I would go as far as to say that is sexual assault. If a guy did that to a girl, and she said that to him, everyone would be cheering her on and the guy would probably have some trouble to deal with for putting a woman in that situation. He's taking advantage of the fact that these people trust him and making it about something the situation has nothing to do with so that he doesn't look like a bad guy. The fact that no one sees that that is not okay is bullshit, and the fact that your girlfriend isn't standing up for you and is just saying \"that's how he is\" is DISGUSTING. It's like saying \"boys will be boys\" as an excuse when a guy commits sexual assault/harassment or rape. You were not in the wrong at all here, if anything you handled it much better than most people would have", "You are a better man than me because I would have thrown hands after I got groped like that by another man. NTA. He sexually assaulted you, but others are letting him get away with it because of hi sexuality.", "NTA Gary is the AH. Being an AH is not a protected class. He\u2019s out of line and knows it. Mom is an AH for not holding him accountable for his offensive behavior.", "Obviously NTA. You didn't do anything but speak up for yourself, though much later than you should have. He's the one who sexually assaulted you.  Him being gay doesn't even matter except to set up context as to why he did what he did. It isn't a pass to be vile", "OP having dealt with it in work places where many straight women did it to me trying to get me to \"change over\" numerous times as a gay man was tiring because management kept saying it's no big deal when sexual harassment against men wasn't taken seriously compared to these days because it was decades ago.  Today you're in a social situation here, so you just cut off Gary from your outings - period.  If you keep hanging out with him, you're encouraging it to happen.  It's a challenge because because he's thinking he can do the same thing as these women thought they could do to me.  You eliminate the opportunity, you take away his power.  You physically harm him, it could not only lead to physical assault but also a potential hate crime charges which is worse.  Just avoid him because otherwise he won't stop because it's his challenge and eventually he'll move onto someone else.", "NTA but your gf and GFS mum are for letting gary do and say whatever he wants. It's disgusting and he's disgusting", "NTA, and it sounds like your girlfriend and her mom are enablers of his predatory behavior.", "Anyone who backs him should be cut from your life. Dude doesn't get to assault you, blame you, and get defended. Screw that noise. NTA - sorry bro", "Sounds like you need a new gf. I would never be ok with my bf being sexually assaulted and saying \"that's just how he is\". That's so heartless and insensitive to say!!!!!", "NTA this is sexual harassment and it's disgusting. He doesn't get a pass just because he is gay.", "That sexual assault. Your girlfriend is an asshole for not defending you and for not taking into consideration beforehand that you were uncomfortable with this man.

Sara has a friend, Gary, who is gay and makes it a point he\u2019s into me when he\u2019s around. Gary is very out there with the things he says, once he told my girlfriend as I was next to her, \u201cI bet his dick is huge\u201d and another night complimented my ass well over 10 times, and \u201cjokingly\u201d said I could stay at his place. Every time in the past I\u2019ve just brushed it off because my girlfriend and her mom have told me that\u2019s just how he is. \n\nNow to bowling and drinking. Gary drives all four of us to the bowling alley.  We bowl a few games, have a few drinks, everything is good for well over 2 hours. After we bowl we all went to a bar to continue drinking and enjoy the night. Another hour goes by and we\u2019re all pretty drunk. Gary plays a very sexual song on the jukebox and begins singing/rapping it to me, okay. 10-15 minutes later, Gary tells my girlfriend, again as I\u2019m standing next to her and can hear him, \u201cI\u2019m going to be the one to suck his dick at his bachelor party.\u201d I gave Kay the thats too much for me look and Gary saw, Gary moved away elsewhere. 5-10 minutes after that, Gary is standing next to a random bar dweller (40M) behind me and Kay. Kay is sitting on a chair, I\u2019m leaned over it behind her, and Gary grabs my ass but deep enough to touch my balls a little bit. I don\u2019t know how to explain the gesture but basically rubbed his hand from my balls up to my ass, squeezed my ass and let go. When that happened I turned around and said \u201cIf you do that again there will be a problem. I promise.\u201d with a pretty angry look on my face. Gary said nothing in response. I then told my girlfriend I was ready to leave and call it a night. I was uncomfortable and kind of upset Kay or Sara didn\u2019t say anything in response to Gary touching me. Sara, her mother, did not want us to leave but I got an Uber for Kay and I and shortly after we left.\n\nA couple hours later, Gary had texted Kay telling her I was homophobic for what I said. Gary and Sara were still at the bar. There was absolutely no reason to text her that. Kay did not respond to him, but now there\u2019s tension between all of us. Sara took Gary\u2019s side. I\u2019m upset nobody else stood up for me, and Kay is basically ignoring the entire thing, saying that\u2019s how he is and she doesn\u2019t want to drag on further. I\u2019m left wondering if I\u2019m in the wrong for snapping at Gary. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Between the three of you, you are obviously at the bottom of the totem pole.  Do yourself a favor and get out of the relationship.
