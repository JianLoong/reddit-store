I (33f) have been married to my husband (35m) for a little over a year. We came from very different financial situations. I\u2019ve never had any debt and have support from my family while he, an immigrant, came here on a student visa and ended up with a lot of credit card and student loan debt. These were being charged at very high percentages and so I decided to help him out with a low interest loan from one of my accounts. Privileged, I know. Anyway. The loan was supposed to be for 5 years but somehow the terms were set to 3 years. My husband is supposed to be setting aside money a month to pay the loan at the close date (cannot pay monthly). Last night I, albeit at a bad time, got frustrated that he was talking about spending money on things we don\u2019t need and expensive things for his family members gifts. I asked him about this and how much he had saved toward the loan. He got upset, told me it isn\u2019t any of my business and accused me of ruining his night. I know it\u2019s a sensitive topic but as the loaner I do think I have a right to ask. He ended up telling me that he saved as much as he could, and that he was counting on what I had previously mentioned of taking out an additional loan at the end of the first loan term to cover what he couldn\u2019t save. Here is what worried me. I felt like he\u2019s living off this money with the plan to just continue rolling over the debt, nearly in full. He\u2019s offering to also buy me expensive gifts and pay a larger portion of the rent, but I am starting to feel like that\u2019s me buying things for myself on loan. We\u2019re now in a fight and he has said no more paying a higher portion of the rent and no more nice gifts but he\u2019ll return the money at term and no longer trust me or count on me. I feel manipulated and hurt. He feels betrayed and angry.

It may behoove you to open a joint account where he can deposit money monthly toward this loan payment, that you can then move to another account he can't withdraw from.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband behaved really badly though. You have the right to ask and especially as your husband, he should be more considerate, respectful and self-reflected. \n\nYou were trying to communicate with him. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA. Op, did you see how he turned the argument around on you, making you look like the bad guy for asking a reasonable question? Its YOUR money, you have a right to know after a couple of years when its gonna come back.\n\nop, you may need to talk to a financial adviser *without your husband* and what to do next.", "NTA\n\nHe thought he could just buy you nice stuff and you will forget about the loan lol", "NTA - Your husband is a deadbeat who certainly won't pay what he owes you. The correct thing would be to have regularized this loan through a contract. And if he doesn't pay, use the document as a debt collection instrument in court.\n\nThat's why you shouldn't lend money to friends and relatives, here's a tip for those in the same situation.", "No, he's the asshole and I'd suggest getting some sort of counseling for him because wow, what a user.", "NTA.  You'll never get the money back.  Cut him loose and move on.  Hope you don't have any kids.", "NTA. To start, I\u2019m confused by a loan that can\u2019t be paid monthly. But, at bare minimum, he could be putting an agreed upon amount\nIn a shared account so you can see that he is saving. Different attitudes about money are a huge source of conflict in a marriage. The fact that he sees holding him to the terms of the loans as a reason he can \u201cno longer trust or count on you\u201d Is a huge red flag.", "NTA.  Red flag alert!  You're wandering close to that sunken cost fallacy.   If you really love this guy, consider letting go of this debt. If you're wanting your money back as originally planned, I'd be getting outside professional opinions.  Your SO is shifty. He doesn't need to be showing off to his family with big gifts when he has big debt..says a little about his character too", "NTA run. He\u2019s a manipulative scammer.  I bet he love bombed you.", "NTA.   Did he save any money  to pay you back,?", "He can\u2019t pay you monthly, but he save money monthly? How does this work? NTA. But I fear you will see not a cent of the loan and I hope you have a prenup", "I come from a place of having lent a significant amount of money to my boyfriend. It was help he required to make a downpayment for a mortgage, he paid me back almost half of it from bonuses and the rest is noted down in his finance notebook, which in his case means he remembers and respects what I did. While we\u2019re not married or even engaged, I live in the apartment I helped him buy, he made it my home from day one, and he inspires me to believe I made the right call. At this point, I don\u2019t see myself asking for the rest of the money back - unless we break up, which I don\u2019t see coming anytime soon either.\n\nYour husband does not inspire trust in the slightest. I think it\u2019s time you guys have a serious conversation about the future of this debt. Either you let it go or he starts taking it seriously, but you need to get on the same page, otherwise it\u2019s gonna continue to be a problem between you. NTA", "NTA.

He doesn't intend ever to pay you back. He probably thinks you should just cover all his debt without paying you back. \n\nI suggest you set up a monthly payment plan. There is no excuse for him being so undisciplined when he has so much debt. Buying expensive gifts is something he can't afford to do.", "I hope you had a contract made up.\nYour husband does sound manipulative.\n\nYNTA at all but hubby sure is.\n\nDon't spend any money on hunny since he thinks your the manipulative one.", "NTA but you need him to start paying you weekly/fortnightly/monthly. Trust me he will not have any money saved up at the end of the term. You are correct, it is in fact your money paying for your gifts. Please, get him to start paying you NOW. You can keep it in your account if you can't pay it towards the loan. And do not let him take another loan (I'm assuming it would be in your name again) to pay off the first one, NO WAY.  If he feels betrayed & angry, that only means he has been using you and he is angry  you're starting to see it. Please don't let him.", "NTA. sounds like you actually have this contract & timeframe in writing thank fuck. anticipate needing to take legal action because it seems like he doesn\u2019t give a shit about giving your money back. he\u2019s being super manipulative, i hope you see that. coming to him with a genuine grievance & he turns it around trying to make you seem like the bad guy. maybe he\u2019s just bad with money but that interaction alone is a serious red flag. & even if it is just him being irresponsible, i\u2019d seriously reconsider a serious relationship with someone like that, especially since you\u2019re in your 30s.", "NTA.  Watch out for this grifter.", "NTA. He needs to pay it back on time period. Do not accept anything less and do not loan him anymore money.", "NTA.\n\nThis is sadly a pretty common situation when people with no financial education get married.\n\nHe's so used to being poor that he now wants to overcompensate by pretending to be a millionaire and flaunt his wealth. He's desperately trying to pretend to be someone he's not.\n\nPeople like this only think short-term. He knows nothing about savings, investments, etc.\n\nThere's a reason banks want to charge him insane interest rates: because he can't be trusted with money.\n\nYou can be trusted. That's why banks are giving you a better deal. But if you keep bailing him out, you're going to get pulled down to his level.\n\nNext time, no more loans. No helping him out financially. If he has to eat 2 minute noodles and catch a bus to work, so be it. He needs to learn some humility.", "Open a separate account and ask him every month to put the money towards the loan in it. He should not be able to take it out", "This is a problematic situation. How can you expect to have a life together going forward if you have radically different financial statuses and you don't merge your finances?\n\nFrom your perspective, every time you don't get a payment you hold it against him. (And by the way, why can't he pay you monthly?)\n\nFrom his perspective, he believes, and rightly so, that you are judging him for all his choices and holding his financial dependence on you over his head.\n\nMaybe he did marry you for your money, but it also sounds as though neither of you really thought about how this would play out as you went forward in your life together. Think of it: are you really going to sue your husband when he inevitably doesn't have the money to pay you back? Do you think that will be good for your marriage?\n\nYou need to get a clearer sense of how you will live together in the future or you might as well call it quits now.", "NTA. This is clearly a case of financial AND emotional manipulation. Unless he actually returns the money at term, he\u2019s probably only saying that to make you feel guilty. Don\u2019t fall for it. \n\nYou have no reason to feel bad because he came from a different financial background and/or doesn\u2019t have the same amount of money as you do to be generous with.", "ESH why would you loan someone money when they\u2019re already in debt. you wouldn\u2019t give a loan to a gambler. especially one that was a friend. never loan money to a friend", "ESH. The hubby is being hostile but the \u2018terms\u2019 of your loan to him are ridiculous and controlling in a weird way. \u201cPay me a lump sum in 5 years\u201d.", "\u2018Behoove\u2019. I approve.", "It\u2019s in our prenup", "We don\u2019t", "Yes the term is that it gets paid in full at a certain date.", "It sounds almost like a heloc.  That's credit taken on with a house on collateral.  If I remember right, you pay interest monthly, but whatever was taken out is due in full at the end of the term, or you can apply for a new one.  I know ours had closing fees, though, that would need to be paid to open a second one.", "We do", "It\u2019s not that he can\u2019t pay me. The loan is only repayable at the end of the term so you can\u2019t make payments towards it.", "I assisted with it through a loan through my bank", "Hopefully I spelled it right. Haha.", "The loan is in your prenup? So you are protected from him not paying you back? \n\nIf so then good, because it sure does sound like you are being taken for a ride here.", "But you could open an account in your name and he pays monthly into it. And you use this money to pay it. And than you would know, how things are. If he pays good amounts, you would have your peace of mind when he wants to buy expensive stuff.", "Ok, the original post made it sound like you loaned him the money directly", "Yeah I think that would be the case", "That would be the ideal but he won\u2019t do it", "If I were you: if he wants to have so much as a conversation about a new loan down the line, that would be my condition. He can accept or find another solution to pay you."]}
