I (33f) have been married to my husband (35m) for a little over a year. We came from very different financial situations. I\u2019ve never had any debt and have support from my family while he, an immigrant, came here on a student visa and ended up with a lot of credit card and student loan debt. These were being charged at very high percentages and so I decided to help him out with a low interest loan from one of my accounts (through a bank). Privileged, I know. Anyway. The loan was supposed to be for 5 years but somehow the terms were set to 3 years. My husband is supposed to be setting aside money a month to pay the loan at the close date (cannot pay monthly). Last night I, albeit at a bad time, got frustrated that he was talking about spending money on things we don\u2019t need and expensive things for his family members gifts. I asked him about this and how much he had saved toward the loan. He got upset, told me it isn\u2019t any of my business and accused me of ruining his night. I know it\u2019s a sensitive topic but as the loaner I do think I have a right to ask. He ended up telling me that he saved as much as he could, and that he was counting on what I had previously mentioned of taking out an additional loan at the end of the first loan term to cover what he couldn\u2019t save. Here is what worried me. I felt like he\u2019s living off this money with the plan to just continue rolling over the debt, nearly in full. He\u2019s offering to also buy me expensive gifts and pay a larger portion of the rent, but I am starting to feel like that\u2019s me buying things for myself on loan. We\u2019re now in a fight and he has said no more paying a higher portion of the rent and no more nice gifts but he\u2019ll return the money at term and no longer trust me or count on me. I feel manipulated and hurt. He feels betrayed and angry. AITA?????\n\nEdit - we have a prenup. This loan is in there. It\u2019s an official loan from a bank against my securities. Not my terms.

He doesn't intend ever to pay you back. He probably thinks you should just cover all his debt without paying you back. \n\nI suggest you set up a monthly payment plan. There is no excuse for him being so undisciplined when he has so much debt. Buying expensive gifts is something he can't afford to do.", "I hope you had a contract made up.\nYour husband does sound manipulative.\n\nYNTA at all but hubby sure is.\n\nDon't spend any money on hunny since he thinks your the manipulative one.", "NTA but you need him to start paying you weekly/fortnightly/monthly. Trust me he will not have any money saved up at the end of the term. You are correct, it is in fact your money paying for your gifts. Please, get him to start paying you NOW. You can keep it in your account if you can't pay it towards the loan. And do not let him take another loan (I'm assuming it would be in your name again) to pay off the first one, NO WAY.  If he feels betrayed & angry, that only means he has been using you and he is angry  you're starting to see it. Please don't let him.", "NTA. sounds like you actually have this contract & timeframe in writing thank fuck. anticipate needing to take legal action because it seems like he doesn\u2019t give a shit about giving your money back. he\u2019s being super manipulative, i hope you see that. coming to him with a genuine grievance & he turns it around trying to make you seem like the bad guy. maybe he\u2019s just bad with money but that interaction alone is a serious red flag. & even if it is just him being irresponsible, i\u2019d seriously reconsider a serious relationship with someone like that, especially since you\u2019re in your 30s.", "NTA.  Watch out for this grifter.", "NTA. He needs to pay it back on time period. Do not accept anything less and do not loan him anymore money.", "NTA.\n\nThis is sadly a pretty common situation when people with no financial education get married.\n\nHe's so used to being poor that he now wants to overcompensate by pretending to be a millionaire and flaunt his wealth. He's desperately trying to pretend to be someone he's not.\n\nPeople like this only think short-term. He knows nothing about savings, investments, etc.\n\nThere's a reason banks want to charge him insane interest rates: because he can't be trusted with money.\n\nYou can be trusted. That's why banks are giving you a better deal. But if you keep bailing him out, you're going to get pulled down to his level.\n\nNext time, no more loans. No helping him out financially. If he has to eat 2 minute noodles and catch a bus to work, so be it. He needs to learn some humility.", "Open a separate account and ask him every month to put the money towards the loan in it. He should not be able to take it out", "This is a problematic situation. How can you expect to have a life together going forward if you have radically different financial statuses and you don't merge your finances?\n\nFrom your perspective, every time you don't get a payment you hold it against him. (And by the way, why can't he pay you monthly?)\n\nFrom his perspective, he believes, and rightly so, that you are judging him for all his choices and holding his financial dependence on you over his head.\n\nMaybe he did marry you for your money, but it also sounds as though neither of you really thought about how this would play out as you went forward in your life together. Think of it: are you really going to sue your husband when he inevitably doesn't have the money to pay you back? Do you think that will be good for your marriage?\n\nYou need to get a clearer sense of how you will live together in the future or you might as well call it quits now.", "NTA. This is clearly a case of financial AND emotional manipulation. Unless he actually returns the money at term, he\u2019s probably only saying that to make you feel guilty. Don\u2019t fall for it. \n\nYou have no reason to feel bad because he came from a different financial background and/or doesn\u2019t have the same amount of money as you do to be generous with.", "ESH why would you loan someone money when they\u2019re already in debt. you wouldn\u2019t give a loan to a gambler. especially one that was a friend. never loan money to a friend", "ESH. The hubby is being hostile but the \u2018terms\u2019 of your loan to him are ridiculous and controlling in a weird way. \u201cPay me a lump sum in 5 years\u201d.", "\u2018Behoove\u2019. I approve.", "It\u2019s in our prenup", "We don\u2019t", "Yes the term is that it gets paid in full at a certain date.", "It sounds almost like a heloc.  That's credit taken on with a house on collateral.  If I remember right, you pay interest monthly, but whatever was taken out is due in full at the end of the term, or you can apply for a new one.  I know ours had closing fees, though, that would need to be paid to open a second one.", "We do", "It\u2019s not that he can\u2019t pay me. The loan is only repayable at the end of the term so you can\u2019t make payments towards it.", "I assisted with it through a loan through my bank", "Hopefully I spelled it right. Haha.", "The loan is in your prenup? So you are protected from him not paying you back? \n\nIf so then good, because it sure does sound like you are being taken for a ride here.", "But you could open an account in your name and he pays monthly into it. And you use this money to pay it. And than you would know, how things are. If he pays good amounts, you would have your peace of mind when he wants to buy expensive stuff.", "Ok, the original post made it sound like you loaned him the money directly", "Yeah I think that would be the case", "That would be the ideal but he won\u2019t do it", "If I were you: if he wants to have so much as a conversation about a new loan down the line, that would be my condition. He can accept or find another solution to pay you.", "And that's why more and more married couples keep their finances separate. He's barely one year in the marriage and he already got comfortable and is trying to guilt trip you into forgetting the debt. Are you his partner or his cash cow? He has no right to feel betrayed, and he's only angry because you called him out. If the amount was small, I'd let it go for the sake of love but I have a feeling it's a lot of money. And even if you could afford to let it go, I'm not sure you should, because he betrayed your trust and doesn't want to keep his word. He's taking advantage of you and this alone would make me reconsider the whole relationship. Look for other red flags. Don't buy a house with him. And wait before you have kids.\n\nEdit: seems like OP is smart and has a prenup. Good for you. You both need to have a serious conversation. Ask him to set up an automatic bank transfer at the beginning of every month so that he's not tempted to use the money that he should set aside.", "NTA- the clue is when he tried to tell you it was none of his business.  I would respond that\n\nOur finance are absolutely my business. Further, I am hurt and betrayed that you are not holding up to your end of things and instead trying to spend the money you owe on frivolous things or gifts that you cannot afford. Further, I don't give a shit that you claim you're angry. You have nothing to be angry about- you are acting without any integrity and the reality is that you are embarrassed at your own actions and that you have been called out. The appropriate response is for you to get some humility and take appropriate action to rectify your spending behavior otherwise I can only assume that you are hoping to manipulate me further, which I will not accept.", "NTA. The only thing I see at this stage is for you to open an account under your name to which he deposits every month an amount used to pay back the loan. No ifs or buts. As for what he pays or doesn't pay in your relationship, make a very clear statement: he pays half the rent and utilities and food because duh, he doesn't shower you with gifts because what's the point but he also doesn't make a point to not buy you presents for xmas or your bday or if he feels like because it's a marriage. If he threatens, blackmails or attacks you, it is a major red flag and you are allowed to tell him as much. You took out a loan for him, he is supposed to be serious about it. If he struggles, he can tell you. But if he spends too much because he figures that you'll deal with the loan then that's very much not ok.", "NTA, but don't let these people convince you to leave your hubby so quick. Sounds like he could use some financial coaching, it's a good opportunity for you to help mold him into someone who thinks about & manages money in a similar fashion as you. You made a gesture out of love, and you're protected; have some faith in him, but I agree that you may want to set a threshold of rolling over the debt. Good luck, OP", "NTA excellent! Yes to paying it back on term. If he doesn't trust or count on you any longer, because you are being fiscally responsible, then that is an entire parade of red flags on red floats with red wheels. Socioeconomic differences matter, perhaps he truly doesn't understand what a loan is or how they work? In any case, glad to hear he is going to pay it back on time \ud83d\ude4f", "Deadbeat most likely. Good luck.", "Uh, NTA. It literally doesn't work that way. He's supposed to be using the money towards his debt, not handing it right back to you intnhw form of purchases!", "NTA. The only difference between the loan having been set at 3 years vs 5 years is the time it took for this fight to happen.", "NTA.  I think your feelings and concerns are valid.  He said he would return the loan at the agreed upon term, so just wait and see if he fulfills his commitment.  See if the \u201cno more nice gifts\u201d rule also applies to his family, or just to you.\n\nINFO:  Do you have a prenuptial agreement in place?  It sounds like you keep your finances completely separate, so drawing up a post-nuptial agreement should be pretty straightforward from a legal standpoint.  Emotionally, not so much.  A marriage counselor could be helpful in that regard.", "NTA", "NTA and you have the right to know his financial situation because you're fucking MARRIED. Even if he didn't have this loan, him trying to hide major details about his finances is extremely concerning. He's not hiding that he buys a Frappuccino once a week, this is a loan that affects both of your finances significantly.", "NTA My goodness me how fast he turned it all around on you to make you the bad guy. A big attempt at DARVO there. Enough to actually get you confused enough to write on here. Yes you are 100% being manipulated. 'No longer trust, or count on you,' doesn't make any logical sense as something you are, but as projection it is absolutely himself he is talking about.", "NTA and i wouldn\u2019t be shocked if he hasn\u2019t saved a single penny of it tbh . It already had me raising my brows at you taking the loan for him in the first place but yano each to their own and all that .\n\nIf you\u2019re only a year into marriage I suggest making it a case of a year with lessons learned and get shot cos he doesn\u2019t sound like a great catch tbh", "Yta", "NTA\n\nOh poor girl... you are being used!", "Y\u2026.you charged your husband a loan with interest? I mean I would literally never with my spouse but I really love and trust them. I mean if you think he\u2019s gonna fuck you over then you gotta do what you gotta do, but idk", "Might be controversial but I'm going with ESH. He's obviously using you for your cash and capital, hoping to skate by on roll overs, but sweetheart, you picked him. You knew his status before you married him, you must have known that status would have risks attached to it. So that's on you.", "Just get divorced", "Yup.  That's what narcissists do, make their problems look like your fault.", "He was supposed to be putting it in a separate account monthly. The mistake I made is not having access to that account and that he can still withdraw from it. The comment about trust was becaus I had previously told him that if he couldn\u2019t make the full payment at term I would help him cycle the remainder. I recently became worried that because he isn\u2019t actually saving much that he wasn\u2019t planning to repay much of it rather than like, say, 3/4 of it. Hence the way the convo started", "That\u2019s what I was inquiring about when I got told that it\u2019s none of my business", "Yeah the annoying part is - this also means no flowers, no vacations, no dinner dates.", "THIS.", "This is the perfect response. Call out the manipulation for what it is and don\u2019t let it continue.", "Thank you for this balanced answer.", "I have worked on this with him and we now drive a much less expensive car etc. he never learned.  All he had when he came here were credit cards and student loans. He didn\u2019t have another choice really. But his spending to saving ratio is certainly off.", "This makes me very worried", "It was a genuine grievance but I approached it in an insensitive way.  Yes he\u2019s bad with money. He says he will return it at term and at this point I don\u2019t care if he has to take another 30% interest loan to do it.", "He\u2019s actually got a very good job. But we have a car payment, rent, he has a student loan etc etc", "Right and like if he thought he has five years he should plan to return 3/5 of it in 3 years if he planned properly. But I think he was counting on the rollover.", "Thank you for validating. We do have a prenup", "Lol, funny thing to pick at. The loan is against my securities at a bank where I hold money. Not my terms. He was supposed to save monthly payments in a savings account that he seems not to be doing.", "It\u2019s a bank loan.", "I\u2019m not merging them precisely because of how different our situations are. If he married me for my money he would have fought much harder against the prenup but it\u2019s still possible he has some expectations around my helping out or covering certain things.", "To cover the high interest debts. Like a refinance.", "I expected him to keep his word with saving the monthly payments and not spending them.", "Good. I would watch out for baby traps too.", "It\u2019s a loan against my securities (investments)", "No, it will be none of your business *next time*, when he takes out his own loan in his own name and deals with it himself. Because you aren\u2019t helping him again, of course. This time it is fully your business.", "Okay but at this point you\u2019re buying them for yourself anyway! \ud83e\udd23", "You do realize that at term, there\u2019s literally no way in hell he will go take another loan out to pay yours back, right? You act like you can force him to. He will simply not cooperate. And then you will pay it (if you can) to protect your credit.\n\nThis situation is a done deal. All that\u2019s left to decide is how you handle the same situation in the future. Hopefully you\u2019ve learned that he can\u2019t be trusted with the family finances, and if you want to, you can see past that (and manage the finances yourself) for the rest of the relationship. If financial responsibility was important for you in a partner then you married the wrong guy.", "Good then there is hope. You apparently are wondering what he has saved. Is there any reason for him to say it\u2019s none of your business? People who can be categorized as deadbeats don\u2019t have to be poor, they just don\u2019t like paying their debts. If he has a good paying job it is probably that he is prioritizing his creditors and you are perhaps his friendliest creditor so you are last on the list. Either way if he tells a creditor it\u2019s none of their business, and the creditor is his spouse, then it\u2019s pretty clear he feels you won\u2019t be satisfied with his answer. Good luck to both of you and hopefully it may work out.", "Oh wow yes I\u2019m sorry I misunderstood, completely NTA. He needs to prioritize paying off the loan and not putting the responsibility on you, you have every right to be pissed!!", "Child free all the way even before this", "Right.", "I\u2019m hopeful he will not put me in that position", "The reason is that he probably hasn\u2019t saved much, trying to keep up with our lifestyle. He was able to close most of his debts with the loan except the student loan and now only owes me.", "Sis, he is patently financially irresponsible. The moment you bailed him out was the moment that debt became 100% your responsibility. You won't see the money again.\n\nIf you want long term financial stability, it will never be with him. He has no reason to be responsible financially.", "Yeah this is what I wish I had done from the beginning. Deposits into a transparent joint account he cannot withdraw from."]}
