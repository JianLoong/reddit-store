Why is she even with you then? \n\nHowever, you did the right thing, so she was also an asshole, both of you were.\n\nMaybe you could rethink the wording that you use with Harri to describe the importance of your sons and ex. For example, you could say my sons are a top priority in my life, it's not that they are necessarily that they are more important, but perhaps you could get the same meaning across by saying they are very important to you, and as a responsible parent, you need to go do this task. \n\nOn the other hand, if your kids are not important to Harri, and one of them is as young as 3...

That\u2019s just something you just don\u2019t say. What? is current gf only going to be as important when she births out a kid? AH for speaking those words 100%.", "NTA and good riddance", "NTA. Your kids come first, keeping a good relationship with your ex comes first,  Harri doesn\u2019t have kids so she doesn\u2019t understand. She is the AH, so are her friends and her Mom for getting involved.", "Nta.  You are putting your kids before her, not your ex.  And if she has such an issue with your kids, there is really no future here for you and her.  She will always want to be #1.", "Your kids sure. That you said your EX will always come before your girlfriend of 2 years ...YTA for that.", "Trash took itself out. NTA", "NTA your GF is out of line. Those are your kids, you were parenting.", "NTA. Your girlfriend doesn't understand that the kids come first. I hope, someday, you find someone that does.", "You dodged a bullet, My friend. Let the relationship end. It will only get worse with the new GF and the kids from here on out if you stay.", "NTA anyone who thinks they should come before children don\u2019t need to be around them or with anyone that has them. Cut your loss and be thankful it happened now.", "ESH Be ready to be single until the kids can drive/take care of themselves nobody is going to put up being second place to an ex", "NTA. You are putting your children first, which you should and she should understand.", "Nta. Like you had to get your kids its not a debate. And your current girlfriend should know that if your relationship with  your ex is amicable then that leaves room for her relationship with you to be better if ex issues aren't looming over.", "NTA    Let\u2019s get you that vote! \nApplause all around for your solid parenting!", "How it starts:  \"don't pick your kids up at school\" \n\nHow it ends:  \"now that we are married, I found a great boarding school in another country for your children.\"\n\nNTA (unless you stay with this woman who resents your kids)", "NTA. She is very inconsiderate of your son's and their mother. If the relationship isn't over now then end it, she's horrible.", "Your children come first and better to learn what your GF is about now. She wouldn\u2019t be good for your children. Your awesome for stepping up.", "NTA. This is coming at you from someone who has bonus children. Whenever my husbands ex needs us to take the kids, we do. The oldest is now out of the house and youngest is a teen. But we still drop everything when needed. That\u2019s what you do when you have a good co-parenting relationship. There is zero point in doing what your gf suggests. The only ones that get hurt in that situation are your kids. Sounds like you need to ditch her and find someone that understands what co-parenting is and who is going to love your kids. It\u2019s not a competition between your kids and her. If she thinks it is, she will lose every time!", "NTA - You are a DAD.", "NTA. They're your kids. If you and Katie were still married and things were good, her mother or you would be picking up those kids. Harri needs to understand that the kids don't get the short end of the stick because mom and dad divorced and are now with other partners - the kids don't deserve shitty parenting on top of going through divorce that they didn't ask for. My two cents.", "NTA \n\nthose are your kids lol. you are a parent therefore you do parenting things. man, you might want to step back from this because im not sure she cares about your kids.", "NTA - Harri is the AH.  My daughter and her ex have the same flexible attitude and it works out well.  Harri needs to understand you are not helping out your ex, you are taking care of your sons. It\u2019s that simple.", "NTA. Your style of coparenting is what I wish I had with my son\u2019s father. In the end it\u2019s what\u2019s best for the kids and you\u2019re very clearly doing what\u2019s best for them", "If you don\u2019t put your kids first, every time, they will know it. You did the right thing. NTA.\n\nFWIW, I know it\u2019s probably really hard on your girlfriend to live with your competing responsibilities to your children and to her. But she\u2019s letting her ego get in the way of what\u2019s best for the children \u2014 and that always has to be the focus.", "Break up with Harri.", "I have a girlfriend with two sons, I know they're her priority and absolutely respect that 100%. Just as she respects that my mom who I am a caregiver for as she has dementia is my priority. It'd called being adults in a relationship. You're NTA but this will continue.", "NTA", "NtA good riddance with bad rubbish.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn\u2019t put your ex above Harri. You put your children above her. \n\nSeriously re-consider this relationship. This adult woman just told you that she should be a higher priority than your children. This is not a woman you want to ever play the role of a \u201cparent\u201d to your boys. \n\n(And good on you for having healthy co-parenting and being so willing to step up! The world needs more parents like this)\n\n(Edit: typo)", "NTA but Harri is. Please break up with her now before she damages your relationships with your kids!!", "NTA and you dodged a bullet.  Hopefully she moves out.", "NTA. if you can't handle what it's like to date parents, don't date parents. she should be seeing your commitment to your family as a good thing, but instead she sees it as a threat to her position in your life. I'm amazed that after 2 years she is still acting like this, but it gives you a couple hints into what your future would be like with her...", "NTA. And it's telling that her friends and mom are berating you for it. She sounds very self centered.", "A man with who prioritizes his children! I\u2019m sorry, but she\u2019s the sort who is going to demand being the highest priority. If you have children with her, she will go out of her way to make your first children feel lesser. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she hasn\u2019t been making digs at the kids and your ex. Might suggest you have an honest convo w your ex and the kids. They might be afraid of sharing, especially your ex, out of concern of being accused of lying.", "NTA. Kids always come first and if she doesn\u2019t like that she shouldn\u2019t be involved with someone who has kids. Also you might want to rethink some things since she clearly doesn\u2019t understand that they are always going to be the top priority. I know Reddit is always quick to say break up but it\u2019s a big marinara flag when she\u2019s mad that you have to be a parent", "Children over GF. NTA", "OP, you are definitely NTA! You are being a damn good father!!\n\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\n\nHarri is showing you her true colors and you should be hoping that she never comes back around!", "NTA, her first statement should have been\u2026\u201dlet\u2019s figure out if we should abandon the cart (sorry grocery store employees) or is it possible I can wrap up the groceries while you\u2019re picking up the kids?\u201d", "NTA. If SO\u2019s or potential SO\u2019s have a problem with children from a previous relationship to the point they  feel threatened, jealous, or any other green emotion, out to the dumpster they go. \n\n\n You need to have a conversation with her if that hasn\u2019t been done already. Good luck navigating through it all", "I would message the mother and the friends back and ask them why are they putting their friend and daughter above me and calling me an ahole. You are doing the same thing you're accusing op of doing. Which is really funny. So you're protecting your daughter but he's not allowed to protect and put his son's first.\n\nNta and good luck with the new girlfriend because this one should be an ex", "Why are there so many people who get their family involved in fights. I find that so freaking strange", "Correction: second line of defense is the other parent, not grandma. Your ex and her mother are being considerate of you by usually calling her mom instead. NTA.", "NTA\n\nI don't understand why anyone would date someone with kids if they can't handle their partner also being a parent.\n\nMy ex and father of my oldest was basically a walking red flag as a boyfriend, very toxic, I left that relationship with PTSD.   It took a few years, but we were able to work past it, and become friends.  Good enough friends that when he started to become interested in his current girlfriend, he made me meet her and wanted my approval before introducing her to our daughter.  His current girlfriend has become one of my best friends over the years, we all hang out together with the kids, and just as adults, and they both have been there and supportive of me and actually BOTH my children, especially since my husband and father is my youngest passed away.   I haven't moved on from that and started dating yet, but I do know anyone that had a problem with our dynamic would have to go.\n\nI think it's great that you g have a good relationship with your ex, and would actually be something I valued in a relationship should I ever decide to date again, and that person had children.", "SO TOTALLY NTA. Kudos to you and your ex for being great parents even if you couldn\u2019t be great partners. You both sound great. There are women out there who will value your love for your children and pitch in to keep them a priority. You\u2019ll likely find showing such a woman love and devotion a lot easier than - what was her name? Barri? Hurry? Can\u2019t recall. Hope you can forget her too. Congrats on being a great dad.", "NTA and not a good sign for your long term relationship. A lot of couples on good terms have in their custody agreements first rights of refusal if one or the other suddenly isn\u2019t available during their time so that the other parent can have more time with the children and the kids are with a parent and not someone else.\n\nI\u2019m not sure your ex should be prioritized above your current partner, but certainly kids should come first!", "NTA. It\u2019s hard to scorekeep and parent well at the same time, and I don\u2019t understand how 2 years in, this is just now a problem for Harri.", "NTA. Also props for being a good dad.", "NTA. 2 years in and she\u2019s just now acting this way?", "NTA\n\nFantastic that you stood up for your kids and made them important. \n\nWhat Harri didn't understand is it was you putting the ex before her, it was you putting your kids before her. Your KIDS needed picked up not your ex. \n\nYou need to take this as the sign it is and pack her shit and set it outside. If she is acting like this now, imagine how it is going to be if you got married. She will definitely try everything to come between you and your kids, and cause all kinds of drama.", "Yep. I'd continue with not seeing her and let her fade away. Someone who gets upset because you're picking your children up in stressful circumstances doesn't get a second chance. \n\nShe's shown you who she is. Believe her.", "I completely agree. I see posts on here a lot where I feel like the OP is enabling an unhealthy coparenting relationship by not setting boundaries with ex or is using \u2018kids come first\u2019 as an excuse to be a bad partner, but this is so clear cut NTA. Op\u2019s now ex baffles me.", "In all honesty I don\u2019t see how it matters. If OP\u2019s ex passed away, he\u2019d have them full time and Harri would have to deal with things like this anyways. Even when you don\u2019t have your kid(s) physically with you, you\u2019re still their parent.", "You are blessed with an amazing family. Oh how I wish my ex and I could do this for our kids", "yup better to be cordial because as long as the kids are around they\u2019re going to have to see each other", "Actually he said he would put helping his ex above her, which he should since he\u2018a helping with her with his children.", "It is a valid question.  If ex is using the kids to manipulate the situation, it would explain things.  Ex knows you are going to dinner for new GF's birthday, there is an emergency needing OP to leave everything to come to ex's house.    Ex knows you bought tickets to her favorite band, kids have an emergency.   It doesn't sound like it is happening here, but I had the same question.", "If OP felt like he was being taken advantage of, he would have said so. He\u2019s a good dad with an unfortunate choice of partner. She\u2019s finally letting the mask drop and good riddance people like Harri shouldn\u2019t be dating anyone with children."]}
