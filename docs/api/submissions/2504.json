OP and his girlfriend were grocery shopping and children's needs would always trump grocery shopping.\n\nI am not even understanding why flexibility would be a concern because that works both ways and there is nothing to indicate that OP is being taken advantage of by his ex - only that both of them are flexible in terms of schedules which benefits the children. \n\nI suspect that OP needs to rethink his relationship with current girlfriend because I can't imagine anyone who would not understand that a good parent is always going to prioritize the needs of their children over anyone else including THEIR OWN NEEDS.", "NTA - Your kids should always be your priority.

There\u2019s gotta be a longer list of emergency backups here.  And while maybe this incident isn\u2019t the particular hill Harri should be making her stand on, you can\u2019t just set a blanket policy that you will always drop everything *any* time your ex wants you to cover for them and expect a partner to be willing to live with never knowing if and when *their* plans will be interrupted regardless of whether it\u2019s actually an emergency or not.", "NAH.  You both have different priorities.

She is less important than your ex? Why is she even with you then? \n\nHowever, you did the right thing, so she was also an asshole, both of you were.\n\nMaybe you could rethink the wording that you use with Harri to describe the importance of your sons and ex. For example, you could say my sons are a top priority in my life, it's not that they are necessarily that they are more important, but perhaps you could get the same meaning across by saying they are very important to you, and as a responsible parent, you need to go do this task. \n\nOn the other hand, if your kids are not important to Harri, and one of them is as young as 3... I mean, it kinda seems like she should care about their well-being too if she is with you, and one of the things she should like about you is that you care about your kids.", "NTA", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
