While you could have explained it better by being clear from the beginning and making a firm but gentle no, you have good reason to decline. You know it. What you are feeling is not that you were an AH. You are feeling the tension of having a conflict with someone you care about. It's the same tension that had you pussyfooting around your discomfort when discussing. People will often use our aversion to such tension to convince us to do things we find inappropriate. You and hubby have good reasons. The only possible compromise I see on this is you going, maybe with a friend, while hubby stays home. But you may find it unacceptable to see the nude bodies as well, and that is your right.", "NAH - you and your husband are allowed to feel like naked sister even as art is a boundary for you.

You're just not comfortable doing so - which is totally fine. But how you've worded it _does_ imply you think her job is inappropriate.", "NAH.\n\nYour sister is not an AH for wanting to pursue a hobby, and inviting you to join in.\n\nYou are not an AH for feeling uncomfortable about watching a nude performance, and neither is your husband.\n\nEveryone saying \"YTA\" is implying that you're declining the invite out of malice, which isn't the case. Or perhaps because of a fear of nudity. But just because nudity is natural, doesn't mean you have to enjoy it. Consent is a thing.\n\nEveryone saying \"NTA\" is implying that your sister is an AH by definition. She's inviting you to a private, ticketed performance. She's not turning up to your family BBQ naked.", "I remember reading a story that Sydney Sweeney\u2019s whole family was at the premier of that HBO show where she gets naked and has sex. I couldn\u2019t imagine seeing my sister in that type of situation. \n\nNTA.", "Imma go NTA But I understand some logic behind why some redditors say YTA, and it's mostly around how you worded it.\n\nBut yeah I wouldn't want to go see my SIL nude on stage.", "I feel like you just worded that wrong, so very soft YTA. Instead of saying it's inappropriate, you could have just said it was uncomfortable for you and your husband to see her naked. To me, that gives it a less judgmental vibe and way more understandable.", "NAH. The wording \u201cinappropriate\u201d is too judgmental though, just tell her you\u2019re not comfortable.", "I mean, I can see why a big part of the answers are yta, but personally my vote is nta while you could have worded yourself better which is where the a**holery can come in for most people you and your husband clearly have a boundary with what you two find comfortable and not is reasonable and quiet frankly I'd feel embarrassed going to the show if I knew a family member would be nude for the majority of the play some people just don't want to see close family members nude in a public like setting.", "NAH.\n\n\nHer theater might be unorthodox and edgy, but it doesn't make her a whore.\n\n\nYou two aren't comfortable. That is also OK.", "NAH here... It looks like a communication issue to me.   \nMaybe saying \"we dont feel comfortable seeing you naked\" would have been softer than saying \"it is inappropriate for us to attend\".

Would you be comfortable with that? \n\nSounds like she\u2019s looking for your support and acceptance. I highly doubt she cares as much about your husband attending compared to you attending", "You hurt her feelings. Thoughtfully rechoose your words, apologize and explain. Vow to support all her endeavors and participate as you see fit. Just remember the love.", "It's understandable that you don't want to go but it's not inappropriate in any way. Soft yta for your wording, you lowkey make it sound like your sister does something dirty.", "NTA, she might be fine with being naked on stage but she shouldn't just expect you or your husband to want to see it.", "NTA. I personally think an upfront explanation as to why you weren't wanting to attend would have been more productive so as to quell the continued anticipation of your possible attendance, I understand your hesitation. I don't doubt that you support your sister and her endeavors, but you can offer support and still maintain a healthy boundary, which I believe this is. While I maintain the human form is beautiful, and nudity is normal, I think anyone would be uncomfortable in this situation.", "NTA. It\u2019s very hard to separate art from artist in this situation. In an ideal world it would all be easy to handle and everyone would be in the same sphere of comfort level. But in reality jumping from a typical job and life to people performing nude is jarring, especially a family member, whether that\u2019s philosophically or ethically ideal or not. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t think this implies you don\u2019t value her work or respect her as a performer.", "soft YTA but I think you could easily avoid this by just asking her if she's going to be nude in the show or not.

Send some flowers on opening night.", "YTA for not properly explaining your feelings.\n\n\nPro-tip: whenever you have anything negative to say, always talk about your experience and how it makes you feel.\nSaying \"it's inappropriate\" is a general judgement that indeed makes it seem like you disapprove. Saying \"it makes me feel uncomfortable\" is only about your personal feelings, there's no debate or disagreement possible when it comes to feelings and makes it clear that it's about you personally.", "NTA. If she keeps bothering you try to say something like this \u201cI\u2019m happy that your work is making you happy. I have no problem with what you are doing. This nothing to do with you or your work we just feel uncomfortable seeing you naked.\u201d", "NAH, but you worded your response really poorly.

And then perhaps send her some flowers for opening night, to show that you support her even if you can't be there in person.", "NTA once you clarified I guess but I'm surprised that intentional nudity in a play is such a thing for so many people.", "YTA. It is art, the word **inapropriate** is inappropriate. Also, why don't you go without your husband ? \n\nTbh, you really seem to not validate her work and your wording seems off.", "Nope. Who wants to see their sister naked? Yuck!", "NTA. I also would not want to watch my sister perform nude.", "She's upset you were implying what she's doing is slightly inappropriate and instead of confirming that it is indeed *slightly inappropriate* you tried to back track. This is coming from someone who has done inappropriate things for their career before, I'm aware that a strip club isn't for everyone, and I wouldn't be offended if someone told me their just not comfortable with seeing me like that, especially if they mentioned it wasn't necessarily them, but their spouse seeing me like that - totally understandable. I think you should have stood your ground, like \"I absolutely support what you're doing and I'm so proud of you, maybe I can come see one of your shows but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with my husband being present\" \nIdk, I'm not saying anyone is an asshole just that it could have been handled differently", "NTA. I also would not want to watch my sister perform nude.", "It's not inappropriate.  You're uncommon.  Those are different thongs. YTA for not taking responsibility for your feelings.", "Agree with some of the other comments because of the way you phrased it, but on the other hand, you do have a right to say no to something that you don\u2019t want to do or that makes you uncomfortable. Setting boundaries does not make you an asshole. \n\nWould you be open to going by yourself to see what it\u2019s like without your husband to see if it\u2019s something the two of you could do?

She should respect them.  If she doesn't, she is being selfish.  You can respect her career without attending her performances.", "YTA. First time actually contributing. First question I have is has your husband actually expressed discomfort or are you just assuming? Also because this is a relative what's the issue in seeing tasteful nudity? I'm not a nudist or anything but it seems like you are the one who has a boundary break here. That's just a human body and you are the one that made that sexualized. In this instance that's on you in my opinion. Maybe I'm in the minority but it's not like she is asking you to coach a porn shoot. With my minimal context it sounds like a tasteful play and you are a prude", "It\u2019s not inappropriate, you\u2019re uncomfortable with it.

Contrary to some of the other commentators and as a people pleaser, I don\u2019t think starting off with a white lie was the wrong thing to do. We\u2019ve all done it before.

Like youre clearly uncomfortable with it which is why you dont even go alone so why put all the blame and your husband like he is going to cheat the minute he sees ur sister naked (again yikes).\nAnyway im gonna wash my brain in bleach now thank you", "Gentle YTA. Everyone has a body, and hang ups about nudity are ridiculous. Would it really make your husband uncomfortable, or are you worried that she\u2019s more attractive than you?

Do you find the concept of the play itself, with nudity, inappropriate and would not go at all? In which case, YNTA. \n\nBut, do you find the concept of the play fine but wouldn\u2019t go just because your SO\u2019s sister is in it? Then yep, YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re all adults and your SO\u2019s sister has a body like most other women. She has a right to engage in activities that make her happy and as a family you should support that.

Her body is her instrument of work, and she went through experiences that made her not to think of nudity as a big deal (I mean, obviously, she performs nude in front of an audience many times a week). But I did not had the same life experiences to get to a place where I'd be as comfortable with it as she is.\n\nI also want to point out that I never had a problem with seeing nudity in a performance when the performers are complete strangers to me.

It\u2019s still just nudity, meaning there\u2019s no greater reason for someone to be uptight about it. But whether this makes your parents uncomfortable or not, it would still be considered inappropriate, because it's a clear breach of social norms in countries and cultures where nudity isn\u2019t free of taboos. It\u2019s considered inappropriate for BILs to see their SILs naked in most social situations; the fact that this nudity takes place in a play doesn\u2019t change the overall outcome.\n\nI\u2019d consider inappropriate to be naked with a boss from the opposite sex, but in Finland it\u2019s quite normal for coworkers to hit the sauna at the end of the day and comfortably share nudity.
