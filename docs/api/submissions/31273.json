While you could have explained it better by being clear from the beginning and making a firm but gentle no, you have good reason to decline. You know it. What you are feeling is not that you were an AH. You are feeling the tension of having a conflict with someone you care about. It's the same tension that had you pussyfooting around your discomfort when discussing. People will often use our aversion to such tension to convince us to do things we find inappropriate. You and hubby have good reasons. The only possible compromise I see on this is you going, maybe with a friend, while hubby stays home. But you may find it unacceptable to see the nude bodies as well, and that is your right.", "NAH - you and your husband are allowed to feel like naked sister even as art is a boundary for you.

You're just not comfortable doing so - which is totally fine. But how you've worded it _does_ imply you think her job is inappropriate.", "NAH.\n\nYour sister is not an AH for wanting to pursue a hobby, and inviting you to join in.\n\nYou are not an AH for feeling uncomfortable about watching a nude performance, and neither is your husband.\n\nEveryone saying \"YTA\" is implying that you're declining the invite out of malice, which isn't the case. Or perhaps because of a fear of nudity. But just because nudity is natural, doesn't mean you have to enjoy it. Consent is a thing.\n\nEveryone saying \"NTA\" is implying that your sister is an AH by definition. She's inviting you to a private, ticketed performance. She's not turning up to your family BBQ naked.", "I remember reading a story that Sydney Sweeney\u2019s whole family was at the premier of that HBO show where she gets naked and has sex.

Instead of saying it's inappropriate, you could have just said it was uncomfortable for you and your husband to see her naked. To me, that gives it a less judgmental vibe and way more understandable.", "NAH.

It looks like a communication issue to me.   \nMaybe saying \"we dont feel comfortable seeing you naked\" would have been softer than saying \"it is inappropriate for us to attend\".

Would you be comfortable with that? \n\nSounds like she\u2019s looking for your support and acceptance. I highly doubt she cares as much about your husband attending compared to you attending", "You hurt her feelings. Thoughtfully rechoose your words, apologize and explain.

Soft yta for your wording, you lowkey make it sound like your sister does something dirty.", "NTA, she might be fine with being naked on stage but she shouldn't just expect you or your husband to want to see it.", "NTA. I personally think an upfront explanation as to why you weren't wanting to attend would have been more productive so as to quell the continued anticipation of your possible attendance, I understand your hesitation. I don't doubt that you support your sister and her endeavors, but you can offer support and still maintain a healthy boundary, which I believe this is. While I maintain the human form is beautiful, and nudity is normal, I think anyone would be uncomfortable in this situation.", "NTA. It\u2019s very hard to separate art from artist in this situation. In an ideal world it would all be easy to handle and everyone would be in the same sphere of comfort level. But in reality jumping from a typical job and life to people performing nude is jarring, especially a family member, whether that\u2019s philosophically or ethically ideal or not. \n\nAnd I don\u2019t think this implies you don\u2019t value her work or respect her as a performer.", "soft YTA but I think you could easily avoid this by just asking her if she's going to be nude in the show or not.

Send some flowers on opening night.", "YTA for not properly explaining your feelings.\n\n\nPro-tip: whenever you have anything negative to say, always talk about your experience and how it makes you feel.\nSaying \"it's inappropriate\" is a general judgement that indeed makes it seem like you disapprove. Saying \"it makes me feel uncomfortable\" is only about your personal feelings, there's no debate or disagreement possible when it comes to feelings and makes it clear that it's about you personally.", "NTA. If she keeps bothering you try to say something like this \u201cI\u2019m happy that your work is making you happy. I have no problem with what you are doing. This nothing to do with you or your work we just feel uncomfortable seeing you naked.\u201d", "NAH, but you worded your response really poorly.

And then perhaps send her some flowers for opening night, to show that you support her even if you can't be there in person.", "NTA once you clarified I guess but I'm surprised that intentional nudity in a play is such a thing for so many people.", "YTA. It is art, the word **inapropriate** is inappropriate. Also, why don't you go without your husband ? \n\nTbh, you really seem to not validate her work and your wording seems off.", "Nope. Who wants to see their sister naked? Yuck!", "NTA. I also would not want to watch my sister perform nude.", "She's upset you were implying what she's doing is slightly inappropriate and instead of confirming that it is indeed *slightly inappropriate* you tried to back track. This is coming from someone who has done inappropriate things for their career before, I'm aware that a strip club isn't for everyone, and I wouldn't be offended if someone told me their just not comfortable with seeing me like that, especially if they mentioned it wasn't necessarily them, but their spouse seeing me like that - totally understandable. I think you should have stood your ground, like \"I absolutely support what you're doing and I'm so proud of you, maybe I can come see one of your shows but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with my husband being present\" \nIdk, I'm not saying anyone is an asshole just that it could have been handled differently", "NTA. I also would not want to watch my sister perform nude.", "It's not inappropriate.  You're uncommon.  Those are different thongs. YTA for not taking responsibility for your feelings.", "Agree with some of the other comments because of the way you phrased it, but on the other hand, you do have a right to say no to something that you don\u2019t want to do or that makes you uncomfortable. Setting boundaries does not make you an asshole. \n\nWould you be open to going by yourself to see what it\u2019s like without your husband to see if it\u2019s something the two of you could do?

She should respect them.  If she doesn't, she is being selfish.  You can respect her career without attending her performances.", "YTA. First time actually contributing. First question I have is has your husband actually expressed discomfort or are you just assuming? Also because this is a relative what's the issue in seeing tasteful nudity? I'm not a nudist or anything but it seems like you are the one who has a boundary break here. That's just a human body and you are the one that made that sexualized. In this instance that's on you in my opinion. Maybe I'm in the minority but it's not like she is asking you to coach a porn shoot. With my minimal context it sounds like a tasteful play and you are a prude", "It\u2019s not inappropriate, you\u2019re uncomfortable with it.

Contrary to some of the other commentators and as a people pleaser, I don\u2019t think starting off with a white lie was the wrong thing to do. We\u2019ve all done it before.

Like youre clearly uncomfortable with it which is why you dont even go alone so why put all the blame and your husband like he is going to cheat the minute he sees ur sister naked (again yikes).\nAnyway im gonna wash my brain in bleach now thank you", "Gentle YTA. Everyone has a body, and hang ups about nudity are ridiculous. Would it really make your husband uncomfortable, or are you worried that she\u2019s more attractive than you?

Then yep, YTA. \n\nYou\u2019re all adults and your SO\u2019s sister has a body like most other women. She has a right to engage in activities that make her happy and as a family you should support that.

I can just look away during that scene or go have a smoke.", "Yep, agree to disagree. This is plain paradoxical logic. Cheers.", "I wouldn't say that you're an asshole for telling her that you're uncomfortable with the type of work she's doing, however saying that you feel it's inappropriate does imply that you don't approve of it. What you could say to her is that while you do support her and wish her all the best that the types of plays that she is a part of make you uncomfortable. Just be honest not everybody is comfortable with nudity especially when you're talking about somebody's husband seeing their sister-in-law full profile. There's nothing wrong with it, I mean both her work and your feelings about attendance. Just let her know that you support her even if you don't feel comfortable enough to attend. Some people are just wired that way.", "NTA.  You can\u2019t un-see naked sister in law so no is the right answer to tickets to see her naked.", "NTA but could you go see a show without your husband? Just to show your support. As long as you\u2019re not uncomfortable with it. Sometimes it\u2019s good to get out of our comfort zones but I understand this may be a bit taboo since it\u2019s family.", "NTA! It's valid to not want to see her naked. Do Not feel like an AH! You can be proud of her without seeing her naked. I wouldn't want to see either of my SIL naked.", "\"love you sis, but I have no interest in seeing you naked.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA but I think you should probably make it clear you are proud she's doing what she loves\n\nLike \"hey sis I'm proud of ya, and glad you are doing what you love, but seeing you naked kind of words me out, ide be happy to pass the tickets along to others though if you like\"\n\nStuff like that", "NTA. Although maybe you could have worded it as a we\u2019re uncomfortable rather than it\u2019s inappropriate?", "NTA. Why the hell would anyone want their husband to see their sister running around naked. It is VERY inappropriate and would make you guys VERY uncomfortable. You\u2019re definitely NTA.", "I don't think anyone is an asshole here. You and your husband might come off as a bit prudish to someone more comfortable with nudity. But there's nothing wrong with that either.", "Nta, inappropriate for you is just that. And it fits.", "Nope. With all due respect, these plays are not my cup of tea and make me uncomfortable.", "YTA because you worded what COULD have been a reasonable boundary and aversion/preference (\"I don't want to see you naked, I don't want my husband to see you naked, I generally don't care for Art that involves seeing other people naked and the fact that it's you, who is Family, makes me especially uncomfortable.\") as an absolute judgement on the appropriateness of her work.", "YTA, you lied, then told her her show was inappropriate... not a cool move.  You should have just been honest from the get-go and said you were uncomfortable because of the nudity.  Nothing wrong with skipping something because it makes you uncomfortable. There is something wrong with lying to a loved one, then saying something they've worked very hard at is inappropriate.", "YTA\n\nYou lied about the reason, tell her the truth", "YTA. And not a soft one. Inappropiate implies judgement, you are plainly saying she is doing something wrong. \n\nIt may make you feel uncomfortable, you know what relationship you have with your sister but I would definitely endure some discomfort to support mine on her dreams/careers. So in my opinion YTA in any case. \n\nYou sound very entitled that your position is the \"right\" one. Well, someone may think that you are sexualizing nudity and you are the one who may have inappropiate thoughts in the face of nudity. And that is definitely a you problem. So, just food for thought, some of us think that you and your husband are a bit pervy, frankly. An alternative viewpoint.", "From your statement it sounds like you do believe her work is inappropriate, and that\u2019s OK. It sounds like you wouldn\u2019t go to any play where there were inappropriate things happening. You\u2019re not the asshole for not wanting to see your sister get naked on stage, it\u2019s very doable not to want to see your family or anyone else to be naked on the stage. you have autonomy over your body you have every right to choose how you do or don\u2019t spend your time", "Insisting family/in-laws see you naked is weird. Imagine being a stripper and insisting your family show up to support you.  I know it's theatre so it's different. The feelings are likely similar though.  You can't force other people to be comfortable with you performing nude.  Imagine if this were a dude... people would probably be reacting very differently. NTA.", "YTA, you and your nasty husband can't stop sexualizing her body enough to enjoy a play and that is really childish and gross. grow up.", "YTA for lying. You clearly do feel it is inappropriate! That\u2019s fine, just, you know, tell the truth.", "YTA and dudes have to pretend to be uncomfortable so as not to get an ass chewing", "NTA.  If she wants to be edgy, not everybody is going to be on board.\n\nAsk if there's a way you can be supportive without seeing her naked.", "Nah but u could have told her the real reason why", "NTA. I went to theatre school and I know that my family is a pretty conservative so I would warn them if shows had things in it I knew they\u2019d be uncomfortable with. I literally told them I would rather them not come to a particular show if the content would offend them and make them upset because I know not every show is for every person. I also 100% would not have wanted them at a show I was naked in lol. \n\nFor the sake of keeping the peace, maybe reach out to her and explain that you didn\u2019t mean her show or work was inappropriate, just that you and your husband are uncomfortable with nudity on stage as a whole.", "NAH , because ultimately it\u2019s your choice \n\nBut ask yourself , why as a grown adult , you are uncomfortable by the human body in a setting that is clearly non sexual", "NTA in my opinion. Family and support is one thing but, I'll be damned if see my family members naked and be ok with it. I dunno, it's just sounds weird to me. I'd just tell them I'm not going and if they keep asking, I'll tell them to f off about the subject.", "My only thought is, if it makes OP uncomfortable for her husband to see her sister nude, there isn't really a logical route for her to take to allow herself to go. Is it because she's family? If so, OP shouldn't go. Is it opposite sex nudity? If so, OP shouldn't go. Like, if I'm OP's husband and I hear something like \"I'm not comfy with you going to the nudie show, BUT I'm going to check it out with a friend. BTW do you have any singles?\" I'm going to give a little side eye.", "that\u2019s because OP likely does, i guarantee they\u2019ve had conversations with her husband talking about how inappropriate and odd it is for her sister to be seen naked in a play.\n\nunfortunately OP likely worded it that way because that\u2019s how she feels, sure she could\u2019ve worded better but that would have essentially been lying to preserve the relationship, no?", "I don't think people saying YTA are implying she declined out of malice or a fear of nudity. They're saying the way she declined was rude because it implied the sister was in the wrong here.", "Wait those step sis pornhub videos are lying?", "If that very slight miswording makes her an AH, then the sister not taking a hint/no for an answer is also an AH", "Isn't it interesting how people will avoid communicating directly in order to avoid awkwardness or confrontation, but often will create even more conflict by doing that.", "Maybe he wanted to tell them something without telling them something. Like being in theater didn't imply things anyway.", ">If you are uncomfortable seeing her perform nude,\n\nThen OP just needs to say that.  The sister's performance isn't \"inappropriate\" and it wouldn't be \"inappropriate\" for OP and her husband to attend if they were comfortable with it.  It's OK for OP to not be comfortable and she should just say that rather than putting judgement saying it would be \"inappropriate\" to see her sister perform.  That conversation about being uncomfortable is a respectful way for OP to own her own feelings without disparaging her sister's performance.

But I think you're taking it pretty personally, considering it's not about you.\n\nAnd I'm not sure *how* I'm ableist, but ok.", "I\u2019m sorry but yes I would feel it is inappropriate for my sister to request my spouse to watch her performing in the nude. If she wants to perform in the nude, more power to her. But neither my spouse nor myself are going to watch it and we would feel it is inappropriate to ask.\n\nThere are some families who are not as private and more free with body. There is nothing wrong with that. I believe Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell raised their kids in a very pro-nudity household. So I wouldn\u2019t think anything of it if Kate said she gave Oliver, Goldie or Kurt tickets to a show where she was nude. But if your family isn\u2019t that open with their bodies, it can be seen as an inappropriate request.", "Whether it's inappropriate is still a personal opinion though. It really sounds like the OP structured her response by blaming her sister's actions rather than her own feelings.", "idk, in my country it is perfectly normal. Nudity isnt a big deal where im from.

Parents, children, siblings can't see each other naked??", "\"Should not\" is so prudish mate. Yes its a normal reaction to not want to but its also normal for other families to see each other naked.", "It's not even her though it's the hubby, she isn't comfortable with him seeing her sister but it sounds like any other man or woman would be acceptable as she put a lot of emphasis on Sister/SIL, which makes you question their marriage and if they know how to act like adults.", "I can\u2019t even count how many times this has happened to me when I was younger.  Now, After the first NO I\u2019ll beat them over the head with the 2nd.

Granted , may have been more uncomfortable of our family was one of the performers.", ">  There's nothing inappropriate about watching a play\n\nbut you can feel that watching your sister or sister in law naked on stage is inappropriate. Most families wear bathing suits when going into a pool even if there is no one else around because it is \"appropriate\" those are standards a lot of people grow up with. Just like a lot of people dont think its appropriate to wear a denim jacket and jeans at the same time. Nothing inherently wrong with it just not what they feel comfortable with.", "Yes there is. It would be inappropriate for me to see my sister masterbate on stage for her edgy BS play. It is even more inappropriate for her to ask me to watch her do so. There are things that are inappropriate to watch.\n\nContext absolutely matters", "Europe has a huge range of cultures. You talking about being \u2018European\u2019 as if we all have one view on this is ironically SO American lmao, it actually makes me doubt you\u2019re even European... it\u2019s extremely American to refer to Europeans as a group, most of us refer to ourselves by nationality.", "But with this experimental and edgy play, you really think there isn\u2019t a sexual component? Bottom line, unless you are raised in a family/environment where the human body is just a body, it is an inappropriate request. Seeing how this woman says she is uncomfortable, it would seem her and her sister were not raised by the standard that a body is just a body.", "Why would it be inappropriate to ask? Everyone is an adult and the nudity is part of an art piece.\n\nSaying no the offer is totally valid, but I don't see how it's inappropriate to ask.", "because its not about wanting them to see you naked...its about them being there and supporting your art.

I can also be annoyed every time a stuckup European supremacist brings a conversation to a grinding halt and acts like their way of thinking is the one right way, regardless of how anyone else feels.

And unfortunately being dense about the situation doesn't make them an asshole (oblivious is bliss I suppose).\n\nGenerally speaking no one wants to see their family nude or their significant others to see their family nude. The first time she gets a pass but when she keeps pushing at it, there's a point where she has to get it.\n\nShe can't even see its an issue. That's the bigger issue here. Not even an acknowledgment of what she is asking. Immediately it goes to all about her and how she feels that her work is inappropriate. The immediate victim mentality she springs up for a perfectly reasonable response does make me want to give her an asshole score.\n\n**Only an asshole would push for someone to do something that makes them feel uncomfortable despite them protesting against wanting to do it.**", "Of course, of course.", "Oh, and I am on an accessibility committee.
