{"id": 28723, "submission_id": "175oxoe", "title": "AITA for telling people the truth about why my ex-boyfriend broke up with me?", "selftext": "I(22f) used to date my ex-boyfriend Mike(22f). For context, we met when we were 13 at a church camp. He had a crush on me and I knew about it bc he told people he hoped we would date. They started asking me if I also had a crush on him, which I didn't, so I asked him to stop telling people that, and we were only friends. He said ok. I switched schools and ended up going to the same school he went. He was a very religious kid, which often came up in convos bc he would start talking about his \"godly future wife\". I found it odd, since we were only 13yo, but he was a church kid so it wasn't that uncommon. I found out people thought we were dating because one of his friends told me I wasn't invited to his bday party since I was \"Mike's girl\". I was confused, because I was very clear with Mike about being just friends and not liking him in any other way, so I went to talk to him and asked him to stop telling people that. He denied telling people, but eventually accepted. \n\nWe remained friends but he was very open about still liking me, so I kept him at a safe distance and made it very clear that we were ONLY friends. We lost contact after graduating from HS and then we ran into each other at my college campus. We started talking again and eventually started going out.\n\nAfter 2m of dating we were driving to a date and as I was telling him about something, he interrupted me and said \"Can you stop? You are tiring me out\" I looked at him in shock and asked him what he meant, to which he said \"I'm just kinda bored, tired of you\". I wanted to cry, but I held it in and asked him to drop me off on the next street, so I could take the bus home. He said I was being dramatic, and I told him I didn't want to bore him, so I would take myself home. I got off the car and walked to the bus stop while getting a panic attack, and went home. I texted him we could talk about what happened but it would take me a few days to gather myself. \n\nAfter a few months he went on a trip to the US to visit his baby nephew, and while he was there he was very distant but I didn't think anything of it, since he was in a diff country. He came back and told me we had to see each other urgently. I said yes, and when we met up, he brought me all of my clothes I had at his house. He told me he was dumping me, and when I asked him what had happened, he quickly started saying \"No, nothing happened, I didn't do anything I swear, I only babysat my nephew and played volleyball, nothing else\". I told him I meant what happened between us, and then he told me \"I fell out of love with you after I saw you having a panic attack because I told you you were boring\". I laughed, and said \"Okay, that's fine. I hope you get home safe\" and walked home. \n\nSo AITA for telling people who've asked, that he dumped me bc he fell out of love after seeing me have a panic attack? He has told multiple people it wasn't like that, and that I'm being dramatic to make him look bad, but that is literally what he told me. help?", "created_utc": 1697058373, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/175oxoe/aita_for_telling_people_the_truth_about_why_my/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But. Why the hell would you date him in the first place? And why would you stay after he called you boring and you walked to the bus stop? And why tell people about it at all? He sounds like a dick. And he probably had sex on his trip and he\u2019s embarrassed for his religious beliefs or whatever", "NTA-He wants to be the victim and the good guy here so he\u2019s lying. You\u2019re telling the truth as he told it to you.", "NTA you deserve someone who will listen to you even if they find it boring. Relationships are about supporting each other not making someone feel bad about themselves. Of course he is trying to still look good he doesn't want other women at college to know he isn't emotionality mature enough for a relationship.", "NTA. Sounds like this guy wasn't (and probably still isn't) equipped to have meaningful relationships and that he tapped out long before he actually broke up with you. Who says that? \"I'm just kinda bored, tired of you?\" That's insane, I would sob if my S/O ever said something like that to me. Keep telling people the truth, he deserves to have his \"image\" ruined.", "NTA. he is a jerk. Sorry. Wishing you find a much better guy to date. I suspect he liked the idea of you more than actually being with you. That\u2019s no slight on you. It\u2019s what he made up in his head which is often impossible for anyone to live up to.", "NTA.  My guess is he broke up with you because you weren't \"godly wife\" material.  After all, you were talking about yourself and not just focused on him.  You didn't just speak when spoken to.  Honestly, you dodged a bullet.", "You're not an asshole but I hope you learned something about relationships and dating.", "NTA\n\nFrom my perspective, you were never really into him at all.  He just...wore you down with almost a decade of essentially stalking you.  He's going to move on to his next victim now as he already got what he wanted. I'm not implying that's sex, though. Just...conquest. Victory.  \n\nYou are SO much better off. He was never your friend. He was your manipulative stalker.  You talked yourself into it after so many years of him building it up. He's a total AH and is probably actively doing this to someone else now.", "NTA but I\u2019m kinda thinking he cheated on you\u2026", "NTA. This guy put you on a pedestal then pushed you off it.", "So? He looks bad because what he said to you was bad. You're lucky, you dodged a bullet there. You're NTA.", "Nothing good comes of dishing personal drama in a specific way. \u201cWe broke up.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cIt just wasn\u2019t a good fit.\u201d That\u2019s usually adequate. Everyone wants sympathy and encouragement/reinforcement/allyship, but you have to be tactful about where you seek this. If it will cause further drama, don\u2019t do it. Unless you want the drama. NTA but there are better ways.", "Nra", "NTA.. I think you escaped a bad situation.  He needs a lot more maturing.", "NTA but you don\u2019t need to tell folks what he said and you shouldn\u2019t focus on that. All you need to know is that he decided to end the relationship.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not worth dwelling on.", "NTA, keep telling people!! You're gonna save some girls SO much trouble", "Yeah  dating rule #1.... Never EVER date your stalker.", "He was probably super charming and faked being interested in the beginning so he could tear her down later. Super common tactic that assholes like him use. It also seems like, even before they were dating, he was a massive gaslighter. It really screws with your head and makes it hard to think rationally when someone is constantly telling you that something you know happened didn't happen. I wouldn't blame her, he manipulated her. She also explicitly said that she tells people when they ask. It's not like she's just tossing that information around willy-nilly."]}
