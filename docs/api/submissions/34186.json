I currently live in an apartment owned by my dad. It\u2019s a nice apartment, 3 bedrooms, in an area convenient for work, transport, and socialising. \n\nWhen Ben and I started discussing living together, I said I didn\u2019t want to move. I love rent free, in a very desirable area, with far more space than the two of us would be able to afford if we rented ourselves. Ben agreed, and was happy to move into my place since he lives much further out from the city centre where transport isn\u2019t as good. \n\nWhen we told my dad we\u2019d like Ben to move in, my dad said that was fine, he\u2019d be happy for Ben to pay the same rent he pays now when he moves in (this is, monetarily, an incredible deal, as Ben\u2019s current rent is about 1/5th of what my apartment would be worth on the rental market). Ben was really surprised and said we\u2019d talk more about it.\n\nBasically, Ben thinks if he moves in with me he shouldn\u2019t have to pay rent because I\u2019m not. I said it\u2019s not the same because it\u2019s my dad, he wouldn\u2019t take money from me. I pointed out to Ben he would be moving to a better area, bigger place, not having to pay bills, essentially for free, but he still said he\u2019s not okay with being the only one of us paying rent, and wants to find another place.\n\nI think this is an extremely petty reason to want to find a new place. If my place was inconvenient for him work-wise, or the price was extortionate, or he wanted to buy a place, literally any logical reason I would compromise. But this just seems like he\u2019s playing a game of tit for tat. His rent would be the same, I don\u2019t see why it matters to him whether I\u2019m paying rent or not, and I don\u2019t want to move. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1704195904, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18wnkfl/aita_for_not_wanting_to_move_because_my_bf_doesnt/", "score": 501, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If he\u2019s not willing to move into a nice place for 1/5th of the cost of what it\u2019s worth just because he\u2019s jealous of you living there for free he isn\u2019t too bright and doesn\u2019t care that much about you. Let him continue living where he is.", "INFO: Will Ben be given a lease? If not, NAH. It's not his business what you pay, but I can see why Ben might not want to move into a flat where either you or your father can throw him out at any time. You've only been dating for a year, you're still completely dependent on your father, and I can see why Ben is reluctant to move into a space where he holds no cards.", "NAH - no way in hell would I be moving if I were you, but from Bens side no way would I move in with you either. You have a huge power imbalance here and what happens when you argue or break up, can you swear hand on heart you & your dad won\u2019t hold the lease over his head? It\u2019s a good deal on paper but where\u2019s the security for him? If you draw up a lease agreement how well does it protect him (and dad drawing up the agreement himself doesn\u2019t count, still a power imbalance).\n\nBen might be a freeloader or he might\u2019ve been just expecting a reduction in living costs which typically happens when you move in with a partner\u2026.. There is no winner here.", "Ben wanted to move in with you because he expected free rent. Do not move in with Ben.\n\nNTA", "I\u2019m going to say NAH because you definitely shouldn\u2019t move since you aren\u2019t paying rent, but I can understand the BF mindset.

I wouldn\u2019t want my partner\u2019s dad to by my landlord, he loses his privacy, he doesn\u2019t save any money, and he\u2019ll be the one forced out if the relationship goes south.

NAH. \n\nIf he\u2019s expecting you to give up free rent in a good sized, well-located apartment so that you can pay money to live in a smaller, less desirable place just for the \u201cbenefit\u201d of living with him, he\u2019s nuts and arrogant as hell. NTA.", "NAH I understand if Ben was probably counting on moving somewhere together so that his housing costs would reduce. That's a common reason to move in with a partner or roommate - cheaper than living alone. So if he's expected to pay the same living together as living alone, but it's less privacy, that doesn't seem fair. Understand it's a bigger place, but his intent wasn't to live there it was to find a reasonable place together. I would be disappointed too.\n\nTotally fair for you to not want to leave a rent free situation. Would your dad cover part of your rent if you moved out elsewhere? He could rent your current place at market value.\n\nIf you care about the relationship you will probably have to compromise in some way too.", "NAH There\u2019s no way in hell any rational person is going to be the only one paying for an apartment where the landlord is your partner\u2019s dad", "NAH.\n\nCan't blame you for not wanting to move out of your very sweet deal with your dad as your landlord so you pay no rent.   \n\n\nCan't blame Ben for not wanting to change his independence to a situation where he is very definitely dependent on you.", "NAH. He won't feel like an equal if he's paying rent and you're not. It's also going to feel like your apartment since you already have lived there, and since your dad owns it, it makes their relationship more complicated.

He\u2019s paying  the rent but you and your dad are the ones on charge.", "NAH \n\n\nThere is definitely a power imbalance if he moves in.\n\n\nAnd 1/5 of market is nice, but most people end up saving money by moving in with a partner. But he doesn't need a 3BR luxury apartment. And you're talking about 1/5 of the whole place, but he's 50% of the people renting it. So, at best, he's paying 2/5 of market rent. With that power imbalance. \n\n\nMakes sense that you don't want to give up your deal, but also makes sense that he doesn't want to move into a place that has basically a tenant/landlord relationship with you.", "NAH - this is a difference of opinion. I\u2019ll admit it does sound like a good idea and there does seem to be beneficial to Ben. But I also can see how someone would maybe not want to become financially entangled with their partners parent.", "NAH - from a purely logical standpoint I think your right but if I was in Bens position there\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019d move in either. Moving just to pay the same and slowly build resentment toward the freeloading partner wouldn\u2019t be good for me, just waiting for that first fight where \u201cthis isn\u2019t your house\u201d \u201cmy dad can kick you out \u201c etc etc, it\u2019s a massive power imbalance. Either just put off living together until your old enough to contribute or break up and find someone\u2019s who\u2019s okay with this arrangement.", "NSH I feel like this just won\u2019t work but nobody is an asshole", "I'm going to say NAH. This is a common issue when dating where the couple has vastly different economic levels. One side wants to maintain their lifestyle while the other can't afford that lifestyle or doesn't value parts of it as highly.\n\nOne of the big advantages of living together is that you get to share living expenses and save money. Sure, you gave an arguably nicer place to live, but he isn't saving any money and doesn't want to remain in financial stress just to meet your lifestyle.\n\nIf I were to move in with a partner, I wouldn't want us to pool our current rent and get something twice as expensive. I would expect that we get something at around a rent where we both pay about half the rent we were before. Maybe we could get a slightly larger space since there are two of us since she might need a home office like me, but we wouldn't pay double our current individual rents. Maybe 60% to 75% of what we were before.\n\nI would bet that he would have the same reaction to you two moving somewhere new where he wasn't saving any money.\n\nIt's like getting an offer to buy a Ferrari for 50% of its value, but you can only afford a Civic. Sure, it is an amazing deal, but that doesn't mean you can afford it. (Assuming you can't just flip the Ferrari in this example)\n\nI also don't think it is realistic to ask you to move out simply because your dad owns it. You are getting free rent at an amazing place. Also, your dad needs to protect his investment by having a lease, so it isn't crazy to expect him to pay.\n\nI see two potential solutions:\n\n1) See if you can work out a deal with your dad where you move out into a cheaper place that works for both of you, but your dad pays your rent. He would be able to rent out your current place and could use a portion of it to pay your rent. He might actually profit from the deal overall.\n\n2) You contribute to his portion of rent at your place. You could offer to cover something like 25% of his current rent. Or maybe you can talk with your dad to reduce it by a little, but I think having it come from you would mean a lot more.", "NAH. It\u2019s completely reasonable you don\u2019t want to move. If most people\u2019s parents owned apartment buildings, we\u2019d likely all do the same. \n\nThat said, it\u2019s completely reasonable that your boyfriend does not want to be treated as a tenant by your dad, still paying the same rent he is now. Your dad is making anything off of the apartment by letting you live there rent-free, so why does he feel the need to suddenly profit off of your boyfriend? That\u2019s not being very welcoming or treating him like family. Plus if your boyfriend is the only one actually paying for the place between the two of you, does that mean he\u2019ll get more say in decor? Will he get at least one of the rooms to call his own for a home office/gaming room/gym/whatever? Or did you assume he would just move in and not want to rearrange or add anything despite him paying rent while you are there for free? Furthermore, people typically pay less rent by moving in with their significant other. From a financial standpoint, he gains nothing whatsoever by moving in with you. Last but not least, most people don\u2019t want any kind of business arrangement with their significant other\u2019s parents. It\u2019s just uncomfortable and doesn\u2019t help foster a close, familial relationship. \n\nMost couples move in together because they\u2019re ready to move their joint life forward. From the sound of things, all that\u2019s happening here is your dad gains more income while your boyfriend loses his personal space and now has to deal with his girlfriend\u2019s dad being his landlord, and your life remains largely unchanged. Again, you\u2019re  not wrong for not wanting to move, but are you sure you\u2019re ready to live with your boyfriend at this point in time?", "You\u2019re NTA for not wanting to move, but your dad is very much an asshole for charging your bf. If he\u2019s living in the same space that you are living in, which you already are not paying for, why does your dad feel the need to charge? You\u2019re still living there ffs! He\u2019s not earning the income already, it would not be financially different whatsoever for dad if bf moves in, so he just decides fuck it I can charge this man that may be family someday? Very clearly putting a wedge between your dad and bf and just for some money he already decided he didn\u2019t need. Huge dick move", "Offer to pay for all groceries, in recognition that he\u2019ll be paying rent and you won\u2019t. \n\nOr offer to put an equivalent amount of money each month into a travel fund that the two of you can use together.", "OP - can you imagine any scenario where anyone would want to live with you while you pay rent and they don\u2019t? Would you ever put yourself in that situation? Not trying to be rude, but you will end up living alone forever if this is how you want it to go.", "Info: How much is his current rent? Is this a hcol area?", "The only way you are N T A is if you and your dad agree that if you break up, your bf gets to stay in the place and you will move. Renting an apartment means security that you can stay there.", "In honesty, I'm not truly convinced that this is just about rent.  It's possible that he thinks that if he has you over a barrel, you'll cave and he'll get to live in your nice apartment without paying anything at all, and live the life of riley.  Of course he should pay rent if he moves in, and why on earth would you move out and start paying rent when you already have a place?  But, at the same time, your dad *is* the landlord, and that could put Ben in a difficult situation, should anything happen between the two of you.  Is it just about the rent, or is it that Ben will have no say in the property as a tenant, and be little more than a guest in your home, where your dad could kick him out at any time?  Would there be a tenancy contract giving him legal rights, if he was to move in?  Would you be equals, or would you be the defacto landlord?  It's a bit of an awkward one, TBH, because I think that there might be a little more going on here than him trying to take advantage.", "NAH - Ben is giving up a place that probably has a reasonable rent if you're in a rent controlled area.  It might be 1/5 of what your place would go for on the market, but still not a good decision for him.", "Why don\u2019t you and Ben just split the rent your dad would charge him to make Ben feel better? If everything works out after the first year, maybe talk to your dad about reducing it to zero or something lower. I can definitely see both sides of this.", "Ben would be smart to stay the fuck away from you and your dad", "I\u2019m going to get downvoted for sure, but my verdict is NAH, and here\u2019s why:\n\nOP is NTA for not wanting to move. She has a sweet gig where her rent is paid.\n\nBF is also NTA for not wanting to live in a place where only he pays to live there. If this were any other circumstances, non-paying roommates don\u2019t deserve a room.\n\nAlso, let\u2019s hear it for the greedy landlord who wants to make $$$ of his daughter\u2019s BF. If they were married, would he still ask for the money?\n\nThere is no win/win here, and OP, I really hope you hear this: You will never get anyone to live with you where only they have to pay rent. It just isn\u2019t fair. It\u2019s great you have a cool thing going, honestly good for you! But the allure of living with someone who doesn\u2019t pay rent while thru have to, isn\u2019t there \n\nGood luck", "The real AH is your dad honestly. I also wouldn't want to live in my partner's UNTIL THIS MOMENT rent-free apartment if i was the only one expected to pay, and I kind of don't think I'd even continue the relationship after being made to feel A) so unwelcome by their parents and B) so unsupported by my partner.\n\nAs they say, this isn't about the Iranian yogurt. It's about being singled-out in an unwelcoming way.", "So; \n\nYour friend would pay rent but you wouldn't.\n\nThe apartment is in a better residential area, your friend would only pay 1/5 of the rent for 100% of the apartment but in the end it would be the same as what he is paying now, right?\nAnd he has the same rights as a third party tenant?\n\nDoes your father also pay the utility for you and your boyfriend would have to cover 50% himself?\n\nMaybe he thinks that because he's the only one paying rent, he's also indirectly paying for you?\nCould it be that he feels unequal and insecure? Talk about it.\n\nI would say NAH", "NTA and if I were your dad I\u2019d make him sign a lease too!", "NAH. It's a sweet deal for you but his girlfriend's father being his landlord, and feeling beholden to him? I can understand why he's uncomfortable with that. Will he be protected by a formal lease? What happens if you two split? Presumably your dad will have you stay and him kicked out the same day - an illegal eviction, especially if he decides he doesn't want to leave?\n\nThe whole situation can get very messy, mixing business with (SO's) family and it makes a lot of sense for him not to do that, not just him being \"prideful\".", "you should pay equally, even if you don\u2019t tell your dad", "When your dad told him he\u2019d have to pay rent, it went from being your apt to being your dad\u2019s apt.

I currently live in an apartment owned by my dad. It\u2019s a nice apartment, 3 bedrooms, in an area convenient for work, transport, and socialising. \n\nWhen Ben and I started discussing living together, I said I didn\u2019t want to move. I love rent free, in a very desirable area, with far more space than the two of us would be able to afford if we rented ourselves. Ben agreed, and was happy to move into my place since he lives much further out from the city centre where transport isn\u2019t as good. \n\nWhen we told my dad we\u2019d like Ben to move in, my dad said that was fine, he\u2019d be happy for Ben to pay the same rent he pays now when he moves in (this is, monetarily, an incredible deal, as Ben\u2019s current rent is about 1/5th of what my apartment would be worth on the rental market). Ben was really surprised and said we\u2019d talk more about it.\n\nBasically, Ben thinks if he moves in with me he shouldn\u2019t have to pay rent because I\u2019m not. I said it\u2019s not the same because it\u2019s my dad, he wouldn\u2019t take money from me. I pointed out to Ben he would be moving to a better area, bigger place, not having to pay bills, essentially for free, but he still said he\u2019s not okay with being the only one of us paying rent, and wants to find another place.\n\nI think this is an extremely petty reason to want to find a new place. If my place was inconvenient for him work-wise, or the price was extortionate, or he wanted to buy a place, literally any logical reason I would compromise. But this just seems like he\u2019s playing a game of tit for tat. His rent would be the same, I don\u2019t see why it matters to him whether I\u2019m paying rent or not, and I don\u2019t want to move. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don't think this is about wanting to freeload. \n\nETA, also, he would be paying less if he shared an apartment with a partner.

He's still getting a major deal, with not having to pay utilities and be in a better location and having more space, and the dad is just trying to protect his daughter. \nMy partner not having to pay rent just means we have more \"extra\" funds to save for the future faster. \nI do think an open discussion regarding finances is important to have before moving forward but you should be doing that anyway.", "That's a super nice idea!!", "This is acceptable, I think. Split the rent or make it proportionate to each partner's pay. Paying $0 to live somewhere is almost no one's reality. I'm happy for OP, and at the same time, what if someday her partner wants to try living somewhere else? \"Sorry Partner, we'll be living in this apartment forever and you'll be the only one paying for it.\" Yeah... that's hot.\n\nI know someone living in a place their family owns--they still have to pay a little rent.

Your dad can continue supporting his daughter by giving you both a great deal on rent, and then you split it fairly between the two of you (\"fair\" could be 50/50 or proportionally according to your respective incomes).

And she obviously is the one with security if they break up. \n\n\nAnd, if I have a problem with my apartment, I'll have no issue talking to the super, management, or even calling the city (311 in NYC) to report the problems. It's a very different situation when it's your girlfriend's dad.", "She's freeloading off her dad. Which is fine.\n\nIf OP pays the same rent he did before, he is losing money vs a situation where he is splitting costs 50/50 with a girlfriend who isn't freeloading off her dad.\n\nThat hypothetical apartment with the non freeloading girlfriend paying 50% would likely be crappier and smaller, but OP's boyfriend would be saving money vs living alone. With OP, he gets a nicer apartment, but is not sharing money. Plus he's put in the uncomfortable position of her dad being the landlord.\n\nOP should pay 50% of whatever her father charges the boyfriend. Otherwise she's the asshole.", "OP would be covering zero percent of the expenses. OP is not paying \"through her family\".\n\nOP's boyfriend covering 20% of the market value, and 100% of the actual rent, would still result in him losing money vs a situation where he has a girlfriend carrying her weight to split rent with in a smaller, crappier apartment. And that apartment wouldn't come with a power imbalance.\n\nOP should pay half of whatever rent her boyfriend gets charged.", "But technically, he wouldn\u2019t\u2026 if he is getting to move into an apartment for 1/5 the going rate, he is still saving more money than if he moved into an equivalent apartment with a paying partner. If he did that, he\u2019d be paying 2.5/5 of the going rate. Still quite a deal.", "Also make sure there is a lease.", "He is already eating the expense. He doesn\u2019t have to do any additional eating if the boyfriend moves in.", "This sub needs to get over the idea that someone benefiting from their parent's success is freeloading, being lazy, or not being an adult.", "Spoiled for acknowledging that everybody would gladly get rid of their housing costs if they could? LOL.", "Waiting 6 months and discuss things might be a good option for both of you at this stage. \n\nWhen you\u2019re ready to live with someone, might be best to move out and to a different place. You have a safety net to move back into should things go south, and it gives you some independence from dads money. \n\nYour bf sounds like he wasn\u2019t clear on his intention and might just be poor communication on both sides. Issue with moving him in now is that he might expect you to pay more of the shared bills to make it \u2018fair\u2019. Better off waiting and working through concerns before taking the leap.", "Yeah, as one girl whose dad pays for her living situation to another, your guy\u2019s a jealous idiot. I left my last guy because of shit like this, my current partner knows what a blessing it is in this economy.", ">than if he moved into an equivalent apartment with a paying partner\n\nYou're making the assumption he wants to move into a larger place, which OP said they haven't discussed. Frankly I think both parties need to communicate more /better", "I mean, in this dad\u2019s situation I personally would tell my kid that if they want to live with their partner, that\u2019s great but they should be splitting expenses and I\u2019d give them a shared discounted rate. (Like the 1/5 of market rate OP has stated, but saying they\u2019re each responsible for half of it). Even at no *additional* expense, I\u2019m not footing the bill for someone who isn\u2019t an actual member of my family.", "I didn't say they were freeloading. I was just pointing out they aren't the owner of the apartment.", "What does she pay for? She said\nUtilities were included in rent so she definitely gets the better bargain! If I was Ben I would just leave and stay at my current house or get a new one", "He was looking for a free ride. When he found out he wasn\u2019t getting one, he threw a tantrum and now wants to make both of their lives worse because he\u2019s pouting.", "I replied to the wrong comment, my bad.", "So you expect your boyfriend to forfeit his income to pay rent when you don't and then, what, also split the other bills 50/50? That's not fair or equitable and I'd refuse to move in with you, too.\n\nThis is why it's so hard for people in different financial levels to be in relationships. Your boyfriend is fine with spending money and working hard and building a life together, you want to live with your silver spoon in your mouth and don't care that your goose down life style would make it harder for him in the long run. Relationships are partnerships, and you're not being a good partner.", "She doesn\u2019t have to pay for anything because her dad is paying for her. I know miserable people with shitty and/or broke parents get very upset when other people have parents who are willing, able, and enjoy helping them but that\u2019s a you issue.  \n\nIf Ben doesn\u2019t want his gf\u2019s dad as his landlord that\u2019s fair. But expecting OP to downgrade her life to cater to him isn\u2019t.", "> And he isn\u2019t too bright if he thinks moving too a new place where he would pay even more is a reasonable option\n\nIf he move into a new place where he was splitting the rent with op, it would cost him less. This isn't a good deal for him. I wouldn't take it either. I wouldn't want to move in or build a life with someone who is still financially relying on their parents.", "Wait wait wait. You just said in the same post:\n\n\"No one gives a shit what the market value of your dad\u2019s apartment is.\"\n\nAnd\n\n\"You want people to take your side, then you need to be transparent about:\n\n-market value of your fathers place\"\n\nWhich is it?\n\nAlso no none of your points matter. At the end of the day, her bf can keep paying the same as what he is now for a worse location or pay what he is for a better location. This is a win win for him if he can get his ego out of the way.", "Unless you and your dad share a bank account, it wouldn't be redundant. \n\nIf you and your dad do share a bank account, that's a whole other can of worms.", "Do you really not understand the power dynamic at play? I know you say BF will have a lease, but landlords can make life hell for tenants. Your BF isn't saving any money and he also has to worry about getting in an argument with you because you hold all the cards in regards to the living space. \n\nBe honest with yourself. If you break up during the term of the lease, would your dad still treat him the same? Or would his quality of life get worse?", "Why is it a waste of money to move out of ur parents place? Sounds like a normal thing adult couples do when a relationship is getting serious, but what do i know. He didn\u2019t give her an ultimatum. They are still together.", "Only after he found out he would have to pay rent. She has a job, she isn\u2019t fully dependent on her Dad. If the boyfriend doesn\u2019t like it he can find a different partner. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t move out of a place where I didn\u2019t have to pay rent if I was happy with the accommodation. Seems like a waste of money", "I was reading that it was an independent apartment owned by the dad. Technically it's owned by her parents, but who wouldn't take free rent in a place way out of their league? Especially if it's independent living. That's just being smart with money imo.", "So essentially he's working for her, since he works his job and pays rent to the dad who she can openly take money from, and will end up in her pocket anyway...still don't see anything wrong?", "For Ben, too.", "Someone who clearly isn\u2019t ready for independence. Which is fine, but bf is not ah.", "Did you stretch before you reached?\n\nWorking for someone means you perform a service and they issue you a payment and/or you perform a service out of debt or force. Her boyfriend does not work for her or her dad. Just like the boyfriend doesn\u2019t work for his current landlord either. So your silly statement made no sense.\n\nOP\u2019s dad has the right to give her money as freely as he wants. It\u2019s none of her boyfriend\u2019s business. \n\nIf he doesn\u2019t like the living situation then he doesn\u2019t have to move in. But the idea that she\u2019s supposed to downgrade her life to suit him while he upgrades his is absurd."]}
