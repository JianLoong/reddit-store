I (28m) have a 9-5 so whenever im off work, she\u2019s usually heading to work. I\u2019m an introvert and and bars aren\u2019t really my thing, but once in a while I\u2019d drive her to work and sip a beer while waiting till she\u2019s done & drive her back home. \n\nLast month, it was our wedding anniversary and we both had to work, so I decided to drive her to work and hang there so we can sorta spend some time near each other. When we got to the bar, there was a new bartender I haven\u2019t met yet also working, we\u2019ll call her \u201cKylie\u201d. \nNear the end of the night, a few minutes before she started closing, I told Nat I\u2019d wait for her at the back room till she\u2019s done. While waiting, I could hear Nat and Kylie closing up and chatting with each other, and I heard Kylie said to Nat something along the lines of:\n\n\u201c Did you see that creep sitting alone at the bar all night? Seems like he was trying to talk to you and bothering you, & he kept looking at you, it was so creepy. Like as if he\u2019d ever have a chance. Im calling security when I see him next time. Nat, you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to keep talking to creeps like that while working, I hope you didn\u2019t give him your info, he is literally too ugly for you.\u201d Nat promptly described what I was wearing to confirm who she was talking about and told her that\u2019s her husband. I heard Kylie just  laughed , and quickly changed the subject. \n\nFirst of all, my wife wasn\u2019t bothered by me talking to her, she\u2019s actually the one who insisted I sit at the bar while she\u2019s working so that we can sorta spend some time together on our anniversary.\n\nSecond, I wasn\u2019t being creepy, I was looking at MY OWN WIFE because it was, again, our anniversary, and I was reminiscing about our wedding day. I was either talking to her or on my phone or just spacing out while I was sitting there. \n\nAnyways i told Nat what I overheard on the drive back and she just laughed it off and thought it was funny which is fine. But last week Kylie and I met formally for the first time at their coworker\u2019s Christmas party , and I was distant and cold to Kylie all night long because I don\u2019t like someone so judgmental. I barely acknowledged Kylie and I don\u2019t know if she knows that I overheard but neither of us addressed it. I just minded my own business and socialized with everyone at the party but Kylie, I\u2019ll admit I even excused myself from a conversation the moment Kylie joined in. Then I heard the next day that Kylie was telling other people at the bar that I must be an AH because I didn\u2019t acknowledge her all night long at the party. Geez, can this girl stfu about me? I don\u2019t think I was being an AH, I think I should be allowed to mind my own business!

Fist she calls you a creep, then you stay away from her and she wants to talk to you?\n\nI think your wife should definitely set her colleague straight and call her out for her behavior. You called him a creep before because he was waiting for me, his wife to get off work. He overheard because you were anything hut discrete and decided to keep his distance.", "NTA. She sucks, I wouldn't have wanted to spend any time around her either. I'm petty though, so when she tried talking to me, I would have introduced myself to her as the ugly, lonely creep at the bar who has no chance with my wife, just to make her equally uncomfortable and make it perfectly clear that I didn't like her and why", "NTA. As a woman who's worked service jobs, every time myself or a coworker has had issues with a customer we didn't immediately call them a creep; we asked if the other knew the person in question, if they were being bothered, etc. There was 0 reason for Kylie to immediately jump to calling you a creep and threatening to get you kicked out, and it's ridiculous of her to be mad that you didn't want to talk to her after she went on a tirade to your wife about you.", "NTA she absolutely knows you heard her as well.  Especially if you walked out of the establishment.", "NTA. Kylie is a drama Queen.", "NTA. Your wife should just tell her you make it a habit to avoid shitty people. They creep you out. Especially when they seem to need attention.", "NTA. Kylie is trouble. Hopefully she won't last long at your wife's workplace.", "NTA.  Judgmental woman says something awful about you, gets mad when you aren't nice to her as a result.  Oh no, it's the consequences of my actions!", "If you\u2019re ugly, you\u2019re a creep, but if you looked handsome it would not be creepy. NTA, and I don\u2019t think sitting alone at the bar making conversation by itself would be creepy in any circumstance, unless however, the person in question was leering obviously, harassing, giving obviously unwanted attention. Someone\u2019s looks doesn\u2019t inherently make them creepy. Age possibly, but today\u2019s society has a lot of double standards when it comes to this subject. Don\u2019t let it bother you. I would have confronted her in front of everybody, but then again im an Ahole.", "NTA. Maybe what she meant by creep is that she perceives you as an unattractive man. Creep or creepy is a euphemism some women use to describe men they find undesirable. You are allowed to feel disrespected and judged by Kylie. And even in the case where she had not disrespected or judged you, you still have the right not engage with her. She will continue to talk about you as this is part of her character.", "ESH. \n\nKylie completely put her foot in it, went way too hard on you, and was super judgemental and rude. In addition, she probably thought she was looking out for your wife. Certainly not in a pragmatic or healthy way, but it\u2019s nice to know your wife has a colleague who would warn her about guys sitting at the bar staring at her all night. In summary, Kylie is probably somewhere between accidental AH to actual AH. \n\nOn your part, you probably didn\u2019t need to avoid/ignore her at the party. There was an opportunity to fix things and maybe even call her out on it in a good-natured way, but you chose to purposefully exclude her and be cold instead. This is someone your wife will need to see on a regular basis. Just for choosing to engage in that behaviour, you were a bit of an AH too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This girl sucks, she is likely both jealous of your wife, and also trying to impress her with unnecessary gossip. \nOne time when lifeguarding at then end of a shift my coworker was like, what\u2019s with the creepy old guy who comes at the end of the day everyday? He just sits there with his beer, starring. She then pointed at my Dad \ud83e\udd23 Sometimes your unexplained comfort in a situation just makes others feel uneasy", "That's why people, that includes family and friends and work friends, have no business in someone's relationship   besides the two people in that relationship!", "Another soft YTA; my wife is a former bartender and I've been on the receiving end of this situation. I've even been told directly by some of her former coworkers, once we've been properly introduced, that they thought I was just some dude trying to shoot my shot. There *are* a lot of creeps out there; I'm sure Kylie (and your wife!) has been on the receiving end of it a lot.\n\nWithout the context of knowing you're her husband, it seems like Kylie's guard was up \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "NAH. As a woman, I would think just like Kylie. She was looking out for your wife, which was actually really nice, and she backed off as soon as she realized you were hubbie. \n\nIt remains NAH so long as you try to be more polite to Kylie in the future - she's \"judgemental\" because women have to be in order to keep themselves and others safe.", "Soft YTA not for ignoring her party, but for not acknowledging that WITHOUT the knowledge that you were Nat\u2019s husband, of course Kylie is going to think you were creepy! Particularly if your wife wears a wedding ring. Try and view that scene from her perspective.", "You should\u2019ve told the crew \u201cyou guys see this creepy ass girl who keeps coming over & saying hi to me? Babe, you know you don\u2019t have to deal with creepy co-workers, right? She\u2019s literally too ugly to get tips so she\u2019s trying to come over here & talk to me? Really? You guys want me to say something to this lady?\u201d", "Kylie sounds like the one with issues. \n\nIt was one thing if she thought you were a creep because she didn't know you were the husband. But she went on to be insulting about your appearance. Then wonders why you are distant to her. \n\nYou can't win with the Kylies of this world. \n\nNTA", "NTA, and you arent obliged to interact with people who insult you behind your back.\n\nIf she brings it up call her out if you want, i would just laugh in their face tbh to make them realize how stupid they were", "Some women these days can be very judgmental of men.  Men don't have to put up with that.  Once a woman calls a dude creepy, he does not have to put up with her anymore.  And he does not owe her a second chance."]}
