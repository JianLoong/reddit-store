She'd walk with me to and from school, we'd watch movies and shows together, and she'd play games with me when she wasn't busy.\n\nMy girlfriend had told me that she was throwing a Halloween party earlier this month, but she never told me the date. I just assumed it would be on Halloween so I told her I'd be there. 5 days ago, we were talking about it and she told me it was going to be on the 29th, since it was a Saturday. As you can guess, the 29th was also K's birthday and my family always throws her a party.\n\nI told my girlfriend about K's birthday party and how I wanted to be there for that, and she was upset. I came up with the idea to first hang out at K's party for an hour or two, then head over to my girlfriend's party after, but she got mad saying she wanted me to be there to help set up and also she didn't want to be alone when people started coming. She also reminded me about how I already agreed to go to the party.\n\nShe gave me the choice of either being there for the full thing or just not showing up at all, and the day before the party, I texted saying I wasn't going to the party. She's been mad at me and has been giving me the silent treatment since then.\n\nSo AITA?\n\nEdit: I didn't think this was necessary at first, but after reading some comments I'm putting this in. I assumed the party would be on Halloween night, even on a Monday, because at the school I attend, we don't have to go in on November 1st. Apparently it was sort of an annual thing where there'd be a handful of students who were showing up to school hungover after partying on Halloween night. It was a big enough issue where it was decided that when applicable, there'd be no school November 1st and one day would just be removed from winter break.", "created_utc": 1667263981, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yiu8uk/aita_for_skipping_my_girlfriends_halloween_party/", "score": 193, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Don't put long and meaningful relationships like you have with this maid who was essentially a second mother to you aside for a high school girlfriend.

You picked one of those choices she gave you.  I understand why she'd be disappointed but you offered a perfectly reasonable compromise to spend most of the night with her.  \n\nHonestly it would have been good to double check the date as Halloween is on a school day this year vs Saturday being the 'party night'.  \n\nBut good for you for appreciating K, I'm sure she loves you & your family very much. If you'd of told your GF that it was your Aunts birthday would she be upset? K is just as much part of your family as any blood relative.", "NTA she gave you an ultimatum, she's the asshole.", "Nta \n\nIt's not like you said you wouldn't go at all, your gf is a brat.

When you agreed to go to your gf's party, you had already committed to celebrate the birthday of the woman who was more of a mother to you than your actual mother.

You have a perfectly reasonable compromise and she still chose to give you an ultimatimatum. It's selfish and immature of her to expect you to just be free to be with her at the drop of a hat. If you beinf there to help with the party was so important, she should've discussed the party date with you earlier so you could choose the date together.
