I don\u2019t know when/where he\u2019ll pop the question, but sometime in 2023. He\u2019s been very upfront that he wants me to have as much input as possible on my engagement ring, and we\u2019re working with a company that designs/makes custom rings. \n\nHere\u2019s where my dilemma comes in: I\u2019ve never wanted a diamond ring. (I understand the classic appeal, and diamonds are gorgeous, it\u2019s just not for me!) Instead I want a sapphire ring. Blue is one of my favorite colors, and I have bright blue eyes. My partner also says that my eyes are what he noticed first about me and he regularly tells me how much he loves them. Whenever I imagine my wedding day, I\u2019m wearing a sapphire ring. \n\nWhen we were visiting my family for the holidays, my mom asked about the ring, and I told her that we were still working on a design, but that it\u2019d be a sapphire. My older sister (35F) overheard this and lost it. Sapphire is her birthstone, and throughout our childhoods, we always got color-coordinated stuff. Blue for her, red for me (garnet is my birthstone). Like if we got sweaters, mine would be red and hers would be blue. I\u2019ve never really liked red, but that\u2019s just the way it was.\n\nMy sister said that she couldn\u2019t believe that I was considering a sapphire ring, when I knew it was HER birthstone. She told me I was pathetic and attention-seeking for getting a non-diamond ring, and that I should know that blue is her color. She said that everyone in the family will think it\u2019s weird and inappropriate for my engagement ring to have her birthstone. \n\nFor some extra info, my sister doesn\u2019t wear sapphire jewelry with any regularity and she got married four years ago. Her engagement ring and wedding band both have diamonds, so it\u2019s not like I\u2019m \u201cstealing\u201d sapphires or a ring idea from her. \n\nWIBTA for going with my original/dream ring, even if it pisses off my sister?\n\nTLDR: I want a sapphire engagement ring. Older sister says that because it\u2019s her birthstone, I can\u2019t.\n\nETA: Lots of people commenting/asking if my sister hates on other people having sapphire jewelry. Nope! Not that I know of. I think it\u2019s just *my* ring that\u2019s the problem. Also, I know that this is a minor issue and seemed like a no-brainer to me. My sister and I don\u2019t have the best relationship, and her vehemence really got in my head a bit, hence my post.", "created_utc": 1673742331, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10c5eep/wibta_if_my_engagement_ring_had_my_sisters/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It gave me a little giggle, he probably didn\u2019t even think of it.", "Get a Tanzanite ring, it's almost the same color as Sapphire except many are even more beautiful, and it's from only one mind Tanzania so there is a finite supply of it. NTA", "NTA.  Get the stone you want, in the colour you want.  Your sister is delusional.  Nobody owns a particular colour or stone.", "Just so you know, most gemstones can be most colors. My gf doesn\u2019t like her birthstone (also garnet) so I sent her this link when talking to her about it https://www.marketsquarejewelers.com/blogs/msj-handbook/ten-varieties-of-garnets-you-should-know\n\nBut get whatever you want. If you want sapphire, get it. If you want rubys, get \u2018em. You want jade, go for it. It\u2019s your wedding and your life, don\u2019t let others dictate what you can and can\u2019t do", "Quick!  Someone contact Windsor Castle and tell Kate Middleton to STOP wearing her sapphire ring cause the stone belongs to your sister exclusively and no one else can use it for an engagement/wedding ring.  Of all the ridiculous hills to die on . . .  NTA", "Right, next she\u2019ll claim hair length.  \u201cBut I always had long hair so you can\u2019t!\u201d  [insert foot stomp]", "My birthstone is Topaz (yellow/orange) but there is a blue version which I much prefer. Wonder if that would bother her too. She's a little touchy...", "My birthstone is a diamond. Imagine how stupid it'd be if I tried forbidding my siblings from proposing with one.", "Hahaha she doesn\u2019t care about other people\u2019s rings, to clarify. I think it\u2019s more about *me* having a sapphire ring because she\u2019s always gotten blue blue blue stuff. I did push back on her claim and made a few of the same points you did! We don\u2019t have a close relationship, and I keep pretty firm boundaries most of the time, but idk, she got in my head a bit with this!", ">How would everyone know it\u2019s HER birth stone?\n\nHow many people even know their own birthstone, let alone someone else's? I'd wager most people don't.", "This! It's not like only people born in April can wear diamonds. This isn't even I thing.", "Believe me, it was not the reaction I was expecting.", "HA, I\u2019ve been iffy on wearing a white dress actually. I want SOME kind of color\u2026maybe I\u2019ll do a blue underskirt or something lol", "Why should she look at other colors or stones if she loves the sapphire?", "And Di's birthstone was ruby. Red, not blue!", "I color code things for my kids all the time and it is \"their color\" but only as far as stuff at home goes(ie each kid has their own towel color and each has an assigned cup color for the day ect) bit thats never made then feel like they \"own\" the color and can claim it and prevent its use by others. \nIf I ever marry the father of my youngest two, he knows I DO NOT want a diamond. I want something pretty. Sapphire, ruby(my stone) amethyst, emerald, ect. \n\nYour sister needs to come back a notch or two.", "I can't imagine a person who thinks they own the color blue and the gemstone of their birth month so much that their family can't wear it. She is so extra. I would save this post and show her the reactions to her nonsense. That should shut her up lol.\n\nTell her you've chosen her birthday as your wedding day and watch her head spin, haha", "It sounds like she wants there to be a problem. Get married on her birthday, match her energy.", "Sapphire is my birthstone too OP. And guess what? I've decided you can have it for your ring seeing as how we own birthstones and all.\n\nYour sister is nuts lol. Literally no one else will care what stone you use and I'm pretty sure sapphire is also a common alternative people get for engagement rings. I didn't even think anyone cared this much about birthstones.", "Sapphires don't have to be blue; they can be just about any color but red (because if they are red they are called rubies.). So she shouldn't assume you want a blue ring just because you want a Sapphire.", "Just out of curiosity, I wonder how she would react if you said it'd be aquamarine instead. Its still blue, but its Marchs birthstone so she can't claim any authority over it. I'm not saying to give up your dream, you should 100% get your sapphire ring. But I'd be interested to see her reaction.\n\nEdit: typo", "Can't your ring be your something blue? forgive me if this is wrong cuz my knowledge of weddings comes from mostly movies.\nAlso look into star sapphires. I saw them on tiktok and thought they looked gorgeous.", "I'm kind of curious, would she blow up if you had a pink sapphire? What about a darker aquamarine? Blue topaz? Just wondering which one would make her most mad.....\n\nI'm voting for white sapphire center stone with side blue stones, just to really annoy her.", "I don\u2019t know mine.", "Oh *shit.* We color-coded things as kids, green was my favorite color and my brother's was blue.
