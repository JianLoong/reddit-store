The apartment is a beautiful 2br 2bth apartment in the center of the city near most universities. One of the bedrooms is huge and actually has a sort of division made to create a home office space, it's almost too much space for only one person, and two people sleep there comfortably. \n\nWe have a deal with my grandparents, I can live there for free while renting the extra room for two other roommates and take care of the whole process, and whatever I make by renting goes to my grandparents. \n\nA thing about me is that I am quite \"girly\" and my apartment shows it, a lot of my furniture is pink.\n\nBy the end of last year, both of my roommates finished their degrees and stopped living with me. \n\nI accepted another roommate but when we were finishing the process of her moving in, there was a major plumbing disaster in my building that left one of the bathrooms unusable, I talked to her and asked her what she wanted to do, that I could reimburse her with anything she had already put into the apartment and she refused and said she didn't mind using the bathroom that is ensuite with my bedroom, I agreed. I told her because there is only one bathroom I wouldn't be looking for another roommate until the issue was resolved, so she would have the bedroom to herself for a while, but after that, she would have to share a room, she said she was okay with that.\n\nThe bathroom took longer than I expected to be fully fixed but it has been fixed for about a month now. I started the search for another roommate and last week I interviewed a boy who matched all the requisites I was looking for, he was 21, also a student, and had a very positive review from her former tenant, he also studied to be a chef, which is a nice plus. \n\nWhen I told my roommate that I was planning on making him the third roommate she seemed disappointed and eventually sat me down and told me she didn't feel comfortable with sharing a room with a man, and that she sort of always expected the third roommate to be a girl because of how my apartment looks, she didn't expect a man to want to live here.\n\nI sort of understand where she is coming from, I've lived with men my entire life and feel comfortable around them but I can understand why she wouldn't. At the same time, I never agreed to only accept other girls or that she could have a say in who would be the third roommate. I could look for another female roommate but it would take a lot of extra time and turning down a perfectly fine potential roommate who is really looking forward to living here. \n\nWIBTA if I still accepted him?\n\nedit: I took your comments into consideration and was thinking how to solve this if it wasn't because the potential roommate just called me and told me that my current roommate and her friends have been sending him homophobic insults on Instagram saying nobody would want to live with him so yikes. Honestly apart from that she hasn't been the best roommate for a variety of reasons so I will probably tell her she will be moving in may 15th and she has until then to find another place if she doesn't agree with this, I will reimburse her her deposit, I don't hold hard feelings I'd just really rather live with a man than an homophobe, I'll look for other roommates later if she leaves, which I guess she will.\n\nAnother thing I would like to say is even though I accept the asshole verdict I feel you've been unnecessary harsh and insulting, neither did I kick her out or invalidate her feelings. I guess just from personal experience it wasn't a big issue for me to share a room with a man, I understand why it would be different for other people, however I hadn't yet assured him we would house him or told her to suck it up, I was supposed to make a choice by the end of the week and needed a third judgement.

Without explicit notice, she could expect that her roommate would be of the same gender as she is. That\u2019s the standard, deviating from the standard should have been communicated. So not communicating gender is on your risk, not on hers imo.", "YTA. Why the hell would two random adults pay to share a bedroom together?", "YWBTA.   \nAlthough you are in charge of this apartment I think you really should have made clear that you would be looking for roommates of any gender. It was reasonable of your current roommate to assume they'd be sharing with another female, especially as they'd be sleeping in the same room.

Why not share the room with her and move the new roommate into your former room?", "YTA. It's common sense that making a woman share a room with a strange man is going to make her uncomfortable. Honestly it would be weirder if she was comfortable with this.  Also, if she is an established member of the household and will be sharing her room with whoever moves in, she should really be involved in the process of finding the new room mate with you.

If you do accept him, let her out of her lease so she can move. He may be a wonderful guy but she isn't being unreasonable.", "YWBTA - if you really want this, then maybe you should move into the shared room and let her (or him) have the single room. It is different sharing an apartment than having to share a bedroom/bathroom with someone. You both made assumptions - she assumed it would be a female roommate and you assumed she wouldn\u2019t care who she shared a room with. If I were her, I probably would have assumed it would be a female as well. Keep looking for another roommate.", "YTA for even thinking that a random man share a room with a random woman. That is absolutely not a good idea. Do you live on planet earth??", "YWBTA.  She already said she is uncomfortable sharing a room with a male.  That should be the end of the discussion unless you decide to share her room and give your current room to the male.  Your current roommate should not be required to do something that makes her uncomfortable.", "YTA You shouldn't assume that someone would be ok with sharing a room with a member of the opposite gender. Also there should be consultation even if they are the same gender to see if can actually get along to avoid issues. Don't you want to avoid roommate issues?", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re trying to force her to share a bedroom with someone she isn\u2019t comfortable with - AH. Trying to force her to share an *apartment* with someone, without some say in which person that was, would be a bit of a dick move.  Expecting her to share the actual bedroom without any input into who she shares it with is completely unreasonable. \n\nHer assumption that the 3rd person would be a girl may not have been something you explicitly agreed to, but it was a completely reasonable assumption for her to make. Most women would know better than to try to make another woman share a bedroom with a man they don\u2019t know. \n\nIf you\u2019re so set on having this man in the apartment then *you* share the big bedroom with him and let her have your room.", "YTA.

If you're okay with it and its no big deal, YOU share a room with them.  Problem solved.", "YWBTA - I see you are still trying to defend it even though the majority seem to tell you that you wrong.  If an assault were to occur, how would spin it?", "YTA. \n\nI don\u2019t even know what to say to this except that if I were her I\u2019d move out. There\u2019s just no way I\u2019d be comfortable sharing a ROOM with a man. And I just can\u2019t believe you\u2019re expecting her to be okay with that.", "YTA. You sound like a character the evil reach people we see in the movies. Putting a women in constant fear of rape just because grandma gave you an apartment. I hope the tenant reaches your grandma and she would kick your evil little butt out.", "YTA\n\nYou share if it doesn't matter.", "YTA. You want her to share a room with a strange man. And room dividers are not enough. We are talking about how she won\u2019t feel comfortable changing in her own room because he could technically walk in on her or feel safe, because HE. IS. A. STRANGER. Just because you don\u2019t have a problem with unknown men, doesn\u2019t mean she hasn\u2019t. Her experiences can be very different from yours and you clearly don\u2019t care.

Evict the woman who accommodate to your needs? You are a major A.", "YTA if you are expecting her to share a bedroom and bathroom with someone, it should be someone she is comfortable with.  Telling her she \"has no say\" is rather rude and inconsiderate, and it's also inappropriate to expect her to be fine sharing a bedroom and bathroom with a man she doesn't even know.\n\nIf you insist on this guy, why don't you and your female roommate share and he gets the solo room, or you and he share?  If she's paying rent, she has a right to feel comfortable and safe in her own home.", "YTA.

Are you truly so blinded by money that you would let a girl feel unsafe?\n\nYTA a million times.\n\nEDIT: Even after the update is an ESH at the most. Two AH don't make a N T A.

All yes = yes, 1 no= no.", "YWBTA. First of all, let's not act like you worked hard for this apartment. You were handed it on a silver platter, good for you. It doesn't give you the right to exercise this kind of power over your roommates. Let's be honest, you are asking two people to do what you won't do, because many people have mentioned that since you're so cultured and worldly and you share rooms with men all the time, why don't *you* share the room with him. You won't, because you think you're more important and because you were born into the family you were *you shouldn't have to share a room*, and you are trying to exert power whether you realize it or not. You rake in their money, not caring about the actual comfort and happiness of your roommates. Which by the way, is a great way to get horrible reviews/recommendations. All you're thinking about is the money aspect, clearly. You've shared rooms with men for short periods. You're asking them to *live* together. Is it really that crazy to think that maybe a random guy doesn't want his stranger female roommate to see his morning wood? Or maybe she doesn't want to see it? Or how maybe she might bleed through her night clothes on a particularly heavy flow, and now has to waddle to the bathroom in front of her stranger male roommate? Or maybe, just maybe, the fact that he looks good on paper doesn't actually mean much when we see so many men from top notch institutions committing assaults, and that *scares your current roommate?* Everything they do in their room they will have to think twice as hard about now, because you are trying to put two total strangers of the opposite sex in a room with zero real regard for how they feel. Not only that, you won't give up your nepo baby single room to make it work, either. You'd rather just force it, get your cake and eat it too.

I find it hard to believe you explained to him he'd be sharing a room with some random woman and he was fine with that. And if he is fine with it, that's a red flag. How would I know she's not batshit crazy and might accuse me of rape? And how the hell would I ever have a GF who's okay with me sharing a room with another woman?

If they had an issue with gender, the onus is on the tenant to have made it clear before-hand.\n\nIt is not a landlord's job or expectation to only admit room-mates that the other room-mates find agreeable.", "Yeah that edit came conveniently when the tide was going YTA  I highly doubt that the roommate and her friends made homophobic slurs--though I would believe it if they were publicly calling out OP for trying to force their friend to share a small bedroom with a strange man.  OP is 100% the AH here.", "She is taking advantage of no one, you are essentially saying charging people rent is morally wrong.\n\nShe also doesnt own the apartment and the owners expect do receive rent from 2 tenants, no one is forced to rent any particular place and the roommate knew that they would have to share a room.\n\nOP would be an AH if they forced  the roommate to share with a man, if they aren't comfortable with that.", "Many states in the US won\u2019t allow foster children of opposite sexes to share a room above a certain age, if at all. The idea of a \u201clandlord\u201d placing random strangers of opposite sexes in the same room without that being *very* clearly discussed before leases were signed is unthinkable.", "Roommates like this just aren't common at all in other countries. I'd be fucking mortified having to share a room at university at all, never mind with a MAN", "I don't either.\n\nThe mean edit really shows that OP was emotionally effected by the judgements. What can stop further YTAs? Editing the other side into a perfect asshole.\n\nThe first and second edit wouldn't have been posted if the majority consensus was that she's NTA.", "I don't care if he's assexual, if someone has to share a bedroom with someone, they need to be comfortable with the person.", "To be fair, the post has only been up for five hours", "I don\u2019t know\u2026 the edit happened when the top ruling by far was AH, so she had no reason to make this up. Plus she'd hardly be the first redditor to get nasty stuff in her DM.", "Or they\u2019re calling him gay because he's wanting to move into a girly flat. OP never said that he was actually gay (and if he was, he wouldn\u2019t have been a threat).", "A lot of Europeans also end high school (some people call it primary school) a bit earlier than most Americans do, and the pre-university education is also usually overall superior to American public schooling. Thanks to our right wing politicians, we've gradually had the quality of our public schools whittled away the past 30+ years so our average college freshman is often less \"educated\" than a teenager not even in college yet in many other countries. Hooray fascism!", "She\u2019s trying to force two people to share one (\u201cspacious\u201d) bedroom and charge them both rent so she can have her own bedroom and not pay anything Morals and ethics differ greatly from person to person so you don\u2019t have to agree but i believe that is unethical. Two adult strangers don\u2019t need to share a bed room so she can live for free and her grandparents can profit.  There are more ethical ways to make money. In my opinion.", "And in 5 hours, she suddenly got confirmation that her current roommate is a homophobe, with receipts? The roommate organized a random hate campaign toward the potential tenant in that same timeframe?", "> the edit happened when the top ruling by far was AH\n\nThis is exactly when OP's will introduce the show-stopping details that completely contextualize the post.\n\nFor what it's worth, I don't doubt shitty DMs, but that's a negative side effect of virtually all semi-anonymous social media. A certain subset of people are absolutely demonic behind a mask of anonymity. My doubt of the edit's veracity directly links to sudden major information that would significantly change the judgment people would make.", "uhmm just because he's gay doesn't mean he isn't a threat? or that someone cant be made to feel uncomfortable by their presence simply because they are a stranger. like i was with you but that last bit was odd", "No one wa forced, this was all part of the original rent agreement. Making a profit is not immoral.", "As soon as the guy moves in the roommate doesn't have a place to sleep. So no, she is functionally being thrown out.", "Brilliant \ud83e\udd23what\u2019s the point of people coming on here if you aren\u2019t going to believe them\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "If it was a show-stopping detail, I\u2019d concur, like, btw, the guy is gay. But in this case, she's saying that her roommate and friends are engaging in social bullying by calling the potential roommate gay, probably for wanting to move into a girly flat. He might be gay, but considering he's willing to share a room, he might also be desperate for housing.", "Well the roommate has to leave if she doesn\u2019t like it soo it\u2019s not exactly optional.  I understand she\u2019s not threatening her life, but that doesn\u2019t matter. To me, making a profit in this was is immoral.", "Wait till the soon to be ex-roommate goes to landlord/tenant court. OP will be in fir an unhappy surprise.", "Yep, if it\u2019s not clear, I think what she\u2019s doing is wrong.", "The option  would of been to not rent the place if the roommate was opposed to sharing a room. The point of renting a room is to profit, and nobody was tricked into this deal, so I fail to comprehend how anything immoral is taking place.Roommate could pay double and not share if that's what she wants."]}
