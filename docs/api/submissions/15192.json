Without explicit notice, she could expect that her roommate would be of the same gender as she is. That\u2019s the standard, deviating from the standard should have been communicated. So not communicating gender is on your risk, not on hers imo.", "YTA. Why the hell would two random adults pay to share a bedroom together?", "YWBTA.   \nAlthough you are in charge of this apartment I think you really should have made clear that you would be looking for roommates of any gender. It was reasonable of your current roommate to assume they'd be sharing with another female, especially as they'd be sleeping in the same room.

It is very important to take their thoughts and feelings into account as well.", "YTA. If she has to share a room with a person, you should definitely make sure she is comfortable with them.

It's not reasonable to expect a woman to share a room with a male roommate unless she's comfortable with that.", "Well, she\u2019s not going to stay if she\u2019s uncomfortable with who you decide to move in to her room share, and then you\u2019ll be taking all that extra time to find a new roommate to replace her.

Still, I expect that chef is really looking forward to being expected to cook for you as well as at work. Yes, YTA.", "YTA.  Why not share the room with her and move the new roommate into your former room?", "YTA. It's common sense that making a woman share a room with a strange man is going to make her uncomfortable. Honestly it would be weirder if she was comfortable with this.  Also, if she is an established member of the household and will be sharing her room with whoever moves in, she should really be involved in the process of finding the new room mate with you.

If you do accept him, let her out of her lease so she can move. He may be a wonderful guy but she isn't being unreasonable.", "YWBTA - if you really want this, then maybe you should move into the shared room and let her (or him) have the single room. It is different sharing an apartment than having to share a bedroom/bathroom with someone. You both made assumptions - she assumed it would be a female roommate and you assumed she wouldn\u2019t care who she shared a room with. If I were her, I probably would have assumed it would be a female as well. Keep looking for another roommate.", "YTA for even thinking that a random man share a room with a random woman. That is absolutely not a good idea. Do you live on planet earth??", "YWBTA.  She already said she is uncomfortable sharing a room with a male.  That should be the end of the discussion unless you decide to share her room and give your current room to the male.  Your current roommate should not be required to do something that makes her uncomfortable.", "YTA You shouldn't assume that someone would be ok with sharing a room with a member of the opposite gender. Also there should be consultation even if they are the same gender to see if can actually get along to avoid issues. Don't you want to avoid roommate issues?", "YTA\n\nYou\u2019re trying to force her to share a bedroom with someone she isn\u2019t comfortable with - AH. Trying to force her to share an *apartment* with someone, without some say in which person that was, would be a bit of a dick move.  Expecting her to share the actual bedroom without any input into who she shares it with is completely unreasonable. \n\nHer assumption that the 3rd person would be a girl may not have been something you explicitly agreed to, but it was a completely reasonable assumption for her to make. Most women would know better than to try to make another woman share a bedroom with a man they don\u2019t know. \n\nIf you\u2019re so set on having this man in the apartment then *you* share the big bedroom with him and let her have your room.", "YTA.

You\u2019re a nasty roommate and person if you go through with it.", "YWBTA\n\nForcing two opposite sex people to sleep in the same room and PAY RENT while doing it when they aren't comfortable \\*not to mention yo, that's really fucking weird okay\\*  isn't cool. If you're okay with it and its no big deal, YOU share a room with them.  Problem solved.", "YWBTA - I see you are still trying to defend it even though the majority seem to tell you that you wrong.  If an assault were to occur, how would spin it?", "YTA. \n\nI don\u2019t even know what to say to this except that if I were her I\u2019d move out. There\u2019s just no way I\u2019d be comfortable sharing a ROOM with a man. And I just can\u2019t believe you\u2019re expecting her to be okay with that.", "YTA. You sound like a character the evil reach people we see in the movies. Putting a women in constant fear of rape just because grandma gave you an apartment. I hope the tenant reaches your grandma and she would kick your evil little butt out.", "YTA\n\nYou share if it doesn't matter.", "YTA. You want her to share a room with a strange man. And room dividers are not enough. We are talking about how she won\u2019t feel comfortable changing in her own room because he could technically walk in on her or feel safe, because HE. IS. A. STRANGER. Just because you don\u2019t have a problem with unknown men, doesn\u2019t mean she hasn\u2019t. Her experiences can be very different from yours and you clearly don\u2019t care. I can not even highlight how much of an AH you are.", "YTA.

Evict the woman who accommodate to your needs? You are a major A.", "YTA if you are expecting her to share a bedroom and bathroom with someone, it should be someone she is comfortable with.  Telling her she \"has no say\" is rather rude and inconsiderate, and it's also inappropriate to expect her to be fine sharing a bedroom and bathroom with a man she doesn't even know.\n\nIf you insist on this guy, why don't you and your female roommate share and he gets the solo room, or you and he share?  If she's paying rent, she has a right to feel comfortable and safe in her own home.", "YTA.

I feel so sorry for her.", "Yta, roommate rules, regardless of the size of space or who owns/leases the space. All yes = yes, 1 no= no.", "YWBTA. First of all, let's not act like you worked hard for this apartment. You were handed it on a silver platter, good for you. It doesn't give you the right to exercise this kind of power over your roommates. Let's be honest, you are asking two people to do what you won't do, because many people have mentioned that since you're so cultured and worldly and you share rooms with men all the time, why don't *you* share the room with him. You won't, because you think you're more important and because you were born into the family you were *you shouldn't have to share a room*, and you are trying to exert power whether you realize it or not. You rake in their money, not caring about the actual comfort and happiness of your roommates. Which by the way, is a great way to get horrible reviews/recommendations. All you're thinking about is the money aspect, clearly. You've shared rooms with men for short periods. You're asking them to *live* together. Is it really that crazy to think that maybe a random guy doesn't want his stranger female roommate to see his morning wood? Or maybe she doesn't want to see it? Or how maybe she might bleed through her night clothes on a particularly heavy flow, and now has to waddle to the bathroom in front of her stranger male roommate? Or maybe, just maybe, the fact that he looks good on paper doesn't actually mean much when we see so many men from top notch institutions committing assaults, and that *scares your current roommate?* Everything they do in their room they will have to think twice as hard about now, because you are trying to put two total strangers of the opposite sex in a room with zero real regard for how they feel. Not only that, you won't give up your nepo baby single room to make it work, either. You'd rather just force it, get your cake and eat it too.

YTA.\n\nI'm a man and I would be uncomfortable sharing that room with her because I would know I would be making her uncomfortable. In fact, I just wouldn't do it. I find it hard to believe you explained to him he'd be sharing a room with some random woman and he was fine with that. And if he is fine with it, that's a red flag. How would I know she's not batshit crazy and might accuse me of rape? And how the hell would I ever have a GF who's okay with me sharing a room with another woman?

I am laughing at this attempted justification here.", "YTA, no matter how you try to spin it. Your very inconsiderate too. If I where her I\u2019d stop paying rent and keep on living there since her feeling don\u2019t matter to you.", "i really hope you get it through your head that you are TA here. A massive, massive one", "So you have a problem with sharing a room with a man, but you want her to share it even after she said it made her uncomfortable? You are really a piece of work. YTA.", "Why bother posting here if you were just gonna double down and argue with everyone?", "Ah, so you're lazy. YTA for sure.", "find another angle to troll with", "[removed]", "I know in certain cultures and religions, even sharing the same house would be a huge no-no and would actually cause the woman\u2019s reputation to be ruined probably beyond repair. The same room? Might as well get married because that\u2019s the only way that woman would ever be able to finish school, get a job, have a family\u2026", "Oh I mean I agree on the sentiment but she signed a lease knowing she\u2019s living dorm style so she gets a roommate. Still, the roommate should be someone she\u2019s comfortable with which seems to be OP. If the male HAD to live here then OP sharing with the current tenant would be best solution. \n\nReally the best possible solution is for OP to find a new prospective tenant that the current one is comfortable sharing a room with.", "Yeah that's not how things work if there's a lease and you're in the shared room. OP should def consider her current roommates feelings when finding a person who will be sharing a room with her. But in no way should op have to give up her room. \n\nThe roommate signed up to be living in a room with someone else, had there been no bathroom issue, she would have been moved in with someone else without her say. Things don't just change because the roommate is comfortable living by her self now. \n\nOp should find someone that works with her roommate but if the roommate is just pushing so she can have her own room then op is prob within her rights to find other roommates.", "She signed the lease expecting the roommate. You're infantilizing women rn and it's so cringe.", "But what I mean is the concerns OP has are things that they\u2019re making the roommate deal with. Why are they okay putting that on others but not themself? Like the roommates belongings have just as much of a chance of being stolen as OP\u2019s would if they switched rooms", "I mean, why was the assumption that she wouldn't rent to a man? That's on the roommate for assuming that, not OP", "Well to be fair it is kind of the roommates fault for assuming a male student wouldn't move in because the apartment is pink. According to OP the roommate even said that they just believe that no man would apply not that male people are completely left out of the application\n\nAnd just to make sure I don't think that OP is not an asshole if she forces the roommate to live with anyone she doesn't feel comfortable around", "roomate already has to deal with the lack of privacy that ops bf brings when he comes over and now she wants to take away all privacy and sense of security as well bc f\\*ck her opinions and discomforts\n\nway to go girl\n\nYTA big time", "Does \"sincerely held beliefs\" not matter at all to you gender/religion trolls?\n\n Or is acting in bad faith such second nature to you thag this is the only joke you can come up with during discussions like these?", "Oh I see I see. Always hard to read meaning through text. Honestly, yes, completely agree with you.", "No you're misreading my comment. I'm def against the OP trying to bring this guy in. The roomates feelings are important to consider.", "? I'm not sure what you're trying to say. That women shouldn't say no to unknown roommates? And the roommate should respect (edit) her feelings? Cause yes. She should", "I would say that first of all it\u2019s OP\u2019s place (well kind of). The fear about the grand-parents stuffs is maybe more about breaking something accidentally than stealing. And also she arranged the room to her liking, to match her stuffs etc. Those are all valid points to why she doesn\u2019t want to switch rooms (at least those are points that I can understand).\n\nWhat I can\u2019t understand is why she is denying the roommate\u2019s feelings and why she try to force her to accept that and also why she never discussed about the potentality that she would rent the room to a man. Like it\u2019s basic communication and easy thing to do to avoid any problem while looking for a second person.", "Co-ed floors in dorms are still single-sex rooms. Even most suites where multiple people have their own rooms but share communal living spaces are usually single sex within the suite. This is the norm and unless it was specified otherwise it is completely reasonable that the roommate would have assumed their eventual roommate would also be a woman.", "I disagree (and maybe this is location specific).  But where I live, it would be assumed that, before the lease is signed, the renter would be told if they may have to live in the same bedroom with someone of the opposite sex.  If the landlord didn't inform them, they would be at risk of being given a terrible rating and they might lose renters.", "Eh...based solely on the color of the apartment, yes I can see that.  But, (and maybe this is location specific) the roommate is not at fault for just generally assuming that she wouldn't have to live in the same bedroom as a man.  That's a pretty common assumption to make.  And I think I would put it on OP for not letting the roommate know this before she signed the lease.", "I struggle with that all the time so I get it!", "Oh yeah I got that part and we agree there. I guess the only part of your comment I would disagree on would be that op should share her room which I don't think she should since she's technically the tenant and supposed to be in the single room. \n\nBut seriously the roommate should have a basic say in who she rooms with. She obvs doesn't have the final decision but I think not wanting to room with someone of the opposite sex is completely understandable and op should make it happen.", "Bruh! Yes. Especially reddit! \ud83d\ude02"]}
