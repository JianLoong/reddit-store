The prose will fail for lack of proof.", " Op said that his dad is legally, mentally competent. This doesn't mean he is actually mentally competent, just that his case hasn't been evaluated yet. Everyone is legally mentally competent, until someone starts the medical and legal procedure which will clear up the person's condition. If Op didn't give a f about his dad, then yes, he would be nosy and gold digging, BUT since he cares for his dad, he is gonna be the one who will have to cover for his dad. Not only this, but a good scare is as reality check his brother needs."]}
