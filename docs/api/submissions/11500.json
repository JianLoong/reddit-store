This was just brought to my attention today. I figure maybe he thought with dad being in the hospital it would go unnoticed? Can I provide any additional info?", "Sort of? He has bad memory and gets angry over small things a lot, which are both signs of dementia.

I went to the pd with the bank statements and a screenshot of an uber order today with the last four of the card number. They arrested him based off probable cause, but no bond has been set. that should happen probably monday morning? I am unsure of what he was charged with, just that he was arrested today is all i can confirm.", "The nursing facility is covered by his insurance, he only needs money for incidentals that the facility doesn't provide, like snacks and sodas, the barber that comes on Wednesdays has to be paid by the patient, etc. His insurance provided him 60 days from time of admit, so his stay itself is covered.", "I wonder if the father is mentally competent to understand the consequences to himself of allowing his son to steal from him.", "If it's dad's money he can spend it however he wants.

As someone who didn\u2019t follow up on an abusive ex who was a dr & I didn\u2019t want to ruin his career that reason makes me itch. \nI instinctively feel NTA. They could genuinely kick him out & guilting him to let him keep using it is gross. \nI think a lot of people are vulnerable to elder abuse even with their mental faculties & financial abuse is the most common. My gut also says someone who\u2019d blow $1800 on food on a card stolen from their infirm dad isn\u2019t the kind of guy I want carrying a badge & gun.", "A bad memory isnt necessarily dementia, unless he has been examined by a doctor and has that diagnosis.

You and your aunt noticed something was off and took a closer look. You made the report in good faith. It will be up to the court to determine how things go from here.

Tell them that you or any other person spent 1800 of someone else's dollars on food, but I think its a bad idea, and they'll just go arrest someone and leave them in jail for 2 nights? They won't bother to confirm the account holder didn't make the charges. They won't find out if the account holder approved or wants to prosecute. \n\nI don't even know why the bank would tell someone about all the charges on someone else's bank account. I can't call your bank and say hey tell me everything Fit Menu charged in the past 3 months. Thanks!", "NTA.  In all honesty, it sounds like you need to become your dad's conservator.  If your aunt is someone you can turn to for advice or support or to back you up, do so.  I may be reading this wrong, but it sounds like your dad is on a very fixed income and doesn't have a lot extra.  A loss of $1800 is a lot in that circumstance and your dad can't keep bouncing back from that over and over.   Your brother deserves to be in jail, frankly.  Taking money from an elderly man who's in poor health so you can order in food is despicable!   I feel so bad for you and your dad.  Your brother is not a good person.", "Why?  The brother has been stealing from dad for 10 YEARS!!!  Her dad is old and ill in hospital.  For dad's own good, brother needs to be stopped from doing this.

Bullshit.", "Someone who's been stealing from his father for ten years should not be going into law enforcement.  EVER", "Dear OP.  I've had a parent in care like this, sadly she's gone now, but I understand what you're going through, but was lucky enough not to have a sibling stealing at the same time.  For the dummies downvoting you and grilling you, Medicare and/or Insurance pay for a senior age, very ill person to go into care when they cannot manage their own care/recovery at home alone.  It's sickening what your brother did.  I understand your dad probably doesn't want to get his son in trouble, but you're right to protect his limited income which he'll need to maintain his home so he can return to it after his recovery.  Hang in there.  You did nothing wrong.  It sounds to me that your brother is a liar and thief who doesn't care if he causes your dad to go broke and then will your dad be?", "In the US, felony theft (depending on the state) is typically $1000-$2500, but some states are as low as $500. \n\nOP says brother took a picture of the card he was using while dad was in the hospital, managed to spend in the ball park of $300/week, and never once did dad know or give permission until AFTER it was found out to cover the brother\u2019s ass. Meanwhile OP is having to cover dad\u2019s expenses with their money because of it. \n\nBrother knew exactly what he was doing. It wasn\u2019t \u201cthe wrong card\u201d like he claims. You don\u2019t accidentally spend nearly $2000 on takeout in six weeks when you know you don\u2019t have that kind of money in your account.", "Thats not how crime works.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can't steal money and then get the OK after the fact.", "Really?  Would you want your dad, who's older and ill in care to be down to $13?", "I think you should let your brother be responsible for your fathers situation if he\u2019s so worried about him and his future more than the headache this caused you.", "She's someone who doesn't steal from her ill, elderly parent!", "Most Bank Accounts have statements(and current transactions) available online. Which OP had because they had access to Father's accounts.  So printing them off would have been easy.", "Hello, Maddock, welcome.  Geez.  Are you people nuts?  Do you not understand what happens to older people with no other money than their SS benefits.  Should OP just allow dad to lose his apartment and be homeless when he gets out of the hospital?  WTF.", "The law can't prosecute someone if the person they stole from says 'its all good'.  And dad is saying it's all good. So yeah. No crime. \n\nMorally? Sure. The brother is an asshole. But not a criminal if Dad doesn't want him to be.", "What are you talking about? Who is 'she'?\n\nNo one in this thread is suggesting its okay to steal. Or that what the brother did was okay. \n\nThe point in this comment thread is that this story as presented by OP is missing giant pieces of information because this is not the way the law works. Period. It's just doesn't.", "Then they can clear all of that up with the police, and the brother can continue to syphon dad\u2019s money for his own selfish purposes \ud83d\ude0a. You DID see the part of the post where where the brother only left $13 in dads account, right? Who\u2019s supposed to come up with that money now? OP? \n\nOP was in the right and just looking out for her dad\u2019s finances. Given how he acted, I hope she just wiped her hands of it and let them keep making mistakes.", "No one that you are responding to said this was okay. So why you are arguing about that is strange. \n\nOPs story as told is highly unlikely to be true. Thats all this thread here is saying."]}
