You would be saving your brother,too if he\u2019d start thinking with what\u2019s between his ears instead of his legs", "NTA. She stole food- aka no permission- and sorry this is a consequence of her actions.", "NTA. your brother and his date are ridiculous people", "NTA.  Tell your brother to stop stealing your food.", "Someone ate your leftovers and didn\u2019t like it? Sounds like they fucked around and found out lmao. Definitely NTA", "You're NTA.  Your brother's date ate your food without asking.  Not cool, and she deserved what she got.\n\nEven if you HAD deliberately booby trapped the food, you'd stil be NTA.  It's your food; your brother or his date should ask before helping themselves.", "Your brother is a dick for oh so many reasons. But you, kind sir, are NTA. What kind of asshole eats someone\u2019s leftovers? The thought of germs alone keeps me away from OPF.", "NTA.\n\nhahahaha well I guess she learned a valuable lesson! Don't eat a stranger's leftover without asking !", "NTA. Yeah, don't put hot sauce on your food because at any moment someone you don't know might stand in your kitchen and want to eat your Food.\n\n\nThat person you have never seen before that might show up whenever might be allergic to stuff so maybe you should use your fridge to store nothing but water.\n\n\nFuck that.\n\nI suppose maybe she recognized the container and knew what the food was \"supposed\" to taste like.\n\nBut people putting additional stuff on their take out isn't exactly this barely known, alien and weird custom from the people of absurdistan or whatever.", "NTA. Did this theft of food happen before of after your brother had sex with the rando. No one should bring random overnights to a shared apartment, just not safe for the other people involved. Theft happens.", "NTA\n\nWho goes into someone's frig and eat random leftovers?  EWWWE\n\nHer fault.", "NTA\n\nYou seasoned your food to your liking.  Your food, not anyone else\u2019s.  Why were they taking your food?", "Hahaha NTA and it\u2019s hilarious that this random girl who has no business eating YOUR food is upset with you for how you like to eat YOUR food!", "NTA - \u201cAre you trying to scold me for eating my food the way I like it? Do you hear yourself? Stay out of my food ya fuckin weasel.\u201d \ud83d\ude06", "NTA. You don't go into someone's house and eat their leftovers without asking. She stole your lunch!!", "\"Who the hell are you and why are you eating my food?\"  NTA", "Oh boo hoo, poor her. She ate your food without your permission and suffered the consequences. I guess it\u2019s a good thing your brother is an f-boi because she\u2019d make a nightmare in law \ud83d\ude2d NTA.", "Nta, she is a guest in your home. That doesn't allow her the right to eat whatever she pleases. She's very entitled", "Brother is a raging AH. ...and apparently attracts the same.", "Brothers date is the AH. I\u2019d be pissed if someone ate my leftovers. \n\nBro is only pissed because he didn\u2019t end the night the way he wanted.", "The way i look at it is like this.\n\nWho in the fuck is this random hook up to think it\u2019s okay to dig around for food in someone\u2019s apartment, see Thai food of all things then complain when it\u2019s hot because they cannot handle spicy\u2026.but again, decided to eat the Thai food.", "NTA\n\nIf you enjoy that level of heat, you spice your leftovers WHICH YOU BOUGHT to your own enjoyment/tolerance level. The random chose to steal food, she can deal with the consequences.", "NTA, Tell his tinder date her times up", "NTA, your food to store and prepare as you like. Only way for you to be at fault is if you offered it to them, which obviously didn't happen.", "NTA she came into your home and stole. Thieving thing can deal with the burn.", "NTA.  It's your food, make it the way you like!", "So your brother is bringing home total strangers who steal (just food, *for now*), and the problem he had here is that his hookup's theft backfired??", "NTA\n\nThis is not your problem at all.  She shouldn't be eating someone else's food.", "Well, at least he got screwed. Kinda. \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 \ud83c\udf5b", "Hahahah! Actions have consequences!\n\nNot your food? Ask before eating. Can\u2019t ask? Don\u2019t eat it. \n\nAnyway, NTA.", "Especially leftovers?\n\nI mean, if you are going to rudely raid a stranger's fridge, grab a piece of fruit or a carton of yogurt. Something where you aren't guessing what it is?\n\nBrother is just mad because his date being an asshat ruined sexy fun times, and pointing the asshattery to said date will definitely preclude future sexy fun times, so he's going the path of least resistance and blaming you.\n\nNTA, OP. Keep spicing those leftovers.", "Plus, you would have no idea how long that food was in the fridge.  With Thai usually being spicy, you might not be able to smell or taste if it was a little off.  It's a good way to get food poisoning.", "She accused him of booby trapping the food because it has happened before.  She is in the habit of sponging on others.  \n\nSex increases appetite.  Everybody knows that.  Insist your brother have good ready for his dates in the future.  Another option is to buy a second fridge with a lock.", "This x a million. She\u2019s lucky she didn\u2019t up IN the refrigerator.", "Also he needs to keep a much closer eye on visitors. Why on earth was he randomly letting her wander the house? He should have to pay for the food for sure and also needs to understand that he\u2019s liable for whatever anything his dates do while they visit. They are his responsibility 100% and if he\u2019s not careful your house will be robbed.", "Brother probably has some ...frustrations that he is taking out on OP. \n\nHow entitled does someone have to be to walk in to your date's place for the first time and take food without asking?", "Randos also can steal stuff.", "And/or freezer \ud83d\ude33", "That's the risk we take! \ud83d\ude02", "u/Sukdx is a bot.", "Really good olive oil you drink like a shot, it's amazing. It should taste a little grassy and leave a little burn on the back of the throat.

And \u201cproviding\u201d doesn\u2019t mean taking someone else\u2019s food. \n\n**PSA to Tinderella: don\u2019t eat random shit from a stranger\u2019s fridge.**\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nShe decided to eat food that had someone other than her date's mouth germs on it.

I am laughing so hard.\n\nI'm the spicy eater in my family. Nobody would ever dare touching my food.\n\nYour brother probably knows you like the feeling of a little bit of heat. He could've warned almost-funtime about it. Bet he didn't even think someone would be so stupid to just eat some Thai Food from the fridge.\n\nI bet he told her \"yeah help yourself Babe\" and now he's totally to blame, and he knows it. Also she must be really good in bed, otherwise people that stupid would be out of the gene pool.", "She fucked around and found out. \n\nI hope she screams again in pain when she's having a spicy poo.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nIt's your food, on what planet does this girl lives to believe you cannot do what you want with your own food?

Your own food ffs!  \n\nAs soon as I read she tried 'oat milk' for the burn I laughed, yeah...that's not going to work lol", "I learned this lesson when living at my first apartment in college\u2026 I came home (drunk) 3AM and was making a salad\u2026 saw my roommates peppers in the fridge and thought cutting one(of the 15, they were tiny) up and adding it to my salad would be nice\u2026 they were ghost peppers(or something of the sort) Before even eating one my hands, face, arms, eyes red swollen burning.

NTA OP!", "NTA. Bet she never, ever does it again.....insert evil laugh.....", "NTA. Also, tell your brother that this heavy reaction to hot spices might be sign of chlamydia, he should check that with his doc.\n\n(of course, I made that up, but ffs, your brother is just  AH who blames you for not getting laid with some random who steals food! Let him pay)", "He brought home a tinder date after dinner but the food incident didn't happen till midnight?  I assume he thinks you screwed him over for round two, huh?  Keep spicing your food.  That was hilarious!  NTA.  What kind of asshole eats food out of a stranger's fridge?", "NTA. Your food and thats how you like it. \n\nWhat the heck are people's issues?! If it is not yours, dont touch it!!!!", "Perhaps little bro should take these gals out for dinner first so they won't raid the fridge.  And if she is willing to be rude enough to steal food, what else could her sticky fingers picked up and taken with her.    \n\n   Hooking up with random people & bringing them home can get a person robbed.", ">but my brother says that I should not have spiced my own leftovers\n\nGee, it's ALMOST like it's your food and you can do whatever you want with it. Also, what would the excuse be if you'd just ordered something that was naturally spicy?", "How dare you add things to YOUR god that YOU paid for! NTA.", "Wow. Definitely NTA.", " NTA.", "NTA - and probably my favorite one I have read in a while.  As in you actually had me giggling out loud.  \n\nNaw, she effed around with someone else's food that she was NOT entitled to and found out.  I mean, who DOES that?!  \n\nAlso, it wasn't like you were being malicious and trying to screw with someone else on purpose.  You did this with the full intent of eating it at that spice level later on.  This situation gets sticky if you over spiced it to \"catch\" or \"teach a lesson\" to a food thief but that is clearly not the case.  \n\nThanks for the laugh today.", "At no time in my life have I ever helped myself to someone else's food without their permission.  The audacity of that bitch!  NTA.", "If you had done this to punish someone I'd think you were the AH but if you legit like it spicy then obviously NTA.

She ate (and ruined) your food. That's on Bro.", "NTA - it wasn't for her and it wasn't \"booby trapped\".

You rightfully expected that only you would be eating the leftovers.", "Yta for even posing this question on this sub\n\nSomeone stole my food, am I an asshole? How? Like how could you be?", "Right?
