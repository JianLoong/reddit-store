You did not \"booby trap\" anything, you made YOUR food hot. If your brother would've taken care of his date and not just gave her your leftovers, none of that would've happened.

You didn\u2019t add hot sauce with the specific intention of torching someone else's mouth, how are you supposed to know in advance that your brother's going to bring some girl over & let her steal your food?
