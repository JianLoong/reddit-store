Wow, that\u2019s a nasty, manipulative thing to do.  Struggling with depression isn\u2019t a choice.

No one can save you or fix you!\n\nOnly you can do that!\n\nPlus this toxic view that you will see someone \u201cworse off\u201d and *snap out of it* is soooo incorrect! You need help, medical professionals, meds, therapy or to figure out what works for you. \n\nPart of it is choosing to get past depression. Sure. But that part may come after a bunch of medical interventions, not because you saw someone worse off.", "NTA - She crossed a line.\n\nShe some how thinks taking you to see another depressed person who isn't doing too well will somehow make you want to deal with your mental health, something she knows little about. Not only that she is using that other person as a pawn by sharing their mental health issues and lifestyle with you. That's disgusting in my opinion. People aren't toys that can be played with and their mental health isn't some sort of teaching tool to use against them or you.... That other person is a victim of this too because it's unlikely they agreed to this. \n\nYour parents need to be told to stop talking about you to other people and if this were me I'd tell them if they didn't stop I would go NC permanently.", "That's some evil, manipulative behavior.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA, she knows *nothing* about depression and how to treat it and was so far out of line in doing this and can't even see the line any more.

It reads like you do fine on your own, if so that's great.  Your family needs to learn/realize that the \"fixing', if even needed, has to start with you, not with some misguided trap.\r  \n\n\nGood luck to you, you don't owe anyone an apology, I can see a few being owed to you, your familyas much as the \"frined\".", "NTA.

I'm assuming she's not mental health professional.", "NTA block her number and put your family on an information diet. This is horribly manipulative by all involved and not in your best interest. This is only rooted in her desire to \"white knight you.\" Ie make herself feel special and better then you. Your family enabling this is not ok.", "NTA. This is tone deaf, and in my opinion,  unforgivable. I'm so sorry you experienced this.", "NTA\nSorry but you have depression, it's not like you can just turn if off because it's inconvenient. What ah move on her and your family's behalf. That's bloody unreasonable. You may well have to hide your condition from your family now to prevent further issues like this, which, of course not healthy and is removing a support system. But I think that might be the best option moving forward. I know it's hard for a family to watch somebody suffer when they can't do anything about it, but the person dealing with the depression should surely come first.", "You can tell her that it is no wonder her relative is still depressed with the kind of attitude she has. I'll bet she is also one of those people who do not believe that depression is an illness and she thinks that medication is not needed. \n\nNTA. You escaped a very unpleasant time. As for your family, start telling them that any illness they have is all their fault and they only have to sort it out, and then ask how it sounds when you are on the receivership of this kind of cruelty.", "It was not a good gesture. It was manipulative, deceitful and cruel. And undoubtedly counterproductive. How cruel to her own depressed relative as well. \"Look, I've brought OP to look at you to show her how bad people can get.\" All in front of your child. The woman is an oaf. NTA.", "NTA\n\nSounds like she almost think depression is a choice?? \"If you dont sort yourself out this is how you'll end up\". She knows nothing of what you're going through and how you're handling it. Does she think you just sit around like \"im depressed. Not gonna do anything about it\" ??\n\nThats incredibly weird and disrespectful to say, especially since your mental health isnt something you've discussed with her at all.\n\nYour parents crossed a serious boundary telling her that. Im so sorry they're siding with her.", "NTA she was very manipulative pushy and disrespectful of your boundaries. If you wanted her help you would have asked for it.

This whole thing is so terrible I genuinely don't even know where to start or end. \n\nNTA", "Jeez, you are so NTA. I have major depression and PTSD. It is my choice as to whether I share these things with others or not. It is your right to limit the information you give to your parents and others. It is not the parents right or their friends right to publicly shame you or even to privately shame you. Unfortunately in the time period I grew up mental health wasn't really talked about and it was thought that depression was just a \"pull yourself up by your own bootstraps\" kind of thing. Do not be ashamed as to how long it takes you to recover from such a major disorder.", "NAH. \"Tough love\" doesn't really work with depression and can risk making the person feel more of a burden and withdrawn even more. Lisa is pretty manipulative and was happy to use your son as a weapon in all this. I'd consider limiting her access to him as risk of her drip-feeding things like if your mother loved you more, she'd get better. Doesn't work that way. \n\nAlso Lisa has written off their depressed relative as being of no more worth than as a case study to be used to shock others back to the right path. Why doesn't she care about that person? And if she does care, well her methods haven't worked there. So why with you?", "NTA. I can understand Lisa wanting to help you, but manipulating you like that was not okay at all. \n\nIf she actually did what she told you, the fun meeting with her family and kids around, that would have been an nice thing and would have helped you, too. Having fun is a good thing when you are depressed. \n\nShowing you a depressed relative is not.

Gosh, can't imagine why you're depressed growing up in a family like that. \ud83d\ude44 With friends like her and family like them, who needs enemies?\n\nLow contact with them, no contact with her highly recommended based on personal experience. I don't know your circumstances but if this is viable, you might be surprised how much it helps to get negative influences out of your life.", "It was a nice gesture to tell you that you have depression because you aren't trying hard enough? And trying to \"scare you sober\" like you're a heroin addict? While putting one of her relatives on display like a zoo attraction? Am I reading this correctly?\n\nNTA, OP. Everyone except you, your kid, and the depressed relative are all major A H.", "NTA \n\nYour family is though for telling anyone your personal business without permission.", "NTA. If she really wanted to help, she should have talked to you about it asking if you\u2019d like to meet someone she thinks can help you by, I don\u2019t know, not wanting to end up like them?!\nNot only does she owe you an apology, your family does too coz outing your mental health like that to a friend isn\u2019t ok. Unless that friend is (as close as) family, to you in particular and they were just seeking advice in how to help you by talking to them about you. \nAlso, using your son to get you there! Wow!!", "NTA. Her thought process was to shame you and out you to others as a way to \"shock\" the depression out of you? Wow what a novel way of dealing with a health crisis. Wonder if it will work on someone with cancer or MS or asthma.\n\nI'd cut ties or at least go low contact.", "NTA.  Block her and your family.  You do not owe anyone an apology.", "NTA.  You handled the situation the best you could, a situation you shouldn't have been put in.  But it sounds like you need to put your family on an \"information diet\".  Clearly they are gossiping about you, and in a highly negative manner.  They may have even exaggerated things to Lisa.  Lisa's still TA because it wasn't her place to intervene, and she did it in the worst way possible, but I also wonder what she was told by OP's parents.  OP's parents are also TA in this situation.", "If you have struggled with mental health issues your entire life, why did you choose to have a kid? If it is so bad that people are trying to save you, don't you owe it to your kid to try to deal with the situation? If he inherits your depression, maybe he will deal with it better if you have shown him how.\n\nWhat she did was not nice, but doing nothing is not nice either", "NTA. Firstly, depression is different for everyone, the symptoms and experiences will vary. Depression also isn't something you can just \"sort out\", I hate people treating those who are depressed like as if it's just because they're not trying hard enough, so gross.", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry your family is wrong and they won't properly support you", "As someone who has dealt with depression since early childhood, I am so angry for you.
