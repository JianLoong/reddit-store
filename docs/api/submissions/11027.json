Wow, that\u2019s a nasty, manipulative thing to do.  Struggling with depression isn\u2019t a choice.

Not only that she is using that other person as a pawn by sharing their mental health issues and lifestyle with you. That's disgusting in my opinion. People aren't toys that can be played with and their mental health isn't some sort of teaching tool to use against them or you.... That other person is a victim of this too because it's unlikely they agreed to this. \n\nYour parents need to be told to stop talking about you to other people and if this were me I'd tell them if they didn't stop I would go NC permanently.", "That's some evil, manipulative behavior.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA, she knows *nothing* about depression and how to treat it and was so far out of line in doing this and can't even see the line any more.

I'm assuming she's not mental health professional.", "NTA block her number and put your family on an information diet. This is horribly manipulative by all involved and not in your best interest.

You may well have to hide your condition from your family now to prevent further issues like this, which, of course not healthy and is removing a support system.

I'll bet she is also one of those people who do not believe that depression is an illness and she thinks that medication is not needed. \n\nNTA. You escaped a very unpleasant time. As for your family, start telling them that any illness they have is all their fault and they only have to sort it out, and then ask how it sounds when you are on the receivership of this kind of cruelty.", "It was not a good gesture. It was manipulative, deceitful and cruel. And undoubtedly counterproductive.

Not gonna do anything about it\" ??\n\nThats incredibly weird and disrespectful to say, especially since your mental health isnt something you've discussed with her at all.\n\nYour parents crossed a serious boundary telling her that. Im so sorry they're siding with her.", "NTA she was very manipulative pushy and disrespectful of your boundaries. If you wanted her help you would have asked for it.

It is my choice as to whether I share these things with others or not. It is your right to limit the information you give to your parents and others. It is not the parents right or their friends right to publicly shame you or even to privately shame you. Unfortunately in the time period I grew up mental health wasn't really talked about and it was thought that depression was just a \"pull yourself up by your own bootstraps\" kind of thing. Do not be ashamed as to how long it takes you to recover from such a major disorder.", "NAH. \"Tough love\" doesn't really work with depression and can risk making the person feel more of a burden and withdrawn even more. Lisa is pretty manipulative and was happy to use your son as a weapon in all this. I'd consider limiting her access to him as risk of her drip-feeding things like if your mother loved you more, she'd get better. Doesn't work that way. \n\nAlso Lisa has written off their depressed relative as being of no more worth than as a case study to be used to shock others back to the right path. Why doesn't she care about that person? And if she does care, well her methods haven't worked there. So why with you?", "NTA. I can understand Lisa wanting to help you, but manipulating you like that was not okay at all. \n\nIf she actually did what she told you, the fun meeting with her family and kids around, that would have been an nice thing and would have helped you, too.

You handled the situation the best you could, a situation you shouldn't have been put in.  But it sounds like you need to put your family on an \"information diet\".  Clearly they are gossiping about you, and in a highly negative manner.  They may have even exaggerated things to Lisa.  Lisa's still TA because it wasn't her place to intervene, and she did it in the worst way possible, but I also wonder what she was told by OP's parents.  OP's parents are also TA in this situation.", "If you have struggled with mental health issues your entire life, why did you choose to have a kid? If it is so bad that people are trying to save you, don't you owe it to your kid to try to deal with the situation?

Firstly, depression is different for everyone, the symptoms and experiences will vary.

I have a hard time understanding why someone would do this and why your family would support her view.  The fact is that she lied about the reason for the visit, and was incredibly intrusive, not to mention that she's portraying a family member in a bad light.  Also, if she's not a therapist, which I would guess she isn't, she should stay out of it.\n\nI've suffered from depression for most of my life (finally under control with meds for brain chemical shortage and 10 years of therapy), and I would suggest you stay away from these toxic people for a while.  Depression is hard enough, you don't need people making it worse.  Yes, this friend and your family are burdening you with their crap on top of your depression.  Good luck.", "NTA. That\u2019s your private business. Your parents are the AH for telling the friend your personal business.", "NTA that is so incredibly rude and presumptuous. You did nothing wrong. She doesn't need to save you. \n\nCan you block her? And maybe take a break from your family who honestly don't seem very helpful and might be exacerbating your situation", "NTA, how horrible for that woman to do that to you.  How nasty of your family to side with her.  I hope you get to have a trip sometime that is actually pleasant and restful.", "She set a trap and felt angry that you felt trapped, and avoid it?\n\nNTA", "It sounds like your family is a big reason for your supposedly deteriorating mental health. Tell them if they don't stop such intrusive and unwanted things to \"help\" you you'll have to reduce contact for the sake of your mental health", "NTA.  How very rude and ignorant of this woman. Tell your family your private business is not to be shared with random people. How dare your family think you owe anyone an apology.  No contact. Especially with that woman.", "NTA.  And besides that she tricked/lied to your child too?  She needs therapy more than you do.", "NTA. Time to block her forever and your family for a while.", "NTA.  Mental health is private & none of anyone's business unless YOU make it their business, & in this case you haven't.  She is a very manipulative person & it sounds like she didn't do this alone.  It sounds like maybe your parents knew about it too.", "NTA, and I hope you can go low/no contact with this person. This seems like a very draining person who\u2019ll only make you worse off", "NTA", "INFO\n\n> A couple of weeks ago she asked me to come along with her to an out of town trip to meet her family. \n\nI'm sorry, can we talk about this for a little?\n\nWhat even *is* this? \n\nI can't even wrap my head around \"hanging out with *my parents' friend*.\" Let alone \"come meet my family?\"\n\nNot to put too fine a point on it but... *why the hell* were you interested in this *in the first place*?", "NTA\n\nShe and your family are crazy ignorant.", "NTA at all.  This is just heartbreaking.  You definitely do not owe anyone an apology.  They owe you one but you might just want to cut them off.  This supposed friend is not a friend at all.", "NTA and her and your family are wrong.  Do not let them make you spiral further into a depressive state.  Are you going to therapy or on meds?  If not, consult with a mental health expert, not a family friend.  Going NC with your fam right now is a good solution until you figure out your own path forward.  Best wishes.", "Have you tried, I don't know, *not* being depressed? (/s obviously)\n\nNTA without question. What a cruel gesture to both out your mental health struggles but also use her relative like a circus display. I'm speechless. This could have been something really helpful and great for you and your child, but shevhad to go and ruin it. She's got a white knight complex, and owes you an apology.", "NTA, that was very intrusive of her. The \u201cjust trying to help\u201d kind of people can be incredibly toxic because they often refuse to accept the truth when their \u201chelp\u201d is actually harmful. \n\nMy aunt was like that about weight loss. Had to cut her off and block her to get her to stop sending links about LCHF and the evils of sugar. Didn\u2019t matter how many times I told her no thanks, whenever I posted anything on social media even remotely connected to weight, health, food, diet, self esteem, etc, etc, she\u2019d start sending stuff again. What made me snap was when I had a mental breakdown for unrelated reasons she knew nothing about and she decided that that was the perfect time to inform me that the breakdown was caused by me eating sugar\u2026 I wrote her a very angry message about how much she had hurt me with that over the years and her response was of course \u201cI\u2019m just trying to help\u201d", "NTA. Wow, I'm sorry your family is so clueless. That was indeed manipulative, completely ignorant of what depression is. Good for you for going back home. This is incredibly disrespectful of you but also of the other person.", "NTA every decision she made was just awful, and likely to make herself feel important rather than actually helping you (or the family member she was going to point as \"you don't want to be them\", which is just terrible.   There are so many ways she could actually help you, like actually inviting you to fun stuff, offering to watch your kid so you get a break, etc, and instead she chose..this.\n\nDo not apologize to her, and definitely put your family on an info diet.  I hope you can find some support elsewhere.  I too am very private, it's hard to open up and trust people with stuff like this, and to have your own family betray your trust is just so painful.", "NTA.\n\nReal life is not the movies. They bring juvi hall kids to prisons all the time, and you know what most of those kids end up doing? Being alumni of those prisons. That manipulative shit doesn't work.", "NTA\nShe owes you a sincere apology, not the other way around. Good luck.", "NTA, and ew. \n\nEven if we put aside 'outing' your mental health, and the extremely disgusting view that you are choosing to not 'sort out' your depression, it's extremely concerning and gross that she is doing this performative pity party. There was no benefit this for you, or your kid. This was purely her trying to feel good about herself, so that she can turn around to your family and be like 'see, I tried to help her and she wouldn't let me, I'm so gracious even to ungrateful people.\"", "NTA- You're managing your mental health just fine. Toxic positivity is a hard thing to deal with and it sounds like your whole family and your friend is doing just that. If she was so worried about your mental health, then she wouldn't be doing that. Toxic positivity can actually make you feel worse and struggle even more with your depression. And you're right it's not up to her to 'save you' as you don't need saving. And as for the friends family member that she wanted you to see, perhaps that person's depression  wouldn't be so bad if they had a supportive and caring family.", "> She's basically implying you are staying depressed on purpose\n\nThis is exactly it. \"Hey sort out that depression or you'll end up miserable.\" Gee thanks lady, I hadn't thought of that.\n\n /r/thanksimcured", "This was my thought that maybe it's so bad it's affecting her child.  We don't know the whole story of course.  Yes the family friend was a dick to do that but something is definitely wrong if the whole family and friends are worried.  Feel bad for the kid.", "[The ones who walk away from Omelas](https://shsdavisapes.pbworks.com/f/Omelas.pdf), by Ursula LeGuin", "Oh my god it does", "She couldn't save the relative because she didn't know another person with depression. That's the only way this can be done so that relative is just a lost cause I guess but can still be useful for OP's little savior friend.", "Well first you start by humilliating the person you want to help.\n\nThen you break them so you can rebuild them. Obviously it's not doable if the relatives of Lisa are OP's future as they are too old to be easily breakable.\n\nDon't forget to use and abuse your victim while rebuilding them so they know that they will alays owe you.", "Oh, for sure. It's not only her excuse for the relative's current condition, but it's also her justification for further traumatizing that relative by dragging an unsuspecting OP to their doorstep as part of The Depression Tour of 2023. OP has nothing to apologize about and definitely is NTA in this situation, her family's friend is."]}
