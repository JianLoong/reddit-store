I also don\u2019t know how to type well so forgive me. \n\nI (28f) have a family friend \u201cLisa\u201d (42f), she\u2019s been in the family for years and is a friend of my parents. It is very well known that I struggle with depression and always have and it\u2019s also worth noting that I am a very private person.\n\nA couple of weeks ago she asked me to come along with her to an out of town trip to meet her family. She wanted me to bring my son (7) along and said it was just a chance to give me a bit of a break from life. She asked me to bring my son because there would be kids around and thought it would be good for him to make some friends. I thought it was really sweet. \n\nJust before arriving she told me the real reason she invited me was because she has a depressed relative and wanted to show me what my future was going to look like if I didn\u2019t \u201csort out\u201d my depression. \n\nI felt sick and told her this was extremely manipulative and I drove home after we exchanged some words. I haven\u2019t spoken to her since. She\u2019s been texting me saying I owe her an apology and that I\u2019m going to end up like her relative if I don\u2019t let her help me. \n\nI just think it\u2019s not her responsibility to save me, I didn\u2019t ask for it and I have been perfectly capable of handling my own mental health. \n\nMy family have all sided with her and have said it was a good gesture and I\u2019m an asshole for not hearing her out. I feel sick to my stomach. I haven\u2019t even told her about my mental health so she took it upon herself to run with the information she had got from my parents and bombard me. It has made me want to stop sharing all together. I\u2019m not speaking with my family atm either because they think I should apologise. \n\nAita?", "created_utc": 1677479619, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11d4w0k/aita_for_telling_a_family_friend_to_stop_trying/", "score": 223, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was going to \u201cout\u201d your mental health issues to everyone in her family with your son there.   \n\n\nYou don\u2019t owe her an apology. She owes you one.", "NTA. Of course you are angry. She's basically implying you are staying depressed on purpose, out of some defect of character, which is incredibly ableist and inaccurate. Depression is a biological illness of the brain. It's not your fault that you have depression, and you are doing the best you can. She was way out of line.\n\nI hate when people display their ableist bigotry and then have the audacity to claim they're \"just trying to help.\" No, she wasn't.", "NTA.  Wow, that\u2019s a nasty, manipulative thing to do.  Struggling with depression isn\u2019t a choice.  A lot of the things you can do to manage it (medication, therapy, diet, exercise, making self-care and health routines, etc) are choices, but I\u2019m gonna bet that you\u2019re doing your best with those things.\n\nYour family owes you an apology for outing you like that, and for supporting such an unhelpful, unkind \u201cintervention.\u201d", "NTA I think you went about it the exact right way. I would feel really betrayed by my family for sharing something so private. I also think they all clearly have a problematic view on depression. They are all treating it like a choice, when it is absolutely far from that. If we could all just choose to be happy and not depressed, we would. I\u2019m pretty horrified for you to be honest. I\u2019m sorry you had to experience that.", "NTA- that is so weirdly controlling of her. \nShe's treating you like an irresponsible child, she lied to you to stage a bizarre intervention like meeting?\nI would block her from anything to do with your life tbh. She sounds unhinged.", "NTA. That's effed up and they all owe you an apology.\n\nIf depression could be cured by just meeting another, more depressed person, we'd all be sublimely happy and only one poor dude somewhere would be miserable. It's absolute nonsense.", "NTA. Her \u201cgesture\u201d might have come from a good place at first but the fact that she kept pushing it was very wrong of her", "NTA. That's really weird on her part. \"You're depressed so I'm going to help by letting you meet someone that's even more depressed \". No wonder you don't want to go. Imagine what conversations she'd have with your child.", "NTA. \n\nYou are totally correct. No one can save you or fix you!\n\nOnly you can do that!\n\nPlus this toxic view that you will see someone \u201cworse off\u201d and *snap out of it* is soooo incorrect! You need help, medical professionals, meds, therapy or to figure out what works for you. \n\nPart of it is choosing to get past depression. Sure. But that part may come after a bunch of medical interventions, not because you saw someone worse off.", "NTA - She crossed a line.\n\nShe some how thinks taking you to see another depressed person who isn't doing too well will somehow make you want to deal with your mental health, something she knows little about. Not only that she is using that other person as a pawn by sharing their mental health issues and lifestyle with you. That's disgusting in my opinion. People aren't toys that can be played with and their mental health isn't some sort of teaching tool to use against them or you.... That other person is a victim of this too because it's unlikely they agreed to this. \n\nYour parents need to be told to stop talking about you to other people and if this were me I'd tell them if they didn't stop I would go NC permanently.", "That's some evil, manipulative behavior.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA, she knows *nothing* about depression and how to treat it and was so far out of line in doing this and can't even see the line any more. This was outrageous.", "NTA.\r  \n\n\nI've found that it is the very rare person who can understand depression without actually haven't gone through it, either as a one time thing or a lifetime thing.\r  \n\n\nWhat she did to you is first off way out of line, and second would be of absolutely no help at all, either to you or to the person she was going to bring you to, it would be sort of interesting to know if that person had any idea of what was coming.\r  \n\n\nI fervently hope that you come to peace with yourself, and if you think you need help that you can reach out on your own terms.  It reads like you do fine on your own, if so that's great.  Your family needs to learn/realize that the \"fixing', if even needed, has to start with you, not with some misguided trap.\r  \n\n\nGood luck to you, you don't owe anyone an apology, I can see a few being owed to you, your familyas much as the \"frined\".", "NTA. She lied to you. She's manipulative. She doesn't understand depression. She has an extremely inflated sense of her own self-importance. You don't need her anywhere near you.", "NTA. She\u2019s way out of line and making a lot of assumptions, your parents are also TA for telling her anything, your personal life is not there\u2019s to share.", "NTA and she is a full blown asshole. That was extremely manipulative on her part and you don't owe her any apologies.", "NTA. She manipulated in to going with her and then tried to manipulate you again by saying you\u2019re gonna end up like her relative.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Get the help YOU want to when you feel ready, and for your sons sake. (Hopefully sooner than later before it becomes too comfortable to give up and stay in this mode of daily living) Reach out to those you feel whos methods you can trust. Not this manipulator.", "NTA, WT-ABSOLUTE-F!!!! She crossed the line. How dare she, uuggghhhh, I'm outraged on your behalf. I'm assuming she's not mental health professional.", "NTA block her number and put your family on an information diet. This is horribly manipulative by all involved and not in your best interest. This is only rooted in her desire to \"white knight you.\" Ie make herself feel special and better then you. Your family enabling this is not ok.", "NTA. This is tone deaf, and in my opinion,  unforgivable. I'm so sorry you experienced this.", "NTA\nSorry but you have depression, it's not like you can just turn if off because it's inconvenient. What ah move on her and your family's behalf. That's bloody unreasonable. You may well have to hide your condition from your family now to prevent further issues like this, which, of course not healthy and is removing a support system. But I think that might be the best option moving forward. I know it's hard for a family to watch somebody suffer when they can't do anything about it, but the person dealing with the depression should surely come first.", "You can tell her that it is no wonder her relative is still depressed with the kind of attitude she has. I'll bet she is also one of those people who do not believe that depression is an illness and she thinks that medication is not needed. \n\nNTA. You escaped a very unpleasant time. As for your family, start telling them that any illness they have is all their fault and they only have to sort it out, and then ask how it sounds when you are on the receivership of this kind of cruelty.", "It was not a good gesture. It was manipulative, deceitful and cruel. And undoubtedly counterproductive. How cruel to her own depressed relative as well. \"Look, I've brought OP to look at you to show her how bad people can get.\" All in front of your child. The woman is an oaf. NTA.", "NTA\n\nSounds like she almost think depression is a choice?? \"If you dont sort yourself out this is how you'll end up\". She knows nothing of what you're going through and how you're handling it. Does she think you just sit around like \"im depressed. Not gonna do anything about it\" ??\n\nThats incredibly weird and disrespectful to say, especially since your mental health isnt something you've discussed with her at all.\n\nYour parents crossed a serious boundary telling her that. Im so sorry they're siding with her.", "NTA she was very manipulative pushy and disrespectful of your boundaries. If you wanted her help you would have asked for it. And demanding an apology from you is way out of libe when she's the AH here.", "Invite her out to lunch to \"apologize\" then swing by a really shitty nursing home and tell her this is where she's going to end up if she doesn't start treating people with respect. NTA.", "Come on girl. Fix that depression, chop chop, what are you waiting for???\nIf only it was that easy hey?? Some people don't understand mental illness, but you are Def not the ah. Your family friend needs to fix her mindset, but that's not your responsibility. You just try your best to keep you and your child happy,no need to go anywhere that makes you uncomfortable, depressed or not!!", "Absolutely NTA.  I dealt with depression for 20+ years as well as very toxic family who didn\u2019t think it was real.  You owe no one an apology.", "NTA. That\u2019s literally the opposite of a way to help someone with depression.", ">Just before arriving she told me the real reason she invited me was because she has a depressed relative and wanted to show me what my future was going to look like if I didn\u2019t \u201csort out\u201d my depression.\n\nWhat the actual fuck\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She\u2019s been texting me saying I owe her an apology and that I\u2019m going to end up like her relative if I don\u2019t let her help me.\n\nThis is so far away from actual help it might as well be in a different solar system\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>I haven\u2019t even told her about my mental health so she took it upon herself to run with the information she had got from my parents and bombard me. It has made me want to stop sharing all together. \n\nA perfectly normal reaction to a disgusting break of your trust. Her little intervention also had zero chance of making your depression better, in fact it had a high likelihood of making it worse. This whole thing is so terrible I genuinely don't even know where to start or end. \n\nNTA", "Jeez, you are so NTA. I have major depression and PTSD. It is my choice as to whether I share these things with others or not. It is your right to limit the information you give to your parents and others. It is not the parents right or their friends right to publicly shame you or even to privately shame you. Unfortunately in the time period I grew up mental health wasn't really talked about and it was thought that depression was just a \"pull yourself up by your own bootstraps\" kind of thing. Do not be ashamed as to how long it takes you to recover from such a major disorder.", "NAH. \"Tough love\" doesn't really work with depression and can risk making the person feel more of a burden and withdrawn even more. Lisa is pretty manipulative and was happy to use your son as a weapon in all this. I'd consider limiting her access to him as risk of her drip-feeding things like if your mother loved you more, she'd get better. Doesn't work that way. \n\nAlso Lisa has written off their depressed relative as being of no more worth than as a case study to be used to shock others back to the right path. Why doesn't she care about that person? And if she does care, well her methods haven't worked there. So why with you?", "NTA. I can understand Lisa wanting to help you, but manipulating you like that was not okay at all. \n\nIf she actually did what she told you, the fun meeting with her family and kids around, that would have been an nice thing and would have helped you, too. Having fun is a good thing when you are depressed. \n\nShowing you a depressed relative is not. I think yo are old enough to know all about depression and what it can lead to and don't need someone to explain it to you.", "Not just that, but simultaneously shame one of her own family members.\nOP is NTA.", "So right, I\u2019m betting that the relative didn\u2019t volunteer to be a \u201cdire warning\u201d for a stranger.", "Also how she can save her? Why she didn't save her relative?"]}
