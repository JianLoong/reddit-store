I also don\u2019t know how to type well so forgive me. \n\nI (28f) have a family friend \u201cLisa\u201d (42f), she\u2019s been in the family for years and is a friend of my parents. It is very well known that I struggle with depression and always have and it\u2019s also worth noting that I am a very private person.\n\nA couple of weeks ago she asked me to come along with her to an out of town trip to meet her family. She wanted me to bring my son (7) along and said it was just a chance to give me a bit of a break from life. She asked me to bring my son because there would be kids around and thought it would be good for him to make some friends. I thought it was really sweet. \n\nJust before arriving she told me the real reason she invited me was because she has a depressed relative and wanted to show me what my future was going to look like if I didn\u2019t \u201csort out\u201d my depression. \n\nI felt sick and told her this was extremely manipulative and I drove home after we exchanged some words. I haven\u2019t spoken to her since. She\u2019s been texting me saying I owe her an apology and that I\u2019m going to end up like her relative if I don\u2019t let her help me. \n\nI just think it\u2019s not her responsibility to save me, I didn\u2019t ask for it and I have been perfectly capable of handling my own mental health. \n\nMy family have all sided with her and have said it was a good gesture and I\u2019m an asshole for not hearing her out. I feel sick to my stomach. I haven\u2019t even told her about my mental health so she took it upon herself to run with the information she had got from my parents and bombard me. It has made me want to stop sharing all together. I\u2019m not speaking with my family atm either because they think I should apologise. \n\nAita?\n\nEdit: I have seen a lot of comments suggesting I have given my family a reason to be worried. I wanted to clarify that I haven\u2019t. I generally keep to myself and don\u2019t include them much in what I go through because a lot of them don\u2019t believe in depression/therapy/medications etc. They acknowledge I have some struggles but they attribute it more to just being sad and they know that I have struggled always but it is a lifelong struggle, I am doing the best I can and have been figuring out different ways to cope through many different treatments for years, I hate that this is my life and I absolutely do not want to be this way. They know only what I have told them and I will say a lot of the time I have only explained my depression to them because they have told me it\u2019s inconveniencing them. I don\u2019t know exactly what they told Lisa but I\u2019m assuming it was bad enough to warrant this.\n\nEdit 2: sorry I just wanted to add that I was worried about being the AH because over the years my family have guilt tripped me about being this way and I also have anxiety so I worry if I\u2019ve overstepped or if I\u2019m seeing things wrong.

You need help, medical professionals, meds, therapy or to figure out what works for you. \n\nPart of it is choosing to get past depression. Sure.

Not only that she is using that other person as a pawn by sharing their mental health issues and lifestyle with you. That's disgusting in my opinion. People aren't toys that can be played with and their mental health isn't some sort of teaching tool to use against them or you.... That other person is a victim of this too because it's unlikely they agreed to this. \n\nYour parents need to be told to stop talking about you to other people and if this were me I'd tell them if they didn't stop I would go NC permanently.", "That's some evil, manipulative behavior.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA, she knows *nothing* about depression and how to treat it and was so far out of line in doing this and can't even see the line any more.

NTA.", "NTA stop sharing information with your family if they're telling everyone about it. They obviously are encouraging her behavior.", "You don't owe her an apology AT ALL! \n\nThis isn't something you can just decide to fix one day.\nIt's not a one size fits all.\n\nShe's a friend of your parents, let her stay as that.\n\nReduce your contact for your own sanity, you don't need that fake relationship in your life.\n\nNTA, NTA, NTA, NTA, NTA!!!!! \ud83d\ude4c", "NTA.", "NTA ya there's lots of healthy ways to show concerns.. this wasn't even close.", "Yeh when I'm feeling down in the dumps, I go looking for depressed people to make me feel better.\n\n**NOT!!!!!!**\n\nYou need to be around things that are cheerful and positive or fun and happy. If someone wants to learn how to be a Dr. you don't send them to a cemetery to learn what not to do.\n\n**NTA**\n\nIf you don't feel like you want to tell her and your family to kiss your ass, you can tell them to kiss my ass. They did the exact opposite of what should have been done.", "NTA. If she\u2019s so good at saving people, why is her relative in such a shit situation?", "NTA\n\nWhat a toxic woman. What a terrible manipulative approach as you rightly say.  I am sorry your family are such AHs.", "THIS. OP, you are 100% NTA, and I am so sorry that this supposed \u201cfriend\u201d put you through this. \n\nI went through a rough time in my early 20s, before I\u2019d been officially diagnosed with anxiety and depression, and my mom took it upon herself to take me to visit my aunt and uncle who have both also struggled with their mental health, in an effort to get me to \u201copen up\u201d and \u201caccept help\u201d. They ambushed me and I SHUT DOWN. It turned into a screaming match and just thinking about it right now is making me anxious. \n\nMy mother realized VERY quickly that this had been the absolute worst way to approach this subject. I am 37 now (this occurred the summer I was 20) and my mom STILL apologizes to me when it comes up, which, thankfully, is not often. \n\nMy heart goes out to you, OP, take care of yourself!", "NTA", "Nta is she a counselor can she prescribe meds to help you ? Yeah she sounds like an idiot with her \" all depressed people are the same \"  stance . I'd blow her off too. Tell her you want to save her and say that you have a relative that's pushy and mean that you want her to meet .", "NTA. If you want help you can ask for it. If she wants to help she should let you know she\u2019s there if you need her. Tell her to mind her own business.", "NTA.. who does she think she is? So her help consist of her trying to \"snap\" you out of your depression by meeting her relative? hahaha with that level of knowledge about depression, she can help you with NOTHING!", "NTA I would have exploded on her what she did was disgusting and extremely intrusive I would honestly cut them all off whoever\u2019s even asking you to apologize to her too.", "NTA. Is your aunt the ghost of Christmas future??? Like wtf????? Also this other depressed relative just unknowingly a circus clown for this aunt to use as an example of a terrible life lived. \n\nThis relative is probably perfectly normal and has great coping skills but like grew their hair long during a depressive episode and left it long and everyone thinks they have just \u201clet themselves go\u201d", "NTA, fellow depressive here and that would piss me off. I would go NC with her. She has no idea what she is talking about.", "NTA. No where near.", "I can assure you my child is safe, I have worked extremely hard to keep it seperate. I can say it got worse after having him because I got PPD but I have worked so hard to show him a life that I didn\u2019t have. I know that he will grow up knowing that it\u2019s not taboo and that he can come to me for help and I am raising him with the knowledge my own parents denied. I have never broken down in front of anyone, I feel like I handle myself well without denying that I have depression. I really would hate for you to think I\u2019m a bad person for a having a child, I really try my hardest and he\u2019s the happiest boy I know and he is loved and he knows I love him and am here for him always.", "This^^ you need a restraining order. This person is unbelievably far left with their actions.", "NTA... and FUCK THAT BITCH!  \n\n\nI have had depression my whole life. I can figure it out myself and so can you. If you ever do feel the need to talk to someone about it, don't feel bad about doing so, but until then, everyone else can butt out.", "NTA- swap out the word depression with lupus or MS of any other chronic diseases and ask yourself if you think you would still be the AH", "NTA, do well to cut off that \"friend\" and family that supports her, you are a good mother, because those people who treat you like this will also treat your son like that when he has a problem or when it is not the case, if he also suffers depression; those people who think that depression can be cured simply by \"having courage\" are disastrous", "NTA. The woman is acting entitled! Take care of you.", "She sold it to me as a getaway where I would be free to relax and my son could meet some new kids for a change for us to have fun. Her family live there so it was a kind of \u201ccome meet my family while you\u2019re here\u201d type thing. She has been in the family for years so it didn\u2019t strike me as odd, it\u2019s a really nice holiday area \n\nI\u2019d been going through some changes recently which is why she suggested it as a break from life", "I made an update to clarify, I saw a few comments suggesting maybe they had a reason to be worried but I don\u2019t agree. I say I have struggled because depression for me anyway has been a lifelong battle and I haven\u2019t exactly seen the light to say it\u2019s over. I hope that makes sense, I am actively doing everything I can to help myself but of course there will always be something new to try when other options aren\u2019t working. I\u2019m still always learning new ways to cope and it has mostly been on my own as my family don\u2019t really understand or believe in the treatments or illness. I remember when I was growing up and telling them something was wrong and asking for help and their suggestions were generally \u201cjust think positive always\u201d you know? It\u2019s been a struggle and continues to be but I\u2019m trying my best. But I\u2019m rambling so sorry", "No, you don\u2019t need to apologize for anything and you aren\u2019t rambling. Are you getting medical treatment or therapy? Those are perhaps the two most important starting points."]}
