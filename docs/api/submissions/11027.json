I also don\u2019t know how to type well so forgive me. \n\nI (28f) have a family friend \u201cLisa\u201d (42f), she\u2019s been in the family for years and is a friend of my parents. It is very well known that I struggle with depression and always have and it\u2019s also worth noting that I am a very private person.\n\nA couple of weeks ago she asked me to come along with her to an out of town trip to meet her family. She wanted me to bring my son (7) along and said it was just a chance to give me a bit of a break from life. She asked me to bring my son because there would be kids around and thought it would be good for him to make some friends. I thought it was really sweet. \n\nJust before arriving she told me the real reason she invited me was because she has a depressed relative and wanted to show me what my future was going to look like if I didn\u2019t \u201csort out\u201d my depression. \n\nI felt sick and told her this was extremely manipulative and I drove home after we exchanged some words. I haven\u2019t spoken to her since. She\u2019s been texting me saying I owe her an apology and that I\u2019m going to end up like her relative if I don\u2019t let her help me. \n\nI just think it\u2019s not her responsibility to save me, I didn\u2019t ask for it and I have been perfectly capable of handling my own mental health. \n\nMy family have all sided with her and have said it was a good gesture and I\u2019m an asshole for not hearing her out. I feel sick to my stomach. I haven\u2019t even told her about my mental health so she took it upon herself to run with the information she had got from my parents and bombard me. It has made me want to stop sharing all together. I\u2019m not speaking with my family atm either because they think I should apologise. \n\nAita?", "created_utc": 1677479619, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11d4w0k/aita_for_telling_a_family_friend_to_stop_trying/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was going to \u201cout\u201d your mental health issues to everyone in her family with your son there.   \n\n\nYou don\u2019t owe her an apology. She owes you one.", "NTA. Of course you are angry. She's basically implying you are staying depressed on purpose, out of some defect of character, which is incredibly ableist and inaccurate. Depression is a biological illness of the brain. It's not your fault that you have depression, and you are doing the best you can. She was way out of line.\n\nI hate when people display their ableist bigotry and then have the audacity to claim they're \"just trying to help.\" No, she wasn't.", "NTA.  Wow, that\u2019s a nasty, manipulative thing to do.  Struggling with depression isn\u2019t a choice.  A lot of the things you can do to manage it (medication, therapy, diet, exercise, making self-care and health routines, etc) are choices, but I\u2019m gonna bet that you\u2019re doing your best with those things.\n\nYour family owes you an apology for outing you like that, and for supporting such an unhelpful, unkind \u201cintervention.\u201d", "NTA I think you went about it the exact right way. I would feel really betrayed by my family for sharing something so private. I also think they all clearly have a problematic view on depression. They are all treating it like a choice, when it is absolutely far from that. If we could all just choose to be happy and not depressed, we would. I\u2019m pretty horrified for you to be honest. I\u2019m sorry you had to experience that.", "NTA- that is so weirdly controlling of her. \nShe's treating you like an irresponsible child, she lied to you to stage a bizarre intervention like meeting?\nI would block her from anything to do with your life tbh. She sounds unhinged.", "NTA. That's effed up and they all owe you an apology.\n\nIf depression could be cured by just meeting another, more depressed person, we'd all be sublimely happy and only one poor dude somewhere would be miserable. It's absolute nonsense.", "NTA. Her \u201cgesture\u201d might have come from a good place at first but the fact that she kept pushing it was very wrong of her", "NTA. That's really weird on her part. \"You're depressed so I'm going to help by letting you meet someone that's even more depressed \". No wonder you don't want to go. Imagine what conversations she'd have with your child.", "NTA. \n\nYou are totally correct. No one can save you or fix you!\n\nOnly you can do that!\n\nPlus this toxic view that you will see someone \u201cworse off\u201d and *snap out of it* is soooo incorrect! You need help, medical professionals, meds, therapy or to figure out what works for you. \n\nPart of it is choosing to get past depression. Sure. But that part may come after a bunch of medical interventions, not because you saw someone worse off.", "NTA - She crossed a line.\n\nShe some how thinks taking you to see another depressed person who isn't doing too well will somehow make you want to deal with your mental health, something she knows little about. Not only that she is using that other person as a pawn by sharing their mental health issues and lifestyle with you. That's disgusting in my opinion. People aren't toys that can be played with and their mental health isn't some sort of teaching tool to use against them or you.... That other person is a victim of this too because it's unlikely they agreed to this. \n\nYour parents need to be told to stop talking about you to other people and if this were me I'd tell them if they didn't stop I would go NC permanently.", "That's some evil, manipulative behavior.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA, she knows *nothing* about depression and how to treat it and was so far out of line in doing this and can't even see the line any more. This was outrageous.", "NTA.\r  \n\n\nI've found that it is the very rare person who can understand depression without actually haven't gone through it, either as a one time thing or a lifetime thing.\r  \n\n\nWhat she did to you is first off way out of line, and second would be of absolutely no help at all, either to you or to the person she was going to bring you to, it would be sort of interesting to know if that person had any idea of what was coming.\r  \n\n\nI fervently hope that you come to peace with yourself, and if you think you need help that you can reach out on your own terms.  It reads like you do fine on your own, if so that's great.  Your family needs to learn/realize that the \"fixing', if even needed, has to start with you, not with some misguided trap.\r  \n\n\nGood luck to you, you don't owe anyone an apology, I can see a few being owed to you, your familyas much as the \"frined\".", "NTA. She lied to you. She's manipulative. She doesn't understand depression. She has an extremely inflated sense of her own self-importance. You don't need her anywhere near you.", "NTA. She\u2019s way out of line and making a lot of assumptions, your parents are also TA for telling her anything, your personal life is not there\u2019s to share.", "NTA and she is a full blown asshole. That was extremely manipulative on her part and you don't owe her any apologies.", "NTA. She manipulated in to going with her and then tried to manipulate you again by saying you\u2019re gonna end up like her relative.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is only rooted in her desire to \"white knight you.\" Ie make herself feel special and better then you. Your family enabling this is not ok."]}
