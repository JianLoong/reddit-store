Big culture shock for them, cause moving in with your kids is normal in many cultures. Its rough for your parents because a cultural era of life is lost to them because you live in and belong to a different culture now.

I know many cultures expect (or used to expect) that daughters were to spend their life caring for their parents, but that's not a thing in the US.  If that's something they wanted they should have discussed it with you and not just made assumptions.

If your brother is so wonderful, they can go live with him.", "NTA this is so strange to me. just about the only good thing about being a female south Asian in my opinion is that once you get married, your parents aren\u2019t your responsibility to care for when they get old. In fact it drives my uncle crazy that he feels socially and culturally obligated to house and care for his mother, while my mom (his sister) can just say \u201cno, my husband will only allow visits of one month, once a year\u201d and it isn\u2019t seen as disrespectful at all because women serving their husband\u2019s family seems to trump everything. (In mom\u2019s case, dad says no to give my mom cover, not because he is being controlling). \n\nI\u2019m a big fan of using stupid rules in my favor, so that\u2019s how I\u2019d play it in this situation. But your parents sound particularly horrible, so for my part, I think you made the right and responsible choice. They will be happier living with the son they love so much.

Especially since it sounds like they have not been very supportive of you over the years.", "NTA", "First, I think you are NTA in a US context. Your brother certainly owes your parents a lot more than you and has, IMHO, a duty based on filial piety that you don\u2019t. \n\nIn a South Asian cultural context, you would likely be considered an AH, and your parents are also AH\u2019s. Unfortunately lots of parents of girls in South Asia are AH\u2019s or much much worse than AH\u2019s, but even in that environment many treat their daughters well. So that would make it ESH, which is something you should let all those angry relatives know about. \n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m cheering for you here.

Their culture is that once you were born, the first female child, (or the last depending on the culture), you are alive to take care of them in their old age. As such in their original culture you do not require any of the things that they gave to your brother, such as a chance at a good education or good job prospects etc. In that culture you are born to care for them. \n\nThis is not a cultural idea that we in most of the western world can relate to. \n\nHow can you bridge this cultural divide, and stay in contact with your family?

I'd have done the same thing and am about to have a similar conversation with my own mom. Barely owned my home two years and she's already talking about moving in. Smh. \n\nNo. Your parents had 30-40 years to save up for their retirement. Just expecting you to pay for them and take care of them is ridiculous without any previous conversation or agreement in place.\n\nI wouldn't even offer to pay for them to go into a home. I'd tell them they better take the house off the market before they make a mistake and sell their bought off home out from under themselves, because there will be no shelter or sleeping here.

Her name was Shanti De Corte. Every single psychiatrist involved in her case, including the two who signed off on her euthanasia, ought to have their license revoked.\n\nA veteran in Canada, who reached out to Veterans Affairs because he was struggling, was immediately bombarded with \u201cassisted suicide\u201d resources.

Patients are given strong pain-relievers, such as morphine, at their request."]}
