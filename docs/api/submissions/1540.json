Big culture shock for them, cause moving in with your kids is normal in many cultures. Its rough for your parents because a cultural era of life is lost to them because you live in and belong to a different culture now.

Seriously impressed.", "NTA, stick to your guns!", "NTA- your parents had no problem not supporting you but somehow expect the world from you without even asking.

Good work. Keep it up.", "Good job setting and enforcing your boundaries. You are rightfully fed up already with their \u201ccultural\u201d expectations that are in fact patriarchal norms that have no place in your household.

I know many cultures expect (or used to expect) that daughters were to spend their life caring for their parents, but that's not a thing in the US.  If that's something they wanted they should have discussed it with you and not just made assumptions.

If your brother is so wonderful, they can go live with him.", "NTA this is so strange to me. just about the only good thing about being a female south Asian in my opinion is that once you get married, your parents aren\u2019t your responsibility to care for when they get old. In fact it drives my uncle crazy that he feels socially and culturally obligated to house and care for his mother, while my mom (his sister) can just say \u201cno, my husband will only allow visits of one month, once a year\u201d and it isn\u2019t seen as disrespectful at all because women serving their husband\u2019s family seems to trump everything. (In mom\u2019s case, dad says no to give my mom cover, not because he is being controlling). \n\nI\u2019m a big fan of using stupid rules in my favor, so that\u2019s how I\u2019d play it in this situation. But your parents sound particularly horrible, so for my part, I think you made the right and responsible choice. They will be happier living with the son they love so much.

Especially since it sounds like they have not been very supportive of you over the years.", "NTA", "First, I think you are NTA in a US context. Your brother certainly owes your parents a lot more than you and has, IMHO, a duty based on filial piety that you don\u2019t. \n\nIn a South Asian cultural context, you would likely be considered an AH, and your parents are also AH\u2019s. Unfortunately lots of parents of girls in South Asia are AH\u2019s or much much worse than AH\u2019s, but even in that environment many treat their daughters well. So that would make it ESH, which is something you should let all those angry relatives know about. \n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m cheering for you here. Sounds like parents only ever saw you as a servant and are now reaping the rewards of treating family like shit.", "NTA. I like the way you have handled it.", "You did great.

Their culture is that once you were born, the first female child, (or the last depending on the culture), you are alive to take care of them in their old age. As such in their original culture you do not require any of the things that they gave to your brother, such as a chance at a good education or good job prospects etc. In that culture you are born to care for them. \n\nThis is not a cultural idea that we in most of the western world can relate to. \n\nHow can you bridge this cultural divide, and stay in contact with your family?

You could live in a mansion and still not be obligated to give them space in your home. It was pretty presumptuous of them to list their own secure home and just expect to move in with you without even consulting you. I'd have done the same thing and am about to have a similar conversation with my own mom. Barely owned my home two years and she's already talking about moving in. Smh. \n\nNo. Your parents had 30-40 years to save up for their retirement. Just expecting you to pay for them and take care of them is ridiculous without any previous conversation or agreement in place.\n\nI wouldn't even offer to pay for them to go into a home.

You need to reconsider your priorities! /s\n\nYour parents announcement and shock at your refusal is completely in line with traditional familial duties but stand your ground!

Different cultures. Yes different cultures different customs and traditions. But I say this in many comments. There are traditions and expectations, but in 2022 there is also globalization, internet, social media, culture and education. We have to evolve. OP did. I am taking care of my mom (while in a EU country) but she never demanded it from me, and we share some expenses.  Oppression because of gender, blood, family ties, race, sexual orientation or religion should cease to exist. And people should start ignoring them for them to become obsolete. NTA OP I am proud for you, for moving forward and achieving things alone in a sense (no family support)", "NTA. Desi here. Fuck yes! (Sorry mods for cursing) not to harsh. What you are describing is the tip of the iceberg. The amount of boundary smashing and BS you dealt with growing up couldn\u2019t even be described in the character limit I imagine.

Never change.", "NTA.\nCongratulations on setting clear boundaries and not surrendering to emotional slavery. \n\nThat\u2019s hard to when you come from certain cultures (I should know). Your brother has some nerve, doing nothing but opening his mouth.\nStay strong Girl. And be proud of yourself.", "This is a hard one to judge. I understand why you are doing this, but coming from a traditional culture, I see why your family thinks you are an AH. I think I'll say you are NTA, but you are callous. Hopefully, your child does not treat you the same way you treated your parents in old age.", "ESH \n\nYou are perfectly within your rights to not want them to live with you especially when there are so many retirement homes with levels of care that scale up as you require it but holy shit what an overreaction.", "Hell, you aren't entitled to anything that anyone *does* want to give you. NTA", "I have already given their information to the guards at the gate to our community.  They are not moving in here.", "Same!", "NTA. Congratulations on building a happy life for yourself and escaping your parents\u2019 expectations that you would be their uneducated and downtrodden caregiver till the day they died.", "I came to write that op is a flipping rock star.

They nurtured and launched their son \u2014 and kept their daughter alive long enough to tend to them in their old age\ufffc.\n\nBut they made the mistake of not raising their child in their culture (where duty trumps affection), and she\u2019s not going to return a loveless childhood with years of late-life care.\ufffc\n\nNTA", "My best friend is Caucasian, and has North American and British roots. Three kids in her family, and both her sibs (one female and one male) keep suggesting she take her mother into her home. My friend is absolutely devoted to her mother and expends a lot of time and energy providing support (much more than her siblings), but doesn't want to live with her. The only significant difference between her and her sibs? She is a single parent, and female. Gender bs is exactly that. I totally agree with your assessment, and it's all so tiresome still, but definitely stronger in some cultures than others.", "Not that I believe in chauvinistic views, but I'd be petty and OP should say she's not part of their family name. She married into OPs husband's family, so she has obligations to care for her ILs now, not her parents lol", "This is such a common dynamic in that culture.  Although the golden son actually completed a degree and has a normal life instead of failing to launch.\n\nI'm wondering why the brother wasn't the first choice.  Maybe I've been reading too many Mil stories but I would think she would love to intrude on that family and try to push the wife aside to mold 5 young minds into worshipping her .\n\nIs 5 too many ?

That's a pretty clear statement they don't see her as a daughter anymore.", "Seems harsh that you want to force your way to live with your married child until you pass? \nNo. Child has her family now. If it doesn't work for them, it doesn't. Child isn't even saying I want to abandon you, just, don't live with me until you die, I will contribute to your living and that is now a crime?

But it sounds like they believe they have no responsibility to her, but she is forever indebted because they birthed her.\n\nMy brother in law funds his parents retirement- but they scrimped to fund his college and grad school, and that was always the understood deal.", "She doesn\u2019t seem like the kind of mom to treat her children like her parents treated her. Cultural or not, her parents were major A H to her. They are reaping what they sowed. OP you are NTA", "Callous? What\u2019s so particularly callous about OP\u2019s approach here?", "This wasn't an over reaction.

There are First Peoples, Native Americans, or Indigenous peoples - none of whom are Caucasian. Simply saying Caucasian is enough to indicate her European heritage.\n\nAlthough I agree that society's patriarchal and misogynistic tendencies to try to pigeon hole women into certain expected roles.\n\nI got care for an elder as a result of being the only one with single-level living & WFH.

I was expected to clean everything and take care of everyone just because I was the oldest.

All of my friends are from university or met through my husband who is South American.", "That is a fair feeling, but that takes into account that you have a healthy relationship with your parents where they treat you as a full adult with respect to your own autonomy, in the home you yourself own. OPs parents wouldn't treat her like that. They expect her to be a servant even now that she's married and is starting a family.\n\nI am lucky enough to have built that kind of relationship with my mother, and to have had her reciprocate the work that goes into maintaining it since I was a young teen.\n\nMy husband and I moved in with my mother shortly after we started dating and we lost our jobs, and when we bought our first home, we moved her with us, because we wanted to make sure that she was taken care of and had a safe place to live. \n\n15 years later, and we are all quite comfortable, mom is able to work part time and rent her room from us, while me and hubby work full time. We don't have any kids, but we do have 4 cats, and none of what we have would have been possible if we had moved in with his parents instead of my mom. His parents, mostly his father, are overbearing, controlling, pushy, demanding, and highly disrespectful. \n\nI'm blessed to have the mom and the husband that I do. They adore each other, even when we all get on each other's nerves. \n\nOp, lean on your hubby when you need to. It's obvious he loves you deeply, and he will be your rock. Love all your children for the amazing individual human beings that they will become. 1, 2, 30. OK, Hopefully not 30, lol. That would be a very hard pregnancy to carry 29 at once. Regardless, you will be an amazing mom, and your husband will be an amazing dad. Occasional favoritism happens, we are human. Forgive yourself and work to do better when it does. And just make sure that you don't overcompensate for the sexism you grew up with if you happen to have a son and a daughter. And it is ok if you feel it is better for their emotional and mental health to not expose your children to your parents toxic \"cultural traditions\".", "Do you even hear yourself? They listed their house without talking about it. OP offers many different alternatives AND pays for a year of rent, which she should not have done. Good on her for that.
