You\u2019re freaking heroic!", "NTA\n\n\nBut don't be surprised if they just show up and try to force this.", "I think that was a wonderful idea to pay for everything for your mom and dad.  I'm getting older myself and my daughter said that she would do the same thing for me when the time comes and I love the idea. I don't want to be a burden on her and her family.", "So proud of you for foraging your own path! NTA.", "USA opinion here. Big culture shock for them, cause moving in with your kids is normal in many cultures. Its rough for your parents because a cultural era of life is lost to them because you live in and belong to a different culture now. My only insight into how they may have treated you is memes from my first gen roomie from college, and it can be pretty unfair sometimes.\n\nYou dont suck, they belong to a different culture and expected something else so they cant deserve the suck that much, this just sucks.\n\nNTA", "I have the feeling cultural expectations are at play here and that being the girl puts - and has put -  the burden of care on you. Good for you for standing up for yourself.  NTA.", "NTA. You are entitled to live your life any way you see fit. This makes it necessary to break the cultural mold. Your parents cannot be completely oblivious to the ways of the modern world, and if they are, it is on them. It was wrong of them to treat you like a servant, when you were growing up and it is wrong of them to think that you would want to live with them now. If going NC with them is what it takes to make them take in the facts, then so be it. If it \"breaks up\" the family, well too bad. Not all families are worth fighting for.", "NTA.  I am very impressed with the hard line boundaries you set up so quickly and I have a feeling you will have no problem keeping them.  As to the rest of the family, as you have stated, they are welcome to open up their homes and or wallets and house them if they feel so strongly about the family \"image\".  Seriously impressed.", "NTA, stick to your guns!", "NTA- your parents had no problem not supporting you but somehow expect the world from you without even asking. It's mind boggling that they just assumed they would move in with you. Your parents should use the money from the sale of the home to build a suite on your brothers house and then everyone should be happy.", "My parents are in their sixties.

My parents are very 'traditional' and in our family no one goes into a home you take care of your elders but learning about how toxic some of those people were I'm kind of shocked that the older generation put up with that. \n\nIn my opinion Family is not defined by blood rather by support and you have made your own family clan. My husband has as well. He has been on his own since he was 16 and his 'family' are friends that helped take him in.  I wish you all the best and from a stranger, I see you taking care of yourself and your mental health over the wishes of others.", "YES!!!!! LOVE THAT!!!
