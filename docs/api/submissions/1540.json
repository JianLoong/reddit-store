Big culture shock for them, cause moving in with your kids is normal in many cultures. Its rough for your parents because a cultural era of life is lost to them because you live in and belong to a different culture now. My only insight into how they may have treated you is memes from my first gen roomie from college, and it can be pretty unfair sometimes.\n\nYou dont suck, they belong to a different culture and expected something else so they cant deserve the suck that much, this just sucks.\n\nNTA", "I have the feeling cultural expectations are at play here and that being the girl puts - and has put -  the burden of care on you.

Your parents cannot be completely oblivious to the ways of the modern world, and if they are, it is on them. It was wrong of them to treat you like a servant, when you were growing up and it is wrong of them to think that you would want to live with them now.

I am very impressed with the hard line boundaries you set up so quickly and I have a feeling you will have no problem keeping them.

Seriously impressed.", "NTA, stick to your guns!", "NTA- your parents had no problem not supporting you but somehow expect the world from you without even asking.

Good work. Keep it up.", "Good job setting and enforcing your boundaries. You are rightfully fed up already with their \u201ccultural\u201d expectations that are in fact patriarchal norms that have no place in your household. Your brother can build an ADU or buy a bigger place if he wants to take them in.  You made several reasonable attempts at compromise and that wasn\u2019t even necessary.  Love is not transactional.

Traumatize your parents back", "If they\u2019re so obsessed with tradition and living with the kids then why don\u2019t they follow the south Asian tradition where the parents live with the son?? \n\nNo south Asian parent should be burdening their daughter like that because they\u2019re supposed to live with their son. \n\nGood on you for standing your ground", "NTA\n\nI'm Asian as well and it's so typical that the male child is The Golden Child \u2122\ufe0f, the daughter is treated like crap but *also* expected to take care of the parents when they're elderly. It happened in my family as well. The whole thing is BS.\n\nGood for you for standing up for yourself. The thing is, if you did take them in, they'd still treat you like crap. That's your function in the family: to be used and spat out. Your brother, though. He'll always be coddled and valued. Fck him, too.", "NTA\n\nThey did not want to invest in your future, so why should they reap the rewards of your success?

I know many cultures expect (or used to expect) that daughters were to spend their life caring for their parents, but that's not a thing in the US.  If that's something they wanted they should have discussed it with you and not just made assumptions.

That's assuming they really did put it on the market.", "NTA", "NTA - good for you not adhering to the stereotypical expectations.  You know what you want from life and not wanting to be weighed down from people that could just do the minimum for you as a child.", "NTA \nI don't think anyone should just tell you they're moving in and you're going to take care of them, parents or otherwise.  The fact that they approached this the way they did is foreshadowing the way they would disrespect any boundaries you have in your home.  \n\nA dutiful daughter- ha!

If your brother is so wonderful, they can go live with him.", "NTA this is so strange to me. just about the only good thing about being a female south Asian in my opinion is that once you get married, your parents aren\u2019t your responsibility to care for when they get old. In fact it drives my uncle crazy that he feels socially and culturally obligated to house and care for his mother, while my mom (his sister) can just say \u201cno, my husband will only allow visits of one month, once a year\u201d and it isn\u2019t seen as disrespectful at all because women serving their husband\u2019s family seems to trump everything. (In mom\u2019s case, dad says no to give my mom cover, not because he is being controlling). \n\nI\u2019m a big fan of using stupid rules in my favor, so that\u2019s how I\u2019d play it in this situation. But your parents sound particularly horrible, so for my part, I think you made the right and responsible choice. They will be happier living with the son they love so much.

You went above and beyond with just sending that money - I hope you get some peace from their nonsense soon!", "Nta", "NTA all the way. You're handlings things just perfectly.

Especially since it sounds like they have not been very supportive of you over the years.", "NTA", "First, I think you are NTA in a US context. Your brother certainly owes your parents a lot more than you and has, IMHO, a duty based on filial piety that you don\u2019t. \n\nIn a South Asian cultural context, you would likely be considered an AH, and your parents are also AH\u2019s. Unfortunately lots of parents of girls in South Asia are AH\u2019s or much much worse than AH\u2019s, but even in that environment many treat their daughters well. So that would make it ESH, which is something you should let all those angry relatives know about. \n\nTo be honest, I\u2019m cheering for you here. Sounds like parents only ever saw you as a servant and are now reaping the rewards of treating family like shit.", "NTA. I like the way you have handled it.", "You did great.

Their culture is that once you were born, the first female child, (or the last depending on the culture), you are alive to take care of them in their old age. As such in their original culture you do not require any of the things that they gave to your brother, such as a chance at a good education or good job prospects etc. In that culture you are born to care for them. \n\nThis is not a cultural idea that we in most of the western world can relate to. \n\nHow can you bridge this cultural divide, and stay in contact with your family? That is a very hard problem to solve.\n\nGood luck, I have friends that have had to navigate this, and it was beyond difficult.", "NTA", "NTA.

Well they were wrong. \n\nYou brother can take them, or any of the deeply concerned family or community members but that has nothing to do with you.\n\nCongratulations on your new family member!

You could live in a mansion and still not be obligated to give them space in your home.

I'd have done the same thing and am about to have a similar conversation with my own mom. Barely owned my home two years and she's already talking about moving in. Smh. \n\nNo. Your parents had 30-40 years to save up for their retirement. Just expecting you to pay for them and take care of them is ridiculous without any previous conversation or agreement in place.\n\nI wouldn't even offer to pay for them to go into a home. I'd tell them they better take the house off the market before they make a mistake and sell their bought off home out from under themselves, because there will be no shelter or sleeping here.
