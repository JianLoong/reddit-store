They say they want OP to be an adult but then turn around and treat OP like a child who can't do anything without their help.\n\nNTA.", "Tell your parents that they are not professionals in the field so they can not diagnose you.", " I would emphasize that you don\u2019t have time to mess around and entertain every random guest they bring in.", "There's nothing really wrong with that. OP clearly has productive stuff they're working on. If everyone is okay with it and gets along, whats the problem?", "They're not his guests. He's not obligated to speak to people he didn't invite over/doesn't know, especially when he's scrambling to prepare for postgraduate studies and, oh yeah, *moving out of the country.* Not to mention OP said his dad has been pressuring him to finish the postgraduate paperwork, but also wants him to forgo said paperwork to host people his parents invite on a whim? Where's the logic?", "> Also remind them that since you are now \"a man\" and \"independant\", you are not obliged to come and parade in front of their guests as a child would be asked to.\n\nI'll never understand these parents.  \"My kid is independent and resourceful and smart and successful and will be found dead in a dumpster in a sewer underneath a Burger King if I don't control their every moment.\"\n\nmuhfucker *pick one*", "Had parents like this, glad I went no contact.", "Congratulations on your successes and hard work!", "The expectations include seeing a psychiatrist for made up ailments and being medicated for them?", "> \u201cWhen people come over, don\u2019t run away.\u201d\n\nSo your parents don't know how to entertain guests. Tell them- they should not invite them if they have no idea how to communicate. Not your faults that their social life sucks.\n\nNTA", "NTA but they want you gone.", "NTA. But are your parents trying to find you a spouse or something? I can\u2019t see why it\u2019s so important otherwise to him\u2026", "NTA, wtf are your parents on about.", "NTA. I have social anxiety. You are trying to get set up for yoru postgraduate studies and further your education which is a lot of work and which should take priority over socializing with your PARENT's guests. You are being an adult and working on your education and your future rather than entertaining people you parent's invite over.", "NTA\n\nYou aren\u2019t avoiding people, you are actively trying to finalize paperwork to do graduate study.  This is just odd.", "The mental health bit is just.. bizarre", "Uh, no.  NTAH.  Just gives you more incentive to get your paperwork in and get out of that house.", "Bizarre behavior. You are focused and taking care of things and they want you to drop anything to say hi to someone you may or may not know? Ridiculous. Not to mention they have misdiagnosed you. NTA.", "Tell your parents that they are not professionals in the field so they can not diagnose you.", "Oh I don't mean it excuses them. It doesn't. You are clearly working hard and maturing in ways they need to. Good on you for having your head on straight. You are on a roll and should definitely not stop for some company. You will have time for that later once you are all set in life and it won't negatively impact your goals", "Yeah, seems pretty obvious the parents just want him out of the house. \n\nI worry about OP\u2019s ability to complete grad work in English if he can\u2019t read between those lines.", "Yes, he is obligated by manners and decency to speak to people his parents have over to their home when he is there. It doesn\u2019t say he doesn\u2019t know them, nor would it matter. He is making it look to his parents\u2019 friends like he is rude and raised poorly, probably embarrassing them. If I came home with a friend and my adult child refused to come out and say hello, I would be appalled. Luckily, that would never happen as I did my job well enough.", "You're disregarding the fact that OP spends most of his time trying to get and finish the paperwork *his dad is pressuring him to finish* and doesn't feel like entertaining his parent's guests when he gets a moment to himself. I get where OP is coming from. College admissions are hectic on their own, but trying to do a college admission and find housing and travel arrangements for a college in a different country? I can't imagine. If OP's situation happened to me, I would be livid, and it would only damage my relationship with my parents and the parent's friends more than if I had just been left alone. It honestly wouldn't be a problem if OP only had to say hi and exchange small talk for 10 minutes before getting back to his planning, but OP's dad wants him to stay the whole time the guests are over. That could be hours. That is unreasonable.", "They are not using 18 hours a day on \u201cpaperwork\u201d and where did you get the idea that they must spend hours? Ten minutes of meeting and greeting before excusing oneself to complete needed tasks would be more than enough for politeness. If it\u2019s actually hours demanded of them, that\u2019s far too much.", "I said it *could* be hours. I don't know how long the guests are staying, but I know some guests do stay that long. It varies.", "But does OP have to entertain them for hours or politely greet them? We don\u2019t really know either way.", "Hopefully only politely greet them. I'm with you on that one. Pretty reasonable. But we can only guess.", "This post is truly incomprehensible", "NTA.  Tell your dad that you have obligations for your next step in your life.  Tell him that anyone coming to visit needs to be on a family calendar so you know in advance and you can let them know if you are available. \n\nDo they want you  to move out?", "Yep. Also, you absolutely should not cater to people all the time. Boundaries are healthy.", "Also if they don't care about your opinion, they probably care about the guests' opinions, and shame is a powerful tool. Don't forget to let the guests know how inconsiderate your parents are being by pointing out their visit is a complete surprise that was sprung on you while you were busy, and apologize that you can't be a better host because of that. Things of that nature.\n\nHopefully you can fix the problem before it gets that far again though.", "NTA", "NAH. I get the feeling there is a lot more going on here than meets the eye. Here's a guess -- just a guess -- that your parents are purposefully trying to make their house a little uncomfortable for you so you'll be motivated to move out sooner rather than later. Could that be it?", "You're 26 and being paraded / boasted about to your parents' friends. Screams Asian. I don't relate at all. /sarcasm\n\nNTA by a long mile. I'm an introvert so I tend to avoid my parents' friends after doing the basic courtesies and just making sure they have drinks/food aka being a good host. But I don't entertain their guests. I go away and let them talk.", "They think they are the only 2 people that matter in this trio. They are used to total control of his time and are embarrassed he won't show up on demand in front of their friends.", "Oh, ok.\n\nThanks for the explanation!\n\nI had no idea people would \"steal karma\" for spam. But I'm very new here.\n\nThanks again!", "So which is it: Stop standing up for yourself and talking back to him assertively and \u201chumble yourself\u201d instead, or stand up for yourself more assertively because you need to treat your social anxiety? He can\u2019t have it both ways.\n\nLooks like it\u2019s all manipulation. \u201cDo what I want or else I\u2019ll label you with a bullshit diagnosis that fits whatever I want you to do.\u201d NTA.", "This is wackadoodle", "YTA but only just. The reason is because you haven't set out with your parents what you are doing and when. If you were up front rather than reactive you could explain that you're not available at specific times but you will be available at other times. \n\nYou're still under their roof it seems. You're also clearly from a culture where respect still matters. So you have to fulfill those requirements. \n\nYou don't need to see a psych. You don't need meds. You do need to shake the social anxiety probably. Take the lead. Be the man you say you are.", "NTA. Please enjoy your time in England! Your father is unhinged", "NTA, Don't listen to your parents they are being total assholes. Bail out come to fair blighty. If you study in London don't fall for anyone taking you out for an eel pie its a trap."]}
