I was wearing white shorts for the occasion, and of course when I was dancing, I felt myself bleed through my tampon. I knew I didn't have long before it would start to show through my shorts. \n\nWhen I got to the women's bathroom, of course there was a massive line (and no line for the men's) that was probably about 30-40 people long. I announced to the entire line that I was having a girl emergency and asked if it was okay if I cut. I heard no objections as well as people encouraging me to go forward. I did this 3 times down the line, including when I physically got into the bathroom just to make sure and again heard no objections. \n\nI got into the stall, took care of my business, and while some blood did soak through my shorts, it wasn't enough to be noticeable. \n\nThe second I got out of the stall, a woman with her what looked to be 5 yr old son, who had been farther back in line, began berating me for cutting in line. The first thing she said to me was, \"Where's the blood?? If it was such an emergency then where's the blood?\" She then went off about how I am an adult and there were children in line who had been waiting for a long time and I just cut in front of everyone and that it was very rude of me to go. I tried to end the conversation multiple times because of how verbally aggressive she was being but she would not stop and basically had me corned in the bathroom berating me and saying I had no excuse and that I should've known better than to wear white shorts while on my period. \n\nWhile I personally don't think that the way she came at me was appropriate, I am wondering, AITA for cutting the entire line to take care of my bleeding? Should I have just dealt with the consequences of my actions? Should I have known better to not wear white shorts?\n\nThe action that I'm wanting to be judged for is me cutting the long line. And I think that I might be the asshole for being inconsiderate to all of the other people.\n\nEdit to add: \nA lot of people are saying that I should've told her off. Well I kind of did. I tried to minimize the situation with her but she was having none of it, so eventually I told her that her attitude and the way she was speaking to me was not influencing me all (she didn't care) and after continuously berating me, I asked her \"Do you want to look at my crotch??\" And I lifted my leg. To which she responded, \"No! There are children in here, no one wants to see that!\" And then I told her, \"You asked!\" She continues to berate me so as I was finally leaving and got around her, I ended with (and this might make me a jerk), \"Your kids are going to grow up to be bullies!\" She shouted for me to shut up. \n\nSo again I'm not concerned with whether or not I was the asshole in the situation with her because I do think clearly she was an asshole. I'm just wondering if I was the asshole with everyone else in line. Seems like the general census was that I was in the right. \n\nBut next time I will be more prepared in wearing a panty liner and yeah maybe not wearing white shorts during shark week.", "created_utc": 1688565218, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14rbbv3/aita_for_cutting_a_long_line_when_i_was_bleeding/", "score": 1162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And a panty liner + tampon seems to work the best", "NTA.  Every single woman in that line has experienced what you experienced.

Basic human kindness.", "YTA and I don't get all these NTA. But it seems like I'll be downvoted to hell. You asked 3x down the line of 30+ people? That means you cut 27 people without asking them....any single person saying no should have been where you stopped. There were children in line, and I'm sure people with bladder/bowel issues who really needed to go. \n\n\nYou're an adult. You knew you were on your period, you knew you were wearing white shorts, you knew you were going somewhere crowded. Wear a panty line or pad with the tampon. Go change it earlier than you think you need to to account for a long bathroom line.", "YTA. People were waiting. What happens if a kid pees themselves now?", "NTA. Every person who menstruates has been there and knows how uncomfortable that is. I would have gladly let you cut. Periods are so unpredictable. And it\u2019s not your fault for wearing white.

One of the things that still gives me hope for people is there are certain things 99% of people will understand when it comes to the unfortunate necessities caused by our bodies.  It's one thing we have in common and can empathize with.    I am glad most of the people in the line could show that there were good people who were willing to accept what you said.   Ignore the one person that was having a cranky time.   You said she had a young son - as a guy I'd not have blinked if she'd called into the mens room and asked if it was OK for her to escort her son into a stall.

It\u2019s your responsibility to be prepared when on your period and to understand the risks of only wearing a tampon to a festival that is always likely to have long lines. Your emergency is not any one else\u2019s problem. The ladies in line were nice to allow you to cut but honestly it wasn\u2019t their problem. And by allowing it they did sacrifice the comfort and possibly well being of any children (who have been waiting and are not always great at holding their bladders) and shy women who are less likely to speak up, even if they are not ok with the situation. Regardless of the color of your shorts, you should know to be more prepared. Since you were at the festival without adult supervision going to the bathroom, the assumption is you\u2019re old enough to know how to plan/prepare for shark week.", "That lady needs to take a chill pill.

Kleenex, paper towel you could have placed in your shorts with a little discretion, then got in line. It's not like you had diarrhea running down your legs & were stinking up the place. That woman sounds insanely rude to you & had no business saying what she did. But since you asked, women know not to wear white when they might bleed into it.", "Esh. Her because she was overreacting and ridiculous. You because you made a choice to wear white while in your period, you should be taking care of changing tampons before you get to the bleeding through point and using the word emergency is why you got no objections, but your failure to better take care of yourself isn't an emergency you weren't in danger or anything but embarrassment from your own poor choices.", "ESH. She was rude as shit, but you're claiming an emergency to get in a bathroom ahead of a queue that includes parents with children.", "NTA for asking to cut. \n\nYTA for wearing white shorts while on your period. Like come on. \n\nAlso I think young kids having to pee is at least on equal footing, if not higher, than an adult woman having a feminine emergency because she got too caught up in dancing, so while I would have let you go ahead, I get why the mom was upset. Although her questioning where\u2019s the blood was ridiculous.", "NTA - there are times when line cutting is appropriate. I once cut a whole tsa line after I was told I needed to take a foster cat who I was flying to his forever home out of his carrier and walk him through x-Ray. I ran through shouting sorry, sorry, I have a cat and I guarantee those people were just feeling lucky not to be me.", "NTA. For young people reading this, OP did exactly the right thing. Don't let the asshole women who questioned her dissuade you from doing this in an emergency. All bleeding females have had this feeling before and we get it 100%.   \n\n\nOP, I am sorry this happened to you. You are NTA at all. You handled all of it very well.   \n\n\nTo anyone, anywhere, everywhere who plans new buildings, *WE NEED MORE BATHROOM STALLS*. We have more to do in the bathroom because for like 30+ years of our lives we have periods 25%-ish of the time. We take longer. We have lines very frequently. Please reconsider the ratios/overall count of stalls for the women's bathrooms as you plan new buildings, esp for any venues, arenas, airports, places of mass gathering. Please. We beg you. Thank you so much for coming to my Ted Talk.", "I'm confused how so many women wear white without a pad or liners as backup for a tampon.  \nI'm also confused why there's 30 women waiting in line and no one goes into the men's. With festivals the men's are often cleaner than the womens bathroom in my experience.  \n\nI'm gonna say YTA for shitty period planning causing you to cut a line. (Could have worn a different color shorts, could have used more means to avoid any form bleeding through and you could have gone into the men's.)", "YTA for wearing white shorts during your period honestly. \n\nWas this your *first* time getting your period?

Blood would be visible through most colours and types of pants, even black. She thought her period was nearly over and I think most of us have been too optimistic and put on a cute pair of underwear or pants because we think it's over and then boom it isn't. Plus heat, dancing, standing for ages can make flow heavier, from experience, and not everyone is going to be able to prepare for that. Some hours are lighter, some are heavier, flows change all the time and this woman went as soon as she felt something was up. Was she optimistic wearing white shorts? Hell yeah, but that doesn't make her TA. Anyone with IBS, bladder issues, kids about to burst, disabled and can't stand for that long, period emergencies, anyone super desperate is all good in my book to ask to skip. Also again, cornering someone and demanding to see their blood is cuckoo bananas and out of line. She could've asked to skip and I guarantee they would have let her too. She big mad she didn't think to do that. I have PCOS and explosive blood emergencies happen, they can happen to anyone who gets periods, whether they're regular or not. You can't always plan for them, they're unpredictable af. Good on you for asking and checking with everyone and not just shoving in being all I take priority. There's no harm in asking.\n\nAnyway, period emergencies happen, planned for or not, it just happens. It's not a big deal to ask to go in front. Of course everyone is welcome to say no, but no one did. You can't undo going to the bathroom to please her. She could've asked to skip or take her boy to the men's \ud83e\udd37 I've seen people take kids into either bathroom, whether their or the kids gender matches the bathroom sign or not cause kids can't hold it for very long, no one would have cared if she'd gone to the men's with no line, kids don't care they just need to pee.", "Her son could have gone to the men's room that didn't have a line. Just saying.", "Male here, but having grown up in a house with three females and being married with a teenage daughter, I'd definitely say you were justified.  I carry a box of what I was raised to call 'Lady Products' in my car for just such an emergency.  It might seem strange for a  grown man to do so, but as I said, I was raised in a house with three girls.  And it's definitely paid off; more than once I've kept a small problem from becoming an embarrassing one.", "NTA. If she had a problem with it she should've spoke up at any point when OP asked.

I feel like people are usually pretty generous when it comes to situations like those. It\u2019s too bad the lady in line took it the way she did\u2014if she had asked, people probably would\u2019ve let them skip, too.", "I always say that I'm looking forward to full menopause because then I can wear white pants/skirts.  I'm 51 and I don't own any white skirts/pants yet.", "Eh, flow can vary.

NTA, but OP definitely has more guts than I do rocking white shorts xD", "With all due respect, why does it matter that she\u2019s wearing white shorts? Yes the blood is going to show if there\u2019s a leak, but regardless of what color bottoms she\u2019s wearing, the discomfort alone is a good reason to ask about cutting the line. I was bleeding heavily on an international trip. I popped a tampon in before a three hour flight, and right before we landed, I got a sudden gush I was not at all expecting. Since we were landing, I couldn\u2019t use the airplane bathroom, so I had to wait until we departed.

Regardless of the color, walking around with bloody pants is uncomfortable and unhygienic.", "It\u2019s so weird to me. I spend a quarter of my life on my period or at risk of unexpected pre/post flow. I\u2019m going to wear whatever the fuck I want. Which won\u2019t be white shorts, because I will definitely sully them immediately leaning against a brick wall or dusty car. \n\nAnd obviously, I try to avoid leaks, but I bleed or potentially could bleed 65-75 days every year. It\u2019s bound to happen eventually.", "This is exactly how I feel and is put much more eloquently than I could right now. Op, this is the right response.", "Real assholes are def the organizers lol. Women need 2x the bathrooms as men generally get at big events bcus women take kids with them, spend more time in the bathroom, have other reasons to use it like tampons, and have way more bladder emergencies when pregnant or post partum", "She said *girl* emergency.

Or use the men\u2019s room.

My period has been extremely reliable for 25 years now and I still don\u2019t always get it right. You do your best but every now and then it doesn\u2019t work out as planned. It\u2019s fine.

I did that 3 times. \n\nAnd I don't expect to get special treatment from anyone else with a similar emergency, if you physically cannot keep something from coming out of you, like a child, or someone with irritable bowel syndrome, or even someone who is just plain about to explode in their pants, I would personally give them all a go ahead before me. \n\nI do however think I went to a large event unprepared and should've worn a pantyliner, I just thought my period was almost over, and wasnt expecting to bleed through.", "If a kid is about to pee themselves they can also cut or use the men\u2019s room.
