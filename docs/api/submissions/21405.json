Anytime you see a woman with a little kid making the pee ppe dance. They get to go. A pregnant lady? Sure. \n\nSomeone bleeding through their clothes, especially white, gets to go to the front. If her son was that bad off, she could have done the same. But the audacity to ask to see the blood? Damn, that's unnecessary.", "NTA. No woman in her right mind would ever ask another woman \u00ab\u00a0where\u2019s the blood??\u00a0\u00bb in response to a period emergency. Some people are just mean, bitter people. She is one of them. Don\u2019t worry, it has nothing to do with you.", "NTA. You asked and if it was such a big deal to her to approach a stranger asking about blood, then she should have spoke up when you asked to jump the line near her.", "NTA you did ask multiple times down the line. No one objected. Risky move wearing white during shark week though.", " NTA. This is one of those times where you get a free pass to cut the line. It\u2019s called human decency.", "NTA. You actively asked and had no objections. And you were being honest about your situation. She was being cranky and suspicious.", "NTA- you asked several times. Her time to object was before you went into the stall not after. Also, it's really weird she wanted to see the blood.", "NTA Absolutely NTA. Ignore her, nobody else said anything because they all get it. Anyone judging you is an Ah.\n\nFor anyone else reading this though, if you have a small child and there's a line do exactly what OP did. Everyone will get it, nobody wants a child to wet their pants in a line. Just do it.", "NTA, you let people know and they were cool with it. That lady's the AH.", "You asked. No one objected. NTA\n\nThat lady was being very rude, though.", "NTA. But maybe prepare a little better. White shorts when you know you\u2019re gonna be out all day in public knowing that the toilet situation is gonna be busy because it\u2019s a holiday? Not a very smart idea. \n\nThose period underwear are great for times like these. You can still wear a tampon then wear the underwear too. Then if you leak a little you\u2019re fine. It\u2019s always good to think ahead and be prepared. \n\nThe woman was out of line for how demanding she was and rude. She shouldn\u2019t have cornered you or berated you and she\u2019s an ass for doing that. But I also understand that standing in a 30-40 people line she\u2019s probably already waited a long time and maybe her kid was super desperate. She wasn\u2019t right for how she handled it and you are NTA, you just failed to plan properly but I\u2019m sure you will think next time.", "You are definitely NTA.\n\nAs you said, there were no objections, she had a chance to talk and decided to keep it to the last minute when nobody is even thinking about it anymore.ALSO it is out of line for her to ask that!! That\u2019s degrading, if there were people who urged you forward, she\u2019s definitely the odd one out with this selfish mindset. If anything, SHE is the asshole.", "Nta. You don\u2019t owe some rando any proof. Everyone else in line completely understood and were empathetic and you already disclosed more than enough private information to everyone.", "I would have simply asked her what her problem in life was and if she was the \"Period Monitor\" appointed at the venue. Also invited her to - inspect the discarded tampon or accompany you to the bathroom to inspect the stained shorts - in an extremely loud voice so at least 15-20 ppl heard. \n\nNTA", "NTA for asking to cut, but come on.  White shorts and a tampon alone when you're on your period at a festival where restroom lines are always ridiculously long? Use some common sense.\n\nI probably would have gone into the Men's room honestly.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have to says though, I would not be wearing white if there was any likelihood of being caught in a bathroom queue.", "NTA for cutting, (especially when you asked) because I don\u2019t care what color you\u2019re wearing, bleeding through your clothes is miserable. I do feel like wearing white shorts while on your period and relying on public restrooms is asking for trouble, though. It\u2019s just not worth the risk.", "NTA - Good grief.", "NTA. And a panty liner + tampon seems to work the best", "NTA.  Every single woman in that line has experienced what you experienced.  The woman was being a jerk because you had the sense to ask to cut the line, and she did not.  She also waited to attack you until after the fact which also makes her an AH.  Please know that you did nothing wrong!  Been there, done that.", "Nah, you\u2019re fine. NTA", "NTA, and that lady is wack. Who demands to see the blood?!", "NTA", "ESH because you should know better than to wear white with a tampon and no pantyliner/thin pad, especially at a large event where there will be bathroom lines like that. You may have asked to cut, but the way you did didn't really give anyone who might have not wanted to shout out their business in a crowd a chance to say no, did it?  Hearing no objections is not the same as getting consent from *everyone* you were cutting in front of. \n\nThat said, the real AHs here are the event organizers who *always* seem to fail to provide enough bathroom facilities for the number of women attending.", "ESH", "NTA since you asked and nobody complained.  The white shorts were not the smartest move if your periods are fairly strong, but sh\\*\\*t happens, you are not an AH for trying to fix it.\n\nYou can even use  men's in emergency", "NTA because you asked and people agreed.  She could have asked for people to let her 5 year old cut the line.\n\nThat lady is an AH for asking ''where is the blood'' wtf!?", "YTA. She was right... White shorts?! Come on...", "NTA\n\nAnd if her kid really, really needed to go, she could have asked to cut the line on behalf of her kid. Most adults can understand that small children can't predict the need for bathroom visits as adults can, and will gladly let a child cut the line if it means they won't pee their pants. \n\nI'm sure there  are people who would take advantage of this, but mostly I don't want a small kid peeing themselves or a fellow woman having a period accident. Basic human kindness.", "YTA and I don't get all these NTA. But it seems like I'll be downvoted to hell. You asked 3x down the line of 30+ people? That means you cut 27 people without asking them....any single person saying no should have been where you stopped. There were children in line, and I'm sure people with bladder/bowel issues who really needed to go. \n\n\nYou're an adult. You knew you were on your period, you knew you were wearing white shorts, you knew you were going somewhere crowded. Wear a panty line or pad with the tampon. Go change it earlier than you think you need to to account for a long bathroom line.", "YTA. People were waiting. What happens if a kid pees themselves now?", "NTA. Every person who menstruates has been there and knows how uncomfortable that is. I would have gladly let you cut. Periods are so unpredictable. And it\u2019s not your fault for wearing white. You took a chance lol we\u2019ve all been there. That lady was just being a jerk.", "NTA - as you said, many of the Women were understanding and agreed. Some people are selfish and have no compassion.", "YTA but only because you didn\u2019t tell her to mind her own business. \n\nApart from that. NTA", "NTA.  One of the things that still gives me hope for people is there are certain things 99% of people will understand when it comes to the unfortunate necessities caused by our bodies.  It's one thing we have in common and can empathize with.    I am glad most of the people in the line could show that there were good people who were willing to accept what you said.   Ignore the one person that was having a cranky time.   You said she had a young son - as a guy I'd not have blinked if she'd called into the mens room and asked if it was OK for her to escort her son into a stall.   It's the barest minimum we can do for each other.", "NTA", "If she had issues she should have said when you asked smh\n\nWould have deserved it if you pulled your pants down to show her the blood imo\n\nNta", "I feel like this is just women\u2019s \u201ccode\u201d that we all just know to practice.  NTA", "NTA. You even asked if people would mind before skipping the line.", "NTA. Hard to comprehend how a fellow woman could be so vile to you, assuming she's been there at some point in our lives - besides which, anyone can need to make an emergency bathroom dash, for any number of reasons. Sorry you were bullied by this inappropriately angry person!", "NTA because of emergency but a light y. T.  a for wearing white unless you weren\u2019t expecting your period when you packed.", "NTA\n\nMake sure to wear a panty liner with your tampon", "NTA - as a female I would absolutely let a woman go in front of me in that situation! I\u2019d also make sure she had pads/tampons/etc and I\u2019d also let you borrow the tide to go pen in my purse. I\u2019m sorry that lady reacted that way to you!!", "Exactly as others have said, NTA. You did ask, and multiple times, and I\u2019m sure if someone else asks on the future you would extend them the same courtesy- bathroom karma.", "Well you wore white shorts on your shark week, that wasnt smart but the lady is definitely the AH to verbally abuse you for it and was probably just cranky cause shes at a big event with a small child so is probably on edge but doesnt mean she can take it out of anybody she likes.", "After she pushed me for a long enough, I asked her if she actually wanted to see, and she said no because \"there were children in here and no one needs to see that\".", "I'd have pulled down my pants and shown it(in a there, happy now? Way). Honestly, the nerve to ask for evidence!\n\nNTA.", "She could have taken her son in the men\u2019s room", "Everyone else in line completely understood and were empathetic and you already disclosed more than enough private information to everyone.", "\u201cshark week\u201d \ud83d\ude02", "Ha - that's one way to shut the unhinged woman up.\n\nNTA.", "Props to you for asking her because it\u2019s obvious that her only goal was to make you feel bad.", "Wow...she was way out of line.\n\nNTA.", "Hehe.. out of line. \n\nAlso NTA OP, you made every effort to deal with the emergency in a respectful way to the others in line. That Mum, while likely annoyed at the situation (the long line, not you) like many others who were waiting their turn to do their business, took her frustration out on the wrong person and in an entirely inappropriate way."]}
