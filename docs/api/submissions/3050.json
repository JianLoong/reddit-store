Her and my stepdad were very controlling and frankly mean to me in my teenage years, I\u2019ve learned to just love her from a distance and have no contact with stepdad. One example to illustrate our relationship: when I was 19 I was home from uni and my parents went on a weekend trip, I asked to have one of my highschool friends over and they agreed. At some point my stepdad messaged me asking if we can go back to the living room because he can\u2019t see us in the security cameras and he wants to see what we\u2019re doing. My friend was so uncomfortable she apologized profusely and said she didn\u2019t want to stay there for the night, which I completely understood. Didn\u2019t talk to her much after that. I told my mom how embarrassing and inappropriate that was later that week and she took his side and said they believe I have a boyfriend and turned it into a lecture on how I\u2019m irresponsible (I did not have a boyfriend but even if I did\u2026 I was 19?). That\u2019s one example of many, they did a lot of damage in my formative years.\n\nMy moms salary is 3x my stepdads and 1.5x mine. He lives way beyond their means so they don\u2019t have savings. His most recent purchase is a 6k meat smoker that my mom specifically told him not to buy but he bought anyways\u2026 just to give you an idea.\n\nMom recently bought a house that she can only afford if she sells her old house. It\u2019s been on the market 2 months because my stepdad refuses to accept an offer below a certain number (1.7mil). She asked me to help cover the down payment of the new place because they will lose their deposit if it falls through. I loaned her all my liquid savings - 45k. She says it\u2019s not enough and is asking me to take money out of my investments or to refinance my mortgage to help her. I left her on read and now she is listing out all the money she has spent on me from birth. I want to tell her I\u2019m not responsible for her poor financial planning but arguing with her brings up so much trauma and I\u2019d rather just do what she wants so she leaves me alone.\n\nWIBTA for continuing to leave her on read?", "created_utc": 1669206943, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z2o0j2/wibta_for_not_loaning_my_mom_money/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Meaning her freaking responsibility as a parent? Good grief, it's a wonder how you have a good head on your shoulders.", "NTA\n\nI was recently on the verge of being homeless because I lost my job due to having medical problems. My employers didn\u2019t really know that because it would not have changed anything. So I\u2019m trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong with me. \n\nIn the meantime I was talking to my daughter\u2019s SO. She started thinking out loud how much money she had and if was enough to help me. I just interrupted a bit to say no, no no, I\u2019m not going to borrow money from you. It didn\u2019t feel right at all. Now had she been extremely wealthy and had way more money then maybe I would take it. But even then, it would feel weird.\n\nThat being said sometimes I had to borrow money from my daughter but it was more like $10 or something. She said she charged a $5 fee and even if I borrowed $5 I would have to pay back $10. I told her that sounded fair to me. But I was extremely rare and it was always for something that she needed to like electric or food. It made me feel horrible. This was right after the economy tanked in 2008-2009. \n\nNow all of the experts are saying that is going to happen again. So loaning money at this time,most especially for real estate would be a terrible thing right now. If you need to tell your mom about that and tell her you found a quiz on the internet that would tell you if you can afford that right now and the result was no. This would not be a lie, because we are the test. But I bet they have a real quiz online just for this.", "As a general rule of thumb I never loan someone more money than I\u2019m willing to give them. If I were you that number would be $20.

Leave her on read forever. The money she spent on you is because she decided to have a child. It's on her. But you already know how unfair she is.

As for the 45K you lent, I am quite sure They're lost but don't go any further with them.", "NTA. You probably won't get your 45k back from her. Please don't give her any more money.

I\u2019ve loaned them money and they felt entitled and didn\u2019t want to pay me back for stupid reasons like I raised you.

I have no idea why you gave her 45k in the first place, but that was your choice.

Have them sign over the second property to you and you'll consider it.", "YTA for not answering. \n\nIt's totally legit for you to make the choice to not loan your mother more money - it sounds like you've supported their poor financial choice with an almost ruinous level of generosity of your own. \n\nYou don't have to engage. In the broader situation your mom and stepfather sound like AHs. But she needs to know what her financial position is, and you can tell her. Leaving her hanging is cruel - it gives her hope. The fact that you're doing it to avoid the drama is understandable. But just tell her \"I already gave you everything I can give you. I can't take the kind of risk you're asking me to take by giving you any more. I'm sorry, but I can't\". Then you can leave her on read all you want.

But what the hell? Stand firm. Maybe send them a basic household budgeting book or something to be cheeky.", "BTW, they don\u2019t have to sell the house.
