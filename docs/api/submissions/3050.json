I have no contact with stepdad other than seeing him during family gatherings 2/3x a year. One example to illustrate our relationship: when I was 19 I was home from uni and my parents went on a weekend trip, I asked to have one of my highschool friends over and they agreed. At some point my stepdad messaged me asking if we can go back to the living room because he can\u2019t see us in the security cameras and he wants to see what we\u2019re doing. My friend was so uncomfortable she apologized profusely and said she didn\u2019t want to stay there for the night, which I completely understood. Didn\u2019t talk to her much after that. I told my mom how embarrassing and inappropriate that was later that week and she took his side and said they believe I have a boyfriend and turned it into a lecture on how I\u2019m irresponsible (I did not have a boyfriend but even if I did\u2026 I was 19?).

It\u2019s been on the market 2 months because my stepdad refuses to accept an offer below a certain number (1.7mil). She asked me to help cover the down payment of the new place because they will lose their deposit if it falls through. I loaned her all my liquid savings - 45k. She says it\u2019s not enough and is asking me to take money out of my investments or to refinance my mortgage to help her. I left her on read and now she is listing out all the money she has spent on me from birth.

My employers didn\u2019t really know that because it would not have changed anything. So I\u2019m trying to figure out what\u2019s wrong with me. \n\nIn the meantime I was talking to my daughter\u2019s SO. She started thinking out loud how much money she had and if was enough to help me. I just interrupted a bit to say no, no no, I\u2019m not going to borrow money from you. It didn\u2019t feel right at all. Now had she been extremely wealthy and had way more money then maybe I would take it. But even then, it would feel weird.\n\nThat being said sometimes I had to borrow money from my daughter but it was more like $10 or something. She said she charged a $5 fee and even if I borrowed $5 I would have to pay back $10. I told her that sounded fair to me. But I was extremely rare and it was always for something that she needed to like electric or food. It made me feel horrible. This was right after the economy tanked in 2008-2009. \n\nNow all of the experts are saying that is going to happen again. So loaning money at this time,most especially for real estate would be a terrible thing right now.
