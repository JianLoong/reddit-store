We married last year.\n\nI didn\u2019t come out to my dad until I was 18 and he didn't take it well. Luckily I moved away shortly after, so I suppose he focussed on missing me instead of my sexuality. But there have been bumps along the way.\n\nFor example, I once posted on FB about how I was planning a Valentine's Day treat for the guy I was seeing, and he stopped speaking to me. And when I proposed to my husband, again, he stopped speaking to me. In fact, I was with my husband for five years before the two of them even met.\n\nMy husband's family on the other hand, have always been welcoming to me. I was invited to family occasions and treated almost as another son.\n\nMy husband and I both relocated to another country in 2015. And this is where we obviously decided to get married.\n\nInitially we set a date for 2020, but then some big global event happened. I can't remember the details, but there was some reason no one was flying to other countries or attending celebrations. Throughout all the rescheduling, both sets of parents had been invited to attend, along with all of my husband's siblings and their spouses and children. During this time, by FiL got very sick and was unable to travel. But we were gonna make it work with some kind of Zoom setup, so he could witness it. Unfortunately, a few months before the wedding, he died as a result of his illness.\n\nMy husband\u2019s family attended the wedding, along with a lot of our friends, and we all had a great day. My FiL's absence was obviously felt and there were a few emotional moments. My parents, on the other hand, did not attend. I half-expected my father to not be there, but my mother had always been ok with my sexuality and had met my husband and gotten on really well with him. So for the both of them not to show up was something of a disappointment. But choices were made, their absence was noted, but we didn't let it ruin our day.\n\nBefore the wedding, I'd actually been considering legally changing my surname to match my husband. This was primarily to cement our relationship and mark us as \"family\" and in a way, to honour the memory of my FiL. And, I'd be lying if I said that my parents absence on the actual day wasn't enough to tip the balance.\n\nWell, the paperwork was finalised a week ago and I now legally share my husband's surname. I posted a picture of part of the document on the family group chat (Yes, I'm in THEIR family group chat) and everyone was really happy. Part of me was going to be a coward and not tell my parents about it, but in the end I took the plunge and went for it. It went about as well as you'd expect. And true to form, my parents haven't spoken to me since.\n\nNow, I don't regret changing the name. But maybe I could've gone about it a bit more openly with regards to them? Maybe I could've told them about it while it was still in the \"considering\" stage, instead of spring it on them once it was done?\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681313044, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12jpl1y/aita_for_legally_changing_my_name/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are the ones that chose their prejudice over loving their son and being there for you. You should not be the one who has to put in the effort to share things about your life with them when they have made it clear they do not support you. You do not need to seek approval or provide respect to people who do not respect you or your relationship.\n\nAlso it's extremely common for people to change their names when they get married, even men. This isn't some radical thing you've done by changing your last name", "Definitely NTA. It's just a name.\n\n Unless like, you went from an easy to spell name like Smith to a Polish last name. 73 letters with only two vowels and a lot of weird letters......

I\u2019m sorry your family is this way. Your husband\u2019s family is clearly your actual family. Changing your last name to theirs is the right thing to do and I think it\u2019s sweet of you.", "NTA. You've done everything you can to try with your parents and if they don't want anything to do with you or your husband, than why keep a surname to a family you don't feel you belong to.\n\nAlso, congratulations on your marriage!", "NTA - They didn't even have the decency to show up at their own son's wedding, and they have the gall to get upset over one half of a married couple taking the other half's name?  That's what married couples do. It's not surprising. It's not disrespectful.  Pretending your son doesn't exist all because of who he chooses to love *IS* disrespectful.    \n  \nMaybe one day your parents will regret their hurtful actions and accept you and your husband for who you are.

Everyone who tried discussing it first was berated and blackmailed into not doing it, but still wanted to. it isn't a good idea to try to discuss it first. It is one of those where you just have to do what you are comfortable with.  I changed my name too and my mother was furious. Screamed at me called me a liar. Said I couldn't possibly have changed my name otherwise my passport, bank account and driver's licence would have changed. I showed my drivers licence to prove yes, it was legal. Every birthday and Christmas she would write a card with my old name in it and write me a cheque in my old name that I couldn't cash. Real passive aggressive stuff. Some people cannot be pleased and it is no use trying. You have your own life to live and let them live theirs. My only regret was making too mild a change, wish I had been bolder.
