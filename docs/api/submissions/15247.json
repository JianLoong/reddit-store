You need nutrition, and it has to be carefully prepared and all the ingredients checked so you can eat it without making yourself ill.

It was quite a selfish move if there wasn't enough for two.", "NTA for sure!", "NTA.", "NTA   \nYou have a health condition that requires you to follow a certain diet. In this situation you had no other options on what to eat, he had! It is inconsiderate and childish of him to eat your food and then make a big deal out of it when he got reprimanded for it. You need to have hard set boundaries, and he needs to respect them. You have an illness that severely impacts your diet, this isn't about sharing but survival.", "NTA", "NTA. Sorry but he shouldn't have respected you enough to remember that you have a good intolerance and didn't get to eat much of what you would like to. He still had his pizza and he could have eaten that instead.", "NTA.\n\nThat was thoughtless of him; the proper response would have been to apologize for just grabbing your food.\n\nYou obviously didn't \"overreact\"; if anything, you *under* reacted, because the asshole still thinks he wasn't wrong.", "NTA. I\u2019m still salty about a family event a decade ago where my parents served lobster and clams to all the adults and ordered some chicken tenders for the toddlers. They said they\u2019d order me chicken too (I can\u2019t eat shellfish) but they forgot. On the day, everyone is sitting at the table, gushing about the food and my parent\u2019s generosity, and I ate a roll and quietly watched to see if the kids would leave any chicken available. Two chicken strips were left, so I put them on my plate and sat back down and my (then) husband turned to me  from his plate full of seafood and said \u201c Oh, can I have one?\u201d as he took one from my plate. I was trying not to draw attention as I hissed that this was all I had to eat, but it was too late once the chicken touched all the shells on his plate.", "I do think the alcohol had a big part to play in his reaction and not thinking he did anything wrong. I plan to bring it up later and I'm sure he will admit it was unfair.", "I agree it was thoughtless, we'd both had a bit to drink, and I don't think he was thinking clearly about the consequences for me. \n\nI can be quite possessive of my food so I worried I was overdoing it. I plan to bring it up later and have a sober conversation where I'm sure he will apologize.", "I feel your pain. I've been left out and forgotten when it comes to food so many times.

So NTA, he should have asked.", "NTA", "NTA.", "The Gluten thing is completely irrelevant.  This is Food War material!   You've got to draw battle lines and defend your meal!  Any couple has experienced this and if you let them take a fry, next time it's half the burger!  Make a stand and watch them drool while you eat your Steak!", "NTA\n\nI'm very possessive of my food. I don't share. And I don't even have a solid reason! Lol. I think it's okay for people to be off put by sharing period.", "NTA, he should have asked even if you had not been gluten intolerant and you would have the right to just say no.", "NTA. People like this don\u2019t limit their entitlement to just food. Has he done this before? Does he criticize how you spend your money?", "NTA", "Agreed! Eskom sucks.", "Feel so bad for both of you, I couldn\u2019t even imagine being so rude to someone who I know has intolerances.", "NTA you are right to be concerned about the selfishness of someone who would eat your food, their food and leave you hungry because there was nothing else.

Instead of being an equal partnership and where he considers you needs as well as his own, he will be putting himself and his own needs first. yours will come second, or in this case, not at all.", ">He thinks I'm TA and overreacted because it was just one tiny piece of steak\n\nYou only have five of those, wtf is his point?          \nHe's self defeating with just that one \"point\" alone because he knows your dinner is tiny yet still takes from you?         \n         \nNTA, he's an asshole.", "NTA.

I don't understand how all these supposed adults on reddit thinks its perfectly okay to just grab someone else's food from their plate without asking. Do that to me and you're getting a fork to the hand. I bet you won't try it a second time. Especially with your intolerences.... sheesh. I would NEVER reach over and grab even one little french fry off my husband's plate without asking, then receiving permission. Manners people, manners.", "NTA.  But definitely marriage material.  Not.", "This is not going to work. NTA but he doesn't respect you.", "NTA - wish people knew what intolerances or food allergies are like.

Maybe have a discussion with him at length on why the situation bothered you", "NTA tell him to order enough to eat next time the power is gonna be out.", "NTA but y\u2019all need to order more food when you\u2019re out drinking.

This. OP, if he does this regularly, when you go to order, say, \"BLANK, I'm going to eat all of this. If you want some, can you order yourself some?\" \"Are you sure you don't want any?\" If he ends up trying to take some later, it's a power play, pure and simple, and this guy isn't a nice guy.\n\nI eat a very specific diet and my husband never asks for my food, but I DO offer it when I have more than enough. My gut says your guy is not a keeper.", "and it would have been more than \"one tiny piece\" if she hadn't stopped him."]}
