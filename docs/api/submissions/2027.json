My parents were very dedicated to their religion and they always did their best to ensure that we followed the ways of religion. They believed that if we weren\u2019t obedient to the religion that it would mean an eternity separated from family and in hell. This made having any other belief very difficult growing up.\n\nI am 5 of 8 kids. I have 3 brothers and 4 sisters. In my life I did try to help my parents to start become more lax for my younger siblings so that my younger siblings could have more of an option to choose how they wanted to worship. This meant a lot of conversations where I had to defend how my younger siblings believed. I had my relationship with my siblings threatened to be severed on me more than once for believing differently than my parents did - so I always had to be careful of not going too far in this convincing and I ultimately had to stop talking against their church in front of my siblings in order to keep the relationship with them.\n\nIn January, my youngest brother passed in a tragic accident. In his life he always thanked me for always defending his atheist beliefs even amongst the cruelty caused by the consequences of my parents afterwards. During the funeral proceedings I did my best to be tolerant of the religious beliefs and let people grieve how it was best for them and didn\u2019t say anything for: the religious sermons, the prayers, and for the dedication of his grave that ultimately condemned my brother for his choices in life for his being a non-believer.\n\nThe straw that broke the camels back for me is that my family were trying to plan behind my back for putting my brother\u2019s name through their temple despite him always being outspoken about his atheist beliefs to them. I know atheism doesn\u2019t care much for an afterlife but the idea that they are so willing and ok with not honoring his memory the way he would want it to be is just too painful a blow for me.\n\nAs a result, I told my family exactly how I felt about the matter and several of my siblings agreed with me. My parents are telling me that I\u2019m the Asshole for bringing this up and for trying to get in the way of their grieving and that there is the belief in their religion that he can choose to decline the services performed on his behalf. I told them my view of how he already made it clear in his life about how he felt about religion and that this was a disgrace to his memory.\n\nMy parents are now telling the rest of the family that I am an asshole for not letting them grieve the way they need to and for putting a damper on the day they performed the ceremony on his behalf just because I believe differently. They think I should have kept my mouth shut and not have said anything so that my family could grieve and not have said anything because my brother is no longer around.

If your brother has no hope of return and is nothing more than a body in the ground, what possible effect does it have on him? Surely the comfort it will bring them must vastly outweigh the zero inconvenience to your brother. \n\nThe only thing I can think of is if it is *significantly* distressing to you siblings who do not believe to have this ceremony. But I would strongly encourage you to examine your beliefs and see if there is not any wiggle room to indulge your parents having their fairy stories in the knowledge it has zero effect on your brother.
