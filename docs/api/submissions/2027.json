In his life he always thanked me for always defending his atheist beliefs even amongst the cruelty caused by the consequences of my parents afterwards. During the funeral proceedings I did my best to be tolerant of the religious beliefs and let people grieve how it was best for them and didn\u2019t say anything for: the religious sermons, the prayers, and for the dedication of his grave that ultimately condemned my brother for his choices in life for his being a non-believer.\n\nThe straw that broke the camels back for me is that my family were trying to plan behind my back for putting my brother\u2019s name through their temple despite him always being outspoken about his atheist beliefs to them. I know atheism doesn\u2019t care much for an afterlife but the idea that they are so willing and ok with not honoring his memory the way he would want it to be is just too painful a blow for me.\n\nAs a result, I told my family exactly how I felt about the matter and several of my siblings agreed with me. My parents are telling me that I\u2019m the Asshole for bringing this up and for trying to get in the way of their grieving and that there is the belief in their religion that he can choose to decline the services performed on his behalf.

And, completely coincidentally, in order to be worthy to go to the temple you have to give the church 10% of your income and regularly verify that you're obeying all their rules. Growing up I used to babysit for people who went to the temple once a week and that was their ONLY time away from their kids. A lot of Mormon practices are about keeping the members so busy that they have no time to build a life outside the church"]}
