She came 6 weeks early and was only 4 pounds and 4 ounces. She spent a few weeks in the NICU because she had to get an NG tube to help her eat since she couldn't figure out how to on her own yet. She had the tube in for 2 weeks before she figured it out, and then had the tube removed a week later. The whole time she was in the NICU, my 23 year old brother wanted to come meet her. \n\nSome background on my brother before going forward: he's in active addiction right now and is homeless living in the woods. I empathize with his situation, because I also used to be very heavily into drugs (I'm clean now), but my family and I have done everything in the world that's possible to get him help so he can be sober and live a normal life. My pop alone has gotten him two jobs, a car, paid for a hotel room, had paid for rehab. He spits in our faces everytime to the point where only my mom and I speak to him now. \n\nAnyways, when he first asked to visit, I used the excuse that she couldn't have visitors in the NICU except for her father and I, which wasn't true but I didn't want to hurt my brothers feelings.\n\nShe's been home for a few months now, and I've been dodging his requests to meet her left and right. Finally tonight he demanded to know why I won't let him meet her, and I finally relented and told him why: I don't want my daughter to be around people in active addiction. Also, because he's homeless, he doesn't shower very much and is always sick with something or another. I don't want him around her if he's physically dirty and sick. And honestly, if I did let him visit, I know that he would try to hit me up for money. \n\nHe was absolutely furious about it, and told me that I'm a shitty sister and a hypocrite since I used to use drugs too. He told me that if I think that I'm so much better than him, that he didn't want me in his life and to not contact him again. Hearing that broke my heart. His girlfriend called me and ripped me a new one too, saying that I should've just told him that from the beginning instead of letting it go this far. And I think she's right, I think I might be the asshole for not just being upfront with him when she was born, but I love him. I didn't want him to think that I wasn't going to be there for him or that I don't want him to have a relationship with his niece. I would love for them to have a relationship, if he was off the drugs. I also didn't want him to be mad at me, which is what ended up happening anyways. Before writing this out I thought that I wasn't the asshole, but now that I've written it out, I definitely think I'm the asshole. What do you guys think?\n\nThanks for reading.", "created_utc": 1686894812, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14aoiut/aita_for_telling_my_brother23_that_he_cant_meet/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn\u2019t want my kid around that either.. Especially if he\u2019s homeless and getting sick constantly, it would put your newborn in harms way for sure. It\u2019s best for him to get better first before meeting your child.", "NTA \n\nYou probably should have told him from the start that he needs to get clean (in all ways) before he can have a relationship with niece, though as someone already said the reaction would probably have been the same.\n\nWho knows, this might have one day be the kick in the rump to get clean. That being said it isn\u2019t your responsibility to give him said kick in the butt, it\u2019s your responsibility to protect the wee baby (congratulations btw) and you are doing just that.", "Nta. I went through something pretty similar with my brother. He\u2019s an alcoholic and I told him when I was pregnant he would never be allowed near my kid and he hung up on me. Decade later, we still don\u2019t talk and the only time he\u2019s seen my kid was at a family funeral and he was told he wasn\u2019t allowed to speak to me and the rest of my family made sure he stuck with it. One member checks up on him periodically and he\u2019s still drinking to this day. \n\nThat being said, I don\u2019t regret it. Your child is the priority and it\u2019s your job to protect them. No parent is perfect, and our past mistakes are just lessons to pass on to our children to help them avoid making the same ones. You should have told him sooner but I can understand why you didn\u2019t. Losing family is hard but you can\u2019t trust kids around addicts in most circumstances.", "No, NTA. As a parent I understand. And honestly, the sickness is enough of a reason to not have him around her. Preemies are often more susceptible to respiratory illness. \n\nIf there is ever a period of time while he is well, if you want, you could offer to have him over to shower and he could meet her. He doesn't need to necessarily hold her just to see her. BUT. I also think it's totally reasonable to have a boundary that you don't want people who are actively using to be around her either.", "NTA.\n\nProtecting your child from him is your utmost responsibility as a parent and you are doing the right thing.\n\nThere wasnt going to be an amicable solution regarding telling him -  it wouldve ended up in the same place. He'd still be upset.\n\nKeep to your word. If he gets clean, allow him slowly to build a relationship with baby. He doesn't? No relations. It is NOT worth the risk, baby will form a relationship and be upset if he isn't consistent.\n\nWell done. Youre doing the right thing.\n\nEdit: just re-read post and sounds like rehab and familial love hasn't had its desired effect - the polar opposite. Furthermore, the way he spoke about YOU doing the right thing and told you not to contact him again only leads me even more to the point that this man does not deserve any part in your babys life. \n\nFuck him and his actions.", "NTA, \n\nYour job is to protect your child, not your brothers feelings. Every reason you don't want him around is completely valid. His logic that because you were an addict means he should get to be around is ridiculous. That's exactly why he shouldn't. Typically, when you're a recovered addict, you stay away from active users to not temp yourself or risk relapse.  \n\nYou are an ass for not being up front and dragging him along. But it's not like you were doing it to be mean or anything", "NTA \n\nSick and dirty people have no place around kids - family or otherwise. \n\nTell him to get clean (from drugs and physically) and then he can meet her. \n\nMaybe that can be a catalyst for change? (I assume he doesn't *want* to do drugs and live in the woods).", "YTA, not for not letting him meet his niece, but for dragging it out letting him think it was going to happen. He might\u2019ve had the same reaction, but that\u2019s his own problem for being in the situation he\u2019s in", "NTA. You need to put your daughter first and your concerns are valid.\nI understand that you don\u2019t want to hurt him, yes you could have told him sooner, but in the grand scheme of things \u2026 he ca get over it and maybe it is a wake up call.\nWish you the best and I hope he can get out of this bad spot.", "NTA in any way. He needs to address his many issues before he earns contact with your child. Actually, the fact that he is so adamant about it is a bit disturbing.", "NTA", "NTA. My mom lives down the street. She doesn't see my kids because she's an addict. I lie to her all the time about why I won't bring them by because I know that if I lie, she'll be mad and if I tell the truth, she'll be so mad that she'll be dangerous.", "NTA. But maybe positioning it differently would help. Instead of telling him all the reasons he ***can't*** see her, instead explain that you would absolutely love him to have a relationship with your daughter, but a condition of that is that he gets himself clean and his life stabilized, and ultimately that is his choice.", "Sort of the A hole. I agree you should have told him up front. But honestly his reaction would have been about the same.", "I'm going to go with a soft YTA here, and only on part of it.  \nYou should have been up front with him about it instead of lying. I understand that you wanted to avoid confrontation, but it was inevitable that it would happen eventually.  \nYou are absolutely right about not letting him visit your child though. He could get her sick.  \nI hope your brother gets over his addiction though. Maybe this will be one of the catalysts that makes him decide to get help and try to stick with it this time. It's a rough road that I have helped a few people walk.  \nI'm sure you'll let him visit if he turns things around, gets clean and gets his ducks in a row, so just make sure that once you apologize for not being up front with him, you let him know that your door will open up for visits with your daughter.  \nBTW, even though I'm a stranger in the Reddit-verse, I'm proud of you for being able to walk away from the drugs you used to do.", "YTA, the baby is 3 months old\u2026 how is he gonna influence her life on anything at such a young age?? At the hospital he could have worn a n95 or a regular mask for sickness also could have showered for free and you could have witnessed it. I personally think you\u2019re the asshole because you didn\u2019t tell him from the jump! \n\nWhen my sister was pregnant, she made a proposal to my oldest sister that order to be an active auntie, she needed to get clean and once that baby was born she became sober and has been for the last 6 years. Who\u2019s to say he wouldn\u2019t have done the same\u2026", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

After all, this is your child and it's your responsibility to make the decisions you feel are in his or her best interests. No-one else matters in the same way. Congrats on getting clean, having your little one and I wish you the very best of luck and good fortune going forwards!", "NTA, you want to keep your child out of the hospital which is 100% the right decision especially since she was in there for so long. That being said you shouldn\u2019t have lied to him about your reasoning although his girlfriend is wrong because it wouldn\u2019t have changed anything from his side of things and if anything he may have tried to come to the hospital and cause further issues there to see her", "NTA The continuing support he is getting from his family seems to be reinforcing his addiction, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codependency.", "Extremely soft YTA or ESH, I think this could have been handled better", "I don't know that it's an \"AH\" move, but avoiding the plain truth to an active addict, as you know, rarely helps them. Soft YTA", "I was really hoping he'd have it together by now. I was hoping I wouldn't have to keep brushing him off and that he'd come to me saying he's ready to get clean. And now I think that even when he is ready, he won't come to me now because of this and now I feel guilty. He was my ride or die for so long and the drugs just tore us apart. I hate drugs so much.", "Thank you. I just can't squash this overwhelming sense of guilt. The boy has been my ride or die since the day he was born, and it just breaks my heart that our relationship has come to this. I miss the old him.", "I  actually have let him come over, shower and eat in the past  But now he's unfortunately no longer allowed at my house. I live with my boyfriend and his family while we save up for our own place, and he showed up high out of his mind when I was 2 months pregnant screaming about how we stole his drugs. My boyfriend's parents banned him after that.", "Agreed, plus I don\u2019t know why some always think they have a right to people\u2019s kids. Children aren\u2019t communal property.", "Our family has done so much to try to help him. It breaks my heart every time it doesn't work. I miss how he used to be. The whole situation is just so sad and I'm left feeling more guilty than ever.", "You'd think that, but we've all offered him an actual roof over his head if he just stops using.. he doesn't like to follow the rules of any house he's in, which has resulted in him being kicked out of multiple places. You can't help someone who doesn't want it, but my god I want to shove help down his throat so bad. I hope that maybe he'll change, but in reality I know he won't until he's ready to stop living the way he's living.", "I tried to tell him that when I was pregnant, but anytime I talk about bettering himself it goes in one ear and out the other. He also knows that I could never cut him out completely because I love him, so to have him say he doesn't want to hear from me anymore literally crushed my soul. I feel so guilty and keep thinking that maybe I should've just let him meet her.", "I think so too, but now I'm just left with what ifs. The biggest being what if I had just been honest in the beginning and he told me that he wanted to change things? I know it's not a strong possibility but my brain just went straight to that.", "He\u2019s an addict. He is willfully homeless and doesn\u2019t have proper hygiene. She would be insane to let this guy around her child.", "Your right. I just wanted to protect him but all I did was make it worse.", "You should probably talk to him again. I was also an addict and Ive been dealing for years with guilt cause of how I acted towards family and how selfish I was so maybe im biased, but I get it. People simplify things on here but in reality, relationships are complex and good people end up in bad situations, doing bad things. Doing drugs messes with your emotions and perception, and he probably cant understand where youre coming from and feels unfairly judged, even tho its not realistic. Youre not in the wrong here, at all. But if your goal is to make amends, make sure hes aware youre being careful and not just purely judgemental, or punishing him, and that it hurts you just as well to make those decisions. Maybe your choice of avoiding telling him upfront made it seem like youre indifferent to it? Idk. I hope everything works out and maybe its a start of a new chapter for him as well. Best of luck!", "That's true too. He never used to be this way before the drugs though. I hate what they have turned him into.", "Your brother played shitty games and won shitty prizes. \n\nNone of it is your fault. You didn't force him to use drugs, it was his choice, and he continues to use which is also his choice. \nGetting clean isn't easy, no one said it would be.\nYou have given him several genuine incentives and he has taken your incentives with a wild dose of laxatives and shit all over them.\n\nIt isn't your fault and the guilt you feel is his own, projecting on to you because he can't bear it alone \n\n\nStay strong.", "I'm sorry. That sounds rough. \n\nBut you are right, though. Ultimately, only he can make the change. Sounds like you guys will be there when he starts trying. That's nice :) Not everyone gets that luxury.", "No, you did the right thing. Your vulnerable child should absolutely be your focus. You are not responsible for his drug addiction or for making things easier for him. Only he can decide he wants to get clean. You can absolutely love him, want the best for him, but make it clear that he cannot see your child until he is clean. Those things are not mutually exclusive. \n\nDoes he have a phone? If so, I would text him and say absolutely that. \"I love you, and I want you to be a part of <insert child's name> life. But my responsibility is to her and she has been very ill. I want the best for you and for her. I hope some day you can get clean, and I will support you however I can in that journey..\"", "Honestly just give the baby more attention. Keep yourself busy.", "NTA. Yes, you could\u2019ve told him earlier but listen, he would\u2019ve been just as mad and you were in no position right after giving birth to deal with him. \n\nYour baby was in the hospital, you had all the stress and hormones and emotions going on. You didn\u2019t need his drama too. \n\nDon\u2019t feel bad. You\u2019re doing the best you can. He will sort out his life\u2014or he won\u2019t and there\u2019s nothing you can do to change it. It\u2019s all up to him. \n\nI wish you and your little family the best. Be happy. Love that baby girl. And be gentle on yourself.", "Thank you, I think I will try to talk to him again. I love him and I want him to do better so that he can have a relationship with his niece. I'm also in constant fear that I'm going to get the call that he's dead and if that happened before were able to reconcile I would never forgive myself.", "For sure, I can relate as the person who people distanced from because they didn\u2019t want to see what was happening to me. I personally don\u2019t want to speculate on why he\u2019s taking an interest in your baby, but he definitely needs to respect your decision. Hopefully it can push him towards the help he needs to have healthy relationships with you and the rest of your family.  Good luck!", "I was born to be her mom. And my relationship with most of my family is strained. It does bother me that they won't be able to have a relationship until he's clean, but I also don't want to put her in any danger. Fentanyl is such a dangerous drug and I hate it with every fiber of my being.", "You feel guilty because you are a good person. You are just putting your child and yourself first. There is NOTHING wrong with that. \n\nSet clear expectations for the future. If he can\u2019t meet them then that\u2019s not your fault. \n\nPs NTA"]}
