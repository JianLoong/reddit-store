They are all Latino and celebrate with Latino food and traditions.\n\nIn 2022, my husband (40m) and I moved to the same city as my Dad. We decided to host Christmas at our new home this year because we have enough room and we have always wanted to host Christmas with a combination of my husband\u2019s American and my European traditions.  My brother (35m) is flying in with his wife and kids. And my husband\u2019s family is also visiting. We are planning on hosting 30 people.\n\nThe plan is to have a Christmas party with snacks and food at 9 pm then attend Christmas Service (virtually) at 11 pm. In the morning we will open Santa Claus and regular gifts, have a Christmas breakfast, followed by Christmas movies and then the traditional Christmas Dinner at 4 pm. I\u2019ve spend days preparing for Christmas dinner. (We are having the Christmas party catered as it is 30 people).\n\nI invited my Dad, Stepmom, Her sister and their adult kids as well and I was telling my Dad and stepmom today the plans and how we have been getting ready for tonight. I was then asked about the menu and criticized there was no food my stepmom and her family would eat. That they normally have Christmas dinner at midnight (Latino tradition) and open presents then.\n\nI was then asked to accommodate their traditions to which I said no. This Christmas has been planned for months and a lot of time, money and effort has gone into planning it. I said if they don\u2019t like how we do it, they don\u2019t have to come.  Now my dad told me my stepmom is at the market buying food and will be cooking her traditional food for her family and bringing it along and she\u2019s very upset.\n\nI said if she wants to do that, she\u2019s more then welcome as long as she\u2019s not in the way of the caterers tonight as the kitchen is occupied. She\u2019s now upset saying I\u2019m excluding her family. They are all adults and if they don\u2019t like it, they don\u2019t have to come.\n\nMy Dad says he feels I\u2019m making him choose and he just wants peace so he can spend time with his grandkids. I told they are more then welcome and can even bring their own food but the kitchen is off limits and we are sticking to the itinerary as is.\nNow my stepmom is threatening not to come.

I think that since you gave your step mom the option to bring her traditional food with her for the guest, she really has nothing to worry about. They will still have foods they are familiar with, and other options from the caterers to try as well. You mentioned that you have gone to you dad and step mom's home for Christmas in the past.

You said, \"I said if she wants to do that, she\u2019s more then welcome as long as she\u2019s not in the way of the caterers tonight as the kitchen is occupied.\" What part of that did she not understand? It isn't fair that your stepmom is forcing your dad to choose between her and you. You are the hostess, graciously opening up your home to 30 people. She is being tacky by forcing her own food and traditions onto everyone, when you have already spent months preparing for this special occasion. Just as bad as someone bringing a McDonald's meal to your home. Like you said, your Dad and stepmom don't have to come. If they don't, their loss.", "NTA. I think it\u2019s weird that you accept an invite to someone else\u2019s event and then say it\u2019s not good enough because my traditions aren\u2019t being met.

It doesn't matter what your menu is whatsoever! If they refuse to come that is their choice! When they host Christmas they can do it their way! They are not hosting Christmas therefore, they should respect you and not bring anything and have Christmas your way! If they can't then that's too damn bad! I could never demand someone to change their menu for me when I'm the guest it's just rude AF!

Once when I was a child I think 8 or 9 we went to her house for Christmas and I asked for something different (I wasn't really introduced to anything besides American food) and she literally lost her shit calling me rude and disrespectful and she was right I was rude and disrespectful! I ofc didn't understand any of this back then because like I said before then we always had Christmas at my grandparents and my auntie never brought over her traditional foods to my grandparents house because she knew it was distasteful and rude!", "When you go to someone else's house you go with what they are doing.

Unless it's dietary restrictions or allergy related you don't try and dictate what someone else has planned for dinner. They can go 1 night eating something different. The whole point is to celebrate with family. It doesn't matter where, what you eat etc. Step mom is being unnecessarily rude, condescending, and judgemental because she wants things her way or no way.", "Please note that \"European\" does not mean one culture...which part of Europe do you mean? Also, a grown woman can't put up with a different way of doing things for once? Pfff.

Especially knowing you wanted to have a Christmas that completely celebrated your husband's American  and mother's European tradition.

No one brought other things (unless it was at my grandparents but that's because we had a menu and everyone had to do their part especially when she got too old to do Thanksgiving on her own) when we went to my aunties no one forced her to change her menu to American food, no one makes my husbands family change their traditions to American food, no one made my grandmother change her menu to latin food, no one tries to force my father to do other traditions it's ridiculous that this women thinks OP needs to meet her traditions and trying to claim she's being left out! I wonder how many dinners she's had that OP was \"left out\" on", "Because they're still family! My aunt is Panamanian and she was still invited to my grandmother's (step dad's mother)  traditional Christmas and we didn't do Latin foods! So is she supposed to just exclude them?

When you're hosting you host as you please! She invited them, they don't have to accept! They can just stay home and do it their way! But how awful to not invite someone just because of their heritage! That's entirely inappropriate and also rude! Last I checked most people don't act like her dad and the step is! They just don't go or they go and then go home and do things their way! How disrespectful to demand someone to do things your way just for you! The step is the only one crying about it forcing OPs dad to choose between them! The step needs to grow up! I bet money the step has never included foods that OP would like to see at her dinners and I bet OP still goes!

I bet money if she did the same thing to the \"step\" mother I promise you the \"step\" mother would lose her mind and call OP rude!

I don't understand why it would be on OP to accommodate them or even make this clear to them. OP wants to make her own Christmas traditions at her own house. If you are a guest at someone's house for the holidays, you should expect to follow their traditions. I think it was nice for OP to even offer to allow her to bring her own food. If it's that's important to celebrate holidays with your own traditions, don\u2019t agree to an invitation to someone else's house.
