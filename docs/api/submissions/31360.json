I got a list of things that she wanted but (this is where we might be the AH) I kinda let my fiance go with his gut. It was the first year he did it and I wanted him to have fun. \n\nFor context, that was also the first year we even had (informal) Christmas lists, typically we just went with our gut. It's more entertaining that way and makes it a little more personal. Like, there was a general buzz of what someone might want but nothing set in stone. \n\nMy fiance picked a few things that he thought were great. A Cheeto blanket and a water bottle (she plays sports). But not what she had said she wanted. Which I, at the time, wasn't really concerned with. He did spend a lot of time picking out the right water bottle and when he saw the blanket he just had to get it for her. And who was I to get in the way. \n\nHere's where it gets tricky. She was not happy about him not going off of her list. And they (collectively) were not quite about it either. It made my fiance feel terrible. And honestly really embarrassed me as I did not think that it was that big of a deal. We've never really had lists before. \n\nSo this year I decided that we aren't going to do it. And now they are mad again. And we are back to the old fight. \n\nETA: Our secret santa has no rules. Especially no rules regarding lists. When I said we had \"informal\" lists last year, that it was just that, informal. It was not a rule to follow the lists, it just happened to be that people were putting out lists. And even last year, we still were not getting what was on these informal lists. My fiance got a hammer and a duffel bag last year. \n\nAITA? \n\nTl;Dr\nNiece was unhappy with what my fiance got her for secret Santa, their family made a stink about it and now I'm not doing it this year and they are mad again.

She was asked to make a list, which she did, and she didn't get anything she wanted. That's disapointing to a child. You knew there was a list. Why didn't you tell your fiance to stick to it? What kid wants a Cheeto blanket or water bottle? Horrible gifts. It comes off as regifting or not caring to put effort in. They probably made lists so they wouldn't get stuck with a cheap blanket and a water bottle. But, she should have been grateful. A gift is a gift, even a bad gift. But, YTA because instead of actually sticking to the lists this year, and learning from your mistake, you just quit. That's immature. Your fiance messed up. This year, just stick to the list!", "What kind of things were on your niece\u2019s list?  Were they practical things, relpacemyfor things she already had, or fun things and luxuries?  \n\nYour niece was disappointed for a reason. She asked for, and expected, fun things. Something she didn\u2019t already have several of. \n\nYour boyfriend didn\u2019t consider what would make you our niece happy. He only considered how the gift made him feel. That\u2019s selfish and insensitive behavior. \n\nWhen boyfriend was called out for this behavior, did he apologize?  No. You acted like children, and refused to participate in the next gift exchange. \n\nAnd now you have to ask if you\u2019re the asshole? Of course you are. **You\u2019re insisting that it\u2019s not important to consider the feelings of a gift recipient when choosing a gift. You hurt a child\u2019s feelings, and refuse to apologize.**  That\u2019s definitely asshole behavior. \n\n**YTA**", "I would normally say NTA because secret santas don't matter, and if your fiance doesn't want to participate then who cares.\n\nBut.\n\nYour fiance joined a secret santa with his in-laws. He received instructions of how to participate. Everyone followed the instructions but him. Everyone got gifts they asked for, except the 12 year old niece who got ... a cheeto blanket she didn't want.\n\nYes, your fiance may have had good intentions, but it was rude to disrespect the process that everyone else had agreed to follow, and you are rude for letting this happen. Now your feelings are hurt (because they pointed out you kinda screwed over the 12 year old kid) so you are skipping it entirely. And that's your right, but yes, I think its perfectly natural for others to look down on your behavior as childish.", "ESH\n\nExcept the 12 year old. She had every right to be disappointed in what was, to her, a crappy gift. \n\nYour fiance is an AH for deciding to go off book when buying a gift for a tween girl he barely knows. I have a 12 year old niece, but I know her fairly well. I found a book she might like for Christmas, but I still ran it by her mother, just in case. \n\nYou are an AH for LETTING your fiance go off book. Yes, you say there are \"no rules,\" but I'm sure one of the guiding principles is 'get the recipient something YOU THINK they will like.' Absent any real relationship with your niece, you should have encouraged your fiance to go with the list. \n\nYou are also an AH for petulantly withdrawing from the process this year because the two of you crapped the bed last year. Maybe take this opportunity to show that the two of you have grown as people, and as family members. But instead you want to sulk. \n\nHas your 12 year old niece withdrawn from the process after she got a crappy gift last year? Or is she hoping she will get something that shows the gift giver gave some thought as to who she is as an individual human being. \n\nGrow up. The two of you screwed up last year and got called out for it. If the two of you intend to be part of the larger family unit moving forward, you need to participate in these activities, even if you're not good at them. \n\nAnd expect some Cheetos themed wedding gifts.", "YTA - I get that you aren't required to go off a list, but when a 12 year old makes a list they are going to expect something to come off of that list. Of course she was disappointed by receiving stuff that she didn't ask for. Would it have been nice for her to graciously accept, move on, and then just not use it or give to someone else? Sure, but again she's only 12. Your BF, presumably, doesn't know enough about your niece to just go off the cuff with a gift. Also, do you know how many water bottles the kid already has? She's into sports, guaranteed it's plenty. And not many 12 year old girls want Cheeto merchandise. \n\nBut what truly makes you the asshole here is because you are being petty and refusing to participate this year, all because you BF fucked up last year and didn't buy your niece a gift that she liked and, like most 12 year olds would do, she voiced her displeasure that she didn't get something on her list.", "YTA, not for refusing to do it this year, but for setting your fiance up for failure last year.\n\n\nYou say that last year was the first year people had lists. It seems like most people agreed to do lists BECAUSE they thought it was better. Your niece is 12, she expressed what she wanted, and you completely ignored that to have your fiance \"go with his gut\" for a 12 year old girl, whose family he is joining. \n\nYou're definitely N T A for not participating this year, because you don't want to participate like everyone else decided was a better way to do it.", "YTA.

And now you're the victim.\n\nYTA", "Opting out of an ostensibly fun activity -- especially if it caused hurt feelings the last time you participated -- is not only a clear NTA situation, it seems particularly prudent under the circumstances.\n\nI'm not going to give a judgment over your bf's gifting behavior last year since it really depends on nuances like how 'informal' the lists were, how appropriate the gifts would have been in prior years, and several other factors.\n\nBut regardless, your family are being AHs by pressuring him to join something that is clearly not as light-hearted as was originally claimed", "YTA.  He bought her a cheeto blanket because he just had to get it?  Why?  That's so random and unless she has a thing for chips, pretty obviously a gift she wasn't going to want.", "i don't think you're the asshole here. it's clear that last year's secret santa experience was a misunderstanding and it's unfortunate that your niece and family made a big deal out of it. it's unfair for them to expect everyone to strictly follow their lists especially when there were no set rules or guidelines. you and your fiance should be able to enjoy the gift-giving process without feeling restricted by lists. it's understandable that you decided not to participate this year to avoid any more conflicts. hopefully they can understand your perspective and move past this.", "YTA", "Yikes. 12 is definitely old enough to know how to be gracious over a gift. Though given her family\u2019s reaction, it is clear she is being raised that way. It\u2019s honestly embarrassing for them. Ick. \n\nNTA", "Isn't the purpose of the secret part of secret Santa that no one knows who gives what? So how did they know your boyfriend gave her the gifts. This year there was a list you boyfriend didn't follow it, niece was upset and that is surprising why?\n\nThis year you don't want to do it because of your own mistakes. How about you do it you keep it secret and follow the list it's actually pretty simple. Someone says please get me a b or c and then you get them d in there upset. How about get them a b or c?\n\nYta", "NTA - your fianc\u00e9 had fun with it and they got all butthurt about not getting specifically what they wanted from a list.  It\u2019s pretty entitled to give people a list for a fun event like a secret Santa.  It should be all about the thought that counts and it sounds like your fianc\u00e9 put thought and effort into finding some gifts, which is what should count.  Getting mad because someone didn\u2019t give you what you thought you were entitled to defeats the point of Christmas gift giving. \n\nI would tell your family to kick rocks about the gift exchange since they don\u2019t understand the point of it.", "NTA - I expect a 12 yo to be able to handle that kind of \"deception\" gracefully. It seems the lists were expected to be set in stone, but it wasn't communicated clearly enough. It happens, no need to be rude about it. Your family missed a teaching moment with your niece.\n\nI don't see the point of secret Santa if it's just to pick up an item off a list, but that's me. I wouldn't participate either if I was in your shoes.", "I don't get why a kid is participating in the adult secret Santa exchange between your parents and siblings, since she's none of those things? Is she the reason why lists were suddenly involved, or did someone ask her to make a list? I think she was too young to be involved in the exchange and should just receive a regular present like most young kids. I don't like anyone who gets publicly upset about receiving a present, even if it's something they don't necessarily want, they can bring that up to you privately and ask if there's a gift receipt so they could exchange it. And then the rest of your family piling on like he committed some mortal sin by being bad at present buying? Bad manners all around, and I wouldn't want to participate in that either. Also, if you're expected to buy only what's on the list, what's even the point? Everyone might as well just buy themselves a present. I'm going with NTA.", "Absolutely NTA!!\n\nLists are optional not compulsory", "NTA - typically those lists are just suggestions. The niece should have been grateful to get a present. She shouldn\u2019t have complained. How entitled.", "nta - your niece should learn to appreciate the thought and effort that went into the gifts instead of focusing on the specific items she wanted. it's not about getting exactly what you asked for it's about the sentiment behind the gifts. your decision to not do secret santa this year is completely understandable given the unnecessary drama that unfolded last time. stand your ground and don't let them guilt trip you into participating.", "NTA. What's the point of 'stick to the list'? How is that a gift? People can bloody well buy what they want for themselves at that point.", "NTA, what\u2014is that the ONLY gift she got all Christmas? Why would her parents put her entire enjoyment of the holiday in the hands of her cousin\u2019s 23 year old boyfriend? Kids (and everyone) should strive to show gratitude for the genuine thought put into gifts, and his gift was clearly thoughtful and personal. If the spirit of gift giving was that dead in my family, I wouldn\u2019t participate either. I\u2019m not even sure why they want him to participate so bad if he did such a terrible job last year.\n\nThat being said, I would try to talk this through with them and set clearer expectations for secret Santas before giving up entirely. The main issue I would not budge on is that no one is to be berated for giving a genuinely thoughtful gift.", "nta. it's understandable that you and your fiance wanted to have a more personal and entertaining approach to the secret santa exchange. your niece's reaction and the collective response from your family seems a bit excessive considering it was the first year you had lists. it was meant to be a fun experience and it shouldn't have caused such drama. taking a break from the exchange this year seems like a reasonable decision to avoid further conflict.", "Your niece throws a fit because she didn't get what she specifically wanted for a Secret Santa exchange with no set rules, and now you're caving in and not participating this year? Talk about overreacting. Your fianc\u00e9 made an effort to pick thoughtful gifts, and it's not his fault that your family decided to make a mountain out of a molehill. If they want to be mad, let them be mad. It's their problem, not yours. Your family needs to chill out and remember that gift-giving is about thoughtfulness, not sticking rigidly to lists.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA\nYou obviously didn't think people had to stick to the lists, so you didn't say anything and you both were treated like crap over it. It is completely understandable that you would not want to participate again. \n\nHowever, you may want to reconsider. The fact is that if you do it again, you can easily fix the issue by just doing the bare minimum. Pick a name, get the list, immediately buy the first thing on the list, wrap it up, and hand it in. Honestly this might be the easiest way to repair relationships, even though it should absolutely not be your responsibility to fix this.\n\nYou could also ask for your niece again and get her extra stuff from her list. Either that or just have your bf get her something to make up for the error last year. Again, this really shouldn't be an issue, but since it is, you can be proactive and fix the whole mess pretty easily.", "NTA personally I think it's rude as fuck for everyone to criticize him for his gifts. He made the effort. It sounds like it was hurtful and unpleasant for him and you don't want to put him or yourself through that again. I think it's perfectly reasonable to say that it didn't work out so well last year and you don't want a repeat, so you'll just take a pass.", "NTA. These things are all so ridiculous. Water bottles are always useful and most children (and adults) love blankets. I assume this girl likes Cheetos? Because otherwise that was an odd decision. I agree just don\u2019t do it. We stopped doing one gift exchange because everyone expected you to spend more than double or even triple the limit. And if people are unhappy with your contribution there is no reason for them to complain about you not participating. They cannot have it both ways. Also I assume your husband was gracious about his accepting his hammer and bag? Twelve year old are capable of that. I was and my children are even at a much younger age.", "I would say soft YTA because it was specified that everyone was going off a list and kids don\u2019t handle disappointment as well as adults. You could have prepared your sibling; bf is excited to shop for niece and wants to go off list.

Fun family.", "NTA - unless everyone can go off a set list of rules, then I wouldn't participate either.", "NTA. after many years of giving unappreciated gifts to my dils, which in my defense I thought they would get a kick out of or at least like, I learned to go strictly off of what they said they wanted. sadly, because I love shopping, I've resorted to gift cards most time. I just feel they're impersonal. but that way no one's got something they don't want. \n\nCan you explain to your family dispassionately that it didn't go well for you and your fiance last year and you'd prefer to just sit it out this year, no anger, no hard feelings, just don't want to do it this year?", "NTA. It's secret Santa. Teaching the kid to not say thank you and move on is the wrong lesson here.\n\nLike...

He told you who he got, because he wanted some guidance.", ">it was gifted with all the good intentions in the world\n\nIt was prob given with the best of intentions, but no one reacted really gracefully/graciously to the 12 year old not liking anything, and it's hard to blame the 12 year old, as kids are not known for their tact after receiving a gift they're not happy about...\n\nher parents should have told her to say thanks and be gracious after getting any gift,  and then privately asked for/gotten gift receipts so she could get something she actually wanted, which your BF should have done with no issue. it didn't have to be a big deal, even if it is disappointing for everyone she didn't like the gifts\n\nOP I hope you do rejoin the Christmas exchange, partly because it sends a positive message (and it's nice to be the bigger person), but also as you wouldn't want your niece to think the conflict/ issue is her fault. she's still a kid and you wouldn't want that to weigh on her\n\nand Im not sure whether to call everyone or nobody an A, depending on how y'all spoke about the gift. the holidays can bring out the worst in us as well as the best, hopefully you can let the conflict go and have a more positive time this year, I'd stick to any gift list provided, too LOL", "You had a LIST!!!!", "Fine, but a 12 year old child gave him a list and he ignored her. Obviously she would be disappointed.   \n\n\nI don't see how this outcome is remotely surprising. Seems like your family is making a bigger deal out of it than it needs to be, but again, this was your bf being inconsiderate and you being \"hands off\" that was an obvious recipe for disaster. No one but yourself to blame here for the family drama.", "Parent of preteen & teen girls here. No girl wants Cheeto merchandise. YTA for not getting things on her list or at minimum close to what was on her list. I hope you had gift receipts. To act butt hurt & not participate this year makes it a double YTA.", "Did you and your fiance put out lists? \n\n\nAnd would a hammer and duffel bag be useful to your fiance? Because, if he made a list, and didn't get something on it, that person is kinda an AH, too. Because he expressed what he wanted, and they knew that as the \"new guy,\" and not a 12 year old girl, he'd be less likely to complain.", ">Not everyone followed the \"rules\" nor was the list a part of the rules. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEverybody else KNOWS the people better - if your AH bf had made the effort to get to konw her better, he would not have gifted her some trash she did not want. He chose not to, and decided he knew better than everybody else what she wanted.", "There was more of a list structure because everyone realized that was a good idea.\n\n\nHas your 12 year old neice participated in previous years? I feel like a lot of families do Secret Santa for adults and just get gifts for kids. Were there other kids involved?", "Still: You KNEW what she wanted, and chose to buy some stuff she had no use for instead. How would that be nice in any way?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat just adds the effort of more trash to discard.", "This one was as he felt he picked out good gifts for her, sometimes you miss the mark in gift giving, it happens.  However doing lists as a receiver is in poor taste unless you are asked, shitting on someone for the gifts they gave you is just wrong.", "Are you insinuating that OPs finances went out of his way to get a gift the niece wouldn\u2019t like? Because that\u2019s clearly not what happened.", "You sound like you\u2019re not so good at choosing gifts.\n\nLists are for people like you.", "Did I stumble into some alternate universe or something? I was raised to be appreciative of gifts, even if they may not be what I want. He thought he would like the gift, he wasn\u2019t being malicious. Stupid perhaps for not using the list, but not deliberately rude. I don\u2019t see why a simple thanks would have been so hard.", "Family is a bunch of AHs. Its secret Santa, who gives a fuck? Maybe they could try getting upset over something that matters.  Someone set the expectation with the child that they would get exactly what they put on the list of suggestions. Or maybe she did that to herself. Getting upset over that and making a stink is entitled. A good learning opportunity for the child that something like this is meant to be fun and lighthearted, not guaranteed. If the spirit of their secret Santa is like this then I wouldn't want to be involved either. \n\nBunch of weird assholes in here calling OP an asshole for not following an unofficial rule that others in their family didn't even follow. Little girl upset, everyone should feel bad!", "I thought OP said the water bottle was on the list but I guess I was wrong. So fair point. But according to OP fiance put a lot of thought and effort into it. He didn't just hit the dollar store and grab the first thing he saw. And maybe he has a bunch of water bottles he likes and like my grandsons picks the one he feels like using that day? So transfers that thought to picking out something for her. We don't know.\n\nI don't know how many times I've had an explicit list e.g. plain gold 1\" hoop earings and see something I think the person would like that is much more attractive *to me* but had to exercise supreme will power and get what they wanted, not what I thought they'd like. Once or twice I've bought the thing I liked better for myself. But that's been a lifelong learning curve.\n\nHe obviously wanted to participate and made a real effort. If she were five I could her see making a fuss about it. By 12 it would seem she might have learned a little graciousness. \"Oh, thank you.\" her family didn't need to make him feel bad.", "maybe he bought her something he thought a 12 YO girl would like? I seriously doubt a 23 YO soccer player would be particularly thrilled with a cheeto blanket.", "OP specifically said \"I\" got a list. It sounds the fiance was added through OP and she basically said \"Yea, there's a list but I think people like it much better when we go with our gut.\"", "Jesus. When did buying a thoughtful gift make him an AH?! Yeah, it didn't quite hit the mark, but he put effort and thought into it. If my kid sulked and had a strop based on a secret santa gift, I'd be disappointed in them for being spoilt and entitled. Literally with gifts, \"it's the thought that counts\".", "Do you understand what secret Santa is", "This should be the number one comment!! Very well said. And true.", "\u201cRules for thee, not for me\u201d", "I mean, some girls do. When I was 12 I would\u2019ve been into that. It\u2019s just that you really need to know the kid before you get them that kind of present", "The boyfriend is not the AH. It sounds like OP misled him. He's not an AH for not taking special interest to learn a lot more about a 12 year old girl. He can only be as involved as OP incorporates him.", "People have different opinions on gifts. The neice made a list. \n\n\nPersonally, I'd much rather someone get me something from a list. It's me saying I appreciate that you care about me, here are some things I need that I know I wouldn't splurge on for myself, but it'd mean a lot to me if you got me one. And I'll respectfully do the same for you, or surprise you if you prefer that.\"\n\n\nBut I'd rather get nothing than something that's just gonna sit in the back of a closet because I feel bad getting rid of it.", "Yes, he made quite an effort to do that.", "Can't be any worse than OP's AH bf.", "And like OP and her boyfriend. That's the point.", "So you were raised to be a little liar.", "couldn't agree more.", "Might be a hot take for me but at any age if you don\u2019t like a gift you should say so when you receive it, or at the very least privately tell them later. \n\nIt sucks cause yeah maybe he put a lot of effort into it, but it\u2019s possible the effort went in the wrong places. Like maybe he was researching bottles extensively, but was a bottle something good to gift to begin with? \n\nIt\u2019s a whole mess honestly, gifts are stressful!", "There was NOTHING Thoughtful about that gift.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe went out of his way to buy something she did not like because HE liked it. Knowingly feeding her trashcan is not thoughtful or positive in any way.", "Do you understand he KNEW what she wanted and decided to get some trash she did not want instead?", "He's not the AH for not knowing the niece that well, but he is the AH for ignoring the list. I joined an office secret Santa like 2 months into being hired. I barely know my coworkers, but conveniently, they all made lists. I went a little off script, like the fiance, BUT I made sure to get something on the list too just in case.", "She made a list, so what.  There is no obligation for the gifter to give from the list.  It\u2019s pretty entitled to give someone a list anyway.  Gifter wanted to try and go for something more personal and failed.  Failing is ok.  They put in effort and was met by extreme criticism.  \n\nWhat you rather and what happens tends to be two different things.  This kid needs to be taught appreciation where she just thanks them for the gift.  We all get and give crap gifts occasionally, if you shit on people for it you end up where people just don\u2019t want to give you anything anymore.  What\u2019s really shitty is these people are now mad people don\u2019t want to give gifts to them anymore as well.  If you don\u2019t like the gifts and criticize them, you should be fine with no gifts at all.", "I disagree but maybe it's a generational thing. I was brought up and brought my kids up to be gracious. It was considered rude to tell someone that you don't like a gift you received. If you don't like it, donate it or regift it or something. You don't have to embarrass the giver or hurt their feelings when they didn't really *have* to even give you a gift. Unless it was totally inappropriate or given as a sort of insult. then speaking up may be OK.", "According to OP he did try very hard, so there we are.  Feel like people saying Y T A have completely lost the point of gift giving. I have been given some utter shite in the past, but you know what? I've thanked them politely as it was a GIFT and I didn't want to act like a brat.", "OP specifically says \"I\" got a list. It sounds like she got all the information and passed it on to her fiance.", "Unless she lied to him about the list, I'm not sure why this distinction matters.", "She keeps repeating about how it was information, that it's more fun when people go with their gut, that the lists didn't really matter, etc. He expected her to know more than he did, so he trusted her. This whole post is about OP not thinking the lists are important. \n\n\n\n\"People made vague, informal lists, but no one really pays attention to them and it's always so much fun when it's surprises and people go with their gut.\" He isn't an AH for listening to his fiancee who is the one who has been doing this for years."]}
