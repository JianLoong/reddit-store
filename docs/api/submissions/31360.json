I got a list of things that she wanted but (this is where we might be the AH) I kinda let my fiance go with his gut. It was the first year he did it and I wanted him to have fun. \n\nFor context, that was also the first year we even had (informal) Christmas lists, typically we just went with our gut. It's more entertaining that way and makes it a little more personal. Like, there was a general buzz of what someone might want but nothing set in stone. \n\nMy fiance picked a few things that he thought were great. A Cheeto blanket and a water bottle (she plays sports). But not what she had said she wanted. Which I, at the time, wasn't really concerned with. He did spend a lot of time picking out the right water bottle and when he saw the blanket he just had to get it for her. And who was I to get in the way. \n\nHere's where it gets tricky. She was not happy about him not going off of her list. And they (collectively) were not quite about it either. It made my fiance feel terrible. And honestly really embarrassed me as I did not think that it was that big of a deal. We've never really had lists before. \n\nSo this year I decided that we aren't going to do it. And now they are mad again. And we are back to the old fight. \n\nETA: Our secret santa has no rules. Especially no rules regarding lists. When I said we had \"informal\" lists last year, that it was just that, informal. It was not a rule to follow the lists, it just happened to be that people were putting out lists. And even last year, we still were not getting what was on these informal lists. My fiance got a hammer and a duffel bag last year. \n\nAITA? \n\nTl;Dr\nNiece was unhappy with what my fiance got her for secret Santa, their family made a stink about it and now I'm not doing it this year and they are mad again.

It's not like she only had one item on the list, and it would have been a super simple way to make sure she liked her gift.", "ESH/YTA border. She's 12, so I understand her reaction. She was asked to make a list, which she did, and she didn't get anything she wanted. That's disapointing to a child. You knew there was a list. Why didn't you tell your fiance to stick to it? What kid wants a Cheeto blanket or water bottle? Horrible gifts. It comes off as regifting or not caring to put effort in. They probably made lists so they wouldn't get stuck with a cheap blanket and a water bottle. But, she should have been grateful. A gift is a gift, even a bad gift. But, YTA because instead of actually sticking to the lists this year, and learning from your mistake, you just quit. That's immature. Your fiance messed up. This year, just stick to the list!", "What kind of things were on your niece\u2019s list?  Were they practical things, relpacemyfor things she already had, or fun things and luxuries?  \n\nYour niece was disappointed for a reason. She asked for, and expected, fun things. Something she didn\u2019t already have several of. \n\nYour boyfriend didn\u2019t consider what would make you our niece happy. He only considered how the gift made him feel. That\u2019s selfish and insensitive behavior. \n\nWhen boyfriend was called out for this behavior, did he apologize?  No. You acted like children, and refused to participate in the next gift exchange. \n\nAnd now you have to ask if you\u2019re the asshole? Of course you are. **You\u2019re insisting that it\u2019s not important to consider the feelings of a gift recipient when choosing a gift. You hurt a child\u2019s feelings, and refuse to apologize.**  That\u2019s definitely asshole behavior. \n\n**YTA**", "I would normally say NTA because secret santas don't matter, and if your fiance doesn't want to participate then who cares.\n\nBut.\n\nYour fiance joined a secret santa with his in-laws. He received instructions of how to participate. Everyone followed the instructions but him. Everyone got gifts they asked for, except the 12 year old niece who got ... a cheeto blanket she didn't want.\n\nYes, your fiance may have had good intentions, but it was rude to disrespect the process that everyone else had agreed to follow, and you are rude for letting this happen. Now your feelings are hurt (because they pointed out you kinda screwed over the 12 year old kid) so you are skipping it entirely. And that's your right, but yes, I think its perfectly natural for others to look down on your behavior as childish.", "ESH\n\nExcept the 12 year old. She had every right to be disappointed in what was, to her, a crappy gift. \n\nYour fiance is an AH for deciding to go off book when buying a gift for a tween girl he barely knows. I have a 12 year old niece, but I know her fairly well. I found a book she might like for Christmas, but I still ran it by her mother, just in case. \n\nYou are an AH for LETTING your fiance go off book. Yes, you say there are \"no rules,\" but I'm sure one of the guiding principles is 'get the recipient something YOU THINK they will like.' Absent any real relationship with your niece, you should have encouraged your fiance to go with the list. \n\nYou are also an AH for petulantly withdrawing from the process this year because the two of you crapped the bed last year. Maybe take this opportunity to show that the two of you have grown as people, and as family members. But instead you want to sulk. \n\nHas your 12 year old niece withdrawn from the process after she got a crappy gift last year? Or is she hoping she will get something that shows the gift giver gave some thought as to who she is as an individual human being. \n\nGrow up. The two of you screwed up last year and got called out for it. If the two of you intend to be part of the larger family unit moving forward, you need to participate in these activities, even if you're not good at them. \n\nAnd expect some Cheetos themed wedding gifts.", "YTA - I get that you aren't required to go off a list, but when a 12 year old makes a list they are going to expect something to come off of that list. Of course she was disappointed by receiving stuff that she didn't ask for. Would it have been nice for her to graciously accept, move on, and then just not use it or give to someone else? Sure, but again she's only 12. Your BF, presumably, doesn't know enough about your niece to just go off the cuff with a gift. Also, do you know how many water bottles the kid already has? She's into sports, guaranteed it's plenty. And not many 12 year old girls want Cheeto merchandise. \n\nBut what truly makes you the asshole here is because you are being petty and refusing to participate this year, all because you BF fucked up last year and didn't buy your niece a gift that she liked and, like most 12 year olds would do, she voiced her displeasure that she didn't get something on her list.", "YTA, not for refusing to do it this year, but for setting your fiance up for failure last year.\n\n\nYou say that last year was the first year people had lists. It seems like most people agreed to do lists BECAUSE they thought it was better. Your niece is 12, she expressed what she wanted, and you completely ignored that to have your fiance \"go with his gut\" for a 12 year old girl, whose family he is joining. \n\nYou're definitely N T A for not participating this year, because you don't want to participate like everyone else decided was a better way to do it.", "YTA. Why did you let clueless fiancee buy something stupid?\n\nYou made him look like a putz.  And now you're the victim.\n\nYTA", "Opting out of an ostensibly fun activity -- especially if it caused hurt feelings the last time you participated -- is not only a clear NTA situation, it seems particularly prudent under the circumstances.\n\nI'm not going to give a judgment over your bf's gifting behavior last year since it really depends on nuances like how 'informal' the lists were, how appropriate the gifts would have been in prior years, and several other factors.\n\nBut regardless, your family are being AHs by pressuring him to join something that is clearly not as light-hearted as was originally claimed", "YTA.  He bought her a cheeto blanket because he just had to get it?  Why?  That's so random and unless she has a thing for chips, pretty obviously a gift she wasn't going to want.", "i don't think you're the asshole here. it's clear that last year's secret santa experience was a misunderstanding and it's unfortunate that your niece and family made a big deal out of it. it's unfair for them to expect everyone to strictly follow their lists especially when there were no set rules or guidelines. you and your fiance should be able to enjoy the gift-giving process without feeling restricted by lists. it's understandable that you decided not to participate this year to avoid any more conflicts. hopefully they can understand your perspective and move past this.", "YTA", "Yikes. 12 is definitely old enough to know how to be gracious over a gift. Though given her family\u2019s reaction, it is clear she is being raised that way. It\u2019s honestly embarrassing for them. Ick. \n\nNTA", "Isn't the purpose of the secret part of secret Santa that no one knows who gives what? So how did they know your boyfriend gave her the gifts. This year there was a list you boyfriend didn't follow it, niece was upset and that is surprising why?\n\nThis year you don't want to do it because of your own mistakes. How about you do it you keep it secret and follow the list it's actually pretty simple. Someone says please get me a b or c and then you get them d in there upset. How about get them a b or c?\n\nYta", "NTA - your fianc\u00e9 had fun with it and they got all butthurt about not getting specifically what they wanted from a list.  It\u2019s pretty entitled to give people a list for a fun event like a secret Santa.  It should be all about the thought that counts and it sounds like your fianc\u00e9 put thought and effort into finding some gifts, which is what should count.  Getting mad because someone didn\u2019t give you what you thought you were entitled to defeats the point of Christmas gift giving. \n\nI would tell your family to kick rocks about the gift exchange since they don\u2019t understand the point of it.", "NTA - I expect a 12 yo to be able to handle that kind of \"deception\" gracefully. It seems the lists were expected to be set in stone, but it wasn't communicated clearly enough. It happens, no need to be rude about it. Your family missed a teaching moment with your niece.\n\nI don't see the point of secret Santa if it's just to pick up an item off a list, but that's me. I wouldn't participate either if I was in your shoes.", "I don't get why a kid is participating in the adult secret Santa exchange between your parents and siblings, since she's none of those things? Is she the reason why lists were suddenly involved, or did someone ask her to make a list? I think she was too young to be involved in the exchange and should just receive a regular present like most young kids. I don't like anyone who gets publicly upset about receiving a present, even if it's something they don't necessarily want, they can bring that up to you privately and ask if there's a gift receipt so they could exchange it. And then the rest of your family piling on like he committed some mortal sin by being bad at present buying? Bad manners all around, and I wouldn't want to participate in that either. Also, if you're expected to buy only what's on the list, what's even the point? Everyone might as well just buy themselves a present. I'm going with NTA.", "Absolutely NTA!!\n\nLists are optional not compulsory", "NTA - typically those lists are just suggestions. The niece should have been grateful to get a present. She shouldn\u2019t have complained. How entitled.", "[removed]", "NTA. What's the point of 'stick to the list'? How is that a gift? People can bloody well buy what they want for themselves at that point.", "NTA, what\u2014is that the ONLY gift she got all Christmas? Why would her parents put her entire enjoyment of the holiday in the hands of her cousin\u2019s 23 year old boyfriend? Kids (and everyone) should strive to show gratitude for the genuine thought put into gifts, and his gift was clearly thoughtful and personal. If the spirit of gift giving was that dead in my family, I wouldn\u2019t participate either. I\u2019m not even sure why they want him to participate so bad if he did such a terrible job last year.\n\nThat being said, I would try to talk this through with them and set clearer expectations for secret Santas before giving up entirely. The main issue I would not budge on is that no one is to be berated for giving a genuinely thoughtful gift.", "nta. it's understandable that you and your fiance wanted to have a more personal and entertaining approach to the secret santa exchange. your niece's reaction and the collective response from your family seems a bit excessive considering it was the first year you had lists. it was meant to be a fun experience and it shouldn't have caused such drama. taking a break from the exchange this year seems like a reasonable decision to avoid further conflict.", "Your niece throws a fit because she didn't get what she specifically wanted for a Secret Santa exchange with no set rules, and now you're caving in and not participating this year? Talk about overreacting. Your fianc\u00e9 made an effort to pick thoughtful gifts, and it's not his fault that your family decided to make a mountain out of a molehill. If they want to be mad, let them be mad. It's their problem, not yours. Your family needs to chill out and remember that gift-giving is about thoughtfulness, not sticking rigidly to lists.  \n\n\nNTA", "NTA\nYou obviously didn't think people had to stick to the lists, so you didn't say anything and you both were treated like crap over it. It is completely understandable that you would not want to participate again. \n\nHowever, you may want to reconsider. The fact is that if you do it again, you can easily fix the issue by just doing the bare minimum. Pick a name, get the list, immediately buy the first thing on the list, wrap it up, and hand it in. Honestly this might be the easiest way to repair relationships, even though it should absolutely not be your responsibility to fix this.\n\nYou could also ask for your niece again and get her extra stuff from her list. Either that or just have your bf get her something to make up for the error last year. Again, this really shouldn't be an issue, but since it is, you can be proactive and fix the whole mess pretty easily.", "NTA personally I think it's rude as fuck for everyone to criticize him for his gifts. He made the effort. It sounds like it was hurtful and unpleasant for him and you don't want to put him or yourself through that again. I think it's perfectly reasonable to say that it didn't work out so well last year and you don't want a repeat, so you'll just take a pass.", "NTA. These things are all so ridiculous. Water bottles are always useful and most children (and adults) love blankets. I assume this girl likes Cheetos? Because otherwise that was an odd decision. I agree just don\u2019t do it. We stopped doing one gift exchange because everyone expected you to spend more than double or even triple the limit. And if people are unhappy with your contribution there is no reason for them to complain about you not participating. They cannot have it both ways.

The blanket itself was admittedly an afterthought, he saw it and really wanted her to have it. At that point I didn't think it would really harm anything to add an additional present as it really wasn't the main gift. \n\nAnd no, myself and the rest of my family are not strangers to getting funny gifts like that from them either. Last year she gave me a gift that is virtually useless, but she just had to get it for me. I still have it and it reminds me of her.", "For added context, at that game (after getting our secret Santas) her water bottle had broken.", "And no, she doesn't really have a \"good\" water bottle. As her aunt, I've listened to her complain enough about her old one, that when he decided to get her that I thought it would fit perfectly.", "Based off the times we've gone to her competitions he's always wanted her to have a better one to replace her plastic one. That's why he decided on a water bottle.", "I guess it really depends on who you are. To both him and I, we are very fond of our water bottles and I carry mine around daily. \n\nOf course you are going to value a water bottle differently depending on who you are. A hydro flask, is not a cheap last minute gift nor was it intended to be. And besides. If a hydro flask is a last minute gift to a sports enthusiast what is a hammer to a carpenter?", "How come that applies for sports and water bottles, but then for OPs BF it's \"You're a carpenter so here's a random hammer that surely you must need and not already have\"", "My fiance and her share the same hobby. Very into sports. Which is not something that the rest of the family shares. So when he drew her he decided that he really wanted her to have a quality water bottle that she can keep forever. Bought the bottle and a few stickers to decorate it with. I guess considering the way that he got so excited about it, and the trend of gift giving up to that point, I didn't really question it. He really wanted to get her something she'd have forever and thought that would be it.", "Yes she has participated in previous years. And has also gone off her gut and bought me things that, well I couldn't even fit in my car if I tried.", "So, with the edit that states the family did the exact same thing to her fiance and bought gifts off the list, does that change your opinion? It seems like their just entitled hypocrites.", "That is not my intention at all. My intention is to give the information as accurate as to what happened.\n\nWhen he told me that's what he wanted to get her, I stepped back. I don't know what else there is. Considering our gift giving history I really didn't think that it was cause so much upset.  As even that year, neither of us got what was on our lists.", "It isn't a Secret Santa at that point.   It is a family gift exchange where people pick names so they don't have to buy a gift for each moment of the extended family.  It sounds like it was one before this and the family changed the rules last year.", "> Is it really Secret Santa if everyone is handing out lists?\n\nThe secret is who gave you the gift, in my experience.", "Sounds like a soup-er present!\n\n^(Sorry, I couldn't resist).", "I\u2019m 37 and would still be stoked about receiving one. I wouldn\u2019t buy it for myself though XD", "Right? \u201cHad to get it for her\u201d sounds like something he enjoyed, not her.", "Yeah my nearly 16yo would adore the ridiculousness of a Cheeto blanket lol. But mmv", "You keep saying it\u2019s \u2018WHat he Really WANTED\u2019 to get her the bottle. A present is meant to be about the person receiving it and not the person giving it. Your boyfriend is selfish", "I'm not saying thought wasn't put into it, just that when people put out lists, it's usually because they want something on the list. The best \"thought\" is thinking about what the person explicitly said they wanted. \n\n\nIt sounds like your family overreacted, but for the most part, your neice knows what she wants more than anyone else does.", "a flag pole? did the person who give that gift jump on the shame-train that ran over your husband? \n\nmaybe you were right to call off secret santa.", "I do see your side of this; lists were new, not everyone else went with the lists, etc. But I think you and BF went wrong in two ways that were entirely foreseeable. \n\nFirst, if a 12 year old gives a list, they want stuff off that list - this was a case of the receiver\u2019s expectations not matching the outcome and I\u2019m guessing she had pretty much already owned one of those list items in her head, so to receive something so off piste was really disappointing. \n\nSecond, she may be big into sports and her life may revolve around it but\u2026 he gave a 12 year old a water bottle. A water bottle dude. I don\u2019t think it matters how much research he did, it\u2019s a water bottle. At 12, that\u2019s a \u2018hey mom, I need a new water bottle for my kit bag\u2019 thing - not your secret Santa present from the family. The thought and research and blown budget may be cool for like an adult runner or something, someone who could appreciate it for what it was and the thought behind it, but not a 12 year old! \n\nI think YWBTA if you stick to not wanting to participate. Just chalk it up to a mistake and a bad reaction and use the lists this year!!", "You keep harping about this water bottle. How much \"thought\" does it take to buy a water bottle?", "I've seen you mention a few times that he really wanted her to have that blanket. Is it an inside joke? Does she really enjoy cheetos? Or did he think it was funny and project it on to her without really knowing anything about her? I'm just trying to understand how he saw that particular item and made the connection...", "I think you're missing the point.  Then her mom should grab her one the next time she's running errands but a 12yo isn't going to appreciate it as her secret Santa gift. You are doubling down all over the place in the comments. Are you being intentionally obtuse??", "I understand it - I've got a beutiful, \"ferrari between the water bottles\" bottle for my last birthday or Christmas (I don't recall it now).   \nIt's beautiful, very, very high quality and I use it every day.   \nBut I'm an adult and can appreciate such a gift.   \nThe niece is 12... weird phase between a child and a young person. They're such a mix of everything, that really the safest way  (now and next few years) is stick to their lists (even then the list can be outdated by the time of Christmas ;).   \nSource:  \n13yo daughter ;)", ">If a hydro flask is a last minute gift to a sports enthusiast what is a hammer to a carpenter?\n\nIf it's one the carpenter *didn't ask for* because they *didn't want it*, the answer is: pointless.\n\nHow much thought could he have put into the water bottle, really? The color? The ounces? That's about it.", "I didn\u2019t see that in the post, did I miss something?", "No? Kindly saying \u201cthank you OP for the Christmas gift\u201d isn\u2019t a lie. I didn\u2019t say the niece needs to be jumping with joy over the present and telling him she\u2019s going to use it everyday, but a simple thank you is appropriate and not a lie.", "He spent a lot of time picking out a water bottle she would like because he knows she plays sports, that\u2019s not what someone \u201cgoing out of their way to get a gift she wouldn\u2019t like\u201d would do. \n\nWas his gift misguided and clearly not what she actually wanted? Of course, but saying that he deliberately chose something he knew she\u2019d hate just isn\u2019t true according to the story we have. Someone who deliberately chooses an awful gift doesn\u2019t feel terrible when the person hates it.", "In my thirties and very much into my tortilla blanket, but might\u2019ve been disappointed as a kid, LMAO.", "Now I want a cheeto blanket", "As mentioned. A lot of people didn't follow lists. \n\nMy fiance is a carpenter so they ( my nephew) got him a hammer\nShe's a cross country runner and does soccer so he got her a hydro flask. \nI don't know why I got a flag pole but I did.", "I joined an office secret Santa and didn't get anything. The person who had me broke his leg and was out of the office. He was in communication with the manager and while he got small gifts accumulating on his desk, I got nothing.", "Not sure if you realize this, but \"Oh you're a carpenter? Here's a random hammer you didn't ask for\" is exactly what OPs BF got in this same Secret Santa.", "OP answered in a comment when they were asked what gifts they got, to get a sense of the norms from everyone else in the exchange", "> Might be a hot take for me but at any age if you don\u2019t like a gift you should say so when you receive it, or at the very least privately tell them later.\n\nI have never, ever experienced someone doing this. I've never heard of anything doing this.", "Just the opposite.  You say \"thank you\" nicely and graciously accept the gift.  Perhaps in this case, brother or sister could have pulled you aside later and privately asked for a gift receipt.", "You\u2019re right. He should have gotten her a hammer or a flag pole, just the pole. /s The water bottle is way more thoughtful than this gifs OP and fianc\u00e9 received. I\u2019d opt out too. NTA", "Your post is bad. All the important info is in your comments. Basically lists weren't followed all around and the only people mad about it are your family at your fiance. You solved their problem, and they got mad again. NTA but your family doesn't appear to like your fiance.", "So your whole family just sucks that giving gifts? Why in god's name would a carpenter need another hammer????  Is the theme 'boring mundane daily items that you would otherwise by yourself'? \ud83e\udee4", "And if that gift giver was here asking if they were TA for giving that low effort gift, I'd call them TA, too. But as far as I can tell, it wasn't OP's niece, so it doesn't change anything on the Offical Judgment part.", "Ah, then I\u2019d say if it\u2019s the same case of buying him a hammer not on his list and with him not expressing interest in hammers, then yeah that\u2019s silly too! \n\nGet someone a hammer if they say theirs broke or that they need one. Or a really interesting one (idk are there electronic or robotic hammers? Not familiar but hope that makes sense).", "You\u2019ve never received/given a bad gift then. But when you do, it\u2019s good to verbalize so they know for next time! I don\u2019t like clothing gifts for example, because I have a certain type I like to stick to.", "How will one learn if they don\u2019t know their gift is bad? And for events, gifts are mandatory. You try not giving someone a gift, especially if they give you one, and you\u2019re a big AH.", "How will the person know in the future to get a different gift if they don\u2019t say something? Feedback is good! Just need some tact which is why pulling em aside is better of course", "Can you point out where it's confusing so I can fix it?", "> Unless she lied to him about the list, I'm not sure why this distinction matters.\n\nIt sounds like she didn't even tell him about the list, or at the very least encouraged him to go off-script. It's her family. Why wouldn't he follow her lead?", "So it doesn't change it given that the norm for this Secret Santa is to give a fun silly gift that reminds you of the person instead of something the person wants? I don't see how OP or her BF are TA for following the same Secret Santa guidelines as the rest of the family.", "I've received a ton of bad or crappy gifts. But I don't count on gifts for anything, and I'm not entitled to them. Most people don't give me gifts, so when someone does, I accept it with a smile and try to make sure they understand that I appreciate that they thought of me.", "I will concede that gift giving in some families is mandatory but that's a family dynamic and not true with all families.\n\nIMHO no gift is \"bad\" if it's given in the spirit of giving and love. Her parents could have approached OP quietly later and said something to the effect of \"Cassie--made up name just to have one--isn't really into such and such. \" and have a discussion about the whole secret santa thing, why they decided to have lists this year, is it really such a good idea, was it because some family members are financially stressed and want to spend money on something they know will be appreciated, etc.", "*And now we're opening gifts from Reytotheroxx.*   \n*What we have here? An awful scarf- how someone could think that I would wear something so tacky?*   \n*What's next? A book? Boring, besides I use my Kindle, books just are collecting dust.*   \n*Body balm? The scent is outrageous. Maybe I can use it to refresh my shoes.*   \n*Another book, cookbook this time. Do you want to say I can't cook???*   \n\n\nAnd on and on in a similar mode.

And it's not like OP and her boyfriend *knew* others were going off list.", "Oh yeah you still thank them n stuff. I\u2019m not saying to get mad, just let em know.", "Yes I agree discussions are good. And generally yeah, gifts are good for showing appreciation. This is coming from someone who doesn\u2019t like waste so there are times when gifts can be bad, although having receipts with the gifts is good!", "If someone was that forward tbh I might laugh. \u201cWhat have we here? An awful scarf-\u201c \ud83d\ude02 \n\nBut what I meant was not in the moment, and with more tact. Like \u201cI really appreciate these items but unfortunately I don\u2019t use them.
