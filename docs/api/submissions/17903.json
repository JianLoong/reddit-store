It can also be having a weekly dinner with your nephew just to let him know that you\u2019re there and you care. Your nephew is still a kid and he\u2019s really struggling. I mean, just hearing about the incident almost made you puke, imagine how traumatising living it firsthand as a child must have been. There\u2019s more to family than just \u201cyou [sister] birthed him, so you [sister] deal with it.\u201d Your nephew is probably feeling scared and isolated, and wants someone he knows and trusts to be there for him.

You told her about the types of help he needs but she's trying to get you to be that help. Tell her again you are not a doctor or a therapist, and just because you know the help he needs that you are not trained to give that help. Tell her you want him to get the help he needs NOW, I mean you can try, but it may fail and just make matters worse for her son. There is a reason doctors don't treat family members as they cannot be objective about the issues at hand.", "NTA\n\nBy your own admission you absolutely are present and aware for the normal process of how these things are dealt with, this is beyond your scope and experience. However, because that is acknowledged by her, she needs to take your advice and get a therapist involved. Especially if she is going to check out, she needs to give him support and if you feel comfortable you can be involved in the same way you would with a client/patient (not sure how your line of work would refer to them). \n\nI\u2019m sorry about whatever is going on and has happened to your nephew. Thoughts are with him he gets through it.", "Of coursw NTA! \n\nI think as readers we can only respect your honesty, adequancy and understanding of the situation: you know that help of a professional is needed and you cannot peovide that.\n\nPerhaps explain it to your sister from a different perspective: we wouldn't want a podotherapist to do a surgery on our heart. For the same reason, you don't possess the necessary qualifiction to be your nephew's live in therapist. Secondly, according to ethical standards, psychologists should not and do not work with family. They cannot be unbiased. (Added: sometimes we need an outside view of an unbiased person; I heard very different things from my family friends compared to what my therapist used to say)\n\nIf you can support your nephew, absolutely great! Tell your sister that you will be there as their uncle/aunt. But this should not and cannot be in place of actual therapy.", "I understand this but I\u2019m trying my best. I\u2019m not opposed to spending time with my nephew at all as we do spend time together pretty often but it is difficult for me because like I mentioned, my job is incredibly time consuming. And while I do understand that my nephew getting help is the main goal here, I want my sister\u2014his mother\u2014to be the one to find that help. Not me. He needs his mother, not me. And I\u2019m afraid that my sister will stop trying the moment I step in because she feels like she\u2019s not good enough or whatever. \n\nUltimately, if nothing changes VERY soon, I will step in.", "I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019ll step in if necessary. I get that you\u2019re in a stressful job. It\u2019s just that my heart breaks thinking of what this poor kid must be experiencing, and I really hope someone is putting his trauma recovery first, whether it be his mom, you, or another family member. He must feel so alone. Wishing all the best for his healing.", "This. \nYou can't just tag out of parenting. It causes huge issues for the child to be removed from home even when the home is less than ideal.", "NTA. You know what you're comfortable doing and what you feel you can do appropriately. It sounds like you're the only one acting in the best interest of the child at the moment.", "If my sister was denying my traumatized nephew professionally help I would be calling CPS to make sure he gets what he needs.", "She\u2019s right - you do know your shit. And part of that is recognizing what is outside your scope of competency, which is exactly what you\u2019ve done. \n\nI\u2019m a psychologist and I work with a lot of trauma (emotional, sexual, service-related), so I want to offer my perspective. You can share with your sister if you think it will help. (I do understand why she thinks it\u2019s a good idea given your work history, but there is so much more to working through trauma than people realize) \n\nFirst of all, staying there for a few weeks and then leaving will likely cause more harm - he\u2019ll adjust to having you there, he may even start feeling comfortable opening up, and then\u2026 you\u2019ll leave. Traumatized people often believe they are broken or unloveable, or that other people can\u2019t be trusted. What she\u2019s suggesting will strengthen these beliefs and he will likely end up worse off than before. \n\nSecond, symptoms often get *worse* before they get better in trauma therapy. You\u2019re opening up painful wounds again and again. Emotions become highly dysregulated, nightmares get worse, and reactivity goes through the roof. It can take months to see progress and you can\u2019t support him for months. He needs a therapist. Like, *yesterday* \n\nThird, does she have any idea what a horrible emotional toll this will take on you?? I see most of my trauma clients on Thursdays - this is because I have Fridays off and I don\u2019t speak to *anyone* on Fridays. I need that time to decompress every week because hearing people describe the time they saw a 5 year old bleed to death or the time they had to try and find all the \u201cparts\u201d after someone got hit by a train\u2026 it\u2019s really fucking draining. My heart hurts so much for these people. And I only deal with it one or two days a week. Every single day? That would be way too much. Not to mention, this is your *nephew*, so it will be even more painful for you to hear about all that he\u2019s going through. That\u2019s not fair to you. \n\nFinally, if you don\u2019t have training in providing trauma therapy, you shouldn\u2019t do it. Full stop. Trauma therapy is often counter-intuitive and requires years of training to learn how to do it. There are so many different types, each with their own benefits and drawbacks. You also need training in knowing how to respond to certain things. Traumatized people cope in any way they can, which can involve doing really fucked up stuff. One of my clients told me they hurt small animals to cope and my job was to sit there and not react with horror, but with compassion. And that takes a lot of practice and it\u2019s not something most people are prepared to respond to. \n\nAnyway, you are doing the right thing by not agreeing to your sisters idea. I won\u2019t comment on cutting her off/ignoring her, because I have no idea what your relationship is like and I don\u2019t want to make assumptions. But I *do* know how to deal with trauma and she needs to get *outside* help", "\\^This!\n\nI fear the sister wants OP to move in as a quick fix so she won't have to worry much or do emotional homework to help her child; at the same time, I also fear the sister wants OP to help, as an unlicensed therapist bc she thinks she'll be able to demand OP to share whatever her child said to OP.\n\nSister: \"Come on, help us, you know your sh!t\"    \nOP: \"I'll just have a talk with my nephew\"    \n*\\[later on\\]*    \nSister: \"Ok, what did my kid say?\"    \nOP: \"I cannot tell you, it was spoken in confidence\"    \nSister: \"What do you mean confidence? You're not even a real therapist, and I'm paying you!!! I have the right to know what my son said!\"\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA, your sister is looking for a quick fix to something that is bound to impact your nephew for the rest of his life based on your description. He needs a therapist who specializes in trauma and nothing less. If you aren't that person and you've recommended resources to your sister so that your nephew gets the help he deserves then you've done all you can. If your nephew decides they want to speak to you about anything it should be kept in confidence provided safety is upheld. You're gf shouldn't even consider you doing this for money. It's not about money, it's about making sure someone who has experienced trauma receives proper care.", "Even if you were a qualified licensed therapist, it would be inappropriate for you to counsel either one of them. Make a list of professionals that you know and respect and offer that and their contact numbers if she calls again.", "NTA. I think the fact that he needs more help than what you can give says that you\u2019re a great Aunt. My sister is a counselor and would never be the one to counsel any family member in a professional manner. She would, like you did, refer his mom to somebody she trust. Keep being the great Aunt that you are. God bless you and your family.", "NTA I would hope you'd talk to your nephew to let him know that you, his aunt, is there for him, but you are not obligated to provide professional therapy - especially not to a family member, and ESPECIALLY because you are not licensed to do so.\n\nHe needs professional help.  If your sister is unwilling to do that, would you be able to take him to some appointments to get started?", "NTA you made your best recommendations but your sister wants someone else to show up and do the heavy lifting. it's one thing to look over the situation and make suggestions, it's another to put your life on hold-can you take a month off work? to solve her problems.", "NTA she wants you to do all the work and thats not fair all the while a child needs their parents when they go through something traumatic (unless the parents did it obviously) and all she's doing is pushing him away. they both need therapy", "I developed PTSD when I was your nephew\u2019s age, and the one thing I absolutely did not want was for my family to have to give up their lives to take care of me. I wanted to avoid that so much that I downplayed a lot of what I was feeling so they would be less worried about me. \n\nI don\u2019t think your nephew would want what your sister is asking for, and I don\u2019t think it would help. The thing I wanted and needed most at the time was for as much of my life to feel as normal as possible. Nothing could ever be normal again, but what helped me the most in starting my healing process was stability and routine, the appearance of normalcy. Having a relative move in because I was broken and they needed to fix me would absolutely have made it worse. \n\nHealing from trauma takes time. I tell people that I experienced the psychological equivalent of being hit by a car. When you get hit by a car, it takes a long time and a lot of medical intervention and a lot of work to recover, and even then you might always walk with a limp or get sore when it rains. Psychological trauma is the same. It takes a lot of work, medical intervention, and time to get to the other side, and when you get there you may not be the same person you were before the trauma occurred. \n\nI really think your sister needs therapy as much as her son does at this point, because it doesn\u2019t sound like she understands that he may never go back to the way he was before. She needs to accept that so she can help him figure out who he\u2019s going to be now.", "The sister is offering to pay for a few weeks. This boy sounds like he needs months if not years of professional help. She's seeking a \"quick fix\" from family. That's the part where she's cheaping out.", "Thank you so much for sharing. I think I might just tell her all this word for word. I hope she listens and tries to understand. \n\nI didn\u2019t mention it, but I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll be able to sit there and listen to my nephew talk about what happened to him without crying or showing emotion that may make him feel bad. I just cannot. It\u2019s hard enough when it\u2019s children I don\u2019t have as much as a bond with. I know in my heart that I am not strong enough. \n\nThank you so much again, I genuinely appreciate this.", "This is exactly why you should trust your instincts. You are too close to the situation to be useful to your nephew therapeutically. There is pretty much an iron-clad rule among trained therapists that we never, ever, ever treat family members. Ever. Or friends. Or friends of friends."]}
