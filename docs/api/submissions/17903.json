Your sister is definitely overstepping.", "NTA. What does your nephew want? Has your sister said anything about that? I think there's a higher chance that a teenage boy will talk about his situation and his feelings with a neutral trained professional, than his mother or another version of his mother (you) that even would move into his privacy in his home. If this happened to my teenage boy brother, I also think there would be a higher chance of him opening up if the trained professional was male.", "NTA Your sister is cheaping out on the level of care for your nephew that has MAJOR consequences to the trajectory of his life.  \n\nI can\u2019t imagine any worse situation to be a cheap ass.", "Why do you have to leap to \"if she asks me one more time, then I won\u2019t talk to her again?\"  Can't anyone simply say no to the request of a friend or relative without madly rushing to terminate the entire relationship?\n\nYWBTA if you actually end the relationship with your sister at a time when she sounds truly desperate.  Conversely, YWBTA if you took your sister's money and moved in, when you are simultaneously stating that you are not qualified to provide the help your nephew needs. \n\nIf you stand your ground about not moving in, and make yourself available only to help find QUALIFIED therapists, you have nothing to feel bad about.", "NTA, you DID help. You told her where to go from here, in your professional opinion. I hope she can stop pushing her issues off on you and address her son\u2019s needs. Good for you for advocating for your nephew and yourself.

However annoying and resistent and foolish she is being, you need to keep communication open so you can (hopefully) get her to see sense and take him to a professional.  You see this shit every day, but for her, her world just turned upside down and she's not handling it well, so of course she's making dumb decisions: assuming the kid was harmed by a stranger, I see totally why she wants to keep him safe inside the family. She's wrong, but I get it.\n\n\nSo NTA for being cold, but YWBTA if you cut her off.", "NTA. It sounds like your sister does not want to deal with her son, and is trying to pass on the responsiblity and possibly the blame.

I don't know him or what happened to him but he might be more comfortable talking to someone outside the family who is actually bound by law and oath to respect his privacy.

Then you can just do everything his parent should be doing, on top of working your high stress full time job.\u201d Smh. Seems like a win? For who? It is not OPs responsibility to parent her nephew when he already has a parent. And it\u2019s not a great idea to further alienate this kid from his mom. OP is NTA. Sister needs to step up and properly care for her child.", "If mom cant be around her child for long  and if OP can help him mentally then it is a win.... again everyone has  different opinions on topics and what not but for the nephews mental health  sanity and to avoid him resenting everyone that sounds like a win... OP doesnt have to parent but help... at the end of the day I believe OP nephew is of age to decide on where he will like to be and if he chooses other options then it's his choice and OP cant then ask should I have helped my nephew... him moving with OP beats the ideal sister has of having OP move in with them..\nEither way a real certified therapist has to help..\nYou have your opinion I have mine good day", "I\u2019m not sure what part of this post you\u2019re not understanding. OP works with a specific population but is *not* a therapist or any other kind of licensed behavioral health professional. How is she going to \u201cnot parent, but mentally help\u201d him? He\u2019s 16. He needs a parent and a therapist right now, and OP is neither of those things. Also, he can\u2019t just \u201cchoose\u201d to live where he wants?

Helping them doesn\u2019t need to be an extreme \u201cput your life on hold\u201d situation. It can be something like taking your nephew to a couple different therapists until he finds one he can trust. It can also be having a weekly dinner with your nephew just to let him know that you\u2019re there and you care. Your nephew is still a kid and he\u2019s really struggling. I mean, just hearing about the incident almost made you puke, imagine how traumatising living it firsthand as a child must have been. There\u2019s more to family than just \u201cyou [sister] birthed him, so you [sister] deal with it.\u201d Your nephew is probably feeling scared and isolated, and wants someone he knows and trusts to be there for him.

I think your sister is panicking, and your experience seems like a quick answer to resolving the problem (even though we know it is not), especially if she doesn\u2019t have a strong support from your nephew\u2019s father. \n\nAt the end of the day, a minor serious needs help. \n\nI think the adults in this situation, need to come together to figure out something that can work.", "NTA. You told her about the types of help he needs but she's trying to get you to be that help. Tell her again you are not a doctor or a therapist, and just because you know the help he needs that you are not trained to give that help. Tell her you want him to get the help he needs NOW, I mean you can try, but it may fail and just make matters worse for her son. There is a reason doctors don't treat family members as they cannot be objective about the issues at hand.", "NTA\n\nBy your own admission you absolutely are present and aware for the normal process of how these things are dealt with, this is beyond your scope and experience. However, because that is acknowledged by her, she needs to take your advice and get a therapist involved. Especially if she is going to check out, she needs to give him support and if you feel comfortable you can be involved in the same way you would with a client/patient (not sure how your line of work would refer to them). \n\nI\u2019m sorry about whatever is going on and has happened to your nephew. Thoughts are with him he gets through it.", "Of coursw NTA! \n\nI think as readers we can only respect your honesty, adequancy and understanding of the situation: you know that help of a professional is needed and you cannot peovide that.\n\nPerhaps explain it to your sister from a different perspective: we wouldn't want a podotherapist to do a surgery on our heart. For the same reason, you don't possess the necessary qualifiction to be your nephew's live in therapist. Secondly, according to ethical standards, psychologists should not and do not work with family. They cannot be unbiased. (Added: sometimes we need an outside view of an unbiased person; I heard very different things from my family friends compared to what my therapist used to say)\n\nIf you can support your nephew, absolutely great! Tell your sister that you will be there as their uncle/aunt. But this should not and cannot be in place of actual therapy.", "I understand this but I\u2019m trying my best. I\u2019m not opposed to spending time with my nephew at all as we do spend time together pretty often but it is difficult for me because like I mentioned, my job is incredibly time consuming. And while I do understand that my nephew getting help is the main goal here, I want my sister\u2014his mother\u2014to be the one to find that help. Not me. He needs his mother, not me. And I\u2019m afraid that my sister will stop trying the moment I step in because she feels like she\u2019s not good enough or whatever. \n\nUltimately, if nothing changes VERY soon, I will step in.", "I\u2019m glad to hear you\u2019ll step in if necessary. I get that you\u2019re in a stressful job. It\u2019s just that my heart breaks thinking of what this poor kid must be experiencing, and I really hope someone is putting his trauma recovery first, whether it be his mom, you, or another family member. He must feel so alone. Wishing all the best for his healing.", "This. \nYou can't just tag out of parenting. It causes huge issues for the child to be removed from home even when the home is less than ideal."]}
