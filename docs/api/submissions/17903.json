Your nephew sounds like he could benefit from therapy for both himself and mom. She can't be around him long? Somehow he must have picked up on that.", "NTA; it\u2019s neither your professional duty (you\u2019re not even trained for the job, as you say!) nor your duty as an aunt.  Your sister is definitely overstepping.", "NTA. What does your nephew want? Has your sister said anything about that? I think there's a higher chance that a teenage boy will talk about his situation and his feelings with a neutral trained professional, than his mother or another version of his mother (you) that even would move into his privacy in his home. If this happened to my teenage boy brother, I also think there would be a higher chance of him opening up if the trained professional was male.", "NTA Your sister is cheaping out on the level of care for your nephew that has MAJOR consequences to the trajectory of his life.  \n\nI can\u2019t imagine any worse situation to be a cheap ass.", "Why do you have to leap to \"if she asks me one more time, then I won\u2019t talk to her again?\"  Can't anyone simply say no to the request of a friend or relative without madly rushing to terminate the entire relationship?\n\nYWBTA if you actually end the relationship with your sister at a time when she sounds truly desperate.  Conversely, YWBTA if you took your sister's money and moved in, when you are simultaneously stating that you are not qualified to provide the help your nephew needs. \n\nIf you stand your ground about not moving in, and make yourself available only to help find QUALIFIED therapists, you have nothing to feel bad about.", "NTA, you DID help. You told her where to go from here, in your professional opinion. I hope she can stop pushing her issues off on you and address her son\u2019s needs. Good for you for advocating for your nephew and yourself. Sometimes people think that help means taking over a problem, which is typically unrealistic and unhelpful.", ">I told her that if she asks me one more time, then I won\u2019t talk to her again. \n\nI undertand your frustration, but this is the worst moment ever to cut her off.   However annoying and resistent and foolish she is being, you need to keep communication open so you can (hopefully) get her to see sense and take him to a professional.  You see this shit every day, but for her, her world just turned upside down and she's not handling it well, so of course she's making dumb decisions: assuming the kid was harmed by a stranger, I see totally why she wants to keep him safe inside the family. She's wrong, but I get it.\n\n\nSo NTA for being cold, but YWBTA if you cut her off.", "NTA. It sounds like your sister does not want to deal with her son, and is trying to pass on the responsiblity and possibly the blame. She will keep complaining about him and how you are not helping enough if you end up moving in. She needs to step up and actually be there for her son.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

OP doesnt have to parent but help... at the end of the day I believe OP nephew is of age to decide on where he will like to be and if he chooses other options then it's his choice and OP cant then ask should I have helped my nephew... him moving with OP beats the ideal sister has of having OP move in with them..\nEither way a real certified therapist has to help..\nYou have your opinion I have mine good day", "I\u2019m not sure what part of this post you\u2019re not understanding. OP works with a specific population but is *not* a therapist or any other kind of licensed behavioral health professional. How is she going to \u201cnot parent, but mentally help\u201d him? He\u2019s 16. He needs a parent and a therapist right now, and OP is neither of those things. Also, he can\u2019t just \u201cchoose\u201d to live where he wants? OP did not invite him to live with her and he is still a child under his parents custody for another 2 years. Your comment is your opinion, but also total nonsense."]}
