However, I suspect he has been smoking vape pen weed for almost 4-5 years, at least 3 though. The real potent stuff. He is an only child, and we use to live in a rough neighborhood, and he fell in with a rough group of kids who\u2019s parents were definitely ex drug addicts, and some current. As an only child I think he really clung to these to not so good kids, and COVID really didn\u2019t help with the isolation. He has failed most classes since around 7th grade. Only my interventions saved him. He has no learning disability. His teachers said he is great, but simply doesn\u2019t complete his work. I also am a teacher and can tell he is very capable. He scores high on state standardized tests.\n\nAnyway, after the 10th time finding bundles of used vape pens I put him in an outpatient rehab where he was tested weekly in June. He was clean for a few weeks, but has failed every test for the past 3 months, and is pRetty adamant it\u2019s no big deal \u2018because he has it under control\u2019.\n\nThe outpatient said he\u2019s either out, or has to go to rehab.\n\nI guess my conflict is that rehab for weed seems extreme. But the kid won\u2019t stop, and he also smokes alone most of the time. Which REALLY makes me worry.

But rehab is a waste of money in this case (just my opinion).  The number one necessity for successful recovery is a desire to stop.  If he doesn't want to stop, he won't, simple as that.", "My thought is that bad relationships with substances - whether it's hard drugs, booze, weed, food, cigarettes, whatever - tend to have an underlying cause. Depression anxiety trauma emotional dysregulation neuroatypical conditions etc etc etc.\n\nRehab might adress the physical weed use but who and what is addressing the underlying issue?\n\nWhat if, for example, the weed use and the bad grades are correlation, not causation?

Brains are still developing until your mid 20\u2019s so moderation before then is really important.", "I smoke weed by myself every day. I have for a long time. I think it becomes a problem when you let it. Just like anything else. Moderation is key.", "I\u2019m gonna go with NTA, that sounds like heavy use for a young brain. But your last sentence really gave me pause. He\u2019s 17, almost an adult. Why don\u2019t you try being honest with him? Explain that you\u2019re not against it in theory as long as it\u2019s being used responsibly and explain what that looks like to you. I\u2019m just thinking back to my emotional teenage brain and the times my parents talked to me like an adult and didn\u2019t try BS scare tactics, those were the conversations that led to changes. Saying 100% no just causes more rebellion and leads to hiding it.", "So here in Canada weed is legal for people OVER 19....because studies show it can really mess with teens heads.....also those vape pens are so dangerous.....NTA he needs help with his addiction before it turns to something worse", "YTA. The weed is NOT the problem. If he is vaping alone, it's his loneliness that is the problem. There's a lot more going on here that is not in your post. He needs to talk to a mentor or counselor that he will trust and open up with to find the root of his isolation. I am afraid that the fact that you jump straight to sending him away to a camp to be brainwashed straight means that YOU are probably part of the problem rather than the solution.", "Why would you never tell him that? Why have you chosen to jump straight into treating him like an addict over having a discussion with him about his use of marijuana and helping him to set appropriate boundaries - when you, yourself, don't feel like weed is all that bad?\n\nHonestly, even if you had found out your kid was doing crack, you've responded the wrong way. You need to open a clear line of communication with him and start making him feel like he can be open and honest with you without facing consequences like rehab for doing so. Try to figure out why he's vaping, what he feels it gives him, what about quitting has been a struggle for him. Understand what's going on before you try to 'fix' it.\n\nAlso, tbh, his grades haven't got much to do with it. I always received the exact same feedback in school and had never touched drugs of any kind. Maybe he has some anxiety or something which is having an affect on his grades, and weed helps him with that anxiety - rather than weed being the cause of his bad grades.\n\nI understand your concern, and your desire to do something about it. But you're going to push your son away if you continue down this path. If he doesn't feel in control of his own life, he's more likely to cling to the one thing that makes him feel more in control - weed.\n\nIt's a YTA from me, but it's a soft one. Well done for being a loving, caring parent - but do it in a more positive way.", "YTA; If he's grown up feeling as lonely as you say he has then I'm not shocked he started smoking. It's something that makes time go by and generally helps with that sense of sadness/loneliness he has been experiencing. Instead of shipping your kid off to rehab, you should try taking him to a therapist first and seeing if they can work with him on finding better outlets.", "If you think the problem is just him smoking while he fails school you\u2019re ignoring your duty as a parent. Millions of kids have smoked weed in school when they shouldn\u2019t have, but the ones who have bad grades have shit going on. Something else is probably up that you won\u2019t talk to him about. You only care about the weed. I\u2019m gonna say YTA.", "NTA, as you are acting in the kid's best interest. But, I fear you may be an asshat to yourself, as I don't see them succeeding with your son's rehab. Rehab is never successfull, unless the patient really wants it and commits himself. I think it was worth a shot, as long as you realize that your relationship to your son may suffer for it. Still, a relationship with an addict is painful also.", "idk if yta but he\u2019s almost an adult you will be pushing him away for sure", "NTA, despite what some \u201cI smoke every day and I\u2019m fine\u201d people say, weed is damaging for a kid whose brain is still in development, especially if he smokes a lot, not to even mention his lungs. That being said, rehab doesn\u2019t really work when you have to force someone into it and weed is different from other harder drugs so I don\u2019t think it would work for what you want and might only potentially damage your relationship with him. I think you should look into therapy, to see if this is coming from a deeper issue, try to find some compromise (it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll stop vaping but maybe he can do it less often?). Explore other options first and try not to antagonize him or you won\u2019t get anywhere.", "YTA for letting it get to this point. If he's been consistently failing classes since 7th grade, why is it only now that you are looking into mental health care? You're a teacher,  you know how much depression and anxiety are increasing in adolescents. Any kid who is failing multiple classes despite no learning disabilities should be screened for mental illnesses and enrolled in therapy. Excessive drug use at that age is often their way of self-medicating. It's not ok, but it's a symptom and the underlying issue needs to be dealt with. \n\nI don't think you should send your kid to rehab until you have gotten them into therapy and done a full mental health screening. You said the rehab has a therapist, but usually they only do group sessions, not individual counseling, and your son will need ongoing care so you should find providers near your home. You should have done that years ago.", "NTA\n\nSaying \u201cit is no big deal\u201d after failing 3 months in a row, is in fact a big deal. It could be a early sign of addiction so rehab sounds like the best for him", "People can be addicted to anything, and while some things are far worse than others anything in excess can be a problem. This is a very difficult situation as rehab may or may not help but he will definitely hate you at least in the short term and, if rehab doesn't help that hate will mean you won't be able to help him in other ways. NTA, but make sure you've explored less drastic options.", "NTA for trying to help him, but rehab for weed does seem a bit extreme.  \nHow has he failed most classes since 7th grade? That\u2019s like five years of it.  If he plans on going to college, they will probably direct him to some remedial courses before his actual study program.  \nI will say, for assuming that an entire group of kids have drug addicts, or ex-addicts, for parents is a bit more than a little asshole-ish.", "You are not an asshole for being worried but please understand: Therapy and rehab ONLY work IF you are prepared to work the programme. If your son is not on board or doesn\u2019t want to change or doesn\u2019t trust/ feel able to communicate with the therapist or the team at the centre then this is a waste of time. He has to want to change first. Rehab won\u2019t work unless he WANTS to change and it seems clear he doesn\u2019t want to or intend to stop. \n\n\nPlease don\u2019t waste your money or his and the rehab centres time.", "I have a masters degree, an amazing job, a family, and have smoked since I was 14, and smoke alone.", "YTA- I met all of my best druggie friends in inpatient rehab. Took me years to get clear.", "YTA he is not doing drugs ffs. You want to force him into worse things?", "Nta for being a good parent and trying to get him to focus and be the best version of himself. For me, the best version of myself (as a person in their late 20s) includes smoking weed every day by myself when I get home or whenever I\u2019m having anxiety. I hold down a job, I function like a normal person and don\u2019t do other drugs. Maybe he mostly needs a therapist, which, don\u2019t you get a therapist in rehab? I\u2019m not sure what rehab is like because I haven\u2019t been there. But basically, just, maybe this is related to something like anxiety and maybe something other than weed can help him with that. And maybe he can get that help in rehab, even if rehab seems extreme for weed. He is a minor so it\u2019s different than a full adult making their own choices after life experience.", "NTA. Thank you for doing this. When my brother was a teenager he was addicted to weed and we found out his brain didn\u2019t process it properly.

Censurably older than your child, likely closer to your age.  I've graduated college and have a successful career. \n\nRehab works for some addictions because you need to break the craving and get through the withdrawals period.  But weed \"addiction\" has more in common with a gambling addiction than it does an alcohol or opiates addiction. It's phycological in nature, not chemical in nature. \n\nEffetely what I'm saying here is this.  He's smoking weed because he wants to smoke weed.  Unlike an opiates addiction where the actual chemistry of your body changes to the point where it \"requires\" the drug to be able to function. An addiction to weed is much more phycological than anything. \n\nIn order to cure his addiction, he has to want to not smoke weed.  Rehab won't accomplish that unless he allows it to. This is a \"you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink\" problem.\n\nUnlike a chemical addition where the drug itself causes cravings, weed is different.  He consumes it because he wants to consume it, but because the drug is making him want it.  I know it's a really fine line and difficult concept to grasp, but it's important.\n\nIt's kids like him who piss me off because they give stoners a bad name.  He does NOT \"have it all under control\" because, as you mention he's failing most of his classes.  He needs to get his life right, then make the choice to smoke or not.  It's not the weed that's making his life fail. It's him, weed it just the means, not the cause.\n\nI don't have any super strong advice other than, if you keep blaming the weed he's never going to be able to pull up out of this nose dive.  He needs to want to get his life on track, and smoking less weed is likely going to be involved.  But it won't be the only change he needs to make.", "NTA.

My so was addicted most of his teenage years and still struggles.", "No but you can become addicted to other shit....he obviously has an addictive personality", "You can become addicted to anything that feels good. \n\nSome people are addicted to shopping or masturbating or eating; weed is no different here.", "Absolutely agree. I think that\u2019s why so many people say it \u2018cures their anxiety\u2019. It\u2019s a drug, and the detox is anxiety, so they \u2018treat\u2019 it by never detoxing", "I\u2019m a straight A student and have been smoking alone since I was 13. Moderation is key and sure it\u2019s a coping mechanism but it\u2019s one that works. \nGet him a tutor and help him cut back a tiny bit. If he\u2019s adamant then let him. This is for sure about having control of his life. Continue going down this path and you will push him away and very severely strain your relationship.\nThere\u2019s a right way to do it. He\u2019s doing it wrong but help him learn to do it right.", "OP, I understand your concerns, but I think it\u2019s actually you who doesn\u2019t understand how common it is to smoke weed (very potent weed) every single day - alone, even. \n\nThe other reply to this comment is a great example. I think I\u2019m also an example of having smoked weed all through my time at a top university and still got a near-perfect GPA. I smoke weed every day with a director level position at a startup.\n\nAnyone who\u2019s worked at an on-site consumption lounge, can tell you that executives, government officials, high-performing tech employees smoke ungodly amounts of the strongest weed and are still functioning members of society. \n\nYou really aren\u2019t getting that this is almost solely a mental health issue, and weed very well may be helping your son cope with the pain.", "I am just guessing here, but this sounds like the son of a friend. He did it as well (as far as I know still does it). My feeling says there is something else going on. Is he tested for ADHD or autism? Drug abuse is high among those groups", "Do you think you\u2019ll ever see him again?", "Weed is NOT a drug. My son is a straight A student, and he smokes. He started with THC oils when he was going through chemotherapy, on doctor's orders. Y'all need to pull that stick out. I know alcoholics and knew drug addicts. They all ruined their lives. Yet no body ruins their life for marijuana. People die from drunk drivers, not stoned drivers. Luckily the kid is 17 and will be able to get away from his crazy mother soon. Rehab for marijuana ffs, smdh", "Well, I was in therapy for years and have tried a lot of different medications before I ever smoked weed for the first time", "Additionally, we have no idea what is actually in those vapes he uses. Especially since it is not regulated I am assuming.", "> Question though: do you think things would be different if you had the current vape pen weed?\n\nNo, absolutely not.  It's not the potency, in the past you just smoked a larger quantity to get just as high.  Being able to smoke without smell is a bit of a game changer but not to the level you are thinking it is. I'm sure if his vape pen smelled strongly of weed, he'd just smoke it anyway. \n\nMy questions to you are of a more particle nature.  He's 17, so you can't remove his housing.  How is he getting money to buy this weed?  How does he have enough personal privacy to be able to hide it?\n\nThose 2 things are things that you, as a parent, can control.  If I were in your shoes I would try to come up with a compromise.  Something like, no smoking before or during school hours.  Must maintain attendance, ect.\n\nTo be clear, weed for a 17 year old is not a good idea.  But I think you are going to have to try to find a middle ground.  But another problem is going to be, he's been failing for so long now that simply not being high at school is likely not enough to bring his grades up.  He's lost years of foundational concepts that are not easy to just catch up on.", "I\u2019m a teacher, and am usually a \u2018suck it up\u2019 type. But I think Covid banged some kids up mentally. And the availability of high potent weed, and the ability to smoke it at higher frequencies even in your own home since it\u2019s essentially odorless is creating a serious future problem.\n\nI almost feel like I\u2019m a few years it\u2019s gonna revert to banning these high potency vape pens. Like they did with 4 loco", "I second this he should be tested for ADHD. Or something else like asd.", "Definitely. We have a very strong relationship", "I ruined my life with weed and know a lot of other people who have too. I have my shit together now but I have to take anxiety meds because weed triggered lifelong extreme paranoia/anxiety for me. Weed affects everyone differently.", "You have no idea what drugs are, have you?\nNot every drug ruins life and makes you an addict, in fact the vast majority does not do that and you know what another name is used for drugs?

And as far as hiding it, I\u2019ve found spent cartridges countless times over the years.\n\nCan\u2019t say this enough, weed is the lowest level drug. But smoking it to the point of failing school, failing drug tests while in an outpatient rehab, and smoking it by himself is the reason we\u2019re here. \n\nI literally even said \u2018 if you would just pass your classes, and pass these outpatient drug tests for 6 months, I\u2019d be fine\u2019 .

Or what?", "I mean, it's a drug in the literal sense, just like aspirin or caffeine is. However, you wouldn't call it 'doing drugs' if a 17 year old was drinking coffee on the daily, just the same as you can't call it 'doing drugs' when someone's vaping marijuana. \n\nIt's not on the same level as the type of life-ruining drugs you'd usually get sent to rehab for, like heroin and meth. It's not even on a level with cocaine, which highly respected politicians and buissnesspeople famously use regularly.
