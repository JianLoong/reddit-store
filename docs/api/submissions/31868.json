My (F27) dad is planning a ski trip for after the new years. When this trip was first mentioned, I was told my brothers (23m + 25m), potentially their girlfriends and my dad would be going. I said it sounded like fun and took time off. \n\nRecently I found out that my dad\u2019s girlfriend and her daughter (19) are also going. Not a huge problem in itself, but classic of my dad to not tell me they were coming initially. Long story short, my dad had an affair with his girlfriend when I was 11-16. I have never liked his girlfriend since. I am cordial now, but I don\u2019t enjoy being around her. \n\nThe reason this is a big deal though is because my dad told me that he planned on me and her daughter staying on the couch because he only got a place with 3 bedrooms. One bedroom for him and his girlfriend, one for one brother and his gf and the last one for my other brother + gf. Disclaimer - this is not because he can\u2019t afford it. He owns multiple vacation homes himself. \n\nI don\u2019t really feel comfortable sleeping in the main living room and not having any privacy on this trip. I need alone time and after finding out that I\u2019ll have to be around someone I don\u2019t particularly enjoy, I really don\u2019t want to be forced to have constant togetherness time. \n\nI said that since I live about 1.5 hours away from the condo, I might get a hotel room for a night or possibly two depending on price and drive up myself rather than spending 4 nights at the condo. I can still ski for a couple of days with them them, but I need a bed. I can\u2019t stay the whole time in a hotel and truly, I can barely afford a night or two, but I\u2019m nervous that if I say I\u2019m not going all together I\u2019ll never live it down. \n\nMy dad and brothers say I\u2019m being dramatic and making a big deal about this and ruining it for everyone and that since I don\u2019t have a boyfriend, I\u2019m not entitled to a bedroom. I get it, but I also don\u2019t want to put myself in this situation.  I didn\u2019t throw a fit or yell or anything, I just said that after learning about the accommodations, I don\u2019t think I can sleep 4 nights on a couch. My dad is pissed because he said I agreed and am now backing out because I don\u2019t get my own room.

This is so dumb, most especially if you're dad can afford it. You're not the AH - Your Dad and brothers are!

That's completely unfair.   \n\n\nANd yes, you're allowed to back out once you learn details you didn't know at first.
