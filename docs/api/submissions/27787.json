They are 25 and 21. We have a family business that works on farm equipment and it is a very good business. Most farmers if something break can usually fix it but when they call us they will pay a lot so they don\u2019t have to buy another half million tractor. \n\nAnyways I have been telling my kids since they were young that if they want to take over the business that they have to get a business degree and work a lot with me to learn everything. Basically they have to put in the work.\n\nWhen they were both teenagers I took them on jobs so they would understand the job. My son made it very clear he didn\u2019t want the job and went to college for sociology. My daughter on the other hand threw herself into the business. She is about to graduate with a business and robotics majors. She also decided to stay at home during college and she has been working with me in her free time. The only issue with my daughter is that she has trouble lifting things but that what strength training is for.\n\nSo now is the problem my son gave me a call, he moved away for a job after graduation and he told me he wants to take over the business. I told him no and it\u2019s going to his sister. This started a huge argument and he called me a jerk. He contacted some of my older relatives and they are mad at me also\n\nEditing: I\u2019m not splitting the business it causes way to many problems.", "created_utc": 1695902461, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ue43m/aita_for_telling_my_son_he_will_not_be_taking/", "score": 630, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
