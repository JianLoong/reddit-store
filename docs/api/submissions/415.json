I was already anxious as I do have social anxiety but tried to remain calm. \n\nHer friends come in and are immediately very enthusiastic to meet me. I tried to match them but was admittedly struggling. Because of that, I decided to go into the kitchen and start making food for everyone.\n\nAlmost immediately after I leave both of her friends start talking about how weird I am. They mentioned my monotone voice and mannerisms. There was some more but I've forgotten. \n\nMy girlfriend went to them and they started talking to her about my weirdness. She was hesitant to answer anything and mainly just kept replying \"She's really nice\" or \"I like her a lot\". I am slightly hurt from the lack of defense considering how they were outright mocking me but it'd feel cruel to ask that much of her. \n\nAnyways, I came back in and had enough. I'm already not well mentally and couldn't be bothered to deal with it so i told them to get out. We argued back and forth but in the end they left. My girlfriend was quizzing me on why I did that and I explained everything. She said that she understands but I shouldn't have kicked them out and I will admit, I do think I behaved irrationally. Her friends are annoyed at me and that's caused a riff between me and her since they are her closest friend. I didn't want to offend anyone at all but also didn't want to be mocked for something I can't control\n\nAm I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1667203385, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yi4gv2/aita_for_kicking_my_girlfriends_friends_out/", "score": 9, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Imagine trash talking someone in their own home and then acting surprised when you\u2019re asked to leave. *shocked Pikachu face* \nYour girlfriend doesn\u2019t sound stellar either.
