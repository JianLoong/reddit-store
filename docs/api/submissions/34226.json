Even though he lived a very happy and healthy life, he had type 1 diabetes which caused me to lose him earlier than I hoped. I have one younger sister (F35) and a large variety of extended family. Me and my sister are really close and my wife (F38) is best friends with her. Recently, I found out that both me and my sister were going to receive around 730k in inheritance a piece. Me and my wife are very comfortable and don\u2019t care a lot about money. My wife and I started a private practice early in our marriage which blew up in size over the years. When we heard about the inheritance, me and my wife had the great idea of donating it to a charity that helps struggling families with affording insulin. My sister was ecstatic about the idea and decided to donate 50k herself which she didn\u2019t have to. It felt like a great way of remembering the name of my father. \n\nFor background, I\u2019m not very close with my extended family as they didn\u2019t treat my dad great growing up, but my sister is close with some so I stay connected for that reason. They\u2019re very religious and when my Dad got divorced, they shunned him as that\u2019s a big no no in traditional Catholicism. They were super kind to my sister and I which is why my dad wanted us to be close to them. So they were not given anything in the inheritance. My sister told one of my cousins about how we were donating the money and that somehow got spread around the whole family. I\u2019m now getting called an asshole for betraying them and selfish for choosing my own wants and strangers over the family that helped raise me. I had no negative intentions but now this makes me want to donate the money even more as I feel like it\u2019s expected. My sister decided to give part to a few of the cousins but I was told that I\u2019m no longer welcome in the family.

Your extended family doesn't need that money and they have no right to it.", "Of course not. This is how people act. You got some money and they want some. They believe they DESERVE some. After all the hard work they did shunning your father. Unfortunately this is typical behavior and shows the dysfunction of many families.

I think your cousins are showing their true colors by getting mad that you're helping the less fortunate, which I'm pretty sure is supposed to be a big thing in catholicism.", "NTA  \nIf your dad wanted them to have the money he would have given it to them.

Hearing about a family member or friend who receives a huge amount of money awakens the worst in people. Imagine if instead of your father dying, you won a lottery ticket for that amount after tax.\n\nYour extended family is terrible. But very very few families on this planet will react in a mature and responsible way to a relative receiving this type of money. \n\nTake this situation as a life lesson, cut off those greedy dirtbags, and move forward with your plans. Congratulations btw.", "I would just say \"This is what Dad would have wanted.\"\n\nThey didn't have a relationship with him so how would they know different?", "NTA. What you do with your inheritance, is your business, not theirs. Giving it to charity is great. I commend you for it. But even if you wanted to put it in a big pile and light it on fire, that would still be no business if theirs because...it is yours. It belongs to you.", "NTA. I have several family members with diabetes and one...she's either on insurance that makes her insulin prices go up or doesn't have insurance, but her doctor at one point had written her a prescription for insulin that would cost her $10. What you're doing is great, as insulin can get expensive fast and if you don't have great insurance, like my cousin, it can still get expensive. I'm lucky; my levoxothyrine costs $13 and change without insurance. Even on disability, it's affordable, but I'm lucky my insurance covers most of it, if not all of it-I usually don't have more then a couple of bucks in copays if/when I have them.", "NTA.  Personally I'd make a donation in their name so they're included in the inheritance.  I'd love to see righteous Catholics object to giving to the needy.", "NTA\nPretty sure there's one or two mentions in the Bible about charity and greed...", "They would probably reply to your comment about all the quotes revolving family and how important it is. I think they would also consider themselves in need too. Student loans and credit card debt according to my sister", "They\u2019re the type of people who make decent living but spent a lot on education and credit card debt. So they\u2019re in need a little but at the same time they put themselves in that situation and seem to be doing okay to me", "Agreed.

A lot of student loan bills and credit card debt according to my sister.", "To be fair, my sister is great and I believe she told them about it because she loved the idea of donating and thought they would think it\u2019s a good idea too. She said she didn\u2019t expect for them to expect anything from the inheritance as they weren\u2019t close to our dad.", "Yes, but they're not at Rick of dying because they can't pay their bills. I love that you're helping families so they don't have to play roulette with their health to keep a roof over their heads and their bellies full. There is no way you could be an asshole for your donation, anyone that thinks you are is selfish and greedy.\n\nNTA", "Then don't worry about giving them a lot of quotes. If there's one that resonates with you, use that. If not, tell them to tell their priest and their deity that they believe they (1) were right to shun a man, (2) are right to demand his money now that he is dead (3) believe they are more deserving of the money than people who can't afford the medicine they need to stay alive, and (4) believe that the true Christian response is for them to shun a family member who won't give them the money that they have no right to but still demand.\n\nIF they believe that their actions are good and righteous, then they will have no problem proclaiming the truth to those they hold in high esteem. Otherwise, they are simply greedy hypocrites.", "Not that I'm pushing Scripture on you at all, but this comment got me thinking, so take it or leave it!\n\nI didn't grow up Catholic, but I did grow up in a super strict, fundamentalist 'Christian' cult. And for as much as the evangelical world talks about 'family values,' I'm sitting here wracking my brain trying to think of any verses regarding either putting family first or how important family is and I'm having a hard time coming up with even one. I mean, I know there's stuff about the importance of a healthy marriage and of raising your children to be good people, but as far as extended family? I've got nothing. (Though, you Catholics have six more books than we do, so maybe there's something in those.)\n\nI do know, though, that the Bible repeatedly commands us to honor our parents. And I can think of no better way for you to honor your father than by making this donation to help those who are battling the same disease that claimed him.", "As you say, their situation is of their doing. They don\u2019t need a handout to put a band-aid on it and hopefully won\u2019t incur more debt because they\u2019re expecting a payday out of you or your sister. You\u2019re going to give people life, and that\u2019s far more in the spirit of Christianity than what your cousins are doing.", "Three quarters of a million simoleons?  All of a sudden they were your father's loving family praying hard for him down at the cathedral on their knees wearing sackcloth.\n\n/s"]}
