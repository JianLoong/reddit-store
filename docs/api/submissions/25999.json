Even if he did how selfish and callus are you to say some sick crap like that?! Over a damn car at that! Your brother is a sick AH.", "NTA. If your brother had changed so much, he would have contacted you himself to apologize for his outrageous behavior. If you establish contact, he's going to hit you up left and right for the next 18 years for money, gifts, you name it, and you're going to be called selfish and a bad aunt if you don't oblige because it's \"for your nephew\".", "NTA\n\nIf flesh and blood matters so much why isn't your brother contacting you?  The very fact that he isn't casts doubt on him having 'changed for the better'.  Your mother is probably trying to act as an unwanted intermediary to patch things up, and after speaking to your brother, tried you instead.", "OP, why in  the hell did your brother think/believe it was your obligation to give him money to buy a freaking car?  \n\nAlso notice who called you to tell you about the newborn.  Your Mom has a golden child & it's not you.  \n\nNTA.", "NTA. It\u2019s your choice who you decide to spend your time with. It\u2019s precious and you never get it back. If he cares about you he wouldn\u2019t have been upset in the first place. Had I found out my siblings pet was on deaths door and she was struggling to save its life I wouldn\u2019t have even given a thought to a car or any monetary object. \n\nHis actions and words say a lot about who he is as a person and that person is scary. To tell you to take its life as if it meant nothing is a huge red flag.  He hasn\u2019t even tried to make amends to you this entire time! Don\u2019t let someone else try to make you feel bad or guilt trip you into doing anything your uncomfortable with. Your mom is just as bad for trying to force this after knowing what has happened.", "NTA. Does he really have a genuine interest in reconnecting if he's going through your mum? Who's to say he doesn't want you back in his life for his nephew and because he will eventually want financial support for that too. Wouldn't put it past him if he thought asking for 20% on an Aston Martin was an acceptable thing to do!", "NTA. Your mom SAYS your brother has changed, but he hasn't reached out and apologized for being an AH, has he? That should be the first move.", "NTA. Hes not changed, he just wants to brag. If he was a changed man he would have called you HIMSELF instead of having mommy do it. A fancy car is not a priority, a life is - so happy your dog got to live so long after treatment!", "NTA \n\nobviously it is nice to keep connections with your family but when your brother hasn't even apologised about the horrid things he did. I wouldn't even think about it.", "NTA. Send your well wishes and leave it at that. I hope no one demands your brother to pay for their whims when he needs the money for his child.", "NTA. It's up to you whether you want to resume a relationship with your brother and by extension, his son. He has not reached out to you personally which indicates to me he hasn't changed much. To me, his comment about your dog was unforgivable but if you miss him, you could open the door.", "NTA, if anyone had said that about my dog I would have done the exact same, especially due to a fuck*** car. Plus he didn\u2019t even reach out to give a apology which shows he hasn\u2019t changed.", "NTA. What the hell? I don\u2019t believe those words can ever be taken back or should be forgiven.", "NTA\n\nHas he apologised for being a selfish uncaring prick? I suspect not.\n\nyou can choose to see him and your nephew or not, it will always be your choice. He probably wants money!", "NTA. \n\nYour brother is a major league AH for saying that hurtful crap about a living creature you loved!! If he really did change, he should brass up and talk to you himself.\n\nSome passed time and having a kid doesn't just change a person.", "NTA, but you still need to consider us you want to freeze out not only your brother, but your baby nephew who can't help what happened. I'm not saying you shouldn't, but you need to think carefully about how important it is to you to not take the first step in a possible (emphasis on possible, maybe he's still an asshole if he hasn't reached out) reconciliation here.", "I get why you don\u2019t want to see your brother; he was a major AH in the chemo/car situation. But that was also six years ago.\n\nYour nephew isn\u2019t an AH, your mom isn\u2019t an AH, we don\u2019t know if your brother is still an AH, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH if you decide you don\u2019t trust your brother to not be greedy and have your best interest at heart. So NAH.\n\nWord of caution: issues with siblings tend to get worse and not better unless you also cut yourself off from your future inheritance.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
