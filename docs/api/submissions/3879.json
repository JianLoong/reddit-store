So it sounds like your child support is court ordered based on income, but he technically doesn\u2019t have any reportable wages because his parents still pay for everything for him, and he\u2019s doing well lazing around, presuming you\u2019re a reliable narrator . That\u2019s a drag for you for sure.  You\u2019re working, trying to make ends meet while paying him something you know he doesn\u2019t \u2018really need\u2019.   I don\u2019t blame you AT ALL for making him buy every last thing he agreed to be on the hook for.  He\u2019s the father of your child\u2026he shouldn\u2019t be mad that you CONTACTED him for ANYTHING child related.", "INFO: What did your daughter need for school? Did it absolutely need to be bought that night?", "You are court ordered to pay child support. There must be a good reason as to why your judge felt this way. Usually with shared custody, the courts determine which parent should be awarded with child support after taking both of your incomes into consideration. Due to this reason, this tells me that you\u2019re making a pretty good chunk of money too for your ex-husband to be the one who was awarded with child support.\n\nYou are also legitimately asking your ex to break court orders by asking him not to make you pay child support which could cause you both to be held in contempt. You clearly want to sink the ship, and you want him to go down with you.\n\nWhen your daughter is at your house, it\u2019s your job to provide for her while she is in your care. By not providing for her at your home, you are being neglectful. Your mindset of \u201cI\u2019m not going to buy my daughter anything when she\u2019s at my house, he needs to buy it for her\u201d is also not showing the courts that you are fit to be a parent. Regardless of whether you pay child support or not, when she\u2019s at your home, you are supposed to take care of her and to provide her with what she needs while in your care. That\u2019s how shared custody works and is also an obvious example of being a good parent. \n\nYTA.", "ESH.  You for telling her to call so late.  Him for not just saying, \"Okay, sweetie, I'll make sure you have it by Monday.\" and then going back to bed.", "ESH except the poor child caught in the middle of her warring parents.

You owe it to the child to get along as much as humanly possible and not pull petty stunts out of spite.", "Child Support doesn't care about the finances of who gets custody, they only care about WHO gets custody.\n\nGoing through this now. I'm supporting my ex with roughly $1,200/mo with everything I'm paying for. Half of that is child support, other half will disappear once the divorce is over with.

That's what courts look at not quality of life.", "I read it as the ex was able to claim he has no income while OP had to declare hers - which means the judgement was that the one with an income paid child support to the one without. Based on the fact that his family provide him with what he wants but it\u2019s not in the realm of being employed with a steady income, etc. it may be that it is technically true, and he was able to convince a judge that his family wealth wasn\u2019t available to him. \n\nFrom what OP has written, he absolutely does have access to his family\u2019s money and is being malicious in forcing OP to pay him. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t indicate either way what OP\u2019s financial situation is but, by saying that the arrangement was only punishing their daughter, I would say it\u2019s probably not the best. \n\nI see this as play stupid games, win stupid prizes on the part of the ex. He decided to plead poverty when it wasn\u2019t true, he decided that he would temper the effect of that on his daughter by agreeing to make the purchases for her instead of not taking money from her other parent. \n\nNTA in my view.", "Most of the time, child support is based on income. So since ex has no income, op has to pay child support. Court only sees the paper trail. Not the reality of what is going on. Based on their agreement, ex shouldn't get upset. If he didn't want to be bothered late at night for what child needs, maybe he should consider dropping child support. Like op says, it is only hurting the child. Esp if op cant provide right then and there.", "Wrong. If its joint custody, they look at incomes of both parents. The one with more income will pay child support.", "That\u2019s not always the way it works out. It\u2019s a calculation based on the percentage of time with each parent, and each parents income. If someone is super rich and has the kids 60% of the time, they could end up paying child support.", "we have 50/50 I pay because he has never worked in his entire life so his income is way less than mine while he is living a luxury life", "She could be trying to smear him because of the divorce too. There isn\u2019t enough information to support this, so we\u2019re only left with what she claims.\n\nAnd I doubt they even know everything going on in each other\u2019s lives since they are split up, but she still shouldn\u2019t be asking him to buy her daughter things during her time because it\u2019s legally her responsibility when the child is with her.\n\nShe will have to take him back to court to try to appeal the judgment, but if she\u2019s solely depending on him to provide for her daughter during her time, this will not look good for her.", "I understand your side of things, but OP also doesn\u2019t mention her own income, and while he could be a complete narcissist who is hellbent on making her pay after the divorce because they exist, there also could be various other reasons as to why she was made to pay child support, especially if he is the custodial parent, which is what the case may be here, but of course, I\u2019m not sure of this either.\n\nBut what does get me is that if she wants to take him back to court over this, by depending on him to provide for the child while she is in her care, this will not look good on her, and it may not work out in her favor because it will also appear as if she is neglectful, and her begging him not to make her pay child support can also be used against her, especially if he lawyers up and hires a good attorney to fight it.", "They would have to go back to court in order to have the child support revisited. You can\u2019t just \u201cdrop child support\u201d. It is legally mandated and ordered by a judge and can\u2019t be changed or not followed without going back to court to have it changed.", "I've seen it to where someone has had the kids during the weekdays while other parent has them on weekend. Guess who paid child support? The one who had them during the week. Why? Higher income.", "That is so absurd. NTA."]}
