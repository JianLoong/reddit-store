So it sounds like your child support is court ordered based on income, but he technically doesn\u2019t have any reportable wages because his parents still pay for everything for him, and he\u2019s doing well lazing around, presuming you\u2019re a reliable narrator . That\u2019s a drag for you for sure.  You\u2019re working, trying to make ends meet while paying him something you know he doesn\u2019t \u2018really need\u2019.

That's what courts look at not quality of life.", "I read it as the ex was able to claim he has no income while OP had to declare hers - which means the judgement was that the one with an income paid child support to the one without. Based on the fact that his family provide him with what he wants but it\u2019s not in the realm of being employed with a steady income, etc. it may be that it is technically true, and he was able to convince a judge that his family wealth wasn\u2019t available to him. \n\nFrom what OP has written, he absolutely does have access to his family\u2019s money and is being malicious in forcing OP to pay him. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t indicate either way what OP\u2019s financial situation is but, by saying that the arrangement was only punishing their daughter, I would say it\u2019s probably not the best. \n\nI see this as play stupid games, win stupid prizes on the part of the ex. He decided to plead poverty when it wasn\u2019t true, he decided that he would temper the effect of that on his daughter by agreeing to make the purchases for her instead of not taking money from her other parent. \n\nNTA in my view.", "Most of the time, child support is based on income. So since ex has no income, op has to pay child support. Court only sees the paper trail. Not the reality of what is going on. Based on their agreement, ex shouldn't get upset. If he didn't want to be bothered late at night for what child needs, maybe he should consider dropping child support. Like op says, it is only hurting the child. Esp if op cant provide right then and there.", "Wrong. If its joint custody, they look at incomes of both parents. The one with more income will pay child support.", "That\u2019s not always the way it works out. It\u2019s a calculation based on the percentage of time with each parent, and each parents income. If someone is super rich and has the kids 60% of the time, they could end up paying child support.", "we have 50/50 I pay because he has never worked in his entire life so his income is way less than mine while he is living a luxury life", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "I've seen it to where someone has had the kids during the weekdays while other parent has them on weekend. Guess who paid child support? The one who had them during the week. Why? Higher income.", "That is so absurd. NTA.", "I\u2019m gonna say NTA. If you guys have equal custody but he gets child support because he doesn\u2019t work and you do but he\u2019s a essentially a loaded trust fund baby, I think it\u2019s immoral to take the money from you. But then when he\u2019s doing that, knowing that it limits what you can provide for your daughter and says \u201coh, instead of making the child support situation fair, I\u2019ll buy her what she needs\u201d, he\u2019s basically buying her love. He\u2019s making sure he\u2019s always the hero, always the parent treating her and buying her the big ticket items. It seems like a deliberate and manipulative choice to try to be the favourite parent.", "NTA", "Nta. Suddenly remembering and needing things last minute comes as part of being a parent. It's frustrating as all else, and it can be a parenting point where you let kid go without if it's a common issue. He should know this is the norm as a parent regardless of who agreed to pay for what.", "So unless your ex buys stuff for your kid you won't, the courts looked at everything and you have to pay and are upset. You sound completely vindictive", "I don't see why that matters. OP's ex is a huge AH for insisting on receiving child support he doesn't need, to the obvious detriment of his child, and finally made one small concession: he would buy whatever their daughter needed. Their daughter needed something, so she called her dad and asked him to buy it, in accordance with the agreement he freely made. If he doesn't like being inconvenienced by his own greed, he is free to stop being greedy at any time, and instead prioritize his daughter's welfare (not to mention doing the ethical thing).", "As the above comment stated, having no job means having no income; his parents supporting his lifestyle is not considered an income in court. \n\nAnd knowing whether or not someone has a job isn't exactly hard to get information, especially since their daughter would likely know whether her dad worked for a living. In order to not pay child support at all, he likely had to verify in court his jobless status. While you can disagree with her actions, it's unlikely that she's lying about him having more money than her and not working.", "The most likely reason is he has no verifiable income. On paper. automatically has more than him.", "That\u2019s what she means by not making her pay child support.", "Nta you need to start documenting everything he has in his life and let the courts know so they understand that he\u2019s not just broke and his family is funding his life", "ooh girl I thought i had it bad with my daughters father. This is a whole new level of rage inducing bullshit. Definitely NTA fuck him", "ESH. You had a kid, you are liable for child support. Don't like it? Don't have one. He's also TA for trying to be \"the fun parent\" because he is the one who always gets to take her shopping. There must be a middle ground. Consider mediation or therapy.", "ESH, you aren't off the hook for contributing for her just because you've got it in your head that he's solely responsible.\n\nYou are still equally responsible for her and associated costs.", "Using HER money to buy stuff \ud83d\ude44", "that's not how it always works lol.", "incorrect", "would you not be upset that you have to struggle financially because you have to pay money to your freeloading ex who lives in luxury?", "This is my thought process. Just because the other parent has more money doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t responsible for a single one of her kids needs. She really thinks she shouldn\u2019t have to pay for anything her daughter needs just because the dad has more money?? What??"]}
