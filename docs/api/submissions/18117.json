Ask your fianc\u00e9 what his plan is if you go into labor while he\u2019s away, and ask him how he\u2019ll feel if he misses the birth of his first child bc he\u2019s stuck in graduation traffic. \n\nAfter that, he gets to make his own decision. Make sure you have a backup partner for the night he\u2019s gone.\n\nEDIT TO ADD: Ah, OP, you really left out a lot of important info, don\u2019t you think? This niece is your fianc\u00e9\u2019s deceased brother\u2019s child. She\u2019s pretty much all that\u2019s left of his brother, don\u2019t you think? A few months back, when this same niece lost her mother, you forbade your husband from attending his SIL\u2019s funeral because, while it\u2019s sad that she\u2019s dead and all, his SIL wasn\u2019t really family. Of course, most people go to funerals to support the living (you know, his niece,) but you didn\u2019t feel well, and you\u2019re way, way more important than his niece, right? \n\nIt seems like you\u2019re trying to prove to everyone that you are the most important person in your fianc\u00e9\u2019s life, and your fianc\u00e9 shouldn\u2019t care about anyone except you - especially not his niece. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ve ALWAYS been jealous of his niece, or if your jealousy is an artifact of your pregnancy. Does her youth, vibrancy, and success make you feel old and dowdy and useless? Pregnancy hormones can do that. \n\nYou need to seriously develop your compassion. It\u2019s a necessary quality to have as a mother, and it\u2019s a crucial quality to pass on to your child.\n\nPeople without compassion tend to be inexcusably selfish AHs , and you don\u2019t want that for your child, do you? One per house is plenty, don\u2019t you think? You should be truly ashamed of yourself. You owe your fianc\u00e9 multiple apologies and your niece at least one.\n\nRedditors: I\u2019m not going to change my \u201cofficial\u201d judgement bc it\u2019s so late in the voting process.", "INFO You\u2018re at 34 weeks now, the ceremony is in a couple of weeks and a few hours away.

Are there any warning signs pointing to a premature birth? Sure, early labor happens, but not *that* often without any warning signs.", "You\u2019ll be 37 weeks with your first and he\u2019s having an overnight stay 6 hours away. Plenty of babies come at 37 weeks. You\u2019re his heavily pregnant wife and you\u2019re nervous about being alone. That should be reason enough.\n\nETA. Your updates change everything. YTA. You\u2019re awful.", "NAH. Neither of you want something unreasonable. Maybe the two of you could wait a few days before the graduation to make a final decision.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say N T A. In other comments, you've clarified that it's a 5-6 hour drive, and you'd be about 37 weeks pregnant. I wouldn't recommend you go. Your husband needs to be there for you if you go into labor. I'm not sure why so many people seem to think that all pregnancies go to 40 weeks. It's incredibly common to give birth earlier. I had both of mine at 36 weeks. I understand this will probably be upsetting to your husband, but he needs to prioritize you. Being without him for 5-6 hours if you were to go into labor with your first child would be very stressful. I'm sure I'll get down voted for this, but I just don't think you're in the wrong for being worried.\n\nETA: it's come to light that his niece's father (your fianc\u00e9's brother) died shortly after she was born. Her mother apparently also died within the last two months, and you griped about him wanting to go to the funeral be a you \"didn't feel good.\" I want you to know that you're N T A ONLY in this specific situation because your concerns about going into labor are legitimate. In all other aspects, however, I'd say you're a wildly selfish and unpleasant person. I hope he's able to witness the birth of this baby. And then I hope he thinks long and hard about whether or not he wants to be married to someone who is so nasty and deceitful.\n\n2nd Edit: Ya know what? Fuck it. YTA, OP. You tried to paint this man as a villain, but that villain is actually you. You tried to trick us all into feeling bad for you. The only reason I hope he's able to be there for the birth is for his own sake. You're not entitled to him supporting you if this is how you treat him.", "NTA  My water broke at 4am, waking me up.

Will she have other family there?\n\n[edit: it appears that OP has left out some material information which is misleading about her conduct. Whilst it remains my view that OP is reasonable in wanting her fianc\u00e9 to stay, it seems clear that OP has a history of seeking to prevent her fianc\u00e9 from engaging with his family.]", "NTA Yeah, that's cutting it pretty close to your due date. Anything week 36 and above he should really be around to support you. 37 complete weeks is considered full gestation. I'm on your side, here. I think you need to be firm about this and make sure you explain your concerns about your approaching due date. If he agrees, he respects you. If not, well, then I'm sorry.

People here all sound like assholes.", "NTA- I wouldn't want to go into labor in a totally unfamiliar location HOURS away from home. All of my major laboring for my 2 kids was done at home, with all my comforts, in my own way. I would NEVER want to labor more than a few minutes in a car!! (Yes I'm lucky enough to live within a 5- 15 minute drive to my hospital of choice) But labor sucks already, why add to your discomfort? You have been creating a whole human for the last 10 months (yes it's said to be 9 but come on, 40 weeks is 10 months), you deserve every comfort you desire at this point.\nEdit: corrected spelling", "If you will end up being all alone, then NTA.

Think of a solution whatever he will answer.\n\nAnd you said \"fianc\u00e9\". If my partner do this to me, I will definitely keep him as a bf, not a husband. You're clearly not one of his top priorities, even you're vulnerable. Just something to think about.", "I went into labour 17 days early and ended up having an emergency C section with my first.

I understand being anxious about your first labour - but I don't think your partner is wrong for wanting to go to the graduation.\n\nMy husband is a FIFO worker and was away when I went into labour early with my first pregnancy. He had to wait for tickets and everything and took eight hours to get home and still made it in time. In fact it was another eight hours after he arrived before I birthed my eldest. It's extremely unlikely your fiance would miss your labour with only three hours to travel. It's also not as common for first time mother's to go into labour super early so I wouldn't stress too much.\n\nDo you have family/friends close by who you and your partner can organise staying over for the night he's gone? I stayed with my mother whilst my husband was away in the last couple of weeks of pregnancy and she was the one who took me to the hospital when I went into labour early.", "I would say NTA. From the comments I read from you you will be 37 weeks pregnant and going for a 5-6 drive to and fro. And it's your first born. Your emotions are running high due to what your body is going through and being without your partner for any amount of time is definitely scary. However, not everyone makes it to 40 weeks especially with no prior births to compare to. Your husband wants to support his niece which is completely valid, but you should come up with a compromise.", "NTA, I went into labor at 38 weeks exactly with my first baby and had gone in several times with contractions through my 37th week. My water broke at 38 weeks exactly. If my husband hadn\u2019t been home I would have been even more of an anxious wreck than I was. I started having early labor signs at 36 weeks when baby dropped and would consistently have contractions for hours that would just stop. Being 6 hours from home is not something I\u2019d ever do past maybe 34 weeks. Could you do a trip early to congratulate his niece or maybe take her out to dinner? Zoom link to the ceremony? Meet and greet with baby/graduation party? Any number of things that don\u2019t take your partner 6 hours away this close to the end of your pregnancy.", "~~Can't believe all these Y T A comments. Babies do come early and OP has a valid concern. Around that time it's really dangerous to even risk traveling while that heavily pregnant. Even when I was 37 weeks pregnant with our son, I didn't want to risk traveling either. However, OP's fiance wants to go support his niece, and graduations are a pretty huge once-in-a-lifetime event so I completely understand why he wants to go also. Really N A H in this situation because I see both sides. OP you're in a tough spot and I hope you and your fiance are able to come to a decision soon! If you both don't go then definitely send a gift, and if your fiance does go just make sure you have someone by your side in case you do go into labor while he's gone!~~\n\nEDIT: Jesus christ guys OK, I fell asleep and woke up to my comment blown up.

It was to grieve a lost family member, and I thought it was important that he go to get closure and support.  I was texting him from his first layover on his way home, when my water broke.  He must have gotten on the next flight minutes before I texted him, so he didn\u2019t see it until his next layover, 12 hours later.  Thankfully, I was in labor for 24 hours and he had already done the first stretch of the trip home before my water broke, so he made it to the hospital in the middle of the night, and our baby came in the morning, so it all worked out.  But it was really stressful.  Also, my pregnancy was perfectly healthy until about a week before I went into labor, when it suddenly wasn\u2019t and my doctor told me I had to stop working immediately and stay off my feet.  I don\u2019t blame you for wanting him nearby just in case.", "NAH this is new for all of you. Maybe get the drs opinion with him and make a decision based off that.

That's so rare on AITA.\n\nI think you two should compromise and play it by ear. Get input from a doctor on how likely you actually are to pop closer to the graduation. You didn't mention being high risk or living somewhere where no one is nearby to help, so your fear is understandable but likely just normal nerves.\n\nIf the doc says you're in a good place and the baby shouldn't come early, just have an agreement that his phone stays on and that he answers it (even via text if he's actively at the graduation). Have a local friend be your \"backup.\" I've played that role even when the husband WAS there because he was too freaked out! If possible, he could also see if a relative would drive back with him if something happens so he can focus on staying in contact while they drive.\n\nThis could be your last couple of days with the house to yourself for a while, too.

Baby is going to come when baby decides and due dates can be off an average of 2 weeks. \n\nIn the NICU we tend to be more nervous about a 37 week delivery than a 36, 35, or even 34 week one.

You blocked your fianc\u00e9 from going to his niece\u2019s mother\u2019s funeral a few months ago on the grounds that the mom wasn\u2019t really family anymore since her dad (your fianc\u00e9\u2019s brother) died when your niece was a baby?  That is monstrous.  You sound deeply controlling, selfish and narcissistic.  Which means I have zero grounds to believe your upgrade in the distance for this trip from \u201ca few hours\u201d to 5-6 hours is true, and not just another manipulation to get what you want here (I.e., a N T A vote).\n\nOriginal:\n\nSlight YTA.  A few hours\u2019 drive away is very doable for him.  Even if you were to go into labor while he was away, the odds that you would have the baby in the few hours it would take him to drive home are exceedingly slim.

If you call him and need him to get home, he just hops in the car and leaves.", "NTA I was going to vote the other way but the additional information changed my mind. You'll be much closer to giving birth by the time and 6 hours is a long way away for something none essential.", "NTA although I can see why he wants to go as its not about a gift card but his presence there that the niece wants.

You are completely right to say what you do or don't feel comfortable with doing in your final month of pregnancy. If you really wanted, you could talk to your doctor about it, but again, it's what your comfortable with. Graduations are also long and crowded and the venue might be outside in uncomfortable chairs or inside where you have to climb a bunch of stairs for seating. Not sure of the exact  situation with fiance's niece but just pointing out that it's different from going to, say, a restaurant or a party at a family home where the bathrooms are really close. But I digress, because again, it's your say what you feel okay or dont feel okay doing. \n\nBut your fiance should be able to go if he wants. It is not that far away if you go in to labor or if there is some kind of issue or emergency. You shouldn't forbid him from going 'just in case', that isn't fair just like him saying you have to go wouldn't be fair either. \n\nSo just let each other live on this and congratulations on your baby. :-)", "NTA, his pregnant wife and baby need to be his top focus.

I'm currently 39W pregnant, and wouldn't have had a problem leaving town for something like this at 36-37ish weeks. In fact, I went to an out of town wedding a few days ago at 38W4.

I wouldn't want my DH to miss an important graduation if he is close to his niece and I can make sure that I had support and a plan just in case.

Show your support, let everyone ooh and aah over your belly, enjoy a nice hotel and then head back. \n\nChances are slim your baby will decide to pop out right in the middle of the valedictorian speech.

The average first labour is 24 hours - my first labour lasted 42.5, my sister-in-law's first took even longer.\n\nI was at family weddings days before giving birth to each of my children (both times, they were the same weekend I was actually due!)\n\nThe first was close to home; I walked further than the venue whilst in labour!

See if they are live streaming the ceremony. If so, he could attend virtually. Aside from you possibly going into labor, there's the whole Covid thing that is not gone, just out of the news.

As someone who got a randomly high pressure in week 36 and had to get induced asap, I am really surprised by all the YTA votes.

It wouldn't be the first time bad things happen and the nearly-mum might not be conscious to make healthcare decisions. The first reason for another person to be present at the birth is so that there's someone who can make decisions in case mum passes out or has to be put under general anaesthesia.

Giving birth is a big deal and trumps his niece\u2019s graduation.

It\u2019s not really about the exact number of hours or weeks.

There\u2019s no point in fighting. Tell him your feelings and reasons. Offer a compromise like video call. What he decides to do is up to him. \n\nMaybe he has never had to make a hard choice between his family and you/your new family. It\u2019s normal to figure out new priorities. My partner\u2019s family asked us to drive 2 hours in dangerous weather with a state warning to stay off the roads, and multiple wrecks, to make a family holiday. My partner struggled with that decision even though it seemed ridiculous to me. I told him my boundary- I\u2019m not going in dangerous weather, and that I\u2019d be sad and worried, but it\u2019s his choice what he does.

You\u2019re a soon-to-be mother for the first time so nerves and anxiety about it is completely understandable.

So judgement is a little clouded by this.\n\nBut your husband needs to recognise that going may mean that he misses the birth.\n\nThe other consideration is how good a support person is he going to be?  Some dads are brilliant... but will there be a distance because he wasn't 'allowed' to make a choice to go to the graduation?  Oh he'll be excited that his child is being born... but being excited about a birth and being a good support person for the labouring mother are two different things.\n\nI completely get why you want him him not to go at the gestation you will be.  But by the arguments that I've seen on here... basically the dad can't leave the mom's side for the entire pregnancy because they could have a baby at any point.  You could miscarry early.  You could break your waters at 20 weeks.  You could develop a serious condition that requires an immediate C/S which had never even been thought about.\n\nWhat if you are still pregnant over 40 weeks gestation?  What sort of animosity will there be then.  It could be that the graduation ends up being almost a month before the child is born.\n\nI don't know what the rest of your relationship is like but would this then become the straw that breaks the camels back and you end up doing shared care with the child 50:50 because you are no longer together.\n\nYour husband may also be a bit of an arse too where he tells you what he's doing with no correspondence entered into.  If that's the case then you have bigger problems.\n\nSit down with him and rationally discuss this.  He needs to be aware that his choices will have consequences and he needs to be comfortable with those.  The consequences may be missing the birth... but even if he doesn't miss the birth and you don't go into labour for weeks.. what sort of impacts will this have on your relationship?\n\nI have a partner where his family seems to take precedence over anyone else and especially anyone in my family.

Now I know that I can't change that and although I've accepted it.. it still really irritates me.  We live 5-6 hours of drive away so we aren't taking day trips!

More like my 200 dollars actually, because I have a lot to say about this OP.\n\nThe niece is an orphan. Her dad, the fiance's brother, died when she was a baby. Her mom died recently, in the last couple of months. This gives a lot more explanation as to why the fiance feels so strongly about attending.\n\nI know you've included the parents being dead in your comment, but OP actually didn't allow her fiance to attend the mom's funeral. She would've only been, what, 25 - 30 weeks pregnant? She hasn't mentioned having any sort of difficulties, just that she \"wasn't feeling well\" and that the niece's mom isn't actually related to him anymore (since the brother is dead) so it doesn't matter. OP herself should've gone to the funeral with her fiance.\n\nNot only all of that, OP says her mom and sister live nearby and she's close to them, so it's not as if it's an estranged relationship. One of them can stay with her for the night, problem solved. But no, that's not enough for OP.\n\nThis might get downvoted and I know a lot of people are going to say I'm going off topic, and it doesn't matter what happened before and whether he went to the funeral before. It matters because it shows the lead up of events.\n\nAnd even after all this if people think this behavior is acceptable, I'd say YTA only because she didn't initially include any of this info. \n\nShe edited in how long the drive will be, but not a shred of this. So why not OP? I'll give you grace and say you originally forgot to put it in, but now you can edit. So why not do that, unless you're just trying to make yourself look good?", "The comments may be heartless because the OP hid all that information in comments outside of the original post. While she was fine editing in all these information that help her case, she still hasn't edit all this important information about the family because she knows it make her look bad.

So her mom not only had to deal with an infant totally alone, she was also grieving the loss of her husband. While going through a lot of hormonal changes in her body.

It's not unusual. I didn't know for sure until 36 weeks as they did some BP rechecks, etc. I didn't catch how far out from the graduation this is, but things can change fast in that last month til estimated due date.\n\nOP is NTA either way. It's not an asshole move to be scared of giving birth by yourself, of having your partner not be there, etc. Birth is always a death risk for the woman and the baby. Often, things go well. But there's a reason many people give birth in a hospital. There's a reason people don't give birth on their own. Even people doing home births have a medical professional of some sort attend to assist them. \n\nThat said, your point about fiancee being close family, possibly near father figure for niece is relevant. That calls for compromise and consideration. But, it doesn't make OP an ass for wanting things to be least stressful and have her fiancee nearby at end of pregnancy. If she's stressed by him being gone, I'm pretty sure that can actually increase chances of her giving birth then slightly. Stress does things to you when pregnant. Things like experiencing early contractions and early labor. \n\nIdeally, compromise may be worth considering, if there is a suitable backup birth support. If there is no suitable backup birth support, I'd have told my husband no too. If there is, then make plans like he can go, and finalize the decision after her doc appointment checkup that week, couple days in advance. The doc can get a good idea at that point how close OP is likely to give birth soon or not. If doc says, well, it could be within next week based on xyz, agree he won't go and both of you call niece to explain. (Or better yet, call niece ahead of time to discuss this plan so niece understands this possibility and isn't blindsided.) If doc says, no signs of labor yet, probably still have more than a week left, then fiancee goes. Make sure backup person is prepared, etc. \n\nThat said, I'd have said no too. My husband wasn't farther than an hour from me for that whole last month or two. I would have been extremely uncomfortable with anyone who lived nearby as a backup person. Labor is messy and personal and private. And it's hard enough having all these medical strangers there. You need someone you trust completely. \n\nGraduation is important, certainly, but it's NOT life or death. Pregnancy and labor actually are. NTA for your choice here OP, not at all. You can both support niece from afar, and celebrate before or after the event. Do more than send a gift. It sounds like niece is very close to your fiancee, and if you don't understand that and show you support that, that is the AH behavior.", "It's one way to get people to agree with you lmao.", "> about to be left alone by her mate?\n\nI'm sorry, when did we enter fan fiction territory?", "I was NAH but OPs comments certainly make me this she is the AH.\n\nI don't disagree with anything you've said though.

Because your fiance was \"not related to\" his sister in law? His niece has no parents left and your fiance was likely wanting to go support her through that. Him not being there for the funeral is possibly a factor in him really wanting to go to the graduation now. \n\nWhen you all get married, that's your niece too. She has no parents left.

I would recruit the person you feel closest with to spend the night to support you as a backup plan, and encourage your fiance to not linger because of your own concerns and fears. \n\nIf he doesn't go, and a problem doesn't pop up - as it most likely will not - he's probably going to think \"I should have been there for my niece.\" Again.", "YTA", "YTA because you are literally hiding information.

I'm not saying it WON'T happen, but it's quite unlikely. For a decision like this, it's important to compare the possible outcomes AND how likely they are. I think most of us would agree that missing the birth would be worse than missing the graduation. But, if he doesn't go to the graduation, there is a 100% chance he will miss it. If he does go, there is a much smaller (I don't know what it is numerically, but it's small) chance that he will miss the birth. There is no one right answer to which of those is the right decision, because it depends on just how bad each of those outcomes seems to him.

My dad missed my sister's birth - she came out so fast that he was still trying to park the car.  Military fathers are sometimes stationed far from their pregnant partners.  Some people simply can't manage to stay within an hour of each other for three months. The world doesn't end.\n\nIf your fiance wanted a party weekend, I'd say he should suck it up, stay home, and take care of his growing family. That isn't worth the risk of being absent when you need him.

In OP\u2019s situation, 37 weeks is admittedly even dicier, and I completely get deciding for herself not to attend.  The end of pregnancy can be brutally exhausting. But with the additional info on the fianc\u00e9s family, I think being supportive of the niece here is very warranted.  It\u2019s only risky that you go into labor early, but it\u2019s very likely that he\u2019d be able to get back in plenty of time if he left immediately after hearing about it.
