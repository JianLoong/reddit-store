Ask your fianc\u00e9 what his plan is if you go into labor while he\u2019s away, and ask him how he\u2019ll feel if he misses the birth of his first child bc he\u2019s stuck in graduation traffic. \n\nAfter that, he gets to make his own decision. Make sure you have a backup partner for the night he\u2019s gone.", "INFO You\u2018re at 34 weeks now, the ceremony is in a couple of weeks and a few hours away. You need to be more precise: \n-\tHow long is the drive? Two hours or few hours are both a few hours. \n-\tHow far along are you when the ceremony is? Are there any warning signs pointing to a premature birth? Sure, early labor happens, but not *that* often without any warning signs.", "NTA. You\u2019ll be 37 weeks with your first and he\u2019s having an overnight stay 6 hours away. Plenty of babies come at 37 weeks. You\u2019re his heavily pregnant wife and you\u2019re nervous about being alone. That should be reason enough.", "NAH. Neither of you want something unreasonable. Maybe the two of you could wait a few days before the graduation to make a final decision.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say NTA. In other comments, you've clarified that it's a 5-6 hour drive, and you'd be about 37 weeks pregnant. I wouldn't recommend you go. Your husband needs to be there for you if you go into labor. I'm not sure why so many people seem to think that all pregnancies go to 40 weeks. It's incredibly common to give birth earlier. I had both of mine at 36 weeks. I understand this will probably be upsetting to your husband, but he needs to prioritize you. Being without him for 5-6 hours if you were to go into labor with your first child would be very stressful. I'm sure I'll get down voted for this, but I just don't think you're in the wrong for being worried.", "NTA  My water broke at 4am, waking me up.  My son was delivered at 7am.\n\nI was 37 weeks.", "You\u2019re NTA. You\u2019re currently 34 weeks, graduation is in 2 weeks, would require a stay over. Average length of pregnancy is 40 weeks, and 4 week early births aren\u2019t unheard of. \n\nMore info needed to determine if he\u2019s an AH: is the niece otherwise unsupported? Will she have other family there?", "NTA Yeah, that's cutting it pretty close to your due date. Anything week 36 and above he should really be around to support you. 37 complete weeks is considered full gestation. I'm on your side, here. I think you need to be firm about this and make sure you explain your concerns about your approaching due date. If he agrees, he respects you. If not, well, then I'm sorry. Best wishes not just for the convo, but the delivery as well!", "Look, a lot of people send college invites to get gifts, they don\u2019t expect you to attend unless you\u2019re super close to them. NTA", "NTA. 5-6 hours drive and 37 weeks by the graduation date is risky and pushing it. People here all sound like assholes.", "NTA- I wouldn't want to go into labor in a totally unfamiliar location HOURS away from home. All of my major laboring for my 2 kids was done at home, with all my comforts, in my own way. I would NEVER want to labor more than a few minutes in a car!! (Yes I'm lucky enough to live within a 5- 15 minute drive to my hospital of choice) But labor sucks already, why add to your discomfort? You have been creating a whole human for the last 10 months (yes it's said to be 9 but come on, 40 weeks is 10 months), you deserve every comfort you desire at this point.\nEdit: corrected spelling", "If you will end up being all alone, then NTA. It's your first child and you need someone to attend to you when your water broke. Some may say, there's a low chance of you giving birth - but still, there's a small chance that you will. \n\nAsk him what he will do if you suddenly gave birth while he's gone. Think of a solution whatever he will answer.\n\nAnd you said \"fianc\u00e9\". If my partner do this to me, I will definitely keep him as a bf, not a husband. You're clearly not one of his top priorities, even you're vulnerable. Just something to think about.", "I went into labour 17 days early and ended up having an emergency C section with my first.  I would have preferred hubby not to be so far away from 36 or 37 weeks.\n\nNTA - your fianc\u00e9 is  cutting it fine.  And niece is old enough to understand that it's cutting it fine.", "Info: how many weeks will you be on the day? How many hours  away is it? are you high risk? Is this your first child? Is there someone who could stay with you for the day? Is he particularly close to his niece?\n\nIt's giving NAH based on current info. it's understandable you want him near but it's also understandable for him to want to go if that's a way to plan for him to be reachable.", "NTA", "INFO - how many weeks exactly?\n\nI'm leaning towards NAH. I understand being anxious about your first labour - but I don't think your partner is wrong for wanting to go to the graduation.\n\nMy husband is a FIFO worker and was away when I went into labour early with my first pregnancy. He had to wait for tickets and everything and took eight hours to get home and still made it in time. In fact it was another eight hours after he arrived before I birthed my eldest. It's extremely unlikely your fiance would miss your labour with only three hours to travel. It's also not as common for first time mother's to go into labour super early so I wouldn't stress too much.\n\nDo you have family/friends close by who you and your partner can organise staying over for the night he's gone? I stayed with my mother whilst my husband was away in the last couple of weeks of pregnancy and she was the one who took me to the hospital when I went into labour early.", "I would say NTA. From the comments I read from you you will be 37 weeks pregnant and going for a 5-6 drive to and fro. And it's your first born. Your emotions are running high due to what your body is going through and being without your partner for any amount of time is definitely scary. However, not everyone makes it to 40 weeks especially with no prior births to compare to. Your husband wants to support his niece which is completely valid, but you should come up with a compromise.", "NTA, I went into labor at 38 weeks exactly with my first baby and had gone in several times with contractions through my 37th week. My water broke at 38 weeks exactly. If my husband hadn\u2019t been home I would have been even more of an anxious wreck than I was. I started having early labor signs at 36 weeks when baby dropped and would consistently have contractions for hours that would just stop. Being 6 hours from home is not something I\u2019d ever do past maybe 34 weeks. Could you do a trip early to congratulate his niece or maybe take her out to dinner? Zoom link to the ceremony? Meet and greet with baby/graduation party? Any number of things that don\u2019t take your partner 6 hours away this close to the end of your pregnancy.", "Can't believe all these Y T A comments. Babies do come early and OP has a valid concern. Around that time it's really dangerous to even risk traveling while that heavily pregnant. Even when I was 37 weeks pregnant with our son, I didn't want to risk traveling either. However, OP's fiance wants to go support his niece, and graduations are a pretty huge once-in-a-lifetime event so I completely understand why he wants to go also. Really NAH in this situation because I see both sides. OP you're in a tough spot and I hope you and your fiance are able to come to a decision soon! If you both don't go then definitely send a gift, and if your fiance does go just make sure you have someone by your side in case you do go into labor while he's gone!", "NAH you want him here and he wants to go.\n\nIf you make him stay and you dont go into labour will he resent you? If he goes and you do go into labour will you resent him? \n\nHas he given you any idea of what he plans to do if you go into labour? Does he plan on drinking whilst celebrating which would limit his ability to get back to you? Do you have a support network around you that you can call on if he is not there and you go into labour?\n\nDoes niece have parents/grandparents that will be at the graduation so she is not alone?\n\nYou and husband need to look at all the variables and decide between you both what risk you are willing to accept. is he willing to deal with possibly missing supporting you through labour and the birth if you go earlier", "NTA. Ask your doctor whether it's safe to travel in your condition and if there's a possibility of early childbirth. However, I say NTA because your fiance should be prioritizing his fiancee and his child, not his niece.", "NAH. It's your FIRST baby. Of course you want your partner by your side in case you go into early labour or, god forbid, in case there are complications. While yes, early labour is not the most likely scenario for a first time mum, it can and does happen. \n\nMost pregnant women try to make sure to have their spouse / partner around them alert and sober for the weeks leading up to their due date. I understand why your fiance wants to see his niece graduate, but could you both live with him missing the birth of his child?", "NTA\u2014 that\u2019s a long way away for your partner to be that close to your due date. I\u2019m seeing a lot of \u201cfirst baby labor\u201d is longer\u2014 which a) is not always the case and b) it\u2019s reasonable to want your partner there for the whole labor experience. That\u2019s putting you, who is heavily pregnant, in a very anxiety inducing situation.", "NTA\n\nBirth at 36 weeks is full term where I live and 5-6 hours away is a lot.", "NAH.  I don\u2019t blame him for wanting to be there for his niece- in fact hopefully it shows that he\u2019ll be a good dad that he has such a close relationship with her.  However, a lot can happen at that point in pregnancy.  \n\nI went into labor at 37 weeks with my first after I encouraged my husband to go on a visit to his home country, which is a 24 hour flight away.  It was to grieve a lost family member, and I thought it was important that he go to get closure and support.  I was texting him from his first layover on his way home, when my water broke.  He must have gotten on the next flight minutes before I texted him, so he didn\u2019t see it until his next layover, 12 hours later.  Thankfully, I was in labor for 24 hours and he had already done the first stretch of the trip home before my water broke, so he made it to the hospital in the middle of the night, and our baby came in the morning, so it all worked out.  But it was really stressful.  Also, my pregnancy was perfectly healthy until about a week before I went into labor, when it suddenly wasn\u2019t and my doctor told me I had to stop working immediately and stay off my feet.  I don\u2019t blame you for wanting him nearby just in case.", "NAH this is new for all of you. Maybe get the drs opinion with him and make a decision based off that. Or ask a trusted older parent for their input", "NAH. Although graduations are universally awful and the people who insist they exist ARE terrible people.\n\nWhat's nice here is that it doesn't sound like either of you is trying to hurt the other. That's so rare on AITA.\n\nI think you two should compromise and play it by ear. Get input from a doctor on how likely you actually are to pop closer to the graduation. You didn't mention being high risk or living somewhere where no one is nearby to help, so your fear is understandable but likely just normal nerves.\n\nIf the doc says you're in a good place and the baby shouldn't come early, just have an agreement that his phone stays on and that he answers it (even via text if he's actively at the graduation). Have a local friend be your \"backup.\" I've played that role even when the husband WAS there because he was too freaked out! If possible, he could also see if a relative would drive back with him if something happens so he can focus on staying in contact while they drive.\n\nThis could be your last couple of days with the house to yourself for a while, too. I'd take advantage of it if you can!\n\nYou're not wrong. He's not wrong, either. I think you can get this taken care of with minimal bruised feelings. Good luck!", "INFO: is video calling in an option? That might be a good compromise, since he would both be able to support her and stay close by for your peace of mind/in case something happens.", "NTA\n\nNICU and cross trained L&D RN here. At almost 37 weeks, I wouldn't be okay with my husband being a 5-6 hour drive away. A LOT can happen (labor wise) in that time frame. Working in L&D, I see just about as many 37 weekers come in as I do 40 weekers. Baby is going to come when baby decides and due dates can be off an average of 2 weeks. \n\nIn the NICU we tend to be more nervous about a 37 week delivery than a 36, 35, or even 34 week one. Babies born at 37 weeks like to show out and not breathe.", "I do understand both sides of the situation.\n\nHe wants to be there for his niece\u2019s graduation.\n\nYou want him to be there since you\u2019re near the end of your pregnancy.\n\nYea it\u2019s a tough one\u2014do you have a close friend/parent that can stay with you while he is gone, in case anything we\u2019re to happen? \n\nIf there is someone, then I honestly would just let him be there for his niece\u2019s graduation. \n\nIt\u2019s not like he sees her on a daily basis, right? \n\nSo I would just let him go\u2026I would kind of feel guilty to tell him not to go\u2026I don\u2019t know that\u2019s just my personal opinion.", "I went into labour at 37.5 weeks, first pregnancy, no risk factors detected. It happens.", "NTA.  It\u2019s not your job to be understanding. It\u2019s his job to stay close by.", "YTA - I'll get to the point. Not wanting to travel yourself at 36ish weeks is valid, but unless you're leaving something out of the story, there's no real reason to expect that you will be among the 10% of people who spontaneously go into early labor at 36 weeks.\n\n\"A few hours drive away\" is vague, but if your ~~husband~~ fiance NEEDS to turn around and come back to you because you do, in fact, go into early labor, he can do that.\n\nLet him go support his niece. Stay home and enjoy some quiet time.", "NTA", "I'm surprised by all the Y T A comments. 37 weeks is well within the normal range.\n\nOP might not have someone who can stay with her over night to take her to the hospital if she goes into labor. Labor is painful, making it hard to drive herself or take other means of transportation.    \n\n\nIs there *really* a reason niece needs your partner to be there? People are saying its odd that OP would want her partner to support her during a really scary time. But is it really that common or expected that an uncle attends a graduation?\n\nNTA.", "NAH\nBoth positions are equally valid. You are unlikely to go into labour, but worried about it, he wants to be present for family when he himself will be making more family  (this is your child's relative, and you will want aunts and uncles to celebrate your child). You will just have to talk it out, there will be a lot more talks like this in your future.", "INFO: what's the bond or relationship between your fiance and his niece? Is there special meaning to either of them that he attends?", "NAH. I think both people here have a valid point, and since it is unlikely to go into labor I get your husband's pov. However, it isn't so uncommon that you can be confident it won't happen so you also aren't being unreasonable here. I'd say that you could ask a parent or a friend to be over while he's gone for a couple days just in case you go into labor and let him go for those couple days. Hopefully you won't go into labor, but in case you do, it'd be good to have someone around.", "Have you asked him what his plan is if you go in to labour? How he will feel missing the birth of his child potentially.\n\nNTA your husband is a dummy", "NTA - you'll be at term and he want's to be 6 hours away , that's ridiculous. As it's your first you have no idea if you'll go before 40 weeks or not and he needs to be available", "I gave birth at 36 weeks.. it happens", "Slight YTA.  A few hours\u2019 drive away is very doable for him.  Even if you were to go into labor while he was away, the odds that you would have the baby in the few hours it would take him to drive home are exceedingly slim.  It\u2019s not like he as to fly and is dependent upon airlines schedules to get home.  If you call him and need him to get home, he just hops in the car and leaves.", "NTA I was going to vote the other way but the additional information changed my mind. You'll be much closer to giving birth by the time and 6 hours is a long way away for something none essential.", "NTA although I can see why he wants to go as its not about a gift card but his presence there that the niece wants. If possible it might be worth having a family or friend over to keep you company while he makes the trip as it would be a win win. Else it might result in bad blood later on and is best avoided if it can be.", "Info: do you want him to stay with you because you don\u2019t want to be alone or because you are worried he might miss the birth?", "NTA / NAH. You are completely right to say what you do or don't feel comfortable with doing in your final month of pregnancy. If you really wanted, you could talk to your doctor about it, but again, it's what your comfortable with. Graduations are also long and crowded and the venue might be outside in uncomfortable chairs or inside where you have to climb a bunch of stairs for seating. Not sure of the exact  situation with fiance's niece but just pointing out that it's different from going to, say, a restaurant or a party at a family home where the bathrooms are really close. But I digress, because again, it's your say what you feel okay or dont feel okay doing. \n\nBut your fiance should be able to go if he wants. It is not that far away if you go in to labor or if there is some kind of issue or emergency. You shouldn't forbid him from going 'just in case', that isn't fair just like him saying you have to go wouldn't be fair either. \n\nSo just let each other live on this and congratulations on your baby. :-)", "NTA, his pregnant wife and baby need to be his top focus. Send money to his niece with a nice card. How he doesn\u2019t see that you need to be his #1 priority is beyond me, but he is being extremely callous.", "NTA. Your fiance should know that you're his priority, not his niece.  \nEven if its close by, you shouldn't be stuck in a car for a 5 hour plus drive.  \nI'll tell ya, from my culture, you wouldn't even be allowed out of the bedroom (for confinement) let alone go for a drive that long.  \nI'm going to be blunt, is money involved?", "YTA. A few hours out of one day, weeks before you are due? You can't give him that? Is he by your side 24 hours a day? What happens when he goes to work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week? How does that work?", "NTA dad should be around because at this point the baby can come at any moment. If you have someone to stay with you,and he don't mind missing he birth of his first child, let him go. But for the most part he should be on alert for when you go into labor.", "I don\u2019t think so. You deserve the support rn. Enjoy the last time you have together as just the two of you.", "NTA 36 weeks isn\u2019t unheard of and you\u2019ll be huge and exhausted by then. 5 hours is a long time to get anywhere if you go into labour.", "NTA. I assume the niece has other people to attend her ceremony, like parents and/or other relatives? Your husband doesn't \"have\" to go, just because she asked. I absolutely understood that a close relative didn't come to my wedding because his wife was about 36 weeks pregnant at that time.", "YTA. As long as your fiance has a plan to get home if he needs to, I think it's ok for him to go. It's clearly important to him that he's there for his niece. Labor at 36-37W is uncommon. \n\nHowever, I think it would be better if you go with him. I'm currently 39W pregnant, and wouldn't have had a problem leaving town for something like this at 36-37ish weeks. In fact, I went to an out of town wedding a few days ago at 38W4. I just made a plan to get home quickly as well as doing research on some options for emergency care at the destination. Personally, I'd rather be with my partner if something went wrong than alone at home but that's up to you.", "I get that he wants to support his niece but his pregnant wife who could give birth any day by that point has gotta come first. If you\u2019re not comfortable then he shouldn\u2019t go. NTA.", "YTA", "YTA if you don't try to make a reasonable plan before telling him not to go. Do you have your Mom or a close friend that could stay the night with you just in case? Can he agree to always have his phone in hand in case you call and be ready to jump in the car immediately if needed? The chance of you going into labor at 37 weeks is low but still there. I wouldn't want my DH to miss an important graduation if he is close to his niece and I can make sure that I had support and a plan just in case. If you do not have someone that could stay with you or be \"on call\" close by while he is gone then it is a different story and I would say NTA", "YTA\n\nGoing to a graduation is not gonna hurt anything. Also he\u2019s his own person and can decide if he wants to go or not. He does not have to answer to you", "Yta its a few hours drive which means he can come back pretty easily if anything happens. Also , most first time pregnancies go past the 40-week mark you're literally a month and a half away from 40 weeks. And also same goes for going with him there... its a few hours away, worst case scenario there are hospitals in other cities.  You didn't say anything about a high risk pregnancy so I'm not really sure what exactly you think is going to happen to you by riding in a car \"in your condition\". I have a one year old daughter, when i was pregnant with her I was working as a Machinist in a metal shop until 37 weeks, and i did have pregnancy complications, and it was still fine", "As you can tell by the comment section, this is not an easy one to judge. And ultimately it doesn\u2019t matter: you and your husband need to find common ground, you\u2019re about to become parents. \n\nDepending on how you feel and how comfortable you are in the car, I would advise you to go together. 37 weeks is not too close. Show your support, let everyone ooh and aah over your belly, enjoy a nice hotel and then head back. \n\nChances are slim your baby will decide to pop out right in the middle of the valedictorian speech. And if it does, that\u2019s a funny birth story.", "NTA- her parents should go,why can\u2019t you just see her virtually or take her a gift after the birth?!sorry but baby comes first,if you were miles away from the hospital and the birth doesn\u2019t go as planned would your husband be able to forgive himself??there\u2019s no reason he can\u2019t go alone and rush back if you go into labour,you don\u2019t need a carer", "NTA. Why is he so intent on going to a graduation? No one is dying. It\u2019s a graduation. Your husband needs a serious reality check.", "NTA. For heaven's sake it's a graduation ceremony not a Presidential inauguration, just how much \"support\" does she need? Right now he has one clear responsibility: you and your pregnancy. This should not need to be pointed out to him.", "[deleted]", "YTA. He should be able to be gone several hours, as long as he is reachable to come home in the extremely unlikely event something were to happen.", "NTA, for a few reasons really. It\u2019s entirely possible you\u2019ll go into Labour early, even if you don\u2019t there could be issues like pre eclampsia/reduced movement etc that mean you have to go in to hospital. \n\nThe angry reason - it\u2019s the f***ing least he can do. Growing a baby is not easy, Labour is not easy and the fourth trimester with possible PND and feeding issues is a minefield. All he has to do is miss a bloody graduation to support you.", "YTA, I think?\n\nI dunno it sounds like you just aren\u2019t in the mood to do it that far along pregnant, not so much it being a bad/risky idea. \n\nBut like, you can just say you don\u2019t want to because it\u2019s a lot. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that. You don\u2019t have to suffer an uncomfortable trip for a graduation.", "YTA - being pregnant doesn't automatically make you special and you can't ban your husband from going to his niece's graduation, which is obviously important to them both.", "NTA I had my first baby at 37 weeks. 36 weeks is considered full time, from that point on it could happen any day. Labour sucks and you\u2019ll need him by your side. The only way I could see it working is if you work out which hospital you\u2019ll go to if you do go into labour while you\u2019re away at this graduation.", "NTA.\nOur first kid was born at 37 weeks, my water broke 1.5 day after a check up during which the doctor was like \"nah, nothing's happening soon\". No way I would be comfortable with my husband being 5-6 hours away at this point of a pregnancy or sitting in a car for 5-6 hours myself (and researching hospitals in the graduation area in case labour starts there).", "NTA, a baby can come at any time, have problems unforseen, my son had the cord around his neck and I would want my husband there. My husband was there for the C section....cut the cord.. We wanted that.", "NTA I\u2019m pregnant for the first time as well, and I get very panicky if my husband is not around at all times.

It\u2019s not even a wedding", "NTA - you and your husband wouldn't forgive yourselves if he missed the birth especially when you're reaching out to ask this question. Regardless it's 'less likely to give birth so early ' you still could and that is the point, everybody is different! It'll start a slippery slope of it always in your mind.

He came running into the Operating room with scrubs rushed on. She decided to make an entrance a month early. I know what it\u2019s like.", "NTA. First pregnancy can be scary, and having/wanting your partner there is completely reasonable.

My fiance's niece has her college graduation ceremony coming up in a couple of weeks. She invited both of us, but I said I can't really go in my condition. It's a few hours drive away, so we would have to stay overnight at least.\n\nMy fiance is saying he needs to go even if I don't, to support her because she asked us. I said we can send her a gift, but it's better if he stays with me since I'm near the end of the pregnancy.\n\nWe've been going back and forth/argued on this, and he said I wasn't being understanding.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

We are not you or your fianc\u00e9. Some people  would be totally fine cool as cucumbers, others would be totally panicked as comes through in the comments.  It is up to you both to decide what is right by you. I do suggest not using right or wrong statements  rather be honest and open. I need you, I am not comfortable being here alone without you etc. This time is special and a good time to get on the same page because once baby is born you are a team and other people will have a lot of opinions.", "NAH - I can see both sides here.\n\nI can understand him wanting to celebrate his niece's graduation.  That's a big milestone event for her.\nI can also understand you not wanting to travel too far, and wanting him to be there for you when the time comes.\n\nDo you have any family history of going into labour before the due dates?  Any family history of fast labours?  The average first labour is 24 hours - my first labour lasted 42.5, my sister-in-law's first took even longer.\n\nI was at family weddings days before giving birth to each of my children (both times, they were the same weekend I was actually due!)\n\nThe first was close to home; I walked further than the venue whilst in labour!  We had hospital bags etc in the car, just in case.\nMy due date was the following day, and I woke up to contractions.  That was the Sunday - I didn't give birth until the Tuesday.\n\nWith the second wedding, that was around 2 or 3 hours away from home (in Leicester, whilst we live to the northeast of Cambridge).  I didn't absolutely commit until the day before, as I wasn't sure if I'd feel up to it - my parents would've taken my then 4 year old (who was a flower girl) if I hadn't felt up to going.\nThat time, I didn't give birth until I'd reached 5 days overdue - and my labour was 10 hours that time.", "NTA... but you should let him go to the graduation and have a backup support system for the 2 days when he's gone. Should anything happen during that time, engage your backup and then call him to come meet you in the hospital.", "NTA\n\nSend a card and gift. His niece should be understanding. See if they are live streaming the ceremony. If so, he could attend virtually. Aside from you possibly going into labor, there's the whole Covid thing that is not gone, just out of the news. It wouldn't be a great time to go hang out in a crowd of the unwashed masses.", "NTA.. As someone who got a randomly high pressure in week 36 and had to get induced asap, I am really surprised by all the YTA votes. Pregnancy, especially towards the end and especially first time is a time of uncertainty. I would feel very anxious if my partner wasn\u2019t within a driving distance in case of an emergency.", "NTA. Does your fiance care more about his niece's graduation than his own **impending fatherhood**?", "NTA.\n\nMy mum always says that I (eldest) was born neatly on my due date, and it took 2 hours between her rocking up to ER and me wailing my first wail.\n\nNot just that but there might be complications. It wouldn't be the first time bad things happen and the nearly-mum might not be conscious to make healthcare decisions. The first reason for another person to be present at the birth is so that there's someone who can make decisions in case mum passes out or has to be put under general anaesthesia. (The second reason is moral support and to provide a hand to squeeze)", "NAH, I think, because he's not an AH for wanting to attend and you're certainly not for wanting your partner there for the delivery. \n\nUnless he's somehow the primary support for his niece (in which case this is out of Reddit's paygrade), I'm inclined to say your desires ought to win out here. You are carrying his child after all, and labor at 37 weeks is hardly unheard of.", "NAH. (or NTA)\n\nA pregnancy is considered full term if birth falls between 37 to 42 weeks of the estimated last menstruation date.\n\nOnly about 4 % of women actually give birth on their actual due date.\n\nYour husband just does not understand! Giving birth is a big deal and trumps his niece\u2019s graduation. Many things can happen so close to birth and he should be available. \n\nSend a gift and check if you can watch the graduation digitally. \n\nYour husband is an asshole if he does not yield after being explained the importance of him being present to support you during this life altering time.", "NTA. It\u2019s not really about the exact number of hours or weeks. You\u2019re heavily pregnant with his child, uncomfortable being far from him or your hospital, and he\u2019s being insensitive. \n\nBut you can\u2019t tell him what to do. There\u2019s no point in fighting. Tell him your feelings and reasons. Offer a compromise like video call. What he decides to do is up to him. \n\nMaybe he has never had to make a hard choice between his family and you/your new family. It\u2019s normal to figure out new priorities. My partner\u2019s family asked us to drive 2 hours in dangerous weather with a state warning to stay off the roads, and multiple wrecks, to make a family holiday. My partner struggled with that decision even though it seemed ridiculous to me. I told him my boundary- I\u2019m not going in dangerous weather, and that I\u2019d be sad and worried, but it\u2019s his choice what he does. He ultimately decided not to go and has been more confident since. \n\nUnfortunately he needs to figure this out and I hope he doesn\u2019t learn the hard way by missing his child\u2019s birth or losing some of your trust/respect for being insensitive.", "So a completely different issue.

You could go early, but it's doubtful you will. 5-6 hours isn't that far, he can come back.", "NAH - I can see both sides and honestly nobody is right or wrong.  You\u2019re a soon-to-be mother for the first time so nerves and anxiety about it is completely understandable.  However, 36weeks doesn\u2019t mean you will give birth, and this event is for someone who your fianc\u00e9 clearly wants to support, which I don\u2019t think he is wrong or an asshole for doing.  The variety in responses on here suggests as much.", "Neither are assholes. It\u2019s ok if you don\u2019t want to travel, but it\u2019s not fair to force him not to go. Plus a few hours away isn\u2019t even that far. Early labour can last a couple of days especially for a first time birth. It\u2019s not usually as rapid and dramatic as they make it out on TV. Even if you did happen to be one of the 3% who have a precipitous labour (figure is even less at 37 weeks AND for first time pregnancy) , he\u2019d realistically have plenty of time to make it back.", "NTA. I went into spontaneous labour at 36+5 weeks. No indications that I\u2019d have a late pre-term baby. I was super well, no complications. We weren\u2019t ready! We still hadn\u2019t picked up our spare mattress from our mates place for me to birth on. You just never know when it will happen.

I went in for my regular on appointment by myself at 37 weeks and gave my urine sample. She came back and said elevator down to L&D bc I was pre-eclamptic and baby needed to get here today. \n\nCalled husband and he obviously came from work and the rest is history. \n\nBut this pregnancy has ZERO red flags, concerns, or problems until that moment. \n\nNo, pregnant women DONT need coddled or to have their partners glued to them.

He said \u201cwe have to go bc she invited us\u201d is not \u201cI\u2019m her surrogate type parent who\u2019s helped raise her and she needs me to be there for the final leg after all her struggles and successes\u201d\n\nIt sounds like he just feels like he\u2019s gotta go to events if they\u2019re invited and like it\u2019s almost a mandatory summons on cardstock.", "My family has a habit of being early (my first one was born at 36 weeks, the second one 37 and my sisters kids were also around the 36 week mark) so it's all possible near the end. Given the timing, it's def NTA. You come first during this time and being 5-6 hours away is not a great idea to put it lightly", "Agreed, he shouldn\u2019t be going anywhere and leaving her without some sort of support in case she does go into labor or anything goes wrong. After that, if he\u2019s willing to potentially miss the birth of his child, that\u2019s his choice.\n\nEdit: Have now seen that OP has close family in the area, and that her niece was recently orphaned! Given the circumstances I completely understand her husbands point of view.", "Yeah, I just hate getting stuck in that damn graduation traffic.", "But what about how she will fee if he misses it? How he feels about missing the labour is secondary to how she would feel not having his support.", "Drive is 5-6 hours depending on traffic. I'll be almost 37 weeks", "Two is a couple. A few is three or more.", "Yeah and when it does it's not like your first labour is short. I actually did go into labour early whilst my husband was away. We called and it took him eight hours to get home (he had to fly) and it took another eight hours after he arrived before our baby came. I just stayed with family on the tail end of the pregnancy, so they were with me til he got there. I mean.. my mum was gonna be there regardless.\n\n**Edit to add I'm aware not everyone has a long first labour. You're just statistically pretty likely to have a labour that's less time than OPs husband will take to drive home if she goes into labour.", "First baby, at that.", "This is the most reasonable response, IMO. I\u2019m 35 weeks now, and I have zero signs of labor coming. My husband could go a few hours away and I wouldn\u2019t even care. \n\nMost doctors will check cervical length and firmness around 36 weeks. If things aren\u2019t looking urgent, let husband go.

Luckily the baby is doing swell, its just the husk thats carrying it that is getting worn down haha!", "Yeah. YTA.", "YTA for not including this very relevant information in the post.\n\nThis family member is orphaned.  She just lost her mother a few months ago.", "Pretty convenient you left that one out", "Whoa, this is a completely different situation now. Now i get why he wants to go so badly.\nIn this situation, i would let the husband go, especially bcs you have your mom amd sister nearby eho could help you out. I was with my sister when she gavr birth bcs her husband couldn't.", "Do you have support other than your fiance?\n\nEta: you have your mum and sister. You should let him go. Most likely you won't go into labour and if you do, you will most likely take more than 6hrs.\n\nI would also consider if sticking to not letting him go might actually build some resentment if you do not go into early labour. Supporting his orphan niece is a pretty important thing.", "In another comment, you also said your mother and sister are local. You wouldn't be by yourself until he could get home. I think being at the graduation is important to your fianc\u00e9e because his brother is deceased and he's trying to be there in his place.  Your wants are valid, but so are his emotional needs. You're N T A, yet. Why not have a have discussion, along with your fianc\u00e9e, with your OB?", "My water broke in the morning without contractions at 37+3 so I had to be induced. It took a while to kick in but once labour started it was really fast. Like 45 Minutes, they barely got me into delivery room in time and I was still wearing my jeans...

As soon as I saw only nieces grandparents were going I knew information was missing. A bunch of people are still saying he should ditch the niece though. So friggin gross.", "I do. If a medication says 3% of people will experience a stroke from the medication, you may think, it\u2019s only 3%, \u201cmeh\u201d.

I know it works for me sometimes, but that's just my anekdotical experience.", "OP has said Mum and sister are close by. I don't think men are as useful as what we'll think they'll be in labour lol.\n\nCould have done both without my husband there. Not without my Mum.\n\nOmg I didn't see extra information on nieces parents. Kind of leaning towards YTA if that's true. God, I hope he goes there to support her.", "I do get his (and your) POV but this is right near the end of my pregnancy and I'd feel a lot better and more comfortable if he was with me. He also wanted to go to his niece's mom's funeral.", "But you wouldn't be furious at him missing the birth of his child??", "I\u2019m sorry for your loss but that is a separate situation than the one OP outlines.

She is totally TA for that. YTA OP, not because of this event but because of forcing your husband to miss his niece\u2019s last remaining parent\u2019s funeral. You should\u2019ve let him go and maybe he could\u2019ve justified to himself why it\u2019s okay to skip this event. YTA.", "No one is asking you to care. It\u2019s the internet.

It's sad that niece is an orphan (I am too, so I get it), but OP's impending birth is more important for fiance to attend simply because the stakes of not supporting her during labour is much, much higher, including death and disability.\n\nThe grad ceremony is just not that important.", "I feel very privileged. I am the breadwinner in my household so their support to work on my terms in pregnancy and 8 months of paid maternity leave have been essential to allow me to grow my family.\n\n They also continue to promote people, pay into retirement funds and support non birthing partners to take paid leave to care for their newborns as well. So they really do try to support working parents as much as possible.", "Yes, yes and yes.  Apparently a niece's graduation is more important than a his finance giving birth.", "Excellent information thank you.\n\nYTA OP.\n\nHelp your partner work out what he'll do if you go into labour while he's gone. It is unlikely that you will, but best to have a plan. Is it possible for him to fly instead of driving? What route will he take? Where will he stop for petrol? Pack a bag of snacks and water for the way back so he can just get in and go.", "It's not that he's ditching his niece. It's that his first priority has to be to the family he created and is responsible for. The timing of everything absolutely sucks, but the niece can no longer be his first priority.

Was that not a few months ago? \n\nAre you saying he should be more considerate because he did previously go to that? \n\n** I want to make clear I do not think you're the ah here. I just think it's a tough situation and I understand his pov.", "I have to assume the niece is his brother's daughter, because if you just took a round-about way to tell us you didn't let him go to his sister's funeral, that changes everything.", "Lol I'm quoting the OP.

His niece has other family to help and support her through this non-event.", "The niece is definitely having her graduation, the likelihood is that he will be able to make it home before his child is born, and most likely before she goes into labour. So your passionate defence only relates to if she goes into labour on 2 days. Otherwise, he didn't go for no reason. If she does go into labour he went for a reason, knowing she had support nearby and that there was a low chance this would actually happen.", "Nah.. not it.", "It\u2019s not unlikely to go into labor at 37 weeks. She\u2019s nta for being worried he\u2019s gonna miss her giving birth any new mother who\u2019s partner wants to go away would be that way and she just would be the asshole for telling him to not go he has to figure out the family he creates is more important most of the time", "Nah I'm sorry. The chances of something going wrong within less than 24 hours are extremely slim. And my opinion of OP is officially in the ground after realising she intentionally left out such an important bit of context. OP clearly has a real lack of empathy.", "Lmao his kid who is currently unborn? Leaving his wife with her mum and sister for less than 24 hours when the chances of the kid coming early, the kid coming fast and something going wrong all at the same time is so extremely low? Man I would be so proud of my husband if he were to go and support our niece in a situation like that", "Yet it did. So what\u2019s your point? The statistics said all of it was unlikely to happen, let alone all at once, but it still happened.

Oh my god I'm so sad that no one cares about the niece just off the slim chance his wife could go into preterm labour.\n\nY'all are heartless.", "Not wanting him to leave so close to baby popping, totally makes sense. But the way OP worded that \u201che also *wanted* to go to his nieces moms funeral\u201d implies she didn\u2019t allow him to go, also seems that this nieces mother would\u2019ve been Fianc\u00e9\u2019s sister?", "At this point OP is the asshole", "It puts a different principle on the situation.

I really, really hope her Uncle makes the trip.", "Yeah that\u2019s burying the lede for sure, I also saw someone else comment that OP has close family in the area for the night he\u2019d be missing.
