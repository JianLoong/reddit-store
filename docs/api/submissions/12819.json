John and I have been very good friends for almost 2 years now, after I befriended him at work.\n\n6 months ago he met this girl, Cat (19F). He told me about her the day after he matched with her on a dating app, and took me to her workplace to meet her. She seemed very lovely, I was so happy for him.\n\nSince then, John is always inviting her to every friend outing, so I got to know her. We have lots in common, and for John's sake I wanted to be her friend. However, I think that, in the nicest way possible, she is a bit rude. She does art, and half the time John compliments her work shes says \"You hate it, dont you?\". Or times we hang out with other friends we have had to go home early as she was bored, and John was our ride home.\n\nShe hasnt done anything to me personally, but I just dont like her much. Im happy John has found someone he cares for, but having to stand by and watch how she acts sometimes rubs me the wrong way.\n\nHeres where the issue comes in.\n\nYesterday John and I were at the supermarket to do our food shop. Normally, we would buy our food for the week, and maybe a couple of simple/frozen meals to save for Sunday. However, Cat has been coming over for dinners a few times a week and she has a very limited diet. She refuses to eat anything other than fast food or simple/frozen meals. She likely has her reasons for eating specific food, and incase its due to an ED or something similar, I dont want to make things hard for her, or pry into something that isnt my business.\n\nThe time where it becomes an issue for me is how John has now wanted to buy \"back up\" meals for her, incase she doesnt like what we are cooking. This would make sense, as before she has been eating stuff that was part of our weekly meal plan. The problem is John wants me to financially contribute to these extra meals for her.\n\nWhen I spoke to John about this, and said how I am not happy paying half for her meals (our weekly shop cost is just split in half, as we both eat everything) he got quite agitated. He called me selfish for not wanting to help her, just to save money.\n\nI know frozen meals arent the most expensive thing in the world, but John is in a much better financial situation than I am, and while I can pay my share of the bills, and occasionally have outings with friends, I dont want to be dishing out extra money for meals for a girl I have no real connection to, as these small amounts do add up.\nIn my eyes, if Cat doesnt like what we are cooking she could come over a different day, or John could buy back up meals for her out of his own pocket. I feel like an asshole, but I dont think I should be paying for an extra persons food.\n\nIf my bf had a similar situation to Cat, Id see it as my responsibility to provide for him and his diet, and I'd never expect John to pay.\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking this way? Do any of you have any advice?", "created_utc": 1679394869, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xd2g7/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_roommates_gfs/", "score": 2213, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He can't expect OP to help finance the fact that his GF eats like a child and needs \"back up\" meals.  That is their expense alone and perhaps separate shopping is now in order as you two no longer have the same joint priorities. On the flip side, I also wouldn't continue to rely on John as a ride if you constantly want to stay out with friends later.\n\nIt honestly sounds like your life paths are just splitting at this time and it is best to acknowledge that and adjust expectations of each other accordingly before bitterness sets in.  I'd also get ahead of any rent/living concerns sooner rather than later.  If she's sticking around it may be time to start planning an exit strategy.", "NTA.

Simply put. He can call you what he wants, he's still the unreasonable one.  \n\n\n  \nThinking about it shouldn't Cat be paying rent if they're showing up way too often, or at least maybe you should give your landlord a heads up the next time John brings up the idea that you have to pay for Cat's food.", "NTA.

Who cares whether you like the GF or are supportive of their relationship? That has nothing to do with anything here. John is way out of line expecting you to finance his relationship. Period.
