John and I have been very good friends for almost 2 years now, after I befriended him at work.\n\n6 months ago he met this girl, Cat (19F). He told me about her the day after he matched with her on a dating app, and took me to her workplace to meet her. She seemed very lovely, I was so happy for him.\n\nSince then, John is always inviting her to every friend outing, so I got to know her. We have lots in common, and for John's sake I wanted to be her friend. However, I think that, in the nicest way possible, she is a bit rude. She does art, and half the time John compliments her work shes says \"You hate it, dont you?\". Or times we hang out with other friends we have had to go home early as she was bored, and John was our ride home.\n\nShe hasnt done anything to me personally, but I just dont like her much. Im happy John has found someone he cares for, but having to stand by and watch how she acts sometimes rubs me the wrong way.\n\nHeres where the issue comes in.\n\nYesterday John and I were at the supermarket to do our food shop. Normally, we would buy our food for the week, and maybe a couple of simple/frozen meals to save for Sunday. However, Cat has been coming over for dinners a few times a week and she has a very limited diet. She refuses to eat anything other than fast food or simple/frozen meals. She likely has her reasons for eating specific food, and incase its due to an ED or something similar, I dont want to make things hard for her, or pry into something that isnt my business.\n\nThe time where it becomes an issue for me is how John has now wanted to buy \"back up\" meals for her, incase she doesnt like what we are cooking. This would make sense, as before she has been eating stuff that was part of our weekly meal plan. The problem is John wants me to financially contribute to these extra meals for her.\n\nWhen I spoke to John about this, and said how I am not happy paying half for her meals (our weekly shop cost is just split in half, as we both eat everything) he got quite agitated. He called me selfish for not wanting to help her, just to save money.\n\nI know frozen meals arent the most expensive thing in the world, but John is in a much better financial situation than I am, and while I can pay my share of the bills, and occasionally have outings with friends, I dont want to be dishing out extra money for meals for a girl I have no real connection to, as these small amounts do add up.\nIn my eyes, if Cat doesnt like what we are cooking she could come over a different day, or John could buy back up meals for her out of his own pocket. I feel like an asshole, but I dont think I should be paying for an extra persons food.\n\nIf my bf had a similar situation to Cat, Id see it as my responsibility to provide for him and his diet, and I'd never expect John to pay.\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking this way? Do any of you have any advice?", "created_utc": 1679394869, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xd2g7/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_roommates_gfs/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He can't expect OP to help finance the fact that his GF eats like a child and needs \"back up\" meals.  That is their expense alone and perhaps separate shopping is now in order as you two no longer have the same joint priorities. On the flip side, I also wouldn't continue to rely on John as a ride if you constantly want to stay out with friends later.\n\nIt honestly sounds like your life paths are just splitting at this time and it is best to acknowledge that and adjust expectations of each other accordingly before bitterness sets in.  I'd also get ahead of any rent/living concerns sooner rather than later.  If she's sticking around it may be time to start planning an exit strategy.", "NTA. Your not in the relationship so you shouldn\u2019t have to pay.", "NTA Your roommate is being unreasonable by requesting that you help chip in for paying for his girlfriend's meals. You're not part of their relationship, you're just a friend and roommate of John, not their other girlfriend.\n\nJohn wanting to buy these backup meals, for his gf should be his responsibility, not yours. Simply put. He can call you what he wants, he's still the unreasonable one.  \n\n\n  \nThinking about it shouldn't Cat be paying rent if they're showing up way to often, or at least maybe you should give your landlord a heads up the next time John brings up the idea that you have to pay for Cat's food.", "NTA. These are meals he is buying specifically for his girlfriend, there is no place where it is reasonable for you to pay for them. She is his guest, he is responsible for the costs associated with hosting her", "Personally,  I'd tell John that you're happy to split household bills/groceries etc 50-50 (as you have been, by what you've written) but if he wants to subsidize someone else's food bill, that's totally on him. Not your circus,  not your monkey. NTA", "NTA, but I\u2019d change how you guys do food. When I lived with roommates we each had a shelf in the pantry and fridge and everything there we bought. Occasionally we cooked for/with each other but it was an exception, not the norm.", "NTA - regardless if the girl is rude or not or whatever the reason why you don't like her, she is not your responsibility. She can a) buy her own meals if she doesn't like what you guys eat or b) John can do that for her as he is her boyfriend. Don't think too much, you aren't being selfish, you are just being reasonable!", "It doesn't really matter if you like her or not, you aren't responsible to pay for anyone else's food. NTA", "NTA. You\u2019re not in the relationship, and it\u2019s logical for John to pay for HER girlfriend\u2019s meals outside your weekly meal budget if she wants to eat something else entirely. I\u2019m pretty sure there are items that both of you buy for your own and not to be shared with the other, so that\u2019s in the same vein.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why you had to enumerate the reasons why you don\u2019t like her though. Again, you\u2019re not in the relationship here lol. Good luck!", "NTA.\n\n\nShe can buy her own food. Why would you even consider paying for her? Your friend is an AH for even getting mad.", "NTA and unless the gf is contributing to the budget you shouldn't be covering the extra costs, even if she's wearing the same food as you.  I can understand every once in a while but this is shaping up to her eventually moving in with you still covering 50% to help out \"the poor struggling artist\".\n\nGood luck", "NTA. Who cares whether you like the GF or are supportive of their relationship? That has nothing to do with anything here. John is way out of line expecting you to finance his relationship. Period. That is so over the top it\u2019s really quite crazy. You must be so gaslit by John to think that you need to explain why you don\u2019t want to cost-share his GF. \n\nI\u2019d also take a good look at other areas with John. The entitlement he\u2019s demonstrating, and your uncertainty about something as basic as this, makes me suspect that John is taking advantage of you in other ways too.", "NTA i would foodshop by yourself going forward", "NTA-she\u2019s John\u2019s GF, not a roommate. Items being bought especially for her are John.\u2019s responsibility. Your roommate is just being cheap and you need to tell him that there are not 3 people in this relationship & that you think it\u2019s very honorable for him to help her out, but that there should be clear boundaries so the relationship lines aren\u2019t blurred. \n\nHow you feel about her and your financial situations are not relevant to make this judgement. You could think she was the best person in the world and you\u2019d still be correct not to pay for her. You aren\u2019t the BF. Tell your roommate that he should step up and be a proper BF.", "NTA but its time to shop for yourself and separate your bills and meals until he gets it. This just isnt on.", "You're NTA. The majority of your post about how you feel about Cat is irrelevant. You shouldn't be expected to pay for her meals. As far as any advice goes- two's company, three's a crowd.", "NTA, tell John HE can pay for HIS girlfriend, because does she buy you any food OP?", "You're NTA. She's over for dinner a few times a week. She's his guest. She's having prepared meals (fast food or frozen meals) which cost much more than an extra handful of beans or grain in a pot. You would probably hear a different tune if you said I'll have what gf is having, just bring 3 fast food meals for our dinner. John should stock up on frozen meals at his own expense.  \n\nBut it's probably not worth making a fuss. Their relationship will probably sour quickly, since about 1/2 your post is about her being unlikeable and picky.", "NTA.  No more splitting grocery bills.  And it is probably best to not share cooked food neither.", "NTA.\nHere's a jolly idea...\nCat buys her own food.\nProblem solved.", "NTA. Not your stray, not your problem.", "NTA. I think the solution here is for you and John to start splitting groceries. You pay for your stuff, he pays for him and his gf\u2019s backup meals.", "NTA, he should be surpised you didn't laugh in his face at the suggestion.", "Considering men generally eat more than women, you should not be splitting the cost 50/50 in the first place. he is taking advantage of you.", "NTA. You are not responsible for her food, let alone for her diet . She doesn't pay any rent either . Definitely NTA", "NTA, she\u2019s not your responsibility", "NTA. Cat is his gf, not yours. You are ok splitting the cost of regular meal food even if she eats it. You shouldn't have to pay for her pickines. He should 100 percent foot the bill for his gf.\n\nEta Also find other friends ro hang out with. Or meet then wherever instead of riding with them.

Wow, how cheap can someone be?\n\nNTA", "\"Not wanting to help her, just to save money. \" um yes YOUR MONEY. this isnt your gf. If he wants to buy stuff for her thats on him.  Buy groceries separately.  NTA", "She can also bring over her own food. Since she's so particular,  and doesn't live there", "NTA. Even if she ate the same food as you, you would still have to buy more food, and why should you pay for that either, never mind the frozen meals. If you keep sharing food, it needs to go down to 1/3 to 2/3 split.", "NTA, that\u2019s a weird request from him.", "NTA He should be covering the cost for \"regular\" guests. It's one thing him going to make someone a sandwich who swings by, it's another to be shopping for an extra person.", "NTA overall for the simple fact that she\u2019s not your responsibility. All that other stuff about not liking her choices and what not are a soft AH.", "Hmm well you spend the first half of this post talking about how she's a rude, bad person and you don't like her so I would say that is influencing your decision to not want to split the food bill 50/50.

Here is my suggestion - make a list of the \"common house foods\" - the foods you guys share. Those you buy together and the price of those is what you split. Everything outside that (luxury icecream for you, special treat for him or his gf's backup meals) are paid separately. Obviously you still shop together, but take the bill afterwards and calculate the actual split costs and what each specific person has to pay. \n\nYou should not pay for her meals. She is not your dependent or relation.", "NTA. Cat can buy her own meals if she's visiting", "NTA.  Stop doing joint groceries. Tell John that you will buy your own groceries and he can buy his.  Check your lease and start looking for a different roommate and new place when your current lease runs up. John is the selfish one", "NTA.

Maybe you need to separate grocery shopping. Start doing your own separately from John.", "NTA", "NTA. But you share a food budget with your roommate? Time to stop sharing food.", "NTA. It's literally as simple as \"not your partner, not your expenditure\". If anything, your roommate should be the one paying for her meals, not you. End of problem.", "NTA, this ain\u2019t your girlfriend or kid. He can buy his own kiddie meals for his GF. Who the fuck does he think he is? \n\nStart getting John to pay for your BF\u2019s meals since you\u2019re feeding everyone that comes over.

Why the hell would you ever want to pay for someone elses meals unless you offered?\n\nJohn needs to learn the responsibility of feeding his gf lies on him if thats what he wants.", "NTA, but it sounds though you and John maybe need to sit down and talk about how you adapt to the fact that he's now in a relationship. That could  mean that you don't do a joint show - maybe buy some things (cleaning supplies, basics like bread and milk) jointly but each buy your own stuff other than that. That could be on the basis that you cook together by prior arrangement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's completely reasonable for him to pay for any extras he is buying for his girlfriend, regardless of your and his financial position. Heck, if she is over a lot, it would be reasonable to split the food bill unevenly to start with , if there are 3 people eating on a regular basis.

My brain reversed weeks and months so now my reply don't make much sense. \n\n\nNTA\n\nHonestly, I'm shocked John wants you to pay half for his girlfriend's \"back-up meals\". \n\nBack-up meals is a ridiculous thing to me as well. I have 3 kids ages 13,14,&15. Since they have been old enough to sit at the table with us and eat supper, there has been one rule. You must take a no thank you bite. Because, let's be honest, delicious meals look gross as all hell to a kid. If they really didn't like it, the ONLY back up meal they had was cereal. And then pb&j when they could use a butter knife.\n\nIf gf is as picky as a toddler, she should buy her own damn frozen dinners to pop in the microwave if she chooses. \n\nEven if she don't need a backup meal, she is now eating with you guys how many times a week? Splitting the groceries don't work for me anymore once there's a third person eating regularly.\n\nJohn or better yet the gf needs to be buying anything gf uses/eats that you don't.

Or if they want to eat together more often, have rotating days where one cooks one day, the other the next or something like that.
