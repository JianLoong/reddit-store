John and I have been very good friends for almost 2 years now, after I befriended him at work.\n\n6 months ago he met this girl, Cat (19F). He told me about her the day after he matched with her on a dating app, and took me to her workplace to meet her. She seemed very lovely, I was so happy for him.\n\nSince then, John is always inviting her to every friend outing, so I got to know her. We have lots in common, and for John's sake I wanted to be her friend. However, I think that, in the nicest way possible, she is a bit rude. She does art, and half the time John compliments her work shes says \"You hate it, dont you?\". Or times we hang out with other friends we have had to go home early as she was bored, and John was our ride home.\n\nShe hasnt done anything to me personally, but I just dont like her much. Im happy John has found someone he cares for, but having to stand by and watch how she acts sometimes rubs me the wrong way.\n\nHeres where the issue comes in.\n\nYesterday John and I were at the supermarket to do our food shop. Normally, we would buy our food for the week, and maybe a couple of simple/frozen meals to save for Sunday. However, Cat has been coming over for dinners a few times a week and she has a very limited diet. She refuses to eat anything other than fast food or simple/frozen meals. She likely has her reasons for eating specific food, and incase its due to an ED or something similar, I dont want to make things hard for her, or pry into something that isnt my business.\n\nThe time where it becomes an issue for me is how John has now wanted to buy \"back up\" meals for her, incase she doesnt like what we are cooking. This would make sense, as before she has been eating stuff that was part of our weekly meal plan. The problem is John wants me to financially contribute to these extra meals for her.\n\nWhen I spoke to John about this, and said how I am not happy paying half for her meals (our weekly shop cost is just split in half, as we both eat everything) he got quite agitated. He called me selfish for not wanting to help her, just to save money.\n\nI know frozen meals arent the most expensive thing in the world, but John is in a much better financial situation than I am, and while I can pay my share of the bills, and occasionally have outings with friends, I dont want to be dishing out extra money for meals for a girl I have no real connection to, as these small amounts do add up.\nIn my eyes, if Cat doesnt like what we are cooking she could come over a different day, or John could buy back up meals for her out of his own pocket. I feel like an asshole, but I dont think I should be paying for an extra persons food.\n\nIf my bf had a similar situation to Cat, Id see it as my responsibility to provide for him and his diet, and I'd never expect John to pay.\n\nAm I the asshole for thinking this way? Do any of you have any advice?", "created_utc": 1679394869, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11xd2g7/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_roommates_gfs/", "score": 627, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He can't expect OP to help finance the fact that his GF eats like a child and needs \"back up\" meals.  That is their expense alone and perhaps separate shopping is now in order as you two no longer have the same joint priorities. On the flip side, I also wouldn't continue to rely on John as a ride if you constantly want to stay out with friends later.\n\nIt honestly sounds like your life paths are just splitting at this time and it is best to acknowledge that and adjust expectations of each other accordingly before bitterness sets in.  I'd also get ahead of any rent/living concerns sooner rather than later.  If she's sticking around it may be time to start planning an exit strategy.", "NTA.

Simply put. He can call you what he wants, he's still the unreasonable one.  \n\n\n  \nThinking about it shouldn't Cat be paying rent if they're showing up way to often, or at least maybe you should give your landlord a heads up the next time John brings up the idea that you have to pay for Cat's food.", "NTA.

Who cares whether you like the GF or are supportive of their relationship? That has nothing to do with anything here. John is way out of line expecting you to finance his relationship. Period.

He wants you to help subsidize food costs since he is sleeping with her and doesn't like that he won't be having sex if he doesn't cough up the additional cost. Do you have mutual friends who are aware of the situation?", "NTA\n\nHowever I don't understand why you are paying for ANY of the girlfriend's food - whether it is back up or not.\n\nI shared food expenses with roommates in college as we would eat together Monday through Sunday, \n\nObviously we wouldn't charge people if they had a guest for dinner but if someone were coming over on a regular basis it wouldn't have been fair to the rest of us to pay for the regular guest's food.", "Why can\u2019t Cat buy her own damn frozen meals?? NTA!!", "NTA - Time to do separate food shopping from now on. Of course you can still split common items like condiments, but let him know from now on your food is yours, his food is his. \n\nCould even explain that since new GF has dietary restrictions, this is just better for everyone because you don't have those restrictions and would prefer to eat whatever meals you wish. \n\nI would also be looking for a new place to live.", "If she doesn't like what you're cooking why is she coming over for dinner? This is AITA where we read way too much into stuff because details are often left out... So, are you sure she's not policing the relationship between you and her boyfriend? Maybe him living with a female makes her uncomfortable and she wants to be there even when you're not having anything she can eat just to watch you guys? \n\nThere's got to be a reason she's coming over on nights you're making something she doesn't eat... She and him both have to know by now that she won't eat something you're making! The very fact that he wants to keep backup meals for her, means he's afraid to tell her not to come over because you're making something she won't eat. So why would that be? Would she react negatively?", "NTA\n\nIf John is buying food for his GF, he should be covering the cost.\n\nMight be time to find new housing", "NTA\n\nNot your responsibility to feed his girlfriend. He wants to buy her meals, that's on him.", "NTA But you probably are at a point where you need to have separate finances.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nCat should buy her own extra meals or contribute to the grocery fund.", "NTA isn\u2019t this rule no. 1 of house shares? Leave my food alone.", "NTA. If I invite friends over for a meal I don\u2019t expect my fianc\u00e9 to pay towards the items I purchased for said meal. Same if he is hosting friends, their his friends and it\u2019s not my responsibility to pay for their food.", "NTA", "NTA you need to sit down and talk to John and explain how you feel. It\u2019s not right that you should pay for meals for his girlfriend that you won\u2019t eat. You\u2019ve already worked out meal plans and he\u2019s making changes which is not okay. Set your boundaries now so later there are no misunderstanding and you don\u2019t build up resentment", "NTA Even if she didn't require \"special\" meals John needs to foot more of the costs because she is dining there frequently. Let's say they bought a 13 \u00d79 frozen lasagna and would normally each get a minimum of 2-4 meals out of it if they split it in half. Now, if a girlfriend eats, there is less to split unless they divvy it up prior.\nI think a better solution might be to take turns buying main shared items ( ex:milk, bread,butter, coffee) and buying separately their main courses.", "NTA.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's not your responsibility to feed your flatmate's girlfriend. No further justification needed.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOkay, a very wicked bit of my brain did come up with a way to communicate this:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Well, you two get to have sex, so you feed her. If she and I fuck, I'll buy her a microwave lasagne.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1) Never say this it's terrible.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) See 1)\n\nI couldn't resist thinking it though and y'all needed to know this.", "NTA - she\u2019s his gf not yours.  And if she is over enough to require backup meals you might want to double check your lease to make sure not violating terms.", "You are NTA, but John sure sounds like one. There is absolutely no reason whatsoever that you would ever be responsible to pay for his girlfriend to eat. John needs to keep Cat's meals separate and pay for them after your communal shopping is paid. He's very lucky that you have not given him grief for giving your food to his girlfriend before. Donating to a charity is one thing, but Cat is just a mooch.", "To echo what a lot of people are saying, you're definitely NTA. However, after living with my share of roommates, I'd either, A. continue to split things 50/50, however have himself, or Cat pay for back of meals. B. I would speak to him about keeping groceries separate instead of splitting, and maybe alternating who buys an item that is commonly shared between the two of you, ex: Coffee and Creamer.\n\nHas Cat ever brought her own food, or is she acting like \"I'm a guest, so you must as hosts, cater to my picky eating\"? I feel like my friends with food allergies, or aversions, typically eat prior or post hangout, or they bring their own food so it's not the responsibility of someone else. \n\nEither way, you have no obligation financially provide for your roommate's girlfriend.", "NTA! You\u2019re not here to subsidize their relationship and it was wrong of him for asking you to. HE\u2019S the one in a relationship with her, you are not under ANY obligation to support her in any way let alone financially.", "NTA but you've got the issue twisted. This has nothing to do about money. It's really about commitment. As far as I can see, your roommate is rescuing her in some way and he expects you to do so also. Her diet, her disorganized eating, even her presence in the spath you share with roommate has nothing to do with you. Roommate is treating you like you're both having sex with her in a committed three-way. \n\nTry adopting this interpretation and see how it changes your perspective and response. It might be that you stop splitting food. He should buy and cook his own of he's going to feed her regularly. \n\nYou'd better clarify roles soon. You're going to be paying for her electricity, scrubbing the tub out after her soak and keeping quiet while they have guests.", "Nta. It's not your responsibility to feed roommates gf, you're not the asshole, it's absurd that it's even been presented as such.", "NTA. You are absolutely not responsible for paying for her meals. I would maybe move to buying your own food.", "Nta, they're both entitled. Buy your groceries separately and start looking for a new place asap.", "I think you may need to consider that John isn\u2019t\u2026.the best. Like, 3 years isn\u2019t a big gap but anyone in their 20s choosing to date a teenager always gives me the ick. And he\u2019s pretty happy with her rude ways. And he\u2019s clearly pretty entitled and rude himself. \n\nNTA. Maybe start getting a little distance from John.", "Just start buying groceries for yourself and have your roommate bye his and hers. She\u2019s his girlfriend, it\u2019s not your responsibility to have to feed her.", "NTA. She isn't your gf and you don't have to spend money on her. If she wants to bring things she likes and leave them in the freezer and you said no then I'd think you are wrong but in this case your right.", "NTA. Totally not fair and totally not your responsibility to \u201chelp her out\u201d. It\u2019s actually absurd that he would assume you would cover her food. Next thing you know she\u2019s living there and you\u2019re still paying half and he thinks his \u201chalf\u201d covers them both. Nope. Put your foot down before you\u2019re also paying her utilities too.", "NTA your not dating her you don't pay for her", "NTA.  Even if you liked his gf, you shouldn't be expected to pay for her meals when she is camping at your place RENT FREE.", "NTA, not sure how he thinks you should", "It's time for OP to consider how she's already been feeding John's gf multiple times per week and also take a step back from that. You should probably do separate shopping from now on.", ">I'd also get ahead of any rent/living concerns sooner rather than later. If she's sticking around it may be time to start planning an exit strategy.\\\\\n\nThis is extremely important. The more days she stays over, the more the rent should be split 3 ways instead of 2. If your roommate wants to keep gf there, then he needs to pay 2/3 of the rent.", "Oddly, the relationship is a lot less new than OP living with John. OP has only just moved in. She's spinning this as though the new GF is upsetting the norm, but the GF has been around a lot longer than she has. (That doesn't mean OP should have to pay for the GF, but it makes it a little bit odd that she speaks about how she and John \"normally\" shop when there can't be much of a \"normal\" yet).", "Excellent advice.  \u261d\ufe0f", "*you're", "I've been married over 20 years and my husband and I still do this. Mine is mine and his is his. We eat what we want when we want.  I can't wrap my head around the notion that roommates would pool their groceries. I've never known anyone to do this. Rent and utilities sure but not food.", "What a shitty and frankly extremely strange, take.", "I dont know the exact details of their relationship, but they like having \"date nights\" at least twice in the working week. 9 times out of 10 she will come to our house instead of him going to hers. I always assumed she came over even though she didnt like the food just because she wanted to see him. When shes over I tend to just stay in my room as they use the games console or watch tv in the living room.\n\nMaybe living with me makes her uncomfortable, but Im not too sure. I have a boyfriend and I have absolutely no interest in John, but maybe she still doesnt like it. John is a bit of a pushover though, so it wouldnt surprise me if he didn't want to say no to her. But at the same time, he is very clingy so he may just be wanting to spend lots of time with her, even if it means buying her a backup meal.\n\nAgain alot of this is speculation as I dont know much about their relationship outside of when I just see them hang out together", "YES ! No one talked about this! Before you were contributing 50 50 for meals and weekly grocery for two people, now the GF is there eating weekly. At this point I would start buying my own food and cooking my own food, nothing wrong in this, when I had roommates, we divided the fridge and each bough his veggies and fruits and frozen and whatever, the only thing we shared was spices and oil. Time to step out of this OP.\nNTA", "It may save money in the short term but I can see it leading to many arguments.", "Back when I lived with a few roommates in a large house any shared meal was an individual payment system.  It helped that we lived across the street from a big grocery store, but basically we decided we wanted to cook a meal together that day, went across the street, bought the supplies and split the cost.", "Yeah I don\u2019t think OP is an AH. I do think OP is being wildly naive here. She\u2019s pretty enmeshed with John here and there are just poor boundaries in general. It\u2019s not sustainable."]}
