I had only come to this country for graduation and stayed because I got a good job and a boyfriend. As much as I love being here, in new environment, I never felt comfortable adopting western trends and practices. I was always a bit conservative and my husband had absolutely no problem with it. He was happy swapping out bar hangouts and getting drunk with a quiet night in the house. \n\nI also never had any reason to suspect that he might be unfaithful. Although all his office stories, or at least most of it, revolved around a girl, \"Amy.\" Again, never thought much of it.\n\nYesterday, while he was getting ready for his office, he got a call and it was named \"Workwife \u2665\ufe0f.\" Now that shocked me beyond belief. I'm usually not the one to snoop around but I opened their chat and there were a lot of hearts and nicknames involved. This hurt me a lot and I immediately confronted him about it. He first got defensive and then slowly calmed down as I kept pushing.\n\nHe said and I quote \"Everyone has work wives these days and it's sad that you don't have one (work husband, I assume?).\"\n\nHe had a very condescending tone and again, I got very upset. If I wanted a \"work husband\" I could easily get one. But of course, I don't because I'll consider it a disrespect to my partner. I just kicked him out with his work bag and he didn't come back home for the night.\n\nWhen I told this to my friends (who are natives there), they said that I'm the AH for making a big deal out of nothing. They said it's a common thing to do these days and it doesn't necessarily mean that he is cheating or intends to. After mulling over it, I do feel that's the case. I've tried calling him and texting but he just sent one text that said that he needs space. What do y'all think?", "created_utc": 1698601038, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17j82vk/aita_for_kicking_my_husband_out_when_he_said/", "score": 295, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is not a sexual relationship. It is not commonplace and found more in TV shows and movies.   \n\n\nWhat your husband has is a girlfriend and an affair.", "NTA\n\nBy his reaction, sorry but he probably is cheating on you, maybe not physically yet (it will get there though) but he is certainly emotionally cheating. He needs space because he has been caught in a lie.\n\nTBH if there are no kids to consider, you might want to consider if you want to be married to a liar and a cheat!", "NTA. \n\nI have had a \"work husband\", because our positions at work had us working together as a team on a lot of things and I literally saw him more than anyone else in life. However, he turned into **my REAL husband** \\- so, the term/concept of a work wife/husband is not as innocent as a lot of people try to make it to be. That line gets blurred hella easily and the blurring of said line is only okay if both folks are single and there is not a power dynamic that would make a real relationship inappropriate, professionally and personally. We were both single and after lots of discussion about what a relationship would do to our professional lives, we then became a real couple and eventually married. \n\n**That \"work wife/husband\" stuff was really how we flirted and built up romantic feelings with each other during work hours and kept it professional, in all honesty.** \n\nI will also add: if it was completely innocent and she was just a colleague where there was nothing else going on - you'd be VERY familiar with his \"work wife\", to the point where you'd speak with her often and you wouldn't have discovered her in his phone like that. \n\nAfter marrying my \"work husband\" and him becoming my real husband, the next workplace I was at had me working just as closely with a fellow supervisor, to the point where others would say that man was my \"work husband\" - but, this time, I made it clear that it was inappropriate term because I had a real husband and my real husband was very much acquainted with this supervisor to the point where they had a cordial friendship themselves. There was no secrecy, communication outside of work that my husband didn't know about, and when I stopped working there, I stopped speaking with/communication with that person because he was nothing more than a coworker at that workplace and nothing more.\n\nThere is a lot more going on with your husband and this \"work wife\" and you are not wrong for reacting like this, no matter what he tells you...", "NTA. He's had more going on emotionally than you've known about, not been honest to you, and is now trying to play it down.\n\nWhat difference does it make whether he's had sex with Amy or not? What matters is whether he's devoted to you and and whether you can trust him.", "NTA. I have had work wives. There were no heart emojis in the contacts or the text messages. We were stuck at the hip because of projects. We built platonic friendships while respecting the boundaries of our partners. I have some great lifelong friendships built this way.\n\nHowever, your husband didn't respect your boundaries and flipped the blame on you. He's made himself out to be the victim by making you feel like the abnormal one. You have every right to feel uncomfortable with contact name and text messages.\n\nI wouldn't listen to your friends because the boundaries are yours, not theirs. Your husband married you and your boundaries. If he didn't want to be with someone a bit conservative, he shouldn't have.", "NTA, but this is more an r/relationships sort of issue.\n\nThe workwife/workhusband thing is fairly common, but it is also a fairly common problem in relationships and actual marriages. It's totally fine to have someone at work with whom you can commiserate about the niche annoyances at work, as well as having a trusted confidante for specific work related issues to be a sounding board, especially when that person already knows all the inner workings of the work environment.\n\nHowever, assigning a person a nickname or pet name that is uniquely used by one person starts to mimic a lot of the, for want of better term, intimacy of an actual relationship, especially when the pet name in question (workwife) is a sort of a pseudo-title that you're supposed to hold exclusively: wife.\n\nAdd to it his condescension about your feelings and you've got the makings of a genuine problem in your marriage. TBH, couples counseling may be helpful.", "This sounds dangerously like an emotional affair. I\u2019ve worked with men and been friendly enough to jokingly be called a work wife. Even then, we rarely texted unless it was work related and it was never cutesy. The fact they have nicknames, also known as \u201cpet names\u201d for each other is a bit weird. I dunno girl, be very careful that he isn\u2019t crossing a line with this co-worker. NTA at all he\u2019s downplaying and that makes it even more suspicious.", "NTA.\n\n>\"Everyone has work wives these days and it's sad that you don't have one (work husband, I assume?).\"\n\nUtter nonsense.", "NTA. He is bringing another woman into your relationship and showing her the affection he should be giving you and treating you rudely by justifying his behaviors. I consider this to be cheating and I doubt she's just a workwife based on how much attention he appears to be giving her and how he brings her up constantly. That means she is always on his mind. Good on you for kicking him out and don't let him come back. Your friends are the AH too for supporting his crap.", "NTA. It's a ridiculous term that sexualises a supposedly professional relationship, he wouldn't use it next to a heart if there wasn't a lot more going on.\n\nDon't let him condescend to, manipulate or gaslight you. \n\nYou're still young, you can find a good man who aligns with your values, is respectful to you and your relationship. You're not going to be happy with this man. Don't have a family with him because he will make you a single mother.", "NTA. Work wives is bullshit. What utter nonsense. It\u2019s very simple. If you don\u2019t like his relationship with a woman you discuss it and he stops in order to make you feel more secure. You\u2019re married you come first. He hasn\u2019t done this he\u2019s a massive AH", "NTA. They are being crazy inappropriate and he is gaslighting you", "NTA. Western married man here. This is not normal and not just part of the culture. \n\nAlso, workwife as a nickname is icky. I don't need to give my professional colleagues nicknames like that. It's unprofessional, creates a culture of favoritism, seems to cross a line.", "NTA.\n\nHis reaction to the conversation you were trying to have is very telling. Regardless of whether a \"workwife\" is common or not, it sounds like there were some boundaries that were breached. Would he be as jaded if you were sending hearts and nicknames to a \"workhusband\"? \n\nMy personal understanding of a \"workspouse\" is that while two colleagues may spend a lot of time together at work, there is also respect of the other's real life partner/spouse. I don't see this here.", "NTA- just because it\u2019s a common thing to do now doesn\u2019t mean you have to accept it and be comfortable with it. I would not like it either, he should respect your boundaries.", "NTA, your husband is blatantly cheating (if not physically, but definitely emotionally and that's just as bad)", "NTA. \n\nWhether \u2018work wife\u2019 is a common thing or not is not the issue. Your marriage and your feelings > whatever\u2019s common w/others.\n\nA) You were understandably upset after seeing \u2018wife\u2019 and a \u2764\ufe0f attached to someone else. Your (actual) husband responded with condescension. He dismissed your feelings. That\u2019s a problem. \n\nB) It\u2019s a thin line between having a work spouse and an emotional affair. Which is *at least* as painful as physical cheating. \n\nMaybe he just responded poorly in the moment\u2014or maybe he was gaslighting you. \n\nBut it\u2019s a day later and his reaction doesn\u2019t sound like someone who sees you as an equal partner, with feelings he prioritizes.", "NTA. Workwife with hearts and nicknames and what not is just gross. That level of emotional intimacy would make me pissed too. It\u2019s fine to have close friends at work but that\u2019s overkill and highly suspect", "NTA last work husband I had (granted it was a long time ago and I was young) turned into a boyfriend. He\u2019s at minimum having an emotional affair. Completely inappropriate.", "I am always baffled how these posts where OP is so in the right about being upset, always end up with them ever even posting it because people around them called them an overreacter and they're the A H. \n\nI do not get it. \n\nI would be fuckin furious by all of it. The condescension, the manipulative attitude about EVERYONE having a work wife, because while it can be common, alot of people are very uncomfortablewith it and find it a boundary, and I'd be FURIOUS about my husband sending hearts and nicknames to another woman. That is extremely intimate, and how you speak with someone you either are or want to be intimate with. \n\nThat's thirty thousand different levels of disrespect and manipulation. \nNTA", "NTA! It is not common in the US for wives to acquiesce to their husbands having a 'work wife'. Certainly not one named as such in their phone.\n\nEmotional affairs are still affairs, and I would view this as cheating. If he was contrite and was willing to try to change his work location / get another job, I'd take him back.\n\nThe fact that he wasn't immediately contrite tells me that his affair partner (emotional or sexual) means more to him than you do. Think carefully what you plan to do with the information you have.", "He probably stayed at his work wife\u2019s", "NTA!! Loving nicknames, hearts, saving her name with a heart? Work besties? Absolutely, your work best friend the person who's always there to joke and talk and discuss things, wonderful but he's blatantly gaslighting you and being defensive and condescending are the two main indicators.

He is not respecting your relationship", "nta, that\u2019s sus af", "NTA\n\nI've had a few \"work husbands\"... they were 100% platonic... and if there was anything social, outside of a work sponsored  happy hour, our partners were involved. \n\nNow a days it feels a little icky using that word... but that's probably just me.\n\nYour hubs sounds like an asshat", "NTA\n\nThe whole concept of a work spouse is disrespectful if one of you has a real partner. \n\nI have male friends and we definitely don\u2019t use pet names, and something really bad has to happen for heart emojis to be involved.", "NTA. People are trying to normalize having a \u201cwork wife\u201d but it is weird and creepy and disrespectful. Especially using the heart emoji. You were not wrong to protest this.", "NTA. I can see why you are upset. I think it's completely disrespectful if he has Amy in the phone as workwife even if it's just innocent.  So I think he's  TA for not understanding that.  \n\nAmy could be totally honest platonic friend and that's ok but he could have taken your feelings into consideration before renaming Amy in the phone.", "NTA.\n\nI've had \"work husbands\" at every job I've had. Never have I had them saved in my phone as such, or sent heart emojis or cute nicknames or anything like that because that's not what a work husband / wife is. It's a term you use to call someone that you literally spend every minute of your working day with, you're not actually in a relationship / marriage with them. What your husband is doing is not normal, and if he's not cheating on you already he will be soon enough. I'm sorry.", "He probably stayed with her. The heart emojis aren't common except in relationships.\n\nI wouldn't take him back.\n\nNTA", "I've always thought this was a cringey practice. Someone at an office I worked in labelled a woman my \"work wife\" and I asked for them to stop because it made me uncomfortable. \n\nIt borderline sexualizes platonic relationships. The fact he encourages it would make me feel uncomfortable. But I also would never jump to call it being \"unfaithful\"", "NTA, this isn\u2019t normal, he\u2019s cheating or planning to", "NTA - I\u2019ve been a work wife and have never once had my name as work wife with heart emojis.

Yeah", "That whole work wife, work husband crap is very disrespectful to the actual wife/husband. My wife had a coworker that introduced his self when I met him as her work husband. I corrected him on the spot and had a discussion with my wife when she got home that day.", "Edit: NTA!! \n\nMe (28f) and my husband (28m) have never had a work wife or work husband- we both would find that extremely disrespectful to the other person. \n\nI think your husbands reaction tells you everything you need to know and also him needing \u201cspace\u201d is bullshit, I\u2019d give him all the space he wanted and file for a divorce. Yuck.", "NTA. He is almost certainly cheating on you. I certainly don't text my work friends off the clock, no matter how tied to the hip we are at work. I am certainly not texting them heart emojis and saving them under pet names in my phone. This is abnormal and he is using your unfamiliarity with the country's culture to manipulate you.", "NTA. And it is not common- I've worked in different professions in the U.S. and have never heard of anyone who has a \"work\" husband/wife- I've seen the term here/in popular culture but that's it.  That said, my understanding is that it only implies a relationship with a colleague who you spend a lot of time with AT WORK. The nicknames and emojis are suspect b/c it implies a closer friendship and the fact that he then was dismissive and condescending isn't good.  I think you need to have a productive conversation about boundaries and get some counseling.", "NTA. I bet the doace he is in right now is that of his \"workwife\".", "NTA the term workwife is a new term and one so people can get away with getting too close to work mates and justifying emotional or full blown affairs, you wouldnt think a gym wife or a park wife would be appropriate so why would a work wife be appropriate, it's just a term gaslighters use to get away with being inappropriate", "NTA this isn\u2019t a cultural difference and it\u2019s really weird to me, a born and still living in America, this is not normal and seems like an emotional affair tbh I get why your guilty husband said what he said but I\u2019m so confused by everyone else acting like this is normal", "I had this several times too, and it was never anyhow romantic. I can't even say I was always close friends with them. We just got along well on a day to day basis while the actual focus is work. I like it it's fun having someone like that at work. That's it. No heart emojis, romantic feelings, not even much texting outside work. Your husband is acting weird and suspicious. The fact that he didn't come home and needs space now feels completely off. You're his wife and you should come first. I'm not saying he should have to cut all his work relations but talking this out and compromising so you can feel comfortable should be a given. NTA", "Hi OP,\n\nNTA. \n\nIt sounds like he was trying to gaslight you to get out of trouble. It seems like he's being unfaithful on some level if he's behavior violates what you expect from each other in your marriage. \n\nyour friends are unsupportive and misguided. maybe their partners have tricked them into thinking it's not a big deal to have a work wife so they just don't know any better. \n\na work wife/husband is outdated even if still common. however there should be clear boundaries with that dynamic. I wouldn't want my partner communicating with his work wife too affectionately/intimately or have her contact saved in his phone under \"work wife <3\"! Her name and maybe the company would be fine for ex \"Amy BOA\". \n\nI do think there's better ways you could handle this situation beyond starting off the confrontation heated then throwing him out however he didn't react well at all so I can see why you kicked him out for the night. \n\nBest of luck with everything no matter what happens!", "NTA Where did he stay for the night when you kicked him out? With is 'work' wife? Hopefully you don't have children with this asshole yet so the way should be clear for you to run, girl, run!", "Oh, hell no.

I absolutely see the whole \u201cwork husband/wife\u201d thing as disrespectful,especially when lines are blurred like that, because how they speak on messages is most likely how they also talk in real life .

The term \"work wife\" doesn't necessarily mean anything romantic. It could refer to a 60 year old woman with whom he spends a lot of time at work.

I did not cut off my close work friends though. There\u2019s a difference and everyone knows it, whether they admit it or not.

It's just a work BFF who you share a lot of the same similar professional BS experiences with and it's someone to bitch to about nonsense no one else would understand unless they were dealing with it.\n\nIt's just not an uncommon thing, especially when you are in leadership.  I'm going NAH because I think it's a total misunderstanding.  I think he might feel he needs space because you basically accused him of cheating.", "I have workwife since my wife work with me also \n\nBut I also have work husband since I work with this particular person for the last 10 years \n\nI also have workwife before my wife when I work with this particular person for also 10 years\n\nNTA but delivery could be better", "This is really hard. I have an extremely close (now former) work colleague that we considered each other work husband/wife. We are super close, we tease each other and send lots of hearts and will cuddle when we hang out. There is NOTHING sexual about it, and the most important thing is BOTH OUR SPOUSES ARE COOL WITH IT. We all hang out together and all became close friends. We made sure our partners didn\u2019t feel threatened (luckily that was never an issue) and I was very open with my now husband, then boyfriend/fianc\u00e9 about our relationship. If someone got uncomfortable, we would have respected that. \n\nI\u2019m going to say NTA. There\u2019s a good chance this is a completely innocent work relationship, but the fact it makes you uncomfortable means something needs to change. It\u2019s unfair for the only response to be that you need to get over it and accept it.", "Yea, I think you're being an asshole.\n\nAre you really that insecure about yourself that you would let something like this bother you?\n\nYou really need to grow up, both of you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I had only come to this country for graduation and stayed because I got a good job and a boyfriend. As much as I love being here, in new environment, I never felt comfortable adopting western trends and practices. I was always a bit conservative and my husband had absolutely no problem with it. He was happy swapping out bar hangouts and getting drunk with a quiet night in the house. \n\nI also never had any reason to suspect that he might be unfaithful. Although all his office stories, or at least most of it, revolved around a girl, \"Amy.\" Again, never thought much of it.\n\nYesterday, while he was getting ready for his office, he got a call and it was named \"Workwife \u2665\ufe0f.\" Now that shocked me beyond belief. I'm usually not the one to snoop around but I opened their chat and there were a lot of hearts and nicknames involved. This hurt me a lot and I immediately confronted him about it. He first got defensive and then slowly calmed down as I kept pushing.\n\nHe said and I quote \"Everyone has work wives these days and it's sad that you don't have one (work husband, I assume?).\"\n\nHe had a very condescending tone and again, I got very upset. If I wanted a \"work husband\" I could easily get one. But of course, I don't because I'll consider it a disrespect to my partner. I just kicked him out with his work bag and he didn't come back home for the night.\n\nWhen I told this to my friends (who are natives there), they said that I'm the AH for making a big deal out of nothing. They said it's a common thing to do these days and it doesn't necessarily mean that he is cheating or intends to. After mulling over it, I do feel that's the case. I've tried calling him and texting but he just sent one text that said that he needs space. What do y'all think?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Anything other than \"co-worker/colleague\" and we have a problem. NTA.", "NTA. Because of the heart emojis etc. sounds like major boundary pushing. \n\nWork wife/husband is supposed to be a kind of tongue in cheek joke, that it\u2019s your friend at the office that you spend a lot of time with because of long work hours and close proximity. \n\nThis sounds like it\u2019s moved beyond that.", "NTA.\nBut I\u2019m concerned about the pet name he gives her.", "Your husband is cheating on you. NTA but you\u2019ll be making yourself one if you keep apologizing to someone who is gaslighting you.", " While the concept of a work wife/work husband is accepted. The hearts is beyond. \n\nNTA. \n\nYou have different values and standards.", "NTA. Your husband is being insensitive to your cultural background. Also, his comment telling you that it's sad that you don't have one is a way of invalidating how you feel and turning this around on you. There is no reason he should force you to assimilate to American traditions that go against your own cultural beliefs.", "This isn\u2019t how a work wife / husband works here. She might know how you like your coffee and the names of your kids, and you share office gossip, or cover for each other, but there\u2019s no romantic element and definitely no hearts. It\u2019s just a good office friend.", "No idea if you're the AH or not (probably ESH) but congratulations on turning his \"work wife\" into his real one in the near future.", "NTA The types of messages, the fact he\u2019s named her with a big heart on his phone, and the way he is acting so defensive about it shows that there is more than a platonic connection there. He is gaslighting you into thinking he is behaving appropriately when he isn\u2019t. It\u2019s fine to have close colleagues at work, but the way he\u2019s acting goes beyond simply having a friend at work.", "My long term bf started banging his \u201cwork wife\u201d so that will never be a thing I\u2019ll accept", "NTA. Even if this was innocent (as in, your husband does not actual have or want a sexual or romantic relationship with this woman) as soon as *you* were uncomfortable with it, he should have respected that. Instead he insulted you told you your feelings didn't matter. You are going to have to really talk this out with your husband.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t think the whole \u201cwork husband\u201d and \u201cwork wife\u201d dynamic is that common.  I\u2019ve worked in multiple industries and never heard anyone refer to a coworker that way.  I\u2019ve also never heard any of my friends or family reference a coworker using those terms.  Using heart emojis and pet names indicate their relationship has taken on an emotional element, perhaps even physical.  That\u2019s NOT NORMAL and unprofessional, you have every right to be concerned and feel disrespected.", "NTA \n\nThat was straight up disrespect.", "There was a farmer had a dog\u2026B-I-N-G-O.", "This here \u2b06\ufe0f", "At least an emotional affair if not yet a physical one op . NTA", "Or it could his reaction of needing space is because he felt disrespected his wife kicked him out of his own home.  I would probably want to reconsider a relationship if my spouse believes i can be kicked out at any second", "Emotional affairs can cause just as catastrophic damage as purely lust filled ones\u2026if not more in some cases. He doesn\u2019t have to have sex with another woman to prove he\u2019s not really faithful.", "Why does working closely with someone of the opposite gender make them your work wife or husband? The terminology is just weird and you don\u2019t have to use it, you can just call them friends or something.", "This was very well said. NTA OP.", "My dad had a friend at work my mom called his \u201cwork wife\u201d and it was really just that we\u2019re emotional support for each-other and someone to stick up for the other in a crappy working environment, but boundaries like this were never crossed. He always called her by her name, never called her \u201cwork wife\u201d and never talked to her outside of work (factory though, not much need to have any outside of work contact). I personally don\u2019t like the term work wife, as the only person who\u2019s ever tried that with my partner was also trying to sleep with him and had to be shut down by him (multiple times) coworkers, and eventually me with a \u201che\u2019s told you to stop, it makes him uncomfortable, do you realize you are harassing him?\u201d", "and he didn't come home all night... bet he's with his workwife.", "At a minimum it's an emotional affair, which often turn into physical affairs.", "Truth. I\u2019ve never worked anywhere that was a thing unless the two people were basically engaged in some type of pseudo-flirtation consistently. My husband\u2019s never seen it be a regular thing at any company he\u2019s worked at either.", "That's not even the problem and the fact that he's glossing over the hearts in messages and that stuff and that it's happening in the first place is well.... The real heart of the issue.\n\nSpouse had a work husband. Okay. We took him some treats once. Nice guy, all in good fun and tongue in cheek/joking kind of thing.\n\nSpouse didn't sit and basically text flirt with the guy. I'd have definitely felt differently about the whole thing if he was doing what OP's husband was here.", "100%!!!!", "I have one opposite-sex colleague who is super helpful and great and works in the same space as me almost every workday.\n\nIf I called him my \"work husband,\" I am pretty sure he would respond with \"You have an actual husband, and I am not comfortable with you calling me this way. Please stop. Thank you.\" He has respect, as do I, so I wouldn't do that. Definitely not heart emojis and personal texting.", "Agreed. He didn't ask why this upset her or try to understand why this would upset her. He didn't ask why she's unfamiliar with the term, even though she works somewhere he'd expect it--clearly, it is not the norm everywhere, and he and his friends are minimizing that. If this condescension is new, it needs to be nipped in the bud. If it's something he's been doing, OP has bigger issues, and they need a marriage counselor.\n\nAlso, a day of cooling off is one thing, but it needs to be stated and agreed to that they'll talk later. Maybe he's upset that she kicked him out. Maybe he still needs to learn how to handle his emotions. Maybe it's something worse. There's not enough info to tell.", "Definitely not normal.

Nope.", "Heart emojis next to the name in his contacts paired with acting like that\u2019s normal? A woman with sense and self-respect wouldn\u2019t need to see the conversation to understand how inappropriate the boundaries between the two people are.", "Too lenient. He's a major AH and the gaslighting he followed up with and the refusal to communicate is a clear lack of respect from him.", "It's not just a work spouse but hearts and pet names though.\n\nMy spouse had a work husband, he didn't basically text flirt the guy.\n\nIt sounds more like emotional infidelity than just a work spouse.", "She didn't kick him permanently only to go to work, he didn't come home that night and that speaks volumes.", "Exactly.", "Yeah\n\n\n\nWork friend.\n\n\n\nFriend from work.\n\n\n\nThrowning in a designation strictly used for a romantic partner....wife....or husband....add the nuances of romantic/sexual attraction into the mix.\n\n\n\n\nI think it is disrespectful to all parties in a way because it basically relegates the people involved to being these interchangable tools that serve a purpose to get a job done. Doesn't matter the actual character or personality of a person, a wifeor a husband is just a job. \n\n\n\nBut yeah dude totally wants to or is banging the work wife....pet names and heart emjois is the clue.", "Agreed", "In my experience it usually involves the fact that the \"work spouse\" spends more time with your SO than you do.", "Even so if your partner kicked you out of the house would you feel respected? \n\nYou're only looking at it from OP side. Let's say he's not cheating. I think it's valid he wants some time to see if he wants to stay with someone who looks through his phone starts and argument then kicks him out of his home.", "If this was innocent why would the messages she saw contain lots of hearts and nicknames etc. Sorry this man is up to something he shouldn't be, with someone he shouldn't be doing it with.\n\nI would put money on him being at Work Wife's house when he refused to come home!", "He started an argument with the heart emojis, not her. He married this woman who thinks her boundaries are normal. Sure he can think to change his mind now, but let's not pretend that his wife would even be at fault if he did. Especially as he is sending those heart emojis and pet names, we all know he has his own ulterior motives here.", "I think he crossed a bigger boundary when he tried to downplay it and say you should have a work husband. She's not from a western country and to me it seemed like he just wanted to take advantage and have it his way, when in reality, work spouses can cause a lot of issues in a relationship and it's not a universal norm. It's dismissive and ignores the actual problem."]}
