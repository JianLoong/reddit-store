He criticize and judge almost everyone. \n\nHe tells me I should take care of my partner as women should take care of all of their partners' needs. I don't cook a lot and he was saying I'm a shitty housewife (I have a job and I'm not a stay at home girlfriend). He was snooping around our apartment and when we locked it he was verbally abusive to us. He was going through our trash too, commenting on our food choices. He also talked bad about us to other people. You get the picture. \n\nShit hit the fan because he got sick and couldn't move a lot for a few months. My MIL took care of him and she asked me to help her with cooking etc.  I agreed. I was cooking, cleaning, going grocery shopping for him and he was constantly criticizing me, making innapropriate sexual comments, telling me what should I do with my life, etc. I talked with my partner and he talked to his grandpa numerous of times. He always says I'm lying and that he's a poor man that needs help. \n\nI wasn't at my parents for two months at that time so I decided I'm going away for a weekend. When I left, he called me and said I'm selfish because he needs help (note that my MIL took all of the care over), etc. \n\nI started avoiding him. I'm tired of all the shit that comes from his mouth and of the humiliation that I feel every single day. I tried to avoid him in the past but then he told everyone what a bad person I am, etc. But now I have enough.

You have every right to not lift a single finger for this man again. \n\nAnd tbh your boyfriend is an AH too for letting his grandfather\u2019s behavior continue like this. You should never have been put in this position.", "Why the fuck are you, rather than your boyfriend, cooking and cleaning for this dude?? Tell boyfriend to step it up and either start cleaning or hire a service. At MOST i would do half of the support and I'd make sure that it's the cooking part I can do from my own apartment- let boyfriend be the one to deal with the guy in person. \n\nNTA", "NTA!  I'm glad your BF is supportive but it seems that's not enough to keep you safe from his grandfather's abuse.  Is it possible for you and your BF to move?  If not, just keep avoiding him at all costs.  Maybe overtly video tape him (so he knows you're doing it) when you have to encounter him in person?  Does your BF's mom or sister defend you?  I'm sorry you have to live like this.  Some people are simply awful.", "NTA, seems like an ideal candidate for a care home. Its not fair for you to be abused in your own home. Just ignore whatever he says and in the end, it doesn't matter what he thinks as the world has moved on and he's still left in the dark ages.", "NTA just because he\u2019s sick isn\u2019t an excuse for his abhorrent behavior", "NTA - I'd tell your BF that you are over it and will not stand for it one more minute and that you both need to move elsewhere. If he doesn't want to do it, then you move. A person should not have to go through that, especially if the person has been told to stop it (repeatedly). The other thing I'd do too is to stand up to the old man and call him out on his bullshit. It sounds like no one has done this and just suffers in silence. Your name is already mud with him and whoever he speaks to, so why not send all that hate right back at him?", "NTA. \n\nI\u2019m curious to know if Gramps was always a putz, or if this is new or escalated behavior. \n\nIt sounds a lot like early dementia, to be honest. That can manifest in lewdness and irritability in some. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to subject yourself to that. \n\nIf you like your partner\u2019s mom, I\u2019d focus on caring for her as caregiver.", "NTA... but get away from him ASAP. Your mental health probably starting to go bad, and might get worse with all of this abuse.", "NTA, but what's the deal with this living arrangement? \n\nHow does this man have access to your space if you live in different apartments? Why are you interacting so much with all these people?  \n\nIf this is a multi-generational living space with a lot of cultural expectations then the real solution is probably finding somewhere else to live.", "NTA record the creep when he acts up so you\nhave proof next time", "NTA\n\nWtf is wrong with your partner's grandpa?\n\nIf anything you should have told his grandpa to shut up and that at his age he should have been dead already lol big sack of bones.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And he doesn\u2019t care that you are being verbally abused and sexually harassed?????? Please don\u2019t do this to yourself. Don\u2019t set yourself on fire to keep others warm. Grandpa is an awful person but he is not your responsibility. And please end this relationship and go to therapy. Your partner is condoning this abuse by allow it to happen.

He should be encouraging her not to help anymore and sticking up for her to the rest of the family when the grandpa badmouths her.
