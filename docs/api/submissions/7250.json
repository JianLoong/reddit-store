When did you become a conservative?\" I replied \"Right when I found out that you lost your home, that's when I realized that God and his fury are real\".

I said \"the couch honey, the couch!\". He got upset and said that I was being spiteful for no reason. I said it's an offer either take it or leave it. He ended the call then called back minutes later (he was probably drinking) and kept arguing about how pathetic it was for me to do this and reminded me of how much he's done for me in the past, and said that I can't let him be homeless, then asked if my wife would want that (that shit really got me).
