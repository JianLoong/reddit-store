I mean YELLED. Then she made a big show of giving out prizes to the kids who did wear them. \n\nI\u2019m furious over this for so many reasons:\n\n1. Completely inappropriate to yell at children like that. My kid cried the entire way home because she thought she was going to get kicked out of the dojo. \n\n2. I believe in teaching my children to listen to their own bodies, not what other people say their bodies *should* feel. \n\n3. Most importantly, I\u2019m pissed that she is overriding my authority as the parent. I believe that sets kids up to believe other people - including predators - can override me and tell her what to do. \n\nI talked to some other parents in the class and they think I\u2019m overreacting, that she means well and is actually helping them out in getting their kids to put on a coat without complaining. \n\nWIBTA if I said something?

I also have a cold-tolerant kid.  The problem is the yelling, *for whatever reason.*  That doesn\u2019t work with kids and is not good business practice.

Or \u201cthank you for your concern, but I will put it on when I get cold\u201d etc.  Sounds to me like this woman is lashing out at your kid for other things completely not related to her (maybe she hates her job, maybe she wants to get away from the boyfriend/owner), etc.  it\u2019s a good chance to model polite firmness and boundary-setting with your kid!\n\nI feel for you.
