Then I heard an angry woman and several shrill voices, all arguing, and a woman with a gaggle of children rounded a corner. Four children, the oldest probably no older than 10. One was loudly crying, two were screaming and arguing. The mom said something like 'everyone shut up, we can look in the elevator!' Then she looked up, locked eyes with me & shouted down the hall 'please hold it!'\n\nI didn't WANT to hold it. It was a small elevator & I didn't want to be crammed into it with 5 other people, most of which were screaming or bawling. And as they got closer, I saw that some of the kids looked obviously sick. So I started pressing the door close button over and over. She saw me doing this and yelled for me to stop and started jogging down the hall, but the doors closed before they made it. I went to my appointment feeling a bit bad, but relieved. We're in a pandemic!\n\nOn my way back out to my car, the woman and I saw each other in the parking lot. She screamed at me that I was a fucking bitch for making her life harder than it already is, said I'm a selfish cunt, flipped me off, got in her van and tore out.\n\nI know taking care of four kids alone is hard, but I feel like that was... pretty over the top? Especially because of covid? But I can't help but feel sort of guilty.\n\nEDIT: BC so many people have asked, yes, I and my parents are both immunocompromised. I'm not trying to use covid as an *excuse*, I just don't want to die or kill my parents if I catch it again. I had it last year and it was very serious.\n\nEdit 2: this is exploding. To the ppl who call parents 'breeders' and are being nasty about children in general, especially the person who DM'd me to say the mom should've had four abortions, please go away.
