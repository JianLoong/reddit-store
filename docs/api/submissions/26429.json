It was cruel that they excluded you.  Their comments about alcohol are ridiculous.  It's not hard to keep alcohol away from children at events.  They're making excuses.\n\nIt's fair enough to have a child-free wedding.  It's not only that young children may disrupt the event; it's also about cost.  Including children can mean having to hire a larger (more expensive) venue and providing a lot more food--and catering is expensive.  I have never heard of anyone excluding a close member of the family though!  You were a sibling, not some high school friend's kid.\n\nIt was a big deal that you were excluded, it was inappropriate and weird, and it's understandable that the result is you don't feel close to your siblings.  Let your mother screech.  It's not her wedding.  You don't have to listen to her.  Tell her she has communicated how she feels and the decision has been made.  Then put the phone down or leave the room.

But this:\n\n> they said that the weddings had alcohol so they didn't want any young impressionable kids there. \n\nthat there is pure BS. Almost every wedding I've been to, from when I was a kid until now, has had alcohol (I'm pretty sure only one didn't). It's never been an issue. And, you raise a good point: you could have been invited for the ceremony and alternative arrangements could have been made for the reception. That wasn't entertained. And even so, I'm more worried about the implication that apparently these receptions were such ragers that adults were worried about the mere idea of kids seeing the party. And, honestly, I'd rather have kids at a wedding than a bunch of binge drinking adults who apparently can't be trusted to act decently around kids. \n\nThey didn't want you at their wedding, not even the ceremony, so they don't exactly get to complain when you decide you don't want them at your wedding. Could you be the bigger person and invite them anyways? Sure. But also they're not even sorry about excluding you from an important moment in your family; and I'm sort of hesitant to urge you to be the bigger person if there's no remorse, no attempt to make up for that hurt.", "NTA \nTotally understandable that you dont want them there.

That is pretty painful and I think having them at your wedding would bring up painful memories of exclusion. You fought them on it back then so it\u2019s not like they aren\u2019t aware that you were hurt about it. Exceptions for younger siblings at weddings are normal and expected.

It\u2019s on the couple. But rationally speaking, most kids above say 10 or 13 or at least 15, are old enough to behave and not cause havoc. If you want to talk about exceptions, well those apply to adults as well so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s of much consequence. \n\n\nRegardless, the point remains that after this age, they can 100% invite children. Or at least invite those children closest to them, like their own kids, siblings, nieces- nephews etc. People can cry about their kids not being included, but it should be understood that exceptions are made for close family. \n\n\nI get not inviting kids (OP) super young because they probably won\u2019t even remember or maybe not care as much. But honestly after 10? You can at least expect your own sister to behave. \nEven still, after 15 I don\u2019t see any reasonable excuse for keeping OP out. \n\n\nI don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t invite her, maybe they\u2019re just uppity and didn\u2019t want to make exceptions and didn\u2019t have a relationship with OP so didn\u2019t think much about her or her feelings as such. Maybe it didn\u2019t strike them that she\u2019d feel upset at being excluded (how tf would someone miss that, idk) because they think their decision was rational. \n\n\nEither ways, it feels like they\u2019re only mad at not being invited is because it makes them look bad, like they had an excuse to not invite you saying you\u2019re too young but the same can\u2019t be said for them. They\u2019re simply not invited. \n\nPeople will talk. \nThey\u2019ll figure out you don\u2019t have much of relationship or even connect the dots and see your side. Undoubtedly, they\u2019ll look like bad siblings who exclude their younger sibling. Then people will find more instances to talk about or blow out of proportion. \nUltimately, your siblings and parents will look bad. \n\n\nThey don\u2019t want that, obviously. Image matters a lot to people, often more than the feelings of those around them. \n\n\nDon\u2019t invite them, it\u2019s not your fault that they don\u2019t value you but expect you to value them. \n\n\nIt seems that you don\u2019t have much of relationship with them, maybe because of age and how they exclude you, because if you did have a relationship at any point, they\u2019d listen to you and take your feelings in account and it wouldn\u2019t come to them as a shock that you chose to not invite them to such a momentous occasion in your life. It\u2019s not petty, it\u2019s accurate. You don\u2019t matter to them if they don\u2019t invite you to such an important event of their life, they can\u2019t expect you to not also do the same. \n\n\nNo rational person holds a grudge for this long and take such a big step unless it was due to prolonged mistreatment. So everyone saying it\u2019s petty, it\u2019s not. You don\u2019t have a relationship with them due to their own actions. So don\u2019t invite them.", "100% NTA. It was really shitty of them not to invite you to their weddings. I know people have child free weddings for all kinds of reasons, but a sibling is generally an exception, especially a 12+ sibling. And then on top of that, it is absolutely up to you who you want to invite to your wedding.\n\nThat said, you should definitely think this through very carefully. Your tone comes across as tit-for-tat petty, verging on childish - \"I felt bad for not going to their weddings, so I want them to feel bad too.\" If you don't want them there because you don't have a close relationship with them and you don't care to have one (and quite possibly because they've done other shitty things over the years that have shown you that they're just kind of crummy people), that completely makes sense. But if it's just a petty revenge thing, it's possible that you might regret it at some point down the road.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get child free weddings. They are so wrongheaded. And no exception for your teen sibling? Sheesh. If your relationships are otherwise OK, you might want to invite them anyway, to be the bigger person and not deprive yourself.

Regardless of how they had their wedding you now get to dictate how you have yours.  NTA", "I'm hedging on ESH here.\n\nYes, they should have invited you as a sibling. But you said you understood your two eldest brothers given your age at the time. Your sister, on the other hand, seemed to issue an arbitrary cut-off age, excluding you. But then you said with your final sibling, you \"didn't care\" at that point.\n\nBut your explanation says that you did care, and have cared all this time. You were hurt by what they did. You want them excluded from your wedding because you were excluded. It comes off as petty - that you want them to feel punished for it - and you want to punish them as a group. Is it worth the further rift to your family? What input does your future husband have to offer here?\n\nSome decisions have unforeseen regrets and unintended consequences.", "I can't cast my vote on this matter due to what I believe is a lack of complete context. If your exclusion is solely the reason, then it leans towards \"You're the Asshole\" (YTA), but upon closer examination, it seems there might be more at play, in which case it shifts toward \"Not the Asshole\" (NTA).\n\nI find myself in a unique situation with multiple siblings who are 20+ years older, and our relationship doesn't resemble the typical sibling bond. Often, when I'm around them, I feel like an outsider. They reminisce about shared past experiences, and I lack the connection they have. They feel more like aunts and uncles to me. \n\nDuring my wedding, we invited several people who had caused me, my wife, or other guests pain in the past. We did this to maintain family harmony, and in hindsight, I believe it was the right choice. Some relationships were improved. \n\nSeveral factors to consider here:\n\n1. Have you communicated your hurt over not being invited to them?\n2. What were their reasons for having a child-free wedding initially?\n3. Remember, weddings are not solely about the couple; they're a family event that brings people together.\n4. Think about the long-term impact beyond immediate satisfaction.", "ESH\n\nYour siblings could have included you in the ceremony and not invited you to the reception.\n\nYou're holding onto a grudge from 13 years ago, and it's affecting your relationship. It comes across as petty. Like you're doing it out of spite.", "ESH, I get what your siblings were going for, but you could have very easily attended the ceremony. My (then) 11 year old sister was a junior brides maid in my wedding, and while I did let children at my wedding, She would have been invited anyway if it was childfree, and we have a 14 year age gap. Also, if they let 18 year Olds in, it wasn't abt the alcohol.\n\nThat being said, I cant speak as to how good your relationship with your siblings was, but you were at different developmental times. I would let them come as you are all adults now and the rules change when that happens. Big age gaps are tough. This is one of those tough decisions. If you didn't let them go, I think it would be petty, but it's also your wedding", "You\u2019re NTA for not inviting your brother who didn\u2019t allow you at 18 however you other siblings? Yeah. YTA Why choose your stunt your relationship over pettiness?", "NTA. And WTH? Man, your family is cold.  Child free weddings typically doesn't apply to siblings.  A cousin or nephew is not the same as a sister.

It's your wedding, and you have all the rights to invite who you wish to invite (unless your parents are paying part of it...), but please do be careful how you tread with your family. However, something doesn't feel quite right... because of the age gap, do you have a close relationship with your siblings?\n\nThe first wedding was understandable, but the ones after...? \n\nA 12-year old where I live is a middle-schooler, and if you were very well behaved, I don't see WHY you wouldn't get invited. Hell, at that age, my cousin got her first sip of red wine under the supervision of her parents and us older people. That alcohol excuse is BS. But still understandable, cuz kids at that age and under are unpredictable. \n\n15 years old and above, although still a minor and in high school, I don't see them as \"children\". I believe that most of them are very much capable of making their own decisions and assuming their own responsibilities (aside from major ones), so your sister was full of BS. She equated you to a child below high school age, and she was more concerned about the other children than her own sister.\n\nAnd 17 years old...? Either you were a junior or a senior, and you were close enough to legal age. Adult, but not adult, because of age number and not maturity. Your brother, once again, is more concerned about other children, than his own sister. \n\nMaybe you should ask each and every one of them, where was OP in their weddings and pictures, because clearly OP was excluded.

Biggest disruption was them drinking a bottle of sparkling grape juice and an aunt thinking I was letting them get drunk-nope just hyped up on sugar.  They were giggling and super excited to be at the head table with their uncles and I as well as getting so much attention-my brother was their personal bottle man keeping their glass full.

And many of the young kids stayed and danced in the hall until well past midnight, no one cared they might be exposed to drinking etc, because the point of the wedding is real, genuine unscripted joy and family. I would never want to have or even attend one of these stuffy sounding totally scripted and rehearsed weddings (like, people actually rehearse the wedding?? Like it\u2019s a show or something???). It sounds so contrived and joyless, honestly, like people are prioritizing the look and impression and someone\u2019s \u201cspecial day\u201d all going according to some idealized script rather than actually being a celebration of love and family and real life. And worst of all, it leads to so many situations like this where people exclude family and friends for the point of an aesthetic, causing lasting hurt and damage.

I could be wrong, but I'm in the UK and I've never been to a wedding where children weren't invited.", "Not Western culture, specifically USA culture, where you can own a gun before you can have an alcoholic drink. Most of Europe, including the UK, is totally laid back about alcohol.", "It\u2019s not Western culture, it\u2018s the US. Where I\u2018m from in Germany there are plenty of events, including weddings, where alcohol is served and kids are present. And it would be very weird to exclude kids in the immediate family at the wedding (send them home with a sitter at some point, yes, but not even having your little sister entirely? Not gonna fly.", "Please don't call it Western, I'm from Germany and I've never been to a child free weddings here. I'm not sure if they even exist here.", "Most wedding in the US have alcohol and children. It has been a new trend to make kid free weddings.

It seems like growing up with family that has a good relationship with alcohol and making friends with people who have a good relationship with alcohol is the thing that helps the most, and there\u2019s no remotely fair or healthy way to legislate that.  The people I know who have/had trouble with alcohol either had a close (older) relation with alcohol problems or fell into a crowd where the crowd had issues in their teens or early 20s; I can\u2019t think of any exceptions offhand.", "There's isn't really a relationship to hurt as she said lol", "It's her wedding!!! She can invite or not invite anyone she wants!! \n\nOP NTA", "well i hope you don't have kids and never leave your house. kids and teens are everywhere, their presence might scare you!\n\nand how exactly do teens make it uncomfortable? how are you celebrating if teens cannot see it, it might be your own problem not theirs", "Fine.

Nor do you exclude specific people due to general stereotypes you have of groups of people. You talk to them.", "And their excuse of not wanting impressionable kids at a party with booze doesn't really hold water when the cut off is 16 years old. It seems too convenient that the age limit always excluded OP.", "We can bash the siblings, but I highly doubt OP was the \"well behaved\" child she claims she was, when she's screaming in people's faces at 23. I have a cousin like OP; I was excluded from several family events because we were the same age, and they didn't want ***her*** there to spoil the fun/ take center stage.

I'm just speculating", "NTA but tell your mother she either shuts up about your wedding or she's uninvited too. \n\nSeriously put your foot down.they are all Ah", "Yeah being Eastern European myself I don\u2019t get it. I slept on chairs while the weddings go on an on lol. Alcohol was a normal thing for us. Everyone drinks well before 18. It\u2019s very unusual to exclude children in eastern Europe especially with the \u2018alcohol\u2019 excuse. I have never ever been to a childfree wedding, it\u2019s a family thing. I also never been to a wedding where people would get soooo wildly drunk. By midnight people are drunk but there\u2019s never issues or fights. \n\nIn my area in the Balkans, you arrive at 10am to pick up the bride and you take a SHOT. Very fancy looking specifically decorated bottle and you take a shot first, then you go in. When I was a kid my dad let me lick outside of his glass to not feel excluded. He wanted me to know the taste in front of him, not hide because \u2018everyone else is doing it\u2019. So for us alcohol was never a taboo or a thing we couldn\u2019t do. And for all the people that I know. \n\nYour family forgot one thing, in Eastern Europe not getting invited to the wedding is one of the biggest insults. Have 2 distant uncles that they had a small fight before one the uncles daughters wedding and that uncle didn\u2019t want the other uncles kids or something at the wedding. It\u2019s been 15 years since the wedding they haven\u2019t talked to each other. They are brothers. \nNTA\n\nEdit to add: sadly I am far away from home and my cousin is getting married tomorrow, with around 350 guests, children included. The gossip already has been wild. One of the biggest issues before the wedding is who sits with who at the table cause there\u2019s always uncles and aunts who don\u2019t talk to each other. Good luck organising that lol. Too bad I am not there to show you guys what\u2019s a Eastern European wedding lol.", "Tell your mum that you don't stand for ridiculous tantrums and she is grounded from wedding planning, dress shopping etc", "Yeah im French, and it's customary to have kids around alcohol from a young age. You usually get a sip when you're little and curious, and most kids don't like it and don't ask again lol.\nThe first time I drank wine as an adult I was 24 haha", "Then it makes even less sense. I am from Europe, too, and children seeing adults drink alcohol at family events, New Year's Eve or sometimes wine or a bottle of beer at home for no special reason whatsoever is really normal.", "Same here (German). Kids are a vital part of weddings - you are joining two families, and not just the adults.\n\nAt my own wedding, there were all my cousins. As I am the eldest daughter of a eldest daughter, there was one or two who were 18. Never in my wildest dreams would I exclude my cousins - and especially not my siblings.   \nAnd it is great fun to watch the pictures today of our wedding with them being so young and now all grown up.", "Yeah, I just don't understand it.  We had so many young people in the family that we actually had a children's procession at our wedding.", "Yeah I\u2019m Aussie and the idea of a childfree wedding with no exceptions is weird here. \n\nChildren who are family not getting invited? It would mean war. \n\nMy uncle got married in 1999 and wanted a childfree wedding. Didn\u2019t want to invite any of us nieces and nephews. The youngest at that point was 12. The oldest of the \u2018children\u2019 was 17, I was 16 and two 14 year olds. We\u2019d all been incredibly close with my uncle. It caused a big fight. We all went. (And our parents paid for our meals)", "I'm in the UK and am (reluctantly) attending a child-free wedding this week. \n\nIt feels very barbed. My MIL is getting married. The only children who would be invited are my two. So 'child free' means not having her only two grandchildren there.... weird.", "I\u2019m in the US and it\u2019s still somewhat frowned upon. My cousin had a childfree wedding then was disappointed that only the older relatives attended (her parents\u2019 and grandparents\u2019 generation). The rest of us couldn\u2019t go because we had kids and the only people we trusted to keep our kids (our parents) wanted to go to the wedding. I still sent a gift. I didn\u2019t want a childfree wedding because I had several family members who had just had babies (that I hadn\u2019t seen yet) wouldn\u2019t have been able to attend.", "So I know OP is Eastern European I get that. This is just a random comment on the American thing since I am American. I don't understand not including children in anything that we do here. You end up with adults who don't know how to behave. For example, my husband has only been to a handful of funerals - all my relatives - because as a kid (when most of his relatives died) he wasn't invited to the childfree funerals. As a result he had zero idea how to handle funerals and loss. And now that his parents are in poor health its really an issue. Meanwhile, my family never excluded kids from a single thing. I went to tons of funerals and weddings. And I have to say, given a recent funeral I attended, I'm pretty well adjusted to how to behave. And weddings are exactly the same. If kids don't go they have no idea how to handle it as adults. This childfree thing that a lot of Americans do is BS.", "It's rare but it does happen I'm from the UK, and a couple years ago, my cousin was getting married, and his mother-in-law didn't like kids, so it became a child-free wedding, but the big kicker was that the mother didn't like kids yet she was a teacher.", "> I think child-free weddings are mainly a US thing?\n\nThey aren't common here in the US, but seem to be gaining in popularity.", "\u201cbut i didn\u2019t cut them off\u201d. Well, it is never too late.", "Do you all have the same two parents or are you half siblings? I just wonder if the bad relationship might be a result of that, like they don't see you as a sibling the same way they see each other.", "She asked, I answered. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth destroying a relationship over pettiness but they don\u2019t seem to have one so there\u2019s no point", "Yea, I ain't no abusers, so I certainly won't have bio kids.\n\nNever said it scares me, but i certainly can't celebrate properly with them around, asking dumb questions, making dumb comments and generally everyone having to hold their tongues around them so you don't get annoyed by offended parents later.", "Yeah, just that OPs reasoning is that they are mad and vindictive, whilst her siblings where looking out for their guests.", "Nice projecting exercise there, mate.", "If your cousin didn't invite you to their wedding or something like that, would you show up at their house and yell at them? Be relieved? Or just quietly accept it.\n\nBased on the story OP screamed at 16, not great but understandable.\n\nIf OP was a pest, then siblings should be quietly happy they don't have to deal with the wedding. Or, use to OP being a pest and not making a big deal of it.", "I'm from the US, and it can vary. Some churches did away with wine and use grape juice; some use Dixie cups so people aren't sharing a cup. But the churches I've been to, you take the bread, then the wine, they have a cloth they use to wipe the rim between people.", "You are. And you're wrong. Have you ever been to catholic mass? Actually been to one? Full communion IS watered down wine and bread. You take a SIP... and whatever is left in the chalice after every member has received communion, the priest finishes himself; the only one possibly getting a little tipsy at mass is the priest.", "Pretty sure the wine is always watered down", "I am Greek too. Maybe the difference is, in general, the adults in Greece don't use the wedding as an excuse to get  trashed with alcohol? plus, we don't demonise alcohol as much to legalise consuming it at 21.", "Back ages ago, when I got married, weddings were a family affair too, with kids, grandma's and grandpa's--everyone (in the U.S.).", "Acceptable to have a \"no kids after 9\" rule or something, but just a whole wedding with no children is very weird to me.", "I do find that weird, and also it makes it harder for parents to attend of course.", "You're not obligated to attend if you don't want.", "There is no relationship. Being excluded by all 4 of your siblings will put paid to that.", "Then why would they expect that this grown kids will have any bond with them? It was their choice and now its their consequences. Id get it when OP was ten. But 15 and 17, cmon. All my 15yo nieces and nephews are drinking occasionally (we are in europe, so nothing weird). And when u exclude adult child you should understand how it might bite you in the a$$. And OPs mom is completely delusional by grounding kid for wanting to be part of the family celebration", "I think I'd rather have a teenager asking dumb questions at a wedding than a joyless boor.", "Ohhhhh, I get it now. You're a 15 year old edgelord troll who's still mad that they had to babysit a younger sibling a few years ago.\n\nGot it.", "They didn't have to let her go to the reception. Just the ceremony. Most kids over the age of 6 can behave themselves for that long. Them still cutting her out in her teens is just spiteful. Them dismissing her when she tried to tell them how hurt she was made it even worse. Frankly, I think they had this coming off the back of that alone. They wouldn't hear her as a child, now they have to listen to her as an adult.", "I gotta say, having a screaming fit when she was 15 doesn\u2019t exactly give off \u201cI\u2019m mature enough to attend the wedding\u201d vibes. I mean I get that her understandable frustration was boiling over, but it probably just made that sibling think they made the right call in excluding her.", "Oooh, wow, that's really different! Is your \"bread\" also actually bread? We have these weird things called \"host is\" (idk how to spell it). \n\nThey're hard to describe. Idk if you ever had edible paper candy, but they're like that (except without the sweetness).", "Good point, I also think Greek parents expect their kids to behave and represent the family and them respectfully. Nothing worse than disappointing your Greek parents and the guilt trips you have to deal with, especially mom guilt \ud83d\ude2c. Getting drunk at a family wedding isn\u2019t worth the trouble. And being the topic of family gossip no thanks", "Yeah exactly. Or \u2018my friends kids aren\u2019t invited\u2019 isn\u2019t unusual. But I\u2019d be stunned to go to a wedding with zero children.", "Exactly. In my family/social circles this is how it goes. With common sense, not with hard rules.

When my husband and I are both teachers. It's a morning wedding with an afternoon meal. \n\nIt also means I can't use childcare as an excuse to just send my husband, because we have our regularly scheduled care. I'm just missing the party to have the evening with them.", "I said the same exact thing in my comment, what point are you trying to make to me?", "The point is that it's a lot harder to be joyful around them, for one because you can't speak freely due to annoying whining breeders", "I think we can cut her some slack as a clearly unsupported kid dealing with adult siblings that didn't want her at their major milestones. We should not hold her to an adult standard for reacting to exclusion from family.", "Yes, we have the \"holy host\" wafers.
