It was cruel that they excluded you.  Their comments about alcohol are ridiculous.  It's not hard to keep alcohol away from children at events.  They're making excuses.\n\nIt's fair enough to have a child-free wedding.  It's not only that young children may disrupt the event; it's also about cost.  Including children can mean having to hire a larger (more expensive) venue and providing a lot more food--and catering is expensive.  I have never heard of anyone excluding a close member of the family though!  You were a sibling, not some high school friend's kid.\n\nIt was a big deal that you were excluded, it was inappropriate and weird, and it's understandable that the result is you don't feel close to your siblings.  Let your mother screech.  It's not her wedding.  You don't have to listen to her.  Tell her she has communicated how she feels and the decision has been made.  Then put the phone down or leave the room.

I love your energy \u2026.it\u2019s a no siblings over 33 rule  !!", "NTA seems pretty cut and dry to me, they didn't invite you  and don't invite them, they brought that upon themselves,and making the cut-off 16 and not Inviting you at 15 was just a dick move \n\nHope you have a Wonderful Wedding", "NTA - your wedding. You get to decide the guestlist. They didn\u2019t care about your feelings when they planned theirs so it\u2019s alright that you only worry about yours when you plan your own.

If it\u2019s out of spite, it could come back to bite you if you regret it later.", "NTA. What they did was exceedingly cruel. To not invite one sibling out of many. Just you.

They didn't want you at their weddings, also include their funerals.", "NTA, petty, but I\u2019d do the same.", "NTA, and I call bullshit on the reason they gave (alcohol).

Turnabout is fair play.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, the idea of a child-free wedding has always been weird to me. But this:\n\n> they said that the weddings had alcohol so they didn't want any young impressionable kids there. \n\nthat there is pure BS. Almost every wedding I've been to, from when I was a kid until now, has had alcohol (I'm pretty sure only one didn't). It's never been an issue. And, you raise a good point: you could have been invited for the ceremony and alternative arrangements could have been made for the reception. That wasn't entertained. And even so, I'm more worried about the implication that apparently these receptions were such ragers that adults were worried about the mere idea of kids seeing the party. And, honestly, I'd rather have kids at a wedding than a bunch of binge drinking adults who apparently can't be trusted to act decently around kids. \n\nThey didn't want you at their wedding, not even the ceremony, so they don't exactly get to complain when you decide you don't want them at your wedding. Could you be the bigger person and invite them anyways? Sure. But also they're not even sorry about excluding you from an important moment in your family; and I'm sort of hesitant to urge you to be the bigger person if there's no remorse, no attempt to make up for that hurt.", "NTA \nTotally understandable that you dont want them there. You might have been young, but they shuld have included you in the sermony itself and sendt the \"children\" home when the party started. Its your wedding and totally up to you who to share the day with.", "Seems perfectly fair to me. NTA", "NTA. That is pretty painful and I think having them at your wedding would bring up painful memories of exclusion. You fought them on it back then so it\u2019s not like they aren\u2019t aware that you were hurt about it. Exceptions for younger siblings at weddings are normal and expected.

It\u2019s on the couple. But rationally speaking, most kids above say 10 or 13 or at least 15, are old enough to behave and not cause havoc. If you want to talk about exceptions, well those apply to adults as well so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s of much consequence. \n\n\nRegardless, the point remains that after this age, they can 100% invite children. Or at least invite those children closest to them, like their own kids, siblings, nieces- nephews etc. People can cry about their kids not being included, but it should be understood that exceptions are made for close family. \n\n\nI get not inviting kids (OP) super young because they probably won\u2019t even remember or maybe not care as much. But honestly after 10? You can at least expect your own sister to behave. \nEven still, after 15 I don\u2019t see any reasonable excuse for keeping OP out. \n\n\nI don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t invite her, maybe they\u2019re just uppity and didn\u2019t want to make exceptions and didn\u2019t have a relationship with OP so didn\u2019t think much about her or her feelings as such. Maybe it didn\u2019t strike them that she\u2019d feel upset at being excluded (how tf would someone miss that, idk) because they think their decision was rational. \n\n\nEither ways, it feels like they\u2019re only mad at not being invited is because it makes them look bad, like they had an excuse to not invite you saying you\u2019re too young but the same can\u2019t be said for them. They\u2019re simply not invited. \n\nPeople will talk. \nThey\u2019ll figure out you don\u2019t have much of relationship or even connect the dots and see your side. Undoubtedly, they\u2019ll look like bad siblings who exclude their younger sibling. Then people will find more instances to talk about or blow out of proportion. \nUltimately, your siblings and parents will look bad. \n\n\nThey don\u2019t want that, obviously. Image matters a lot to people, often more than the feelings of those around them. \n\n\nDon\u2019t invite them, it\u2019s not your fault that they don\u2019t value you but expect you to value them. \n\n\nIt seems that you don\u2019t have much of relationship with them, maybe because of age and how they exclude you, because if you did have a relationship at any point, they\u2019d listen to you and take your feelings in account and it wouldn\u2019t come to them as a shock that you chose to not invite them to such a momentous occasion in your life. It\u2019s not petty, it\u2019s accurate. You don\u2019t matter to them if they don\u2019t invite you to such an important event of their life, they can\u2019t expect you to not also do the same. \n\n\nNo rational person holds a grudge for this long and take such a big step unless it was due to prolonged mistreatment. So everyone saying it\u2019s petty, it\u2019s not. You don\u2019t have a relationship with them due to their own actions. So don\u2019t invite them.", "100% NTA. It was really shitty of them not to invite you to their weddings. I know people have child free weddings for all kinds of reasons, but a sibling is generally an exception, especially a 12+ sibling. And then on top of that, it is absolutely up to you who you want to invite to your wedding.\n\nThat said, you should definitely think this through very carefully. Your tone comes across as tit-for-tat petty, verging on childish - \"I felt bad for not going to their weddings, so I want them to feel bad too.\" If you don't want them there because you don't have a close relationship with them and you don't care to have one (and quite possibly because they've done other shitty things over the years that have shown you that they're just kind of crummy people), that completely makes sense. But if it's just a petty revenge thing, it's possible that you might regret it at some point down the road.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get child free weddings. They are so wrongheaded.

But then you said with your final sibling, you \"didn't care\" at that point.\n\nBut your explanation says that you did care, and have cared all this time. You were hurt by what they did. You want them excluded from your wedding because you were excluded. It comes off as petty - that you want them to feel punished for it - and you want to punish them as a group.

My (then) 11 year old sister was a junior brides maid in my wedding, and while I did let children at my wedding, She would have been invited anyway if it was childfree, and we have a 14 year age gap. Also, if they let 18 year Olds in, it wasn't abt the alcohol.\n\nThat being said, I cant speak as to how good your relationship with your siblings was, but you were at different developmental times. I would let them come as you are all adults now and the rules change when that happens. Big age gaps are tough. This is one of those tough decisions.

Hell, at that age, my cousin got her first sip of red wine under the supervision of her parents and us older people. That alcohol excuse is BS. But still understandable, cuz kids at that age and under are unpredictable. \n\n15 years old and above, although still a minor and in high school, I don't see them as \"children\". I believe that most of them are very much capable of making their own decisions and assuming their own responsibilities (aside from major ones), so your sister was full of BS. She equated you to a child below high school age, and she was more concerned about the other children than her own sister.\n\nAnd 17 years old...? Either you were a junior or a senior, and you were close enough to legal age. Adult, but not adult, because of age number and not maturity. Your brother, once again, is more concerned about other children, than his own sister. \n\nMaybe you should ask each and every one of them, where was OP in their weddings and pictures, because clearly OP was excluded.

And many of the young kids stayed and danced in the hall until well past midnight, no one cared they might be exposed to drinking etc, because the point of the wedding is real, genuine unscripted joy and family. I would never want to have or even attend one of these stuffy sounding totally scripted and rehearsed weddings (like, people actually rehearse the wedding?? Like it\u2019s a show or something???). It sounds so contrived and joyless, honestly, like people are prioritizing the look and impression and someone\u2019s \u201cspecial day\u201d all going according to some idealized script rather than actually being a celebration of love and family and real life. And worst of all, it leads to so many situations like this where people exclude family and friends for the point of an aesthetic, causing lasting hurt and damage.

I still get half embarred when I think back to that wine tasting event and remembering my heavily drunk uncle acting like a 5yo trying to run from his wife around their car because he didn't want to give her the keys.\n\nIt turned out that was *the best way* to learn to not get drunk like that. That it should be savoured, not binged. And now I like a glass or shot every once in a while, but I can easily go months without the stuff.", "OP never said they were American. 18 is old enough buy alcohol in the rest of the world, and the minimum age for consuming it in many countries is lower than the age for buying it.", "I'm British, and I *have* attended at least two childfree weddings here in the UK, and I've known about a few more. \n\nI understand why people wish it - children can get into a lot of dangerous stuff, even if it's just running across the road, and sometimes adults want to celebrate and not have to worry every few minutes about what the children are doing or whom they might be with.

Even a 10 year old should be well behaved with to be included in a limited role honestly and you were a sibling! Do your siblings have a reason to resent you?

Because of the age difference, your children will be excluded from their childrens' weddings. You were excluded and your children will be as well.\n\nYour family taught you the art of exclusion. You've perfected it.", "NTA. The first two weddings I can slightly understand if they did not want a minor who is not a teen yet in their wedding. At 15, you already expressed how hurt you are for being excluded from the wedding and yet they disregarded your feelings. At 17, when you lost interest in attending the wedding your parents were still angry? How very entitled they are to be at your wedding. I say let the parents be uninvited to the wedding also.

Now that is a new level of low and gross/disgusting behavior I have ever heard of when it comes to child free weddings. \n\nA lot of weddings have alcohol and still have children go to them, it isn't hard to just have them both.

I remember my friend and her husband not eating at all because they stuffed EVERYTHING into that 30ish minute meal time - dances, cake cutting, bouquet toss, etc. They didn't want him to feel he missed out. There was a guest list of something like 300 people, and all but one family understood that OF COURSE, the groom's son would be the exception to it being child-free.
