It was cruel that they excluded you.  Their comments about alcohol are ridiculous.  It's not hard to keep alcohol away from children at events.  They're making excuses.\n\nIt's fair enough to have a child-free wedding.  It's not only that young children may disrupt the event; it's also about cost.  Including children can mean having to hire a larger (more expensive) venue and providing a lot more food--and catering is expensive.  I have never heard of anyone excluding a close member of the family though!  You were a sibling, not some high school friend's kid.\n\nIt was a big deal that you were excluded, it was inappropriate and weird, and it's understandable that the result is you don't feel close to your siblings.  Let your mother screech.  It's not her wedding.  You don't have to listen to her.  Tell her she has communicated how she feels and the decision has been made.  Then put the phone down or leave the room.

Turnabout is fair play.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, the idea of a child-free wedding has always been weird to me. But this:\n\n> they said that the weddings had alcohol so they didn't want any young impressionable kids there. \n\nthat there is pure BS. Almost every wedding I've been to, from when I was a kid until now, has had alcohol (I'm pretty sure only one didn't). It's never been an issue. And, you raise a good point: you could have been invited for the ceremony and alternative arrangements could have been made for the reception. That wasn't entertained. And even so, I'm more worried about the implication that apparently these receptions were such ragers that adults were worried about the mere idea of kids seeing the party. And, honestly, I'd rather have kids at a wedding than a bunch of binge drinking adults who apparently can't be trusted to act decently around kids. \n\nThey didn't want you at their wedding, not even the ceremony, so they don't exactly get to complain when you decide you don't want them at your wedding. Could you be the bigger person and invite them anyways? Sure. But also they're not even sorry about excluding you from an important moment in your family; and I'm sort of hesitant to urge you to be the bigger person if there's no remorse, no attempt to make up for that hurt.", "NTA \nTotally understandable that you dont want them there. You might have been young, but they shuld have included you in the sermony itself and sendt the \"children\" home when the party started.

That is pretty painful and I think having them at your wedding would bring up painful memories of exclusion. You fought them on it back then so it\u2019s not like they aren\u2019t aware that you were hurt about it. Exceptions for younger siblings at weddings are normal and expected.

It\u2019s on the couple. But rationally speaking, most kids above say 10 or 13 or at least 15, are old enough to behave and not cause havoc. If you want to talk about exceptions, well those apply to adults as well so I don\u2019t think it\u2019s of much consequence. \n\n\nRegardless, the point remains that after this age, they can 100% invite children. Or at least invite those children closest to them, like their own kids, siblings, nieces- nephews etc. People can cry about their kids not being included, but it should be understood that exceptions are made for close family. \n\n\nI get not inviting kids (OP) super young because they probably won\u2019t even remember or maybe not care as much. But honestly after 10? You can at least expect your own sister to behave. \nEven still, after 15 I don\u2019t see any reasonable excuse for keeping OP out. \n\n\nI don\u2019t know why they didn\u2019t invite her, maybe they\u2019re just uppity and didn\u2019t want to make exceptions and didn\u2019t have a relationship with OP so didn\u2019t think much about her or her feelings as such. Maybe it didn\u2019t strike them that she\u2019d feel upset at being excluded (how tf would someone miss that, idk) because they think their decision was rational. \n\n\nEither ways, it feels like they\u2019re only mad at not being invited is because it makes them look bad, like they had an excuse to not invite you saying you\u2019re too young but the same can\u2019t be said for them. They\u2019re simply not invited. \n\nPeople will talk. \nThey\u2019ll figure out you don\u2019t have much of relationship or even connect the dots and see your side. Undoubtedly, they\u2019ll look like bad siblings who exclude their younger sibling. Then people will find more instances to talk about or blow out of proportion. \nUltimately, your siblings and parents will look bad. \n\n\nThey don\u2019t want that, obviously. Image matters a lot to people, often more than the feelings of those around them. \n\n\nDon\u2019t invite them, it\u2019s not your fault that they don\u2019t value you but expect you to value them. \n\n\nIt seems that you don\u2019t have much of relationship with them, maybe because of age and how they exclude you, because if you did have a relationship at any point, they\u2019d listen to you and take your feelings in account and it wouldn\u2019t come to them as a shock that you chose to not invite them to such a momentous occasion in your life. It\u2019s not petty, it\u2019s accurate. You don\u2019t matter to them if they don\u2019t invite you to such an important event of their life, they can\u2019t expect you to not also do the same. \n\n\nNo rational person holds a grudge for this long and take such a big step unless it was due to prolonged mistreatment. So everyone saying it\u2019s petty, it\u2019s not. You don\u2019t have a relationship with them due to their own actions. So don\u2019t invite them.", "100% NTA. It was really shitty of them not to invite you to their weddings. I know people have child free weddings for all kinds of reasons, but a sibling is generally an exception, especially a 12+ sibling. And then on top of that, it is absolutely up to you who you want to invite to your wedding.\n\nThat said, you should definitely think this through very carefully. Your tone comes across as tit-for-tat petty, verging on childish - \"I felt bad for not going to their weddings, so I want them to feel bad too.\" If you don't want them there because you don't have a close relationship with them and you don't care to have one (and quite possibly because they've done other shitty things over the years that have shown you that they're just kind of crummy people), that completely makes sense. But if it's just a petty revenge thing, it's possible that you might regret it at some point down the road.", "NTA. I don\u2019t get child free weddings. They are so wrongheaded. And no exception for your teen sibling? Sheesh. If your relationships are otherwise OK, you might want to invite them anyway, to be the bigger person and not deprive yourself. If the relationships are bad or so-so, don\u2019t invite them.", "You're not the asshole for not inviting your siblings to your wedding. It seems you're hurt by their past decisions not to invite you to their weddings, and you want them to experience the same feeling. Your reasons are understandable, and it's your wedding day, so you have the right to decide who you want to invite. However, it might be worth considering whether this decision could lead to further strain in your family relationships. Ultimately, it's your choice, and you should do what feels right for you.", "This are the consequences to their actions.  Regardless of how they had their wedding you now get to dictate how you have yours.  NTA", "I'm hedging on ESH here.\n\nYes, they should have invited you as a sibling. But you said you understood your two eldest brothers given your age at the time. Your sister, on the other hand, seemed to issue an arbitrary cut-off age, excluding you. But then you said with your final sibling, you \"didn't care\" at that point.\n\nBut your explanation says that you did care, and have cared all this time. You were hurt by what they did. You want them excluded from your wedding because you were excluded. It comes off as petty - that you want them to feel punished for it - and you want to punish them as a group. Is it worth the further rift to your family? What input does your future husband have to offer here?\n\nSome decisions have unforeseen regrets and unintended consequences.", "I can't cast my vote on this matter due to what I believe is a lack of complete context. If your exclusion is solely the reason, then it leans towards \"You're the Asshole\" (YTA), but upon closer examination, it seems there might be more at play, in which case it shifts toward \"Not the Asshole\" (NTA).\n\nI find myself in a unique situation with multiple siblings who are 20+ years older, and our relationship doesn't resemble the typical sibling bond. Often, when I'm around them, I feel like an outsider. They reminisce about shared past experiences, and I lack the connection they have. They feel more like aunts and uncles to me. \n\nDuring my wedding, we invited several people who had caused me, my wife, or other guests pain in the past. We did this to maintain family harmony, and in hindsight, I believe it was the right choice. Some relationships were improved. \n\nSeveral factors to consider here:\n\n1. Have you communicated your hurt over not being invited to them?\n2. What were their reasons for having a child-free wedding initially?\n3. Remember, weddings are not solely about the couple; they're a family event that brings people together.\n4. Think about the long-term impact beyond immediate satisfaction.", "ESH\n\nYour siblings could have included you in the ceremony and not invited you to the reception.\n\nYou're holding onto a grudge from 13 years ago, and it's affecting your relationship.

My (then) 11 year old sister was a junior brides maid in my wedding, and while I did let children at my wedding, She would have been invited anyway if it was childfree, and we have a 14 year age gap. Also, if they let 18 year Olds in, it wasn't abt the alcohol.\n\nThat being said, I cant speak as to how good your relationship with your siblings was, but you were at different developmental times. I would let them come as you are all adults now and the rules change when that happens. Big age gaps are tough. This is one of those tough decisions. If you didn't let them go, I think it would be petty, but it's also your wedding", "You\u2019re NTA for not inviting your brother who didn\u2019t allow you at 18 however you other siblings? Yeah. YTA Why choose your stunt your relationship over pettiness?", "NTA. And WTH? Man, your family is cold.  Child free weddings typically doesn't apply to siblings.  A cousin or nephew is not the same as a sister.

It's your wedding, and you have all the rights to invite who you wish to invite (unless your parents are paying part of it...), but please do be careful how you tread with your family. However, something doesn't feel quite right... because of the age gap, do you have a close relationship with your siblings?\n\nThe first wedding was understandable, but the ones after...? \n\nA 12-year old where I live is a middle-schooler, and if you were very well behaved, I don't see WHY you wouldn't get invited. Hell, at that age, my cousin got her first sip of red wine under the supervision of her parents and us older people. That alcohol excuse is BS. But still understandable, cuz kids at that age and under are unpredictable. \n\n15 years old and above, although still a minor and in high school, I don't see them as \"children\". I believe that most of them are very much capable of making their own decisions and assuming their own responsibilities (aside from major ones), so your sister was full of BS. She equated you to a child below high school age, and she was more concerned about the other children than her own sister.\n\nAnd 17 years old...? Either you were a junior or a senior, and you were close enough to legal age. Adult, but not adult, because of age number and not maturity. Your brother, once again, is more concerned about other children, than his own sister. \n\nMaybe you should ask each and every one of them, where was OP in their weddings and pictures, because clearly OP was excluded. If OP's not there, it's all fair game if the siblings aren't there either.", "Nope.  NTA.  Child free weddings aren't some iron clad context and people often make exceptions for close family.

Give the children some soda and they'll be plenty happy. \n\nBut then again we all also have the fear of the apocalypse happening once we get home if we should misbehave during a wedding banquet so adults didn't usually have to deal with misbehaving children either.", "Thank you for correcting me. My comment stands.", "lmao Americuh the land where you can buy a gun at 18 but need to be 21 for alcohol.", "17 and 18 is the same difference. He should\u2019ve invited you. But if you don\u2019t have a relationship then why make the deciding factor of whether or not you invite them based on the fact they didn\u2019t invite you to theirs? You don\u2019t have a relationship so there\u2019s no reason for them to go", "And originally sister didn\u2019t mind children in the event, but was talked around by others to use 16 as cutting point. Like they are not even trying to hide it", "oh no, we are eastern European, we all know about alcohol and kids do get a taste when they are young. that's why i didn't get the alcohol exuse", "Because in Chinese culture they value the family unit. Some households have 3 or 4 generations under one roof. They are not quick to kick their children out at 18. Chinese weddings are great because the brides wear so many outfits. \n\nIt brings joy to have their entire family their. OP\u2019s family clearly did it to exclude them. They them it\u2019s a asshole free wedding. Explain how alcohol could make them bigger assholes. If mom keeps complaint tell her not to come. Lol she wants her whole family there now.", "were were never close, but i didn't cut them off. we still sometimes talked and met at the family gatherings.", "Okay yea that makes even less sense. definitely NTA", "NTA I\u2019m Greek and it\u2019s the same for my culture. Weddings are a family event. It\u2019a not just about the bride and groom. I have never been to a Greek child free wedding. OP sounds like everyone in her immediate family including her parents are AH. IMO she should have a family free wedding. Focus on her future leaves these awful people behind", "I seen My Big Fat Greek Wedding and I know these are my kind of people. Opa!", "Lol yeah a lot of people think that movie was an exaggeration, not so much lol. And it\u2019s interesting how similar a lot of cultures can be, especially when it comes to family."]}
