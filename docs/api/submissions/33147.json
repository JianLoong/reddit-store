Recently, my family hosted a holiday party with relatives and friends. I don\u2019t live at my parents\u2019 anymore and live quite a ways away so I was definitely trying to take in all of the changes to my childhood home. I finally reach my room and come to find that my younger brother 17m had taken over my old room without asking. He is deaf so this interaction is in ASL( America sign language).I proceed to give him a hard time by guilting him and teasing him about it but this was all in good fun. I wasn\u2019t actually mad at bro cuz he had to share his room with our younger brother 14m and I was actually happy for him for getting his own space. He gave me a tour and everything and I found that he utilized the space better than I did lol.\n\n            Later on in the party, this fact gets brought up again and I jokingly pretend to be mad at the fact that my room was taken over. I said something to the effect of \u201c that asshole wants to be me so bad\u201d referring to my brother. I said this orally and also signed it in ASL. My brother responds by saying \u201cI bring more bitches in there so we\u2019re not the same\u201d in ASL. I respond by telling him to shut the fuck up in ASL and verbally because he really got me with his response. Again this was simply BROTHERLY BANTER and there was no ill will between either of us. \n\n            Towards the end of the night my dad\u2019s sister, we\u2019ll call her aunt Ursula(54f), pulls me aside and starts chewing me out. She\u2019s pissed that I called my brother an asshole and to shut up. I tell her it\u2019s all in good fun and we talk like that all the time because we are close. She tells me that I\u2019m disrespectful to deaf people for calling my deaf brother an asshole. And she kept infantilizing my brother saying that deaf people need our respect and I should be nice to my brother because he\u2019s shy and soft spoken which is why she thinks he wouldn\u2019t confront me about cursing at him.  I think this is hilarious because my brother is nothing of the sort and she would know that he\u2019s funny, charismatic and a little perverted if she LEARNED ASL. She refuses to learn asl because it\u2019s \u201ctoo hard\u201d and doesn\u2019t face my brother properly when she yaps so he struggles to lip read what she\u2019s saying.  I tell her this almost verbatim and explain that I\u2019ll treat my deaf brother the same as my other siblings. \n\n               I\u2019ve heard through the grapevine that she\u2019s calling me ableist now to anyone who will listen. My brother thinks it\u2019s hilarious because she didn\u2019t understand his comment about bring bitches to his room and wonders if she\u2019d cuss him out for his foul hands lol. \n\n\nI feel kinda disturbed that I\u2019m being characterized as a bad person though and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m wrong here. \n\nBtw: swearing is not really taboo in my family!

Your treat him as your beloved little brother, joke with him in a way that is enjoyed by both of you, and speak to him in the language he is more comfortable in.

Only what you said, and she thinks you shouldn't be cursing at your brother because he's deaf? I agree she's infantalizing him.\n\nNow, should you have cursed in front of your relatives. I don't know how casual your family is about language, but that might not be something to do in front of Ursula again. \n\nI'm glad you have such a good bond with your brother and it's shitty AF that some of his relatives won't learn ASL to communicate with him.

It sounds like you have a perfectly healthy sibling relationship at your ages, keep on rocking and to hell with the others.", "So funny the ableist calling you one. You\u2019re an asshole, sure, but you\u2019re NTA. You and your brother have a pretty common relationship, and she doesn\u2019t get it, and she won\u2019t.", "NTA. Don't participate. Don't react. Don't comment. Just let it go and eventually it will evaporate.", "NTA. Your aunt is getting offended on your brother's behalf. The only person who can say your words were hurtful is your brother - he doesn't care you called him an asshole, so you didn't do anything wrong. \n\nIf you want your aunt to stop bothering you, you can tell her you asked your brother directly if your behavior bothered him.
