A 5F, 3M, 2M and 1M. My husband has been hell bent on taking our daughter out of our resident state of New York to his parents in Arkansas. I am wholeheartedly against the idea and have conveyed that repeatedly.. my husband says I\u2019m being selfish by not letting him take our daughter to his parents. I have let him and her travel to various other states but do not feel comfortable with her going to my in laws and have put my foot down and said no. \n\nSome context\u2026 My mother in law is just awful. She despises me. Has said she wished her son married someone else. Accidentally texted the family group chat talking shit about me when it was just meant to go to her other son and/or daughter. Insinuated that i was having an affair with her husband- my FIL. (Because i went exceedingly out of my way to help him get medical care for his Alzheimer\u2019s). repeatedly crossed boundaries i have set for our children. (No posting them on social media, No mouth kissing, no sharing food or drinks when you have a COLD SORE!) my mother in law is not nice to any of my children. Having been at my home for 2 weeks just 3 months ago, not once did she hold either of my youngest children and repeatedly told my oldest \u201cleave me alone\u201d. Not to mention my mother in law is a depressing individual who talks about death of her loved ones repeatedly. As she held my first born baby for the very first time she started sobbing and talked about how she had a stillborn that looked like my baby. Lastly, this woman drinks 1.5 bottles of wine a night alone. Every. Single. Night.\n\nMy father in law is amazing. He used to be very loving to our children and would spend the entire summer with us before his illness took over. Now he is non verbal and short tempered. He spanked our 3 year old during their last visit to our house. (We are a non spanking household) i grabbed my kids and took them all into another room. obviously my kid isn\u2019t traumatized but it made me extremely uncomfortable and i felt i could keep my eyes off all of my kids when he was around. My husband told me to let it go since his dad doesn\u2019t really understand much at this point.\n\nWhile my boundaries are repeatedly crossed. my husband doesn\u2019t necessarily agree. He is much more relaxed and lets many things slide. \n\nNeedless to say, i don\u2019t feel comfortable having my 5 year old daughter in their home for many reasons\u2026 I\u2019ve told my husband he\u2019s welcome to go visit them alone but i don\u2019t want our daughter going with him. He says the visit isn\u2019t centered around his parents. That he wants to go to show her where he grew up. To which i responded, if that\u2019s the case then we can all go as a family and you can show all of us. He said no.

My parents have their issues. Everyone has negative aspects. But denying your husband the right to visit his home and see his parents with their child over the petty stuff this lady wrote is wrong. You all can\u2019t seem to get past the framing of what she wrote to get to the meat of it. Her MIL doesn\u2019t like her. That\u2019s the meat of it", "I didn\u2019t say she made it up. I\u2019m saying her reasons with MIL are petty and she\u2019s being spiteful", "Im quite confident that I\u2019m smarter than you. You keep talking about toxic behavior, but the only toxic behavior I see is between OP and MIL. That\u2019s a personal issue and I don\u2019t think you take this kind of action involving children over petty dislikes.", "Who said it only happen once? Who wanted to share food and drinks while having it. Does that sound like it was in the best interest of the children?", "That is but its at night time so they dont have to stay with them and leave beforehand. As long as its only at night.", "Found the mother-in-law! \u261d\ufe0f", "She drinks that much every night.  Therefore, we can extrapolate that she\u2019s drink whilst watching the children.  Quit trying to rationalize your behavior.  (Yes, I\u2019m convinced you\u2019re the MIL.)", "MIL has shown she isn't safe to be around her grandkids and OP is protecting them. If they can't get along with OP and MIL both there, then they need to repair that relationship prior to bringing the kids arouns. If MIL respected boundaries, it wouldn't be an issue. But she has shown to not respect boundaries. You can't fault OP for protecting her kids. \n\nI have boundaries in place with my in laws. And finally we are in a great place. But when my FIL repeatedly ignored our boundaries and put my kids at risk (premature baby getting kissed on the lips  after repeatedly reminding not to along with many other things), we went low contact with him. He has slowly rebuilt our trust over years, but my kids aren't around him without is there. My first priority is to keep my kids safe. End of story.", "It's not petty to not want others to kiss and share their germs with children. You're so wrong about this.", "\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude44 ok you\u2019re right. We should make laws removing parental rights to anyone who\u2019s had a cold sore. This dangerous issue should be all over the news", "I\u2019m convinced you guys have poor critical thinking skills.", "I don\u2019t think this is about the kids safety. Her gripes seem to be around her relationship with the mother. Seems pretty clear to me", "Having a cold sore isnt the problem. Is not wanting to take precautions not to spread it. \n\nIf someone knowingly had herpes should they not avoid spreading it to others?"]}
