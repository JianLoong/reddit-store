You got there early to get some food in you before your shift, not to start working early. It would have been a generous thing to do, but definitely not expected of you.

Your shift hadn't started yet so why would you clock in?", "NTA she should have cleared this with you before if she wanted you to reciprocate the favor.", "NTA, you don't need to clock in early, because the managers probably only want to pay you for the agreed hours anyway. But it is obviously irritating your coworkers to see you sitting around waiting to be served when they're busy and you're about to start work anyway, so maybe eat at home before your shift and take advantage of your discount at the end of your shift.", "YTA if she specifically clocked in early allowing you to leave early, this kind of work relationship is important to being a cohesive team.
