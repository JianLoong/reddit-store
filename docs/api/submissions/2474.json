If he had damaged a car , would they have the same attitude?\n\nWhy did your mother give a 13yo boy your laptop? what did she think he was going to do on it??  read a book? and all in your bedroom????\n\nIt sounds like your mother is 50% responsible for this mess. \n\nThe whole 'boys will be boys' excuse has to be stabbed in the heart.", ">They thought the whole situation was really funny and told me that Keith is just being a boy\n\nCool, follow their lead. Go to their house, destroy something that's worth the equivalent of your laptop, then when they're upset and demand you to pay for it just tell them you're being a \"clumsy girl\".\n\nNTA and they owe you that laptop!

It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that the child downloading porn from a porn site is the most likely source of the virus. And where does the negligence come from lol.

Especially when we're talking a $1,500 machine.", "Honestly you are absolutely not the AH, you are doing the right thing, but there is something else from my perspective that we shouldn't forget - your mom is also at fault for just giving it out to him without supervision and your permission. At this point you might demand one part from her and one part from them so it's even. She probably did not ask you if it's okay to use it so she needs to face the concequences of her own actions UNLESS she actually called you and asked you about it. And as for the little boy, he needs to face his own too - firstly because within the content he watched, he brought you viruses and that he physically broke your laptop - sure, all kids do want to know about stuff like this but incognito mode exists for a reason and he must have been more careful. Imagine he does that to somebody else or to you again... He needs to learn his lesson too, because his parents probably spoil him too much and if he doesn't see where this goes, nobody will learn. I'm sure you will get some kind of satisfaction if you confront the kid about this and tell him that it's not okay. If the parents don't get it, make the child take some kind of responsibility - he is grown enough and he knew exactly what he was doing. That would be very helpful for him in the future\n Something you may take as precaution is to put an antivirus now so mistakes like this never happen. \nMy point - everybody needs to get what they deserve. Maybe because the parents of the kid are this much petty, they need to take the biggest part of it, but that doesn't automatically eliminate the other people's faults. It shouldn't be a \"one takes for all\" situation.\nThat's my view from the information I'm seeing in front of me so there might be details that I don't really know. \nI really do hope the absolute best for you Honestly! I feel you and it's a total bummer that you even have to go through this! Let us know if there is any update.", "NTA\nUncle should pay the bill, but there is no way that you need a new laptop. A virus is a program, a wipe and reformat will clean the HDD. If it's a hardcore virus and touched the bios, you can restart it, but there is no way that you need to change it for that. My suspicion is that the tech was trying to sell you a new one, or a complete different problem.\nEdit: now that you have learned, inform your parents about this new policy of my stuff it's not for lending and locked door", "NTA but I agree this is your mother's problem, not your uncles.

You're blaming it on the wrong people, if your mother allowed a kid to use your stuff, that's on her, the kids parents are assholes for going along with it, the computer repair shop guy just sounds lazy because I really doubt a virus just killed your computer as a whole, a reformat or a new ssd should fix it.", "NTA, but I would start with your mom. Your mom can deal with aunt and uncle if she wants them to give her money.\n\nYour mom is the one who chose to give the kid your laptop to use - a laptop that wasn't hers to make that decision about. Your mom is the one who insists on knowing your password and then chose to give the kid access to your laptop (either entering the password or giving it to the kid to use). She is responsible to you for making you whole for the damage that she allowed to happen to your property.\n\nYou should also inform your paternal grandparents about what your mom allowed to happen to the expensive gift they gave you. You are a kid; it is appropriate for you to seek some adult reinforcements to deal with an adult in a position of power and authority over you. (I don't generally recommend adults get other adults to help fight their battles.) Where does your dad stand in all this? Doesn't he care that your mom allowed an expensive gift from his parents to you to be damaged?\n\nIf your mom wants to deal with the aunt and uncle about how their child damaged property that she allowed him to use, it's up to her to pursue money from them. Note: If they refuse to pay her, she may learn to not be so free with your property or even her own when that kid comes over again.", "NTA and I would tell them to cough up the money or they can cough it up in court.", "Replace a whole laptop because of a virus? Total BS. It is possible the shop you took it to did a reset instead of a full wipe and reload. Resets don't get rid of all viruses. The viruses usually are able to corrupt the files to reset, so there a pieces of it left. \n\nTo fully get rid of it, the drive must be wiped and the OS reinstalled from the laptop recovery media. If it did not come with it, an OS disk or drive can be used to reinstall. The drivers would be available on the manufacturer website. Scan any backup drives you have as well. They could have corrupt files. \n\nI am a Lead Repair Tech\n\nStill NTA.
