Reverted to a previous state or a full wipe/restore.

An OS that has been infected once is not to be trusted again.

Include the repair bills in the small claims.\n\nAlso, there are viruses you can't get rid of when you download them. Most virus protection stops them from downloading themselves, but if you choose to download them they get into the system files, which means, even you reformat your computer, the virus is buried in the files used for reformatting.
