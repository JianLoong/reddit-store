So you get to keep whatever income you have left over after paying the mortgage and all living expenses, and she keeps all her earnings? Does she work full-time? Is what you have remaining approximately equal to her earnings (so you both have the same amount to spend any way you want)? Does she only spend her money on herself, or does she buy things for the family/household? Did she contribute anything to the down payment??? <- Edit: Just reread and noticed you said she contributed nothing to the mortgage.\n\nI know some if these questions are just different iterations of the same question (LOL), but I\u2019m just trying to clarify in my mind bc it sounds more and more like that\u2019s an EXTREMELY fair arrangement.", "She works full time.  Probably makes 70-80k per year after taxes, which she spends however she wants.  If she does buy gifts and toys for our daughter but 99% of household things are from my income.\n\nAfter expenses, I contribute to retirement funds for us and an education plan.

It\u2019s blatantly clear that IN NO WAY are you the AH here. \n\nIt\u2019s a shame she ruined the mood on a happy day, but you really did everything right by clearing it with her first (including telling her the cost). She has her own discretionary income, so she shouldn\u2019t be dictating how you spend yours. After all, it doesn\u2019t sound like the household is worse off because of this one gift. And it was a really thoughtful gift. To your PARENTS. I\u2019m guessing that if, prior to this, she wanted to do something really meaningful for her parents, you would kick in if she didn\u2019t have quite enough. I don\u2019t blame you for not feeling that way now. I wouldn\u2019t either, and not because I\u2019d want to take it out on her parents, but because I wouldn\u2019t want to help HER.
