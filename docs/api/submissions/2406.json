The Band, my wife introduced to me, and it is now my favorite band. She takes pride in that and wants us to experience the concert together, (she also loves them a lot). Here's the problem, my wife is 36 weeks pregnant, she doesn't and probably cant go to the concert because of the loud music, overcrowding, etc. When I say I still want to go, she is furious, and frequently cries about it (she is pregnant, so I understand the crying). I can't help but feel as if she is being selfish, and just because she can't enjoy the concert, doesn't mean I can't as well. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Ok this blew up. I just want to add further information. First of all, I see everyone getting upset at me, I understand, but please take into consideration, this is the reason I came to this subreddit, not because I feel as if I'm in the right, I am asking because I wanted to seek the opinions of others. I tried to sell the tickets, but no one has bought them. I put them up for sale 2 weeks ago, and the tickets totaled to $600. I asked all of our friends, and they are busy, so I didn't want them to go to waste. I said we planned it for a long time, that is the case. Since its her first pregnancy, she didn't know how she would feel, and now she isn't comfortable going. I also want to add we planned this with a group of friends, not just us. I didn't feel the need to add this information because personally I didn't think it would blow up. For those of you who are asking This band is very niche and hasn't toured in years, especially since COVID. She isn't worried about pre-term labor, just upset that I would go without her.

Admittedly it\u2019s not our favourite band and I won\u2019t be quite as far along as 36 weeks, but its standing room only and I\u2019m 99% confident I won\u2019t want to go.\n\nSo I told him to take a friend and go and enjoy the evening.

And you\u2019re going to loose money either way. No one is gonna pay the full value of the tickets, and if you went by yourself then the other ticket won\u2019t be used anyway. You have to get to a concert at least an hour early for parking, and when it\u2019s over it can take 30-60 minutes to get out of the lot. If it wasn\u2019t her favorite band, then I could see you going if you had a good plan in case something happened. \n\nBut I think it\u2019s not the actual concert she\u2019s upset about. She\u2019s upset because she wants you to stay home in solidarity with her. I think your wife just wants your emotional support that night because it\u2019s her favorite band too. It might not be rational, but she\u2019s got a soup of hormones going on that she can\u2019t do anything about. You both made a baby, she didn\u2019t get pregnant by herself. She\u2019s sacrificing her body, and you\u2019re sacrificing missing your favorite band. That\u2019s what happens when you become parents. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is TA really, it\u2019s just the circumstances of life right now.", "INFO: This situation confuses me. Did you buy the tickets before your wife was pregnant? You said you were planning this for \"a long time\" so you both knew she'd be 36 weeks pregnant at the time of the concert. What did you discuss about these plans? Also, what do you mean by \"probably can't?\" does your wife plan to go, or not, or only if she doesn't feel well? Have you discussed staying near the back and missing the openers, and if that would be calm enough for her to attend?\n\nI think the most key information for me here is this: Is this a band that tours/performs regularly? If so, have you considered waiting a year or two and seeing them with her next time they come around?", "INFO: Will this be the first time you're seeing them in concert? Has your wife seen them in concert yet? Will there be future chances to see them in concert?", "YTA. Your wife is more important than a concert. Put her first and sell the tickets to someone else. And buy her some flowers as an apology.", "You know what, I'm gonna go against the grain here and say NAH. I can sympathize with your wife as I'm 8 months along, but I wouldn't stop my spouse from going to a concert that's pre-paid especially if he couldn't sell the tickets. It's her first pregnancy so she's probably extra emotional which happens, just sit down with her and try once more for a calm civil conversation. Lay out all the facts and make sure she knows if something happens, you'll leave the concert immediately and go home to her which means probably no drinking for you", "Is it selfish of her to want you not to attend the concert because she can't? Kinda! Is this a time to insist on selflessness from a person who has been carrying your future child for nine months and about to undergo a physically and mentally exhausting ordeal on your family's behalf? Hint: do you think she got pregnant for the sheer unadulterated hell of it?\n\nNOPE!\n\nYTA. Don't be a dick and make your wife feel bad. Sell the tickets and stay home with her. Make a night of it  with her favorite takeout and listening to your favorite albums together.", "YTA.\n\nBe serious. How do you think she feels knowing that you're going to go to a concert that she would enjoy, but can't go?\n\nBesides, this late in the pregnancy, she definitely needs your support and assistance. What if something goes wrong while you're at the concert? At this point, I would be putting all activities that place you out of reach on hiatus.", "How pregnant will she be the day of the concert? Is it safe for her to be left alone? Is there a chance she might go into labour? When you asked her why she was furious what did she say?", "NAH. As a woman who goes to tons of concerts (some while pregnant!) there is nothing wrong with going by yourself. She's got understandable FOMO, but it's pretty selfish to expect you to miss out on this experience because she is choosing not to go. That being said, you probably can't relate to it understand the truly would emotions and thoughts a pregnant person has, so decide how important this is to you, this might be a hill you die on.", "NTA.. go to the concert and have a good time. Me and my wife are in a similar boat. There is a concert coming up in about 8 months. We both wanted to go but for me the price was too high to consider going. My wife was fine spending that amount I wasn\u2019t. I fine with staying home even though he was on my bucket list to see before he dies.", "Metal chick here who went to concerts pregnant.   Unless it's a drive from a hospital she can totally go.  Just not to close to speakers", "Man I'd be furious if my bestie went to a show without me to our favorite band and we were living together. \n\nI can't imagine if one of us was pregnant. \n\nYTA. Rub some salt into the wound why don't you?", "Unpopular opinion.  Nta. As a woman who has had 3 kids, go to the concert. Enjoy yourself.  Wife is being selfish.  Why waste the tickets? I personally like have 1 day or evening by myself to relax.", "NTA. So you're supposed to just eat the money and spend every moment with your wife until she gives birth? I don't see what the issue is as long as you can be reached and the concert isn't very far away,", "I\u2019m going with NTA. Why waste the tickets? She\u2019s being selfish.", "Your wife\\`s 36 weeks pregnant, be a nice person, stay at home. She needs you. YTA", "Have either of you been to their concerts before?  \n\n\nI guess my thing would be...even if you think she's being irrational is this really a hill you wanna die on? Making your very pregnant wife that upset this close to giving birth? Do I think she's a bit over the top being \"furious\"? Yeah, personally, but still I'd suck it up and not go until she could go. YTA", "NTA. You\u2019re not attached at the hip. This is such a stupid petty reason to be upset with you. If you were sick would you expect her to stay home from going out with friends or to a concert because you couldn\u2019t go, I sure hope not. She can suck it up and either go and stand in the back or sit in a seat where ever the non crowded place is, there is always non crowded places because that\u2019s where people do not want to be and you can stand with her or she can stay home and be upset.\n\nWanting someone else to pass up a good time because you can\u2019t or won\u2019t do it is so annoying self centred.", "She's sacrificing her entire body and mental health to grow your child. She can't drink, eat certain foods, or even sit comfortably. How have you contributed to the growth of this baby...\n\nYou haven't. How about you make a small sacrifice and stay home. YTA", "NTA, I will be in the minority but I don't understand why most people here think that the universe revolves around someone who is pregnant, it would be wrong for you to go if you are close to the birth of your child, I would go to the show as you said it would be if first concert and your wife can go with you in the future and one night is no big deal", "YTA. Leaving her at home would not be cool on your part at all. She introduced you to the band and can't go because she's carrying your child. Try harder bro lol. Sorry I know it sucks and probably stings a little but the sacrifice is necessary. Don't be mean.", "YTA Dude, don't go to that concert. YTA", "NTA and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get downvoted but I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s can\u2019t just say go have fun and enjoy with the group of friends that are going. When I was hugely pregnant, I encouraged my husband to go do things and didn\u2019t hold him back at all. This is a weird thing for her to be upset about. It\u2019s your first time seeing the band you love so she should understand your excitement. She\u2019s being childish.", "YTA. Being so far into her pregnancy is difficult enough for her as is, and to go to the concert while she misses out on going with you only adds fuel to the fire. This is a time you need to be there for your wife - maybe she needs you now more than ever. Skipping out on this concert for your wife, who is carrying *your child*, is a worthwhile sacrifice here. You can always book another concert in the future so she can experience it with you.", "So I understand at that point that her going to a concert could be hard on her. Did you try and say well wear headphones that are noise canceling wear a mask etc. and be able to go with you? How would you feel if she went into labor and you\u2019re at the concert and she has the kid and you\u2019re not there?\n\nYou have to do what\u2019s right for you and your family. I guess go without her but she probably will never go to a concert with you again. And be prepared for the silent treatment. But do what you wanna do I guess", "This is a hard one.  I feel like she\u2019s frustrated with your level of attention towards her over other things besides just this issue, otherwise she\u2019d probably let you go and just have a girls night in with friends while you\u2019re gone.  Additionally, you could show more understanding and trade favors toward her (either right away or after the baby comes), which she would appreciate (there are probably lots of opportunities here)", "Since when can't pregnant people go to concerts? Genuinely confused by this take.", "NTA for wanting to go. And I don't think that she should be mad that you're having fun without her. But, this far along in the pregnancy, she could go into labor pretty much any time. So unfortunately I don't think that you get to go. I think she's an asshole if she's mad at you for wanting to have fun without her. But she's not an asshole if she wants you to be there in case she goes into labor. Those are two totally different things. People who are bitter about others having fun without them suck. But people who miss out on their wives labors also suck more. \n\nLike if I have a medical problem and I can't go to a concert, I would be thrilled if my friends got to have fun and go without me. And if a friend with a medical problem got mad at me for going to a concert without them, I would not like them.  Better someone to go then nobody gets to go. But, this is different because her labor requires your assistance.", "NTA. Just because she can\u2019t go why shouldn\u2019t you? You\u2019re going out for a few hours, not out of town. Next time they are in town you can go together, or she can go out with her friends and you stay home with the baby.", "NAH. I get her being upset, but I also understand wanting to see this band you\u2019re so invested in. Doesn\u2019t make either of you an AH in my book. \n\nStill, if you\u2019re smart, don\u2019t go.", "YTA. Your wife (and life partner) can't go because she's busy growing your child inside her body. That's a huge task and it's making huge, life-altering changes to her body.\n\nAnd here you are putting a good time ahead of supporting her in this huge undertaking. And expecting her to suck it up about being left home alone to grow your child while you go party. \n\nA better partner would give up the concert just for the sake of solidarity and being supportive.", "NTA. Seeing your edit, the tickets would go to waste if you don't go. However, you should continue to do your best to sell them. Also this is NOT the hill you want to die on. Make sure that your wife is (and knows that she is) your priority. Remember that the reason why she doesn't want to to go, is because she thinks it is something special between you two. If you go, you just might ruin that.", "INFO:\n\nIs her issue that she's scared of being alone while that pregnant (premature labor, etc) or is she just upset about FOMO?", "NTA. You were supposed to go together and SHE's the one that isn't able to go", "NTA, plain and simple. You're allowed to enjoy things without being made to feel like a jerk about it.", "Your wife is sacrificing her literal body to grow a baby, I think you can skip a concert for her.

From the kid whose own mother had tickets to a concert at 34 weeks and went into labor the same day. She missed the concert and I'm pretty sure she didn't forgive my premature self.

This is something that ya'll planned to do together and now that she can't, you are gonna go anyway. \n\nThat baby can show up AT ANY POINT from here on out.  If you're at the concert, you're not near her. You're out there doing something loud that you two enjoyed together while she's home feeling awful (there is a whole baby in her body taking her vitamins and minerals and energy and sometimes kicking her from the inside out) and you \"don't want to waste\" concert tickets.", "NTA - Personally I think being upset others are enjoying things when you can't, to whatever reason is normal but still your own problem. Pregnancy sucks imo, but she's still her own person and hopefully capable of enjoying an evening relaxing alone, even if you're doing something she'd like to do herself. You tried to sell or give away the tickets, which puts this in NTA territory for me. That said this is your relationship, you know better than any of us if she will be able to get over this or if it's going to cause long term problems, which no concert is worth imo.\n\nIs there a compromise here somehow? Could you go to the concert with your friends and have a pampering/spa day with your partner beforehand?", "YTA - you do realize that the reason she's pregnant is because of you, yeah?  The fact that she is having both of yours child should be enough to put ANYTHING on hold!  Especially this late in the pregnancy.  Who the fuck cares how niche the band is.  This is your wife and soon to be born child.  I really hope that you are a better father than you are a husband (or ex-husband at this point)", "YTA.  You never ditch your pregnant wife.

These are two separate things.\n\nNo, I don't see them as two separate things.\n\nThis band is meaningful for both of them. She's the one who introduced him to the band. I would fully understand about how a concert would be more meaningful if they saw it together. And knowing how much this means to her, I would call him an asshole for wanting to go without her.\n\nAnd any man who's forgotten an anniversary or a birthday will tell you that OP is treading on dangerous ground. Think it's petty? Go ahead and think that. But the fact is, it's important to her and that should be enough to discourage him from going without her. And in his place, I really don't think I'd want to go without her.

We saw them 'together' in different states a few weeks apart from one another. Was fantastic. I even pushed him to get a ticket for himself!

The first is that she's upset that he gets to go without her. The second is that she might go into labor. The first would make her an asshole. The second makes perfect sense and trumps the first by a lot. But if there wasn't somebody about to go into labor, and she just couldn't go to the concert for another medical reason, and was mad at him for going? She would be the asshole. Being miffed that other people are having fun without you makes you an asshole every time, especially if you simply cannot go for medical reasons.
