The Band, my wife introduced to me, and it is now my favorite band. She takes pride in that and wants us to experience the concert together, (she also loves them a lot). Here's the problem, my wife is 36 weeks pregnant, she doesn't and probably cant go to the concert because of the loud music, overcrowding, etc. When I say I still want to go, she is furious, and frequently cries about it (she is pregnant, so I understand the crying). I can't help but feel as if she is being selfish, and just because she can't enjoy the concert, doesn't mean I can't as well. What do you guys think? AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Ok this blew up. I just want to add further information. First of all, I see everyone getting upset at me, I understand, but please take into consideration, this is the reason I came to this subreddit, not because I feel as if I'm in the right, I am asking because I wanted to seek the opinions of others. I tried to sell the tickets, but no one has bought them. I put them up for sale 2 weeks ago, and the tickets totaled to $600. I asked all of our friends, and they are busy, so I didn't want them to go to waste. I said we planned it for a long time, that is the case. Since its her first pregnancy, she didn't know how she would feel, and now she isn't comfortable going. I also want to add we planned this with a group of friends, not just us. I didn't feel the need to add this information because personally I didn't think it would blow up. For those of you who are asking This band is very niche and hasn't toured in years, especially since COVID. She isn't worried about pre-term labor, just upset that I would go without her.

And you\u2019re going to loose money either way. No one is gonna pay the full value of the tickets, and if you went by yourself then the other ticket won\u2019t be used anyway. You have to get to a concert at least an hour early for parking, and when it\u2019s over it can take 30-60 minutes to get out of the lot. If it wasn\u2019t her favorite band, then I could see you going if you had a good plan in case something happened. \n\nBut I think it\u2019s not the actual concert she\u2019s upset about. She\u2019s upset because she wants you to stay home in solidarity with her. I think your wife just wants your emotional support that night because it\u2019s her favorite band too. It might not be rational, but she\u2019s got a soup of hormones going on that she can\u2019t do anything about. You both made a baby, she didn\u2019t get pregnant by herself. She\u2019s sacrificing her body, and you\u2019re sacrificing missing your favorite band. That\u2019s what happens when you become parents. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is TA really, it\u2019s just the circumstances of life right now.", "INFO: This situation confuses me. Did you buy the tickets before your wife was pregnant? You said you were planning this for \"a long time\" so you both knew she'd be 36 weeks pregnant at the time of the concert. What did you discuss about these plans? Also, what do you mean by \"probably can't?\" does your wife plan to go, or not, or only if she doesn't feel well? Have you discussed staying near the back and missing the openers, and if that would be calm enough for her to attend?\n\nI think the most key information for me here is this: Is this a band that tours/performs regularly? If so, have you considered waiting a year or two and seeing them with her next time they come around?", "INFO: Will this be the first time you're seeing them in concert? Has your wife seen them in concert yet? Will there be future chances to see them in concert?", "YTA. Your wife is more important than a concert. Put her first and sell the tickets to someone else. And buy her some flowers as an apology.", "You know what, I'm gonna go against the grain here and say NAH. I can sympathize with your wife as I'm 8 months along, but I wouldn't stop my spouse from going to a concert that's pre-paid especially if he couldn't sell the tickets. It's her first pregnancy so she's probably extra emotional which happens, just sit down with her and try once more for a calm civil conversation. Lay out all the facts and make sure she knows if something happens, you'll leave the concert immediately and go home to her which means probably no drinking for you", "Is it selfish of her to want you not to attend the concert because she can't? Kinda! Is this a time to insist on selflessness from a person who has been carrying your future child for nine months and about to undergo a physically and mentally exhausting ordeal on your family's behalf? Hint: do you think she got pregnant for the sheer unadulterated hell of it?\n\nNOPE!\n\nYTA. Don't be a dick and make your wife feel bad. Sell the tickets and stay home with her. Make a night of it  with her favorite takeout and listening to your favorite albums together.", "YTA.\n\nBe serious. How do you think she feels knowing that you're going to go to a concert that she would enjoy, but can't go?\n\nBesides, this late in the pregnancy, she definitely needs your support and assistance. What if something goes wrong while you're at the concert? At this point, I would be putting all activities that place you out of reach on hiatus.", "How pregnant will she be the day of the concert? Is it safe for her to be left alone? Is there a chance she might go into labour? When you asked her why she was furious what did she say?", "NAH. As a woman who goes to tons of concerts (some while pregnant!) there is nothing wrong with going by yourself. She's got understandable FOMO, but it's pretty selfish to expect you to miss out on this experience because she is choosing not to go. That being said, you probably can't relate to it understand the truly would emotions and thoughts a pregnant person has, so decide how important this is to you, this might be a hill you die on.", "NTA.. go to the concert and have a good time. Me and my wife are in a similar boat. There is a concert coming up in about 8 months. We both wanted to go but for me the price was too high to consider going. My wife was fine spending that amount I wasn\u2019t. I fine with staying home even though he was on my bucket list to see before he dies.", "Metal chick here who went to concerts pregnant.   Unless it's a drive from a hospital she can totally go.  Just not to close to speakers", "[deleted]", "Unpopular opinion.  Nta. As a woman who has had 3 kids, go to the concert. Enjoy yourself.  Wife is being selfish.  Why waste the tickets? I personally like have 1 day or evening by myself to relax.", "NTA. So you're supposed to just eat the money and spend every moment with your wife until she gives birth? I don't see what the issue is as long as you can be reached and the concert isn't very far away,", "I\u2019m going with NTA. Why waste the tickets? She\u2019s being selfish.", "[deleted]", "Have either of you been to their concerts before?  \n\n\nI guess my thing would be...even if you think she's being irrational is this really a hill you wanna die on? Making your very pregnant wife that upset this close to giving birth? Do I think she's a bit over the top being \"furious\"? Yeah, personally, but still I'd suck it up and not go until she could go. YTA", "NTA. You\u2019re not attached at the hip. This is such a stupid petty reason to be upset with you. If you were sick would you expect her to stay home from going out with friends or to a concert because you couldn\u2019t go, I sure hope not. She can suck it up and either go and stand in the back or sit in a seat where ever the non crowded place is, there is always non crowded places because that\u2019s where people do not want to be and you can stand with her or she can stay home and be upset.\n\nWanting someone else to pass up a good time because you can\u2019t or won\u2019t do it is so annoying self centred.", "She's sacrificing her entire body and mental health to grow your child. She can't drink, eat certain foods, or even sit comfortably. How have you contributed to the growth of this baby...\n\nYou haven't. How about you make a small sacrifice and stay home. YTA", "NTA, I will be in the minority but I don't understand why most people here think that the universe revolves around someone who is pregnant, it would be wrong for you to go if you are close to the birth of your child, I would go to the show as you said it would be if first concert and your wife can go with you in the future and one night is no big deal", "YTA. Leaving her at home would not be cool on your part at all. She introduced you to the band and can't go because she's carrying your child. Try harder bro lol. Sorry I know it sucks and probably stings a little but the sacrifice is necessary. Don't be an AH.", "YTA Dude, don't go to that concert. YTA", "NTA and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get downvoted but I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s can\u2019t just say go have fun and enjoy with the group of friends that are going. When I was hugely pregnant, I encouraged my husband to go do things and didn\u2019t hold him back at all. This is a weird thing for her to be upset about. It\u2019s your first time seeing the band you love so she should understand your excitement. She\u2019s being childish.", "YTA. Being so far into her pregnancy is difficult enough for her as is, and to go to the concert while she misses out on going with you only adds fuel to the fire. This is a time you need to be there for your wife - maybe she needs you now more than ever. Skipping out on this concert for your wife, who is carrying *your child*, is a worthwhile sacrifice here. You can always book another concert in the future so she can experience it with you.", "So I understand at that point that her going to a concert could be hard on her. Did you try and say well wear headphones that are noise canceling wear a mask etc. and be able to go with you? How would you feel if she went into labor and you\u2019re at the concert and she has the kid and you\u2019re not there?\n\nYou have to do what\u2019s right for you and your family. I guess go without her but she probably will never go to a concert with you again. And be prepared for the silent treatment. But do what you wanna do I guess", "This is a hard one.  I feel like she\u2019s frustrated with your level of attention towards her over other things besides just this issue, otherwise she\u2019d probably let you go and just have a girls night in with friends while you\u2019re gone.  Additionally, you could show more understanding and trade favors toward her (either right away or after the baby comes), which she would appreciate (there are probably lots of opportunities here)", "Since when can't pregnant people go to concerts? Genuinely confused by this take.", "NTA for wanting to go. And I don't think that she should be mad that you're having fun without her. But, this far along in the pregnancy, she could go into labor pretty much any time. So unfortunately I don't think that you get to go. I think she's an asshole if she's mad at you for wanting to have fun without her. But she's not an asshole if she wants you to be there in case she goes into labor. Those are two totally different things. People who are bitter about others having fun without them suck. But people who miss out on their wives labors also suck more. \n\nLike if I have a medical problem and I can't go to a concert, I would be thrilled if my friends got to have fun and go without me. And if a friend with a medical problem got mad at me for going to a concert without them, I would not like them.  Better someone to go then nobody gets to go. But, this is different because her labor requires your assistance.", "NTA. Just because she can\u2019t go why shouldn\u2019t you? You\u2019re going out for a few hours, not out of town. Next time they are in town you can go together, or she can go out with her friends and you stay home with the baby.", "NAH. I get her being upset, but I also understand wanting to see this band you\u2019re so invested in. Doesn\u2019t make either of you an AH in my book. \n\nStill, if you\u2019re smart, don\u2019t go.", "YTA. Your wife (and life partner) can't go because she's busy growing your child inside her body. That's a huge task and it's making huge, life-altering changes to her body.\n\nAnd here you are putting a good time ahead of supporting her in this huge undertaking. And expecting her to suck it up about being left home alone to grow your child while you go party. \n\nA better partner would give up the concert just for the sake of solidarity and being supportive.", "NTA. Seeing your edit, the tickets would go to waste if you don't go. However, you should continue to do your best to sell them. Also this is NOT the hill you want to die on. Make sure that your wife is (and knows that she is) your priority. Remember that the reason why she doesn't want to to go, is because she thinks it is something special between you two. If you go, you just might ruin that.", "INFO:\n\nIs her issue that she's scared of being alone while that pregnant (premature labor, etc) or is she just upset about FOMO?", "NTA. You were supposed to go together and SHE's the one that isn't able to go", "NTA, plain and simple. You're allowed to enjoy things without being made to feel like a jerk about it.", "Your wife is sacrificing her literal body to grow a baby, I think you can skip a concert for her.

From the kid whose own mother had tickets to a concert at 34 weeks and went into labor the same day. She missed the concert and I'm pretty sure she didn't forgive my premature self.

This is something that ya'll planned to do together and now that she can't, you are gonna go anyway. \n\nThat baby can show up AT ANY POINT from here on out.  If you're at the concert, you're not near her. You're out there doing something loud that you two enjoyed together while she's home feeling awful (there is a whole baby in her body taking her vitamins and minerals and energy and sometimes kicking her from the inside out) and you \"don't want to waste\" concert tickets.", "NTA - Personally I think being upset others are enjoying things when you can't, to whatever reason is normal but still your own problem. Pregnancy sucks imo, but she's still her own person and hopefully capable of enjoying an evening relaxing alone, even if you're doing something she'd like to do herself. You tried to sell or give away the tickets, which puts this in NTA territory for me. That said this is your relationship, you know better than any of us if she will be able to get over this or if it's going to cause long term problems, which no concert is worth imo.\n\nIs there a compromise here somehow? Could you go to the concert with your friends and have a pampering/spa day with your partner beforehand?", "YTA - you do realize that the reason she's pregnant is because of you, yeah?  The fact that she is having both of yours child should be enough to put ANYTHING on hold!  Especially this late in the pregnancy.  Who the fuck cares how niche the band is.  This is your wife and soon to be born child.  I really hope that you are a better father than you are a husband (or ex-husband at this point)", "YTA.  You never ditch your pregnant wife.

Husband went w his best friend. I urged him to stay the night in the city because I wanted him to be able to embibe and enjoy himself. We have a 4yo as well and I knew it was going to be a long time before he would be able to enjoy time with his friends in the foreseeable future. \n\nAlso, during this most recent pregnancy and my first I had tickets to see my most favorite band (sane band, different tours) and both times my husband made me sell my tickets because I was in my third trimester and he was worried for the baby. Fair enough, I sold my tickets. I was upset but knew he was right. \n\nTL;DR... this shouldn't be a big deal. There are more important things. I guess you could have cushioned the blow by giving her a spa day with a friend while you were at the show, but not necessary.", "YtA. You stay home and carry the baby day of concert see how u feel when she goes.   Is it your child? He", "y\u2019all might hate me whatever but nta. do people seriously expect you to never do anything your spouse would enjoy unless they\u2019re there? the pregnancy, while it\u2019s the reason she can\u2019t go, really has nothing to do with the question since you say it\u2019s not about possibly missing the birth its just she\u2019s mad you\u2019re enjoying something without her. if i were her i would sulk and pout and cry but ultimately you aren\u2019t an asshole for going. especially since you said it\u2019s a group going so it\u2019s not like it was a couple thing that you\u2019re doing without her.", "WHOS THE BAND", "NTA.

Pregnancy isn't a disease. There's no indication that husband needed to be constantly available. \n\nIn 2001, I was hugely pregnant with triplets. It was a high risk pregnancy. Hubby got tickets to see his very favorite band with SIL & BIL. I wasn't comfortable going, so I didn't go. Had it been a singleton pregnancy, I might have considered going.\n\nThey had a great time and I was fine at home for one single evening.\n\nTwo weeks later, I went into premature labor while husband was at a work event.

I\u2019ve gone to concerts pregnant, I be gone to concerts with babies strapped to me.

And concerts depending on the genre isn't necessarily a safe place to be that heavily pregnant. The last thing she needs is to get caught in a crowd crush.", "Yup. Go to the show. \n\nShe's full of baby and sour grapes. It sucks for her, but that doesn't mean it has to suck for you.

Also a band that does not tour often so it\u2019s rare to be able to see them live. But my concert was a few weeks after I went through a dreadful C-section.  I sucked it up and went to the concert.  But had I been unable to go, I wouldn\u2019t have stopped my husband from going. Not sure what having two people miss an awesome concert would accomplish.", "You're not in the minority by any means. I actually have been pregnant and was active up until the last moment.  Is there something wrong with his wife other than being pregnant? I'm sure she feels like a refrigerator with arms and legs right now but that shouldn't stop her from enjoying the concert.  OP has not said she has a medical condition nor that the concert is taking place far from where they live. If they had to travel to another city and overnight I could understand her being nervous about being far away from her doctor and hospital,  and same concerns if he went alone.  But he hasn't said that so we have to assume it's not an issue.  And I certainly think he would have mentioned if it was a high risk pregnancy or she had other medical issues but we must assume she is healthy.  Therefore,  I don't think she's in any danger by going to the concert other than being uncomfortable maneuvering around.  If I decided that I didn't feel comfortable about going, I certainly wouldn't stop my husband from going. The Band is an old band and who knows how much longer they will be around? This may be is only chance to see them.

I was incredibly sad, still haven\u2019t seen them live but my husband had a great time that night. No reason for him to miss out. \n\nSome time later he bought me a ticket to something else and it was the only seat left in that area so he sent me alone\u2026 on my birthday.

People jump to such ridiculous conclusions on this sub, I honestly don't even know why people post on here.", "OP said she will be 36wks. First babies are not usually early.  Always a chance of going into labor, but the dude goes to work for 8 hours a day so...a few hours at a concert is really not much different", "You're acting like she had no say in getting pregnant lol. Wtf. \n\nI'd be so pissed at my husband for wasting money like that.", "So he is TA for wanting to go to a concert? His wife has a choice between if she goes or not, and if she says she doesn\u2019t want to now suddenly the man has to throw everything out of the window because she is pregnant?

I think her issue isn\u2019t that he is doing it and she is missing out but to her this was something special that the two of them shared together and she feels dismissed and marginalized because he will experience it without her when she saw this as a joint venture. I\u2019m not saying she is necessarily right- but at 36 weeks your hormones have messed with your head completely- you already feel not a part of a lot- especially if your pregnancy is going in a way where you are having to forgo quite a number of things. Again not saying she is right or rational, but probably for her it\u2019s symbolic of other things that she sees could be changing in their relationship going from just them to them and a baby.

And does it really matter? \n\nFunny thing I just remembered we went to a show when I was pregnant with our first- English Beat I think - but I was a little less than 36 weeks- and it ended up not working for me- I think standing room only and some other things(maybe a lot of jostling around and people bumping into each other). My husband stayed (at my insistence) and I took off for a girlfriends place close by and we spent time together hanging out. But I also didn\u2019t care as much about who we were seeing.

Maybe you can model self-sacrifice for the sake of your new little family in a way that will be a great example to her and pay huge dividends in the long run.

Worst case, she can call 911.", "I was curious about the data on that.  \n\n[https://towardsdatascience.com/are-first-babies-more-likely-to-be-late-1b099b5796b6](https://towardsdatascience.com/are-first-babies-more-likely-to-be-late-1b099b5796b6)\n\n>**If \u201cearly\u201d means preterm \u2014 before 37 weeks of pregnancy \u2014 first babies are more likely to be early.** Based on live births recorded in the National Survey of Family Growth, about 12% of first babies are born preterm, compared to 10% of other babies.\n\n[https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20171127-the-truth-about-three-childbirth-myths](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20171127-the-truth-about-three-childbirth-myths)\n\n>First babies are less likely to be born on the due date than subsequent children.

With my pregnancies I would not have been cool with a friend taking me or riding alone in an ambulance to the hospital, but my spouse is also a very involved parent and was actively at my side for every part of all of my pregnancies. I realize many partners are not interested in that (though I literally would never have had kids at all if it wasn't with a person as involved as he is.)", "We are all different. I wasn't so concerned for my partner to be there for every minute. Truth be told, in medical situations, I do better without my partner.  They get anxious and end up annoying me with questions. Also, when in pain, I do not want to be touched or any verbal comfort. Nurses have teased me that I am like a wounded bear. Let me crawl into my cave and be alone. \n\nYes, I allowed my partner to be there for the birth,  but there was a no talking and don't touch me rule. \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03", "Your so right. I want to see my partner enjoy life, with or without me. And seriously who are we to tell another grown person what they can or can\u2019t do. It\u2019s fine to voice your opinions but also be able to handle it when it doesn\u2019t line up with your thoughts. Idk\u2026I don\u2019t ever want to be with someone who doesn\u2019t want to see me have fun simply because they can\u2019t\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "My boyfriend introduced me to my now favourite band. \n\nI am doing a stay abroad and they played a gig in our city. I told him to go, have fun and make me jealous. \n\nNight of, I asked why he wasn\u2019t at the gig. He said: \u201eI just do not want to see them without you.\u201c \n\nGod I love this man.\n\nBut\u2026 I can\u2019t bring myself to say Y T A . Kind of, but not really. \nShe\u2019s allowed some leeway at 36 weeks. It\u2019s hard to miss a concert, I get it.\n\nSo I\u2019ll go with NAH.", "Seriously, NTA. One of my favorite bands was touring, I had purchased tickets and was super excited (before COVID times) but had tour bus issues the day before they were supposed to play, and skipped my town completely. They said they\u2019d come back eventually, which they did, ten months later, when I was 8 months pregnant. I ultimately ended up not going, as it was a metal show at a small venue and I felt it would have been too risky, but if my husband had wanted to go, I would have been all for it. I would have been bummed, but just because I can\u2019t enjoy something doesn\u2019t mean that he doesn\u2019t get to enjoy something. There\u2019s no reason for thinking like that!", "Thank you. I don\u2019t think there are any AHs here. OP isn\u2019t an AH for wanting to go, and his wife isn\u2019t an AH for feeling sad about missing out. It\u2019s a band she introduced him to, a concert she\u2019d been looking forward to, and likely one of the first of many fun times out with friends she\u2019ll miss out on due to motherhood. That has to be hard to process, especially under the influence of so many hormones, and while nearing the end of her pregnancy. Feeling left out and sitting at home alone while OP is out having fun with their friends is a shitty feeling, and of course she isn\u2019t coping with her feelings entirely rationally \u2014 she\u2019s 36 weeks pregnant.\n\nOP, consider that your lives are about to change forever, and for your wife, her body is about to change forever, too. She\u2019s only days to weeks away from enduring one of the scariest and most painful experiences in her entire life, and it doesn\u2019t get any easier from there. You\u2019re not wrong for wanting to go, but show her some compassion, too. Maybe think about ways you could make the night fun for her, too \u2014 does she have a girlfriend she could have over? Could you order them delivery food and treat her to a fun at-home activity? Maybe an in-home massage? Video call her from the concert during her favorite song, so she can be there with you for a few minutes? Reassure her you\u2019ll check your phone regularly in case of emergency? I think showing her a bit of love and empathy could go a long way toward smoothing things over.", "As a mum of 3, I agree. Definitely NTA. I don\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t go or won\u2019t go? I didn\u2019t get to go to any shows during any of my pregnancies, unfortunately but I imagine all mine would have had the best time since they all love music. \n\nIf they\u2019re not selling why flush that $600? Go out, have a good time! If there is legit nothing wrong with her and nothing stopping her from going, she\u2019s being selfish.", "So because he wife is choosing not to go and have fun he shouldn't have fun? selfish", "To do what exactly? At 36 weeks, I kind of wanted to just lounge on the sofa eating ice cream. He could set up food/snacks and arrange for a friend to hang out with wife for the evening.  \n\nHe can check in frequently to make sure all is good. Concerts are a few hours, not an entire week. Wife can certainly manage for a few hours", "Why should he miss out on something he already paid for, his wife is being selfish. I don't understand why as soon as someone is pregnant no body can do what they can't do, eat what they can't eat etc.", "There are probably accommodations for that though", "Now if this was me, I basically shove the husband out and take a long ass bath while eating my favorite ice cream. Haha", "Yeah same. I literally did this when we had a newborn and also had concert tickets. \"Hey, why don't you take a friend and I'll stay home.\" Also got me mad wife points and a bunch of free sleep in day bc he was so happy. I'm currently pregnant again and I'd do the same. Hormones suck but NTA.", "I agree with you. But it can be a bit hazardous lol... I did the same thing when I was expecting my third child. I was as 38 weeks, and it was my husband's christmas party, which for sure would include a lot of drinking.  I was like \"Go, fly like a bird, enjoy yourself!\". Of course, a couple of hours after he left my water broke. Luckily he had only had one drink when I called him, and he wasn't super far away.\n\n(For context: Our first two babies went over the due date by 14  and 15 days, so I stupidly thought it was safe...)", "Holy shit! That was the year! Gwar, Filter, Alice in chains!", "Yeah I've never been pregnant but I have so many friends and family that have and while they and I would all agree that the world doesn't revolve around them at the same time the shit you sacrifice when you're pregnant is really rough. Your body, your dignity, your privacy, your bodily autonomy, and then there's the foods, the tiredness, lots of physical hobbies, sleep, all go out the window. I totally get why she would be absolutely gutted that she can't go to something she loves and kinda mad OP is. Is OP wrong, not exactly, but this is marriage and love and it's not always about who is right and who is wrong and more about caring for the other person and recognising how they're feeling, even if it's not entirely rational on paper. As long as there's give and take and equal reciprocity along with mutual respect sometimes you can be 100% and still totally wrong. OP isn't an AH but I think the loving thing to do would be to stay home.", "She is not up to going to a concert they planned months in advance. An expensive concert nonetheless. She doesn't feel up to it, completely fair. Unfair is to ask to waste 600 bucks.\n\nI find it weird how she is so negative about this. He even said how he wants to sell the tickets, but nobody wants them. And he finds it a waste to not use them if tehy aren't sold (which it is)", ">she knew when they bought the tickets she was pregnant \n\nDid OP not know then that he impregnated her", "Dafuq kind of argument is this? \u201cHey we BOTH agreed to purchase this fully knowing I\u2019m pregnant but I changed my mind. You impregnated me so you can\u2019t go either since I\u2019m not going.\u201d Where does this stop? \u201cHey I love sushi but since I\u2019m pregnant you can\u2019t eat sushi too.\u201d Jesus people. The rest of the people aren\u2019t just NPCs around pregnant people.", "Well since he doesn\u2019t have to be in solidarity with her, why doesn\u2019t he just not be in the delivery room? Afterall she\u2019s pregnant not him!"]}
