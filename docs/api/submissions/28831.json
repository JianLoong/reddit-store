He doesn't want the responsibility, and from the sounds of it he's not the father (\"calls him daddy\" isn't the same as \"he's her father\") and not obligated to, so it's time to end it.\n\nSorry, but this will be a lesson learned.  With kids, especially special needs ones, you need to make sure your partner is 100% onboard and understanding of what's required if they're going to be in the kid's life.", "NTA-  SO he is fully aware the toddler will not get up on her own without being picked up and moved to somewhere else.  He chose to just not bother, might be the best thing if you part ways and find someone who is willing to follow boundaries you set for your kid.", "So\u2026 she just laid in bed? He checked on her and nothing was amiss? What exactly is your big problem here? YTA", "I\u2019m not sure without more info.\n\nIt sounds like she woke up and he tried to get her out of bed.  She refused.  He didn\u2019t want to fight with her and let her stay.  I\u2019m assuming he continued to ask and she continued to say no.\n\nTo me, that\u2019s not neglectful or abusive or any of the other wild accusations people are making.  If she was that hungry or needed the bathroom or whatever, she could have agreed to get up any of the times he tried.  She was in a safe spot. And could have agreed to leave at any time.  Now if he only asked her to get up once that\u2019s different.\n\nAs for breaking up, it sounds like you may have accused him of being neglectful/abusive. And I get why he wouldn\u2019t be okay with that.  If you really feel that way, you should be the one dumping him! And if you don\u2019t feel that way and it was an emotional overreaction, I see his side that he\u2019s not okay with that.", "I\u2019m having a rough time really branding him as an AH. He didn\u2019t just not check on her. She woke up, he checked on her, and she said she wanted to stay there. He chose not to fight with her. That\u2019s VERY different than her being unable to express herself or move and him just using it as an opportunity to ignore her.\n\nI get why you\u2019re upset because it\u2019s not what you would do. But I have to go with NAH.", "Were there any negative consequences of her staying in bed? Was she upset and crying? Seems like you should judge her reaction before reacting yourself. If it was comfortable and she wanted to stay, she wanted to stay. It seems to me like you are ignoring her input. Unless she was crying when you found her or had an accident in bed, it really seems like you're overreacting", "I don't think you're an AH, but I think you're being a bit harsh. He probably didn't see anything wrong with a child remaining in bed longer than usual. I can see him getting defensive for being \"attacked\" for what he considered to be nothing wrong. I would consider him an AH if a conversation about how autism affects your child specifically has happened in the past.\n\nMe being autistic I can see why you're upset. Not only is your toddler only 3 years old, and still learning to listen to her body when it comes to her needs, but she is autistic and is very likely she struggles with interoception issues. Asking her (if he did) whether she is hungry, rather than feeding her in a timely manner, might not work for your child. You know her better than anyone. He might not have considered this to be an issue and was trying to avoid a meltdown rather than not wanting to deal with her. If she calls him daddy and you trust him enough to leave her with him, I can assume he has not mistreated her or ignored her in the past. Maybe have a conversation about why this was an issue because of your daughter's needs. If he is not willing to have a conversation once you've both calmed down, or you have spoken about this in the past, then I do believe a breakup is the right solution. Wish you and your toddler the best.", "info: why is staying in bed awake is such a bad thing?", "I won't give a verdict in this case. I just notice that you are only replying to posts that validate you response / position. Any other info requesting post has been ignored.\nThis feels like a validation post and not one looking for honest feedback.", "NAH.  In every relationship I've seen where the couple had an autistic child there is one parent who is more of the warden, boundary setter and the other who struggles with it. \n\nIt sounds like he was fairly involved and helpful but maybe just had had it up to \"here\" that day and really didn't want to fight a toddler and felt that he should just let her stay in bed.  You gave him no grace or understanding.  If he was perpetually absent or didn't want to be involved I'd get it.  \n\nAre you perfect with her 100% of the time?  No parent seems to be.  \n\nI understand you being worried and mad but I think you went overboard.  However I *also* think your BF was looking for an escape hatch already so this isn't the reason for the break up.", "NTA but almost leaning towards ESH. I get you're upset but it just feels like a strange hill to die on. Is your daughter okay? Did she need medical attention or anything? Did she not sleep all night? Was she crying and distraught over this? Did he meet her immediate needs? You said yourself he probably checked on her. And he isn't the child's father, not wanting to have that fight actually doesn't seem that far fetched to me. Perhaps, as he isn't a father, he didn't know how serious it would be if he left the child in bed. To be honest, I also don't understand really why it's SUCH a big deal. A conversation, sure, but you got upset and were crying?\n\nIf you could provide info on how this longer nap negatively impacted your toddler (not you, your toddler), I'll gladly call him TA. You didn't mention if you've made this super clear to him in the past, that 2 hours is okay but 5 hours is not. I don't see any malicious intent. \n\nBut now you guys are broken up. So I guess that's almost irrelevant at this point.\n\nEdited to add: after reading some of OP\u2019s responses, all friendly and absolving her ex boyfriend of any wrongdoing, I\u2019m changing this to YTA.", "Your child's health and safety comes first.\n\nI would guess that this has been building for awhile... If not, you've learned that you'd bf will go nuclear over an argument.\n\nEither way, he's show his true colors.\n\nNTA", "Info: what happened to your child from being in bed so long?", "YTA.  So much the asshole.\n\nYour daughter was safe and cared for, There was no reason for her to get out bed except for your preference.  She was not missing a doctor's appointment, she was not missing a playdate, she didn't need a bath and she didn't want to eat.\n\nHe took care of her, tried to get her up, but didn't want to deal with an autistic meltdown for ABSOLUTELY NO REASON.  Why?  Why should he deal with hours of screaming and arguing with a 3 year old?\n\nThen, after an explanation, when any reasonable mother would realize it was fine, you got upset and started crying.  CRYING.  Over a child safe and supervised in her own bed.\n\nAfter your shameful display, your boyfriend set some VERY reasonable boundaries: don't ask him to watch her again if you are going to be unreasonable.  Then you huffed off to your mother's house just to be even more needlessly dramatic.  Then, you decided to text about a settled issue just to ramp up the drama even more and get in the last word.\n\nAfter all that needless drama, breaking up was incredibly reasonable and justified.  Your ex-boyfriend deserves better.", "YTA. Your daughter needs a special needs carer and that is not on your boyfriend to provide. Hire someone trained to deal with her", "YTA I\u2019m sorry but it\u2019s like a few hours extra. It\u2019s not like she was going to die or her life was in danger. \nTo expect perfection from someone everyday while dealing with a child with a disability is draining. Honestly seems like the guy checked out from all the pressure you put on him.", "NTA, and I agree with him that it\u2019s time to breakup if he is not interested in participating in appropriate care for your toddler. Having autism means your kiddo has a lot of extra stress and confusion and angst outside in the world. You love her and want what\u2019s best for her so you don\u2019t want her to have to deal with that in her home. It doesn\u2019t sound like your boyfriend is on board for being a good co-parent to your child which I think makes you two incompatible in the long run.", "YTA. Single moms are so quick to throw the daddy title at the first man who pays them any attention and allow their children to think that\u2019s their actual dad, then he disappears and the cycle continues. He may know tips and tricks but doesn\u2019t mean he has to use them. You dodged a huge one though. Imagine if you had a child with him", "Did he not feed, wash or change her? He completely ignored her for five hours? NTA for being upset about that. Who leaves a 3-year-old unattended for five hours? As overwhelming as managing a special needs toddler can be sometimes what he did was untenable (and potentially dangerous.) NTA. If he doesn't want to watch her, I can appreciate that. But, I'd break up with him today. This just won't work. She's not a doorknob. She's a baby. If a baby lives in your home - you can't ignore that she exists.", "NTA and it\u2019s best to break up.", "NTA  \n\n\nI would say to explain to him exactly why it's not okay for her to stay in bed like that, in a way he could understand.. but also if he's breaking up.. over this? Then something was definitely building below the surface in him and he's using this as an exit ramp..   \n\n\nI hope he comes to his senses, realizes what needs to be done different and doesn't leave since she's attached enough to call him daddy. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this, OP.", "NTA ...\n\nHowever, I'm not going to be harsh with him, either.  You have described a profoundly autistic child.  Should he have left her like that?  Absolutely no.\n\nShould you be expecting him to babysit a profoundly autistic child who has meltdowns getting out of bed? Also no.\n\nThere are no solutions.  And the older she gets, the worse this is going to be.  I'm so sorry.  It may be time to look into preschool for special needs.\n\nI'm also sorry that your relationship is ending \ud83d\ude14.", "NTA.   Your boyfriend isn't father material.  Let him go.  It takes a certain level of maturity and selflessness to parent any child, let alone one with special needs.  Your little girl needs and deserves better.  So do you.", "At the end of the day, you put your daughter first as you should, and he doesn't, so you have a difference in core values. He volunteered to watch her,  then ignored your wishes, you're nta to be mad, and are probably lucky to realize this before you guys got any more serious.", "NTA\n\nand yes, it is time to part ways with this person.  He is a child abuser, and thought it was no big deal.   He is not the right match for someone with a child that is neurodivergent.  He is probably not a good match for anyone that has a child.  I am so heartbroken for your sweetie he left in the bed for so long.  I hope she is ok now.  \n\nNothing is worse than the feeling of coming home to your child knowing she was neglected.  Good luck OP, hug the little one for me, an internet grandma.", "NTA but it sounds good that he's removing himself from being in charge of her care ever again.", "NTA, but breaking up might be the best bet, tbh.  If he can't be bothered with your child at 3, what is he going to be like with her over the next several years if you stay together?", "NTA\n\nHe was negligent when he agreed to watch your daughter. Granted, the child was safe in her room, but as you said she has special needs and doesn't seem to cry if she's hungry or thirsty. \n\nI agree you guys should break up - he doesn't  want to deal with your (not his) autistic daughter, and that's okay, and you don't want to deal with the fact that he won't be a good father figure, also okay. Good luck!", "He basically used her autism as a free babysitter. He knew she wouldn't move and he had no interest in treating her like a child he cared about. Please don't give this loser a second chance, he's shown you exactly who he is!", "NAH but it seems like he's been wanting to break up. It's very difficult looking after a child with special needs. I don't blame him. You also deserve someone who will want to step up.", "Maybe I watch too many crime shows but leaving children with a boyfriend or girlfriend for hours on end will always be a no on my books .", "NTA. He should know her particular quirks and behavioral habits by now.\n\n>he went defensive and told me not to ask him to watch her ever again\n\nsounds like despite kiddo calling him her daddy, he sees her as an inconvenient responsibility that he'd rather solely fall onto you.\n\nI'm so sorry everything came crashing down over this, but maybe when you're ready you'll be able to find someone who doesn't purposefully leave your child in a position where they are behaviorally trapped for hours on end. I'm autistic too, and I experience that kind of inertia too even as an adult. Toddlers absolutely need to be helped out of it so they can learn what their options are when that feeling happens!", "NTA. You cannot allow him to care for your child, and you should break it off. He does not care.", "Feels like he didn\u2019t wanna deal with the kid so hid her away", "FUCK HIM for neglecting your daughter because she\u2019s different. You and her are a package and he needs to embrace that or fuck off.", "Nta \nBut to me it kind of sounds like he was planing to break up anyway.", "NTA but it\u2019s time to break up. \n\nYou have a 3 year old that he is unwilling to take care of. That\u2019s a deal breaker. There\u2019s no way you\u2019re going to be able to move forward in a relationship without him accepting some responsibility for this child.  Yeah, the kid isn\u2019t his, but if he wants to be with you long term he has to accept her too. \n\nHe obviously doesn\u2019t, hence him wanting to break up. I think he\u2019s right. But he\u2019s still TA for how he treated your kid", "NTA. He should feel guilty. Instead he is defensive.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They\u2019d kill for an afternoon like that!", "the child has autism, the mom stated she won\u2019t ask for food/water or do anything unless she\u2019s made to, so for 3 ish hours she didn\u2019t get any water/food, idk what time that was nor how often a 3 year old eats but water? i think she would\u2019ve needed water at least once in that time \n\nplus just general safety concerns ab leaving a toddler alone for 3 hours in a dark shut room", "She didn't eat or drink anything for 5 hours. Didn't go to the bathroom or have her diaper changed, depending.", "I don't know how often he checked on her during the 5.5 hours. So aside from toddlers doing dumb things because they're toddlers - I don't feel like the toddler's health or safety was at risk. The boyfriend is a good person when it comes down to it.", "Were there any repercussions though? Like her not sleeping at night/throwing a tantrum after?", "Maybe you\u2019re the issue here, why do you insist on fighting with her to get her out of bed after a nap, does she have something pressing to do? Maybe she\u2019s tired and wants more rest, maybe she feels over stimulated outside of her room and wants to stay in her safe place for abit longer. If she refused to get out of her bed AT ALL then yes you may have to fight with her. But if she just wants to stay in bed afew hours longer I don\u2019t see a problem, she\u2019s 3 years old.", "I don't believe that's what happened, the child naps \"at most\" for 2 hours, and was there a total of 5.5 hours. And OP did acknowledge that the child was most likely checked on, and didn't mention dirty diapers or hunger or any negative ramifications, just that it made HER (OP, not the toddler) upset and made her cry.", "It was 5.5 hours total. I don't know how long she napped since I was at work, but a great nap is usually two hours, which leaves 3.5 hours she was in bed awake. Not trying to advocate for the boyfriend, but want to clarify and be transparent. \n\nThank you for commenting. I appreciate you.", "What?  Why does a 3 year old need to literally be force fed?  Or to be forcefully stimulated?  Or washed after a nap?  A nap isn't exactly a messy, sweaty activity that requires washing.  At least not the way any 3 year old I have ever seen naps.\n\nSo, she is autistic and special needs - how does that mean not fighting with her for an afternoon harming her in ANY way?  Is there some sort of instant bedsores that ONLY autistic children get?  I've never read about it.\n\nShe was checked on, she was given the option to get up, and she declined.  How is that detrimental to her?  She was not missing out on anything, she was not left alone in the house and locked in her room.\n\nThe child was safe and cared for, he just didn't force her into a meltdown for no good reason.  Her mom can deal with the meltdown when she gets home, the kid is going to be FINE.  One hundred percent fine.  Probably better than if she was forced to get up and then just screamed for 3 hours straight.  Autistic kids who scream that long get burst blood vessels and risk damaging their throat.  I'm sure she really missed out on important development.  Just loads of it.\n\nPlease, explain to me more about how not triggering a meltdown for ONE afternoon harmed this child.  Tell me how not triggering a fight and forcing the child to engage in activities she does not want at THREE YEARS OLD is going to permanently damage her mental development.  PLEASE.", "Unfed and unwashed? She would have been fed and washed afew hours ago, how much do you think toddlers eat? How dirty do you think she got during a nap? And she clearly didn\u2019t want entertainment, she wanted to stay in bed. Do you want to be constantly stimulated when you want to rest peacefully in bed?", "Is that sarcasm?", "Not bathing or feeding a child that doesn't want to be for 3 hours is not abuse. Get a fucking grip", "It was an extra 3 hours!  These responses are wild.", "For 3 hours not 3 days , do you eat and wash yourself every 3 hours? I know people that don\u2019t even drink water that often", "Your definition for neglect does not match mine.\n\nNot washing a 3 year old after a nap is not neglect.  Not the way any 3 year old I have ever seen naps.  He never withheld food, he just didn't force it on her.\n\nForcing her to get up and then force feeding her, over a 5 hour period, would be much more abusive in my opinion.", "Please don\u2019t become a parent. Or be friends with people who have kids. You\u2019re exactly the type of person that calls CPS for BS reasons, abusing the system. A 5 hour nap does not equal neglect", "But does that mean he peeked in on her or he fed and diapered and washed her? Its not in the narrative. That's why I asked.", "How do you check on her but let her sit awake with no attention or stimulation or activities for over 3 hrs?", "Good Lord. Uh un. NTA. Thats just never going to be OK. (I really just can't understand why he pulled this unless he wanted to provoke you into breaking up? I know it sounds Machiavellian. But no reasonable human being would ever think this is acceptable. Plus if anything had happened to her he wouyld have been responsible for that. And that's why I wondered if he truly was trying to provoke you into walking away?", "Did she say he was constantly checking on her? All I see is \"I'm sure he checked on her\". Yeah the dude wasn't a mega asshole or anything, but sounds like the level of care mom wants is not something she's going to get - so why not just break up? They're both better off - the child isn't going to go away.", "Thank you for your reply. I agree.", "How would she act if she didn\u2019t want to get up and he made her?\n\nIf he was going in frequently and saying \u201ctime to get up\u201d \u201clet\u2019s get a snack\u201d \u201clet\u2019s go do X\u201d \u201clet\u2019s use the bathroom\u201d and she refused, I don\u2019t think he handled it that poorly.  She was in a safe place and had the option to leave.  \n\nIf her refusing would mean he\u2019d have to wrestle her out of bed, manhandle her fighting and screaming, is that really the better option?", "I don't ant to give judgment here, but as a kid i often stayed 3 wake hours (and some sleeping before) in the same space. Very long car rides, being sick, wake up at night and didn't fall back asleep, when grandma was watching me and she had to do gardenwork or prepare a big meals etc.). \n\nIf she is not paralysed, she will move or cry if the position she is in is hurting her, right? \n\nSo laying in the same space vs crying and fighting - idk. Sure you can't do this often, but if you sense you are not in the right mindspace and will may lose patience with the fighting toddler, leaving her be is not that bad and maybe the safer option imo. \n\nBut if this was reason for a break up (assuming you only told him how it makes you feel and didn't got accusatory or insulting and you had an adult and mature argument w/o yelling and screaming) i think the relationship was on the edge of being over anyway.", "Because it\u2019s completely unhinged and based off nothing but assumptions by the poster?", "Because its a projection of what I saw as a possibility. I don't try to make sense of things that are irrational. And sometimes other people do. I have different experiences though than lots of people here, likely because I am older than 40?", "Is that true? I haven't seen OP mention that in the post, any edits or her responses here. I have asked her a few times, what needs weren't met, was the child in danger or hungry or needed a diaper change or anything. No answers. We can only assume what she said, that the child stayed in bed longer than usual and her boyfriend checked on her.", "in that case the problem is he didn't feed her?", "Well again, I ask, why did you make it such a big deal? You cried and went to your mom\u2019s. It sounds to me like maybe you realize you overreacted. You should apologize and try to make things right.", "Was your child upset? Did she have an accident? I ask because although we can all agree that BF should not have left her there, I believe your question was about whether your reaction made you the AH\u2014right?", "Oh totally, I'm asking too. Based on the information we've received, we have to assume the child was in good health, wasn't starving or thirsty, was changed, because OP didn't mention any of this. \n\nTruly, the only consequence of her boyfriends actions *that we know about at this moment*, is making OP cry, nothing about the health and well-being of the child.", "OP did not say the child was awake for over 3 hours, OP suggested in the past that the child would, if allowed, stay in bed awake for 3 hours. OP wasn't home and therefore has no idea if they child slept or was awake.", "You ask \u201cdo you want to get up?\u201d \u201cDo you want to get a snack\u201d \u201clet\u2019s go do X\u201d \n\nIf the child is screaming no at you or refusing in whatever way, maybe you assume they don\u2019t need/want stimulation or activities for now. 3 hours without a snack isn\u2019t going to harm anyone.", "That's a great point. \n\nI've battled this very thought a lot. Her bed is a safe space. But at what point do you decide something has to give, she can't lay in bed all day? (While the option to leave her bed is always there, the toddler will not move unless someone is there to get her.) When I came home, he was in a different room and the toddlers door was shut. \n\nIf he forced her out of bed, she would have cried. There wouldn't have been any manhandling or fighting but there would have been tears and probably wails. He knows the toddler. He knows how to distract her and has the means while being at home to ease an unwanted transition. \n\nPart of me thinks that yes, forcing her out of bed would have been the better option when compared to 5.5 hours of laying in the same space.", "Mom is the person who gets to decide whether he handled it badly. She is the person with all the information and an understanding of the child.", "Unfortunately, OP has so far been unwilling to answer questions like that. I wish she would.", "The toddler had a full diaper, but is fine. \n\nYou are correct. AITA for being upset he left her in bed so long.", "Were you able to have a calm discussion about it with him? Or did it escalate immediately with accusations?  \n\nJust wondering when he\u2019d last tried to get her up, how many times he tried.  Maybe he only tried once and was clearly in the wrong.  Or maybe he tried every 15 minutes and had only been out of her room for a few minutes when you got home.", "I think the OP realizes she was over reacting and a bit ridiculous in her own crying outburst. She only wants to feel vindicated. \n\nBased on the little info we have. The child was fine, safe and checked on multiple times. No real negative effect on the child and BF actually avoided extra stress and fights. I'm actually with the boyfriend. I'd probably decide to leave too if this was her hill to die on.", "She didn't seem upset. She was happy to see me walk into her room.", "Then I think you overreacted in this situation. \n\nThat being said, it did give you a good understanding of BF\u2019s limits as a partner and potential father for your child. \n\nDoes he understand why leaving her in bed was so problematic? Someone without much experience in caring for kids may genuinely not realize why this was such a big deal. This can be fixed with education.\n\nOr was it laziness or malice? This cannot be fixed unless he chooses to do so. \n\nBased on which one you think is true, act accordingly.", "It escalated quickly, unfortunately. \n\nI do not know how many times he checked on her, or tried to get her up. I immediately went and got her out of bed, and then tried to talk to him about it (talk is the key word. I was upset at this point but calm). He started yelling that he wasn't going to fight with her and not to ask him to watch the toddler again. He then went into our bedroom and shut the door. \n\nI started crying. I decided to go to my moms and told him where I was going. When I got there, I got a bunch of shitty text messages, sent some shitty ones back, he broke up with me and I blocked him.", "So why did you cry?", "So what\u2019s the issue here then?"]}
