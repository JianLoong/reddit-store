I know everyone is going with N T A, but I will buck the trend here and say your kids deserve better, and so do you.  \n\nYou are only an AH for staying with this verbally/mentally abusive AH and having your kids around this behavior.", "NTA the kids were thanking you for going to get the food. Next time tell him to pick it up if he wants to be thanked", "Was he right about paying for dinner? I know you pull your money but those aren't his children and he has no responsibility to pay for them (that's on you and their father). If the bills were divided by 3 (I'm treating you kids as a unit) is your welfare enough to cover your 2/3rds.\n\nIt's a massive frustration for many step parents that they do not get acknowledged or thanked for their contribution. I think he should have handled it with you in private but if you are buying dinner with your partners contribution I think it's polite for your children to thank him.\n\nFor reference my daughter's have to thank both my husband and I (he is their father) when either of us buys something special because we are doing it with joint money.", "Not the AH\nIt's in the vows. \n Better or worse \nRigher or poor \nSickness and health.\n\nI'm sure you feel bad enough you can't contribute like want to at the moment.

He was in a fine mood, until I thanked him for the food. I've tried having civil, adult conversations with him, but nothing gets through. For example, I know he was mad at me, so I asked why he wasn't eating. He suddenly wasn't feeling well. All evening, he ignored me, even went to bed early. I asked him a few times through the evening how he was feeling, and no improvement.  My point is, he won't straight up tell me he's upset with me and have a decent convo. Sigh.

I'm very vocal with my love for him, how handsome he is, boosting his self-esteem whenever I can, having dinner ready when he comes home from work.. etc. Sadly, he makes zero effort to have relationships with my kids. He only points out when they've done something wrong, and gives them heck. I'm a human buffer between him and the kids.. trying to make everyone get along.

It's a treat that was purchased with at minimum joint money but probably more his money than hers since I doubt unemployment covers all her bills let alone something special for dinner. \n\nBigger items are planned they aren't a nice surprise like getting takeout. You should thank both the person who collected/thought of the items and the person/ppl who paid. Hence, when I bought indian last Friday on my way home from work out daughters thanked both of us - even though we are their parents with a legal obligation to feed them - because they know we pay for this with joint money.
