My husband, let\u2019s call him Mark, took him to get a lock and jake chose a lock with a key. Mark suggested he get a combination lock so he wouldn\u2019t have to worry about losing the key. Jake explained that it would be easier for him to open it with a key, so Mark got him the lock with the key. Fast forward 4 weeks, Jake has dropped the key in Mark\u2019s car and the school had to break the lock so Jake could get in his locker. Jake, tells me and his dad what happened and that he will need a new lock. Mark blows up on him, you would think he insulted his grandmother and spit on her grave saying things like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe how completely irresponsible you are\u2026how could you not take care of it\u2026 I told you this was going to happen\u2026how are you going to be a functioning adult,\u201d and starts bringing up how Jake left his air pods in his pants and they ALMOST got washed. \n\nI sent Jake to his room and started a conversation with Mark telling him how I think he went a little overboard. I said, \u201cI know he messed up he definitely should\u2019ve been more mindful about the key and also should\u2019ve kept track of his AirPods better but calling him completely irresponsible is a little harsh.\u201d Jake is a student athlete, straight \u201cA\u201d student and volunteers at school to help struggling students, to me he is far from irresponsible. I told Mark, we\u2019re all human and mistakes happen our job is to teach our kids, not break them down. He said I was babying him because I\u2019m forgetful too, \u201che gets his irresponsibility for you!\u201d Not going to lie he got under my skin. I told him, \u201cI\u2019ve saved your stuff from going into the wash multiple times, I\u2019ve washed your AirPods (by accident) twice, the dog chewed up your wallet twice because you left it lying around, and I\u2019ve washed your wallet three times (by accident) because you don\u2019t take it out of your pants, every day I have to remind you to take out the trash, I have to remind you walk the dog, I have to pick up your socks that you stuff into the couch because you\u2019re to lazy to put them in the hamper. If he\u2019s irresponsible he isn\u2019t the only one!\u201d I feel like if adults make mistakes, lose stuff, and say the wrong thing a child should be given some slack after all they\u2019re kids! He said the only reason he was mad was because he told Jake to get a combo lock and he didn\u2019t want to and now he has to go buy a new one. I said if you knew this was going to happen why wouldn\u2019t you just get the lock you thought was better. If you would\u2019ve done that you wouldn\u2019t be acting like an irresponsible jerk calling everyone names!

There are a few lessons that Jake needs to learn from this to be a successful adult, and a lesson your husband needs to learn if he wants a relationship with his son when his son becomes an adult and isn\u2019t required to interact with him\u2026\n\nTeens make mistakes, lots of them.  They are learning, their frontal lobe which is where executive function or decision making occurs isn\u2019t fully developed until a person is 26.  That\u2019s why teens tend to make really bad, obvious to adults, decisions.\n\nThe thing that parents need to do is approach the mistake from a learning exercise.  There needs to be consequences, he made a decision that had ramifications, he was warned, he owns the consequences of having to pay for a new lock.  He also needs to learn to think through or walk through the whole picture.  Jake being a teen was thinking he didn\u2019t want to have to remember a lock combo when he could just use a key.  But he isn\u2019t used to carrying keys because he doesn\u2019t drive or have a car yet.  I would assume he probably doesn\u2019t have house keys either.  So he didn\u2019t think about how he was going to keep track of the key without losing it.  Your husband when choosing the lock, should have walked Jake through thinking about how he was going to keep the key and where because a lost key would lead to the current mess.  Instead, your husband did what my husband used to do which was to tell our son the answer rather than teaching him how to think through the options, pros and cons, and how he was going to manage the key.  Then inevitably because your husband didn\u2019t force him to think through managing the key, the key was lost, the lock cutoff, and your husband yells.\n\nYelling doesn\u2019t teach teens how to problem solve or prevent problems from occurring or prevent making the same mistake twice.  All yelling does is teach the kid to hide things from his parents, because they can\u2019t be trusted to give advice.  Your husband is pushing his child away by yelling.  Your son is a teen, this is when you and hubby need to be advising and mentoring, not telling and yelling.\n\nYour husband is a teller and yeller.  His methods are teaching his son to be a liar and hider to avoid the yelling.  This can have tragic consequences in the teen years\u2026", "NTA.", "NTA.\n\nSo your kid had a $20 broken, and your husband went totally off on him. When you stepped in, he went off on *you*. Then when you pointed out he was being a hypocrite, he got defensive.\n\nSounds like there\u2019s something else going on, and your husband is venting his stress on his family. Good for you for standing your ground.", "NTA", "No, you're NTA; but your husband needs therapy.", "NTA\n\nI\u02bbm sure right now your husband is wishing you didn\u02bbt have such a good memory.", "NTA.. but why would you think you are?  Your husband is/was ( i hope) acting a jerk and should apologize. Maybe it just was stress for something else, but he kinda of needs to figure out why he went off on your son.", "He is a great kid! I\u2019m so lucky tho because all three are great kids. That was my point that everyone makes mistakes it\u2019s how you fix them that matters. No one can be perfect all the time", "Im so glad you see my point. That\u2019s exactly what I tell him. If you\u2019re an ass about the small stuff they won\u2019t come to you with the big stuff and that\u2019s the stuff I care about.", "Agree! Being extra snippy lately honestly tho I don\u2019t care  talking like that to your wife and kid about something as stupid as a key is not okay.", "Exactly who doesn\u2019t misplace their keys once in a while. He claimed I was taking sides I said there are no sides were a family. He kept missing my point and saying that we need to teach him to be responsible. HE IS RESPONSIBLE!", "Exactly, you've definitely got this handled \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb", "As someone also dealing with middle school combination locks (and tbh a forgetful child), I'd suggest the kind where you can pick the code yourself, rather than the preset.", "> If you\u2019re an ass about the small stuff they won\u2019t come to you with the big stuff \n\nExactly.", "And I mean yes you do need to teach him to be responsible, if he weren\u2019t already. TEACH. This would be like calling him stupid for getting a math problem wrong at school.", "Since it doesn't take much more than just some time and effort to find out the code and unlock it, schools here usually advise against code locks.", "Agree!"]}
