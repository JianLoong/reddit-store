It opens the door for them to ask questions or try to get around it. It's your house; you don't have to explain your rules to anyone.", "Nta. I was looking at a kids book yesterday. It was Clifford the big red dog\u2019s book about manners and it was like Clifford always calls ahead when he wants to visit his sister\u2019s house. It showed him howling.", "NTA\n\nIt's now a home that both of you share and you need privacy. What if they walked in the house and yall were doing the dirty? Would they just sit in the living room and wait for you to finish so they can say hi?? If you are living with someone then there needs to be clear cut rules before hand. I hate to say it sucks you didn't discuss this prior to buying the home because if that was an issue you would have known to maybe make it clear ahead of time but hindsight is 20/20 as the saying goes", "NTA. Just have your wife tell her family you guys don't want them walking in when yall are having relations. Awkward for everyone", "This should have been discussed before they bought a house together. This is a major difference between the two. Whichever way this goes means one of them isn\u2019t going to be happy. A compromise will need to be reached fairly soon or the relationship isn\u2019t going to work.", "Nta. Its not her house, it's both of your house and you both deserve to be comfortable there. It's okay to want time to yourself without guests. If they have a problem with calling or texting ahead they're the assholes", "Nta", "No way, boundaries are the space at which you can love yourself while simultaneously loving others. If they can\u2019t respect that, they are the problem!", "I feel like it would have been better to make this boundary earlier in your relationship before you bought a house with that norm already established. But better late than never! NAH", "NAH but this is a conversation you should have had before purchasing the house. Make sure BEFORE you get married that you discuss finances, what happens if one gets sick or dies, kids (and related religion and discipline issues). Seriously, this is  where ALL problems lie, in lack of communication in relationships.", "NTA.\n\nKind of similar situation for me.  We recently bought a large place which is our extended family compound;  my wife and I have the one part of a duplex, my daughter and her partner have the other half of the duplex, and my son has the garden suite.  The main stipulation of this arrangement was that we would rigidly respect each other's privacy;  no entering the others' space uninvited.  Well, yesterday my son walked into our house while my wife and I were, well, not wanting company.  I'm pretty sure my son won't do that again.  We're thinking of putting up a sign to really razz him, \"If the house is rockin'...\".", "Yes. Don't be a limp dick, do it yourself. My go to is, No phone call, no pants. Also if you call or visit after 8.30pm on a week night, we may entertain you, however I will point out that it's rude, you're being rude but, meh, I answered the door/phone in my jocks, so wodaya want?", "NTA. What if you had JUST tested positive for COVID, or just gotten home, or you and your SO were having sex? \n\nYou are asking for a reasonable boundary.", "NTA.\n\nHow much of a burden is a heads up. It's a text!", "They\u2019re not as close as they say if a simple request to check before coming over upsets them. Close, loving people embrace reasonable boundaries.", "NTA, just wandering in unannounced could lead to some seriously awkward situations.", "NTA they\u2019ll adjust. She needs to just have your back.", "NTA  she\u2019s not alone anymore but lighten up about it. That\u2019s your family too now.", "NTA in the past, many years ago, my family learned very quickly not to show up unannounced. I just would not answer the door. If they showed up while I was outside then outside is where they stayed.\nI simple told them that my time is just as precious as theirs. I never showed up at their homes unannounced and prefer they be the same with me. Also,  just because they call doesn't mean I need to answer the phone either.", "These days, texting before you come over is as standard as knocking on the bathroom door if it  is closed.", "When my adult daughter moved out I told her she was welcome to visit at any time, but to please give us a heads up because I would not be responsible for her therapy if she walked in on something she didn't want to see. I didn't even have to specify,  I think the mental picture was plenty \ud83d\ude05", "That's how my cousin finally got her mother in law to stop popping by every day unannounced", "Once we moved out, my parents, apparently, became nudists--they live in the middle of nowhere with a treeline and no nearby neighbors. My brother made the mistake of showing up to their place, to witness them playing badminton in nothing but sneakers. He remebers to call first since then.", "It\u2019s the same with me. My three best friends have a key and all know they can show up any time BUT I need at least a five minute warning in case I am just in only my knickers that day (especially in summer).", "This is a very important distinction", "Maybe also be let it be known, this applies to everyone, friends and family, not just them.", "not really, no.. her family is more typically working class than mine, that's about it", "My parents are divorced. I definitely call and plan with my dad. My mom has been very explicit that I can/should just show up whenever. Just depends on the person really", " The issue I'm having is why boundaries need to be reciprocated? Boundaries are individual designations, I have a key to my parents' house,  they don't expect to get one to the house I share with roommates. Each situation is different.", "If their parents have said its ok to do that then its fine but regardless unless youve been told to just show up whenever you feel like it. The polite thing to do is call/text ahead of time", "Your issue relies on the assumption that OP's parents don't enjoy that system", "but are the ducks dressed", "If you didn't, then you need to do so now. Before you talk about it, decide for yourself if this is a deal breaker or if you can be flexible about it. Then try to set boundaries that you can agree on as a team. It would have been better to hash it out before cohabiting, but the sooner the better now.", "Yeah my parents were thrilled when I would drop by back in the day.  But that's the balance we had.  Their house used to be my house.\n\nNow I have my own family and would never just drop by.  Because I have my own \"family home\" and not just a dorm or apt.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 they live in the bathroom very indecently \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "And get \"fitted\" for your recliner.  My parents went and a lady at the store helped them figure out which recliners for them properly (not the same one at all).  Recliners are made in different sizes to fit your leg and back length and it makes a huge difference.", "I'm 31 and really short so I love that our recliner has a cup holder because I hate having to nearly get up to get my drink off the side table\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Living. The. Dream.", "Ahhh a love seat! You get to share it with a person AND the items you love.", "i'm actually planning to get one soon that also has the vibrating massage. my adjustable bed already vibrates...why not the chair as well? haha \n\nbasically i want every surface i come in contact with to lull me into napping (not that i really need much assistance in that department)", "When I picked out my recliner I sat in a bunch of them and this one fit me like a glove, like perfect height of the arm rests and the headrest that was adjustable was at the right part of my neck, it was awesome! After we ordered it, my husband made a comment that he knew this was the one because my feet actually were on the floor instead of dangling, lol. I'm not even short, but I learned back in the day from an ergonomics person at work setting up my work station that my legs have more length in the thigh than in the calf, which makes me have to be able to adjust the seat forward in office chairs for proper support and also makes my chair need to be lower to the ground so my feet are on the floor, thus making my feet dangle when I sit in lots of \"standard\" furniture, lol."]}
