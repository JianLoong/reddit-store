She'd rather her family be comfortable than you *in your own home*. \n\nThe old saying is \"the squeaky wheel gets the oil.\" Her family is going to be loud about their opinions, it *is* going to cause problems, and since she's of the same mindset as them she might be inclined to give in or walk back boundaries.

You have a different set of social standards.\n\nAs a rule, part of the social contract of living together means compromise.
