That\u2019s such a basic, reasonable boundary. I\u2019m glad your partner supported you. If she starts to get anxious about push back just tell her that you love her and them, and they don\u2019t have to have the same perspective, but you deserve to be comfortable in your own home. And that they are welcome anytime you just want a heads up.", "Nta I dont really see why you wouldnt have discussed it with her previously instead of waiting till it happened again and freezing her mom out. Her family is being unreasonable causing friction though. It\u2019s totally reasonable to call or text ahead not just for you but why would they wanna show up at a bad time or when you\u2019re not even there.", "Nta it's healthy to have boundaries!", "Provisionally NTA (rather than N A H), based on her presumption that imposing this boundary will cause more problems than currently exist.\n\nYour fianc\u00e9e is agreeing to what you've asked, which is good. But she's also saying that this will cause friction with her family, completely failing to recognise that the *current* state of affairs is causing friction with you. She'd rather her family be comfortable than you *in your own home*. \n\nThe old saying is \"the squeaky wheel gets the oil.\" Her family is going to be loud about their opinions, it *is* going to cause problems, and since she's of the same mindset as them she might be inclined to give in or walk back boundaries. You need to keep on top of this. If they try to pull something, discuss it. If she doesn't agree, at least make her understand the consequences of their actions. Do you (or your relationship) want to be the wheel that fails with no warning?", "NAH, yet. SO and her family need to accept what worked for them doesn\u2019t work for everyone. So soon as one person (you or SO) is uncomfortable, the \u201cstatus quo\u201d needs to be revisited. Honestly, if her family have issue with calling or texting ahead when asked, they are the AHs", "Someone pitches up at my home at 8.30pm, without calling first, better be bleeding already, if not, they will be shortly........", "NAH. People have different expectations, your SO has open house, you want notice. I understand both sides, and I grew up in an open house. I would be uncomfortable with people turning up at 8.30 however, that's a bit late, and I might be half way down a bottle of wine and wifey would be in pjs... If you like your in laws, maybe err on the side of openness as your SO will appreciate it. Also, occasionally answer the door in your underwear, or pjs, so they get the idea that maybe texting is a good idea...", "NTA", "Just walk around naked where it\u2019s their bad fortune and they learn a lesson to not just show up unannounced. My family knows me well enough that they ALWAYS tell me when they are coming because they are scared what they\u2019ll walk into, it\u2019s great and I get an open door policy still.", "NTA I bet your SO will begin to appreciate those boundaries as well.", "NTA.", "NTA I will say my sister and I walk in and out of each other's house with no calls ahead, but we are both fine with that as is my partner of 7 years.

All major decisions, like an open house policy, need to have the agreement of both of you. You have a right to privacy.  Besides for most people it is considered common courtesy to ask before visiting someone, even (maybe especially) close family. If asking for a simple phone call or text  going to cause a rift between her and her family, then then there are major enmeshment issues between your SO and her family that need addressing.
