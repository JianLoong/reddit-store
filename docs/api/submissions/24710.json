When I asked what happened to the money he told us the above. I said no, and told him if he wants to go to school better get a job. My wife wants to pay it for his future, I said no we did right and he chose otherwise. AITA.\n\nEdit: We did inform him that the money was his to use. Be it for college or w/e. It was his money after all, we set it aside for him. We did explain the intent but he is an adult and he was free to use it as he pleases, just understand the consequences.\n\nEdit: 18 is an adult in my eyes, and old enough to understand actions have consequences. We informed him what the intent was for, and that we would not police him over it. End of the it was his money and he was free to use it he pleases sorry if I did not explain this properly before hand.\n\nEdit: My son knows what I do for a living. That said what I did was exactly what my dad. I also did not use it to go to school I used it as a down-payment on two houses and rented them out, and asked him for help.\n\nMy son was free to do the same. He may not have the knowledge or impulse control but he is told enough to know it is okay to ask for help if he is unsure how to use said money or had no idea what to do with his life.\n\nI am not a monster and he knows this. He could have just asked hey I want to travel how can I best go about that. Had he asked I would have let's do x y and z with your money then I would have given some money to travel.\n\nWe did the same with his car, he wanted a car we told him to save. When he saved up an amount needed to buy a car, I told him to keep at and we bought him a car. He knows I do not do think solely to be a cruel monster.\n\nHe had a bunch of options he choose the worse one, but I was not going to forcely interject my views on him if he did not want to come ask me for help.

It's fair to not want to pay for your son's college, it's fair of your wife to want to pay, and it's fair of your son to have used that money how he did. And it's fair of him to ask if you would. It's not fair of him to expect you to pay, tho. I guess I'd ask this: 1. Did his use of the money actually help him mature and figure out what he wants to do? Or did he just run out of money and decide to go to school just because? 2. If the latter, did you genuinely believe he was mature enough to handle that money? Because it isn't really his money unless it was in his name without any legal restrictions. It's your money to use on his college. 3. If it's the former, it sounds like his travels were really helpful and helped him get to a spot where he understands himself and what he wants out of life better. If you can afford it and think he's genuinely mature, I don't think this lesson you're teaching him will really be helpful for him. It'll put him in student loan debt or delay his schooling, which delays his career and earning potential.", "NTA", "NTA. If you laid out the options and he spent the money that\u2019s on him.

That's why they're not allowed to drink in the United States. That's why their car insurance is so high.

Any idiot could see it coming.", "YTA. You failed him as a parent. You didn\u2019t give him the information and guardrails he needed.

Or piss off and let your wife do it.", "YTA for handing that all over to an 18 year old and telling him he can do as he pleases with it.  You had to realize that was probably going to go badly.  And LO!  It has.  He is also TA for wasting the money, but he was 18.  You're an adult, you're supposed to know better.  18 may be legally an adult but let's not pretend that means a fully developed adult brain with good judgement.\n\nBut, ultimately, the question isn't who is TA here.  The question is what should you do now?  I guess you need to look at the possible outcomes:\n\n1. You don't help, and your son doesn't go to college because it's too expensive.  **This means your son won't go to college.**  That part in bold may seem stupidly obviously but consider all the implications of it, and decide if that's an outcome you want.  When you choose an action, you also choose the consequences of that action.\n2. You don't help, your son goes to college, but lives under crushing debt for so long that he most likely doesn't get a house, start a family, etc.  **All the things most parents want for their kids are delayed so late in life, you may not get to see them happen.**  For example, if he's your only child, this scenario greatly reduces the chances of you having grandkids. Student debt is a nigh-inescapable Hell that can put someone's life on hold forever.\n3. You do help, and it costs you a significant amount of money.  You're poorer than you would be otherwise, at least in terms of money.  You may also teach your son some financial irresponsibility here, he made a mistake and you're got to really hammer that home to him or he'll probably do it again.\n\nMy opinion is that he should suffer some consequences for screwing up.  He's got to learn, after all, or he won't have the maturity and wisdom to be a success.  But not going to college at all, or finishing with a lifetime of debt, kind of screws him over in terms of success anyway.  The lesson comes at too high a price.  That's not what you want.\n\nI'd suggest you help him out anyway.  Talk to him.  Offer some help, to make sure he goes to college even if he also has to take out some loans, then help him pay them off when he finishes.  Then you look like a hero at the end, who went above and beyond what you had to do.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppVpdsClN80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppVpdsClN80)", "YTA for expecting an 18 yr old to be responsible enough to make that decision and not change his mind as he matured.

If you had put dedicated effort into raising your son with a mature, nuanced understanding of finances and created an environment where he could explore that practically, yeah this would probably work. But based on the fact that giving your kid all of their savings in one go is such a lazy parenting move, I'm led to believe that you probably never bothered to take the time or care to teach that perspective to him. \n\nIf you are in the US, your kid's future is going to be riddled with debt for a huge portion of their adult life now because you gambled their college fund on them being mature enough to understand the gesture, and even though technically it's your son who piddled the money away on whatever, YTA for creating the circumstances that allowed him to do so.
