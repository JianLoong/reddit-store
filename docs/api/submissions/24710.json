When I asked what happened to the money he told us the above. I said no, and told him if he wants to go to school better get a job. My wife wants to pay it for his future, I said no we did right and he chose otherwise. AITA.\n\nEdit: We did inform him that the money was his to use. Be it for college or w/e. It was his money after all, we set it aside for him. We did explain the intent but he is an adult and he was free to use it as he pleases, just understand the consequences.\n\nEdit: 18 is an adult in my eyes, and old enough to understand actions have consequences. We informed him what the intent was for, and that we would not police him over it. End of the it was his money and he was free to use it he pleases sorry if I did not explain this properly before hand.\n\nEdit: My son knows what I do for a living. That said what I did was exactly what my dad. I also did not use it to go to school I used it as a down-payment on two houses and rented them out, and asked him for help.\n\nMy son was free to do the same. He may not have the knowledge or impulse control but he is told enough to know it is okay to ask for help if he is unsure how to use said money or had no idea what to do with his life.\n\nI am not a monster and he knows this. He could have just asked hey I want to travel how can I best go about that. Had he asked I would have let's do x y and z with your money then I would have given some money to travel.\n\nWe did the same with his car, he wanted a car we told him to save. When he saved up an amount needed to buy a car, I told him to keep at and we bought him a car. He knows I do not do think solely to be a cruel monster.\n\nHe had a bunch of options he choose the worse one, but I was not going to forcely interject my views on him if he did not want to come ask me for help.

He just decided to take the money and spend it on something else. I am not even sure what the discussion is about. He chose to invest the money in traveling rather than college. They are both a form of education. What would your wife say if he used the money for college to begin with and then came to you to finance his travels? It is the same scenario in my eyes.", "NTA.

It's fair to not want to pay for your son's college, it's fair of your wife to want to pay, and it's fair of your son to have used that money how he did. And it's fair of him to ask if you would. It's not fair of him to expect you to pay, tho. I guess I'd ask this: 1. Did his use of the money actually help him mature and figure out what he wants to do? Or did he just run out of money and decide to go to school just because? 2. If the latter, did you genuinely believe he was mature enough to handle that money? Because it isn't really his money unless it was in his name without any legal restrictions. It's your money to use on his college. 3. If it's the former, it sounds like his travels were really helpful and helped him get to a spot where he understands himself and what he wants out of life better. If you can afford it and think he's genuinely mature, I don't think this lesson you're teaching him will really be helpful for him. It'll put him in student loan debt or delay his schooling, which delays his career and earning potential.", "NTA", "NTA. If you laid out the options and he spent the money that\u2019s on him.

He spent it on something else and that was his choice. If he\u2019s serious about going to school he could come up with a game plan for what it\u2019ll cost and what he plans on studying. Maybe you could help him finance some of it if you\u2019re able?

That's why they're not allowed to drink in the United States. That's why their car insurance is so high.

Any idiot could see it coming.", "YTA. You failed him as a parent. You didn\u2019t give him the information and guardrails he needed.

Or piss off and let your wife do it.", "YTA for handing that all over to an 18 year old and telling him he can do as he pleases with it.  You had to realize that was probably going to go badly.  And LO!  It has.  He is also TA for wasting the money, but he was 18.  You're an adult, you're supposed to know better.  18 may be legally an adult but let's not pretend that means a fully developed adult brain with good judgement.\n\nBut, ultimately, the question isn't who is TA here.  The question is what should you do now?  I guess you need to look at the possible outcomes:\n\n1. You don't help, and your son doesn't go to college because it's too expensive.  **This means your son won't go to college.**  That part in bold may seem stupidly obviously but consider all the implications of it, and decide if that's an outcome you want.  When you choose an action, you also choose the consequences of that action.\n2. You don't help, your son goes to college, but lives under crushing debt for so long that he most likely doesn't get a house, start a family, etc.  **All the things most parents want for their kids are delayed so late in life, you may not get to see them happen.**  For example, if he's your only child, this scenario greatly reduces the chances of you having grandkids. Student debt is a nigh-inescapable Hell that can put someone's life on hold forever.\n3. You do help, and it costs you a significant amount of money.  You're poorer than you would be otherwise, at least in terms of money.  You may also teach your son some financial irresponsibility here, he made a mistake and you're got to really hammer that home to him or he'll probably do it again.\n\nMy opinion is that he should suffer some consequences for screwing up.  He's got to learn, after all, or he won't have the maturity and wisdom to be a success.  But not going to college at all, or finishing with a lifetime of debt, kind of screws him over in terms of success anyway.  The lesson comes at too high a price.  That's not what you want.\n\nI'd suggest you help him out anyway.  Talk to him.  Offer some help, to make sure he goes to college even if he also has to take out some loans, then help him pay them off when he finishes.  Then you look like a hero at the end, who went above and beyond what you had to do.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppVpdsClN80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppVpdsClN80)", "YTA for expecting an 18 yr old to be responsible enough to make that decision and not change his mind as he matured.

That\u2019s another option.", "I think this move (giving that money to your kid in one lump sum) works in some cases but not all and is really reliant on what kind of groundwork you laid in the last eighteen years. If you had put dedicated effort into raising your son with a mature, nuanced understanding of finances and created an environment where he could explore that practically, yeah this would probably work. But based on the fact that giving your kid all of their savings in one go is such a lazy parenting move, I'm led to believe that you probably never bothered to take the time or care to teach that perspective to him. \n\nIf you are in the US, your kid's future is going to be riddled with debt for a huge portion of their adult life now because you gambled their college fund on them being mature enough to understand the gesture, and even though technically it's your son who piddled the money away on whatever, YTA for creating the circumstances that allowed him to do so. Kids are a reflection of the continuous effort put in by the parents as much as they are their own personalities.

Obviously it\u2019s too late now, but you knew what was best for your child and ultimately now, so does he.", "My parents did the same thing at 19 when I was looking at either college or not going my dad went well here's the money you have saved up this will either pay for x number of years in school or whatever else you chose", "NTA, there are a thing called student loans, nothing is stopping him from going to college.", "NTA\n\nBut youre not very smart for giving an 18 year old that much money.", "NTA- why are so many of you saying he is not an adult at 18. If he commits a crime at 18 he is charged as an adult. At 18 you can be drafted to war and die for your country. So in the USA you are an adult at 18. OP you did nothing wrong you gave your child the tools to make good decisions and at the end of the day he is an adult and made the decisions for himself.", "YTA- it\u2019s ridiculous to expect a kid who has been handed what is likely high five or even six figures at one time to use it wisely. This idea that you don\u2019t offer advice because that\u2019s not how you do you is absolutely ridiculous when you are a parent.  I\u2019m in my 40s and my mom still has no shortage of (typically annoying) advice to give.  A lot of times I will just thank her for sharing and move on. \n\nIt is great that you were able to use your college fund to buy two houses, but that\u2019s not where we are in the 2020s- there\u2019s just no way anyone could have used a college fund in 2021 to buy two houses unless we are talking a college fund that fully covers tuition and living expenses for an expensive private school.  If that is how much you had, then it is even a bigger mistake to give it to him all at once as a lot of those schools run $75K+ a year with living expenses and tuition.  Even $75K income in one year is a lot for a person to make at 18. More than that- well it\u2019s no surprise he didn\u2019t spend it well. With 4 years of college expenses, you could likely live pretty lavishly traveling abroad for 2 years.", "NTA in the technical sense. You gave him information he needed. But 18yos are adults but all the idiocy of a child. They are not financially literate. So by not emphasizing the important of the funds and being loose with the rules, your child fell into a very easy trap when it comes to not knowing proper spending. Honestly, it comes off as potentially ruining a child's future for the sake of teaching a life lesson. Yeah, technically you did no wrong, but I think it's up to the parent to offer proper guidance while they're still developing. But again, technically you did nothing wrong. So you're not an asshole. Just be cautious that the relationship with your son may be strained in future because of a lack of faith that you are invested in their future. To him, it can come of as you don't care whether or not they succeed in life.", "NTA\n\nBut: if you can afford his tuition, you can make him an offer like this: he needs to find a job to fund his tuition. Based on his grades, you pay back part/whole of it (by semester or so)", "NTA.", "This is a tough one because some 18 year olds will be responsible and use it as intended. A lot will blow it like your son. It's a tough lesson for him and plenty of people take out loans. Hopefully this will make him more responsible in the future. He was kinda set up for failure because you seem to have expected he would blow it. NAH\n\nSide note: I have a 21 year old and even though he take care of his own bills and lives independently, I'm 100% he'd blow the money if we just handed it to him.", "NTA my parents didn\u2019t give me any money for anything I wanted to do.", "It shouldn\u2019t be a surprise when someone without a fully developed frontal lobe makes a bad financial decision. But you certainly don\u2019t have that excuse. I don\u2019t think your son is the only one at fault here. \n\nWhy would you give an 18 year old that\u2019s freshly graduated from high school thousands of dollars with no strings attached instead of just paying the school directly for tuition?", "NTA but this is also why I don't consider the money I save for my kids' college \"their money'.  I wouldn't let a kid squander like that. Gap years can happen after college.", "NTA. YWBTA if you paid for it.", "YTA I was going to say NTA until you said you would have given him money to travel, so what\u2019s the difference? He spent his college money on travel, let him spend his travel money on college.", "NTA for refusing to pay, but from your comments you really don't seem to care about him after your 18 years obligation is up. Sure, his money his choice to spend it all on useless junk, but you should have been observant enough to know that he would not have properly utilized it.", "NTA. Your son made a choice, and now he can see the consequences for the choice. That's the way of life.", "Looking at all the edits, I'm inclined to say YTA because you're unwilling to consider any other point of view. \n\nYou just *handed him* a bunch of money at 18. Even the most generous of trust funds don't let the recipient get unfettered access to all the funds at 18! Because the people who set up these funds don't think newly-fledged adults can be trusted with all that cash at that age. Instead, they get it when they're older, often paid out in three or four separate payments so if they blow the first chunk they still have the remainder waiting once they've learned their lesson.\n\nAnd you know, if people who regularly deal with very large sums of money think it's unwise to just hand off a large sum of money to an 18 year old, I think they're the ones who know best.", "YTA big time and I want to give the context why I feel that way. First, when I saw the title I\u2019ll fully admit I thought \u201cWhat could possibly go wrong here!?\u201d fully expecting to read along the lines of he blew the money on drugs, weed, hookers, booze, etc. But to my very pleasant surprise he used the money to travel and find himself. I feel that\u2019s a very acceptable use of the money. If you\u2019re very fortunate enough to be given the kind of money needed to travel when you\u2019re young it\u2019s something I encourage everyone to take that opportunity. I\u2019m sure some of those trips were once in a lifetime chances too. When you\u2019re young is the time to do that because by the time you get to your 40s, 50s the chance\u2026just won\u2019t be there anymore due to health or financial situation. I cannot blame him for taking the opportunity. Sometimes you really need those few years after high school to really find yourself and figure out what you want to do. Travel can give you that clarity. Really seeing the world and all the possible routes you can take in your life is often the best way to do that. I give him a hell of a lot of credit for taking those few years to do that instead of going to college right out of high school with no clue what he wanted to do and being unhappy. College is a big thing most will get only once, you have to, HAVE to be absolutely sure what you want to do before you go spending the cash on it. You said he could use it how he wanted, if you\u2019d rather he saved it for college later or used it right away for that you really should have explicitly stated that. He used it very appropriately to my great shock and surprise. We should all hope to be lucky enough to have had that chance to travel and find ourselves. He\u2019s got a very good head on his shoulders in a sea of young idiots and entitled people. \n\nHow you deal with this is up to you OP but I\u2019d give him a TON of credit for taking that time to travel and find himself. Most want to just jump right into college and party their asses off. Or they\u2019ll dash right to a huge shopping spree blowing that money fast. But he didn\u2019t, he figured out what he wants to do. You could ask him what he wants to go to college for first of all and see if it\u2019s a viable choice. If it is I really think you need to work this out with him. You could agree to pay for community college and if he wants to continue beyond that give him a portion of the tuition or make him pay for the rest of schooling. There\u2019s ways to make it work.\n\nOP,  I\u2019m normally a firm believer in actions have consequences both good and bad. If he\u2019d blown it all on frivolous shit I\u2019d be the first one to tell you your decision is the right one. He chose a good action in my mind though and feel there should be the positive consequence of still getting to go to college. I agree with your wife, you really should pay for all of it. I think his Mom recognizes he did good taking tha5 extra time to decide what he really wants to do. If you DO decide to cut him this huge slack make sure you express kindly in no uncertain terms this is it and this cash is going to be used strictly for college. Whatever you choose please AT LEAST praise him for taking that time to find himself and explore the world. Far too many either don\u2019t or can\u2019t. Without SOME kind of college he really is done before his life has really even started. Please reconsider this and actually reward him for recognizing he needed extra time to figure out what he wanted. There\u2019s times in life where you have to grant special exceptions and cut a break, I think this is one of those very few times where it\u2019s warranted.", "You bought two houses and rented them, thereby relying on someone else to finance your way through life, but are mad at your son for wanting the same?", "NTA \n\nHowever very short sighted.  \n\n> We did the same with his car, he wanted a car we told him to save. When he saved up an amount needed to buy a car, I told him to keep at and we bought him a car\n\nYou basically taught him that you'll take care of whatever it is and he doesn't have to actually earn it.  Just go through the motions.  \n\nYou meant well.  \n\nBut yeah he's in the same place most of us were.  Time for loans and a job.", "NTA.

I don\u2019t think we know enough about you to say that lol \nIdk I probably wouldn\u2019t have given an 18 yo fat stacks of cash 18 year olds are still kids \nBut I guess it just depends can you afford to pay for his schooling ? I think if you can afford it and there\u2019s something he\u2019s actually passionate about learning and commited to then yeah pay for it \nIf you cant afford it then you can\u2019t afford it in which case he could apply for grants n student aid", "NTA unless you knew this was going to happen", "Don\u2019t pay it he knew damn well what he was doing .

Yes, he should have asked for help, and yes, you fucked up here.", "YTA\n\nso you don't feel like you could've gone about this in a different way, at all? i see that you wanted to put that responsibility on him as an \"adult\" & let him make that decision alone. but you don't see how it may have benefited your child to have started teaching him the value of money and real life responsibility any other way? at minimum in a way that wouldn't have determined the trajectory of the rest of his life because of a choice made at 18 years old? \n\n\ni wont speak for others, but i know personally at 18 i was still looking to my dad for advice, guidance and learning real world skills to help me navigate through life. i'm just kind of lost on what your thought process was as you watched your son blow through his education and chance of having a better or even slightly easier future? as a father myself i just can't see myself taking this route. \n\n\ni want the best for my daughter, even if she ends up pissed off at me in a future situation where i refuse to let that money go towards anything other than her education, i\u2019d be able to sleep at night knowing chances are whatever temporary resentment she'd have would fade over time, and not continue to build overtime as she grows up & matures and realizes that if i had what was best for her in my heart she wouldn't have blown through her college fund as some weird, harmful, and unnecessarily manufactured life lesson. \n\n\ni just don't get it. we're supposed to protect our kids from their poor choices, especially as teenagers, if we can. idk, i'm rambling at this point but this is just such a shitty thing to do to your kid.", "I think before handing the money and saying do what you want with it ground rules should have been mentioned.

Like people who win millions ??", "This is all part of the financial literacy lesson. it's an excellent one to learn in early adulthood. When it's gone it's gone, the pain of that loss is a great lesson and opportunity to not make the same mistake again. There's no debt attached either.  Easier lesson to learn in early adulthood than later in life when bogged down with bigger responsibilities, and hard to teach this when kids are living at home rent free with an allowance.", "Yes.

Do whatever you want with it.\" Yeah, real good guidance.", "Because people are not born with financial responsibility. It also doesn't get magically injected in their brain at 18. Unfortunately, it's also not taught in many schools.

He magically because and adult at 18 and all the responsibilities he should have been taught will magically appear.", "If he was never taught financial literacy (a skill MANY adults struggle with for various reasons) it is not entirely on the freshly legal adult here. \n\nWe don't do what we aren't taught. \n\nYes, we have the internet but the internet and all this information is confusing for those that actually know how to research, let alone someone who has no actual guidance. Reading OP's responses, sounds like his wife tried to curb the habits but dear old dad just let his kid do whatever. \n\nIncredibly irresponsible on the part of OP. No wonder his kid did something like this. What did he expect to have happen?", "18 year olds are stupid, it's truly not his fault", "Okay, then that's that. It wasn't a great decision to give a kid a bunch of money, no guidance and no oversight.

Hopefully you're just as hands off in that instance as you were when your kid was traveling for years. \n\nESH.", "Ok, so you admit he didn\u2019t have the knowledge of money management, different choices he could make and the consequences of each of those. So you failed to teach your child a very difficult subject (because many, MANY people have poor money management skills, and don\u2019t KNOW how to ask for help). He may be 18 and legally an adult, but he\u2019s far from making the correct adult choices without guidance. \n\nNTA for choosing what to do with your money, but YTA for assuming and expecting he\u2019d know what to do or how to ask for help.

Did you help him go through options? And the consequences of each choice he could make? Sure, 18yo is legally an \u201cadult\u201d.

Money management is very difficult, especially if you weren\u2019t taught or guided in that direction. I say this all the time, there should be a financial management/taxes/home buying/job security/benefits/cc ownership class taught in all schools in the US.

This whole thing is just a mess of poor oversight and bad decisions.", "Sure in the eyes of the law, an 18 year old is old enough to vote and go off to war and die, but biologically his brain doesn't finish developing until his mid-20s. The prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that helps with decision making and understanding the consequences of one's actions, is the last part to develop. This is the reason that car insurance rates are higher for drivers under 25.  \n\n\nI am wondering why you and your wife did not provide financial literacy or guidance to your kid?   \n\n\nYou don't have to pay for the college, but you definitely quit parenting your kid when he needed you the most, even if none of you can admit it.", "Why were you against offering him guidance on how to effectively spend his money? \nBased on your attitude it almost seems like you wanted him to blow the money to teach him a lesson.", "You seem kinda indifferent as to whether your kid has a happy successful life....or dies alone broke in the gutter and are more focused on that you technically didn't do anything wrong.\n\nI don't think you stop magically being a parent once they hit their 18th birthday.\n\nKid is entitled and shit but some of that would fall on you and how your raised them.

An 18 year old makes incredibly stupid decisions as compared to a 35 year when they do it on their own (as opposed to with guidance from older people).  That was true for me.  However, people need to start making choices for themselves at some point in order to suffer consequences, gain experience, etc. and 18 is the somewhat arbitrary number for legal purposes.\n\nAre 18 year olds responsible in general?

I moved out two weeks before that date and have not relied on them for any help since.   Good decisions early set me up far better than my friends who \"had\" to go away for school and then move back home for a few years.

In that specific regard, it makes way more sense to me for someone to learn their limits drinking BEFORE they have the opportunity to drunk drive, but that starts getting into our lack of public transit and reliance on everyone owning a car.\n\nIt's all a disaster, because it's impossible for the law to individually judge people's maturity, so we set artificial dates that become these hard lines.

If you did, that seems like poor judgement on your part, especially if you didn't adequately prepare him on how to manage it properly. I think you need to take some responsibility for that. Perhaps a more responsible thing on your part would have been to give him a year's tuition each year.\n\nIs it reasonable to expect him to earn enough as a 20 year old with no real work experience or degree to pay for four years of college? When I went to school, my in-state tuition was about $2,000 per year. My eldest is about to start college and in-state tuition is about $25,000 per year. Fees and room and board and books add another $18,000. I was able to earn enough working side jobs in college to pay for my degree, and my parents helped me out with other expenses. It would be unrealistic to expect my kid to do the same today without graduating with a massive debt load.\n\nPeople with college degrees earn at least $1m more on average over their working lives than those without degrees (there are always exceptions, but these are the averages). The longer he delays getting a degree because he is working in a low wage job is very expensive over the course of his working life. If he's ready to go to college now, and you don't want to pay for it, maybe you could loan him the funds and he could pay you back over time. This would likely be much more affordable than taking out student loans, especially with today's interest rates. If you wanted, you could do something like you did with the car, and gift him the money once he's repaid it all.\n\nDoes he have to count your income when applying for financial aid? Most likely yes. If that's the case, you probably earn too much for him to get need based aid. That's not really his fault. I would think of his getting an education as an investment in his future. You can figure out a way for him to pay it forward if that makes sense to all of you.\n\nI would also urge you to come to an agreement with your wife. It is her money and her child too. You should be able to come to a resolution that you both can live with. That might mean agreeing to something that you wouldn't have done if you could make the decision yourself.

Instead he took 2 years to go have a life and explore and that\u2019s brought to where he is now, wanting to go to college and probably having a much better idea on what for and a much bigger chance to be successful at it. OP sounds pretty harsh and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if son eventually goes NC with that kind of tone", "Also, buying a house 20+ years ago was a liiiiiitle different...", "I wish this was the top voted comment, I do not see why this is so hard for people to see. The kid had every intention to crawl back to his parents for more money.", "I don't get why he would pay now. His kid made a choice and he can pay off the loans, every loan payment will be a reminder. Loads of kids go to college and have student debt well after graduation.", "This!!!! Honestly, I am a high school teacher, and if colleges gave out grants/scholarships for people other than seniors in HS. I would recommend that everyone takes a year or two off because most kids at 18 still don\u2019t know who they are or what they want to do career-wise!", "From previous posts it sounds like OP has a history of threatening to not give money, and then giving in and giving this kid everything he wants constantly. \n\nYou spoiled your kid and now your spoiled kid with no life skills is asking for money. What a shocker /s", "And then he says I would\u2019ve paid for him to travel anyway \ud83e\udd23 we get it, you\u2019re loaded and you\u2019ll fork over cash to the kid no matter what, and then be surprised when he expects you to fork over more cash", "Your post history says a lot about what kind of person you are", "You sound like a rich, overprivileged, narcissist asshole who set their kid up to fail and now wants to blame him for failing because your ego can\u2019t admit you parented him like shit. \n\nYTA", "You have no clue what the job market and economy are like these days.

It\u2019s such a huge disservice to the youth to think they\u2019re unable to weigh the pros and cons at that age, or even to ask help on how to manage the money.", "Same here, some people are saying OP is acting high and mighty because he hoped his son would have asked him for advice as to what to do with the money. I think OP is justified. If I were 18 and my dad gave me a lump sum that large and told me I could do whatever I want with it I wouldn't take that money and travel. I'd ask him what my choices were and how could I invest the money to make it grow. Even if I did blow all of it on travelling I certainly wouldn't go back and ask him to pay for my education. Maybe your son can ask for a personal loan from you while he pursues his education if the interest rates from the bank are too high?", "You have a good point.   With a large sum of money like that, one wonders how comfortable his life was growing up and if everything was just handed to him.  Maybe not, but who knows?  What I do know, is that getting that shitty job at 16 made me realize \"Yeah this sucks... I want to do better.\"", "They also were taught money management at ages 6, 10, 12 etc to prepare them.", "Is it not a valid assumption based on your previous relationship or did you disown him once he turned 18?\nBut honestly, this is some sort of dominance game with your son. He needs to ask for help before you intervene? (And I mean really intervene to change the outcome, not just let your wife do the blah-blah.) He did not ask, so you are letting him fail further so that he not asks but begs for help 10 years later, and you still get to make your point. Did you even want this kid or was it a burden all the way?\n\nDon't know how old you are, but advise you to check for senile changes in the brain and take action. There is something  in your reasoning that does not feel right.", "Hard to believe you work in financing and yourre this stupid. You don\u2019t hand a teen thousands of dollars and wait for them to come to you for guidance. You give them the education and guidance before handing over the money so they know how to save and budget.", "The voting age used to be 21 but the drinking age was 18.\n\nVoting age was first formally set by the Federal government at 21 right after the American Civil War. Then lowered to 18 during the 1970s because people were pissed that they could be drafted but not vote. Previous ideas of voting was that *established* men should be voters, not merely adult men. Men who were participants in society and might even have property, kids, spouse, etc (because women didn\u2019t have the right to vote universally until the 1920s). So, setting the age to vote past legal adulthood made sense. FWIW, we also have age requirements to be in Congress and to be President. \n\nThe drinking age swapped around the same time (1970s-ish) because several studies proved that 18-21 was the group most likely to drive drunk and just massacre themselves and everyone they came into contact with. The Fed gov\u2019t set it up that a state couldn\u2019t get federal funds for roads unless the state has a drinking age of 21. That was their solution to the \u201cyouth as road pizza\u201d problem. By the late 80s/early 90s all the states had given in for that sweet sweet road money.\n\nThe rent-a-car thing is an extrapolation of the drunk driving thing. 18-25 are the most likely to get into accidents and have the least amount of money, so rental companies have made the choice to discriminate against them as a cohort. Discrimination based on youth is not illegal in the US.\n\nSo, the drinking and car rental things don\u2019t stem from the idea that \u201coh their brains are underdeveloped\u201d.  No one honestly cared *why* young people are more likely to suck in these ways, we just wanted them to stop doing it.", "Where I\u2019m at in the states, if you are under 23 (I think, could be a year or two off the age) and living on your own, you are considered an \u201cunaccompanied youth\u201d and you can get quite a bit of assistance for that. I was offered it due to the fact that I wasn\u2019t living with my father, who had been my guardian previously, but I couldn\u2019t go back to school at the time.", "I don't think OP said anything about cutting him loose, just that he is not paying for 2 college funds when the first was used for something else.  I didn't get the feeling that OP's son has been throw  to the wolves, I'm sure if the son needed a place to stay or food he'd get it.  He just needs to pay for his own schooling which is fine, tons of people get no college funds.  Plus there is community college which AFAIK is not that expensive.", "Yeah, a lot of parents say, 'college for now. Get anything leftover at 25' for a reason, or free it up earlier for a home purchase, etc.\n\nThere's no real good reason to just... give a teenager 10's of thousands without restrictions. It's your money. Don't you want to see them do well, not waste it?\n\nThe only people I know who got trust funds all had it stepped, so idiot children don't blow generational wealth building in two years.

Or equivalent account, country depending. Many have tax advantaged accounts available to parents.", "He said he had his son save up for a car, and then told him to keep the money. Dad's got this one.\n\nHe wasn't exactly coming out of left field with, 'okay, now I want to go to college!'", "Yep! I made terrible financial decisions at 18. I tried, but it was the first time I'd had to manage my finances and money just seemed to disappear. OP should have done more to scaffold their son and teach him about money management, not just give him a lump sum and be done with it.", "I think the only people normalizing this are adults that didn't adequately explain long term consequences or those too well off to care.", "Where do you draw the line? At some point in your life, you have to learn about responsibility, consequences, and planning for your future. Enforcing that at a young age will have the best result. That's why 18 is where the line is. You've finished school and are ready to join society. If you don't start enforcing a mature perspective by then, that kid is going to be fucked for life", "Well at least he got college money. Many kids don't and still find a way to graduate. Besides college is not for everyone so would you say the same if he gave him money to travel and he choose to go to college? He spent the money the way tht was best for him at the time", "You would think \u201chere\u2019s your college fund\u201d is pretty clear on the guidance that it\u2019s for college \ud83d\ude02 you Americans baby adults too much. 18 is an adult in many countries - old enough to drive, drink and go to adult prison. Brains may not be fully developed but that\u2019s not an excuse. Above the age of 13/14 people are pretty intentional and in control of what\u2019s going on with their choices and lives.", "Right. And then some lottery winnings are annuities... Like you get 2 million a year for 50 years. So after they start spending the money and realize it doesn't go as far as they thought it does after taxes they find these JG Wentworth type of places to buy out there annuity and give them a lump sum for the rest of the money. Then they blow through that trying to live rich and wonder why they're totally broke in a few years.", "Looks like it's 24 now.  So for OP's kid, it gives him four years to save up some money but also qualify for his own aid.", "OP said they\u2019ve been \u201chands off.\u201d", "Assuming he's 20 now, he could work full time for 6 years and save up money for tuition, it's not like in 6 years he'd be starting with nothing.  And it's also not like the average person takes out massive loans for colleges, community college is not that expensive.", "What my ex-BIL did. My nephew saved up like 3k and dad said, 'Okay, let's look for cars up to 4k, you put in 2k and I'll cover up to the 4k+ tax and license and you save the rest for repairs.'", "Have you read the edits? OP pretty much set his son up for failure - he repeatedly reinforced that he would always be financially supportive, then withdrew that support for a fairly arbitrary reason.", "He also kind of set him with that secret \u201cI had the money for the car all along!\u201d mind game", "Younger even.

Literal kid.", "If other countries jumped off a bridge, would you do it too?", "Correction: It is 21 in the U.S. of today. Fifty years ago, 18 was the drinking age in many states. Here's what I remember about the change: Because the incidence of alcohol-related deaths was much higher in those under 21 compared to over 21, the age was changed. MADD was primarily responsible for this and other changes to cut down on deaths correlated with drinking.", "We did lower the age and it was a disaster.

Our parents were the custodians, but not every grandkid got the money. Because it was meant for college, my sibling didn\u2019t see any of the money due to not going to college.
