When I asked what happened to the money he told us the above. I said no, and told him if he wants to go to school better get a job. My wife wants to pay it for his future, I said no we did right and he chose otherwise. AITA.\n\nEdit: We did inform him that the money was his to use. Be it for college or w/e. It was his money after all, we set it aside for him. We did explain the intent but he is an adult and he was free to use it as he pleases, just understand the consequences.\n\nEdit: 18 is an adult in my eyes, and old enough to understand actions have consequences. We informed him what the intent was for, and that we would not police him over it. End of the it was his money and he was free to use it he pleases sorry if I did not explain this properly before hand.\n\nEdit: My son knows what I do for a living. That said what I did was exactly what my dad. I also did not use it to go to school I used it as a down-payment on two houses and rented them out, and asked him for help.\n\nMy son was free to do the same. He may not have the knowledge or impulse control but he is told enough to know it is okay to ask for help if he is unsure how to use said money or had no idea what to do with his life.\n\nI am not a monster and he knows this. He could have just asked hey I want to travel how can I best go about that. Had he asked I would have let's do x y and z with your money then I would have given some money to travel.\n\nWe did the same with his car, he wanted a car we told him to save. When he saved up an amount needed to buy a car, I told him to keep at and we bought him a car. He knows I do not do think solely to be a cruel monster.\n\nHe had a bunch of options he choose the worse one, but I was not going to forcely interject my views on him if he did not want to come ask me for help.

He just decided to take the money and spend it on something else. I am not even sure what the discussion is about. He chose to invest the money in traveling rather than college. They are both a form of education. What would your wife say if he used the money for college to begin with and then came to you to finance his travels? It is the same scenario in my eyes.", "NTA.

It's fair to not want to pay for your son's college, it's fair of your wife to want to pay, and it's fair of your son to have used that money how he did. And it's fair of him to ask if you would. It's not fair of him to expect you to pay, tho. I guess I'd ask this: 1. Did his use of the money actually help him mature and figure out what he wants to do? Or did he just run out of money and decide to go to school just because? 2. If the latter, did you genuinely believe he was mature enough to handle that money? Because it isn't really his money unless it was in his name without any legal restrictions. It's your money to use on his college. 3. If it's the former, it sounds like his travels were really helpful and helped him get to a spot where he understands himself and what he wants out of life better. If you can afford it and think he's genuinely mature, I don't think this lesson you're teaching him will really be helpful for him. It'll put him in student loan debt or delay his schooling, which delays his career and earning potential.", "NTA", "NTA. If you laid out the options and he spent the money that\u2019s on him.

He spent it on something else and that was his choice. If he\u2019s serious about going to school he could come up with a game plan for what it\u2019ll cost and what he plans on studying. Maybe you could help him finance some of it if you\u2019re able?

It could have conditions around university choice, major, repayment etc. I think if he picks a valuable major, with good prospects, and maintains high GPA and gets all the right internships, then if he took out loans and made it all happen you could give him the money after the fact as a graduation gift. Or you could make a trust and help him buy a house etc. \n\nIn the end, it's all his decisions, but if you want to get the best outcome for your kid there might be some ways to swizzle this situation.", "Ok so you told him to use the money however he wanted, which he did - did you specify it was meant for education purposes and his one shot to have you pay?

That's why they're not allowed to drink in the United States. That's why their car insurance is so high.

Any idiot could see it coming.", "YTA. You failed him as a parent. You didn\u2019t give him the information and guardrails he needed.

Or piss off and let your wife do it.", "YTA for handing that all over to an 18 year old and telling him he can do as he pleases with it.  You had to realize that was probably going to go badly.  And LO!  It has.  He is also TA for wasting the money, but he was 18.  You're an adult, you're supposed to know better.  18 may be legally an adult but let's not pretend that means a fully developed adult brain with good judgement.\n\nBut, ultimately, the question isn't who is TA here.  The question is what should you do now?  I guess you need to look at the possible outcomes:\n\n1. You don't help, and your son doesn't go to college because it's too expensive.  **This means your son won't go to college.**  That part in bold may seem stupidly obviously but consider all the implications of it, and decide if that's an outcome you want.  When you choose an action, you also choose the consequences of that action.\n2. You don't help, your son goes to college, but lives under crushing debt for so long that he most likely doesn't get a house, start a family, etc.  **All the things most parents want for their kids are delayed so late in life, you may not get to see them happen.**  For example, if he's your only child, this scenario greatly reduces the chances of you having grandkids. Student debt is a nigh-inescapable Hell that can put someone's life on hold forever.\n3. You do help, and it costs you a significant amount of money.  You're poorer than you would be otherwise, at least in terms of money.  You may also teach your son some financial irresponsibility here, he made a mistake and you're got to really hammer that home to him or he'll probably do it again.\n\nMy opinion is that he should suffer some consequences for screwing up.  He's got to learn, after all, or he won't have the maturity and wisdom to be a success.  But not going to college at all, or finishing with a lifetime of debt, kind of screws him over in terms of success anyway.  The lesson comes at too high a price.  That's not what you want.\n\nI'd suggest you help him out anyway.  Talk to him.  Offer some help, to make sure he goes to college even if he also has to take out some loans, then help him pay them off when he finishes.  Then you look like a hero at the end, who went above and beyond what you had to do.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppVpdsClN80](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppVpdsClN80)", "YTA for expecting an 18 yr old to be responsible enough to make that decision and not change his mind as he matured.

That\u2019s another option.", "I think this move (giving that money to your kid in one lump sum) works in some cases but not all and is really reliant on what kind of groundwork you laid in the last eighteen years. If you had put dedicated effort into raising your son with a mature, nuanced understanding of finances and created an environment where he could explore that practically, yeah this would probably work. But based on the fact that giving your kid all of their savings in one go is such a lazy parenting move, I'm led to believe that you probably never bothered to take the time or care to teach that perspective to him. \n\nIf you are in the US, your kid's future is going to be riddled with debt for a huge portion of their adult life now because you gambled their college fund on them being mature enough to understand the gesture, and even though technically it's your son who piddled the money away on whatever, YTA for creating the circumstances that allowed him to do so. Kids are a reflection of the continuous effort put in by the parents as much as they are their own personalities.

Obviously it\u2019s too late now, but you knew what was best for your child and ultimately now, so does he.", "My parents did the same thing at 19 when I was looking at either college or not going my dad went well here's the money you have saved up this will either pay for x number of years in school or whatever else you chose", "NTA, there are a thing called student loans, nothing is stopping him from going to college.", "NTA\n\nBut youre not very smart for giving an 18 year old that much money.", "NTA- why are so many of you saying he is not an adult at 18. If he commits a crime at 18 he is charged as an adult. At 18 you can be drafted to war and die for your country. So in the USA you are an adult at 18. OP you did nothing wrong you gave your child the tools to make good decisions and at the end of the day he is an adult and made the decisions for himself.", "YTA- it\u2019s ridiculous to expect a kid who has been handed what is likely high five or even six figures at one time to use it wisely. This idea that you don\u2019t offer advice because that\u2019s not how you do you is absolutely ridiculous when you are a parent.  I\u2019m in my 40s and my mom still has no shortage of (typically annoying) advice to give.  A lot of times I will just thank her for sharing and move on. \n\nIt is great that you were able to use your college fund to buy two houses, but that\u2019s not where we are in the 2020s- there\u2019s just no way anyone could have used a college fund in 2021 to buy two houses unless we are talking a college fund that fully covers tuition and living expenses for an expensive private school.  If that is how much you had, then it is even a bigger mistake to give it to him all at once as a lot of those schools run $75K+ a year with living expenses and tuition.  Even $75K income in one year is a lot for a person to make at 18. More than that- well it\u2019s no surprise he didn\u2019t spend it well. With 4 years of college expenses, you could likely live pretty lavishly traveling abroad for 2 years.", "NTA in the technical sense. You gave him information he needed. But 18yos are adults but all the idiocy of a child. They are not financially literate. So by not emphasizing the important of the funds and being loose with the rules, your child fell into a very easy trap when it comes to not knowing proper spending. Honestly, it comes off as potentially ruining a child's future for the sake of teaching a life lesson. Yeah, technically you did no wrong, but I think it's up to the parent to offer proper guidance while they're still developing. But again, technically you did nothing wrong. So you're not an asshole. Just be cautious that the relationship with your son may be strained in future because of a lack of faith that you are invested in their future. To him, it can come of as you don't care whether or not they succeed in life.", "NTA\n\nBut: if you can afford his tuition, you can make him an offer like this: he needs to find a job to fund his tuition. Based on his grades, you pay back part/whole of it (by semester or so)", "NTA.", "This is a tough one because some 18 year olds will be responsible and use it as intended. A lot will blow it like your son. It's a tough lesson for him and plenty of people take out loans. Hopefully this will make him more responsible in the future. He was kinda set up for failure because you seem to have expected he would blow it. NAH\n\nSide note: I have a 21 year old and even though he take care of his own bills and lives independently, I'm 100% he'd blow the money if we just handed it to him.", "NTA my parents didn\u2019t give me any money for anything I wanted to do.", "It shouldn\u2019t be a surprise when someone without a fully developed frontal lobe makes a bad financial decision. But you certainly don\u2019t have that excuse. I don\u2019t think your son is the only one at fault here. \n\nWhy would you give an 18 year old that\u2019s freshly graduated from high school thousands of dollars with no strings attached instead of just paying the school directly for tuition?", "NTA but this is also why I don't consider the money I save for my kids' college \"their money'.  I wouldn't let a kid squander like that. Gap years can happen after college.", "NTA. YWBTA if you paid for it.", "YTA I was going to say NTA until you said you would have given him money to travel, so what\u2019s the difference? He spent his college money on travel, let him spend his travel money on college.", "NTA for refusing to pay, but from your comments you really don't seem to care about him after your 18 years obligation is up. Sure, his money his choice to spend it all on useless junk, but you should have been observant enough to know that he would not have properly utilized it.", "NTA. Your son made a choice, and now he can see the consequences for the choice. That's the way of life.", "Looking at all the edits, I'm inclined to say YTA because you're unwilling to consider any other point of view. \n\nYou just *handed him* a bunch of money at 18. Even the most generous of trust funds don't let the recipient get unfettered access to all the funds at 18! Because the people who set up these funds don't think newly-fledged adults can be trusted with all that cash at that age. Instead, they get it when they're older, often paid out in three or four separate payments so if they blow the first chunk they still have the remainder waiting once they've learned their lesson.\n\nAnd you know, if people who regularly deal with very large sums of money think it's unwise to just hand off a large sum of money to an 18 year old, I think they're the ones who know best.", "YTA big time and I want to give the context why I feel that way. First, when I saw the title I\u2019ll fully admit I thought \u201cWhat could possibly go wrong here!?\u201d fully expecting to read along the lines of he blew the money on drugs, weed, hookers, booze, etc. But to my very pleasant surprise he used the money to travel and find himself. I feel that\u2019s a very acceptable use of the money. If you\u2019re very fortunate enough to be given the kind of money needed to travel when you\u2019re young it\u2019s something I encourage everyone to take that opportunity. I\u2019m sure some of those trips were once in a lifetime chances too. When you\u2019re young is the time to do that because by the time you get to your 40s, 50s the chance\u2026just won\u2019t be there anymore due to health or financial situation. I cannot blame him for taking the opportunity. Sometimes you really need those few years after high school to really find yourself and figure out what you want to do. Travel can give you that clarity. Really seeing the world and all the possible routes you can take in your life is often the best way to do that. I give him a hell of a lot of credit for taking those few years to do that instead of going to college right out of high school with no clue what he wanted to do and being unhappy. College is a big thing most will get only once, you have to, HAVE to be absolutely sure what you want to do before you go spending the cash on it. You said he could use it how he wanted, if you\u2019d rather he saved it for college later or used it right away for that you really should have explicitly stated that. He used it very appropriately to my great shock and surprise. We should all hope to be lucky enough to have had that chance to travel and find ourselves. He\u2019s got a very good head on his shoulders in a sea of young idiots and entitled people. \n\nHow you deal with this is up to you OP but I\u2019d give him a TON of credit for taking that time to travel and find himself. Most want to just jump right into college and party their asses off. Or they\u2019ll dash right to a huge shopping spree blowing that money fast. But he didn\u2019t, he figured out what he wants to do. You could ask him what he wants to go to college for first of all and see if it\u2019s a viable choice. If it is I really think you need to work this out with him. You could agree to pay for community college and if he wants to continue beyond that give him a portion of the tuition or make him pay for the rest of schooling. There\u2019s ways to make it work.\n\nOP,  I\u2019m normally a firm believer in actions have consequences both good and bad. If he\u2019d blown it all on frivolous shit I\u2019d be the first one to tell you your decision is the right one. He chose a good action in my mind though and feel there should be the positive consequence of still getting to go to college. I agree with your wife, you really should pay for all of it. I think his Mom recognizes he did good taking tha5 extra time to decide what he really wants to do. If you DO decide to cut him this huge slack make sure you express kindly in no uncertain terms this is it and this cash is going to be used strictly for college. Whatever you choose please AT LEAST praise him for taking that time to find himself and explore the world. Far too many either don\u2019t or can\u2019t. Without SOME kind of college he really is done before his life has really even started. Please reconsider this and actually reward him for recognizing he needed extra time to figure out what he wanted. There\u2019s times in life where you have to grant special exceptions and cut a break, I think this is one of those very few times where it\u2019s warranted.", "You bought two houses and rented them, thereby relying on someone else to finance your way through life, but are mad at your son for wanting the same?", "NTA \n\nHowever very short sighted.  \n\n> We did the same with his car, he wanted a car we told him to save. When he saved up an amount needed to buy a car, I told him to keep at and we bought him a car\n\nYou basically taught him that you'll take care of whatever it is and he doesn't have to actually earn it.  Just go through the motions.  \n\nYou meant well.  \n\nBut yeah he's in the same place most of us were.  Time for loans and a job.", "NTA.

I don\u2019t think we know enough about you to say that lol \nIdk I probably wouldn\u2019t have given an 18 yo fat stacks of cash 18 year olds are still kids \nBut I guess it just depends can you afford to pay for his schooling ? I think if you can afford it and there\u2019s something he\u2019s actually passionate about learning and commited to then yeah pay for it \nIf you cant afford it then you can\u2019t afford it in which case he could apply for grants n student aid", "NTA unless you knew this was going to happen", "Don\u2019t pay it he knew damn well what he was doing .

Yes, he should have asked for help, and yes, you fucked up here.", "YTA\n\nso you don't feel like you could've gone about this in a different way, at all? i see that you wanted to put that responsibility on him as an \"adult\" & let him make that decision alone. but you don't see how it may have benefited your child to have started teaching him the value of money and real life responsibility any other way? at minimum in a way that wouldn't have determined the trajectory of the rest of his life because of a choice made at 18 years old? \n\n\ni wont speak for others, but i know personally at 18 i was still looking to my dad for advice, guidance and learning real world skills to help me navigate through life. i'm just kind of lost on what your thought process was as you watched your son blow through his education and chance of having a better or even slightly easier future? as a father myself i just can't see myself taking this route. \n\n\ni want the best for my daughter, even if she ends up pissed off at me in a future situation where i refuse to let that money go towards anything other than her education, i\u2019d be able to sleep at night knowing chances are whatever temporary resentment she'd have would fade over time, and not continue to build overtime as she grows up & matures and realizes that if i had what was best for her in my heart she wouldn't have blown through her college fund as some weird, harmful, and unnecessarily manufactured life lesson. \n\n\ni just don't get it. we're supposed to protect our kids from their poor choices, especially as teenagers, if we can. idk, i'm rambling at this point but this is just such a shitty thing to do to your kid.", "I think before handing the money and saying do what you want with it ground rules should have been mentioned.

Like people who win millions ??", "This is all part of the financial literacy lesson. it's an excellent one to learn in early adulthood. When it's gone it's gone, the pain of that loss is a great lesson and opportunity to not make the same mistake again. There's no debt attached either.  Easier lesson to learn in early adulthood than later in life when bogged down with bigger responsibilities, and hard to teach this when kids are living at home rent free with an allowance.", "Yes.

Do whatever you want with it.\" Yeah, real good guidance.", "Because people are not born with financial responsibility. It also doesn't get magically injected in their brain at 18. Unfortunately, it's also not taught in many schools. So yeah, how much financial responsibility an 18 year old has will often come down largely to how much their parents taught them about managing money.", "Yes. He magically because and adult at 18 and all the responsibilities he should have been taught will magically appear.", "If he was never taught financial literacy (a skill MANY adults struggle with for various reasons) it is not entirely on the freshly legal adult here. \n\nWe don't do what we aren't taught. \n\nYes, we have the internet but the internet and all this information is confusing for those that actually know how to research, let alone someone who has no actual guidance. Reading OP's responses, sounds like his wife tried to curb the habits but dear old dad just let his kid do whatever. \n\nIncredibly irresponsible on the part of OP. No wonder his kid did something like this. What did he expect to have happen?", "18 year olds are stupid, it's truly not his fault", "Okay, then that's that. It wasn't a great decision to give a kid a bunch of money, no guidance and no oversight. But he knew that was it.\n\nThat said, his mother is not you and she can give him money or better yet, pay a school directly if she chooses to. Hopefully you're just as hands off in that instance as you were when your kid was traveling for years. \n\nESH.", "Ok, so you admit he didn\u2019t have the knowledge of money management, different choices he could make and the consequences of each of those. So you failed to teach your child a very difficult subject (because many, MANY people have poor money management skills, and don\u2019t KNOW how to ask for help). He may be 18 and legally an adult, but he\u2019s far from making the correct adult choices without guidance. \n\nNTA for choosing what to do with your money, but YTA for assuming and expecting he\u2019d know what to do or how to ask for help. This is something you start teaching at an early age. The worst time for such a lesson is when you give a high school graduate a substantial windfall.", "So you would have given him money to travel if he had spent the money on something you wanted? YTA let him spend the travel money on college like he spent the college money on travel. You sound very controlling. I\u2019m sure you never told him he could have travel money separately if he spent this on college, but if he didn\u2019t, you are cutting him off.", "But how did you prepare him for this amount of money? Did you help him go through options? And the consequences of each choice he could make? Sure, 18yo is legally an \u201cadult\u201d. But, most of the time, there\u2019s  no real life experience (or sometimes work experience) behind that age! Money management is very difficult, especially if you weren\u2019t taught or guided in that direction. I say this all the time, there should be a financial management/taxes/home buying/job security/benefits/cc ownership class taught in all schools in the US. So many parents fail to teach their kids these useful lessons because THEY didn\u2019t have the proper education in that subject.", "Jfc dude. He could stop a car on the street and find someone who would care more about his future than you seem to be.", "Who are you to stop him? I don\u2019t know \u2014- maybe his fucking father? Oh, wait. I forgot. You wiped that title out the day he turned 18. ESH, but mostly the literal adult who\u2019s been an adult for longer than a calendar year in this situation. \n\nYou kind of just suck.", "So to recap, you gave thousands of dollars to a teenager with no life experience and an underdeveloped prefrontal cortex, and you didn\u2019t put any limits on how he spent it. Seriously, dude, anyone could have seen that this wasn\u2019t gonna end well\u2014look how many professional athletes do the same thing on a much grander scale because they have tons of money and no one guiding them on how to use it.\n\nAlso: why didn\u2019t you put the money in a 529, if it was specifically earmarked for education? This whole thing is just a mess of poor oversight and bad decisions.", "Sure in the eyes of the law, an 18 year old is old enough to vote and go off to war and die, but biologically his brain doesn't finish developing until his mid-20s. The prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that helps with decision making and understanding the consequences of one's actions, is the last part to develop. This is the reason that car insurance rates are higher for drivers under 25.  \n\n\nI am wondering why you and your wife did not provide financial literacy or guidance to your kid?   \n\n\nYou don't have to pay for the college, but you definitely quit parenting your kid when he needed you the most, even if none of you can admit it.", "Why were you against offering him guidance on how to effectively spend his money? \nBased on your attitude it almost seems like you wanted him to blow the money to teach him a lesson.", "You seem kinda indifferent as to whether your kid has a happy successful life....or dies alone broke in the gutter and are more focused on that you technically didn't do anything wrong.\n\nI don't think you stop magically being a parent once they hit their 18th birthday.\n\nKid is entitled and shit but some of that would fall on you and how your raised them.

When he saved up an amount needed to buy a car, I told him to keep at and we bought him a car.\n\nIt\u2019s like you play a weird game of having super specific expectations - he is free to make his own choices but you have a secret preference for the correct way to do it and will reward him for reading your mind. \n\nFor example with the car - he made a choice and then you bought it for him anyway. You admit you would have given him money for travel. Sounds like he figured he could choose to travel and then you\u2019d pay for school anyway. \n\n>If you ask I will do all I can to help \n\nExcept - he asked and you said no.
