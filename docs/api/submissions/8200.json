My girlfriend (26) and I have been together 3 years and we plan to marry and we share a home.\n\nI\u2019m in the Air Force, and my specific job requires me to be pretty much unreachable from the rest of the world when I\u2019m on shift, and I\u2019m on shirt for 24 hours at a time. Because of this, my girlfriend unfortunately has to pass on some things come from me to my daughter. This is simply because I cannot be there to look after her.\n\nMy daughter has in the past year started to be a bit more rebellious. She\u2019s a teenage girl and we all know how they are so I\u2019m not overly concerned by it until she starts being more than an angst teen.\n\nPart of this is just refusing to do things like chores.

She said I shouldn\u2019t be having my\u00a0\u201cplaymate\u201d act like she\u2019s her mom. I felt like this isn\u2019t what was happening.

She shouldn't be saying those words, you need to figure out a better situation than a girlfriend being in charge of her, etc. I also fault you way way more than your daughter in this situation.", "ESH.\n\nWhy do you have split custody if you can\u2019t be there with your daughter a good portion of the time and are having someone else, someone your daughter doesn\u2019t even like, substitute as a parent?\n\nYour daughter crossed a line by calling her that, but I think you need to consider how to be a more involved parent. Your girlfriend parenting your 16 year old isn\u2019t working for anyone.

You need a new system, or your daughter is going to cut you off.", "EH.   ESH.   You're dating someone who's closer in age to your daughter than you, which makes you pretty gross by default.   And then you left your daughter with this person.      \n\n\nYour daughter's behavior was not acceptable (the chores) and the language was appalling and she SHOULD be punished for it, but frankly, how can you expect her to act like an adult when you're acting like a gross teenager yourself?", "YTA.

It seems like the GF was trying to act on behalf of the dad, not making her own decisions. \n\nBeing the stepparent or parents partner does often mean doing things for a kid with no say in how they are raised. That's what you sign up for. But a minimal level of courtesy should be expected.\n\nSo ESH. Does the daughter expect to be able to openly break her father's rules while he's working?\n\nIf I were the GF I'd tell the daughter that, as long as her dad-defined responsibilities were met by the time he got home, and as long as where she was going was allowed, I wasn't going to play hall monitor.

I really hope you see that this is part of a much larger issue. Children don\u2019t get to dictate their parents dating lives, but you could definitely lose your daughter if you aren\u2019t careful here. Are you sure her rebellious phase has nothing to do with your relationship? If I were your daughter, what I would see is that I\u2019m losing my dad to someone close to my age who doesn\u2019t like me.

What do all of you want the relationship between them to be? Are they basically roommates, or do you expect your girlfriend to act as an authority figure?\n\nIf it\u2019s the latter, it\u2019s no surprise that your daughter isn\u2019t receptive.

While it would've been fair for her to remind your daughter of the usual policies, forbidding her from going out is a bridge too far.\n\nWhile it was completely reasonable for you to enforce consequences, you should've taken steps to avoid the situation altogether.

Like I can even imagine your daughter at a 13 year old meeting this 23 year old and having a thought that this young person might be a step parent. \n\nOh boy she\u2019s gonna definitely rebel if when you guys get married. I just know she will. I wouldn\u2019t take someone 10 years older than me seriously if they tried to be a parent to me at that age.\n\nAlso that punishment is too much. Taking her keys away? What is this? forcing her to be around your 26 year old gf? \n\nShe should have more time with her mother if you\u2019re going to just make her stay with the 26 year old. \n\nAnd lmao at the comment of \u201cshouldn\u2019t be having your playmates act like she is her mom\u201d I physically laughed.

You need to tell her what the consequences will be if she doesn't do what you ask of her, and you need to be fully present when you're not working.", "YTA, but I feel like I can provide some valuable insight to remedy this? \n\nI kinda can put myself in your daughters shoes as I interestingly also have an AF dad, parents who divorced when I was 6, and a stepmom with the same age difference. If you want a relationship with your daughter, you do need to set boundaries. Try putting yourself in her shoes, understanding what it\u2019s like to be in her shoes. \nI am SO thankful my parents divorced and LOVE my stepparents more than anything, but it seems you are neglecting to acknowledge your daughters feelings. \n\nThe conflict with your ex is exactly what occurred between my parents. I felt very hurt and rejected by both my dad and stepmom when she took on the role of a disciplinary figure. Your child has two parents and it\u2019s truly not the place of your (or your exes)  new partner to discipline your kid. I was half the age of your daughter when this happened and I still remember these situations vividly. My stepmom communicated her regret for hurting me and ensured she wanted me to feel safe and loved. This absolutely laid the groundwork for our close relationship. \n\nConsider constantly switching between environments. This is emotionally taxing, especially for a teenager who is still learning and growing, and you\u2019re ignoring the extra load of responsibility this places on her. While chores help provide structure and responsibility, it seems the setup you have now lacks flexibility and communication. Leaving orders on notes is bound to make a teen or really anyone feel rejected and angry. Be supportive and communicate. Do not enforce chores as punishment. This doesn\u2019t set her up to manage responsibility of living alone in the future, just creates an unhealthy relationship with chores.\n\nMy guess for cause of tension in your relationship with your daughter and her resulting behavior is her feelings of rejection. My mom always reiterated that my sister and I were her number one priority and she would never be with a man who we didn\u2019t want in our lives. I\u2019m not saying your daughter at 16 needs to pick a woman out for you herself but, you need to recognize your responsibility as her father to prioritize and emotionally support her. You may really love your girlfriend and want to nurture that relationship for it to last, but this can\u2019t be at the expense of yours with your daughter. My dad grew to take my stepmoms side on things to avoid conflict (as the power dynamic between you and your kid allows you the ability to shut resulting conflict with her down) and this at times pushed me away, especially when I needed love and support from my dad. \n\nThis is not meant to be the longest boohoo trauma dump ever, because I have worked through these things and have strengthened relationships with my parents, self, and etc.. This just feels like too eerily similar to my childhood to not provide some potential insight to your daughters feelings, as I would seriously hope for you to really consider the advice you receive and have the strongest healthiest relationship with your daughter you can.", "NTA, your flatmate was explaining the house rules to your non income earning dependent and got sworn at for it. If the dependent doesn't like the rules then consider a custody agreement where they spend more time at the mothers.\n\nIf they can't abide the rules then something needs to change. It's not about respecting authority because your daughter has no respect already. It is about enforcing consequences.\n \nCan you and your partner move further away? How much does a healthy relationship with your daughter matter to you? Because if this was someone only related to me by blood, neglect would be the result of that disrespect.
