My daughter has always been a picky eater and we have always done our best to accommodate her (Feeding her before parties weddings etc ). The problem lies with my husband's upcoming birthday ( turning 50).\n\nThe restaurant he has picked is very special to us. That is where we first met as children for a business deal our parents had and then we became best friends when he asked me out in that very restaurant and our first date was there. When he proposed to me and who catered our wedding, I told him I was pregnant and we held my daughter's 1st birthday there. Unfortunately, we couldn\u2019t go there a lot as we had to move for his job but basically, all the major events of our lives were held there. So for my husband's birthday to celebrate him turning half a century old, we want to go there.\n\nWe once took our daughter there when she was 10 and she hated it. But now since she is 16 I thought she would have matured enough and it is not like I'm forcing her to eat. She has the option of eating at home and I've told her so many times that the restaurant does have food she likes to eat, but she claims that it smells bad. It is a seafood restaurant but we always sit outside at our usual table so I don\u2019t understand that.\n\nShe says that we are being selfish but I told her it's not about her it's not her day. In anger, she has refused to talk to us and not doing her usual chores and is refusing to eat. My husband is heartbroken and thinks it is all his fault and wants to cancel but I think it will just fuel her brattiness. Today my husband had to work late so it was only my daughter and me. When I called for my daughter to come to eat she looked at the food and then took the plate and dumped it in the bin.\n\nI was shocked, food is valuable and she didn\u2019t have to do that. I snapped at her calling her a selfish insecure little brat. That she is not only hurting her father but ruining his birthday and it's not as if we are asking her to give up a kidney. That if she continues this behavior we will never fund her birthday parties ever again. She said that I am a terrible mother for saying that.\n\nI feel like i went overboard but that she is acting like a brat.

Daughter is 16, old enough to know better! Yesterday Reddit criticized a mother for always catering to her picky eater, and making sure wherever they go kid likes the food. Now Reddit is calling OP and AH for telling her daughter NO, it\u2019s not about her. This girl threw food away just because, instead of saying \u201cno thank you, not hungry\u201d how is this ok?! \nThe only thing OP is to blame for, is for letting her daughter be so entitled, thinking it has to be where she wants! Because she\u2019s a picky eater. It\u2019s her dads birthday! That restaurant is special to him.", "You are NTA but your daughter certainly is.  Please don't cater to her as you're right, it will fuel things.  If she can't get over herself for a special dinner with her dad, why not leave her at home as she will probably just cause unnecessary drama.\n\nShe seriously needs to grow up an learn that the world doesn't revolve around her.  If she doesn't learn it now the world will teach her and it won't be a nice lesson.", "NTA.  She is  a brat - all you did was point out the obvious.  Have the dinner, and have a nice evening.  Leave her at home then.  You have been accommodating her for long enough - she is 16 - old enough that if she wants to be 'that' person in any group, then she will have to either figure out how to deal with it, or be prepared to have no friends, or friends that just don't invite her to anything.  She will not be able to control where and what everyone else eats - and anyone who lets her do it, won't be around long.  \n\nTake this from someone who has been a lifelong 'picky' eater - I always figure it out, but I don't try to enforce it on others.  I haven't yet been anywhere that I can't find something on the menu, or that I haven't been able to call ahead and ask if they mind leaving out something from a dish (some of my things are specific ingredients).  Even if I just eat bread, I can still go and have fun with my husband and my friends.  They know me - and they don't draw attention to it - and I don't either.\n\nIts one night, the place has a lot of special meaning to you, and you should go.  She will need to learn how to put up with herself if she wants others to put up with her.", "NTA. You called her out on how she was behaving. Now if you berate her continuously it would change. But to shock her with harsh words is needed as a teenager sometimes. She's not a wilting lilly. And she's old enough to know how she's acting is wrong. She can legally drive (in the US) and almost old enough to vote and join the army. She can handle being called out. \n\nNow help her with positivity on improving going forward. If she refuses to get past herself for her father's special day leave her behind when you go there. She is old enough to travel and then stay at the room for dinner. That will be better than a teenage tantrum at dinner.", "I dunno.  As a parent I would have been pissed, and it's easy to say things when you're pissed that you might have held back on otherwise.\n\nHowever, your daughter is behaving really, really badly.\n\nSo give her a choice.  Either she goes to the dinner and behaves (eating not required) or she stays home - with a babysitter.\n\nNTA for your choices, a bit of an asshole for screaming at the kid (but most of us would at that point).\n\nI had three daughters and thank GOD they are all grown because teenage girls can be hell.\n\nEdited to say:  I have an autistic daughter and this is still unacceptable behavior, please don't blame it on autism.", "NTA. I was a bratty 16 year old girl not that long ago, and sometimes we\u2019re jerks and need to be told that we\u2019re being jerks! Like you said, you\u2019re not forcing her to eat there, just reinforcing that this is a special event and not about her. She threw way too big of a temper tantrum for what she was actually being asked to do and you called her out on it.", "On reading the title, I was expecting to come down against you. But on reading the story, I really can\u2019t. She is a brat. Good on you for telling her as much. Stay firm. NTA.\n\nHowever don\u2019t bring her to this place. She will ruin the experience. Make her do something unpleasant instead like community service or chores for a relative.", "NTA. I almost went ESH, but sometimes kids need to hear things the harsh way. Your daughter might benefit from occupational therapy. Her picky eating could easily be a sensory disorder and therapy can help with that.", "Be prepared:  the teens of Reddit are going to say YTA.  But seriously, that behavior she is exhibiting is entitled and bratty.  You called her out on it.  NTA", "NTA. She needs better discipline from you. To be clear, not for the picky eating, she probably can't help that, but for the behavior.", "NTA. She is a selfish insecure brat and she needed to hear it. Leave her at home. Go celebrate your husband's birthday together and leave the brat behind. I would have gotten smacked into the next century if I acted like that", "NTA\n\nYour child needs therapy, and possibly medical diagnosis.   None of that's normal behavior as a teenager.      \n\nYou've (as a couple) spoiled your child for 16 years and here are the consequences.", "NTA she's 16 and she knows better", "NTA 16 is way too old to be acting like this and I also agree throwing away a plate of food is incredibly wasteful and immature.", "NTA - she was throwing a tantrum to the point that her dad wanted to cancel something he wanted for his birthday. You made the right move. She needed to be called out", "NTA\n\nHowever, there is more to being a 'picky' eater, I think. My Grandchild is autistic and has food issues and goes to 'food therapy' and its really helped. (they keep a stock of 'safe foods' for the child)\n\nThe behavior on the other hand is not acceptable. Dumping food you made into the bin in a strop is not ok and needs to be dealt with. Not by threats but rather telling her that since she doesnt like what you prepare for her, then she can prepare her own meals (and cleaning up after herself is required also --- she cant cook herself something and leave a mess for someone else to clean up).\n\nAs for the birthday party, leave her home. Either get a babysitter or if youre comfortable with her being home alone, then do that. If she cant behave then she cant go.\n\nBut threatening to never give her a birthday party again isnt the right way to handle this, the 'punishment' needs to be in relation to the actual event. \n\nApart from that, therapy might be something to consider.", "NTA why would you ask a website full of children/adults-with-child-mindsets? Your daughter sounds awful.", "NTA but your daughter needs therapy", "The only part of this that bothers me is your labeling her a \"brat\" and \"insecure\". It would have been better to describe her behavior instead. Despite that, I still lean toward NTA. Having a teen is tough and you got triggered. You certainly have room for improvement, but her tossing the food in the bin was clearly meant to trigger you. You were right on both. You went overboard and she is behaving unreasonably.", "ESH You realize you've cultivated this behaviour in her, don't you? She's old enough to manage her food herself.  She doesn't need to attend the birthday dinner. After all, it's not about her or what she likes or doesn't like.", "Wow she is a little pill. She is totally pushing her boundaries to see how/if you will do anything about her behavior.", "NTA. And you are allowed to even go a bit further.\nWhat a brat. Please fix her now before you release her into the real world when she is an adult omg. (I say this in the most politest way ever!)", "NTA. Your daughter sounds like a spoiled adolescent, and you blowing a gasket was probably a good thing. The threats to withhold future birthday celebrations may have been a bit overboard. As for your husband's birthday, I'd suggest you leave her at home unless you want a scene.", "ESH she is behaving badly but basically you have taught her that she can. Your response was awful. Your husband enables her bad behavior as well. Of course she behaves this way, you\u2019ve always allowed it! You don\u2019t make her get along in situations she doesn\u2019t like, you don\u2019t teach her to find a way to politely get through it, you give her an alternative and allow her to complain about the rest. \n\nI really think her behavior is mostly the fault of bad parenting. I mean your husband wants to cancel his whole party because she is unhappy.", "NTA!", "I'd leave her home that day.\nI feel she'll make a scene to ruin it.", "ESH - This is hard to judge - your daughter at 16 should normally be expected to behave appropriately \n\nBut I doubt this behavior just popped up out of nowhere.", "NTA rules for life, leave spoiled brats and unfriendly, unsociable dogs at home. \n\nProblem solved.", "NTA - you raised a brat", "ESH\nFirst off, outside of the name calling, you are right. And at 16, I'd say leave her at home. \nThe fact that you allowed this, without finding out if there's an underlying issue (autism or other mental health issues) brings you here. \n\nIt's his birthday.

Celebrate as a family during the day, then have a nice romantic night out, just the two of you, which is what makes sense given the restaurant's significance. It was also shitty to threaten that you would never have another birthday party for your kid. Making empty threats like that is a sign that you feel out of control and are trying to reassert yourself, which isn't conducive to a productive conversation with your kid.", "YTA.

Yeah, you could have just said you\u2019re acting like a brat, no instead you added two names to that, you\u2019re not a mean girl in high school, you\u2019re a mother.

My daughter has always been a picky eater and we have always done our best to accommodate her (Feeding her before parties weddings etc ). The problem lies with my husband's upcoming birthday ( turning 50).\n\nThe restaurant he has picked is very special to us. That is where we first met as children for a business deal our parents had and then we became best friends when he asked me out in that very restaurant and our first date was there. When he proposed to me and who catered our wedding, I told him I was pregnant and we held my daughter's 1st birthday there. Unfortunately, we couldn\u2019t go there a lot as we had to move for his job but basically, all the major events of our lives were held there. So for my husband's birthday to celebrate him turning half a century old, we want to go there.\n\nWe once took our daughter there when she was 10 and she hated it. But now since she is 16 I thought she would have matured enough and it is not like I'm forcing her to eat. She has the option of eating at home and I've told her so many times that the restaurant does have food she likes to eat, but she claims that it smells bad. It is a seafood restaurant but we always sit outside at our usual table so I don\u2019t understand that.\n\nShe says that we are being selfish but I told her it's not about her it's not her day. In anger, she has refused to talk to us and not doing her usual chores and is refusing to eat. My husband is heartbroken and thinks it is all his fault and wants to cancel but I think it will just fuel her brattiness. Today my husband had to work late so it was only my daughter and me. When I called for my daughter to come to eat she looked at the food and then took the plate and dumped it in the bin.\n\nI was shocked, food is valuable and she didn\u2019t have to do that. I snapped at her calling her a selfish insecure little brat. That she is not only hurting her father but ruining his birthday and it's not as if we are asking her to give up a kidney. That if she continues this behavior we will never fund her birthday parties ever again. She said that I am a terrible mother for saying that.\n\nI feel like i went overboard but that she is acting like a brat. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Is that going to make him happier?", "I just do not see how his daughter sitting there in a place she does not want to be makes him happier.", "I didn't say he should not go, if he likes the smelly fish restaurant go and have a blast.\n\nHe should just realize that not everyone else shares his preferences.\n\nI don't see how his daughter, sitting there being miserable for 2 hours is going to make his party better in any way.", "Me too.

Texture, smell, taste, etc was just not something the could handle. Many learned to wolf food down without tasting (and frequently struggle with obesity as a result), many developed eating disorders, and some overcame it. It's the same story with certain stomach disorders and food allergies. Not all food allergies are to the point of swelling faces and vomiting. Many people who discover they are allergic to things like dairy, onions, peppers, etc later in life never knew what caused their stomach to hurt, they just knew it did constantly.\n\n It could just be pickiness, but there is a host of other things it could be. The fact that OP says this has been a lifelong issue is the concern. Most kids who are truly just picky as toddlers will eventually expand their tastes as they get older. The fact that it's gone 16 years with no changes in the level of food aversion is the issue here.", "seafood intolerance.

I\u2019m sorry for what you went through as a child but not everyone\u2019s parents are like this.\n\nMy brother was so picky as a child by mum had to peel the skin off of cooked sausages, and jacket potatoes.

I'm not even saying ASD is the most likely culprit, as it could be literally dozens of things from food allergies to ADHD to Bulimia to a stomach disorder. But to have the same struggles with food for 16 years and to never even look at taking her to the doctor? That's bad parenting.
