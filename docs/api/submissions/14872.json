Like, in relationships people do little favors for each other (like wrapping up their companion's leftovers, which it sounds like he asked you to do because he was still eating and you were done) so I think you're kind of dying on a weird hill by refusing to do that for him, but his reaction is also waaaaaaaaay out of line.\n\nDo you guys fight about other stuff like this?", "When you don\u2019t got much goin on in your life so you have to create your own drama.", "I want to understand this situation. So you were not hungry for a full meal, only a side dish. But it makes economic sense to just get a whole meal and save the main portion for leftovers. Because you wouldn\u2019t have wanted the main portion, he ordered it the way he liked it to eat later. You finished eating. He was still eating. He asked you if you could box up his food while you were just sitting there. You refused. \n\nA lot of people calling him controlling, but it honestly just sounds like both of you are petty af.\n\nYou know how this situation would have played out in a healthy relationship? My partner wouldn\u2019t even have to ask me to put their leftovers away because if my hands weren\u2019t busy, I just would. They probably wouldn\u2019t ask me to, because it wouldn\u2019t bother them if I didn\u2019t do it for them, though. But if they did ask me to, I would do it right away. But if I refused, they would let it go. But if they didn\u2019t let it go, it wouldn\u2019t turn into an argument, just a \u201cHey, are you ok?\u201d \n\nThere were so many points that either of you could have acted like a reasonable adult but neither of you did. Don\u2019t you like doing small favors for your partner?\n\nESH", "I might have to go against the grain here, and say ESH. Because of your comment:\n\n>His reasoning was because he was finishing eating, so his hands were full, but mine weren't cause I was done eating.\n\nIt sounds like he was busy eating and just asked you to pack it up for him.\n\n>He initially said, \"Can you put that away?\" Came off as a demand to me.\n\nThis doesn't sound like a demand to me at all. Was it because of his tone? What am I missing here? \n\nEveryone seems to want to jump to abusive controlling man, but the two examples you have given really don't come off as that demanding. And it seems like your refusal may be what starts the arguments. But I'm still going ESH, because he's an AH for fighting about your refusal. You're both fighting about really minor things.\n\nHim requesting a drink if you're up, and asking you to pack up food while he's still chomping away on his breakfast don't sound like demands, or attempts to make you his subservient. At least not to me. But there may be missing information about the frequency of the requests (your post and comments make it seem like there were two occasions). \n\nPerhaps your personal styles just don't match. You don't want to ask for help, he does. Maybe you need to be with people who like each other's style.", "YTA - It's not that big of a deal.

He then, after basically making you just sit there and watch him eat while you had a small side dish, insisted you pack up his leftovers, which again, you didn't even touch, and neither did he, so honestly that's more than likely just a weird goddamn power move, since apperantly no one in the table wanted to eat it.\n\nI'm not saying he's definitely a misogynist, but so many previously normal dudes have fallen down that rabbit hole the last couple of years, either through podcasts, YouTube or Reddit.
