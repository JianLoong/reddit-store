Me and my best friend have been extremely close ever since we were twelve and other than my wife he is the person I trust and respect the most in the world. Me and my best friend currently work together in running a company that we started in our early twenties together and have been pretty successful and in the many years we've known each other he's always stepped up when i needed him. For example he learnt how to cook for the first time in his life so that he could make dinner for us when we were struggling with raising a new born. \n\nWhile I don't have any family by blood my wife has a sister and 3 nieces.So the other day me and my wife got a bit tipsy together and wandered onto the topic of wills and i casually said if we both died tomorrow id be pretty comfortable knowing my assets would be managed by my friend and given to our daughter once he turned 18. This prompted my wife to inquire about who I wanted our daughter to go to. I thought it was pretty obvious that i expected in case of a worst case scenario that our daughter would got to my best friend. \n\nHowever my wife claimed that would be wildly irresponsible handing over our daughter to someone who has no experience with children. She told me that she would rather our daughter go to her sister cause they are family and already have children so it would be a safe bet.I was totally against this because I don't believe that blood is the be all end all in relationships or trust and don't think they would be fit to add a extra child to their family.

What is important to remember is that what you and your wife want (in the case of an unfortunate event happening)- has to also be wanted by the person whom your child would go to if such an incident is to happen. Your friend or her sister may not want to take on that responsibility. One may want to take on the role while the other doesn't. This is why it is important to have clear communication and for everyone to be on the same page. \n\nOne thing you can remind your wife of is that everyone is childfree in life until some aren't. Having a blood bond doesn't mean things are better or will be better. \n\nNAH", "INFO: Why do you think your SIL is unfit to be your child\u2019s guardian?", "You haven't said what your friend thinks about this or what his wife is like.  Big commitment for a non family member.  Remember he is your best friend not your daughters.   Being part of a family with your cousins would be less traumatic than living with someone who has no kids.   This is not about you , this is about your daughter.   \n\nI am also wondering how your friend will manage your assets?  Not sure if you have fully thought this through.   Definitely something you need to have a detailed conversation with your wife with and once you have agreement ensure the other party agrees and have a very good will drawn up.  Remember your wife has as much say as you.", "\"Would be wildly irresponsible to hand over our daughter to someone without any experience with children\".\n\nHow much experience with children did OP and their partner have when the hospital handed them their child when they left, I wonder? \n\nThere's never any guarantee that someone else will treat your child well should they become a guardian. I would think that whomever your daughter is most comfortable with would be the ideal choice. How much time does she spend around the BF compared to the aunt? Does the aunt  live in the same city? Would the child be uprooted from her surroundings that she is familiar with?\n\nI would really put some thought in this. Does the BF even want the responsibility?", "I am going to say NAH with some advice.  Relationships are difficult enough, I suggest you not argue about a low probability hypothetical situation.  The odds of you both dying at the same time are low.  You have to decide this at some point, but it should be done calmly in conjunction with an estate plan.  And your wills can be different.", "INFO: Who would your daughter rather live with? Her aunt, uncle, and three cousins, or your single male friend?", "INFO\n\nWould your best friend be willing to take your daughter in if you and your wife died or were otherwise incapacitated?", "NAH, the biggest thing is if this is a concern or topic that is carried further than one drunk night, then a conversation needs to be had with both SIL and the best friend. He may not want the responsibility of a child or she may have the same concerns you do in terms of time and finances. Assumptions are being made here on both your guys part.", "NAH. \n\nYou both love these people and have valid reasons for choosing them. Neither of you is wrong.", "ESH. You have a seven year old and the first time either of you thought to have this conversation was drunk, 7 years later than you should. It\u2019s good you\u2019re talking about this now, because it\u2019s irresponsible that you don\u2019t already have a plan. \n\nAs for the debate, I can completely understand why your wife would rather leave your child with a family, rather than with a single guy whole entire life would be fundamentally altered by having to take care of a child. So while you have a right to your opinion, you better come prepared with some solid arguments.", "Nah, I personally understand why you prefer your best friend. Your child would obviously need a a lot of attention if she lost both of her parents. Your best friend would have more time available since he currently doesn\u2019t have kids.\n\nPlus not knowing about sil house situation and go from not sharing to possibly sharing with a cousin could be a good thing or bad thing.\n\nPersonal continued your conversation with your wife when both sober. Personal this doesn\u2019t mean anything if sil or best friend isn\u2019t willing to take your daughter.", "NAH. Ummm have y\u2019all even asked either of them about being your daughter\u2019s guardian in a worse case scenario?", "All parents should have wills stating who they want their child to go to if something happens. It is irresponsible not to organize this.", "How have you not discussed this in 7 years and 9 months??  This is a basic thing that you should have figured out when she first was pregnant, first with each other and then with the person you would want to raise your daughter.  The fact that you are both going around assuming means that you have nothing in writing and if you both died today there could be a massive custody battle- an extra trama your daughter doesn't need - or your daughter could end up in foster care for awhile while it gets sorted out.  Clearly your business and money is not in order at all if you don't have a will sorted out.  Its easy to say oh, my family will take care of that' but a shocking amount of people in this world will steal from orphans.  \n\nTalk about this sober - find a lawyer and sort out a will. Talk to the person you both decide on to see if they are willing - get your financial ducks in order.  \n\nESH - you both waited way too long, this is a basic question to ask when expecting a child.", "NAH BUT EveryoneSH could work (meaning you and your wife). The reality is this is not a conversation to have with just you and your wife, it needs to include other potential parties. This is a conversation to include your best friend and your SIL in on.\n\nTaking on a kid is a commitment. You can't just be like \"here best friend you have a child now!!!\" or \"here SIL you now have 4 daughters!!\" Would they do it...probably...but enthusiasm only goes so far and that doesn't mean that is the best environment.\n\nFor example regarding your best friend: Would your best friend even want the responsibility? If you die he now is running a business solo AND going to be a full time caregiver for a child who just lost their parents AND also it sounds like you expect him to be the executor for your will and take on some financial burden alongside that. What about your best friends partner if they have one? What if they get a partner and that changes? If they are single are they really okay with the challenges of being a single dad of a daughter (because that is what he would be in this scenario), and is HE equipped to manage and deal with that successfully. And ultimately what would that be the BEST environment for your daughter. This isn't about if your daughter NEEDED someone to take care of her would he step up, because you know that answer is yes, but it is a question as to is he the best person you have available to raise your daughter if it came to it. Maybe the conclusion is yes he is the best...or maybe not, that is beyond reddits paygrade\n\nFor example regarding your SIL: How would adding in 4th child be managed? That is a substantial amount of work, and again a child that just lost their parents. Would SIL agree to do this? Does SIL feel like she could do this? Is there any potential conflict with your daughter and any of her children? Would you daughter manage a busy house well and would that be the BEST environment for your daughter? \n\nWhat I WILL say is \"he learnt how to cook for the first time in his life so that he could make dinner for us when we were struggling with raising a new born\" is not exactly a resounding endorsement of your best friends capability of raising a daughter. Don't get me wrong it is a resounding endorsement of the quality of person he is, and I have no doubt he would put in a lot of effort into doing the best he could...but that doesn't me he would actually be the best option for your daughter. \n\n**tl;dr This is a situation you need to communicate with all parties involved. This is also a situation where ego's have absolutely no place in the conversation. But you did good holding off on the conversation for when you are sober. Approach it with level heads, from the perspective of what is best for your daughter, but also how the burdens will be managed, for others around you.**", "INFO: did you really bring this up with your friend before you talked to your wife about it?", "Yes blood is not always the best fit. So many questions to ask and think about.\n\n1. Is your friend married?\n2. Is married any kids or do they want kids?\n     - no kids is his wife ok to raise ur daughter \n     - kids - how do they get along\n     - how would they blend together \n     - how do they punish\n3. If not married or in a relationship \n   - does he date a lot\n   - how close is he to her\n    - is she comfortable going places alone with him\n     - does he want to raise her\n\nThe SIL\n\n    - can she handle another child \n     - are they financially good\n     - how would the kids feel/ would they welcome her\n     - how is punishment \n     - how is her husband \n      - how would they use her money\n      - what would the daughter want\n\nYou can have your friend as financial over the money and SIL for primary. You can also\nMake sure both are always in your daughters life per the will.\n\nWhat about education. Is your daughter in a better school and going withSIL will change to public. Will they support her going to coy if she wants. \n\nLots of conversations need to be had and look at the full picture.", "Mildly ESH, as both of you seem to be making generalizations about what each party might be capable of. As other people have said, you should also consider the opinions of the people involved, including to some extent your daughter. While you obviously don't want to flat out ask a child who they want to be with if their parents are dead. You might want to observe the way your child relates to her aunt and cousins, does she not like them or might she want their support during such a difficult time.", "NTA but what does bf say abt it? You can leave all your assets in trust to yr daughter & make the bf the trustee even if yr sil ends up w her custody. That way bf can see that the money is protected & kept for when yr daughter reaches the age to take control. If it's lots a dough a lot of people keep it in trust til the offspring is 25. Also if you & wife each make wills you can specify who you want to have raise yr child. She could list her sis & you put the best friend.", "NTA, here's why:\n\n- your SIL already has children, i.e an additional child would be an additional cost to her financially and in every other way, it may be the difference between SIL being comfortable or struggling to support all the children \n\n- if your best friend would be comfortable with it, you're right there is no reason it has to be a blood relative.\n\nWe are also planning on having our children go to friends vs family, only because all our siblings seem child free at least for the moment and we don't feel it's fair to ask my MIL due to her age and health.", "NTA.  Our son would go live with some of our friends if something happens to both of us.  We feel they would be able to give him the upbringing we planned to.  We both have siblings, but they all respect our decision.", "What did your best friend say when you asked him about this?", "NTA. A lot of things need to be thought about when making this decision, and agree you both need to have the talk when sober and calm.\n\nMe and hubby are a bit more like you, we want our 6yo to go to my best friend and her partner. Our 6yo loves them, they are kind and thoughtful people, they love her so much and I know they will raise her right. I have a sister with a son and we do love them so much. But she has no routine, no real discipline and their house is a dump. Easy choice for us. Blood family doesn't always mean the best option. We can choose who our family is.", "Your friend seems like a good choice, and if he is willing, that is great.", "Let whoever will teach her correct grammar have her.\n\n\\*My wife and I\n\nYTA", "NTA. You absolutely must make the choice that is best for your child after carefully weighing the pros and cons - and ASKING your preferred guardian if they would be willing to take on the responsibility.\n\nPlease have this discussion soon, and get your wills done and your preferences legally documented asap. You don't want to leave this to the whims of whomsoever happens to be your legal next of kin should you both die in a fiery car crash this tomorrow.\n\nAnd get some life insurance so that your child will be well taken care of!!", "NTA, but this needs to be settled between you and your wife. It took my husband and I months to decide. Our focus was on who was going to continue raising our kiddo along the path we were taking. Who had our values (or at least similar enough)? Who was financially responsible? Who valued education the way we do? Where would kiddo end up living? Who had the time and heart to help through the grieving process? \n\nI saw you said your friend was willing. What about SIL? She may already have her hands full. \n\nIn addition to determining the guardian, you also need to have estate planning done. Please get a good attorney who specializes in estate planning. It is well worth the money. \n\nI\u2019ll echo what others have said - get life insurance!!!! You need an amount for inheritance AND for the guardian who is raising her. Make sure her inheritance is locked up in a trust fund. \n\nLast, make sure that your daughter knows that plans are set up. It is likely that this is all for naught. But there is a reassurance for a child in knowing that plans are in place. When I was growing up, I knew who my guardian would be if something happened. I knew the care my parents took in selecting them.", "NTA\n\nAfter my parents, 2 of my best friends are the people I would trust with my (non-existent) children before any other family members.", "NTA\n\nFinancially: If she did go to one of her aunts, that aunt would now have to care for 2+ kids (idk which aunt/s have children). I'm also not sure how stable each aunt is. So, if she went to one and they already struggle with money, that's only creating more problems. Whereas your friend has no kids and would likely have enough money to easily support her.\n\nEmotionally: If your daughter went to an aunt who has kid(s), that may cause the kids to fight. There is a chance that your daughter might feel isolated/different because she doesn't have the same parents as her cousins. Kind of like animals entering others' territory (bad reference but only one I could think of). Whereas, if she was with your friend, the relationship with her cousins wouldn't change.\n\nExperience: Yes, your SIL(s) have more experience with kids, but your friend learned how to cook for you because he cares so much, and I imagine he'd do the same and learn about childcare if your daughter went with him.", "NTA-neither of you are. Sit down and discuss this calmly, and find a way to arrive at the same page. You both get a vote and you both likely have valid reasons. After you decide, you still have to ASK. They get a say. \n\nMy opinion (which I know doesn\u2019t matter): you are already putting your friend in control of finances, so it makes sense to me for your daughter to be with her female cousins rather than a friend who is childless. You also don\u2019t mention that your friend is married, so I can\u2019t imagine completely disrupting his life like this. Lastly, you don\u2019t offer any major concern about the sister. Do you think she\u2019s a good parent? What is their family structure?", "NTA. Have a conversation soberly and with your friend and sister-in-law and then make a determination. You have a child. You need a will.", "NTA, but no point in worrying about it, your daughter would be well taken care of either way. If you live in the US and you both passed, it would be the decision of the court to decide custody of your child, although a living will would help.

Or are you only claiming he'd be 'willing' (without discussing it with him), because you want to bolster your case here on AITA?! Either possibility makes YTA, btw. \n\nI also think you're doing your best to discredit your SIL's family, by saying they won't be 'fit' - because you assume they can't 'afford' another child. But that's why you get life insurance, so your child is financially catered for? I don't believe you aren't aware of that, nor other money you could leave for your child (you are a business partner, and have a home, after all).\n\nThis would normally be a situation with no assholes. But you aren't fairly considering the pluses and minuses of possible caregivers, in relation to your child. You're exaggerating your SIL's inability to care for your child - and possibly exaggerating your friend's willingness to do so. I think you're projecting your own issues onto this (anger at your own biological family, idealisation of your friend), rather than fairly balancing the options. \n\nThe first consideration is whether both options actually AGREE to it (and I'm not convinced you actually HAVE clarified this properly with your friend. And if you did, then you're an asshole for cutting your wife out of the loop there. It's a JOINT decision- NOT just yours. It's troubling you'd think it appropriate to be making such huge decisions about your child with your friend first - before your wife, like she's just an afterthought).\n\nAnd if both parties do agree (and are both objectively suitable), consider who your child is most comfortable with. And that will require you to set aside your own personal hang-ups and issues re: 'biological family', and look at it more objectively. If your daughter is spending more time with her Aunt and cousins, she's likely to be more bonded with them. \n\nAnd whilst plenty of parents have no childcare experience before having a child, it may be helpful if those with childcare experience (and a stronger bond with the child) take on a grieving child. Think of your daughter's comfort after such a tragedy- not only your own personal anger and issues towards your own biological family.", "Then you are not the asshole at all.  I don\u2019t think your wife is wrong, but if your daughter is comfortable being an only kid then introducing her to a family with multiple kids would not be ideal when there\u2019s a lot of change going on.\n\nIn the end, though, hopefully this entire thread becomes moot.\n\nNTA", "That was beyond inappropriate.", "Life insurance most likely will have cover any debts op has and funeral arrangements.

Formulas exist for this.  \n\nIf you change and take out more debt for some reason you buy more life insurance.  \n\nAnd if a child is orphaned that money doesn't become a bonus paid at age 18 - you compensate the cost of their upbringing in the form of payment to the child's guardian.", "This! My parents died and I was raised by a relative. They could not afford to raise me so I went without things. They got into massive debt but I got a payout as an adult from the life insurance.

Less for an older child, more for a younger one and then a bit extra.  You increase it when you add debt and you can decrease it as your debt gets smaller or the kids become adults.  You also have a rough idea about what a funeral would cost too but you can prepay a funeral and a plot.\n\nIf you have equity in the house, that is often sold as part of the assets.  The reason we were told this was that if the kids are young and the people that they live with already have a home, it becomes a burden to look after the place ie rent it out or whatever.  The lawyer doing our wills said that there is reasonable right for the person looking after the kids to use some of the money to make improvements to the house to benefit the kids ie add an extra bedroom or buy a bigger car ie if they need a bigger than 5 seater, they can get a 7 seater.\n\nBasically you really want to trust the people you are leaving your kids with, they they are not there just for the money and the benefit they get from it.", "My point is that it may not be enough to raise their child. The costs are only gonna get higher. You would want there to be enough to last longer than 18.", ">Basically you really want to trust the people you are leaving your kids with, they they are not there just for the money and the benefit they get from it.\n\nIn some jurisdictions you can also split the money and the child - my parents' will, when I was a child, had physical custody going to my uncle, but financial guardianship going to a family friend who is an accountant - he'd have been an extra protection that money was only used appropriately (but that would, of course, have included things like making sure there was a large enough house / bigger car).", "To you last point, the best way to handle the money (at least in the US) is usually to have the trustee for the kids\u2019 money be a different person than the guardian of the kids.  Not only does this protect against the guardian misusing the funds, but it also protects the guardian against accusations of misusing the funds. I had friends go through that when the aunt of the child they were guardian of (friend\u2019s child) came out of the woodwork years later and it was held even though the aunt\u2019s accusations were completely unfounded.\n\nWe have one person designated as our kids\u2019 guardian, a second designated as back-up in case that person couldn\u2019t do it, and a third person designated as trustee of the trust that would receive the kids\u2019 inheritance/life insurance proceeds.", "Which is why you set it up to take care of them. There's entire careers where people study this and make it their job. \n\nBottom line -who has the most money shouldn't factor into the decision making process of who gets the child, because you should structure things so that the guardian gets compensation for expenses related to the child. Not necessarily all the money, but enough so that it's not a financial burden."]}
