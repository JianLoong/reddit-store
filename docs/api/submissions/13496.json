Honestly, your work schedule is more the issue here than the kid\u2019s school. At the ages your kids are, them missing a few days is really no big deal. Young ones are less academically rigorous and more focused on learning how to be a student. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it until around 3rd grade. That\u2019s when things change focus to a more academically-minded curriculum. As long as they can read and do basic addition/subtraction by 3rd grade, they\u2019ll be fine.

Is this somewhere in the USA...?\n\n\nCan't imagine the school being so... desperate or controlling that they would require parents to provide a sick note when the child is sick.

It also bothers me that, based on your comments, he is saying that you are not taking his feelings into consideration, but essentially what he wants is ONLY his feelings to be taken into consideration; otherwise, he would see that you are thinking of three people and reworking their days vs just his.
