It\u2019s not just pulling the kids from school. You\u2019re forced to scramble to get your work done.", "Could you extend the day off of school to Monday instead of Friday, so the kids could attend the Easter egg hunt . . . you could have more time to accommodate your work schedule . . . etc.?", "NTA. It's really sweet he wants to spend the day with you guys, but it's an inconvenience to everyone else. Your work and the kids' school need to take priority here.", "NTA.  The four year old would be super bummed to miss the easter egg hunt.  The six year old probably would be fine missing a day of kindergarten.  But, most of all, you need to be able to work.  And, as a parent with two young children, you are probably already constantly having to shift things around to accommodate their school holidays and days off and sick days and snow days and spring break and so on and on.", "NTA, he can wait a few hours", "NAH. Honestly, your work schedule is more the issue here than the kid\u2019s school. At the ages your kids are, them missing a few days is really no big deal. Young ones are less academically rigorous and more focused on learning how to be a student. I wouldn\u2019t worry about it until around 3rd grade. That\u2019s when things change focus to a more academically-minded curriculum. As long as they can read and do basic addition/subtraction by 3rd grade, they\u2019ll be fine. And having a family weekend in another town is basically the best form of field trip. \n\nHowever, your work schedule is important and if it will put you behind, that\u2019s something to consider.", "I wouldn't call you an asshole, but at that age, one day out of school won't hurt anything.", "NTA\n\nIts just a few hours that he can rest and you won't need to shuffle the work around while he enjoys time with kids. Why what he wants is more important than the schedule of 3 people that he loves so much?", "NTA but! My mom used to take me out once every other week to spend time together (brother and I rotated weeks) and it was some of my best memories. \n\nThat said he can wait a few more hours", "NTA. He's only been gone for 5 days.", "NAH. Knowing kids, your youngest would be heart broken to miss the Easter egg hunt even if it\u2019s to go on a train ride. It\u2019s sweet dad missed y\u2019all enough that he\u2019s asking but it\u2019s not really beneficial to anyone but himself and he could definitely wait. Especially with one kid having missed school from a recent Illness. Idk how it is where you live but I\u2019m from the USA and we can miss roughly 10 days of school before we get into huge trouble so I personally wouldn\u2019t simply based on that. \n\nExtending the trip into Monday sounds like a fantastic idea though if it would work for you work wise.", "NTA. \n\nDoes your husband want to teach your kids that they can just not go to school or work if it interferes with something else they'd prefer to do? Will he blame himself if they skip school when they're teens, or can't hold down a job because they're undependable?\n\nWhile family is important, so is reliability. It's only one day until they aren't in school.\n\nBTW, that guilt trip about you not placing importance in what he wants is a red flag. He's putting you way out by expecting you to use your PTO and take 2 young kids on a 4-5 hour train ride, interfering with the kids' routine & schooling. He's the one that chose a job that requires travel, not you.", "NTA.", "NTA, especially when you said that the kids are off school the next week and they can spend plenty of time with him then. Can he shuffle around his own work on the Monday afterward to spend the day with them? I almost said N A H, but unless there's more to the story, this is a bit dramatic for wanting the kids to go to school:\n\n>He got upset about this and feels that it's not important to me what he wants.\n\nIt's sweet that he wants to spend the day with the kids, but since the 6-year-old is already behind from missing school when she was sick and the 4-year-old would have to miss the Easter egg hunt... he doesn't always get what he wants.", "NTA. He comes home on Friday, he'll have the weekend to spend with them. Making your little kids take a long train ride early in the morning to go pick up their dad is not ideal. Your youngest has a school activity that I assume they're looking forward to as well. Let the kids go to school, he can wait a few more hours to see them.", "NTA. He should find a different job if he doesn\u2019t like being away from the kids sometimes.", "YTA, really? They're not missing out on a quantum physics lesson. Your husband is right", "Yta.", "NAH\n\nIt's great he wants that (mean that non-sarcastically) but the fact is, he isn't bearing the brunt of the effort involved, so... it's your call. Also, being away a few days is not such a major homecoming event, let's not exaggerate.", "Sounds like he\u2019s gonna have to waste a whole day until you guys arrive.
