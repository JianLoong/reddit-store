Did you congratulate her? Celebrate with the family afterwards? Get her a bunch of flowers? Or did you just not show up and say nothing?\n\nYour only information on why you don't like your sister is also pretty vague - it's the kind of thing that might be totally true, or it might be something you're saying to justify a not-otherwise-justifiable dislike.

Your sister and family feel this way because this is a \"milestone event.\"  It's understandable.\n\nYour choice to prioritize the interview over it is reasonable and rational (and what I'd do myself.)\n\nEveryone is \"correct\" in this situation, just for different reasons.\n\nGood luck with your interview, hope it goes smashingly!", "NTA. As far as I'm concerned, almost the nastiest thing you could do to anyone is make them go to a graduation.

By law they have to finish it, so the American trope of having a Graduation is rather mad.

All of them think they know everything. You most likely also went through an annoying phase. Interviews don't take all day. Even if you could not have attended the ceremony, you could have given your sister a card with your congratulations. You could have gone to a nice dinner with your family to celebrate. It sounds like because you don't like her, you chose to ignore her. You've probably worsened the relationship with your sister. She's young and still has some growing up to do. So I think you're judging her too harshly.

Plus, I hate listening to speeches.", "I used to approach it that way too, because I was able to coast through high school. But as I've gotten older, I appreciate that my experience isn't everyone else's. For some people, graduating high school IS a big deal. Maybe they have mental health struggles. Maybe they're not academically inclined and really had to work their tails off. And for kids graduating this past spring, COVID started their freshman year and derailed half their high school careers.", "I didn't go to mine either and I don't regret it in the slightest.
