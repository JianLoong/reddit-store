It's less than 1sq mile of bars and restaurants. Needless to say, on the weekend it gets busy. \n\nThis is one of the last few spots in town that does not have paid parking, and as you can imagine it's always a first come first serve basis. There are a lot of parking lots and spaces on the street, but when it's busy (like the weekend) it's hard to find a spot anywhere, and usually have to park in a side road in the adjacent streets/neighborhood. \n\nI arrived in the area and drove through the lot I normally park. It was full, which I suspected, so I drove around the block knowing that a space will open. (I don't mind driving around a bit and waiting if it means parking right next to the place I'm getting food.) \n\nAs I came around, I saw a car pulling out of a spot in the lot to my left. I put on my turn signal and waited for traffic to clear before I turned in. As I was turning in, and aiming towards the spot (which was the 2nd spot into the lot from the main road), a lady ran over and held her hand up, motioning that she's holding that spot. \n\nI was already 1/4 of the way turned into the spot when this happened, and there was a car behind me also pulling in. I told her she can't hold a spot, it's free parking and it's the busiest night of the week. Her and the guy she was with said that they were holding it for out of town family to park, and the car that just left was also her family who gave up the spot for the other people. \n\nAfter 2 minutes of sitting, she said \"oh, there they are! They're pulling in now!\" ***2 minutes trying to hold a parking spot on a busy weekend in a hotspot in town***\n\nI refused to move, and sat there as cars lined up waiting to also pull in. She said, \"look, there's another spot down there you can move to.\" Which I replied, \"then go try to hold that one. I'm parking here.\" \n\nHer and the guy with her called me a douchebag, said \"are you seriously that big of an asshole\" as I got out of my car.\n\nTLDR: AITA for refusing to look for another parking spot because someone wants to hold it for a friend on the busiest night of the week?\n\n\nETA: I have dashcam of it as well.
