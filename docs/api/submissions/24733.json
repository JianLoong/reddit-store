Also got a bit confused reading this and thought some random old lady was pointing to a woman you'd never seen before, insisting she was your mum, and so you got fed up and made up some random story about this total stranger, which I thought was mean to the stranger. Now I've understood what actually happened, yeah not an ah at all. I'm sorry you had such a horrible childhood, it makes me so sad to see people treat their kids this way when there are so many good people desperate and unable to be parents. If you can't treat you child with love, then give that child to a loving family who will.", "Wow that's was totally more deep then I expected. \nI'm so sorry op. \n\nNTA.
