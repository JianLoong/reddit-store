{"id": 31107, "submission_id": "17wrz3r", "title": "AITA for sending my sons teacher a letter over her perfume allergy?", "selftext": "I have 2 sons that are going through the change. They be stanking sometimes and we\u2019ve been trying out options to get their hygiene under control. We\u2019ve tried different types and brands and they found an option they like that doesn\u2019t irritate their skin, and keeps the stink away. Yesterday my son came home and told me his art teacher told me to tell me that she doesn\u2019t like his perfume and she\u2019s allergic to it. I asked him if he put on his dads cologne and went to smell him but nothing. I just smelled the deodorant and the fabric softener I use for the laundry. He went on to say he only wears deodorant.  He didn\u2019t understand what she was trying to say either, but that she told him to speak to me about him smelling like men\u2019s perfume. At first I just brushed it off because he doesn\u2019t wear cologne yet. Then my other son walked in and I remembered he has the same art teacher, so I asked him \u201chey has your art teacher told you something about her being allergic to your smell?\u201d He said no and that she is always nice to him. So I thought why is she only pointing one of them out and the other one. They both smell the same. And when their dad heard he said send the teacher a message asking her to further explain. So I did. Today after the kids left to school my SO asked me what I wrote. I showed him the picture of the letter and he wouldn\u2019t stop laughing. He then said I\u2019m not wrong but im an asshole for what I said. This is what I wrote:\n\nTo whom this may concern:\n\n    It has come to my attention that you have an issue with the way my son smells. He does not wear cologne. I have two boys currently going through the change and they stank when they don\u2019t wear deodorant. It\u2019s unhygienic and also I don\u2019t want them to get bullied at school because they smell like onions. Kids are mean and they\u2019re not embarrassed to point out human defects. I would like you to further elaborate on what it is that bothers you? Because my son mentioned you said you\u2019re allergic, yet you haven\u2019t even mentioned this to my other son who is in a different class. They both smell the same, they both use the same deodorant, so I don\u2019t understand why it is an issue with one and not the other. After much thought I have come up with 3 solutions; \n\n1) you buy them a deodorant that works for them and is to your liking. \n2) you deal with them smelling like sweaty onions, and if they get bullied you finna have to take responsibility\n3) you let him wear his deodorant in peace\n\nIf you have another solution im all ears my number is on file and you can call me whenever you\u2019d like. Looking forward to hearing back from you\n\n-Ms.Martinez\n\nAt first I didn\u2019t think I was TA but apparently my husband does and im kind of over here thinking that maybe I should\u2019ve just not told her anything.\n\n\n\n\nLast update and a few notes:\n\nI wrote her a note not an email It isn\u2019t a spray deodorant it\u2019s a stick I haven\u2019t seen unscented deodorant where I live. I always see natural with smells or roll on but they smell like medicine. So I always go for stick deodorant. He\u2019s 9 years old and learning about hygiene I didn\u2019t want him to get discouraged about getting his BO under control. I do not have a direct number to her She didn\u2019t even receive the note\n\nmy son said he forgot his homework folder, so his teacher never got my note. I contacted the school regardless to ask about what I can do or who can I speak to, they said they would look into it, and my son said the principal spoke to him. Thank you to everyone who commented advice and recommendations. I really appreciated them and will be trying them out. Even the people who told me I was wrong. We all need to get called out sometimes to grow. I have to admit I experienced a wide range of emotions through this whole thing and I feel like I\u2019m good now \u263a\ufe0f yes I know I was the AH in this. I accept that. Moving forward I see that I have a chance to make this better for the main people who this is going to affect. I thought that sending out this message was doing right by my kid. I wasn\u2019t considering the large range of situations that could be at play, and that in this case I was not giving the understanding I wanted for my kids. I\u2019m not finna sit here and make excuses as to why I said this, but I really thought I wasn\u2019t being rude. A lot of other parents I know in the city would\u2019ve gone up there ready to beat someone down. Regardless when I do talk to her I\u2019m going to take y\u2019all\u2019s suggestions and start off asking her what happened and just try to be a better person.\n\nPositive or negative thank you to everyone who took the time to respond.", "created_utc": 1700154363, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17wrz3r/aita_for_sending_my_sons_teacher_a_letter_over/", "score": 1136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your son is literally a nine-year-old child. Who knows if someone around him heard that and he could get bullied because of what she said. Her behavior was completely inappropriate and you reacted like a mother would. Sometimes when someone you love and care about gets embarrassed, like that, you\u2019re not going to be rational.", "YTA.  Sounds like your son needs to be taken out of her class since he can't control his 'stank'.", "I go to a gym attached to a high school. Some kids come early and use the gym locker room to get ready . The locker room smells so pretty when they leave !!! That said , I have no idea how any teacher could work with allergies . These kids are full of deodorants etc etc . I\u2019ve often wondered how the classrooms smells with them packed together \ud83d\ude02", "ESH- have a conversation. I am allergic to SOME perfumes/aftershaves etc due to chemical sensitivity because of a medical condition.", "YTA. Jesus Christ, this email is all types of defensive. You made an assumption and fucking ran with it like you want to start shit.\n\nMaybe the one kid put deodorant on thicker or more recently than the other kid, and the smell was more obvious or noticeable.\n\nEither way,  you're assuming after 1 conversation with 1 party that this woman has it out for your son, and that's extremely obvious from your email. This is the type of shit that makes teachers not want to teach - moms who assume their baby is special and the teacher must be wrong. \n\nAll you had to say was,  'Hey, my son doesn't wear fragrance, just scented deodorant, so there's nothing to aggravate your allergies. Please let me know if there's anything else going on.' and leave it at that.", "YTA. My general rule of thumb is to find the most respectful interpretation of what was said and start from there. You jumped immediately into a \"who do you think you are\" attitude, which doesn't help. \n\nYou could have said \"Kid just told me that something on his body or clothes is triggering an allergic reaction for you. I want to find out exactly what it was so this doesn't happen again. He doesn't wear cologne, but we use such-and-such deodorant, could it be that? Is it possible it's the fabric softener?\" \n\nLike the man says, be curious, not judgemental.

The chemicals in these react differently with each person own chemistry (sweat) so one of your son\u2019s chem reacting with the deodorant maybe the issue. You\u2019re not obligated to know this, I think the redaction of the letter is a bit odd, but I wouldn\u2019t take in the wrong way, however I agree you should speak in person with said teacher and explain to them you are only trying to understand how to help without having stinky teen sons", "NTA. If it\u2019s really an issue, the teacher should go through the nurse. You are hilarious. Kids stink. If she can\u2019t handle deodorant or smell covers, she shouldn\u2019t teach preteens and teens.", "NTA teacher should\u2019ve contacted you directly & not gone through your child. yes you were snarky in the letter, but you\u2019re a parent wondering why your child is getting singled out in class while your other one is not. it was a valid response in the moment & you can always clear it up with the teacher later on like \u201ci apologize for my attitude in my previous message. I just didn\u2019t want my child being treated differently based on his scent, if there\u2019s anything i can do to accommodate your allergy further let me know, help me understand ect.\u201d momma bear came out, but that does not make you a bad mother, or a bad person in general. you handled the situation in the best way you knew how & hopefully the teacher learns you are not the one to play with & it needs to be more professional from here on out to avoid these type of messages being sent.", "YTA. Buy scentless stuff and stop being so snarky.", "Switch fabric softeners. Maybe it's that. I can't tolerate Downey, and my sis used to douse her clothes in that stuff.", "ESH except your son.

Going back to school after the pandemic was the worst as every kid had scented sanitizers.  I ended up also talking to our art teacher at one point because she had the kids use this godawful gingerbread sanitizer.  Fifteen kids came back into my room with it on and I ended the day with a migraine and had to pull over and puke on my way home.  \nI don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so hard to handle this as an adult and why you had to give such crappy \u201csolutions.\u201d", "Teachers have to deal with some nasty smellin classrooms okay, cut the woman some slack.

He doesn't wear perfume. Just trying to resolve the matter. Let me know your thoughts.\"\n\nThen, if she comes back and insists that he wears perfume, you can tell her what fabric softener you use and his brand of deoderant (maybe she's sensitive to those?). Then simply say that if she is not sensitive to either one of those, you will simply carry on status quo. And if she wants to address something in the future, she can reach out to you directly. \n\nYour email is simply 1. Giving way too much info that no one cares about and solves nothing and 2. Emphasizes the \"stank\" way too much. I don't use \"cringe\" a lot, but yeah.", "Hey OP, I'm allergic to fragrance so let me help clear up a couple of things:\n\n1. It's not about the smell. The smell is just an indicator that the allergen is in the room with you and, in my case, my cue to get out if I wanna keep breathing. To be clear, mine is life-threatening and I've been into anaphylaxis and almost died from it. \n2. Some fragrances are more tolerable than others. While some send me into immediate reaction where I can't breathe, others just give me rash/eye watering first before I get to the part where I can't breathe. \n3. Intensity is a factor. If one of your kids is drowning themselves in the fragrance and not the other, that might be the issue.\n4. There is fragrance in everything (toilet cleaners, room fragrance, perfume, cologne, deodorant, etc). This makes being in any public space a nightmare for management. The only real solution is to remove yourself from environments that affect you. Sometimes, there are no workarounds. The only saving grace is being confident enough to ask those that can help or around you a lot to please refrain from fragrance if they can help it. It's nobody else's problem but yours, but you just have to hope people will be kind. That means YTA for gaslighting this teacher. Maybe see if there are ways you can make it work without putting her at risk or ruining her life. Have you tried being a compassionate person?\n\nAlso, my partner's son going through puberty and doesn't stink (and we live in a hot and steamy part of the world) so it sounds like you're making weird excuses for your kids' lack of hygiene. Maybe that's on you.", "NTA at all. I thought your letter got to the point, offered solutions, and was even mildly amusing without being defensive. As other teachers pointed out, email is definitely the right choice for this non-urgent communication with a busy school teacher.  She can respond at her first opportunity, and either provide more details so you can figure out the source of her discomfort, or she can offer additional solutions that may work well. \n\nIt's clear you are trying to help find a solution for your boys that will also not offend her sense of smell or activate allergies in her workplace, which is thoughtful. If you still are concerned about how the letter is received you could send a quick follow-up with her to make sure she understood the helpful, understanding, and kind of funny tone of the email.

They be stanking sometimes and we\u2019ve been trying out options to get their hygiene under control. We\u2019ve tried different types and brands and they found an option they like that doesn\u2019t irritate their skin, and keeps the stink away. Yesterday my son came home and told me his art teacher told me to tell me that she doesn\u2019t like his perfume and she\u2019s allergic to it. I asked him if he put on his dads cologne and went to smell him but nothing. I just smelled the deodorant and the fabric softener I use for the laundry. He went on to say he only wears deodorant.  He didn\u2019t understand what she was trying to say either, but that she told him to speak to me about him smelling like men\u2019s perfume. At first I just brushed it off because he doesn\u2019t wear cologne yet. Then my other son walked in and I remembered he has the same art teacher, so I asked him \u201chey has your art teacher told you something about her being allergic to your smell?\u201d He said no and that she is always nice to him. So I thought why is she only pointing one of them out and the other one. They both smell the same. And when their dad heard he said send the teacher a message asking her to further explain. So I did. Today after the kids left to school my SO asked me what I wrote. I showed him the picture of the letter and he wouldn\u2019t stop laughing. He then said I\u2019m not wrong but im an asshole for what I said. This is what I wrote:\n\nTo whom this may concern:\n\n    It has come to my attention that you have an issue with the way my son smells. He does not wear cologne. I have two boys currently going through the change and they stank when they don\u2019t wear deodorant. It\u2019s unhygienic and also I don\u2019t want them to get bullied at school because they smell like onions. Kids are mean and they\u2019re not embarrassed to point out human defects. I would like you to further elaborate on what it is that bothers you? Because my son mentioned you said you\u2019re allergic, yet you haven\u2019t even mentioned this to my other son who is in a different class. They both smell the same, they both use the same deodorant, so I don\u2019t understand why it is an issue with one and not the other. After much thought I have come up with 3 solutions; \n\n1) you buy them a deodorant that works for them and is to your liking. \n2) you deal with them smelling like sweaty onions, and if they get bullied you finna have to take responsibility\n3) you let him wear his deodorant in peace\n\nIf you have another solution im all ears my number is on file and you can call me whenever you\u2019d like. Looking forward to hearing back from you\n\n-Ms.Martinez\n\nAt first I didn\u2019t think I was TA but apparently my husband does and im kind of over here thinking that maybe I should\u2019ve just not told her anything.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She is an adult and she can do what the rest of us do when we don\u2019t like how another person smells. We deal with it. especially if you only see that person for a limited amount every day.

Boys can smell bad, but sweaty onions isn't a normal odor for people to have if they have good hygiene.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain here and say NTA.

If you think that's what this sub is for, you're probably why rule #1 exists in the first place.", "ahhh gotcha! guess it\u2019s just slowly fading away with these things being more talked about XD\n\nimagining the teacher like \u201c\u2026her boys are going through menopause? huh\u201d is amazing", "They do go through a stinky phase when they are all the sudden about to start eating a lot around 9, get a little chubby heading into 11 and then the bones start to grow and they thin out again. At least all my boys and grandboys did.", "She might have said something else and the child used the word perfume. The teacher said something\u2014> kid perceived the message then restated to his mom\u2014>mom perceived the message then restated it to the teacher/us on the internet. There\u2019s a lot of places where the message can break down here.", "There is no legit way for you or I to know what the teacher said, so that is not something I am willing to comment or speculate on.", "It's really not. If she had real allergies, a notice would be sent to the class, not just one student. Very rare for someone to have a reaction to one student's deodorant but be fine with all of the scented chapstick and lotions the girls would be using.", "I\u2019ve had parents come up to me at dismissal and don\u2019t know what grade their kid is in. Let alone their teachers name.  It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous and a sign of crappy parenting.", "Y'all must have lived in some tiny ass towns or something. By 7th grade I had 6 separate teachers. I have 3 siblings. Every year my parents were dealing with 20-30 teachers, and then another new 15 the year after that. I don't think it's unreasonable that someone doesn't know the name of an art teacher. Unless this is a specialized art class as therapy or something, 0 interaction with an art teacher seems perfectly normal.", "It's very possible she mistaken his smell with another kid. It is also possible that the other son didn't not get close enough to her during his class time for her to be able to smell him.", "It could be a combination of things, I am asthmatic I can\u2019t tell you how many times my students have triggered an attack.  Ask her if she doesn\u2019t mine sharing what triggers her. I would have set up a meeting an just ask what\u2019s the difference.  Why do you feel one child smells and the other one doesn\u2019t.  Do they see her at the same time each day or does one see her in the morning and one in the afternoon? Just because they are the same age and changing doesn\u2019t mean they have he same body chemistry. One of my students can put on a scent and it reacts well with her body chemistry and another puts it on and it smells awful.  Hormones play a huge factor as their little bodies starts to change.", "You\u2019ve probably heard this already by this time, but body chemistry affects smell. It happens with perfumes and colognes and, yes, deodorants. Everyone has different body chemistry, so it could be that one of the boys really does have a more noticeable scent! (I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s that and not that the teacher is picking on him).\n\nBtw I did think your note was pretty rude, but I\u2019m impressed at how you\u2019ve handled all this feedback with grace. Good job and you are not an asshole lol", "Perhaps one kid is in the room during a hotter time\nOf day and it smells more. Perhaps it is a larger class so there are more bodies. Perhaps your one kid sits closer to her desk. Perhaps this kid puts way more on than the other. The fact that you are paranoid to think that she is picking on your kid and you immediately jump down her throat is not a good look for you. Civilly asking why she seemed to think your son was wearing cologne when he wasn\u2019t and pointing out that your other kid uses the same deodorant and fabric softener etc is the way to go. YTA massively for your tone and YTA again for acting like her telling one son this and not the other is some big \u201cshe is lying cuz she hates this kid!\u201d BS.", "While that's true, we can only comment on what the op presents as their pov. So it doesn't matter what the teacher said. What matters is how her delivery came off first to op's son, and then to op herself. As a professional, it is her job to defend her professionalism with all of her clients, and as a teacher her students and their parents are her clients.", "Or this is a new exposure that she's never run into before.", "\u201cBody spray swamp butt??\u201d", "This isn\u2019t 7th grade. The kid is 9.", "6x3 \u2260 20-30", "Yeah and my mom had a list of each teacher for each child for each class so that when she was picking us up for shit or calling about a problem she could say \u201cI need so and so they\u2019re in social studies with Mr T\u201d she had 5 kids", "Sometimes we don\u2019t like what is being said but that doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t need to hear it. I can\u2019t get upset after I exposed myself to the criticism of others, because my point in posting this was either to get validated or told I was wrong so that I can fix it. It\u2019s refreshing to hear different points of view from people who aren\u2019t your friends/family.", "They are only 9 years old though..so 4th grade(??)", "And she instantly knew it was this one kid?", "So they have 4-6 teachers instead of my exact 6.", "If you have 3 siblings, how many children do your parents have? Lmao, such a reddit moment\n\nBesides the fact, that I had 12 teachers one year in highschool.", "No but 6\u00d74 is and since the person said they had 3 siblings, well...you can do the math, maybe.", "Homeroom for a lot of grade schools just means \"main teacher\", it's not a class.", "He may even think he\u2019ll get in trouble. I mean, the kid is 9 and OP seems really hung up on the fact they tried so many deodorants before finding the one he\u2019s meant to wear now."]}
