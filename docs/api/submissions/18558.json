Your idea of displaying the rings in a glass case under your grandfather\u2019s portrait in your house is a great compromise. This way, you're honoring your grandfather and the family history, without compromising on your feelings about the wedding rings.\n\nConsider having a candid conversation with your family about your feelings and your plans to honor your grandfather in other ways. If your family understands that this decision is coming from a place of deep respect for your marriage and your fianc\u00e9e, and not from a place of disrespect for your family or your grandfather, they may come to accept it.\n\nAt the end of the day, your wedding is about the love between you and your fianc\u00e9e, and the choices you make should reflect that love and the future you're building together.", "NTA, although I think you\u2019re a bit loony.", "NTA, it's your choice... but...\n\nBlaming infidelity on bad luck or jewelry is childish. People who cheat choose to do so. They didn't put those rings on in the morning, slip on a banana peel and Mr. Magoo themselves into intercourse. And by chalking those choices up to silly superstition negates free will and accountability. You're essentially giving your family members a free pass because the rings made them do it. Not wearing specific jewelry will not keep you from cheating or your partner from cheating on you. A good relationship takes work. You can't blame every incident on a superstitious belief in bad luck as it will prevent you from being self-aware and where you can do better as a person (not saying it's your fault if you get cheated on, but this lack of accountability and self-awareness in general often comes along with hardcore superstitious beliefs).", "NTA - as someone who just got married, it was a really special experience for my husband and I to pick out our rings together. I get not wanting to use family rings just because someone told you to (and I also get the negative energy associated with the rings). \n\nCan you do something else with the rings - like maybe melt down the metal and have them made into something else (like earrings or cuff links)? My grandmother was the one who inherited all the jewelry from childless relatives and that was her favorite thing to do with them that way she didn\u2019t feel obligated just to hold onto something because some aunt owned it and actually had a piece she enjoyed wearing. Probably not the best solution to your family, but still gives you the opportunity to wear something passed down to you", "NTA.

OP starts snooping and not trusting the partner. The partner notices the lack of trust and confides in a friend/coworker/bar stranger... Maybe I've just watched too many tv shows lately, ha", "The object isn\u2019t collecting it though, the people are creating it\u2026", "NTA\n\nSuperstitions aside, it\u2019s your wedding & your life. No one gets to dictate it except you.", "NTA, don't bring those vibes into your marriage.", "Actually NTA, but I don't think the rings were bad luck originally, it was probably your toxic family pumping bad energy in.", "NTA because it'd your wedding, your marriage.\n\nA potential compromise would be to have the rings melted down and cast into new rings (or other jewelry) and set the stones in that.", "NTA. I think it is a nice compromise to display them under grandfather's portrait, but you have every right to use wedding rings that make you happy about your bright new future together. \n\nYour family has **absolutely no right** to try to force you into wearing rings that you feel are unlucky. Don't allow them to bully you.", "No person (grandfather included) gets to dictate on their deathbed how you live your life or the choices you make.  \n\nYour wedding, your marriage, your life, your choice.\n\nHowever, my spidey sense is telling me that simply displaying the rings under his picture could rub family members the wrong way. \n\nThat being said, why don\u2019t you pass the rings on to another family member that could potentially use them?  Siblings, cousins, etc?  \n\nNTA\n\nGodspeed", "NTA.  Pass those rings on to the next sibling/cousin in line.  Does not matter if they think it's a silly superstition or not, you aren't comfortable with the idea and that is all that matters.", "NTA\n\nSymbols are powerful, and wedding rings are one of the strongest cultural symbols around.\n\nThat said, that is why your family is upset. They see your rejection of the rings as a statement and judgement on their failed relationships. So just keep that in mind", "Luck isn't real, but NTA. People cheat because of their own bad decision, not because of a ring. (Can you imagine that excuse? \"The ring made me do it.\") But your choice.", "Oh this totally reminded me of a chintzy scifi channel show from like 10+ years ago about objects that absorbed energy and could wreak havoc on the world so this team of men in black-esque government agents tracked them down and took them back to a storage facility a la raiders of the lost ark. It was cute.", "No one gets to dictate what you do or do not do with your wedding rings.\n\nMy Dad has said that he wants me to wear my great-grandmother's engagement ring when I get engaged. She and my great-grandad had a wonderful relationship, good marriage and it didn't end tragically.\n\nI won't be doing that. I don't like the style and I'd rather have a ring that my partner and I choose together.\n\nYou have far more reason to object to those rings than I do.\n\nStand your ground. You're going to be wearing your wedding rings for the rest of your lives. It's very important that you like them.", "If you believe the rings caused luck which caused the cheating, you're not 0% superstitious, you're just superstitious.\n\nThis isn't a mechanical failure in a machine, these were human beings knowingly making the decision to cheat or whatever.\n\nOP is N T A but the rings didn't cause anything.", ">This would be true if the whole concept of wedding rings wasn't based on superstition and intangibles in the first place. The point of a ring is to symbolize the relationship. \n\nIt still is true. You're correct about the symbolism. That doesn't mean that anyone cheated because of luck caused by a ring.", "Naw, it's on break.", "Warehouse 13 I think", "Yeah I agree"]}
