You never promised him you'd use them by the sounds of it, he just decided thats what you'd be doing.", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m not overly superstitious but in this case\u2026.\n\nNew rings it is!", "NTA. Use whatever rings you want to use for your wedding day. Even if you didn\u2019t consider them unlucky, but just didn\u2019t like them aesthetically that would be absolutely fine; it\u2019s your wedding day, not your family\u2019s.", "NTA - Traditions are not laws, merely guidelines. And if they don't work you for, then they don't work for you.", "You are concerned about a spouse dying on you. Isn't that the idea of a wedding, for your spouse to die while you are married? (Or you to die on them?) The whole \"until death do us part\" bit.\n\nNTA for using whatever wedding rings you want to. You might consider passing the heirlooms to a family member who wouldn't mind using them for their intended purpose.", "NTA - as a spiritualist jewelry especially handed down has residual past energy.  i always put jewelry after worn whether new or old into a small bowl of sea salt to clear it.  also i have selenite slab which actually will remove old energy but anything such as past dark karma as in generational karma.  good for you sticking your conviction and just displaying it instead of having them worn.", "Nta\n\n\nYour reasons are your own. Someone else can use the rings. I don't care the reason it's your wedding and marriage.  It's nice your fiancee doesn't mind but it's your decision too.\n\n\nGive the rings back to the family for the next person to use them. I don't understand why they are making this into world war 3.", "NTA\n\nYou're in a tough position, and it's completely understandable that you want to avoid anything that might seem to bring bad luck to your marriage, even if it's just symbolic. Traditions and heirlooms can carry emotional and historical weight, but ultimately, they should bring joy and not distress.\n\nIt's your wedding and you should do what feels right to you and your fianc\u00e9e. The wedding rings that you and your fianc\u00e9e will wear are symbols of your commitment to each other, and it's important that both of you feel comfortable with them.\n\nHowever, the concerns of your family are also understandable, as they are seeing this as a rejection of a family heirloom and a disregard of your grandfather's last wish. The key here is to reassure them that you're not disregarding your grandfather's legacy or the family traditions. Your idea of displaying the rings in a glass case under your grandfather\u2019s portrait in your house is a great compromise. This way, you're honoring your grandfather and the family history, without compromising on your feelings about the wedding rings.\n\nConsider having a candid conversation with your family about your feelings and your plans to honor your grandfather in other ways. If your family understands that this decision is coming from a place of deep respect for your marriage and your fianc\u00e9e, and not from a place of disrespect for your family or your grandfather, they may come to accept it.\n\nAt the end of the day, your wedding is about the love between you and your fianc\u00e9e, and the choices you make should reflect that love and the future you're building together.", "NTA, although I think you\u2019re a bit loony.", "NTA, it's your choice... but...\n\nBlaming infidelity on bad luck or jewelry is childish. People who cheat choose to do so. They didn't put those rings on in the morning, slip on a banana peel and Mr. Magoo themselves into intercourse. And by chalking those choices up to silly superstition negates free will and accountability. You're essentially giving your family members a free pass because the rings made them do it. Not wearing specific jewelry will not keep you from cheating or your partner from cheating on you. A good relationship takes work. You can't blame every incident on a superstitious belief in bad luck as it will prevent you from being self-aware and where you can do better as a person (not saying it's your fault if you get cheated on, but this lack of accountability and self-awareness in general often comes along with hardcore superstitious beliefs).", "NTA - as someone who just got married, it was a really special experience for my husband and I to pick out our rings together. I get not wanting to use family rings just because someone told you to (and I also get the negative energy associated with the rings). \n\nCan you do something else with the rings - like maybe melt down the metal and have them made into something else (like earrings or cuff links)? My grandmother was the one who inherited all the jewelry from childless relatives and that was her favorite thing to do with them that way she didn\u2019t feel obligated just to hold onto something because some aunt owned it and actually had a piece she enjoyed wearing. Probably not the best solution to your family, but still gives you the opportunity to wear something passed down to you", "NTA. At this point I\u2019d be contemplating telling my family how alarmed I was at how much bad feeling these rings were generated and that I\u2019d decided to do the best thing for the entire family and sell them (and the curse) on.", "Light YTA. Yes, it\u2019s your wedding, you and your fianc\u00e9 should be the sole people to decide what rings you wear.
