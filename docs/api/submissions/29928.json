If your fianc\u00e9 can't do that before the wedding, then good luck getting him to stand up for you after the wedding. He'll always choose his family over you. Honeymoons are special. Vacations can be taken whenever.", "NTA. You explained your situation to your family, which they already knew. You offered a solution. You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA !!!\n\nIf they expect you to have your honeymoon on the family trip they are totally crossing boundaries; that is ridiculous.\n\nAlso, you shouldn't ask them to reschedule.  You'll try and join the next family getaway.  For now, the scheduling doesn't work for you, and they already know why.  If they choose to be impossible, that's on them.\n\nTheir blurr of the boundaries does cause me to question what's up with that?  Are they \"trying\" to cause a problem?  I mean here you've planned a wedding and a honeymoon, who in their right mind would even think that people who are employed would have the extra vacation time or free-thrift money to throw at a vacation right after a honeymoon?\n\nAnd who would actually \"expect\" or even \"suggest\" that someone take their honeymoon during a family vacation?  That's not only WIERD but the suggestion is WAY OUT OF LINE - who does that?  So yah, you've got me wondering about intentions here...   Is someone \"trying\" to cause problems?  It actually SEEMS LIKE IT.\n\nWhere's the grace?  Where's the understanding?  Where's the \"caring\" that their son and daughter in law are starting their lives together and want to have a romantic honeymoon getaway ALONE!!!?????\n\nEVEN if you reschedule the wedding and honeymoon, can you still make the vacation?  Is that PRESSURE or IS THAT pressure!??\n\nThis is nuts.\n\nYou're grown ups.\n\nYou're getting married.\n\nGo on your honeymoon.\n\nTell them you can't make the family vacation in 2024.\n\nIt is what it is.", "NTA this seems like a bit of a red flag too, they are not being cool at all\n\nEdit to add: your husband is being a bit spineless here, he should be putting you and your marriage first and not letting Mom and Dad hijack his honeymoon", "NTA. Tell them it's a hard no. Your husband has to put his foot down even if it steps on his parents toes.", "NTA. There will be plenty of opportunities in the future for family vacations.

He's says \"if they're paying then you're going\"-- so basically you'd get no say?  IF they were willing to pay MIL would have mention that when you balked at coming along based on your budget.  \n\nTell you finace that you need to make committments and deposits for your honeymoon and can't have his mom bullying you about the vacation anymore.", "NTA but I would just say something along the lines of \u201cAw, no 50 is not old!

Maybe we can send pics from our honeymoon and you guys can send us pics from your holiday.\u201d Keep it positive but let them know that you will be going on your honeymoon after your wedding.

Its not cool for them to be organising a 'family holiday' a week after your wedding - that is just rude.    But if they aren't backing down, ask them to pay for the plane tickets then............... if they are insisting, it might be easier to keep the peace -\n\n1. Our dollar is crap - just above half of the US dollar so this will be a cheap holiday if you are from the US....\n2. There are some lovely places here - you fly over with the fam, then just leave them for a few days to a nice island in Queensland with your husband.......don't tell them where you are going.......Nov is a good time of year - its just before summer so it isn't too hot (although QLD is nice all year round really).....just make sure you miss 'schoolies' week in QLD - you don't want to get mixed up in that nightmare LOL\n\nedit - \"schoolies\" is the end of the year graduate party time - our school year finishes in Nov........you can drink at 18 here, so its an excuse to go to the gold coast and get wasted apparently.", "NAH.\n\nThere's no obligation for you to join the family trip, but the family can plan whatever trip they like regardless of its proximity to your wedding.", "> his family want to go on this holiday the week after we get married.\n\noh HELL no.
