Airline crew have the right to move passengers as they see fit for safety purposes (both operational and personal safety).\n\nIf the guy had asked your son to move, then gone and spoken to crew after you informed him of what happened, even if he was mean or passive agressive about it, there would be N A H. It was his insistence to continue speaking to your son, even though you asked him to stop, and his refusal to seek out crew (which is the correct thing to do when there is a seat discrepancy).\n\nMaybe the guy paid extra to select a seat (unlikely as that service is normally included with a business ticket). Maybe he's just in a shitty mood and wants to take it out on your kid for not following the \"rules\" as he understands them. The simple fact is that once crew changes a seat, the discussion should be with the affected passenger and the crew.

Obviously neither you nor your son are at fault here, and while the displaced customer isn\u2019t at fault either for the seat swap fiasco, how he handled himself makes him TA in this case (though really it would probably be either the airline or the family with the baby that possibly booked at the last minute and created the issue in the first place had that guy handled himself better).", "NTA.

Then if it turns out that\u2019s 13m\u2019s final seat all good and yes cabin crew should decide that - Jesus everyone calm the farm.

That was your choice, and that's on you, and not on 3A.   If you wanted your son near you, you should have refused moving him.  Instead you simply decided that, as long as your son was taken care of, it was no longer a problem for you.  \n\n\n3A is a window seat.

It was actually a relatively short flight and I was okay without the recline but the whole interaction kind of rubbed me the wrong way.  I did end up complaining to the airline and got a few extra FF points for my trouble (i.e. as compensation for the non-reclining seat).", "The likelihood is they were being moved from 3a to 8a as that was where op\u2019s son was originally being moved to. So it is not really a downgrade of a seat it\u2019s just a bit further back. \n\nNormally I\u2019d have expected this to be sorted out at boarding rather than leaving it to the cabin crew. Mr 3a should have got a reseating then as would Ops family avoiding all this drama. As is written into every seat request or booking you can be moved for operational reasons you can complain but the airline is in their rights. \n\nNAH except for whoever set up the airlines seating system"]}
