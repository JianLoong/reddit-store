Personally, what I think should happen is your sister should reach out to you and let you know that she loves you but she is feeling very sensitive at the moment and will be blocking your feed while she learns to cope better and wishes you well in your pregnancy.

But one caveat...depending on her relationship with her sister, I think OP should actually talk to her about this first. In this post, one thing that jumped out at me is that everything about sister's feelings is coming through the mom. I have no doubt it was tough for the sister to learn about the pregnancy while she struggles with infertility, but it doesn't sound like the sister has said anything about OP's posts at all. For all we know, the sister might be mortified to know that her mom was making this request on her behalf. OP also mentions favoritism, and that makes me wonder if mom has a history of pitting her daughters against each other. If possible within the context of their relationship, I'd suggest OP reach out to her sister in a compassionate but not patronizing way to see what she actually wants. Just a, \"Hey, I know this is a hard time for you, and you're in my thoughts. I'm happy to make sure posts about my pregnancy don't show up on your feed if that's helpful.\"", "That\u2019s a massive assumption on behalf of the sister though, even from her mom.

Is baby allowed to come? \n\nI get she has incredible pain. She needs help to work through that pain. Expecting her sister to accommodate her isn\u2019t right. Unfortunately life goes on and babies are a fact of life.", "To be fair, she doesn\u2019t even know her sister is in pain. This is based on how her mom thinks the sister might feel.

In other comments on this thread, I already suggested that OP meet up with her sister and talk about it. Does sister even care about the posts? Maybe the initial cry mom reported was just one of sadness and frustration for her own situation but she\u2019s not actually resentful or hurt by his sister\u2019s pregnancy. OP can ask her if she wants to be included in things like baby showers, or if she\u2019d prefer to be excluded from Op\u2019s posts. She can ask sister what involvement she\u2019d like with the baby when it\u2019s born. Most infertile women still manage to interact- even joyfully- with their friends\u2019 and families\u2019 babies. Some are not able to function in society, but in this case, there is insufficient evidence here to suggest the sister is that way. Mom is the problem. I\u2019m suggesting OP bypass mom and go directly to her sister. Most likely they can come to a compassionate and reasonable balance. \n\nIf sister is one of those narcissists who expects OP to hide any existence of her child for evermore, OP can feel free to block, ignore, etc, in good conscience, knowing she tried kindness first.", "Do you think it doesn't hurt OP that she can't share this amazing experience with her mother and sister?", "I'm not saying OP should not post, as I said. Just that OP taking literally five.seconds to block only her sister from her posts would be kind. Kindness costs nothing. Is it OP's job? No. Is it offensive to suggest someone be kind? On Reddit it is, apparently.\n\n\n I would take five seconds to block a post from a random person if I knew it would cause them pain. Why would you not?", "Sharing a post on Facebook that causes them.pain is a great way to get them to celebrate with you, right? You must be fun at parties....\n\nBeing real, OP being kind to sister might help mom feel free to celebrate with OP.  Mom won't feel as compelled to protect sister if OP is conveying kindness to her and mom sees that.", "I'm infertile and, yeah, I feel a pang of pain but I'm also happy for my friends and family.  I would be the AH if I took their joy away from them and made them worry about me before sharing their joy with others.  That's incredibly selfish.  Avoiding adversity does nothing to help anyone.", "You seem to be dense. No one is saying OP has to do this. But that it would be kind and OP might want to be kind, because it makes the world better for everyone when people are kind to each other.\n\nIn your world, OP's mother also doesn't 'owe' OP excitement about her pregnancy.  It would be awful of OP's mom to not show OP excitement, but in your world, none of owe anyone any sort of emotional support or kindness. \n\nI hope you like your world. It isn't the one all of us want though. I would take five seconds to block a post from someone if I knew it would cause them pain. The fact that you would not tells me a great deal about your character.", "Not doing something unkind is not the same as being kind. \n\nGeez, I'd happily limit a post about myself from a random person to avoid causing them pain. It would take me five seconds and cause me no pain and save them some. You don't believe that taking fever seconds to help someone is worth it.\n\n\n I really feel from your so-called friends and family if this is what you truly believe. Not showing care for others isn't a flex like you seem to think it is.", "YTA\n\nYou are in your 20s, it is well past the age to be concerned over parental favoritism. Which is really what this post is about. Otherwise you wouldn\u2019t mention it. \n\nYour mom might generally just like your sister better. And honestly, that\u2019s okay. You probably have a parent you prefer too. \n\nYour sister is going through something really hard. Think of it. She cannot get pregnant. She desperately wants to. Her decade younger sister is. She probably feels envy and anger towards you. And deep shame about those feelings because she knows that it is her being incredibly unfair to you. She need time to process it all. I\u2019m projecting a bit, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019m particularly wrong. \n\nYour mom is asking you to be kind to your sister. All you needed to say was I will tone it down and/or use custom audiences for my pregnancy posts", "To be honest, if at 24,the op is about to become a mother and has no empathy to family members, it's hardly like this is all going to go swimmingly is it.\nBeing a parent means making sacrifices and thinking of others first. That alone should mean that her mother's request for reduced coverage, shouldn't be that difficult if she is ready for Motherhood.", "NTA. her fertility issues are not your problem.", "NTA.", "You\u2019re NTA, for being excited about your bundle of joy. But. I was suffering from multiple pregnancy losses, then infertility for years. After the last loss, and essentially, what was thought to be my last chance at having a baby, my best friend got pregnant by her ex husband. Was a 1 time drunk sex thing, and she was having a baby. It was hard seeing her pregnant with a baby she initially didn\u2019t want, when that was all I wanted. Her son was born on what would\u2019ve been my baby\u2019s due date. It was a stab in my heart, but I was happy for her, and sad for myself. She\u2019s a wonderful mother, her ex is a wonderful dad, they\u2019ve figured out coparenting, and they love their son more than anything. My feelings were my own to deal with, and I did. I agree with several others about maybe a selective audience, might be the kind thing to do, if that matters to you.", "NTA\n\nJust filter out mom and sister, if you are not sure how to do it, I am sure you can Google it", "NTA I had to learn when I was struggling with infertility to not push the babies I had in my life away.   She may not be ready, but I'd have a heart to heart talk with her. Ask her how much she wants to know/be involved. She probably doesn't feel any ill will toward you, just wishes it was her too. As far as social media, others have given you advice there and sister can do things to hide you if she needs to.", "NTA. In what protected fantasy world does the sister live? She didn\u2019t prepare herself mentally and emotionally for the day her younger siblings wants to have kids and start their own families? Was she expecting that her siblings stay single and child-free their whole lives to avoid hurting her feelings ?\n\nSister really needs a reality check. She knew this day would eventually come. Why is she trying to make OP feel bad for something most couples wants to experience? And what about when the baby is here? Will sister act like the baby doesn\u2019t exist and avoid the baby for decades? Real loving sisters support each other. Seems like OP\u2019s sister is very jelaous, controlling and insecure.", "Nta", "NTA, your sister can unfollow your posts, if it upsets her, it's horrible having fertility issues, but it's not reasonable to expect everyone to hide their own happiness", "NTA. Your sister can block you on social media. There. Problem solved. If you want to share pregnancy news because it makes you happy why should you stop just for her?", "Okay, here we go again\n\nSay it with me now 'my sisters fertility issues are not my problem to burden'\n\nI am so sick of pregnant ladies having to tiptoe around what is meant to be the most joyous moment of their time. Tell your mother straight that she is not to ruin your moment and your pregnancy joy and if she continues to play favourites, she can kiss goodbye to her grandmother role.\n\nNTA. Congratulations on your pregnancy and I wish you a happy and healthy birth", "Nta", "NTA. Just like you said, it's your happy news to share with everyone you want. From now on, remember to tag your mom and sister in the posts.", "NTA, but just find a social media outlet that your sister isn't on, or filter her out somehow.\n\nI mean, it's your right to share anything you like online, but considering her feelings probably should at least be a passing concern.", "Sister can unfollow her so she doesn't see the posts", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I was in a similar situation, two of my siblings had babies due at the same time I would have been but I miscarried. It was super tough. One sibling was amazing and kind and empathetic about, the other sent their new scan photos (not first ones, updates and gender reveal etc) to our family group chat 10 days after I told them I\u2019d miscarried\u2026I think there\u2019s a lack of empathy here from OP, she could be kinder to her sister. I\u2019m not in any way saying she should hide her pregnancy or feel she can\u2019t have the baby around her family, but just not be in her face about it. And sister can mute her on SM, I muted our family chat & put in place the boundaries I needed to keep myself emotionally safe. \n\nSending you virtual gentle hugs as you go through what you\u2019re going through \u2764\ufe0f", "How does it matter?", "Most social media platforms allow you to mute people without letting them know you've done so, it's a good way to temporarily not see their posts", "The end is to give her sister a little time to work through her negative emotions.", "This. I've had a couple of times in the last few years where I've had to unfollow friends for a period of time because my own mental health was shaky and I couldn't cope with getting notifications of all the wonderful things they were doing pushed into my phone all the time. And I've confided in my mum about that, because I needed a sympathetic ear. Thankfully she never once thought of contacting those people and telling them to be quieter on the internet because I was upset!", "Id unfollow ops posts"]}
