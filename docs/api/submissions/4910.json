Personally, what I think should happen is your sister should reach out to you and let you know that she loves you but she is feeling very sensitive at the moment and will be blocking your feed while she learns to cope better and wishes you well in your pregnancy.

But one caveat...depending on her relationship with her sister, I think OP should actually talk to her about this first. In this post, one thing that jumped out at me is that everything about sister's feelings is coming through the mom. I have no doubt it was tough for the sister to learn about the pregnancy while she struggles with infertility, but it doesn't sound like the sister has said anything about OP's posts at all. For all we know, the sister might be mortified to know that her mom was making this request on her behalf. OP also mentions favoritism, and that makes me wonder if mom has a history of pitting her daughters against each other. If possible within the context of their relationship, I'd suggest OP reach out to her sister in a compassionate but not patronizing way to see what she actually wants. Just a, \"Hey, I know this is a hard time for you, and you're in my thoughts. I'm happy to make sure posts about my pregnancy don't show up on your feed if that's helpful.\"", "That\u2019s a massive assumption on behalf of the sister though, even from her mom.

Is baby allowed to come? \n\nI get she has incredible pain. She needs help to work through that pain. Expecting her sister to accommodate her isn\u2019t right. Unfortunately life goes on and babies are a fact of life.", "To be fair, she doesn\u2019t even know her sister is in pain. This is based on how her mom thinks the sister might feel.

They aren't mutually exclusive.", "She shouldn\u2019t have to do anything because she isn\u2019t the one with the problem. Are you really this dense? OP didn\u2019t do anything wrong and owes no one anything. Her mom and her sister are the ones acting hurt they need to handle their own feelings and leave OP out of it.", "She\u2019s done nothing unkind. She is not rubbing it in her sister\u2019s face like \u201chaha I can get pregnant and you can\u2019t\u201d she is literally just posting about her own pregnancy, and sister and mom are making it all about sister. As adults we have to take responsibility for our own feelings and if sister\u2019s mental health is that bad over it she needs therapy because people are not going to stop being pregnant and having babies just because she can\u2019t have them. The world does not revolve around her. We can learn to cope with things like this that are hard, but sometimes we can\u2019t do that alone, and that\u2019s okay. Getting therapy to learn how to is a healthy way of doing so; forcing everyone around her to stop celebrating their own joys is not. \n\nNTA OP."]}
