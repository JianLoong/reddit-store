Personally, what I think should happen is your sister should reach out to you and let you know that she loves you but she is feeling very sensitive at the moment and will be blocking your feed while she learns to cope better and wishes you well in your pregnancy.

But one caveat...depending on her relationship with her sister, I think OP should actually talk to her about this first. In this post, one thing that jumped out at me is that everything about sister's feelings is coming through the mom. I have no doubt it was tough for the sister to learn about the pregnancy while she struggles with infertility, but it doesn't sound like the sister has said anything about OP's posts at all. For all we know, the sister might be mortified to know that her mom was making this request on her behalf. OP also mentions favoritism, and that makes me wonder if mom has a history of pitting her daughters against each other. If possible within the context of their relationship, I'd suggest OP reach out to her sister in a compassionate but not patronizing way to see what she actually wants. Just a, \"Hey, I know this is a hard time for you, and you're in my thoughts. I'm happy to make sure posts about my pregnancy don't show up on your feed if that's helpful.\"", "That\u2019s a massive assumption on behalf of the sister though, even from her mom.

Is baby allowed to come? \n\nI get she has incredible pain. She needs help to work through that pain. Expecting her sister to accommodate her isn\u2019t right. Unfortunately life goes on and babies are a fact of life.", "To be fair, she doesn\u2019t even know her sister is in pain. This is based on how her mom thinks the sister might feel.

Her mom and her sister are the ones acting hurt they need to handle their own feelings and leave OP out of it.", "She\u2019s done nothing unkind. She is not rubbing it in her sister\u2019s face like \u201chaha I can get pregnant and you can\u2019t\u201d she is literally just posting about her own pregnancy, and sister and mom are making it all about sister. As adults we have to take responsibility for our own feelings and if sister\u2019s mental health is that bad over it she needs therapy because people are not going to stop being pregnant and having babies just because she can\u2019t have them. The world does not revolve around her. We can learn to cope with things like this that are hard, but sometimes we can\u2019t do that alone, and that\u2019s okay. Getting therapy to learn how to is a healthy way of doing so; forcing everyone around her to stop celebrating their own joys is not. \n\nNTA OP.", "A few things to consider:\n- how much \u2018joy\u2019 does it give OP to post pregnancy updates\n- how much is anyone else interested in the updates (I suspect not many - the same as wedding updates)\n- how upset are the sister and mother\n\nI suspect that no one is truly interested in pregnancy updates from OP, that OP gets a kick out of posting the updates - and that her sister and possibly mother find them upsetting. \n\nSo it comes down to what OP values more: her ability to post re pregnancy / OP getting a rush out of posting - or her sister being upset.", "I didn\u2019t read past the headline. If your sister doesn\u2019t want to see your posts she can unfollow you. You are allowed to live your life as long as you\u2019re not rubbing her nose it it. Just be sensitive.", "NTA - if it bothers your sister she will mute you to not see your post. Congrats!", "NTA", "I could go on and on about how OP aint the asshole here. Instead ill make it short. It ain't your sisters pregnancy. I dont see how it hurts her. And OP ain't the asshole. The mom is for having the balls to ask that of OP", "Congratulations! Mine every single speck of enjoyment out of this new phase (& all of life) that you can. Take maternity photos if you want. Revel in every change and movement. Please don't dim your glow for anyone or anything. It's not an attack to be thankful for your blessings & celebrate NTA", "NTA, you deserve to celebrate this pregnancy and any subsequent pregnancy. It\u2019s unfortunate that mom played favorites. Be on your toes on how mom behaves as grandma to your child/ren; she could be an absent grandmother because it will hurt golden child\u2019s feelings or be great either way she will definitely put them after golden child finally has her baby.", "I have a daughter like your sister who feels bad when somebody else is able to have or do something she is unable to have or do. I really don't like her for it. I would certainly not favor her. I know infertility can be heartbreaking. Another daughter has that struggle, and, to be honest, we were worried she would have a baby before the first daughter I mentioned and that there would be drama as a result. I don't know if your sister is being that self-centered or if your mom is just favoring her that much. Either way, tamping down your joy over one of the most happy events of your life would be hurting you as much as your sister hearing about it is hurting her. Be sensitive toward her feelings. It is heartbreaking. But don't stop posting your happy feelings for fear her feel bads may be hurt. A lot of people in her friend's circle, coworkers, family, neighbors, etc. are going to have babies and be happy about it . She's going to have to learn to live with it . NTA", "NTA - I have had fertility problems for 8 years now and even though it's emotional and hurts - I would never want someone I love to not be able to post and be excited about such a wonderful time. Your sister could easy scroll past your comments and not pay attention to it. Also I think its important to understand that your sister wants you to be happy but she will have a difficult time processing her emotions. In my experience it hurts when you want something so badly that everyone can just (usually) easily do and then seeing it all over is difficult to deal it. Please be patient and kind with her and try to see things from her perspective BUT don't let that interfere with your most joyous time too. I wish you and your sister the best and a healthy relationship.", "That sounds like a her issue. I had two miscarriages and during that time, I gained 3 nieces. Not once did I deter from their happiness because afterall, I gained 3 nieces. You are entitled to your happiness. It is not your fault of it causes someone else discomfort. They can choose to unfollow you. Live your best life!", "NTA. But there is a small concession you can make: at the top of the post, you can adjust your audience to \u201cpublic, friends, etc\u201d. One of the options is \u201cfriends except______\u201d. Choose that and exclude your sister and mom from pregnancy posts. That way you can share your news with the world, without directly putting it in your sister\u2019s newsfeed. Your mom also misses out because of her lack of joy at your news.\n\nI can understand the initial tears and struggles for your sister- I\u2019ve been there. But you\u2019re not being pregnant AT her. Her infertility is unfair and tragic for her, but that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t ever get pregnant. She will have to learn to live in a world with other pregnant people. Your mom\u2019s coddling and favoritism won\u2019t help her with that. Your mom\u2019s lack of interest is more likely going to result in her not having much of a relationship with you or her only grandkid(s). \n\nShow a little compassion/concession for your sister by making the simple adjustment I suggested. When it comes to things like baby showers, consider taking her out for lunch and ask her if she wants to be invited/included or if that would be too hard. Celebrate your life and baby to be, but you can do so while still showing kindness and empathy to sister.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

I'm in a similar situation with a cousin. It sucks. \nFor the people suggesting OP limits/blocks what her sister can see.... that's a short term solution. What happens when the baby arrives? NC?", "NTA.\n\nYour mother and sister can always mute your account if they don't want to follow along in your joyful story.", "NTA. Dimming your happiness candle doesn't make hers glow brighter.", "NTA, it's your story and her decision to listen/read/follow. Talk to your sister and say you don't mind if she unfollows you for the time being - would be absolutely understandable. If you don't have that kind of connection just block her on social.   \n\nEDIT: If filtering is an option then go that route.", "Everyone deserves to be excited and proud of their pregnancy. Share away.", "NTA. While I understand trying to empathize with your sister I think your mom is way off base. Your sister has to accept the fact that she may never have children. Does your mother expect everybody who knows your sister to never talk about their pregnancies again for the rest of her life? That's absolutely ridiculous.", "NTA If sister is upset by your pregnancy posts she can unfollow them.", "NTA. Let's remember, you're probably not the only pregnant person that your sister knows. Is your mom asking every one of your sister's friends and acquaintances who are pregnant to stop sharing their news?", "NTA. just block them all on social media.", "There was this post once... OP had a baby, OP's sister was infertile. Sister refused to have anything to do with the baby. Wouldn't even go to family events if the baby was there. No children could be spoken of in sister's presence. The whole thing came to a head when their aunt had a birthday and sister wanted to go but aunt wanted OP's baby there as well.\n\nIt's horrible to go through that, it really is, but your sister has plenty of options to ignore you on social media *if* it's really bothering her (as others have said, you've only heard from your mother). And where does it end? Will she not be able to be around you when you start showing? Not want to know when you go into labor? Not want to see her nibling *ever* for as long as she lives?\n\nNTA OP, and I'm really sorry your mom is putting you in this position. You deserve better. And congratulations <3", "I'm all for filtering out sister and mom, but what happens when the baby is born?  Do you not get to bring your baby over for holidays?  Family get-togethers?  Do you pretend that the baby isn't there because it makes your sister upset?\n\nThis will continue to be a massive issue.  \n\nNTA\n\nCongratulations on your pregnancy, commiserations to your sister.", "I mean the request isn\u2019t very reasonable, but who really cares about your pregnancy except you?", "INFO: how often are you posting? Is it the normal amount of post like a pregnancy reveal than a gender reveal or maternity photos? Or is this an crazy amount of post like \u201cI\u2019m 16 weeks and 2 days today! My baby is the size of a grapefruit!\u201d And you post those little updates everyday?", "While I agree that filtering is an option, why should OP have to? Is mom and sister going to request certain things when baby is here, or for her to tip toe around sister for the rest of their lives? I can understand being empathetic, and not shoving baby/kid stuff down the sisters throat, but sister is going to have to learn to cope, because how will she handle seeing her niece/nephew in person?  The \"take a break\" option of Facebook would be a good idea, but they need to prepare sister for seeing her sister and the baby.", "I was just going to suggest this, but you were faster!", "Yep I would custom set to hide everything from mom and sister and her husband.", "Is she supposed to hide the baby too?  Leave the kid home until the sister has a kid too?    If the sister manages to have one, can OP then demand that sister be quiet about her kid then?", "Very true. I had had a miscarriage a few weeks before my sister announced her pregnancy. It was a shock and I\u2019ll admit I cried but I couldn\u2019t be mad at her joy even in my grief. I hadn\u2019t even shared the news with my fam yet so there was no point in bringing it up. I did end up talking to her later and confiding in her and she and I had a wonderful moment of understanding and empathy. I was luckily blessed a year later with my rainbow baby and now I have the two cutest boys in the world (son and nephew) in my life.", "Presumably OP has non-pregnancy related posts that sister would still want to see? Only OP has the ability to filter specific posts, afaik.", "Sister hasn\u2019t said anything- mom did. Blocking is more permanent and rift causing. Custom audience for posts is really simple and op can do it as a way to show a little empathy to her sister.", "Or even just mute her.", "Snooze for 20 weeks or so. But it\u2019s not going to go away. Soon it\u2019s a kid. And then kid updates.", "Yeah, this.", "Assuming OP's posts aren't 100% about the pregnancy, that would create a bigger gulf than just applying filters to those specific posts.", "Filter posts is a simple act of kindness.... block/unfollow without even knowing how the sisters actually feel without their mother meddling is a massive overreaction that would only cause more drama.\n\n\nThe sister didn't contact her crying or talked to her about her posts, it's all on their mom - could be very possible that the sister doesn't want to burden OP and have no idea their mom is being this overbearing in her name.", "Of course not. You\u2019re being needlessly dramatic. \n\nOP posting on social media is a *want*, not a **need**. It seems to be a *want* that is upsetting her sister though, so I\u2019m questioning whether it\u2019s really worth posting pregnancy updates, if the only + from it is OP getting an attention rush from it.", "Sister might very well already be coping. It\u2019s mom who shared the private info that sister had cried and it is mom who is lecturing OP.\n\nThis entire post is about mom\u2019s behavior- sister might not have any idea that mom is attempting to shield her from news on her future nibling.\n\nInfertility is a beast to deal with. Some hurt and jealousy is nature and normal and usually private. Mom is the one blabbing. \n\nI suggest OP meet up with sister for lunch and ask her what sister would like to hear about and would she like to be invited to things like a baby shower or is that too hard. It\u2019s a compassionate thing to do. Sister hasn\u2019t complained to or made any demands of OP. She evidently was either with or confided in mom that she cried once. That should have remained between them. I\u2019d be mad at my mom if she tried to guilt or silence one of my siblings\u2019 joy for my \u201csake\u201d. \n\nThe sun tends to be quick to assume the worst about people, but there is nothing in this letter that casts anyone in a bad light except the mom.", "It is sad OP\u2019s sister may not have children, but billions of other women on this planet will.  That\u2019s the reality.  Sis is going to have to get used to it.   And OP is one of those women.  NTA", "Speaking from experience, showing her sister that she understands that this is hard for her and giving her sister room to sit with those feelings and ask HER how she\u2019s doing is a lot healthier than constant bombardment. Odds are, her sister has unfollowed her profile already. Infertility is hard enough without someone who knows what you\u2019re going throw shoving pictures of the one thing you want in your face.", "So is she going to hide her baby the kid's entire life then?  Just block her completely for the rest of the child's life?  It's not \"nice\" to enable this.  It's unhealthy if what mom assumes is true.  Mother needs to butt out and OP needs to have a chat with her sister because all this information is second hand from mom.", "I have never understood the desire to limit another person's joy because I am not having all the life experiences I wanted.  The pregnant sister is sharing her joy on her social media .  If the sister with fertility issues cannot stand to see her own sister enjoy her pregnancy and share news with her family and friends, she can do the blocking.  Part of being an adult is accepting that you don't always get what you want, but life goes on regardless.  kt", "Shoving pictures in her face? Last I checked social media wasn't mandatory. Not everything is about her. People are allowed (& should be encouraged) to celebrate their joy. Bitterness is on the person spewing it.", "You are projecting here. Sharing photos and moments of happy occasion like a pregnancy isn\u2019t shoving it in people\u2019s faces. People are allowed to share joyous moments like this on social media without it being called bombardment.\n\nIf someone is triggered by that then, yes, they should stop following their posts. While I agree that OP should be caring towards her sister\u2019s feelings, she or the mother doesn\u2019t have the right to ask her not to post. \n\nAnd it\u2019s really up to the sister to handle her feelings of bitterness if she truly has them and not let it overtake her life.", "My wife desperately wants kids, and she gets a little sad when people share about their pregnancies on Facebook, but she would never say it's being \"shoved in her face.\" She likes seeing her friends happy. She just wishes she could experience that happiness for herself.\n\nIt's not like OP is purposely texting her sister every ultrasound and update.", "Yes! She could snooze her for a length of time."]}
