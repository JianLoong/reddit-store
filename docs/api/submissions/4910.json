Personally, what I think should happen is your sister should reach out to you and let you know that she loves you but she is feeling very sensitive at the moment and will be blocking your feed while she learns to cope better and wishes you well in your pregnancy.

But one caveat...depending on her relationship with her sister, I think OP should actually talk to her about this first. In this post, one thing that jumped out at me is that everything about sister's feelings is coming through the mom. I have no doubt it was tough for the sister to learn about the pregnancy while she struggles with infertility, but it doesn't sound like the sister has said anything about OP's posts at all. For all we know, the sister might be mortified to know that her mom was making this request on her behalf. OP also mentions favoritism, and that makes me wonder if mom has a history of pitting her daughters against each other. If possible within the context of their relationship, I'd suggest OP reach out to her sister in a compassionate but not patronizing way to see what she actually wants. Just a, \"Hey, I know this is a hard time for you, and you're in my thoughts. I'm happy to make sure posts about my pregnancy don't show up on your feed if that's helpful.\"", "That\u2019s a massive assumption on behalf of the sister though, even from her mom.

Is baby allowed to come? \n\nI get she has incredible pain. She needs help to work through that pain. Expecting her sister to accommodate her isn\u2019t right. Unfortunately life goes on and babies are a fact of life.", "To be fair, she doesn\u2019t even know her sister is in pain. This is based on how her mom thinks the sister might feel.

It will hurt your sister but if she loves you she will be happy for. Just be understanding if she can\u2019t completely share in your joy. Maybe suggest she unfriendly you for a while or stay off social media. Parents love sharing the joy of their kids. Also might be good for her to talk to someone.", "NTA. I\u2019m kind of over this whole \u201ceveryone has to censor themselves to avoid hurting feelings\u201d thing. You are allowed to be excited and it\u2019s rude that someone would ask you to NOT share it. Yes her situation sucks, but I\u2019d hope she would be happy to be an aunt more than she would be upset that she\u2019s not yet a mom. Her turn will come when it\u2019s meant to happen.", "If it affects the sister she should just snooze your posts for a while.", "NTA. I couldn\u2019t carry a baby to term, and now I\u2019m perimenopausal and single, so my chances are zero. This hurts, but I share the joy of my family and friends when they are blessed with a child, because I\u2019m not an A. Let\u2019s be clear: we share our joy, and there\u2019s no reason not to. If your sister loves you she will be happy with and for you.", "NTA. Unless you did something to make her infertile it\u2019s an unfair request. She should get therapy to learn to manage her feelings bc obviously she\u2019s not coping well.", "NTA. You should be able to express your happiness and excitement. The block/unfollow buttons exist.", "NTA - your sister can always unfollow your posts", "NTA - I am thankful I have my 3 boys.  But our journey to have them was filled with loss & plenty of tears.  After 5 years, 4 miscarriages, 13 IUIs & IVF we were finally successful.  But during the five years, I hosted a baby shower for my cousin & 2 for my sister because I wanted them to know that my journey did not stop me from being happy for them.  Hell, I watched my niece once a week when my sister was pregnant with twins & on bedrest.  A sister that never really wanted kids or could have them due to endometriosis & oops got pregnant twice while I struggled.  Babies were still being born.  Of course I had sadness & jealousy.  But at the end of the day, I was happy for them while being sad for myself.  In fact, it infuriated me when I found out anyone hid baby news from me.  So, if your sister is trying to make your pregnancy about her, she's the AH.  Your mom is the AH for asking you to hide your joy.  Your sister can unfollow or snooze you on FB.  And she can choose to be happy for you.", "Yes. Like.. soft NTA. Her sister could always hide her stories from showing up, but I also don\u2019t understand the incessant need to update people on every aspect of your life. But that\u2019s just me. Be happy, but stop assuming anyone else cares.", "I wouldn't try to sail around the social media posts with filter mechanisms. Pregnancies end, the child will be born. The sister will be confronted with her niece or nephew in person, and that's going to be 100 times harder than an ultrasound picture if she doesn't emotionally deal with the situation beforehand. The pregnancy is the ideal time to work her way towards that, hopefully with honest talks between the sisters, and less meddling by the mom.\n\nThe sister's going to be that kids' aunt, at the least she will see them at family gatherings, but ideally she'd want to be a good aunt and see them more often. The kid shouldn't be born in a state of guilt because their aunt can't have kids.", "It's probably more mom meddling out of worry than actually the sister not wanting to see it.\n\nBut the situation is difficult. I can empathise why the mother asked what she asked. She probably isn't aware of the filter mechanisms that social media offers. Infertility can be incredibly hard on mental health. \n\nIf you're close to your sister, I can recommend meeting up with her and actually discussing the situation hands on. Talk to her about how she feels about you being pregnant. Ask her to be honest, and accept it if she says it's hard for her. Make it clear that you can accept and understand that. I feel open honesty is the only way how you can go out of this as a family, stronger, and without having to paddle around the topic for years. Your baby is going to be born, she's going to be adorable and your sister will be her aunt. She needs to be involved, not avoided / filtered out. \n\nNAH in my opinion. Good intentions on every side,", "Nope they would not unless that was privacy selected.", "This is the best feedback.\nSome people get offended on behalf of others and make a mountain out of a molehill. \nCommunication is the most important thing and always hear someone's emotions from the source, not the grape vine.", "Honestly, thats what I get from it, but I figured that may be my predisposition since my mom also likes to start drama", "I understand it\u2019s hard but instead of op watching what she post the sister could just block the post until she works through it. The sister is wanting op to make all the changes and not changing things she could change herself.", "Lots of hugs and we\u2019ll wishes to you. It took me a few years after my first one as well. I\u2019m happy to hear you have a good support system"]}
