Your sister can silence your posts for the time being while she works out her feelings.", "Nta. But.. to be kind.. filter her and your mom out of the posts. Custom privacy settings are great.", "NTA \n \nI\u2019m sorry for what your sister is going through, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to hide your own joy and what\u2019s happening in your own life. \n \nIs your mom calling all of your sister\u2019s friends with kids and asking them not to post? Is she following your sister around to try and keep her from encountering pregnant people? \n \nYour sister should seek counseling if she\u2019s struggling to the extent that she finds this to be too much for her. I\u2019m so sad for her on that, but that is ultimately something she has to work through.", "NTA - You can post as much as you want. Your sister can read as little as she wants.", "NTA\n\nAre you supposed to hide the baby from your sister too?\n\nIt will never end.  \n\nWhile your sister cried for her own infertility that does not mean that she has a problem with your pregnancy.  It may just be that your mother is overprotective.", "NTA. Personally, what I think should happen is your sister should reach out to you and let you know that she loves you but she is feeling very sensitive at the moment and will be blocking your feed while she learns to cope better and wishes you well in your pregnancy. She should let you know that this is her problem and that she is not blaming you. She just needs some time to process her grief.", "NTA. She likely has a block button she can use if she doesn't want to see your posts.", "NTA\n\nThis is difficult for everyone I'm sure. I completely understand that this may be difficult for your sister but you shouldn't have to walk on egg shells. What are you supposed to do once the baby is born? Not post pictures, not bring the baby around?", "NTA I\u2019m sorry her first reaction to your pregnancy was worrying about your sister. You have every right to be excited and happy and post about your pregnancy.", "NTA 10 years of infertility here, it may hurt her feelings but that is not on you. She has to come to a place of peace about it and that does not involve you at all. I sometimes get sad when o hear other peoples news but that is 100% my issue to deal with. Enjoy the pregnancy and the baby!!!! Congrats", "NTA. This is an exciting time for you and it's your right to share that with friends/family on social media. If it's too much for your sister to handle, she can unfollow/snooze/mute you. I get your mom's concern for her daughter, but you're both adults and can deal with these things without mom getting involved.", "NTA. If you're triggered by social media stay off social media!", "NTA. Congratulations! You have a right to celebrate and share your milestone with others on your own social media.\n\nYour sister is responsible for muting you on social media if it upsets her right now. I hope she\u2019s getting the care and therapy she needs, without taking it out on you. Your mom is being overbearing.\n\nIn less than a year she\u2019ll need to deal with seeing your baby at family events appropriately.", "NTA.\n\nInfertility is awful, as someone who has dealt with it myself.  But you can't be expected to suppress everything that may be upsetting to your sister forever.  Your mom is being extremely unreasonable.  And shame on her for taking away a moment of your happiness. Your sister is going to have to come to terms with the fact that there will be a baby in the family shortly.  Should she never be exposed to your child? You can certainly filter she and your mom for the time being; it's not hard to change those settings.  But it's absolutely your right to celebrate your happy news.  And congratulations!", "NTA.  It is entirely your sister's responsibility to manage her own social media feed.  \n\nIf she needs to give you a 30 day mute, or unfollow you, or take a break from social media, she is absolutely allowed to do that.  If that helps her mental health, then she NEEDs to do that.  \n\nIt is not up to you to stop sharing the good things from your life because it upsets your sister.", "Don't feel bad, keep on posting.  Sis should be happy for you regardless", "Nta, Frankly this is kind of a nonsense problem because your sister and her husband can choose to hide your post with a click of a button.\n\nFeel free to laugh at anyone that makes that request.\n\nYour sister needs some therapy and maybe some time off of Facebook.\n\nAnd your sisters still able to have kids... just not biological kids. That option is there if she wants it.", "NTA!", "NTA. I am like your sister (infertile) and I was the only one who wanted kids. I am the only one to have fertility issues. My older sister who never wanted kids called me and told me she was pregnant. It gutted me, but i was genuinely happy for her (I did ask if it was a good thing. She was happy about it) and her husband. Why would anyone who loves you want to diminish your happiness over your child?  I attended my sisters baby shower, which was HARD. Maybe talk to your sister and let her know that you get that this is hard and that you appreciate her support during your pregnancy (but only if that\u2019s how you really feel). Your sister has the option to snooze you on social media. That\u2019s up to her.", "NTA absolutely not! Do not hide your joy! This is a wonderful and special time that should be shared with people you love! Of course your sisters struggles are tough! I do feel for her but that is no reason not to celebrate your happiness!", "nta - i find it sad that your own mother instead of beinghappy for you is more worried about breaking the news to your sister.  and then telling u to stop posting about it is not cool.  so when the baby arrives does that mean your mom will not be happy about being a grandma and showing love and support for your baby?  thats what i would be worried about becuase if and when your sister does have a baby will your mom then suddenly stop being a grandma to your child and show the love to hers?", "Info. How long ago was your sister told about her fertility issues? Also knowing she has fertility issues, did you tell her about your pregnancy or did you just start posting about it?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That\u2019s sad for your sister but she needs a therapist not you stopping your celebration. Your mom needs to advocate for her in a more productive way like suggesting therapy.

It can be kinda hurtful to your sister but she should be happy for you.

But instead of you no longer posting about your pregnancy on social media, she could just mute or unfollow you for a while.", "NTA. She is going to have to accommodate herself to the fact that other people have babies. You cannot put your life on hold for her. If she needs to stop following you on social media, don\u2019t take it personally.", "NTA. She is more than capable of blocking you and you are more than capable of blocking her from seeing this. I'm sorry for her infertility issues, but pregnant people are literally everywhere. Once the baby is here will you have to hide it in a cupboard under the stairs she is over? Is grandma going to be a good grandma to her grandkid? Also, it is entirely possible to become a parent without being pregnant. There are so many kids out there who need a home.", "NTA. I understand that your sister is struggling but she will have to come to term at some point with your pregnancy/child because there will be family meetings, photos of the child on Facebook in the future...", "Would this include photos once baby is here as well?", "NTA. You are allowed to be excited about your baby. It is sad for your sister, but she shouldn\u2019t be forcing you to diminish your happiness.", "NTA. Sucks for her but exciting for you. I'd just block her from seeing those posts.", "Meh\n\nOf course you can share but you should also be considerate\n\nRemember that how happy you are is exactly as sad as your sister is\n\nKarma has a way of evening things out so be careful about not being kind when you could be\n\nEven just a conversation with her acknowledging that you understand this is delicate and that you don't intend to hurt her and ask how much she would like to know or not beyond social. \n\nObviously her struggle is not over so don't act like it's in the past.\n\nJust making her feel seen and that her struggle is a huge thing is the mature kind thing to do. How your parents may have treated her vs you is certainly not her doing.", "NTA\n\nPersonally, I'd start filtering your pregnancy posts so your sister and mom are unable to see them.", "NTA. Infertility is awful but social media is a choice.", "NTA and everything you said is what I would have said. You can tell her you're happy to block her and your sister or they can stop following you on social media and won't have to know anything. Congratulations and what a shitty response to such a joyful occasion."]}
