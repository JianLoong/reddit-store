My FIL is a retired doctor, a GP to be precise. He is generally a kindly man and we haven't had issues the 10 years I've been with my husband.\n\nWhen I was in the third trimester, I noticed he made a lot of unwarranted and unsolicited comments with regards to my condition. For instance, I had gestational diabetes. He seemed to disagree with the advice of my (highly regarded) endocrinologist. Then he asked me when I was getting induced into labour and said I should be induced at 38 weeks because of my GD, age and that my placenta could degrade and result in stillbirth. I found that incredibly insensitive and told my husband that if he says one more thing about my body and our birth choices (which are entirely conventional, by the way, I ended up going into spontaneous labour right on 40 weeks and had a smooth delivery), I would have a word with him.\n\nToday he came to visit the baby. He asked me if I've started exercising yet. Both my husband and I were surprised and said no, and my husband added that I needed bedrest, on the advice of both my OB and physio. My physio advised half an hour on my feet per day, building it up gently and going for small walks with intense exercise from 6 weeks. FIL said he disagreed. Ok. Then he asked me if I've been weighed yet. That threw us both for a loop. We didn't know why that would matter. Not that it should matter but I'm a petite woman and have always been skinny. I look appropriate for one week postpartum. Then he said I should be careful about diabetes down the line. My husband asked him what that had to do with my weight and he said well you should look to getting back in shape. I saw red. I told him to keep his nose out of my body, and that I already had a team of doctors looking after me, and he wasn't one of them. He said I'm coming from the point of a concerned FIL. I replied that's even more inappropriate and that anymore unsolicited comments, I would consider not allowing him in my house. He looked taken aback but apologised, mumbling about concern and then left. He has a history of depression and looked very sad when he departed, which made me doubt myself.

Even if he meant well, the questions were incredibly invasive, inappropriate, and frankly none of his business. As long as you\u2019re listening to your doctors, your FIL shouldn\u2019t be trying to insert his opinion into your recovery plan. \n\nCongrats on the new addition to your family! :)", "NTA.\n\nHe may be a doctor, but he's not *your* doctor. Just keep telling him that you are not his patient, and that you don't want unsolicited advice.\n\n>He said I'm coming from the point of a concerned FIL\n\nHe's just trying to exert control where he has no authority to do so. I'd tell him to bugger off until he can treat you with kindness and respect.", "NTA The only things I wanted to hear anyone say after I gave birth is do you need anything from the grocery store, can I do your laundry and all you have to do it reheat this in the oven for 20 minutes at 325 degrees.", "Yikes. FIL needed to be put in his place. His comments were entirely inappropriate. It makes me wonder about his bedside manner with his patients. NTA", "NTA\n\nSo you\u2019re supposed to put his happiness above your own? You\u2019re postpartum last thing you need is postpartum depression. He can keep his comments to himself or he can stay home.", "Oh lord a GP thinking he knows better than your endocrinologist and OB\u2026\n\nNTA!", "NTA that is so sexist and out of line for him to make comments like that.", "NTA\n\nI'm so proud of you for setting and holding to boundaries. If he has hurt feelings, you are not responsible for managing his feelings", "NTA, but I disagree with a lot of comments saying his intent was malicious or controlling. I genuinely think he may be trying to help in the way he feels he can the best. Or at least, without further context I can't say his intentions were bad. The way you implied that you and your husband were surprised makes me feel like this isn't normal behavior from him. \n\nEveryone likes to feel like their professional opinion is worthwhile and desired, but he pushed too far. I don't think you're TA for telling him to stop, but I do think it could have been done in a more gentle way if he was genuinely just being overly vocal with unsolicited advice. To his credit, he also seemed to have genuine reasons for his comments too, not just \"hurry up and lose the baby weight so you'll be nice and housewife shaped\" or some drivel like that.\n\nEdit: guys, come on. I'm clearly not insinuating she should follow his unsolicited advice. It says right there that I think she was right to tell him to stop, but that his comments were coming from a genuine place of concern for her health instead of a malicious or abusive intent and that people in general want to feel useful in stressful situations (and this was how he felt he could be useful, even if he was wrong). Whether or not he's right isn't my place to examine, I'm just going on what OP has said about the situation and responding to the AITA question lol", "NTA,  He was completely out of line in his comments about your weight and he really should have left you alone with his medical \"advice\" when you were pregnant.  I don't blame you for getting mad and telling him to leave.", "Maybe head me out. He\u2019s seen you for 10+years now you all never had issues before this - him being a GP maybe he noticed something. I would ask him why is he concerned does he think something is wrong? Maybe he thinks you\u2019re sick? He might just be concerned. It sounds like y\u2019all have had a decent relationship for a decade!", "NAH - I understand some of this is invasive, insensitive and unwarranted - and you are well within your rights to convey that respectfully.\nI don\u2019t think he meant to be rude or insensitive especially if he has a history of mental health issues. As for inducing at 38 weeks on account of GD, my highly regarded Ob-Gyn had the same view not so far back in 2019 - the baby size can get bigger due to extra glucose floating around in the system and there can be other complications. I was still able to deliver my first baby naturally (although doctor was clear she was not going to wait beyond 38 weeks), while my second was c-sec due to being a breech baby.\n\nSimilarly, his fears for diabetes later are not unfounded. Moms with GDM have higher likelihood of contracting diabetes later in life and extra weight can become a catalyst. That being said, nobody wants to hear weight related concerns unless asked for, least of all, a new mom. Keep your distance and space until FIL understands boundaries.", "NTA - he is so massively out of line. Your comments were appropriate and necessary. He should not be doing this to anybody.", "NTA. He doesn't need to be your doctor. But, you could have set boundaries a little sooner and with more gentleness. It probably came from genuine care for you and wanting to be useful.", "NTA.  \nIs this normal for him? How is he taking retirement? \nDads can get hmmm, over involved.  Give him some grace.  I don't think anything he said was said with contempt or being pervish.  socially l awkward?  you bet.  He picked a role he was comfortable with in a situation where he was not comfortable.\n\nI am sorry he said that. I think he is worried and spoke from concern.  When you are used to being consulted, and then find yourself retired and only a dad or spouse you feel kind of lost.", "Absolutely NTA!! He may be a GP but you are not his patient and never asked for his input. He has not been treating you and as such it is highly inappropriate for him to disagree with your doctors. He needs to stay in his lane. I would be seeing red too. Do NOT apologize to him. He owes you the apology and then his silence.", "If it\u2019s true he was a doctor he had no bedside manner!  Part of taking care of people is having compassion and empathy. He has absolutely no idea what it\u2019s like having a baby and didn\u2019t know about your private medical details. Only a huge AH would say what he did.", "Just because he is a doctor doesn\u2019t mean he understands all of medicine. Also, there might be a lot of outdated info and procedure he is basing his advice on.\n\nWork with the doctors who actually have insight into your health and stand your ground with FIL. Last thing you need now is more stress.", "Unless there are some unusual medical indications, half an hour on your feet per day, building up, is ridiculous.\n\nLack of activity puts you at greater risk of post partum embolism.\n\nYour FIL asking about your weight and specific exercise is rude and out of order.\n\nHe is correct that gestational diabetes needs follow up.\n\nNTA", "My opinion is he was worried about you, your baby, his son, all of it.  With depression all the bad stuff that can possibly happen jumps to the forefront and he may feel scared for you. Maybe feeling helpless in a huge event in his son's life. Trying to help, give advice - maybe outdated, maybe not. Who knows? Maybe i'm entirely wrong about the motivation..... Definitely poorly chosen timing and words.... getting a 1 week post partum woman worrying about her weight?? I'd give him a smack! But I'd also give him the benefit of the doubt, especially since you've had a good relationship up till this. Congratulations on your new baby!!!", "NTA\nHe is not your doctor and he does not have all of your information\nYou never have to do what the doctor says (But you probably should when it\u2019s your doctor and they have all the information) and you certainly don\u2019t have to do what you FIL says\nMedicine updates constantly, so just because he was a Dr doesn\u2019t mean he knows the current best practice. \nIf FIL wants to give unsolicited medical advice he should just shout at the TV screen when someone is watching Grey\u2019s Anatomy.", "NTA, he was absolutely over the line", "ESH. It can be hard to turn off being a doctor, and often medical people compartmentalize things. He was thinking of you clinically like a patient. It doesn\u2019t sound like he was trying to be rude or mean, only concerned about your health. He needed to be told /reminded that you are following your doctor\u2019s advice and to please not comment about your health/looks anymore. A gentle approach would have been better to start with, and then get more firm if he persisted. I\u2019m a nurse and would also be annoyed at unsolicited advice, but can see where he was probably coming from.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think he is, either. \n\nI think you were right to tell him to mind his business re: your body. But since he was coming from a place of concern, I think you probably could have told him just TOLD him this was bothering you, and he\u2019d have stopped. It seems like you never mentioned it, so he kept going. \n\nI remember reading once that men and women have a hard time communicating because women talk about a problem to get understanding, while men think fixing is how to comfort (and vice versa). Obviously this is an over simplification but\u2026.I think he is just trying to be helpful and that\u2019s the way he knows how to help. He\u2019s trying to fix in the way he feels most helpful. Give the guy a hug and tell him no more advice about anything regarding your body.", "NTA and his behavior is so wildly inappropriate it would be safe to wonder if he is experiencing some type of dementia.", "NTA but as he is retired, i think he has no other \u201coutlets\u201d for his professional knowledge so foists it on others. If he is a generally kindly man, apologized, and doesn\u2019t repeat; then NAH. He may offer baby/child medical advice- quite typical for grandparents and even more so for GPs I imagine.", "NTA as no one should be commenting on your weight or health unsolicited, even if it is coming from a good place. \n\n\nFWIW I have had GD myself and am quite shocked if you weren\u2019t counselled about induction at 38wks  as your FiL is right about the risks. If you were counselled by your team and decided that this was the right choice for you then that\u2019s different of course.", "NTA. FIL is majorly overstepping. He\u2019s way out of line, and his advice about exercising one week after giving birth and commenting on your weight shows a complete lack of common sense.", "NTA.  He may have meant well, but that advice was pretty personal and unsolicited.  I could see him asking what your doctors were recommending, but I can't see him telling you any of this was wrong or giving you such inappropriate comments.  Follow your doctors' advice and maybe have your husband talk to him to curb the advice but find some other way for him to feel involved.", "NTA. I dislike it when people use their \u201chistory of depression\u201d as Carte blanche to go shitting on people.", "NTA\n\nFIL is way out of line. Highly inappropriate and unprofessional.", "Are people saying the FIL is not the asshole missing that the OP is one week post partum? He\u2019s totally TA for bringing this up with little tact-set and setting, omg. He\u2019s also not OP\u2019s physician & should realize to offer up his opinion if it is asked for in a conversation.", "NTA. he was not there to accompany you while pregnant or giving birth, means he is jon snow and knows nothing.", "NTA.\nI\u2019m glad your husband was able to stand up for you and you were able to stand up for yourself. As for your FIL there\u2019s a difference between being concerned and being inappropriately concerned. He needs to understand that he made you uncomfortable and has to apologize.", "Yuck. Honestly your husband should have said something before you even had a chance.", "I think scientists are like that. It doesn\u2019t sound personal.  It\u2019s unsolicited advice, sure, but he\u2019s sharing his genuine expertise.  I don\u2019t think any of it was to pressure you or from a bad place.  I think he\u2019s just being robotic like a scientist and not really thinking of your feelings. NAH.", "NAH. I\u2019m a type 1 diabetic myself, and unfortunately a lot of what your FIL said is true. Diabetics can have issues with their placenta in pregnancy, and are almost always induced early to avoid complications. Secondly, many people who have GD go onto having type 2 diabetes later in life. It\u2019s sort of a risk factor/warning. \n\nNow your FIL was never asked for his opinion, and I can absolutely understand your feelings of wanting him to shut up. He is in a weird position though. He has (correct) medical knowledge and is sharing it because I think he cares about you and feels an urge to say something. Sort of a damned if you, damned if you don\u2019t sort of situation.", "NTA! Doctor's aren't even supposed to treat family anyways, and he's coming at you unsolicited? He might be coming from a place of concern, but he still needs to stay in his lane.", "NTA- but my advice is to not read anymore comments and delete this post.\n\ncuz if you didn't want unasked for advice from your FIL who is not on your medical team , you most likely still don't want them from all the ppl in comments giving advice who don't know you or your medical history.\n\ndelete, and just concentrate on yourself, and your little family", "YTA. He was concerned for you. Just because you feel bad doesn't mean you can treat everybody around you badly.", "NTA he is an idiot, not concerned. More a knowitall.\n\nbut next time your husband could open his mouth", "NTA\n\nHe's not a doctor. He's a RETIRED doctor. This is important because, on top of the fact that older doctors are often behind in newer procedures, disciplines, diagnoses, etc., he's retired so he's not even getting the normal amount of exposure to this stuff as a doctor in the trenches. He was probably out of touch with the latest medical information when he was practicing, and is now that much more so out of touch. Maybe you could have been a bit more gentle about it, but what's done is done. If you're concerned about his depression, reach out to him and see if you can't both work to smooth things over.", "He is a bit offensive but he is giving advice as a doctor not trying to offend you. I wouldn\u2019t care tbh bcs he has no bad intentions and you know this. I would probably smile and say yeah I will be careful and tell him not to worry I do my check ups and go to the doctors. Now he feels hurt and sad and you don\u2019t feel better at all.\nI know in AITA most will tell you \u201cburn the bridges don\u2019t speak to him again\u2026\u201d like it\u2019s so easy to dismiss family and especially the parent of a spouse. I would advise you to call him and ask him to come back and have a civil conversation with him telling him calmly how it makes you feel and that you know he is just concerned but when he says these comments it makes you feel bad even if he doesn\u2019t mean to.", "He was a GP not a ob/gyn. Not to mention he is old. Medicine has changed and is slightly less misogynistic. You were wrong. Later if you want you could apologize for saying it harshly but your concern isnt looking fit right now its healing from giving birth and bonding with your baby.", "Nta he had some real bad advice, but also was kind of being a dick about it.", "NTA, a GP has to know a little bit about many conditions, but they should also know when to refer someone to a specialist. You have a team of specialists already who know what is best for you, it would also be a massive conflict of interests to have your FiL involved in your care, not to mention it's entirely inappropriate for him to be making any comments about your weight full stop but even more so considering you are only 7 days out from giving birth.", "NTA. Follow YOUR medical professionals advice. If you have concerns about the advice they are giving you then ask for a second opinion. \n\nYoure a better woman than i because i would have gone postal on him. \n\nCongrats on your new little one!", "He\u2019s a GP not an OB/Gyno tell him to mind his own business and don\u2019t talk to him anymore", "Well he does have a degree. But. If he makes you uncomfortable maybe if ignore? It doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s malicious. He seemed hurt when you called him out. So maybe just humor him superficially? Just for the peace. And you and your husband keep to your different plans.", "Does FIL live alone? Have you or your husband noticed other odd statements from him?\n\nNot exercising until 6 weeks post partum (minimum) was standard of care when I had my first in the early nineties, and wasn\u2019t some new standard then.\n\nCould your FIL have some memory issues going on? \n\nYou\u2019re NTA in any case, but such wildly inappropriate comments, with no basis in fact, could be concerning.", "It\u2019s a tough call for me. You\u2019re both the AH but understandably so.\n\nForgive each other.", "NTA. What a jerk, I\u2019m glad that you stood up for yourself. Also, your husband should have immediately shut him down. You\u2019re going through a lot right now and the last thing that you need to be dealing with is daddy\u2019s BS. I doubt that FIL is in perfect shape.

Get a spray bottle with water and use it on him the next time he acts so inappropriately.", "Um, he\u2019s not exactly wrong. Also my first baby with GD at 34: diabetes did not resolve. I was not fat and only gained 18 lbs with first kid.  Not being \u201cSkinny\u201d is not what makes you diabetic. Failing pancreatic beta cells and a placenta that keeps blood sugar high in the mom does. When I did get GD I panicked bc I had taken a class in my 20s with a very pregnant woman who had experienced a stillbirth due to GD.  My eldest came roughly two weeks early stripping membranes, I would have been induced at 39 weeks.  My second child was induced at 38 weeks.  Both babies born vaginally and normal size, 6 lbs 13 oz and 7 lbs 4 oz. I have now been diabetic for 19 years and insulin makes you gain weight fyi.  Highly recommend wfpb no oil for anyone of childbearing age who has insulin resistance and who is trying to reverse diabetes.  I think I started too late, but it does keep my weight more stable and I feel better.  Anyway, he sounds concerned and he\u2019s concerned about you.  Just tell him you\u2019re not his patient.", "Soft Yta.  He didn\u2019t mean harm.  You waited until you were really angry to say anthing and then you brought about all your guns.

Medicine has come a long way since then and back in the day that women should quickly lose weight to get in shape was hugely believed in like the 80s and 90s.\n\nYou could consider apologising for the delivery of your words but just remind him you know he cares however you\u2019d prefer to not have input or opinions on how you choose to manage yourself medically as you\u2019re relying on your own medical team for that. He probably feels very guilty and regretful. \nI don\u2019t think you need to apologise or regret what you said, but rather just smooth a way forward that won\u2019t damage the relationship while standing your ground.", "NTA He is wholly inappropriate and an example of medical bias and fatphobia.", "Good for you - MY MIL is the same way \ud83e\udd2e", "NTA at all. He definitely deserved what you said! I hope he feels sad, because he's an idiot!", "NTA.  His depression isn't an excuse to comment on your body.  He's not your doctor, he's a doctor.  You should look onto getting back into shape?  You just had a kid.  What's he expecting?", "Nta. This man has no right to be commenting on your appearance.

My FIL walked out and bought me a new Volvo after driving our previous car once. Didn\u2019t ask me what I wanted just handed me instructions to go pick up the new car. FILs take what they know and use it to show their care. He should have thought through his approach a bit more, and will have heard you loud and clear now. \n\nYou didn\u2019t really need to go off at him. Hormones are probably rampant right now, and it sounds like you have an unusually difficult recovery if you are on bed rest. (FWIW it is actually usual medical best practice to encourage walking and movement after birth to reduce risks like blood clots, improve circulation to reduce swelling and fluid retention and promote healing, so the fact you aren\u2019t allowed to even walk around says you have had a particularly heinous birth. A person who has a c section, after 12 or 14hrs of active labour is still expected to get up and walk a little the very next day.)\n\nYour husband should have pulled his father outside before he said something and said \u201cShe\u2019s very sensitive right now and please don\u2019t say anything to her about her recovery\u2026 no advice or comments at all.

But as presented, he needs to back off.", "NTA, my bil has the same problem. After he confronted my husband about his weight (my husband is slightly overweight, not obese) at a family dinner in front of everyone because he was \"just looking out for him\" and made my husband leave the room because he started crying (he isn't very confrontational) I just blew up at him in front of everyone. All my in laws agreed just my bil didn't see my point. He meant it would be important to talk about such things and he was just looking out for him from a medical point. I replied that if my husband would want his opinion he would have asked. The fact that he didn't ask him fro advice clearly meant that he didn't trust him regarding that point and that he can tell his opinion to his patients because they are coming to him because they want his opinion but that he shouldn't walk around and just tell everyone without being asked.

I think the advice was coming from a good place, he does have expertise and felt he should try to help you with the knowledge he has. Unfortunately it contradicts your own doctors and is putting unnecessary pressure on you just a week after birth. You said yourself he's a kindly man, so I'm sure his advice was meant in a caring way.

Which are not good odds. And diabetes sucks. It can be hard to control, and uncontrolled diabetes leads to overall significant health issues. \nOne of the ways to decrease your risk of developing diabetes later in life after experiencing gestational diabetes is to return to a healthy weight post-pregnancy, as well as being active. My guess is that\u2019s why he was discussing those points specifically. Is it appropriate? Still no, because he is asking you this in the capacity of a father in law, not your doctor. And his timing wasn\u2019t appropriate either. But as a healthcare professional, this is exactly the patient education that would be discussed with a postpartum mom that had gestational diabetes.", "NTA. At all. FIL is out of line in every way.

My FIL is a retired doctor, a GP to be precise. He is generally a kindly man and we haven't had issues the 10 years I've been with my husband.\n\nWhen I was in the third trimester, I noticed he made a lot of unwarranted and unsolicited comments with regards to my condition. For instance, I had gestational diabetes. He seemed to disagree with the advice of my (highly regarded) endocrinologist. Then he asked me when I was getting induced into labour and said I should be induced at 38 weeks because of my GD, age and that my placenta could degrade and result in stillbirth. I found that incredibly insensitive and told my husband that if he says one more thing about my body and our birth choices (which are entirely conventional, by the way, I ended up going into spontaneous labour right on 40 weeks and had a smooth delivery), I would have a word with him.\n\nToday he came to visit the baby. He asked me if I've started exercising yet. Both my husband and I were surprised and said no, and my husband added that I needed bedrest, on the advice of both my OB and physio. My physio advised half an hour on my feet per day, building it up gently and going for small walks with intense exercise from 6 weeks. FIL said he disagreed. Ok. Then he asked me if I've been weighed yet. That threw us both for a loop. We didn't know why that would matter. Not that it should matter but I'm a petite woman and have always been skinny. I look appropriate for one week postpartum. Then he said I should be careful about diabetes down the line. My husband asked him what that had to do with my weight and he said well you should look to getting back in shape. I saw red. I told him to keep his nose out of my body, and that I already had a team of doctors looking after me, and he wasn't one of them. He said I'm coming from the point of a concerned FIL. I replied that's even more inappropriate and that anymore unsolicited comments, I would consider not allowing him in my house. He looked taken aback but apologised, mumbling about concern and then left. He has a history of depression and looked very sad when he departed, which made me doubt myself. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA, but I do think you need to have a longer conversation with him in the future. Giving him the benefit of the doubt & assuming you got along well with FIL before this, he could have been coming from a place of genuine concern, but ended up an AH in how he showed it. He obviously doesn\u2019t/didn\u2019t understand about how his \u201cadvice\u201d would make you feel and 100% should have been called out for it. I\u2019m hopeful when explained how you & husband feel about what was said he\u2019d understand though.", "NTA. But just maybe he feels that he could be of use, or is feeling at a bit of a loss now he is retired?", "NTA but your husband is.  You shouldn't have had to tell off your FIL because his son should have told him to stop the inappropriate comments.  You even warned your husband and he still didn't open his mouth.", "NTA. I think he's jealous, but he needs to stay in his lane. Your life, your body, your choice. Love & enjoy your baba & try not to let others get to you. \nYou choose whose advice to take, or whose opinion matters.", "NTA. I wonder if FIL is just struggling to feel useful? You say he\u2019s retired, so my guess would be he was in his hayday at a time when conventional wisdom said that no woman should ever gain more than 15 pounds and she should lose it asap after birth. \n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, he\u2019s doing all this in the worst possible way and you\u2019re rightly poed. But maybe sit him down and stress how his info is outdated, how it\u2019s making you feel (like he thinks your appearance is more important than your happiness) and that he should be putting his energy into the relationship with the new grandchild. Good luck, op.\n\nETA maybe buy him a modern textbook if he\u2019s that bored \ud83d\ude06", "I had GD with my first son 8 years ago, and I was induced at 38 weeks so I'm guessing his medical advice is now out of date. I'm sure every case is different but I was petite with GD and 9 months after giving birth I did develop type 1 diabetes. But that wasn't linked to weight at all, I was very thin and working out wouldn't have stopped it developing.", "NTA, if anything you and your husband under-reacted. If my father said anything even remotely like that to my wife, he would be shitting teeth for a week.", "Nta", "NTA!!!!! I cannot stress this enough. You asked him politely but firmly more than once to butt the hell out and stop making HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE comments. He escalated it. You did absolutely nothing wrong. He won't get depressed from this - he's just very rightly humbled.\n\nCongrats on the baby. Enjoy the newbie stage and please resist pressure to lose weight against your ACTUAL doctor's advice.", "He\u2019s not your doctor, and he doesn\u2019t have full access to your medical records like he would as your doctor. If you are in the US, be sure that his name is explicitly NOT listed under people that can be given your medical information. If your physicians even work with the same hospital that he is associated with, have a conversation and be clear that your FIL is to be be given NONE of your medical information ever.\nAnd sucks that your FIL is prone to depression. But after growing up with a bipolar family member, being depressed doesn\u2019t give you an excuse to be an asshole and say mean things. It sounds like he\u2019s been enabled to say really rude things because the family is afraid of setting off a depressive episode (that FIL will guilt trip everyone into placing the blame on someone besides himself for said episode).", "NTA- He shouldn't poke the bear if he can't take the bear poking back.", "NTA and I wished your husband had shut him down way sooner, I can't believe he made that awful comment about stillbirth when you were about to have your baby, that is unforgiveable. \n\nIf he's going to remain in your life your husband needs to tell him he cannot under any circumstances discuss anything about your health. If he starts to then kick him out again.\n\nDon't feel sorry for him, in my experience arrogant bullies are often full of self pity.", "NAH \nIt seems to me he means well but is making a mess of things. You\u2019re totally right for calling him out. I understand you still feel guilty though. Maybe you and / or your partner can have a conversation with him about this when things have calmed down a bit. Tell him you already have a team of health care professionals looking after you but you only have one FIL and that\u2019s the role you want and need him to fulfill. Unless he\u2019s adamant on playing doctor (in which case I misread the situation and he is TA) he\u2019ll take this for the compliment it is and try to do better.", "NTA... I'm not sure how old FIL is, but you did say he was retired. Given that he's generally a kind man and you haven't had any issues before, I think several things are possible. It could be that he wanted to feel useful again, and that's how he knew how to \"help,\" that he has anxiety and is directing it toward you and the baby and legitimately worrying about things that are fine, or... is it possible that he could be showing early signs of dementia? One of the first early signs is sometimes what seems to be a lack of empathy, or saying things that aren't socially appropriate. My mother was also an intelligent woman (assuming FIL is, because he's a doctor,) and her neurologist told us that people with high IQ are often able to hide symptoms for longer, so it's not always apparent that they're struggling with memory problems. \n\nI know your first instinct is to be offended, because what he said is inappropriate and offensive. But also, you've known this man for a decade, and this is out of character, right? Maybe talk to MIL and see if she has any concerns.", "Isn't there a professional distance rule about doctors not advising family members? He's retired but should know better.\n\nAlso you have a team who are up to date and engaged in your care.\n\nOpinions are like arseholes. Everyone has them but no one wants to see anyone else's unless we ask.\n\nNTA\n\nCongrats on your baby", "Nta but regarding this \n\n>He has a history of depression and looked very sad when he departed, which made me doubt myself.\n\nask him to come over and talk. You like him usually, he probably means well but is out of line. Tell him your limits, your body is not a talking point - you will ask him if you want/needs his input.\n\nenjoy this time with hopefully only support from now", "NTA. You\u2019re better than me. I would have cussed him out instead of what you said. \ud83d\ude02 he\u2019s a jerk. Who shames a woman for her body right after she gave birth? It\u2019s not your fault you have GD. Jesus Christ. It\u2019ll go away soon I\u2019m sure and it\u2019s none of his business, wow. What a jerk. I\u2019m glad your husband helped defend you, though I wish he did a little more. Actually, way more, lol. But whatever. Your FIL sounds really mean and judge mental and it\u2019s not coming from a place of love and care, it\u2019s coming from a place of fatphobia and misogyny imo. That would be enough for me to go no contact with that man so you\u2019re a better person than me. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0fhe may be a doctor but he\u2019s still a weirdo for judging someone\u2019s body who just had a baby.

But having been though gestational diabetes and gaining tons of weight which now puts me at risk for diabetes \u2026. I\u2019d be glad if someone cared about me enough to bluntly tell me so. But that\u2019s just me \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. I would take a break from seeing him and your husband should tell him that his comments were entirely inappropriate and if he ever talks about your body again you will cut contact with him.\n\nI'm so sorry you were subjected to this kind of comments just after having a baby! Congratulations on your baby!", "NTA but it's hard for doctors to just switch off and not give unsolicited advice or opinions like this. He is not necessarily \"wrong\" per se either, he just has a different view than your OB. Could be some of his info is out of date if he's retired as well. My dad was a doctor so I do understand the scenario. Just reiterate your boundaries and be firm but kind (if you can). He means well and you did say he's been depressed. I know what it's like to be a sensitive new mum but I wouldn't torpedo the whole relationship over this. Maybe limit your own contact with him (he can see husband and baby) for a while.", "NTA and his mental health isn't your responsibility. If he feels bad about this, he honestly should because it's an awful way to treat anyone, especially family.", "NTA. It\u2019s actually good that you told him to knock it off because chances are he would\u2019ve kept going. Who knows what he would\u2019ve said next? It doesn\u2019t matter that he\u2019s a doctor. Just because he\u2019s a doctor, it doesn\u2019t mean that he knows you. You\u2019re not his patient. Plus, you didn\u2019t even ask for any of what he said. Not to mention his advice was also going against the advice from your own doctors. What he did was out of line. Medical information is private. Don\u2019t worry about being too harsh. You stood up for yourself and that\u2019s what counts. Hopefully he\u2019ll learn from this and avoid doing it again. Congratulations on the baby btw. I hope everything goes well for you", "NTA but you\u2019ve had a good ten yr relationship with him and know he has a history of depression so please don\u2019t lost your FIL over this one thing.  It may\u2019ve had nothing to do with you, like it could relate to his feeling less valued or useful after retirement.  Depression is common after retirement as well, especially when the person\u2019s job was a large part of their self-identity.  It\u2019s also hard for some people to turn off their professional thinking once they retire.  If it happens again you could tell him calmly that you already have drs and you want him to enjoy his retirement and just enjoy being a grandfather to the baby.", "NTA. Retired doctor means he\u2019s out of touch with the latest best practice.\n\nEven then, a GP would not know more than a specialist, which you have advising you", "NTA and he has apparently lost of bit of his bedside manner, though I don't know how well he ever managed that with family. \n\nBut if the offense wasn't intended and was well meaning then it is easier to write it off as old guy acting old, you presumably still want him in your life and do not want to hurt his feelings too much, you just want him to have some tact and not assume that he is the authority on all this stuff.", "NTA, but FIL isn't an asshole either. When people get older, especially after retirement, many struggle with staying relevant. To me it seems that he is just trying to connect and be helpful, but going about it wrong. Being a GP he is used to giving this kind of advice, it is hard to know when to stop. (This applies generally too, people have a tendency to look at the world through their own specific \"glasses\", seeing even the smallest things their knowlegde could be helpful with.) Does he live alone? Could he be lonely?\n\nSo you are definitely NTA, and I agree that he should not keep trying to GP you. But next time he butts in you guys could take a different approach. Maybe try to refocus his attention on something you really need help with (and is kind of up his alley), and ask him specifically for that. This way he can be occupied and contributing while the focus is not on you.", "Drs are known for being insensitive\u2026\n\nI will say though, depending on your age what he said about still birth and aging placenta is true - as per my OB to me ( age 40 and pregnant).  He gave me a study on it and strongly advised 38 weeks and absolutely no later than 39. He also mentioned stillbirth and was fairly adamant that this risk was to be taken seriously. \n\nAnd gestational diabetes often means your at increased risk of diabetes later\u2026. please do your research before discounting this information. This should have been told to you by your dr already. \n\nPretty sure my Dr told me to start walking as soon as I felt up to it\u2026 \n\n\nI wonder if your FIL is telling you these things more out of concern ( insensitive of course! ) but maybe he thinks your drs are not going their job well enough and thinks he should speak up? \n\nSaying this as you have had no issues in the past with him. I think he is insensitive, but likely only out of real concern. \n\nMaybe you can talk to him or write a note to him or have your husband do that. \n\nNo-one likes to hear negative health advice but it is important sometimes and drs mess up all the time and do not give the right advice. Maybe your FIL knows more than you think, just being a retired GP and all\u2026. And likely many years of all sorts of experience.  Would you prefer to be in the dark about certain health risks? Imagine if something terrible happened and your FIL did not tell you what he knows about the placenta. \n\nI am in the minority here, but please listen to me. Many drs do not do a great job, they are busy and they make mistakes. Your FIL only wants good things for you and baby and is far less likely giving you bad advice.  I think you need to apologize tbh.  His advice is lifesaving.", "Having many family members in the medical field there are little boundaries. Just tonight my nurse of a sister was talking opening about some gruesome details of her recent birth. My family was asking her questions about the current state of her stuff and comparing it to other cases. Me and my wife were just like cool cool cool we are going to pretend to not being hearing any of this. I had some pain in a private area and needed my sister to watch my kids while I went to the ER, that prompted a whole slew of questions about my condition. She also wanted to know what the Dr said afterwards.\nI can say my family means well, this stuff while being personal and private was their whole life. There is no shame in discussing it to them because it is as regular to  them as every day conversation. You FIL probably means well too. It is hard to switch off even if you are retired it is still part of who he is as a person. \nAlso as for the difference in opinion between him and your doctors I am not surprised by this. There are advances in medicine all the time and older doctors just aren't going to stay up to date. They will have a hard time admitting it or even recognizing it. In my line of work I am almost a dinosaur (I work in tech and I am not 20 anymore). My sister got into a huge argument with my grandmother once. My grandmother had been out of the game for 30 years while my sister had a few years under her belt. What my grandma insisted on as the correct Healthcare plan did not line up with current practices and she would not change her mind. It was a classic battle of new school vs old school. But that doesn't mean the youth have it all figured out. There are some things that have already changed back and my grandma actually had it right. Doctors are just people and people are some complex organisms that we are still trying to figure out. Give him a break but don't let him walk all over you either.", "He didn't mean well... he intentionally meant to be rude and hurtful.", "He's not even an OB!!!", "I would argue that even if he WAS her doctor, complaining about not exercising a week - A WEEK - postpartum is totally out of line. Oh, and way to ask or be concerned about any PPD issues, doc...", "I bet I know exactly what kind of GP he was, too.", "He's not even a doctor. He's retired. He had no reason to be telling OP what to do.  Id do the very same too!", "Yes this.   Let me clean your bathroom was another good one, plus the sainted friend who gave me foot massages.", "Plus he is retired. Even if he knows more than the regular Joe, his knowledge is outdated.", "My FIL is a semi retired physician (Neurologist) and I have several chronic illnesses, and have experienced the awkward 'trying to help, being a doctor, everyone asks me for advice anyway but I'm not YOUR doctor' type responses, and this sounds like that.\n\nI don't think it was malicious, but I do think there should have been more clear communication that you respect him, but really don't want medical input.  That was relayed to husband, not to FIL, and it really should have been a direct conversation.  From OP's perspective, it was last straw, but from his perspective it probably felt like going from 0 to 10 in an instant.", "Finally, a comment that makes sense. If OP has never had issues in the past, and had never said to stop before she blew up, he obviously didnt think his advice was unwanted, even if in reality it was weird. It's not that hard to set boundaries with people without being a jerk and I wish people could understand that.", "He\u2019d already been told to keep his comments and \u201cconcerns\u201d about her body to himself. So yeah, coming at your 1 WEEK POSTPARTUM DIL with the same bs seems pretty malicious to me.", "I\u2019m sort of baffled by that bit too especially for an otherwise \u2018smooth spontaneous (full term) delivery\u2019.\n\nExercise is usually on hold until after the 6 week PP checkup but \u2018half an hour on her feet/working up to more\u2019 seems super unusual too, so I could see why FIL would be confused and think there was some misunderstanding/miscommunication.\n\nHe\u2019s not \u2018wrong\u2019 about possibly developing diabetes as 50% of people who experience gestational diabetes go on to develop type II later on\u2026so those who experience GD **are** at a higher risk and advice is usually to lower that risk by returning to a healthy weight post pregnancy.\n\nI think there\u2019s possibly missing details or miscommunication at play?", "Yeah I\u2019m so confused on the 30 minutes in your feet per day. \n\nHow is she taking care of that baby? I get it\u2019s just one week post partum. But like is she getting up to feed herself, get diapers, wipes, outfits, showering, if she\u2019s formula feeding she has to be up to make the bottle", "She didn't ask for advice about her weight, there was nothing for him to fix. Telling a woman one week after she's given birth that she needs to get back into shape is incredibly inappropriate, insensitive and offensive. It shouldn't need to be said and she clearly wasn't expecting it. I would not be hugging someone who made me feel awful and judged about my body straight after giving birth, he's the one who needs to fix it with her. In no other context would it be appropriate for a father in law to tell his daughter in law she's looking fat and needs to exercise, but for some reason society thinks it's fine for everyone to comment on pregnant and post partum women's bodies and judge them.", "What? That's a ridiculous jump. He's being overbearing sure, but to jump to dementia?

GD can increase your chances of getting it within the next five years after birth, and babies risk of developing it increases by 6 times. I know because I had GD and my doctors told me to get back to running and hiking when I was healed from birth. \n\n\nBut on the other hand, it is not his job at all to be asking/telling you such things especially in such an insensitive way. \nI would be angry too. \n\nDefinitely NTA.", "NTA for you but slight ESH from your husband. He should have said something when his dad first.made a comment, to try and avoid future issues", "NTA, the only thing i wouldve done differently is said something to him sooner. when he first started making comments your husband definitely should have told him that he needed to be a grandfather, NOT a doctor on this one.", "NTA. He wasn't \"concerned\". He doesn't understand post partum and thinks you can spring back magically. Hollywood has a lot to answer for.

You set your boundaries. He is the asshole. Depression does not allow you to be an asshole", "NTA omg he needs to get his nose OUT of your business. If he can't respect boundaries, he might not even get a relationship with your kid! This is the last thing you need ATM, also where's his concern for your mental health and the effects of his words?! \n\nIf you wanted help, you'd ask for it, but you've rightfully chosen your own trusted people. \n\nI feel for his actual patients because this is inappropriate to say to anyone post partum.\n\nThe only time he gets a say in your health is if you literally go into an emergency situation right in front of his face and he's the only medical professional.\n\nI'm so sorry - also congrats on the baby!", "NTA. My Mum is a clinical counselor and draws a hard line when it comes to treating or diagnosing family, even if they ask her to. \n\nUnsolicited clinical advice is beyond the pale, unless it's imminently life or death (like if someone has expressed suicidal ideation, in Mum's case). \n\nThis is crossing not just a personal line, but a professional one. FIL needs a refresher in basic healthcare professional ethics.", "NTA. He is being absolutely offensive and extremely inappropriate. He is not your physician and need to know his place. I'm actually astounded at the audacity. Commenting on your weight and giving you very bad advice is really bad. I'd be livid and plbe petty enough to go no contact at least temporarily. It's standard to wait six weeks and he's telling you to work out at one week. Just insane.", "Is he exercising? I mean, to keep his depression at bay he should exercise daily. Medical consensus nowadays, minimum several times a week.\n\nFeel free to ask him.", "NTA he has very outdated medical advice and was clearly not an OBGYN", "Some men just feel entitled to comment on womens' bodies.  NTA.  If you aren't in shape/desirable then what's the use of you?  The fact that you haven't dropped the baby week a whole 7 days in should be a wake up call for you.  /s", "NTA, and indeed inappropriate. But, maybe he is in the first stages of forgetting, dementia? Those first stages that are hardly noticeable - although I suspect the person him(her) self may notice. Still, behavior should be corrected, but may be tempered by some empathy?", "NTA, he needs to learn a better bedside manner for life, he sounds like an absolute tool.", "NTA. Similar situation for myself at the moment. My GF (32F) is due in 6 days. She\u2019s had various unsolicited comments from family throughout. It\u2019s odd. \n\nI have also found that pregnancy advice has changed a lot and recently. Advice me and my GF get is very different to advice from when our parents had us. It\u2019s even slightly different to advice GF\u2019s sister got 2 years ago. That might account for his differing views on things. It doesn\u2019t excuse the ways it\u2019s been said. \n\nIt might be tricky but I think you could offer an olive branch that you don\u2019t need another doctor right now for a FIL but you do need a Grandfather for your new born. There\u2019s a part of him that just wants to help and being a medical professional he\u2019s fallen back to that all be it in a insensitive way. \n\nCongrats on your baby.", "No, not at all.

I, on the other hand, would've thrown something at him.", "NTA he should have respect you and your husband boundary\u2019s alongside the other doctors choices", "He sounds like a doctor who lets misogyny dictate his medical expertise", "NTA,\n\nAnd your husband needs to step up here and speak out and protect you.\n\nTalk with your husband and work out ways to enforce boundaries in the future.", "NTA\nHe's rude and is sticking his nose where it doesn't belong.

Maybe you were a bit harsh with him, but if you hadn't nipped it in the bud he would have continued with the unsolicited advice.", "Congrats on the birth!\n\nSolid NTA here. He\u2019s not your doctor and should stop acting like it.

You just gave birth to a human being. You are still bleeding for goodness sake. People REALLY need to keep their nose out of other people's health. The \"concern\" is fake.

He thinks you've welcomed his previous advice, so why would you suddenly react like this?\n\nAgain, NTA, but you've had this frustration building for months from his appallingly invasive behavior. For him, this came out of nowhere. So, I imagine he was shocked but I think he'll get over it. He also probably feels guilty for making you uncomfortable for months.", "If my husband wasn't an only child, I'd ask if we were connected somehow! \n\nMy FIL is also a retired GP and OB/GYN so I fully understand the medical opinions he may have on your care. Unfortunately for GP's who are retired or about to retire, they stopped learning after a point of time and have not kept up to date with the latest medical research. Women's health is also an optional unit to study but as of next year, all new Doctors will be mandated to study it.\n\nThere are a number of factors that contribute to GD such having a boy, the bio dad being older as well as if your mum had it all puts you at greater risk.

I remember my Dad raising his eyebrows at my weight gain at one point and he also thought my breastfeed babies were too fat and being over fed because he was trained on nice steady graphs as a guide. \nI didn't really take it personally as I realised it had been a long time since he was trained and he was concerned out of  care for me. He also didn't go on about it.\nIt's quite difficult for retired medical people to switch off their background level of monitoring other people's health, especially as people tend to tell them about symptoms etc. I think it can actually be a bit of a mental burden they never quite get away from. I no longer share health niggles with my Dad as he ends up worrying ( they remember all the bad outcomes they witnessed).\nSometimes it's annoying but every now and then it's useful. My 80+ Dad caught his equally elderly neighbours sepsis in time recently after his symptoms niggled at my Dad until he insisted he go to Emergency dept rather than wait to finish the course of antibiotics prescribed by his GP.\nI'd cut your FIL some slack but also avoid discussing specifics with him if you can in future.", "Nta,the asshole.", "NTA  \nYou should never have to yessir his patronizing, disrespectful, uninformed and therefore dangerous know-it-all shit just so he isn't \"sad.\"  \nSigned, a history of depression", "Please tell us the relevant medical information.

My GM delivered a full-term stillborn son due to GD and it was devastating. He may have experience with that as a GP\u2014or maybe even as a husband and father. Also, many women are up and moving a week after birth so if he didn\u2019t know your doc had recommended otherwise, he may have noticed and had legitimate concern\u2014but telling you what to do vs. inquiring if you are ok was def not the way to go.\n\nNAH, but I\u2019d honestly encourage you to reach out and ask if his concern about diabetes stems from something in particular.

Medically, your FIL is right about absolutely everything.  You should have been induced at 38 weeks, due to your gestational diabetes.  You took a risk going to 40 weeks, and luckily, the baby was fine.  You do need to be aware of the likelihood of eventual Type II diabetes for you.  Keeping your weight down, and engaging in regular aerobic exercise will help to delay it.  So your FIL is only speaking out of concern for you and his grandchild, and he is speaking TRUTH.

I\u2019m a physician. \nSome points I think your FIL was trying to make but didn\u2019t communicate well AT ALL:\n\nGestational diabetes causes large babies and risky births. A lot of folks get induced early due to their 10 lb babies they often birth. They and babies have complications during labor and postpartum period. He actually gets a pass on the first comment. He wasn\u2019t wrong. His delivery of it from your account sounds awful though. \n\nNow, the second comment \u2026 \ud83e\udd2f\nYou are at small risk to develop type 2 diabetes later in life due to having gestational diabetes. Key words: later on. A simple mention of that would suffice if he felt the need to spread unsolicited medical advice, but the way he put it was bizarre. Being overweight is a risk factor for this. To even mention anything weight-related to a woman that is 1 week post partum is insane. He sounds like he\u2019s from the generation of docs from the 80s that put pregnant women on diet pills to prevent them from weight gain during pregnancy. Yea, that was a thing. \n\nI\u2019m sorry your retired FIL is stressing you out. I honestly don\u2019t think his internet was malicious based on your description of his reaction, just the delivery of info was atrocious.

Chill out.", "NTA\n\nNot only because he was insensitive and inappropriate, but also because as a doctor, this is absolutely wrong of him to do.\nI'm a medical student, and the first thing they teach us is to never diagnose, give advice, agree or disagree with a medical decision without having the patient in front of our eyes and giving them a full exam, because every case is different, and any small thing can change the diagnosis entirely, and having test results or past medical diagnosis isn't enough.\nYour FIL isn't your doctor, he never gave you an exam nor did he have access to your medical records and test results, on what ground was he giving you advice? He gave you the advice given in a standard situation that rarely ever applies without changes. This isn't right, and can actually make things more difficult for you on the way, having early or late induced labor can be dangerous, and exercising before your own doctor's allow you or beyond the Boundaries they specified too can harm you very much.\n\nAlso, the decision of WHEN you decide to get back in shape simply doesn't concern him, not only is it not his body to make decisions for, but he also isn't the one sleeping with you, if you are fine and your husband isn't even upset about it  then why would he find the need to mention it?

I too would see red if a relative would even come out with such nonsense. Yeah he's a doctor, a RETIRED one at that but a) he clearly has no idea about pregnancy or birth and b) instead he'd be more supportive if he asked: what can *I* do to help? He could offer to cook or bring food, do the laundry etc. \nMy MIL is a nurse but not once did she offer unsolicited medical advice.

Ive dealt with old folks basically all my life and the one thing they all have in common is they just cant help themselves, like a grandma tryin to shove food down your throat, they all have these feelings they cant help but act on.", "YTA. It clearly sounds like he wants to help and didn't get the memo that it wasn't wanted. If this was the first time you clearly and firmly asked him to stop then you needed to communicate it without threatening him.\n\nIt is understandable that things got heated, especially given the circumstances. I'm sure it will be readily forgiven, but that doesn't excuse the behaviour and if you really said that you wouldn't allow him in your home I'm sure he will not forget that moment as long as he lives.", "He probably is concerned. And yes, he is out of line, but I don't think he means to be malicious or rude. My aunt is a retired GP and she still has the habit of mentally running through symptoms and diagnoses, and does ask questions and give (unsolicited) advice. But she tries to be careful not to overstep, and I'm generally reassured by her opinion (very occasionally it is different from my doctor's opinion, and when it's different she's often the one who is right. But I digress. That's my aunt, not your FIL).  \nI don't really want to call anyone the asshole here. Some of that advice was current when I had my last child only 8 years ago and I don't know if it has changed since then. Different countries update their advice at different times, too so it might be current in my country but not yours.  \nOf course he should be reassured that you are taking good advice from your doctors but maybe he's finding it difficult. He's anxious about something he has no control over. Maybe ask your husband to have a chat to him and see where his head is at. If he is generally kind and you get along it will probably blow over.

And make no mistake, he's trying to help in the only way he knows how.\n\nI've worked for doctors in their office. Part of the job is always taking care of their families, and they always come in after hours. I assume he's told them they can do that. \n\nThere's also the \"clingers on\" that want free medical care, free narcotics, free samples of drugs such as the poppers and sex drugs. I know some of this goes on in some medical offices after the staff leaves. Depending on the individual doctor, part of the job is telling people \"no\" when they try to make a pest of themselves. And there is always people trying to see them for these reasons. \n\nWhile you are right to maintain boundaries, I suggest you consider being kind.

Especially after his behavior when you called him out.  \nSometimes exercise is just getting up and walking which for most is encouraged post delivery.  \nAs long as he doesn\u2019t do it again, I would let it go.  You will prob need him with the baby.

With such support I  strongly believe everything will work out splendidly.\n\nI know a lot of commenters really laid into your FIL. I can't tell from your original post whether your FIL was a meddlesome sort prior to your pregnancy or became so when you became pregnant. I only inquire because it may reflect his intentions at the time.\n\nThere's no question he WAS WAY OUT OF LINE. You handled it well. Going forward, if he remains problematic, let your husband handle his father; saving you any unnecessary stress.\n\nHowever, it doesn't look like it will be necessary. It appears your FIL, regardless of how clumsy and misdirected he was in his questions and advice(frightening, actually),  really was concerned for you. Thankfully the dilemma has passed. And thankfully, he's retired!(Lol).\n\nContinued best wishes in your recovery and enjoy parenthood! You've more than earned it.", "He was not her doctor. He was not aware of her medical history or labs. It's extremely unprofessional of him do give such advice without even  knowing her labs. The fact that he is desagreeing with specialists that are aware of all her medical history is just insane. I am not a doctor but everyone know how dangerous it is to give medical advice without knowing the full picture. \n\nSo yes, he did this to be controlling not to help.", "How was it sexist??????", "If her doctors told her this, the maybe she has unusual medical indications.

This was the first time they had that discussion.", "My experience is so different. I had multiple nurses in my extended family and they would never offer a medical opinion for family. They were taught it\u2019s not their place. We\u2019re talking women who are now in their 70s, so maybe they were trained differently. But still.

It's the biggest anal mistake lol", "While it is a fact that poorly managed GD can have adverse effects on the placenta and other things, that still didn't give him rights to butt in like that... especially considering the fact that she was under the supervision of TWO specialists who were current in their training on such matters in how to handle those things. \n\nI think the only time it may have been warranted to voice some concerns would be if she were attempting unassisted pregnancy/ birth and not seeing any doctors whatsoever and he saw the clear signs of GD, etc... at that point, he should still have approached in a much more respectful manner and backed off when told his advice wasn't wanted.", "His advice was wrong because he's not her doctor.

His concern about being induced early is also legitimate - I remember hearing about possible links between the placenta breaking down early and GD at that time.\n\nIt sounds like in that case, he was genuinely worried about her.  I can understand that unsolicited medical advice could definitely rub someone the wrong way, and at the same time, he\u2019s correct that there be very serious complications from GD.", "Unless there was surgery or a traumatic birth, postnatal women are not disabled. I was not referring to sports training, just to regular movement around the home and garden/yard if lucky enough to have one, with occasional strolls, plus opportunities to rest and relief from household chores if possible.

Moving around is good!\n\nWhen women were confined (it was called confinement) to bed for 10-14 days, a proportion died  from pulmonary embolism as well as going mad from the restriction, less so nowadays.", "You have zero basis for that statement. Here is the advice from the American College of Obs and Gyns:\n\u201cWhen can I start exercising after pregnancy?\n\nIf you had a healthy pregnancy and a normal vaginal delivery, you should be able to start exercising again soon after the baby is born. Usually, it is safe to begin exercising a few days after giving birth\u2014or as soon as you feel ready. If you had a cesarean birth or complications, ask your ob-gyn when it is safe to begin exercising again.\u201d\n\nSauce: https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/exercise-after-pregnancy#:~:text=Usually%2C%20it%20is%20safe%20to,soon%20as%20you%20feel%20ready.", "This is a woman in her 70\u2019s, lol.

Science has advanced and his knowledge is outdated.", "I sure wouldn't want this fatphobe as a doctor", "I was lucky enough to have a family medicine GP for a dozen years that would actually listen to her patients. If you self diagnosed she too that to heart and believed you. She realized very quickly I was very in tune with my body and I was correct 90%+ of the time when I self diagnosed! Sadly she retired right as COVID started. New doctor isn't quite the same.", "I had GD with my second.

Good luck hun, I mean it.", "That's how I felt in my own body. 180 on my frame is obese, which caused a litany of issues with my knees and back, I couldn't reach my legs to shave them, pregnancy caused my hair and skin to get ridiculously greasy so I was constantly broken out and my hair never looked clean no matter how many times I would wash it.. so yes, I was disgusting and felt like a blimp because I was quite literally blimp shaped at that point. No need to try to get offended by extracting meaning that isn't there from a reddit comment, it's completely unnecessary considering I mentioned how prior to pregnancy I was extremely petite so I was, in fact, obese at 180.
