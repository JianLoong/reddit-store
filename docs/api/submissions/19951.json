You consider the situation important enough to make a two-hour drive on your daughter's behalf should she disregard your advice and stay for the final song (she will, she's a teenager, and she's with her friends).

So I can understand your frustration with teenagers planning to fail, like teenagers so often do.  \n\nBut there's at least two reasons I judge you harshly.  If you will drive to pick up your daughter, it would be a true AH move to let her 2 friends who are at the same location get stranded there.  And you are motivated to do that for your daughter's safety.  So what does it say if you don't care if other teenagers are in danger when it would take almost no effort on your part to correct that?\n\nThe other reason I say YTA is, it seems everyone missed the obvious solution.  \n\nTraveling late night will always involve some degree of risk, whether it's by rail or by highway.  Is there not a cheap hotel near the concert where the girls could crash out for a few hours and catch a train the next morning?  That would be the obvious solution.", "eh. Kinda yeah, if you do that ESH (except your kid). Look I'm all for letting kids figure shit out on their own and have consequences for their actions, but how late are we talking here, how old are they, and what do you think they are going to do?\n\nI think in general, but especially as a parent, you do actually have a moral obligation to keep minors safe, especially your child's friend (yes their her friends, the quotation marks are weirdly passive aggressive of you. If she says their her friends then they're her friends. Even if their dicks). If your driving down there to get her anyway, and yet you intentionally leave a bunch of teenagers far away from home at night I'm gonna have to call you an AH. That's just dangerous and yes would be unethical.\n\nFind out their plan. If they have another way home though, even if they have to pay for it, then you can feel justified in leaving them there.", "YWBTA. If your daughter needs a ride, just deal with her friends and drive them too. It\u2019d likely be better for your daughter that way, plus a bit safer for the other teenagers. You can stay resentful", "YTA if you drive down and don\u2019t pick up the other two.  I don\u2019t ever leave an event early unless Illness or  emergency.

Maybe just plan on driving them as a nice thing to do? Missing the last songs of a concert is big ask for teenagers, even though as an adult it doesn't feel like a big deal. And picking them up ensures their safety after the concert.", "Jeez, don't tell them to go eff themselves. You don't need to be so nasty. It's not bad that they don't want to miss out on the whole concert. I understand not wanting to have to pick them up. But just because you're resentful don't be nasty and humiliate her daughter in front of her friends.", "Yes YWBTA. \n\nWhy not plan an evening for yourself? Let them ride the train down and meet them after the concert or drive them there, go do something yourself, then drive everyone home.", "YWBTA if you go pick up your daughter and leave her friends there. Doing so will have the friends' parent's angry with you, likely the friends angry with you, your daughter angry with you, and likely irrevocably fracturing the friendship between your daughter and her friends (although considering you put friends in quotes, you would be quite happy for your daughter to lose these friends). You may have to accept that your daughter will be traveling back on the train alone (assuming, of course, she willingly follows your instructions and leaves the concert early). Here's my suggestion, tell you daughter that if she isn't willing to miss the last song (assuming the concert does go that long) or ride the train back without her friends, she needs to plan to get a hotel for the night and come back the following morning (with or without her friends). Also, contact the parents of her friends and let them know that you have suggested this course of action since you have no desire to have to drive 2 hours round trip to collect a bunch of teens just so that they get to see EVERY song of the concert and therefore miss the train back and have no means of transportation home and possibly no safe place to stay overnight. This may get one of the other parents to be the ride or get them to force their own children to miss that last song as well.", "YTA\nThe concert hasnt happened yet?

A terror attack can happen anywhere, you can\u2019t really avoid it else you\u2019d never go anywhere.", "YTA. How are teenage girls not wanting to miss the last song of a concert \"acting like pricks\"? They are just excited teenage girls. They aren't conspiring to make your life difficult. Talk to the other parents and arrange for one of you to pick all the girls up when the concert is finished. This hardly seems like a huge trial and is a just part of being a parent.

It'll make your daughters life easier to not start drama with her friends", ">Is it unethical/am I being petty if I drive down, collect my daughter and tell these other 2 who can't follow basic instructions to go fuck themselves?\n\nShort version:\n\nYes, YTA if you leave two 17-year-olds stranded in central London late at night with no obvious means of getting home.\n\nLong version:\n\nYou sound like a great parent who is trying to help your daughter become independent, and I really respect that. On the other hand, teenagers get into scrapes sometimes and part of being a parent is bailing them out. It sounds like you've accounted for that possibility and are ready to step in for your daughter if needs be. Not every teenager has great parents like you though.\n\nMy dad was always \"taxi service\" when I went to parties etc in my late teens, and I lost count of the amount of times he'd drive miles out of his way to drop drunk people home who were otherwise stuck, simply because they were my friends and I wanted to look out for them. Sadly he passed away when I was 19, but the friends I'm still in contact with from my teenage years all remember him as being a guy who would treat them like they were his own kids. Even now, I'm still that person who will give someone a lift to get them out of a scrape, even if it disrupts my plans a bit, because dammit it's what my dad would have done.\n\nI had a point, I promise.\n\nYou don't need to plan everything in advance with your daughter. Leave her to sort herself out, but let her know that if the shit hits the fan, she can call you and you'll come, no questions asked. It might be that she and her friends figure it all out anyway. But if she calls you and you say \"sure I'll pick you up but not your friends\", several things might happen:\n\n1) She says \"fuck you, you don't care about my friends, I'll sort myself out\" and gets into a worse scrape\n\n2) She agrees, but by leaving her friends stranded you've now driven a wedge between them because they'll associate the shit situation with her (rightly or wrongly)\n\n3) She agrees, but upon arriving and seeing them stranded you let them come anyway, which paints you as someone who can be manipulated by her friends.\n\nOn the other hand, if she knows that calling you means everyone gets home safely, she will do so if she needs to without fear of any negative consequences. And I include the \"no questions asked\" part in that. If you think a few days down the line that there's an issue which REALLY needs bringing up, do it then, NOT on the car ride home where she might already feel guilty for dragging you out in the first place.\n\nChances are, what will happen is that if you end up picking them all up, they will all think \"gosh we'd have been in a right mess if OP hadn't picked us up\", your daughter will have the opportunity to say \"I told you so\" re: leaving early, and they'll all be slightly wiser for it.", "YWTA, like obviously? you're the adult. you know better than them what can happen when young girls are out alone at night.\n\n17 y/os are gonna do stupid shit. If you truly think this is gonna happen, don't let her go and tell their parents. If you let her go and they call you, be the fucking adult and bring them home.", "If you collect your own daughter and leave two other people's daughters in London with no way to get home, you will be petty, vindictive and unreasonable.  Is that how you want your daughter to see you?\n\nThere have to be alternatives.  You could negotiate with the other parents to see if someone else could bring these teenagers home.  You could find out whether there is a later train that goes to somewhere not too far from where you live, and collect them from that station\u2014or every parent could collect their kid from that station.  You could arrange for a minicab hire for the three of them.  In all the communication and negotiation with the other parents, it's even possible that all the teenagers (I don't understand why you scare-quote \"friends\") will agree to leave before the final encore.\n\nHell, yes, it would absolutely be unethical and petty to plan to abandon two young people late at night with no way to get home.  You surely cannot imagine that it would be reasonable behaviour.\n\nYTA.  Are you, in actual fact, an adult?", "Info: what is the friends' solutions for getting home given they plan to miss the train? Do they have parents willing to pick them up? Have they looked into accomodation options? Do they have a relative that will let them crash the night? Have you spoken to the other parents?

I did not like a bunch of 16-year-old being that far away without a parent nearby. My choices were to either let them go with the other mom, or take them myself, or forbid my daughter from going.
