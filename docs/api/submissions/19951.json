I would make it clear to your daughter (and via her, her friends) that you\u2019re not going to be able to pick her up on that evening and they have to get the train back. On the day you should mention to your daughter to get in touch if she has any issues and to keep her location on etc so that she will call you if you have to get her, but if they know you\u2019re an option you will be the option.", "As a 17 year old girl also from the uk I would say that ywnbta to be angry at them however you would be TA if you left two young girls to fend for themselves in London in what I\u2019m assuming is late at night. If you\u2019re willing to pick your kid up you should pick the others up to. I also believe if you left them it would cause drama and perhaps a loss of friends for your kid which could lead to other problems. However OP I do agree that missing one song isn\u2019t that big of a deal and I\u2019ve had to do that a couple times.", "I guess I'd put myself in someone else's shoes for this one. As a parent, what would you want one of the other girls' parents to do? Pick up only their daughter while leaving yours and the third girl to fend for themselves? You consider the situation important enough to make a two-hour drive on your daughter's behalf should she disregard your advice and stay for the final song (she will, she's a teenager, and she's with her friends). They might be suffering from the self-centeredness that kids their age all seem to be afflicted with, but is feeling justified worth maybe learning that they were assaulted or robbed when you could have taken them back to your place and let them sort out going home in the morning?\n\nLike, I get it. Teenagers are insufferable most of the time. But they're still learning and growing. I don't think it would be out of line to charge them the cost of fuel or perhaps what the train tickets would have cost them, but I do think that if you go to pick up one, you should pick them all up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA for feeling frustrated by the situation, though.", "How are her friends getting home?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

So I can understand your frustration with teenagers planning to fail, like teenagers so often do.  \n\nBut there's at least two reasons I judge you harshly.  If you will drive to pick up your daughter, it would be a true AH move to let her 2 friends who are at the same location get stranded there.  And you are motivated to do that for your daughter's safety.  So what does it say if you don't care if other teenagers are in danger when it would take almost no effort on your part to correct that?\n\nThe other reason I say YTA is, it seems everyone missed the obvious solution.  \n\nTraveling late night will always involve some degree of risk, whether it's by rail or by highway.  Is there not a cheap hotel near the concert where the girls could crash out for a few hours and catch a train the next morning?  That would be the obvious solution.", "eh. Kinda yeah, if you do that ESH (except your kid). Look I'm all for letting kids figure shit out on their own and have consequences for their actions, but how late are we talking here, how old are they, and what do you think they are going to do?\n\nI think in general, but especially as a parent, you do actually have a moral obligation to keep minors safe, especially your child's friend (yes their her friends, the quotation marks are weirdly passive aggressive of you. If she says their her friends then they're her friends. Even if their dicks). If your driving down there to get her anyway, and yet you intentionally leave a bunch of teenagers far away from home at night I'm gonna have to call you an AH. That's just dangerous and yes would be unethical.\n\nFind out their plan. If they have another way home though, even if they have to pay for it, then you can feel justified in leaving them there.", "YWBTA. If your daughter needs a ride, just deal with her friends and drive them too. It\u2019d likely be better for your daughter that way, plus a bit safer for the other teenagers. You can stay resentful", "YTA if you drive down and don\u2019t pick up the other two.  I don\u2019t ever leave an event early unless Illness or  emergency. I paid for those tickets and should get full value. Last song sometimes ends with encores.", "I remember this move: bully and guilt the responsible friend into missing the last train and then telling them to \u201cjust call your Mom, she\u2019ll HAVE to come get us.\u201d\n\n17 was 40 years ago for me, but I had several friends who pulled that shit and then of course *I* was the one punished for not being \u201cresponsible\u201d (and leaving my friends?). \n\nJust plan to pick them all up because this is happening. Maybe make a deal with other parents to pay for your petrol.\n\nETA: YWBTA if you knowingly left those girls alone with no way home from London, even though they\u2019re the ones who caused the problem.", "NTA. The other girls presumably have parents too right? Why can't their parents come and pick them up? If their parents don't care about how they get home why should you?", "This is the answer. \n\nYou wouldn\u2019t be the asshole in this situation.

My friend and I got ourselves there and my dad just planned on picking us up. We were drunk and had clearly smoked weed and he just laughed and brought us through the McDonalds drive through, he even bought all the food for a group of metal head kids also at the concert who were trying to walk through the drive thru and were refused service.\n\nThis type of treatment was not what I normally got from my parents, they weren't the give me rides places types (or cool with drinking in general), but I was a teenager and it was a big concert experience and my dad just wanted us to have a good time and be safe. Maybe just plan on driving them as a nice thing to do? Missing the last songs of a concert is big ask for teenagers, even though as an adult it doesn't feel like a big deal. And picking them up ensures their safety after the concert.", "Jeez, don't tell them to go eff themselves. You don't need to be so nasty. It's not bad that they don't want to miss out on the whole concert. I understand not wanting to have to pick them up. But just because you're resentful don't be nasty and humiliate her daughter in front of her friends.", "Yes YWBTA. \n\nWhy not plan an evening for yourself? Let them ride the train down and meet them after the concert or drive them there, go do something yourself, then drive everyone home.", "YWBTA if you go pick up your daughter and leave her friends there. Doing so will have the friends' parent's angry with you, likely the friends angry with you, your daughter angry with you, and likely irrevocably fracturing the friendship between your daughter and her friends (although considering you put friends in quotes, you would be quite happy for your daughter to lose these friends). You may have to accept that your daughter will be traveling back on the train alone (assuming, of course, she willingly follows your instructions and leaves the concert early). Here's my suggestion, tell you daughter that if she isn't willing to miss the last song (assuming the concert does go that long) or ride the train back without her friends, she needs to plan to get a hotel for the night and come back the following morning (with or without her friends). Also, contact the parents of her friends and let them know that you have suggested this course of action since you have no desire to have to drive 2 hours round trip to collect a bunch of teens just so that they get to see EVERY song of the concert and therefore miss the train back and have no means of transportation home and possibly no safe place to stay overnight. This may get one of the other parents to be the ride or get them to force their own children to miss that last song as well.", "YTA\nThe concert hasnt happened yet? Now is the time to ask them what they will do. They are in the planning stages, how do they plan to get home? Maybe one of their other parents? A taxi? Hitchhike?", "YTA just pick them all up.   You won't have many years left with her  before she is all grown up, make the most of it now.  A car full of happy teenagers who had a good night and stayed to the end is a lovely thing.  \n\nA car with just your daughter worried about her friends, not so much.", "Nta, not your kids, not your responsibility. They have parents right? Make it CLEAR to your daughter, I\u2019m picking you up, not your friends, so they have time to plan accordingly.", "Cheap hotel in London on the night of a concert?  Unlikely to impossible, and not any safer than  going home.", "Orrr, she can tell her daughter now, \u201chey I\u2019m only picking you up, so make sure your friends have a way home that\u2019s not me\u201d and keep it moving.", "Basically whilst I can entirely see why you feel that way, your daughter will be upset if you split the group.", "Leaving a concert to the nearest train station is one of the safest times.  There are so many people from the concert doing the same thing. \n\nIf we risk assessed with accuracy, we would never let our 17 year olds cross a road or get in a car.", "Are London hotels that dangerous?  (asking, as I truly don't know)", "Have you heard of what happened in 2017 in Manchester at the end of the Ariana Grande concert? Concerr-goers including kids, made their way from Manchester Arena to the train station and ended up victims of a terror attack...", "That was at the show though right? And the stadium is in the same building as the train station iirc so the situation is not the same. A terror attack can happen anywhere, you can\u2019t really avoid it else you\u2019d never go anywhere."]}
