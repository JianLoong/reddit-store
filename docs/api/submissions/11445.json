Point in case, she was the first person I told that I was pregnant, besides my husband of course. I told her essentially a week after I got a positive pregnancy test, which was about 3 months before her wedding.\n\nI told her that I was going to tell our parents and my husband's parents around the 10 week mark, but she told me that I should hold off until her wedding in September. I'd be like 4 months along at that point, so I wouldn't be showing really, and she thought it would be so special for her to be able to make an announcement about a \"special guest\" at her wedding and it be her first niece or nephew, and my parents first grandbaby. I agreed, because it seemed like it meant a lot to her and, again, we were super close and I was happy to do that for her!\n\nTurns out, the first trimester was awful with morning sickness and exhaustion - I would have preferred to be able to talk about it with my mom, but I was willing to grin and bear it for my sister's wedding.\n\nWell, the wedding came along, and about halfway through the night, I asked her when the announcement was happening. She told me that she had changed her mind and that her wedding didn't seem like a good time or place to announce my pregnancy. I was obviously super upset since I went through a really awful first trimester with only my sister and husband to lean on. I decided I wasn't going to put the announcement on hold any longer just for her, so my husband and I pulled my parents aside and quietly told them, and told them to keep it private for the evening. They were thrilled, lots of hugs, a few tears, but a very touching and private moment. Literally no one else found out until I announced it on Facebook a week later.\n\nMy sister found out around the same time as my Facebook post when my dad mentioned how we told him about it, and she texted me and called me a bitch who made her wedding about myself, and she hasn't spoken to me since. I've messaged her and apologized probably a dozen times since then, but she refuses to talk to me, and now she refuses to come see her little nephew who is almost a month old at this point. \n\nMy parents and partner think I did nothing wrong since she went back on her word, and that I should just wait it out and she'll come around. I'm obviously unsure as clearly this has made her so upset with me, and we were so close before. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I've seen a lot of comments saying that I was trying to be petty, mean, vindictive, spiteful, hurt my sister, etc. and I just wanted to address that really quickly. If I had been any of those things, I would have made sure she found out that I had done it, you know? She just happened to find out a week later because my dad let it slip. I just desperately wanted to tell my mom, and after waiting over two months for my sister, it really felt like I couldn't wait another moment at the whims of someone who wasn't even involved in the pregnancy. I understand now though that I definitely should not have waited to tell my mom about the pregnancy.

Absolutely nothing wrong with pulling your parents aside after this has been the day in your mind that they would find out for a long time. I don't want this to be over the top, but it almost seems to me like she didn't want people to know beforehand because people would be congratulating you so her announcing it at the wedding was a way to make sure nobody else knew beforehand and then telling you that she actually decided differently was a way to make sure nobody found out at the wedding either.", "NTA I personally think your sister deliberately done that so that you wouldn't take any limelight away from her during and leading upto the wedding", "ESH you should have never agreed to something like this when you needed support from at a minimum your mom.

She didn't want you to delay the announcement to have a special moment at her wedding. I don't think the announcement was ever in her plan.

Are you that self absorbed?  Why lasso the limelight at her wedding? You had so many options. Delaying it 1 hour after the event was too much for you to consider?

No one else is supposed to have a big life event happen because it distracts from their wedding. It\u2019s the bride\u2019s day has morphed to it\u2019s the bride\u2019s season or year.

Maybe that was the sister\u2019s plan all along since she never bothered to tell OP she changed her mind - this way she\u2019d keep OP from getting ANY extra attention before her special day.

She is for not telling you she\u2019d changed her mind. She brought this on herself.", "NTA. She lied from the start, she told you to announce it at the wedding and then back tracked because she didn\u2019t want ANY attention that wasn\u2019t 100% about her at any point leading up to her wedding.", "You didn't make an announcement you quietly told your parents which is fair because she backed out.

There was room for letting your parents know about the pregnancy before the wedding, but she **manipulated** you into staying quiet with her song and dance about \"announcing it at the wedding.\" She's jealous, and she wants you to grovel forever for not letting her take all the oxygen all the time.

Now you both have *this* as a memory, but at least baby can be spared.", "NTA I think your sister tricked you into hiding your pregnancy because she didn't want it to overshadow her wedding.

OP's sister took extra support from her for 3 plus months in order to be able to have that moment at the wedding and then switched up at the very last minute. OP told her parents in a kind and quiet way.\n\nHonestly, I feel the sister played OP because what she really wanted to do was make sure that no one was focused on anything but her until her wedding was over so I truly believe that she lied to OP and was never going to announce at the wedding. \n\nPeople don't need to take the feelings of others into account after they have already been treated badly. \n\nNTA, OP, and please stop apologizing.

Your sister on the other hand is HUGE AH!  Stop apologizing to her, when is she going to apologize to you for stealing the joy of announcing your first pregnancy.

The wedding was about her.\n\nYour sister sounds self-centered and self-absorbed. She did not want ANY attention taken from her leading up to the wedding. She knew you'd comply when she told you to wait and announce it at her wedding when she had no intention of letting you announce it then either.

If you and your sister were really as close as you think you were, then I suspect your sister is hiding something from you. Her reaction to your pregnancy is baffling.

I hope you and your sister can mend your relationship. I am sending you the best for your new little bundle of joy! My personal advice is to move past it and focus on your immediate family.

Then after you quietly told your parents, which she didn\u2019t even KNOW about until after the wedding, so it obviously didn\u2019t ruin her special day or steal the spotlight, she considers that a great enough offense to cut you off completely.

You were also under no obligation to comply with her new demands when she didn't honor your agreement.  Despite this, you didn't make the announcement publicly and didn't take any attention away from the bride and groom.

She could have at least let you tell y'all's parents and you could have just made the announcement to everyone else after the wedding. Just ignore her for now like your parents said and she will come around. If she doesn't then she's just big brat. I can't believe she refuses to see her own nephew.

Four months is really far along in a pregnancy to get your support system in place, and her sister should have thought more about that the days before the wedding rather than make such a big decision day-of.\n\n Now, sister is still forgivable at that point, weddings are stressful, and people change their minds. But to go so far as to not talk to your sister though the rest of the pregnancy and birth and the most vulnerable time in the innocent infant nephews life is at a whole other level of AH. letting her choice to change her mind turn into such a large family drama is extremely self-centered and pretty awful, especially if they were so close.

But just think of how magical it will be for her to have both her daughters having milestone moments on the same day!\" So I was pretty sure it was still happening, but you're right, I should have kept checking in as we got closer. 3 weeks is a lot of time for things to change during event planning.", "Ops sister physically and mentally tortured op to have her special day.\n\nWith the promise it would be worth it with an announcement at the wedding. \n\nWith absolutely no conversation she backtracked despite knowing about the physical and mental torture op had gone through for her. \n\nOp you're NTA but you're sister is massively narcissistic", "The sister was never going to announce it.

The sister clearly never had any intention of announcing the pregnancy. She just didn\u2019t want OP to announce and then have any attention taken away from her upcoming wedding.

So no harm, no foul\n\nHaving your sister dictate when you can announce your pregnancy is pretty messed up. The sister is an asshole for not letting OP announce it on her own time.

Either way, the sister sounds incredibly selfish. \n\nOP, you are NTA. But you were easily manipulated by your sister. Does this happen a lot? Is she historically self involved/an attention hog?", "This would be the case if the sister hadn\u2019t explicitly asked her to keep it under wraps before the wedding keeping her from the support system she needed but went without for her.

HER day doesn\u2019t give her a free pass to believe everything should revolve and her, and your belief that OP is \u201crevenge spilling\u201d for wanting her parents to know and announcing months after she wanted to is pretty wild.", "Found the sisters account", "It\u2019s not HER day, it\u2019s a day.

There were no exaggerated screams of delight when she discreetly told her parents. Nothing was taken away from the sister or her wedding.", "She was discreet to be considerate to the sister when the sister had zero consideration for her.

OP is NTA, the sister is for deniing OP assistance from family on the first trimester of the pregnancy.", "She told her parents, very discreetly at that. If she had made a full blown announcement I would totally say she's the AH. But she handled it quietly and is NTA. Presumably her parents have the capability to be happy for their 2 daughters at the same time.", "No. Her sister set her up on purpose because she didn't just want to be the center of attention at her wedding, but for the entire four months leading up to it, too.

Otherwise her reaction when she found out a week later that the OP had told her parents would be coming from way out of left field.

It\u2019s possible. But I feel like it\u2019s combination the FB announcement a week after the wedding and finding out the parents were told prior to that. If no one but the parents knew about the pregnancy then how was the whole wedding about OP? Almost no one knew. Guests weren\u2019t talking about it at the wedding. They weren\u2019t coming up to OP to congratulate her. They weren\u2019t making comments to the bride about how exciting it is to be having a new member of the family on the way.

I don't know about all of you, but I love my friends and family enough that if they wanted to make a big announcement of a baby or engagement at my reception, I'd probably give them my blessing. You know, as long as they didn't try to disrupt the first dance or other special moments. But when everyone is just hanging out, eating, and dancing? Announce away.", "NTA. You quietly told them. If she didn't even notice then I'm sure the wedding was successful and all eyes on her. You suffered alone enough and at least it wasn't a public announcement with all eyes on you.", "NTA. Stop apologizing, she should be apologizing to you. It had NO effect on her wedding, especially given she didn\u2019t know you told your parents until a week later. I don\u2019t know how close you really are, but what she did was hurtful and spiteful. I\u2019m really sorry she did this to you.", "NTA. Your sister didn't even know until OP's dad posted about it so clearly it didn't interfere with the wedding", "You didn\u2019t announce it. You secretly told your parents. \n\nYour sister has very high expectations for her wedding and most likely didn\u2019t achieve it so she\u2019s placing the blame on you. It\u2019s done.

Well, after two postponements each, they both had a \"minimony\" and moved the big weddings to 2021. The younger had her \"real\" wedding first, in June, and because they had put things off a year, they started trying for a baby in July. My son in law, ol' sure shot, hit the mark the FIRST MONTH. I knew, but wasn't saying anything because older sister was getting married in October. September was the bridal shower, and my niece outed the pregnant daughter - not that she knew, she noticed she wasn't drinking. \n\nOops. But sister wasn't mad, it's become one of those stories, and thank goodness the wedding went off before younger sis couldn't fit the MOH dress. \n\nNo, OP, you are NTA.

OP replied and explained that she told only her parents in private, and did not announce it at the wedding in public. And her sister used to be a \"mean girl\" in the past, but thought she had grown out of her bad behaviors in recent years. \n\nINFO: OP, does your sister do manipulative things like this regularly? Or is this one time the anomaly? It's confusing because you say you're really close, but it's obvious that your sister couldn't be honest with you about her thoughts and intentions regarding your pregnancy announcement and her wanting the wedding spotlight.\n\nYour sis, is absolutely wrong for not communicating honestly with you. And bc she ended up misleading you at best or manipulating you at worst. And you missed out on support you could have been getting from your tribe.", "Well, your sister was TA for asking you to wait until the 4th month, then changing her mind the day of (she probably didn't want anything distracting from HER wedding plans).

Hopefully she came to her senses and you have mended the relationship.", "Omg and you suffered through your first trimester just so she could supposedly announce it at her wedding! I think your sister is a lot more devious/self-centered than you realized.

It\u2019s actually cruel .. You couldn\u2019t tell your family FOR MONTHS. Something anyone would do because we want to talk about our struggles we\u2019re going through with your family .. She did that so that NO ONE would talk about your pregnancy and your parents could focus on your sister instead of talking about the baby, or your baby bump or going around like how grandparents do already buying them baby gifts before the birth\u2026 she took those beautiful moments away from you.. I could not imagine doing something like that to my sister. I wouldn\u2019t mind that just cause I\u2019m getting married, my parents still might want to talk about my sisters baby in the way, or tell me that they\u2019re going to help her out go shop with her because she\u2019s tired. I mean, it\u2019s just absuuuurd and cruel. Those few moments of pregnancy can be so magical .

Pfft.", "Oh, maybe it wasn't clear, she only told me that she had changed her mind about halfway through the wedding itself. That's when I felt like I couldn't wait any longer and pulled my parents aside.", "I mean, she was definitely a bit of a \"mean girl\" back in high school, but she seriously seemed to have grown out of it since then, and it was so long ago. She's more of a perfectionist than manipulative in my experience, though - she'll get upset if things don't go exactly as she planned them to, even if they technically turn out okay in the end, which is why I assume this upset her so much.", "Yah, sorry but discreetly telling her parents, after her sister had already broken her promise is anything but an AH move.", "Her parents can skip out on supporting her sister on what I'm sure will be the lead up to her next wedding as she doesn't sound like the most pleasant person to be married to.", "Yes. Doing that, even to enable the \u201cspecial announcement\u201d as OP\u2019s sister claimed she planned to do, was wrong of the sister to push for. Sister made OP\u2019s pregnancy about herself.

Sister wanted to enjoy mom and dad attention the months leading up to her wedding.", "Totally agree with this. Especially because the sister\u2019s idea essentially WAS her announcing her sister\u2019s pregnancy, which would have kept the attention on her. I didn\u2019t think about that at first, but it\u2019s definitely weird.", "I can\u2019t understand what\u2019s changed either I think we just have a lot more self absorbed people in the world. Weddings are about the vows the couple is making and the reception meant to celebrate the journey the couple are embarking on of building a life together. Not about the bride being center of attention for day month year it\u2019s no wonder so many marriages end in divorce. So many brides only seem interested in the event of marriage and attention rather then the new life they are beginning with their spouse.

I think she went ballistic afterwards because she still wanted it to be all about her", "You are definitely NTA, but your sister is a piece of work. I highly doubt she EVER intended to make the announcement and just led you on for months so all of the attention would be on her leading up to the wedding.", "Ahhh gotcha. Yeah, then it wasn't even petty. You needed love and support and shouldn't have had to wait so long to begin with. I'm glad you had that happy private moment with them. You didn't do anything wrong.", "> more of a perfectionist than manipulative in my experience\n\nShe clearly manipulated you here.

Maybe considered any other judgment (like this one) to attempt to see from your sister\u2019s (AH) perspective, but the reality remains that you sister is the AH and even close family members (like your sister) can be completely unhinged and do incredibly stupid shit.", "u/weddingdrama2022 \\- it's not perfectionism. It's manipulation disguised as perfectionism. \n\nIf it's just a perfectionist thing where she has to have everything go exactly according to plan, then she would have let you know in advance that she had changed her mind about making the announcement during the wedding. Dropping a bomb like that in the middle of the wedding made things \\*more\\* unpredictable, not less.\n\nAre you generally a pretty agreeable sort of person? It's just, after reading through all your comments it seems to me that she was banking on being able to renege on the plan mid wedding because she knew you would just \"go along to get along.\" That's not being a perfectionist. That's being manipulative and unkind, especially when she knew all along what a difficult time you were having.", "Has she ever given you the silent treatment before? Or done so with anyone else for so long a time? Because this extending to her not meeting her nephew seems wildly out of proportion with what happened. It's not normal behavior, so I'm curious if it's normal for her.\n\nI know you said you were close, so maybe this is not relevant, but I'm wondering if this is a mask for something else that's been simmering for awhile with her. Has she ever expressed jealousy of you before? Does she also have a good relationship with your parents?  I don't mean to try to make it seem like she or you or your parents are in the wrong, or even that there is one true reason (there may not be) but it's just truly bizarre and irrational to cut you off over this. \n\nNTA, btw. I'm sorry you're going through this.", "Her version of perfection is a disturbing one. If perfect to her means you have to have a difficult pregnancy without support and her shaming you for any step out of line, she's not actually a nice person. She's just gotten better at covering it up.", "OP: I'm so sorry she did this to you. This was so selfish of her and you deserved so much better from your own sister. You're NTA for telling anybody you want to whenever you want to. And you didn't make a public announcement at her wedding. Your sister is the totally selfish one in this situation. I hope she can come to her senses, but if not, reddit can tell her off too.", "I actually feel incredibly bad for OP", "Sounds like little sister is jealous of OP and needs to work on her issues.

She loves ignoring OP\u2019s phone calls.", "I agree. Talk to your mum about those missing months. And to your MIL (please don\u2019t forget her in all of this!!). Unlike the imaginary wedding year, your pregnancy journey was a physical event that took place, they may feel you left them out intentionally. They and you missed so much family bonding over this and your sister is still ruining your enjoyment. I\u2019m sorry this is happening. Please focus on your beautiful baby, your new family dynamic and build a strong bond with your mums.", "Especially since it was OPs first and she was so ill, must have scared to death not having anyone that had experience to go through that with. I'm sorry OP.", "I would have caved and told my mom earlier. Every expecting mama deserves to have their mom or someone similar to get them through it. Pregnancy can be so isolating for women even when they have all the support in the world. OP\u2019s sister is truly selfish for taking that away from her sister and her mom.", "That\u2019s so weird to me. Three of my cousins got married within six weeks of my wedding, either side. I did not care. We went to their weddings and celebrated with them and they with us.", "I completely agree that sis should be the one apologizing. I hope OP stops apologizing to her. She\u2019s accepting blame that should not be on her, making her sister think she has all the more right to be mad. She may be so entitled that she wouldn\u2019t grasp the reality of how wrong she is if properly called out, but that should have started a long time ago with OP standing her ground and the parents calling out her sister. \n\nAnd to be honest, I\u2019m all for forgiveness and repairing relationships, and sometimes (definitely not always, but sometimes) even apologizing when you aren\u2019t wrong if the relationship is important. If sis had accepted her apology and moved on, fine I guess because this could be long in the past with OP knowing not to trust her sister but otherwise having a decent relationship. But being so damn petty about something that didn\u2019t even impact her is taking it 1000x too far. At this point it\u2019s on sis to fix it and should involve some major apology action.", "OP said all she had was hubby and her sister for support, but I am betting she only had hubby cause we all know the sister wouldn't have helped cause she had her special day to plan and those four months were all about her.\n\nETA, NTA, and OP never let your sister dictate YOUR special announcements ever again.\n\nETA what if OP had heaven forbid had a miscarriage in those four months. Did the sister expect OP to just grieve quietly all alone without her mum and then attend and put on a happy face for the sisters wedding.", "Probably because they read the title and not the post", "People calling her the A H probably only read the title. NTA.", "This guy narcissists.", "OMG \ud83d\ude31 I think that is seriously the saddest and most despicable thing I have ever heard. I hope that woman doesn't procreate, to teach another generation to be that self centered would be a crime", "oh man. very sorry to hear this and the comments below. there might be ways to find it on unreddit or whatever. anyone know of ways around this?", "That's because you're a normal person.\r  \n\r  \nThere are a lot of sick, self-centered people who think me, me, me", "His entire family made his impending death about them, so chances probably aren't good there", "That is so, so sad. Poor guy. \ud83d\ude22", "This right here!  OP and sister  aren\u2019t as close as OP thinks they are, and OP\u2019s sister was using that against OP.", "Ooh, that first sentence. Yeah, even if she had followed through with the announcement, it wasn't her announcement to make, her joy to share. OP absolutely deserved to be the one to share that with their parents.", "I'm sort of sad that Grandma at least didn't figure out what was going on when OP was so sick during the first trimester. Not one: \"You've lost weight, are you okay?\" or similar comment in 4 months???", "My wedding was so little planned and so lax that had all 10 of my guests announced on the day that they were pregnant I would've hugged them all. Our day was a day of happiness and celebrating. Happy news of ours + happy news of others would make for even more cause and excitement over it all \ud83d\udc9a more special to have my friends have something incredible coming their way and getting to celebrate both on our day would have been fine :)\n\nOur day was so simply planned out that had literally anything happened (short of the celebrant passing as he is a cherished friend of ours as well and would have devastated us) nothing could have dampened the day. Rain, hail, nothing. We had bushfires that were around our area that caused roads to be closed down for a week and the best man from the area over couldn't make it in. We found a way for him because he was stressing and heartbroken but like? None of it would have stopped us being together.\n\nI don't get these bridezillas, nor really anyone that cares so much about a party with mates and family to say \"hey, we're staying together permanently and love eachother stupid amounts\". Could have done it alone together even.", "Yes Yes..sister is a classic narcissist and OP you need to be aware and know that she is and stop letting her manipulate you forever after!!", "It sounds weird for her to announce your pregnancy as a special guest. It is not her right to announce your pregnancy. She is all about herself. Just as well she is not talking to you. You don 't need the stress.", "**NTA** but if I were you\n\n **I WOULD BE CHOOSING NOT TO TALK TO HER**\n\nI know it\u2019s been said but it\u2019s true op. \n\n**YOUR SISTER NEVER INTENDED TO ANNOUNCE YOUR PREGNACY AT HER WEDDING SHE JUST DIDNT WANT YOUR NEWS TO ECLIPSE HER** \n\nYour sisters a snake. Not only would I be going low to no contact if I were you, I would not allow her around you or your family even after she comes around. \n\n**YOU ARE THE ONE THAT DESERVES TO BE MAD SHE STOLE MONTHS OF DESPERATELY NEEDED SUPPORT** during the most difficult parts of your pregnancy over her petty BS\n\n**ALSO** you never stole her moment she didn\u2019t even know it happened. She\u2019s only mad because her plan didn\u2019t go ~perfectly~ according to plan. she thought she could force you into submission and banked on it. **she\u2019s not mad you stole her moment she\u2019s mad you had the balls to draw a line in the sand and refused to cower and be bullied silent any longer** Even so you were graceful enough not to make it public. She should be damn grateful she\u2019s not my sister or I\u2019d be posting everything you put here on blast including her robbing you of support so everyone knows the real trash human she is. \n\n**I also don\u2019t think you were as close as you thought you were** and even if you were:\n\n**THE MOMENT SHE REALIZED YOU WERE PREGNANT SHE SAW THE FUTURE FIRST GRANDCHILD AS A THREAT AND NOT THE BLESSING THAT THEY ARE THAT IS WHAT MAKES HER CRUEL AND DOWNRIGHT DESPICABLE**", "Came here for this. Reddit did not disappoint. Have an upvote.", "Do your parents know the full story of why you waited so long to tell them? I hope so", "Yeah here\u2019s the thing if you say something to someone at a wedding and no one else knows about it, you didn\u2019t announce it. You just told someone.", "Totally! My SO has been incredible and supportive. But sometimes you just need your mom.", "Isn't it incredible how the sister concocted this entire plan in an instant when OP told her the news? These people are so far from anything I would describe as normal, I'm glad I don't have one in my family.", "NTA!  Me too! I think I'd actually cry it'd knife me so badly if my daughter didn't tell me she was pregnant until month 4. I'd feel like I missed a precious moment that could never repeat, not for any genuine reason but for the manipulation and selfishness by. .. by my other daughter?!\n\nYes, I'd also have a few choice words for my other daughter that'd definitely ruin her precious \"wedding year.\" \n\n I'd feel like I failed as a parent if my adult daughter was so selfish and entitled and downright cruel and manipulative to her pregnant sister. How dare she treat her own family that way. I would want to understand what was running through the bride's head that she thought it was okay to do this to her sister.\n\nI would be devastated for both of their behavior, but in very different ways.", "NTA, please try not to call her anymore. Its her loss, what kind of auntie is she going to be when she doesn\u2019t even want to know her nephew that she has been known about\u2026 over a moment that had nothing to do with her and she just found out about? But thats the problem, it didn\u2019t have anything to do with her. You have every right to share your beautiful journey with your parents, the same way she was forcing the family to do for her. Plus she could break up with her husband or have ended the wedding, your child is the next generation in the family lineage. Whats wrong with this girl!", "These grandparents have a genuinely SICK household culture. They don't seem to care that a daughter of the house went through months of her first pregnancy without her mom. And young mom owes her sister exactly nothing---not an apology, not the time of if day.", "I have them. It\u2019s awful. The only way I\u2019ve ever been successful at handling it is to gray rock myself out of their lives. I\u2019ve tried really hard to get them to see, or to talk to them, but nothing. Becoming so boring that they can\u2019t take anything from me anymore has been the only thing that\u2019s ever worked. \n\nI think what\u2019s triggering to me about this post is that fake benevolence. The way sister spun it as this positive thing and how awesome it will be! And then that off handed thing about changing her mind, but only after OP brought it up. Like there\u2019s no overt malice or anything aggressively nasty, it\u2019s all so covert and underhanded. So it makes it difficult to see the malice underneath. The way it\u2019s presented as something good so that you\u2019re the bad one for ruining it just fucks with reality.", "I want to hug him so much for going through that trauma.", "And OPs sister is a manipulative narcissist that wants to control OP. No more OP. Don't listen to her anymore. Do what makes sense to you. \n\nNTA", "I agree so hard on this point. I didn't tell my family I was pregnant during my first trimester because I had a couple of scares and I wanted to make sure all was well before announcing. Going through it without the support of my Mom was the hardest aspect. We are still grieving the loss of my Dad so I couldn't bring myself to tell my mom and sister that I'm pregnant and then have something devastating happen.", "\"Ok sure. I'll just tell Death that it's an inconvenient time because my sister got married last month....  \n\n\"Oh, I need to die anyway? Well then I guess I'll die scared and alone because I can't tell anyone in my family or my sister will tell everyone I'm trying to ruin her wedding year by dying.\"", "It was an absolutely HEARTBREAKING post. Just thinking about the fact that he was so abused by his family (and if your family can have you questioning if you're an asshole for *dying*, you were abused). Fortunately, his husband was there to support him (they got married when he was told he was terminal so his family couldn't cut his partner out of his life if/when he was incapacitated) and everyone in the comments was able to convince him to stop wasting any of his limited time on his abusive family of origin and spend every second he had left with his chosen family."]}
