Point in case, she was the first person I told that I was pregnant, besides my husband of course. I told her essentially a week after I got a positive pregnancy test, which was about 3 months before her wedding.\n\nI told her that I was going to tell our parents and my husband's parents around the 10 week mark, but she told me that I should hold off until her wedding in September. I'd be like 4 months along at that point, so I wouldn't be showing really, and she thought it would be so special for her to be able to make an announcement about a \"special guest\" at her wedding and it be her first niece or nephew, and my parents first grandbaby. I agreed, because it seemed like it meant a lot to her and, again, we were super close and I was happy to do that for her!\n\nTurns out, the first trimester was awful with morning sickness and exhaustion - I would have preferred to be able to talk about it with my mom, but I was willing to grin and bear it for my sister's wedding.\n\nWell, the wedding came along, and about halfway through the night, I asked her when the announcement was happening. She told me that she had changed her mind and that her wedding didn't seem like a good time or place to announce my pregnancy. I was obviously super upset since I went through a really awful first trimester with only my sister and husband to lean on. I decided I wasn't going to put the announcement on hold any longer just for her, so my husband and I pulled my parents aside and quietly told them, and told them to keep it private for the evening. They were thrilled, lots of hugs, a few tears, but a very touching and private moment. Literally no one else found out until I announced it on Facebook a week later.\n\nMy sister found out around the same time as my Facebook post when my dad mentioned how we told him about it, and she texted me and called me a bitch who made her wedding about myself, and she hasn't spoken to me since. I've messaged her and apologized probably a dozen times since then, but she refuses to talk to me, and now she refuses to come see her little nephew who is almost a month old at this point. \n\nMy parents and partner think I did nothing wrong since she went back on her word, and that I should just wait it out and she'll come around. I'm obviously unsure as clearly this has made her so upset with me, and we were so close before.

Your sister didn\u2019t want you to steal any of her wedding thunder leading up to the wedding. She saw this as her time and the focus was supposed to be on her upcoming life event, not yours. That\u2019s why she told you not to tell anyone at all and then she\u2019d announce it at the wedding. I don\u2019t think she ever planned to announce. It was just a way to keep you from telling anyone so she could be the center of attention for months.", "Preganacy \n\nIsn't this a meme", "That\u2019s a Meghan Markle move.

You had to ask when it was going to happen halfway through the reception and then she just tells you oh I changed my mind. Extremely selfish to not tell you that before. You literally waited a month and a half to two months so she could make the announcement at her wedding. Absolutely nothing wrong with pulling your parents aside after this has been the day in your mind that they would find out for a long time. I don't want this to be over the top, but it almost seems to me like she didn't want people to know beforehand because people would be congratulating you so her announcing it at the wedding was a way to make sure nobody else knew beforehand and then telling you that she actually decided differently was a way to make sure nobody found out at the wedding either.", "NTA I personally think your sister deliberately done that so that you wouldn't take any limelight away from her during and leading upto the wedding", "ESH you should have never agreed to something like this when you needed support from at a minimum your mom. I would have personally put my foot down on that earlier, you should have been able to tell even just your parents. \n\nYour sister is selfish and unreasonable asking you for that. \n\nYou getting upset and telling them at the wedding is petty, you could have waited 24 more hours.", "Yta, you couldnt wait 1 day without making the wrdding about yourself huh?\n\nHope she opened her eyes and wont talk to you for a while", "ESH I had really bad morning sickness, so I know what you went through.

You could have waited 1 more day.", "ESH, your sister shouldn't have went back on her idea, especially if this was something she was helping you to plan for, but also you could've waited until after the wedding / honeymoon before saying anything to other people. \n\nI think the main issue here was you going ahead and telling your parents about the pregnancy, even though they kept it to themselves, your sister might've seen that as you being petty, i.e. she thinks you were trying to take your parents attention away from her on her wedding day.", "YTA - you literally could have waited 24-48 hours to drop the big news.", "NTA, and I don\u2019t understand all the Y T A judgements here. Your sister is the big AH here and is overreacting big time, she didn\u2019t even realize it at the time, so it didn\u2019t take anything from her big day. She seems very spoiled and main character syndrome all over. \n\nIf I were you I would not let her meet your baby at all (she doesn\u2019t seem to care about it) because of all her jealousy.", "Softest YTA possible, and only because you did tell your parents at your sister's wedding partially as an FU to your sister. You could have waited until the next morning. Those 12 hours were not that important. \n\nBut your sister is a much bigger A-hole. She didn't want you to delay the announcement to have a special moment at her wedding. I don't think the announcement was ever in her plan. She wanted the delay so that the weeks before the wedding were not spoiled for her by everyone focusing on your pregnancy. She underestimated you and thought that you would stay quiet at the wedding.", "NTA. She never had the intention of making an announcement she just didn\u2019t want your pregnancy taking her spotlight before the wedding.", "NTA because you told them discreetly after your sister played an obvious trick on you. Clearly, it didn\u2019t even make an impact on the wedding because it took her being told it happened to even be aware of it. \n\nI don\u2019t think she ever intended to make that announcement. She just didn\u2019t want attention taken away from her while she planned her wedding where she did a really nasty rug pull. She essentially denied you of much needed support during a very touchy time so her special day remained front and center.", "ESH\n\nYou could\u2019ve waited 24 hours. That information was truly not helpful nor necessary for anyone to know at the wedding. You decided to do it then to prove a point & to hurt your sister. \n\nYour sister should own the fact that she reneged on your agreement. She has just as much ownership of causing this problem as you do.\n\neta \u2014 this isn\u2019t a \u201cbride\u201d moment. It\u2019s about changing the memory of this milestone day. Now sister will remember how OP couldn\u2019t just wait until the day was over to announce her pregnancy to their parents. It changed the memory from sister\u2019s wedding day to her Mom & Dad remembering the day as how excited they were to hear about their soon-to-be grandchild.", "I came into this ready to tear you a new one, but you surprised me! NTA, given that your mother could have been there to support you if not for your sister's disingenuous offer.\n\nYou didn't 'announce' your pregnancy, you told two people that you are close to, after the main festivities were over.", "I don\u2019t usually do an ESH. Feel this is the case. Your sister shouldn\u2019t have backtracked. I think she should have told you from the door, as soon as I step away from the wedding reception, have at it, if you like. You could have easily waited a few more hours to say something, until she was off on the honeymoon.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What makes her an even bigger AH is holding the grudge for so long and not seeing her nephew. \n\nGrow up. Both of you.", "I think the bride is in the deep hole here.  She should not have made you wait to tell anyone about the arrival coming to the family.  You apparently had a rough first trimester and could have used all the help you could get as well as support and she took that from you.  I am not wishing this on anyone but a situation could have arisen that was very highly urgent or an emergency and it would have been a complete shock to your parents, husband's parents and so forth and may have caused a bigger issue than just speaking out about the upcoming bundle of joy.  I would not have waited to share my news.  Besides, the time frame up to the wedding does not belong to the bride, just one day is hers.  People have lives and so forth going on and can not drop or plan around her wedding events to live life.", "ESH\n\nShe shouldn't have gone back on the plan last minute.

If I had been In your shoes I would have been pissed at my sister, but waited until the next day or  a few days later to get my parents and in laws together to tell them. Why you agreed making an announcement at your sisters wedding was appropriate in the first place is beyond me despite it being her suggestion. You can\u2019t blame her for deciding she\u2019d rather not do it then.", "ESH\n\nBut you way more. It wasn't a great thing for her to change her mind, but regardless it's her wedding and you made it about yourself. Pretty gross behavior", "NTA - Frankly I would have told her I am not waiting to share my news just for her to have the moment.  You didn't scream out to everyone that you were pregnant, you had a private conversation with your parents and no one else found out that day and the only reason she found out you had done it at the wedding was your dad mentioning it after the fact.  I am sure your parents attention was only pulled from her for what 5-10 minutes of an all day affair. \n\nThis is like those posts were a couple had a private moment to themselves away from the wedding and got engaged and then somehow the bride is still mad even though it was not at the reception and it was not announced the same day.", "YTA - You're unsure why she is so upset? Are you that self absorbed?  Why lasso the limelight at her wedding? You had so many options. Delaying it 1 hour after the event was too much for you to consider?  You created the reason why your sister will not engage with you or your son.", "NTA - when I saw the tittle I thought you meant like to everyone. But you just told your parents. That\u2019s it. It was quiet, out of the way. No one else knew. And I\u2019m sure you guys went back to putting all the attention on your sister. Your sister is the AH.", "ESH, her for making you wait and then backtracking, you - for not waiting like 1 other day, to play petty.", "YTA. You really couldn\u2019t have waited one more day until she\u2019s gone for her honeymoon?", "Nta", "NTA- she made you wait till you were over 12 weeks, and not tell your mum, which it seemed you coukd have used the support. Then she took it back , and didn\u2019t tell you till you asked at the wedding. That was a HUGE asshole move.  Congrats on the pregnancy !!", "Man people really take the whole \"wedding day is only about the bride\" thing to a whole new level.\n\nOnly the grandparents found out about the pregnancy, it didn't eclipse the wedding day all. \n\nNTA.", "I was all set to say Y T A. \nBut NTA\nYou wanted to tell your parents. Your sister insisted on you waiting to make it a moment at her wedding.\nThen, last minute she changes her mind. So you tell your parents privately; you didn\u2019t make a big announcement. \nNow she\u2019s mad and won\u2019t talk to you? Stop apologizing; you did nothing wrong.", "So she waits maybe a month and a half and keeps it from her parents at her sister's request and then decides to honor her sister's day of change of not making an announcement to everybody, but privately pulls aside her parents and tells them? That's what makes her TA? You can hardly say she's in the wrong when her sister wanted to make an announcement in front of everybody and then didn't even tell her that she had changed the plan until she asked when the announcement would happen.", "Oh you deluded idiot! What a way to bring someone who has nothing to do with this into it! Bet your a mumbles mcbuttons fan!", "She told her literal parents in private. Her sister took away the ability to make the announcement. An announcement isn't a private conversation between a daughter and her parents. OP had been wanting to tell them for weeks and held off because of what her sister wanted. She's right there at the wedding with her parents and can obviously be forgiven for not wanting to keep that any longer since she had already wrapped her head around this being the day that she could finally tell them.", "OMG. you are so right about the sister. \nSo sorry for your rough time.   When you think you are wrong remember how she elf t give a rats ass about your misery.", "No shit it\u2019s her wedding YTA", "If it had been OP's idea to announce at the wedding I'd totally agree, but she waited because her sister encouraged her to, then her sister backed out last minute. Even then, OP quietly pulled her parents aside and didn't make a big deal out of it. That's not stealing the limelight at all. NTA.", "How self absorbed is someone to have their sister not tell their parents about the pregnancy for months just so it doesn\u2019t pull any attention from their upcoming wedding?!? Because I strongly suspect that\u2019s what really happened. The sister didn\u2019t intend to announce at the wedding. She just didn\u2019t want her parents being distracted by excitement for their expectant grandchild when they\u2019re supposed to be 100% focused on her upcoming wedding. Seems like brides these days don\u2019t want just \u201ctheir day\u201d. No, now it\u2019s their day plus month leading up to their day.", "I just want to say, since a couple people have mentioned it, I wasn't trying to be petty, mean, or hurt my sister. If I had been, I would have made sure she found out about it, you know? She just happened to find out a week later because my dad let it slip. I just desperately wanted to tell my mom, and after waiting over two months for my sister, it really felt like I couldn't wait another moment at the whims of someone who wasn't even involved in the pregnancy. I may very well still be the asshole, but I just wanted to clear that up.", "I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s brides have always been this self absorbed and because of social media it\u2019s just more obvious or if this is just a more recent trend. I do know that I see a lot more about brides taking the attitude that the months leading up to the wedding are supposed to be all about them. No one else is supposed to have a big life event happen because it distracts from their wedding. It\u2019s the bride\u2019s day has morphed to it\u2019s the bride\u2019s season or year. Getting married is exciting, but no one cares about the wedding as much as the bride.", "Weddings are not just about the bride. It\u2019s about a day that is meant to be a celebration of 2 people & their families. It\u2019s challenging to eclipse a wedding, however you can easily affect & potentially ruin the memory of that milestone day.\n\nIt\u2019s a milestone in people\u2019s lives. They like to remember it as a perfect day.", "Totally agree. I don\u2019t see why people are calling OP the AH here. Entitled sister asked OP to hold off telling anyone about the pregnancy so that she could make OP\u2019s pregnancy all about her at her wedding\u2026 then changed her mind at the wedding. OP quietly told her parents about the pregnancy - did not make a public announcement or did anything to steal the limelight away from sister/bridezilla\u2026 and only a week later, sister/bridezilla finds out about a private conversation between OP and parents, and blows a gasket.\n\nOP is not the AH here, but sister/bridezilla sure is.", "I\u2019m sorry but you could\u2019ve told them the next morning. That was an option."]}
