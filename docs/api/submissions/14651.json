They are also obedient and they're very future-oriented, they know what they wanted to do, and are taking the necessary steps to achieve said goals(Isa wants to go in medicine, so she's volunteering at a hospital and doing chemistry-related extracurriculars, while Ruth wants to go to Art school so she is going to classes and producing works to add to her portfolio for college).\n\nI have been dating Maddie(30F) for 6 months now, and she's great. She's really thoughtful and the kids love her. The only problem is that Maddie tends to be a bit of an activist. I was able to tolerate it since it didn't affect me much, and I thought it was kind of nice that she has a hobby and she likes making those cute sings and going to the rallies and protests. Personally, I don't think I could get into that sort of thing, but I mean, to each their own.\n\nThe only problem is that lately, Maddie's began rubbing off on the kids. Isa and Ruth are displaying an unhealty interest in politics and world affairs, which they don't really need because they're still kids, and they're primary objective should be studying, getting the best grades, and perfecting their skills so that they can enter adult life fully prepared. Maddie's been talking to them about issues facing our country, and she's speaking to them in a way that I'm not really comfortable with, and her stances on many issues oppose mine ideologically, and I just don't feel that it's right. Maddie even took the kids to rallies without telling me, which is really dangerous, because there are all kinds of people at the rallies. I told her that she should ask me before doing something like that, and she said ok, but last Saturday, she crossed my boundaries again, and she showed my kids an incendiary movie. This movie is known for being anti-government, and encouraging all kinds of revolutionary symptoms. In particular, I deeply disagreed with the movie's overall premise of using force and anger to bring about change so I got really annoyed and yelled at Maddie, saying that she's crossing her boundaries and that as their parent it's my responsibility to regulate the kind of content the kids get to watch, and I told her that she can't see my kids anymore. In response, she said I was an idiot, and it's the 21st century so they'll find content and make up their own mind, so now we're not speaking to each other until she apologizes to me and agrees to set boundaries with my kids.

Politics are a wonderful thing for children to become interested in!  Just like art and medicine are wonderful interests.

They're going to see it.  This is a good opportunity for you as a parent to discuss things like these with your kids.  If you have strong arguments as to why Maddie's politics are incorrect, you should be able to explain them, in simple terms, to your kids.  Be an example of political civility.  Show how people who disagree politically should communicate with each other in a healthy way.  Let your kids walk way with an even greater message: no matter where you stand on the political lines, we should always engage with each other with respect and openness.

Your girlfriend isn't forcing any ideology on them, she is simply talking about her own when asked and giving them opportunities to get involved/educated it seems like.\n\nAs a side note, if her ideology is so opposed to your own and you take such issue with her activism you should probably question whether or not the relationship is going to work. what will you do if you two have kids of your own in the future and want to raise them in completely different ways?", "I'm getting fascist Capt.

I think you missed an opportunity to have some measured conversations with the girls about hard topics, which is a bummer because kids need to hear both sides of an issue, and would have been an opportunity to model respectfully discussing values with people who hold opposing views. I'm giving you a ~~NTA~~ because of the \\*continued\\* boundary crossing. And the girls might be sad, but keep in mind, they are old enough to understand that parents do have boundaries that need to be respected for their own safety. (edited to ESH. The more I think about it, you need to come to grips that this world is a shitty place to be a woman right now.

To give a bit more info, I'm not originally from the U.S., and during the time period this movie was produced, there was alot of political turmoil, mainly anger about supposed corruption. There were alot of claims about the corruption, so the movie makers wanted to make money off of this sentiment so they could profit off of people's blind anti-government and revolutionary sentiment. The movie was also very silly and straw-manned a high ranking government official to make him look sociopathic, even comparing him to imperialists in one scene\n\nThe film, very disengenously, likens past revolutionaries who fought bravely and gave their life to the country to a bunch of dumb college kids who learn about these brave men and women, get emotional and kill a government member because of some perceived injustice, completely misapplying the revolutionary's ideals. In my opinion, the revolutionaries are a false equivalency designed to spread propaganda and make the kids in the movie look like heroes.

But it is best to experience life with your children and talk to them about it, than try to hide them from it. \n\nThe youngest is 12 and the oldest is 16. This is the BEST time to be watching controversial things with them so you can talk them through why certain decisions are right and wrong. \n\nBut you can also acknowledge the emotions that lead to these decisions. This could be peak parenting time for you to naturally broach a lot of the difficult issues your children are already going through! \n\nAnd yes. They are already going through difficult things. \n\nI don\u2019t understand adults who try to create idyllic childhoods for their kids. Even if they have an objectively great childhood, children experience emotional things. Whatever that is (big or small) for their world. And it causes big feelings. No childhood is all sunshine and rainbows. (Everyone has a boo boo at least once! \ud83d\ude09)\n\nI remember even innocent teasing could feel like the worst bullying at that age, for example. Your kids are little *people*. Not little happy robots that you can keep programmed that way. \n\nFrom what you say, Maddie gets that and is a keeper. I think you can be better.

If they're already influenced by a little bit of your girlfriend, they're not going to swing the way you want them to and good for them that they can make up their own minds despite you trying to keep them ignorant to the world. Let them decide for themselves. It's not like they couldn't be aware of political strife even if they weren't in the US. All my international friends are eating the nonsense up that happens here because it's so unbelievable to them. \n\nIf your kids are so easily swayed, I can imagine exactly all the things you disagree with. If basic human rights are so upsetting to you should think about your own world views. You're never too old to change. YTA though. And probably single. And if you step on those kids too much, who knows where you are once they're out of your home.", "I mean, there's lots of Indian films that have a political message, very often patriotic or nationalist.
