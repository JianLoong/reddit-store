{"id": 9811, "submission_id": "110sa1h", "title": "AITA for giving my SAHM wife a written performance review with suggested areas needing improvement?", "selftext": "I (33m) share one child (6f) with my wife (36f). She has another daughter (13f) that lives with us full time, we also have custody of our niece (15f). The teens are each other\u2019s best friends, they share a large bedroom which was done at their request. The dynamic here is pretty much mom and youngest against the teens, with me being the referee between everyone. \n\nMy wife has taught the youngest, she can blame others for her actions to avoid consequences. She just says the word, one of the teens will get punished without question. There\u2019s no doubt, she is my wife\u2019s favorite. I love her, but she\u2019s becoming nothing more than an entitled brat. As just a mere example, my wife and I had an appointment we both needed to attend. When we came back, it was apparent the pool had been used. They\u2019re not allowed to swim while we aren\u2019t home. \n\nAs the youngest divulged, \u201cMommy I was in my room coloring, I never went swimming.\u201d The teens said that was not true, she had gone swimming as well. Only the teens were punished, my wife refused to give the youngest any type of consequence. I later found her wet swimming suit hidden in the garage. My wife and I argued, I felt strongly she needed to not only be punished for swimming, but also for lying. After a relentless disagreement, I was silenced as she gave the youngest a very minimal consequence. \n\nThe lying, blaming and favoritism ultimately caused the teens to act out, understandably. Most of their consequences are done by giving more chores, specifically the chores the 6 year old has. Or as recent, they were removed from music lessons as a consequence. I believe they\u2019re so frustrated they don\u2019t even care when they verbally attack their mother after her unfair treatment towards them. After all, they already get blamed and punished for things they don\u2019t even do, from my perspective lashing out gives them a release. \n\nWe\u2019ve have had countless, tiring arguments. She\u2019d either not see her faults, or we\u2019d agree to do this and that, but it was never actually done. I decided to write her a performance review, as a SAHM. Her areas in need of improvement, well it was a lot. But I touched on how she needs to listen better, stop being biased. Be fair in all her decisions, stop making rash decisions without taking all three kids into consideration. I recommended her to give each child the same amount of one-on-one alone time to speak, or just be with one another. \n\nSo it wouldn\u2019t be an entirely slap to her face, I gave her accolades on her strong points for other areas aside from parenting. I guess I felt this would work best, because I could organize my thoughts on paper without her interjecting. However, it quickly backfired in my face. She was quiet the first hour after I handed it to her. Then she completely exploded on me, said if we\u2019re going to do this type shit she\u2019ll get a private bank account and take half my paycheck every week. She further said the review was abusive, and a manipulative sexist move.

The concerns you have are legitimate and it needs an urgent solution. But, the way you went about it is really unhealthy. The parenting of your children is not a project.

If it has come to this point I'd really suggest professional help, there is no shame in needing some help. \n\nBased on how you describe the situation I'd agree that she has parenting flaws that need to be addressed, so I'm not saying you're the bad guy here, but at the end of the day you both need to handle this conflict like adults.", "ESH.

But more you for one, the performance and review and two, for having the idea that a six year old should face the same consequences as two teens for something like swimming unsupervised. The teens have the critical thinking skills to make that decision. The six year old? \"Yay! I get to go swimming.\" Presumably the teens were in charge of their younger sibling. They instigated the behavior and yes, should have more severe consequences. It is NOT entitled brat behavior for a six year old to join her siblings swimming and then try to hide the evidence or even lie about it once it becomes clear they did something wrong.

You gave a boarderline abusive woman more ammo to DARVO you, by power playing her when you shouldn't have. \n\nPerformance reviews are given by employers, educators, and people with higher status and power, not equals - so in this instance, she's right. Can she start splitting your assets down the middle if we're getting transactional now?

She has another daughter (13f) that lives with us full time, we also have custody of our niece (15f). The teens are each other\u2019s best friends, they share a large bedroom which was done at their request. The dynamic here is pretty much mom and youngest against the teens, with me being the referee between everyone. \n\nMy wife has taught the youngest, she can blame others for her actions to avoid consequences. She just says the word, one of the teens will get punished without question. There\u2019s no doubt, she is my wife\u2019s favorite. I love her, but she\u2019s becoming nothing more than an entitled brat. As just a mere example, my wife and I had an appointment we both needed to attend. When we came back, it was apparent the pool had been used. They\u2019re not allowed to swim while we aren\u2019t home. \n\nAs the youngest divulged, \u201cMommy I was in my room coloring, I never went swimming.\u201d The teens said that was not true, she had gone swimming as well. Only the teens were punished, my wife refused to give the youngest any type of consequence. I later found her wet swimming suit hidden in the garage. My wife and I argued, I felt strongly she needed to not only be punished for swimming, but also for lying. After a relentless disagreement, I was silenced as she gave the youngest a very minimal consequence. \n\nThe lying, blaming and favoritism ultimately caused the teens to act out, understandably. Most of their consequences are done by giving more chores, specifically the chores the 6 year old has. Or as recent, they were removed from music lessons as a consequence. I believe they\u2019re so frustrated they don\u2019t even care when they verbally attack their mother after her unfair treatment towards them. After all, they already get blamed and punished for things they don\u2019t even do, from my perspective lashing out gives them a release. \n\nWe\u2019ve have had countless, tiring arguments. She\u2019d either not see her faults, or we\u2019d agree to do this and that, but it was never actually done. I decided to write her a performance review, as a SAHM. Her areas in need of improvement, well it was a lot. But I touched on how she needs to listen better, stop being biased. Be fair in all her decisions, stop making rash decisions without taking all three kids into consideration. I recommended her to give each child the same amount of one-on-one alone time to speak, or just be with one another. \n\nSo it wouldn\u2019t be an entirely slap to her face, I gave her accolades on her strong points for other areas aside from parenting. I guess I felt this would work best, because I could organize my thoughts on paper without her interjecting. However, it quickly backfired in my face. She was quiet the first hour after I handed it to her. Then she completely exploded on me, said if we\u2019re going to do this type shit she\u2019ll get a private bank account and take half my paycheck every week. She further said the review was abusive, and a manipulative sexist move. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Maybe she should be a woman and own up to her BS", "His wife refuses therapy", "She won\u2019t go to therapy, I\u2019ve tried multiple times to getting us all to go. As far as the punishment goes, I\u2019ll pass out one to the youngest. She without fail goes behind me and undoes it. I\u2019ve grounded our kid for a week, she goes directly to her mom and gets, \u201cNo, we\u2019re not doing that.\u201d", "Maybe if she gets suspended from this job, she can go to a spa for a few days.", "This, but my judgement is ESH, the wife has her own share of faults", "How is the wife not the AH here for her blatant favoritism? He\u2019s not her owner, he doesn\u2019t get to \u201callow\u201d or \u201cdisallow\u201d her behavior. All he can do is keep having arguments with her until she changes, while continuing to try and protect his kids from her behavior.", "They need to get couples counseling stat.", "I agree with you. The question is how does he get her to hear and respect his perspective. If half of what he wrote is true, they\u2019ve hit communication and parenting issues and their kids will be writing in these threads for the rest of their lives.", "OP has tried everything, conversations, suggestions for therapy, evidence of the six yr old manipulative behavior, reasoning and nothing works so far. \n\nAt this point is time to try whatever works, and see what sticks", "Yeah you should read it.

They were presumably left in charge of the 6-year-old and either let her swim or left her alone long enough for her to go by herself.", "Yeah, if that's the example he gave of his wife favoring the youngest, I'm not sure I trust his judgment. The older girls were in charge and they are more responsible for violating the no swimming rule than the youngest is. I don't agree with her not being punished at all, but that doesn't seem like favoritism or emotional abuse as other commenters are saying. I don't think we have enough information to judge the wife, but we definitely have enough to judge the husband. That said, everyone here should get threapy.", "This. The 6 year old was not in charge and certainly didn\u2019t initiate. Absolutely inappropriate to punish her for something that was certainly the fault of the older girls.", "Yea exactly I don\u2019t think OP is really making sense in that example which makes me question their issues. A 6 year old obviously shouldn\u2019t get in trouble for what their babysitters permitted. They need to have a discussion about lying but why would a 6 year old be punished in this situation? I\u2019d take the pool thing seriously because water safety is really important especially when your babysitting a little kid I would probably react harshly for that one.\n\nAs for spending equal amounts of time with each kid I\u2019m sorry but no, a 6 year old has vastly different needs and wants than a teenager. The teens probably don\u2019t want that equal time. I think maybe a nice activity like going to lunch or getting nails done together once a week or month whatever works with the schedule is nice but let\u2019s be realistic it\u2019s not the mom favoring a 6 year old by spending more time with them it\u2019s just different needs.\n\nAlso teenagers and parents go through phases where they don\u2019t get along, teens are too cool, or know everything etc. It happens. I\u2019m wondering if OP is being harsh on his wife for this happening. Either way I think writing a \u201cperformance review\u201d for wife is an AH move. Your her partner not her boss, had OP written a letter to get his thoughts out and organized, fine, but a performance review? Yikes. Gives the impression you think you\u2019re the boss and know best and that\u2019s just not the way marriage works wife has every right to be pissed about that.\n\nETA: YTA", "But the 6yo knew the rules which she very well demonstrated by lying and showing forethought by hiding her suit in the garage. That's deliberate and deserves proper consequences. \n\nFor the swimming I'm not so sure about, per reasons you listed, but a nominal punishment that's age appropriate (maybe no screentime that day) probably wouldn't have gone amiss. At least a serious talking to about safety was required.", "Then he can go alone. It\u2019s not a group project", "The MIL fucking with things is also a problem.", "Yeah I get the idea that he has the same standards for conduct and punishments for the 6 yr old and the teens and that's not appropriate. He needs to take some parenting classes or read up on what developmentally appropriate rules and punishments are for kids.", "He treated his wife like an employee.

It\u2019s only fair that she does because this is very one-sided.", "NTA\n\nYou tried everything else from conversations to suggestions for therapy and she refuses to listen and won't change her behavior.\n\nGrandes males, grandes remedios\n\nBig problems need radical solutions", "Then YOU go... your kids GO.

Writing the performance review was a bad decision, but as the other replies say, take yourself to a therapist, take your kids etc, but doing nothing isn\u2019t going to work. Perhaps when you apologize for this, you can sit her down and ask her to consider counselling again and explain why it might help your marriage and the family unit.", "Given that your wife thinks there\u2019s nothing wrong with her approach, if she want to therapy she\u2019d likely start using what she learns to double speak the rest of you.

But how did you think treating your wife like you\u2019re employee would help?\n\nI am very sympathetic to you. But this was a baffling decision.\n\nAnd some of your criticisms are off base. A six year old needs one-on-one parenting much more than teenagers. A six year old breaking the rules about the pool should have different consequences than a teenager. It seems you think it should all be equal. And you\u2019re wife is going the other extreme.", "This is the only reason YTA edges out ESH for me.", "I doubt his therapist advised him to present her with a \"performance review\". Writing down your thoughts would be ok, but the way he presented it had predictable results. Maybe she doesn't think she needs therapy & maybe she's right, but they need to resolve their communication issues & how to deal with parenting disagreements.\n\nHe didn't ask for judgement of the parenting, just the \"performance review\", which was an AH move.", "Take the kids to therapy without her then.", "You grounded a SIX year old for a week?\n\nYour wife may be unfair to the teenagers, but you're unfair to the SIX year old. What did she do that merited a week's grounding?\n\nAlso, a 6 year old should not face the same punishment for swimming as the teens. Because she does not have the critical thinking skills. They were in charge.", "Go to therapy by yourself for some advice.  This is not healthy and no way to have a relationship or even coparent.", "Grounding a 6 yo for a week as a punishment sounds like overkill. You need to think about her age and developmental stage", "Sorry to hear that and good to know that you at least tried to solve that situation in a healthier way. Still think the performance review was a terrible idea and I hope you find a way to reconnect with your wife and improve your family life!", "Too bad she won't go to therapy. Maybe you'd benefit from getting some yourself.", "Ok. But as someone else suggested, if you and your wife can\u2019t can\u2019t agree on consequences, why don\u2019t do the same and reverse some of the teens\u2019 punishments?\nESH.\nShe shouldn\u2019t be playing favourites, but you should have approached this differently.\nBut I will say that it is a good thing that you are not automatically partial towards your biological child.", "You have a point, she\u2019s TA too so ESH.", "He treated her like he was her superior by writing a performance review.", "Agree -- but they both need to buy in, be willing to work with the other, and change if needed (which...it will be).", "He should probably start therapy for himself and probably the kids. If she refuses to stop favoring the youngest and refuses to do therapy, he can always leave. Given her behavior, he could probably get custody. It's not a great solution but her behavior is emotionally abusive to the older kids and she's teaching the youngest to be a lying, entitled brat who will likely grow into being an abuser herself unless someone intervenes.", "Nope condescension is never going to work a divorce would be In better taste", "Rightfully so, because conversations are not working, she refusing therapy, and OP has tried everything and is not working.", "There's no reality in which an unsolicited performance review of your partner is not an AH move.", "Nah anytime you write a performance review if your partner it\u2019s automatic AH.", "The 6yo flat out lied. How is that not on her? No matter how you slice it, the 6yo has issues. And let's not pretend that favoritism doesn't come into play in family dynamics and stuff like this is very common when blatant favoritism is shown. \n\nNTA. When calmly talking to his wife didn't work, and she refused therapy, OP escalated until she heard him. Her refusing to listen then threatening to take half his paycheck shows she doesn't see OP as an equal. He's a ATM to her and that's it.
