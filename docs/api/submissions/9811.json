{"id": 9811, "submission_id": "110sa1h", "title": "AITA for giving my SAHM wife a written performance review with suggested areas needing improvement?", "selftext": "I (33m) share one child (6f) with my wife (36f). She has another daughter (13f) that lives with us full time, we also have custody of our niece (15f). The teens are each other\u2019s best friends, they share a large bedroom which was done at their request. The dynamic here is pretty much mom and youngest against the teens, with me being the referee between everyone. \n\nMy wife has taught the youngest, she can blame others for her actions to avoid consequences. She just says the word, one of the teens will get punished without question. There\u2019s no doubt, she is my wife\u2019s favorite. I love her, but she\u2019s becoming nothing more than an entitled brat. As just a mere example, my wife and I had an appointment we both needed to attend. When we came back, it was apparent the pool had been used. They\u2019re not allowed to swim while we aren\u2019t home. \n\nAs the youngest divulged, \u201cMommy I was in my room coloring, I never went swimming.\u201d The teens said that was not true, she had gone swimming as well. Only the teens were punished, my wife refused to give the youngest any type of consequence. I later found her wet swimming suit hidden in the garage. My wife and I argued, I felt strongly she needed to not only be punished for swimming, but also for lying. After a relentless disagreement, I was silenced as she gave the youngest a very minimal consequence. \n\nThe lying, blaming and favoritism ultimately caused the teens to act out, understandably. Most of their consequences are done by giving more chores, specifically the chores the 6 year old has. Or as recent, they were removed from music lessons as a consequence. I believe they\u2019re so frustrated they don\u2019t even care when they verbally attack their mother after her unfair treatment towards them. After all, they already get blamed and punished for things they don\u2019t even do, from my perspective lashing out gives them a release. \n\nWe\u2019ve have had countless, tiring arguments. She\u2019d either not see her faults, or we\u2019d agree to do this and that, but it was never actually done. I decided to write her a performance review, as a SAHM. Her areas in need of improvement, well it was a lot. But I touched on how she needs to listen better, stop being biased. Be fair in all her decisions, stop making rash decisions without taking all three kids into consideration. I recommended her to give each child the same amount of one-on-one alone time to speak, or just be with one another. \n\nSo it wouldn\u2019t be an entirely slap to her face, I gave her accolades on her strong points for other areas aside from parenting. I guess I felt this would work best, because I could organize my thoughts on paper without her interjecting. However, it quickly backfired in my face. She was quiet the first hour after I handed it to her. Then she completely exploded on me, said if we\u2019re going to do this type shit she\u2019ll get a private bank account and take half my paycheck every week. She further said the review was abusive, and a manipulative sexist move.

The concerns you have are legitimate and it needs an urgent solution. But, the way you went about it is really unhealthy. The parenting of your children is not a project.

If it has come to this point I'd really suggest professional help, there is no shame in needing some help. \n\nBased on how you describe the situation I'd agree that she has parenting flaws that need to be addressed, so I'm not saying you're the bad guy here, but at the end of the day you both need to handle this conflict like adults.", "ESH.

But more you for one, the performance and review and two, for having the idea that a six year old should face the same consequences as two teens for something like swimming unsupervised. The teens have the critical thinking skills to make that decision. The six year old? \"Yay! I get to go swimming.\" Presumably the teens were in charge of their younger sibling. They instigated the behavior and yes, should have more severe consequences. It is NOT entitled brat behavior for a six year old to join her siblings swimming and then try to hide the evidence or even lie about it once it becomes clear they did something wrong.

You gave a boarderline abusive woman more ammo to DARVO you, by power playing her when you shouldn't have. \n\nPerformance reviews are given by employers, educators, and people with higher status and power, not equals - so in this instance, she's right. Can she start splitting your assets down the middle if we're getting transactional now?

She has another daughter (13f) that lives with us full time, we also have custody of our niece (15f). The teens are each other\u2019s best friends, they share a large bedroom which was done at their request. The dynamic here is pretty much mom and youngest against the teens, with me being the referee between everyone. \n\nMy wife has taught the youngest, she can blame others for her actions to avoid consequences. She just says the word, one of the teens will get punished without question. There\u2019s no doubt, she is my wife\u2019s favorite. I love her, but she\u2019s becoming nothing more than an entitled brat. As just a mere example, my wife and I had an appointment we both needed to attend. When we came back, it was apparent the pool had been used. They\u2019re not allowed to swim while we aren\u2019t home. \n\nAs the youngest divulged, \u201cMommy I was in my room coloring, I never went swimming.\u201d The teens said that was not true, she had gone swimming as well. Only the teens were punished, my wife refused to give the youngest any type of consequence. I later found her wet swimming suit hidden in the garage. My wife and I argued, I felt strongly she needed to not only be punished for swimming, but also for lying. After a relentless disagreement, I was silenced as she gave the youngest a very minimal consequence. \n\nThe lying, blaming and favoritism ultimately caused the teens to act out, understandably. Most of their consequences are done by giving more chores, specifically the chores the 6 year old has. Or as recent, they were removed from music lessons as a consequence. I believe they\u2019re so frustrated they don\u2019t even care when they verbally attack their mother after her unfair treatment towards them. After all, they already get blamed and punished for things they don\u2019t even do, from my perspective lashing out gives them a release. \n\nWe\u2019ve have had countless, tiring arguments. She\u2019d either not see her faults, or we\u2019d agree to do this and that, but it was never actually done. I decided to write her a performance review, as a SAHM. Her areas in need of improvement, well it was a lot. But I touched on how she needs to listen better, stop being biased. Be fair in all her decisions, stop making rash decisions without taking all three kids into consideration. I recommended her to give each child the same amount of one-on-one alone time to speak, or just be with one another. \n\nSo it wouldn\u2019t be an entirely slap to her face, I gave her accolades on her strong points for other areas aside from parenting. I guess I felt this would work best, because I could organize my thoughts on paper without her interjecting. However, it quickly backfired in my face. She was quiet the first hour after I handed it to her. Then she completely exploded on me, said if we\u2019re going to do this type shit she\u2019ll get a private bank account and take half my paycheck every week. She further said the review was abusive, and a manipulative sexist move. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The teens probably don\u2019t want that equal time. I think maybe a nice activity like going to lunch or getting nails done together once a week or month whatever works with the schedule is nice but let\u2019s be realistic it\u2019s not the mom favoring a 6 year old by spending more time with them it\u2019s just different needs.\n\nAlso teenagers and parents go through phases where they don\u2019t get along, teens are too cool, or know everything etc. It happens.

Firstly, I have an incredible ear ... my hearing is outstanding.  My kids could be in the rec room, with me upstairs in the kitchen, and I could pretty much describe what my kids were doing, at most moments, because I could hear them. I also was a fan of letting my older son, and daughter, work out conflicts themselves, because it would teach them invaluable social skills. I ALWAYS had an ear on them, and would intervene if it got too heated.\n\nMy friend and I were having a cuppa in the kitchen when kids were in the rec room.  I was listening, as usual, even as we talked. My daughter was going through a \"bite\" stage, and we were trying to cure it, which son knew.\n\nSuddenly, we hear son call, from the rec room \"Mom!  Daughter BIT me!\". And I responded \"Then quit bugging her.\". Friend burst into laughter because a loving Mom, like me, wouldn't just allow biting.\n\nBut, I had heard my son bugging the hell out of daughter leading up to her getting so frustrated that she bit him.  And it was more important, to me, to keep son from learning he could get his sister into trouble, when he had been a deliberate provocateur.  At that moment, teaching him this lesson was most important.\n\nI used to say that son's favorite form of entertainment was winding up his sister just to watch the fireworks.  But he never ever believed that I didn't know what was really happening, and she was never punished on his say so. Just as he wasn't punished on her say so.\n\nThey're grown.  He still taunts her, in good fun. She tackles him, adults romp around the house ... they laugh.  She still has the urge to bite, but as a toddler, it took us 2 weeks only to train her out of it.  I gave my son permission to bite her back, gently, on the arm.  It was a stroke of genius.  I knew what would happen.  She was so shocked and incredulous that he would retaliate, that she didn't bite again.", "ESH. Your wife has some pretty horrible parenting skills, to be fair. And I see where you were coming from.

As for the lying punishment on top of the swimming punishment, she hid her bathing suit to help her lie, that\u2019s a calculated move. People who learn how to lie so they can stay out of trouble, are the ones who wind up in prison. I know it\u2019s a stretch considering her age, but long term if this behavior isn\u2019t addressed, that\u2019s what happens.

She has to learn that her actions do have consequences, even if someone else suggested said action, she knew she shouldn\u2019t have gone swimming which is why she lied and hid her suit. She needs to know that lying is not ok, it ruins trust and she will eventually get caught, lying just postpones dealing with the consequences.

Mom had not said this, and I got in trouble for believing her. I still think that was incredibly unfair, especially since our mom KNEW my sister had tricked me.
