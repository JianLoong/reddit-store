Either you are right about your kid or not.  You kicked him out so we will never know.  \n\nYou sound like you despise him tho, which makes you an ah because you raised him.", "NTA - He seems insincere, kidney stones are painful but usually not fatal, it\u2019s hard to imagine him turning religious bc of that", "You are NTA for getting upset and not wanting a sideshow in the hospital.\n\nHowever, how could you pass on an opportunity to rejoinder and pray for part of everyone's well-being to be that your son becomes employed and starts paying rent and developing a future as an honest capable adult?", "NTA - you better than anybody know your sons bullshit.  Why fall for the latest iteration of it?\n\nAlso, not to downplay how much kidney stones suck\u2026but it\u2019s not exactly the type of event that triggers people to rediscover faith.  He should have saved this half baked plan for when somebody has a cancer scare or something with real gravity, haha", "NTA. His sudden interest in religion when you are hospitalized didn't play well with you. If he's that concerned he can pray for you anywhere other than your bedside.", "NTA\n\nHowever, I would not have bothered getting upset at the hospital.\n\nIf he asked for money after his dress-up-as-a-Hasid day, you could have given your same response \"Get a job\". Because what is he going to say to that? \"*I wore a talit so now you HAVE to give me money?*\"\n\nThat's the point when you could have have told him that he was being manipulative.\n\nPre-emptively saying what you did gives him the ability to play victim (\"*he accused me when I didn't do anything!*\").\n\nAnd - if he is going out - is it possible your wife is giving him money without your knowledge? I'd also give a time limit: you have X months to get a job and move out.\n\nHow long has he been unemployed and not in school? No able-bodied young person should be sitting around - there's tons of jobs out there, even part-time if he can't face committing himself to full-time.", "INFO: has he kept up his newfound reignition of his faith since you've been home? If not, it's pretty obvious you're right that he was trying to emotionally manipulate you, and doing it awfully.   \n\n\nDoes your wife also think he needs to get a job, and is just unhappy with what happened at the hospital, or does she support the kid no matter what?", "NTA\n\nBut I  can't fully call him an AH.  Honestly, it sounds like your son was engaging in performative religion. That's not okay.\n\nIf he showed up and quietly prayed, that's one thing. But a damn show is quite another.\n\nAt the same time, I might give him some grace.  Me personally? I don't go to church. I send \"best thoughts and good vibes\" when someone asks me to pray for someone I don't know.\n\nBut I do go to the Episcopal Cathedral and sit quietly with my own thoughts when I'm faced with a crisis. I also bust open the blue Hymnal and the Book of Common Prayer to find some comfort. But that's me settling in with my faith.\n\nMaybe that's what your son is doing? Looking for guidance?", "Sounds like a very odd situation. I think you should have let it play out to see if you were in the right or if your son was super worried about your condition. \n\nApologise for 'hurting his feelings' and see how soon after he asks you for money NTA", "NTA.

You don't respect your son, so you are suspect of his motives.  Your son may be \"lazy\" but you are a resentful enabler.  \n\nThe issue isn't about your son's hospital visit, which does seem like a manipulative stunt.  Your issue is your son lacks maturity and self-sufficiency but belittling him will not fix those issues. If your son is 20 years old and doesn't work or go to school, it's time for you and your wife (as a team) to start setting boundaries and have expectations and deadlines for him to get an education or training for a job, and to move out.", "OP, it's very bizarre, but you HAVE to understand that you and your wife are *why* he's lazy. \n\nYou're enabling his inability to be self-sufficient because you're infantilising him. And yet you're extremely resentful. \n\nYou all need to grow up and get family therapy. \n\nESH.", "Uhm, hard to judge how genuine he was without knowing him. But yeah, soft YTA for throwing him out, if nothing else, you could have let him finish the prayer and then said no to any money requests.", "YTA - in this isolated situation, it was wrong of you to assume the worst of your son. All else aside, if he is doing something nice and you automatically assume he is doing it out of ulterior motives, he has no reason to ever try to do anything nice again regardless of his motives. It seems like you may need to sort out your relationship with him outside of this situation.", "It seems you don\u2019t like you son.  Nothing you said reflects well on him in any way.  You appear to question his motives regarding prayer with no evidence that his intentions are good.  \nI can\u2019t absolve you.  Sounded like you have an attitude  that needs careful inspection and self reflection.", "YTA, oof, at least a little bit, and I'm sympathetic to you. Your son may be an asshole too, but why turn down something as harmless as a prayer?

If OP is correct, I would have absolutely let him pray for me though and when he eventually asked for money (likely soon), I would just say no.  Rejecting your child's kindness that wouldn't have lasting negative effects on you because you suspect they are being manipulative to get money is pointless.

Your role as a parent doesn't magically end at 18.
