I've been reluctant to tell my family about my relationship because of my moms religion. For context, I was raised LDS (Mormon) until I was 18 where I ended up leaving and coming out to my family as gay. I got a pretty neutral reaction of \"I'll always love you\" etc but still receive judgement for things such as drinking, getting a tattoo, or other small acts that go against the religious doctrines. \n\nAnyway, yesterday my mom showed up at my apartment (an hour away from her place) and started yelling at me that I've been lying to her and how untrustworthy I am now. I told her that I never wanted to lie to her I just felt uncomfortable telling her about my relationship with a man because of her religious beliefs. She started making comments about how i'm using her religion against her and just because the religion spews hate doesn't mean she is. I tried to explain that the principle of her still giving them money is still hard for me to swallow knowing the stuff they say about me being gay. \n\nShe ended up saying some stuff that rubbed me the wrong way such as; \"You don't get to use my religion against you when I don't use you going to hell against you\" which I feel like validated my feelings that there are unspoken feelings about how she feels about my sexuality. I ended up just ending the conversation and sending her away. \n\nFor some more context, my mom was in a super toxic marriage where she was getting cheated on for 20+ years without ever knowing. So I understand where some of the insecurity with people lying to her comes from but I still can't shake the feeling of the religious hatred still being tied to her. There was a lot more said back and forth about me lying and me saying it was due to religion I just simply didn't feel comfortable telling her about it. \n\nAITA for kicking my mom out of my apartment and using religion as an excuse for not telling her about my relationship.", "created_utc": 1676228310, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/110na5p/aita_for_not_telling_my_mom_about_my_relationship/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have a right to privacy.  You get to determine the time table that you will reveal your relationship to her on.  Unless you have done something like have your partner over to her house without her knowing or something like that, you do not have any obligation to tell her.", "NTA\n\nMan oh man\u2026 did she prove you were right. lol Sorry you have a narrow minded parent. My kids are all non-heterosexual (wide gambit of sexualities) & like I told them, your sex life & sexual desires are yours, not mine. You\u2019re my kid & everything that makes you, you I love. Except the bitchy behavior. I don\u2019t love that.\u201d", "NTA.\n\nSo some toxic Mormoninity.  Living here in mormidor I know exactly what that\u2019s like.  My wife actually left the church when they made it a choice between her and her gay son.  Apparently your mom has different priorities.  They are so full of shit.  \u201cFamilies are forever\u201d, unless your kid is gay, or questions doctrine, or leaves the church.  \n\nI\u2019m going to tell you the same thing I tell every kid who\u2019s parents reject them because or who they are.  If your parents reject you, OK we are your parents now.  We love you and we are proud of you.", "NTA --- Where does it say you have to tell your parents your in a relationship? and her turning up at your home and accusing you of \"lying\"  about it just proves you were right not telling her.", "NTA\n\nWhen she found out she drive an hour to flipped out. That seems to justify not telling her everything. So does talking about going to hell. It's not \"using her religion against her\" when she is using her religion to judge you. That is both before and after she found out.\n\nA lot of people don't share a lot of about their relationship until things get super serious regardless of the religious baggage of the parents. I guess she might get some points for not going full excommunication on you but that might just because they expect you to come back.", "\"You don't get to use my religion against you when I don't use you going to hell against you\"\n\nNTA\n\nIt's not an excuse if it literally just happened, it's the truth.\n\nEdit to add: It's your business what relationship you are in and who you choose to tell about it.", "NTA. Her comments about not 'using' you going to Hell seem to validate your concerns. The fact that she has that judgemental hatred but keeps it (mostly) under wraps is probably exactly why you didn't feel comfortable telling her in the first place. She keeps her judgments mostly to herself which is a good first step, but I can totally see how you would not want to be judged, even if it's in secret.", "NTA my father still doesnt know i\u2019m gay or about the guys i was/am dating. I dont want him to worry about me going to hell or bore me with religious bs. My sister, mother and friends know though. Ah and they even met my current guy just it\u2019s not advertised we are fwb", "NTA - first off i\u2019m sorry this happened to you. Second you are not obligated in any way to come out to someone or disclose your private life!!! Your mom reaffirmed your greatest fear. The \u201cuse you going to hell against you\u201d line is a hell of a thing to say to your child\u2026 nonetheless it\u2019s still sweet and shows maturity on your end to try and understand why she may have reacted the way she did. Respectfully, what the fuck does her getting cheated on have to do with you being apprehensive about being shunned or insulted by family? I want to say talk to her about this calmly, which is always an option, but if she is shunning smaller things IE drinking, tattoos and whatever else. It doesn\u2019t bode well. You deserve better king! Hope your relationship stays healthy!", "NTA. Her behavior is toxic. A normal reaction would be \u201cI\u2019m so heartbroken that you didn\u2019t trust me enough to tell me.\u201d Yelling and screaming about how YOU somehow broke HER trust is not normal.\n\nHer past marriage is unfortunate, but it is not okay for her to take those issues out on you. Framing a decision her adult son made about his own life and happiness as an insult to her is narcissistic. Like, imagine a mom throwing a tantrum saying, \u201cYou know I hate parsnips. I can\u2019t believe you would ever eat parsnips given how much I hate them. I can never trust you again! You obviously don\u2019t care about me at all!\u201d Your decision to eat parsnips or be in a relationship has no relation to her issues, no matter how much she wants to pretend it does. \n\nThe bottom line is, if you raise children to adulthood and they don\u2019t feel safe telling you something, that\u2019s on you as a parent, not on the children. She is the reason you didn\u2019t feel safe, and her reaction proves that you were smart to not tell her sooner.", "NTA. My life is not open for discussion mom. Get over it.", "Tbh she just a basic Mormon, but NTA for your question.", "Soft esh- everyone is hurting here. Bottom line, your mom thought you had a closer relationship and is hurt because you didn\u2019t share an important relationship in your life.  You were worried that she would never fully accept you so you never gave her the opportunity to show you.  She said things I am sure she regrets, and I think you probably regret things too.  One thing that seems pretty apparent is that she loves you and you love her.  She may have her own issues that she\u2019s needs to work out with her religion- but let that be her worry, not yours.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This may have to be a case of you'll have to agree to disagree.  \n\nReligion is very strong in your mother and she will likely not be able to back down over this so it may be a relationship doomed to failure.  It's actually quite heartbreaking to hear of parents who will walk away from their kids over their religious views.\n\nYou are an adult that has a right to privacy.  Your mother has no right to dictate what you can and can't do. She's very much in the wrong here.\n\nActually you reminded me of what my mother did to me once.  I was like 22 and had moved out to my dad's at 21 and then out with my then boyfriend at 22 and I knew she would not like that or tolerate that.  So I didn't tell her.  Well one day she turned up on my door step with my stepdad in tow and my then, like 10 year old, brother.  Only to berate me about living in sin etc.  I just stood there.  Eventually she left.  There was nothing she could do and there was no point in losing my crap over it... not sure how I didn't but probably because I was brought up being told you don't talk back.  But what I didn't get over was her bringing my kid brother along.  Nothing to do with him!", "If she continues on in a religion that is homophobic she is condoning their view. If she did not condone that view she would seek out a different religion that does not discriminate. Turn off the tracker.", "NTA You are a legal adult and you do not live at home, she has no legal or moral right to know anything about your private life. Not telling her about your relationships is not lying, it is enforcing much needed boundaries. It sounds like if she is coming around to your apartment saying all this stuff to you, you need even more rules in place.", "Sorry should have clarified better in the post -- Haven't lived with my mom since I was 18 and left the church. I've been spending the night at his place a lot recently and she's been tracking my location to see that. I think that's how she found out.", "Um, she\u2019s tracking your location? How is she doing that?  Because that\u2019s very abusive.", "This doesn't really change anything, but I would say it is kinda weird that you would have location tracking on with your mother, but you wouldn't disclose you were in a relationship with somebody.  Again, not saying you are an asshole or have any obligation to do so, but it just strikes me as odd that you would be \"okay\" with her knowing where you are at all times, but not that you are seeing someone romantically.   It's like a person that wears a COVID mask on a motorcycle without a helmet.  Your risk assessment just seems off.", "Oof, yeah... time to cut off the location tracking. I'm sure you're trying to be kind to her/ease her anxiety or whatever by allowing this, but those are her feelings to manage. And she's lost the privilege of having this much unrestricted access to your life.\n\nEta for judgment. NTA", "Yeah.. OP, you're entitled to your privacy and space especially as a legal adult lol you were honest about your feelings and didn't hold religion against her. \n\nI get you're just trying to maintain the peace within your family (I know it all too well), but parenting needs to evolve and grow as you do. It might be a blind spot for your Mom but it's worth having a chat to set boundaries and possibly provide a transition for Mom's peace of mind. \n\nNTA by a long shot.", "NTA. Your relationship is your business, especially if you feel she will not be accepting of your partner or you because of her religion. She can't have it both ways. If she is supportive of you being gay, she would not be telling you that you are going to hell. If she is not supportive of you being gay, you don't need to bring her criticism into your life by keeping her informed of what is going on in your life.", "NTA. She's made her choices, now she has to live with them.", "NTA\n\nWhat? You are 22. Why should you tell your mom about your relationships? You aren't a kid anymore", "You feel guilty about this specifically because the LDS is, in many ways, a cult. You've left the religion, but it still has enough of a hold on you that you feel guilty about things like \"protecting yourself from your homophobic and potentially verbally abusive mother.\" \n\nNTA.", "\n\n>Except the bitchy behavior\n\nThat made me lol. Love it, and I love that you just love them for who they are. You are the parent everyone deserves!", "I can't agree with you here. \n\n>You were worried that she would never fully accept you so you never gave her the opportunity to show you\n\nHer comments seem to confirm OP's suspicions and confirm exactly what he feared. My knee jerk reaction to her comments would have been \"and THIS is exactly why I didn't tell you.\" Yeah, it was hurtful to her, but OP seems to know her well enough to know almost exactly how she'd react. I highly doubt that she in any way regrets what she said.", "Wow, ok, that's a hard no. Time to turn off that tracking. OP, you have the right to establish healthy boundaries and as an adult, you have the right to not be tracked."]}
