I told my step father that my kids will no longer be allowed to stay over for sleepovers if this is the information they are being fed, until she gets some help & that they could go over for a few hours a week supervised by my him and he said that I am wrong for this and that my mother doesn\u2019t deserve me distancing myself and my kids from her.

To me it sounds wise and responsible to keep the kids separate, or at least have supervised (by you! your stepdad is not enough given his opinions on this) visits, probably at a neutral place like a park or playground.\n\nYou could also ask your doctor what you can do to support your mum, and if they have any suggestions/resources for families who are dealing with mental health issues, or how to explain things to young children. Not only does this help you get info, but then you also have it on record that you're concerned and reaching out for support.

Dates and times if you have phone calls/texts to log, and keep screenshots of everything you can. It sounds over the top, but you might find it really helpful if your mum keeps refusing help and you need to show health care professionals what is being said/done in private, yk?\n\nThere might not be a whole lot you can do if her husband isn't on board.
