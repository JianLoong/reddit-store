He took us up to the 3rd floor and introduced us to a bunch of people. I told them a bit about myself and eventually someone asked my BF what he does. He told them about his job and there was an uncomfortable silence. I joked that he\u2019s a \u201csimple man\u201d which is why I\u2019m with him. There was laughter and the situation seemed less tense.\n\nWell when we left the event we had a big argument. He said that it was insulting of me to describe him as simple and that I was clearly embarrassed to be associated with him at all. He said that I had straight up mocked him in front of everyone to make myself feel better.
