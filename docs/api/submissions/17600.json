{"id": 17600, "submission_id": "13lag4u", "title": "AITA for refusing to wear heels as a bridesmaid in my friend's wedding?", "selftext": "Hi Reddit. \n\nMy (24F) friend \"Abby\" (25F) is getting married and I could not be more happy for her. About a month ago, I was asked to be a bridesmaid, alongside 5 other girls and I accepted. We didn't hear any details until recently. \n\nLast week, Abby invited us over to her home for a \"bridesmaid meeting\" where she went over her expectations for us. During this, she went over the dress code: long black dresses with nude heels. Cool, I can do that. However, things took an unexpected turn. \n\nAbby said that what she wanted, in terms of the look of the bridal party, was that she wanted to look the shortest, compared to the rest of us. Meaning that we were all required to wear heels that would make us look taller than her. For reference, the other girls in the bridal party are either already taller than her, roughly the same height as her, or slightly shorter than her. I am the shortest out of the entire group. Abby is 5'6 and I am 5'1, meaning that in order to meet her expectations, I would have to go out and buy 6 inch heels. \n\nHere is where this becomes a problem. I have Pes Planus, more commonly known as flat feet. My feet don't have arches on them. Because I don't have proper supports on my feet, they strain easily and cause muscle cramps, specifically if I'm not wearing proper shoes and standing too long with them. Both my doctor and a podiatrist that I had seen recommended that when it comes to heels, I stick to the 1-2 inch range, which I do. Occasionally, I will do 3 inches, if I'm going to be sitting down for longer periods of time. There is no possible way I could do 6 inches. In addition to this, I also have mild bunions on both feet, so I would have to find a wider heel. \n\nThe frustrating thing is that Abby knows this. I've talked about it. She's seen it. I went up to her later and expressed my concerns, and asked if I could wear 3 inch heels instead due to my feet. She refused and said that if I was a true friend, I would wear the 6 inches and not make a fuss about it. She also said I was being selfish by not considering \"what the bride wants.\" I then asked her if I could change shoes during the reception. She said no, and that the only time I we could take off our shoes was when we were sitting down, but whenever we were standing, we would have to wear the heels, since she wants to look the shortest the entire day. I was mortified. \n\nWhen I expressed my frustrations to the rest of my bridesmaids, most of them were understanding  and thought that her rule was weird, but a few said that I was being kinda selfish, and not considering the bride's happiness, and I should be able to go through \"a little bit of pain\" for her.   \nNow I'm conflicted and wondering if I should have just kept my mouth shut. I am considering dropping out as a bridesmaid, but I'm worried how Abby would react.

As someone with pancake flat feet I can definitely sympathize with the woes certain footwear gives, even if not your specific circumstances, and that even an hour in bad shoes can make my feet hurt all day long even after switching, so that really was a compromise offer IMO, and a reasonable one.\n\nThe only thing I will say is that I know people who don't have chronic pain or conditions like this (And to be sure, 'flat feet' is on the very low end of the scale there) just *don't get how much it can hurt*, so the bride might *think* you are making mountains of mole hills, but I know you aren't, and you are definitely NTA here.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I wear super tall platform crocs LOL since my partner is a giant and I can\u2019t reach anything. That said I have feet issues too and KNOW heels aren\u2019t for me but platforms I can handle\u2026\n\nIf you can maybe wear something more platform style would be an excellent compromise so everyone\u2019s happy? As in tall but not so heely. Helly. Same difference to me! \ud83d\ude02 If not for whatever reason , then tell her you don\u2019t wanna lose a friend over shoes but it hurts so no. She\u2019s not a *incredibly rude swear HERE* if she doesn\u2019t know how bad it hurts you- not just even uncomfortable. \n\nBut if she does realize how badly it\u2019ll hurt you,then the shoe fits for the Asshole title. Best of luck , OP!", "NTA. What a horrible friend.\n\n\u2014 adult who\u2019s had flat feet since childhood. can\u2019t even wear 1 inch heeled boots for a few hours without it hurting for the rest of the day once they\u2019re off.", "NTA I\u2019m sure you could find some kind of 6\u201d platform/wedge that would be moderately comfortable if you really want to be a part of her wedding, but I\u2019m willing to bet this won\u2019t be the last of her crazy demands so I\u2019d just get out now and save your time and money", "NTA, if you really want to attend get some platform boots and spray them nude. You could probably find a pair that are flat, but make you 6\u201d taller.", "NTA. I\u2019d tell her I\u2019d wear six inch heels for pictures, but that for the rest I\u2019d be in 2-3 inch heels. Make sure she knows that\u2019s your final offer, and that your podiatrist has said you should not attend the wedding otherwise.", "NTA. Lots of suggestions to drop out and I agree.

NTA.\n\nThere is NO. NONE. NADA. etiquette, social norm, fealty oath, bond of sisterhood/friendship that EVER says \"because I am getting married, I get a get-out-of-basic decency card\". There is no excuse; her wedding is not an excuse for her to not give a $hit what kind of pain you would be in. NO TRUE FRIEND would value \"a look\" over causing real physical pain to her friend (or anyone, really).\n\nIf she wanted tall bridesmaids, she should have only asked women that are at least her height. She doesn't care about you, the person. She just needs people to be props in her wedding tableau. Tell her to get a 6-inch taller cutout of you to fill in your spot. She does not deserve your friendship for actually and intentionally expecting you to suffer at all, much less for such a stupid reason.", "NTA.

Okay that\u2019s just ridiculous. Does she know how tall SIX inch heels are??\n\nNo, because if she knew how tall the shoes actually are, she'd realise that the height boost is less than the size of the heel, and she'd be pushing for a nine inch heel to guarantee being the shortest.\n\nIf this is real, it's just bizarre. 5'6 is such a normal, middle of the road height for a woman. If I had to guess the height of a woman who didn't have hang ups in either direction about her height, that's what I'd go for.", "This right here ^ is the answer.", "I have basically zero feet problems other than ankles that have been sprained several times doing sports.\n\nEven I couldn\u2019t stand in 6\u201d heels.

I'd drop out, too. She's going to be a huge PITA.", "If you want to break your ankles fast, they're a great way, especially if you're not used to wearing them."]}
