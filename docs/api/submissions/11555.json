All of us who work here are teenagers, aside from the owners of course, so I just ask one of the girls.\n\nThe store was closed yesterday, all my coworkers went in, ordered pizza, and just hung out and watched Netflix all day. I wasn't told. It was the owner's son who organized it and invited everyone.\n\nI was upset that I wasn't invited, and asked him about it during my next shift, he just said \u201cyou avoid me and all the other guys, the rest of us are friends\u201d \n\nWhile there's multiple keys to the store, there's only one key to the kitchen. I threw it away. They had a big catering order to make, along with regular customers. His parents looked at the cameras to find it and saw me, they're really upset with me, but not their son.

Yeah, huge asshole.  They are going to fire you. And I would come after you, well your parents since you\u2019re 16, and make you/them pay for the re-keying the door.", "Oh, YTA.

Is he obligated to be friendly to you outside of work just because you're you? No. You make the workplace somewhat hostile and so he rightfully didn't invite you to a party. \n\nYou're not the asshole for feeling uncomfortable around people, you're the asshole for believing your coworkers MUST include you and stealing and throwing away a key to your workplace. \n\nIf you haven't already been fired you should expect it soon", "If real, YTA. Get a bit of maturity. Also, you should try to get comfortable around males, they make up roughly half of the world's population. If you don't, don't expect to be invited anywhere by the same males you never talk to, because you actively avoiding them actually makes them uncomfortable around you", "YTA. Also, this can't be real, but if it is, it's why teens shouldn't be on here.", "They're friends and you're clearly not a friend of them which isn't that surprising.

Of course YTA.", "So, OP\u2019s reaction to not getting invited to a pizza party because she is uncomfortable around males and goes out of her way to avoid them at work is to have a fit and throw away the only key and screw up her employer\u2019s ability to fulfill a big order? If OP is uncomfortable around males\u2014and it shows\u2014I can see why she wouldn\u2019t have gotten an invite for off work hours\u2014would she sit in the corner with the other teenage girls?

Everyone in your workplace could tell you avoid your supervisor and other coworkers. Instead of communicating with coworkers and or at least attempting to voice your issues, you made a fit.

Not everyone is your friend or needs to be. You avoid them and now are upset you were not invited? C'mon.", "YTA - why would you do that?  Those actions literally make no sense whatsoever.  You sound super bratty and self-centered.", "YTA. You actively avoid contact with these people, especially your supervisor, and you get pissy when they don't invite you to a social gathering?

You avoid the owners son, because you\u2019re not comfortable with males (this part is understandable, and not what makes you an AH) but then you can\u2019t get mad when the person you avoid avoids you back???", "Yes. You are an immature brat. Try to be better on the future.", "YTA what\u2019s wrong with you", "YTA.  You sabotaged the business.  You deserve to be fired.", "YTA\n\nYou are confusing your work life with your personal life. Co-workers were having a hang out; you needed to keep work keys secure and available for business.

You ruined an order and jeopardized the owners livelihood because you got jealous you were left out of a pizza party? A party organized by someone you don\u2019t talk to and don\u2019t feel comfortable going to? You\u2019re really immature and need to grow up a little.

That was very childish and probably cost the owners a significant amount of money. They would be within their rights to ask you/your parents for reimbursement.

Who were you punishing here except yourself? \nYTA \nThat's so weird.", "You actively chose not to have a relationship with their son and then got upset for not being invited to his get together. It is ok to distance yourself form people if you need to but it is unreasonable to expect them to not respond in kind.

In this case, the consequence of disliking men (and the owner\u2019s son in particular) is not being invited to hang out around them.\n\nIn response to the owner\u2019s son quite literally respecting the boundaries *you* set, you decided to punish your coworkers, the owner, and the business itself by throwing a temper tantrum.

Or even a wake at a funeral? Because, why? You felt hurt?\n\nIt just doesn't make sense to me. If you were my employee, I'd fire you in an instant.

Why was that your revenge of choice?\n\n\nYTA", "YTA. You really never got to the phase where you suddenly realize the people around you have lives and they don't revolve around you, did you? You throwing away the key wasn't just going to affect the son you were butthurt about. It affected the rest of the staff, the owners, the customers whose orders probably were either late or didn't get them at all. \n\nSo you ruined other people's events, lost your job a lot of money, and are surprised when you're the one that's in trouble? How do you think you get paid? The company needs to fulfill order for money. That money eventually goes to you on payday. You cut off their ability to make money, you don't have payday.

I understand you're still a child, but you need to grow up and realize that the world does not evolve around you.

I can\u2019t even\u2026.", "Lol you getting fired yta", "So why is your response to force his parents to rekey a door? You're petulant.", "Look you can be upset about that, but don\u2019t sabotage your job", "Yeah, this isn't kindergarten where the teacher forces kids to invite the whole class to their birthday parties. The business was closed, nobody was clocked in, so it's not \"a coworkers thing\". It was a friend's thing for coworkers who are also friends. You're not comfortable being friends with male coworkers? Fine. No problem. But don't turn around and expect them to treat you like a friend.", "No way; I hope they do give her a reference. \u201c she got pissed because she wasn\u2019t included in a hangout outside of work with someone she never talked to, so she threw out the only copy of a key we have and screwed us out of a chunk of income\u201d", "Useful, no definitely not but that in an of itself doesn\u2019t make OP an AH. Especially, if she has some unresolved trauma revolving around that.", "Yeah, to just throw that out there like this with no explanation is bizarre and doesn\u2019t help OP\u2019s case. It\u2019s not like having a fear of spiders.", "Relax.", "She\u2019s absolutely TA, but she is very young and hopefully she learns a lot from this in order to be a decent employee/human at her next job. Being black listed to all other local businesses would be too much. This experience and all of the replies here will likely help her mature in this aspect of her life real quick", "And the son (who\u2019s a supervisor aka someone with more power in the workplace) action to host the event AT WORK and leave out ONE employee created a hostile work environment. That\u2019s terrible leadership. If he wanted to leave just one person out - the event shouldn\u2019t have been hosted at work. A supervisor shouldn\u2019t be that petty, if he\u2019s bothered by how she\u2019s acting (it\u2019s ridiculous to not speak to your supervisor because they are male) he should have spoke to her about it. Not tried to bully her or isolate her by hosting an event at work and leaving her out. \n\nSo I\u2019d argue the son is doing damage to the business as well by creating a hostile work environment. And the parents probably realize that so maybe that\u2019s why they didn\u2019t fire her right away. \n\nNo one in this story sounds mature or like good employees. OP is the bigger asshole, but for this is more a ESH in my opinion.", "Frankly I'm surprised she hasn't already been fired.", "I don't see how they can they keep her around. Maybe next time she is angry, she does something to the food they prepare!", "Right? Like she makes a point of **not speaking** with ***her supervisor*** and then has the nerve to act shocked when said supervisor is like \"ok then\" and doesn't invite her to an off-work private thing he's hosting? It's complete \"I'm outraged my actions have consequences and the person I've been going out of my way to treat like shit didn't invite me to their party\" level foolishness. Jesus.", "10\\10", "This is what's wrong with today's society. They think everyone has to be included  or no one is allowed to do anything. It doesn't work that way.", ">You don\u2019t get invited to things just for existing.\n\nOHHHHH....\n\nSo you're saying I should stop being pissed that I want invited to each and every White House inaugural ball since I've been born????\n\nCrap.  I guess I'll try and undo a lot of the mischief I've been causing.", "betting OP received a lot of participation trophies growing up.", "That\u2019s really not entirely fair. When I was that age I was still extremely uncomfortable with men. Because I was a victim of CSA. Others are sometimes because they were sexually assaulted as an adult also and/or because of a background with abuse. There are very valid reasons that people can be uncomfortable with men sometimes and it\u2019s not fair to invalidate fear of males just because you do have to interact with them. And fyi, I don\u2019t hate men, and there\u2019s very little times where I\u2019m affected anymore and it\u2019s much more specific now when it does happen. But I\u2019ve also had a lot more time to deal and heal from trauma. There are absolutely valid reasons for being uncomfortable around men. That doesn\u2019t mean the rest of ops actions are okay, but hopefully this will be something she looks back on and realized that the key thing wasn\u2019t okay even if her feelings were hurt. And she really should face some sort of accountability. But there are valid reasons to be uncomfortable around men.", "I dunno, she\u2019d be an asshole if she avoided an entire group of people because of their skin color, why is their sex any different?", "She hasn\u2019t said that tho. She literally said she\u2019s not comfortable around him because he\u2019s male and avoids him. Why then? So unless she HAS a specific reason, her basis of fear is illogical and irrational. Most men are not going to randomly attack a woman.", "Judging a whole demographic whether it's based on experience or not is the definition of prejudice.\n\nIf someone had an unpleasant experience with a gay person and avoided all gay people as a result they'd still be an AH. It's no different when the target is all males.", "If a \"male\" had asked her to come hang out she would have probably called him a creep. No one is obligated to hang out with a person after work. She is uncomfortable around most of them, so why would they invite her?", "If this is a true story, it's probably that they're super kind people with a family business who wants to go easy on what sounds like a very anxious and immature teenager. \n\nBut really, I think they should give her more consequences because just getting upset doesn't fix anything. She needs to learn that you can't destroy property at work and keep your job.", "That's where giving everyone all these participation trophies has gotten us.", "Exactly! It\u2019s not.", "Fair. But she didn't just destroy property, she could have potentially cost them a lot of money since they had a large catering order and it doesn't say how long it took for them to get into the kitchen to be able to fill that order, if they were able to fill it at all. Although, considering she hasn't been fired, they likely were able to get in and fill it, because if it was a significant loss of income she'd definitely be fired.", "Both comments are too generic, not like everyone with participation trophies think like this.", "leaded gas enjoyer opinion", "No the issue is primary schools having stupid rules that you can\u2019t invite anyone from your class to a birthday party unless you invite the whole class. They grow up thinking that it\u2019s an all or nothing type of situation. Yeah it sucks that OP was left out but this is a situation of her own making. She isn\u2019t comfortable enough around him to even ask for help or advice at work(fair enough) but you can\u2019t expect him to want to hangout with you outside of work!", "And as much as she is trying to hurt her employer for something petty, whose event did she try to ruin?", ">leaded gas enjoyer opinion\n\nEnglish that was not", "It says in the post (last paragraph) that they had a big catering order to fill and other customers orders. They need to use the kitchen to fill those orders and she threw out the only key to the kitchen.", "And the funny thing is the person she's mad at isn't even the owner whose business it is, it's the son. So she took it out on the wrong person.", "Right, like, she didn't even care about the other people whose event she is ruining."]}
