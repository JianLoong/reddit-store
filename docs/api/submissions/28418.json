I am a bit more cautious these days being chronically immunocompromised. But that one-day thing and raw honey... it might literally kill me next week but there's nothing more YOLO than a cancer diagnosis. \ud83d\ude06", "Several kinds are, via contamination of other food or water.", "Snort laughed at this", "\ud83c\udfc5", "He could have just so happened to get a random stomach virus after eating pasta that was left out for a day? I mean, sure, coincidences happen, but it makes much more sense that the pasta gave him food poisoning.", "Fair, and guys are dicks to their friends. We just are. Whether we\u2019re saving their life or not.", "5 days old pasta\u2026. 8 days old pasta\u2026 at room temperature. I have stones for a stomach but even I would recoil from something like that.", "I\u2019ve got the \u2018dumb ways to die\u2019 song stuck in my head now.", "Wait, he just left in on the counter the whole time? Did I read that correctly?!", "I was hospitalized for two weeks and almost died...from food poisoning.", "Dude is auditioning for a Darwin Award!", "You can, it just needs to be refrigerated after you cook it.", "Logic fail. I feel guilty for laughing at this guy. But this gets funnier every time I read it.", "Especially if that pasta has meat chunks in it \ud83e\udd2e", "I think there's another one on his channel involving old pasta too. I don't fuck with old food anymore after finding his channel \ud83d\ude02", "Can the microwaves actually kill the bacteria? Do the microwaves themselves alter the proteins in them enough? Normally when people heat up leftovers they aren't getting the food up to the temperatures that would actually kill the bacteria, or for the length of time required to do so, so unless there's something about the actual microwaves themselves, the bacteria aren't going to die.", "lol.   \nThe funny thing is light actually does kill plenty of bacteria.   \nStill, I'd love for the colour blue to be an ultimate sanitizer.", "Oh, mood, I\u2019m going to be watching the pop-lids on jars like a hawk for the rest of my life. I\u2019d barely given them a second thought until now.", "My ex flatmate from the Ivory Coast would cook a pot of rice and leave it out on the counter in the pot for an entire week, just reheating the whole pot when she wanted to eat more rice. AND SHE WAS PREGNANT.", "Refrigeration is a modern miracle that saves money and lives. Like holy shit we already solved this problem stop dying to it.", "Or frozen.  Reheat in a covered container with some cooking fat and/or broth because it dries out; or use in casseroles or soups.", "It can be stored max 3 days before you should toss it.", "Agreed, if it\u2019s a day old, in a cold house, and  hasn\u2019t got any meat or anything in it AND it\u2019s covered over. I\u2019d eat it and have with no problems other than it being a weird texture but never something beyond a day. \n\nthat\u2019s asking for an unintentional gut cleanse", "dear god. Thank you for sticking it in my head now, too.", "Yes, you read that correctly. You can reheat pasta. But only if you stored it right. Like cold.", "Well obviously it\u2019s simplifying to say the microwave kill anything directly. But the microwaving process kills via heating the water throughout anything within the food. So yes it can kill the bacteria. Can obviously debate how it was heated but we have no idea how long the roommate microwaved the food. \n\nThe point is, if they\u2019re claiming they\u2019re going to cook it enough to kill the bacteria in the microwave and even if we give them the benefit of the doubt that they double nuked it, it COULD kill bacteria and still not be safe because the bacterial toxins don\u2019t break down from the same level of heating treatment.", "Jesus", "Her immune system must have been made of steel. That's *insane*.", "No, not a \"day old.\" Never.", "Exactly, I learned that as a freaking kid. We also had classes in school teaching us basic cooking skills, they def told us about bacteria and proper food storage.", "I'm not questioning the point about the toxins, just whether microwaves kill bacteria.", "Sometimes I'll forget I have one chicken nugget or something left and it's like 45 minutes later and I'm like \ud83d\ude2c maybe I shouldn't eat this (I always do)", "Microwaves (the appliance) do kill bacteria when used for enough time to heat the item to a proper temperature. Microwaves (the waves created by the appliance) do not directly kill bacteria, but they cause water molecules in an item to vibrate which in turn causes the heat that kills bacteria.", "Got it. I'm guessing the roommate (along with plenty of other people) thinks the waves created magically kill the bacteria. I'm also guessing the \"when used for enough time\" part of the heating equation is rarely achieved.", "Correct! It's a function of temperature and time too, the hotter the temp and the longer it's held there, the more bacteria will die."]}
