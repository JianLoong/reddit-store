Personally, I don\u2019t really want to hang out with people from work after work, we already spend a lot of time together. But I do understand that some people are more social than I am. I think it\u2019s totally fair to feel frustrated that he\u2019s gone all day and then hangs out with coworkers and THEN drives them all home while you\u2019re home alone. Especially with another child coming you probably need to put some boundaries in place. I also would have lost it that he didn\u2019t even consider you. That\u2019s the part for me that\u2019s a hard no. I don\u2019t give a s&(! about your friends if i\u2019m sitting here starving. Get your a** home now, they can take ubers.

So you don\u2019t completely lose your sanity.. Set aside some time for yourself where he\u2019s at home with the kids.", "NTA for this incident. He should have called the moment plans changed and been more attentive to the fact that you also need food. \n\nAs for the general animosity towards him hanging out with coworkers after work, please let him have that. I wish I had that. As it is, most my of coworkers can rot in Hell, and the rest I can only tolerate in work situations. I wish they were the kind of people I could get a drink with after work but they are so... anyways enough rant, just don't ruin a good thing he has going for him. \n\nAbsolutely give him the talking to he deserves for this incident and explain why it was such a big deal this time. Make sure he knows sometimes you need him to think of you and the family and how his choices impact y'all.", "NAH (except maybe your friend... who thinks \"eating with friends from work\" is somehow exclusive to men?)\n\nI think his reasonings are valid. I'd say at least the first month of going out of one's way to establish these social bonds at work is reasonable at a new job.\n\nHowever, it's clear his attention is split, things are falling through the cracks, and you have your hands full with 2.5 kids. You should make it clear while you understand there's an adjustment period, **this can not be an ongoing trend.** \n\nBut why don't you just have your bank second a secondary debit card for the account so you both have one?

But it is wildly irresponsible of you not to have financial back ups in place. You are about to have three children and if your husband takes your card you are just shit out of luck? I'm assuming that based on the fact the you are on your third kid you have had at least 3 years as an adult already to solve this very very solvable problem, (cash, credit cards, back up debit cards, temporary visa gift cards, checks, venmo, zelle, paypal, food delivery since first time orders usually get the fees waived and give free delivery... I mean the options are fucking limitless), so today's food issues are due to irresponsibility and poor planning on both of your part.", "Question...\nWas hubby driving or was someone else?

You have no food at home on a day that is grocery day and he is not at all thinking about your needs. No even going into the childcare part. Your friend is dumb, sorry. I'd expect your friend to be more understanding and support you but this is so off base.\n\nYou need to talk with both of them. It sounds like your husband has gotten used to ignoring home duties and takes you and your generosity for granted.

You were angry in the moment (hangry, actually, which is 10x worse while pregnant) which is totally understandable and doesn\u2019t make you TA.\n\nBut there is kind of a perfect storm of events here that I don\u2019t think your husband is TA for either. Two weeks is not that long to get the hang of a new workplace style, and it makes sense your social husband wants to build camaraderie and not be the guy always saying no. He needs to develop boundaries here. Maybe discuss him driving on his own 3 days per week and carpooling 2, or going out after work once a week, or whatever you both can agree on. \n\nAlso, him having your debit card is abnormal and he wouldn\u2019t necessarily project the consequences of that in the moment of being asked to join dinner. You gotta keep at least some emergency cash at hand going forward. And emergency snacks.\n\nLastly, did he know you were considering this a potential \u201cdate night\u201d? When I was pregnant I feel like my husband walked on eggshells around me and I had to all but write it on the wall when I was in the mood.\n\nA conversation about his work boundaries is absolutely necessary here very soon, and hopefully you can keep it forward-action focused rather than blaming him for how he has frustrated you already.", "NTA - I think your best friend is missing the point\u2026your husband is getting the opportunity to unwind while you do not.

One spouse always out with friends while the other spouse(usually the wife since they are the ones who mostly become housewives) never get to have a night out, always around kids and then never get to do anything fun with their husband because he goes out and has fun with friends or the mistress if their is one.\nMeanwhile the spouse who wants their spouse to give a damn is treated as being unreasonable and a fun killer.", "This guy is ALREADY a father.", "It's not about the debit card.

It was a real eye opener.", "His failure to prioritize your needs when pregnant is what I find disturbing. It seems he\u2019s unwilling to go to any extra trouble to bring food to the woman carrying his child. You have a problem. The unwinding with coworkers every night when he has a family is not normal in our culture. I don\u2019t find it plausible that they all do everything together so much. I find it troubling that he is leaving you alone pregnant with two small children. Sure, he\u2019s enjoying the hell out of his new lifestyle. That\u2019s not the point. He\u2019s being a cad. Can you afford a private detective? Just because his office is all men doesn\u2019t mean squat. Wherever they all go together, there are available females present. Plz look into it.", "When you say it like that it sounds really crappy. NTA!", "Oh yeah, right, I forgot. And we also unwind by being mothers to our grown \"strong\" male partners. Yeah.", "LOL, this is my bathroom. If I don't let her in, it's tears. If I let her in the bathroom, she wants to come in the shower!", "They may be nonsense to you but that doesn't mean it's nonsense to the person having the thought. \n\nAt no point have I defended this mans actions, I have only asked for his prospective which op gave, in this case his prospective was bullshit and he was absolutely being an AH, that was never in question. \n\nAlso do you feel better about yourself correcting someone who has dyslexia and struggles with spelling?   Auto correct only help so much.", "NTA. You should not have had to call him. He knew he had your card and he knew you needed to eat but he still went out with coworkers leaving you to wait until 6ish? There is no way! I understand you being livid! He left his pregnant wife at home hungry while he went out to eat with coworkers! You\u2019re being so much nicer about the situation than I would be.", "NTA. For his money situation have him carry cash. You feel the spending more if you use cash rather than card and he'll only have a certain amount so his time out with co workers will be more limited. Honestly though, this feels like something you would have to do for your teenager, not your husband. He needs to get his priorities in order.", "Heres the thing, you work during the day (kids are work) and he works during the day. He earns money, you save money (no daycare fees or nanny fees) therefore you both work say 8am to 5pm. Anything before 8am or after 5pm, and weekends, is shared 50/50. He wants two nights out for work with his colleagues for 4 hours? Sure, but you get four hours \u2018after work\u2019 in a week too, kid and spouse free. Seriously, I don\u2019t care if you park the car up somewhere and nap you need to put this in action for at least 3-6 months to get the routine happening. Then maybe you ease off, or maybe you don\u2019t. Alternative is find a new husband\u2026 potentially could use those 4 hours a week to do that lol but seriously, this isn\u2019t the 1950s! You both work hard at your jobs during the work week, but everything outside of 8-5 is \u2018shared time\u2019 to work on family life together. If he wants to be single then give him the option\u2026 it sounds like he already isn\u2019t that bothered about you or the baby, or the kids, after work hours\u2026 and yes, grown ass man can just get cash out from a bank each week like omg", "NTA but I recommend that you tell your husband this new job jas made you aware that you both need to change how the household is run. \n\nDivide up the week equitably. For example, if he works 5 days a week then one day of the weekend he's free to do whatever he wants, the other you are. Have specific evenings where it is his responsibility to come home and be in charge, whether that means you going out or just you being free to nap and flick through things on your phone. Write it down on paper together and negotiate until you both agree and then both sign it and stick to it. \n\nIf he argues that the two of you shouldn't need such a thing, tell him you agree but his actions have shown you thats not true.", "NTA your husband is a giant AH. He left you home alone, with no access to money or food on what was supposed to be your date night. Your only opportunity to go out with your husband without the kids. All while you\u2019re pregnant. What. An. A.H!", "The \"borrowing wife's debit card when there's no food at home\" thing is bullshit - both husband and OP are to blame because it's such a stupid situation to put yourself in. Either get food for the household first, go to an ATM and get cash for husband's lunch and leave the card at home, or get a credit card to use for emergencies.", "Off topic, but noone will starve after not eating for a day except maybe a very weak newborn. Also if you are really starving you will oc say yes if someone offers you to bring you food. If you have enough energy left to decline the food offer and waiting a few more hours to get your own food, you are maybe hungry, but not starving. We should really stop overdramatizising everything. \n\nEvery year thousands of ppl in third world countries die of starving. They don't die bc \"they haven't eaten a ful meal for 10 hours\", they starve bc they have to little to eat over weeks or months.", "Yes. In this regard, they are both the asshole for poor planning.", "OP, because I haven't seen this mentioned yet. Having only a single debit card is not sustainable for 2 people. What would happen if that got pinged for fraud or stolen or lost? I suggest you get some kind of emergency credit card just in case.\n\nAs for your husband, I don't think there's enough evidence for cheating, but it sounds like he's using any excuse not to be home.", "Honestly as a guy I love going to grocery stores with the boys lmao. We\u2019re in college so I\u2019m guessing it\u2019ll fade as I get older but we pop some\nedibles and go explore target or stop n shop and get some grub. Always a great time \ud83d\ude02", "100%", "Perspective\\*", "YTA. He has a new job. Part of that is going to be forming relationships with his coworkers. Its not going to kill you to wait an hour before you eat. You are just running off spite and anger and emotions vs realizing that the only thing he did wrong here was not to give you a call beforehand.", "NTA \n\nYou and the children should come first. He needs to fix his priorities. This has nothing to do with how guys unwind and everything to do with him being a selfish AH.", "Ah yes,memories. Shopping with toddlers. ARE YOU DOING A POO OR A WEE MUM??"]}
