I know it sounds a little nerdy but it\u2019s not like that, we\u2019re all just some girls who like to read and share our thoughts, especially on historical fiction. Well I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of those book balls on tiktok recently where people throw huge parties where everyone dresses up extravagantly in ball gowns and those intricate masks and parasols and whatnot and thought it looked super fun, only there weren\u2019t any being held anywhere near me so I decided to hold an intimate one with the girls from my book club. There are about a dozen of us and we\u2019ve met up multiple times so we\u2019re all good friends. One of these girls is a close friend of mine, I\u2019ll call her Sam (29F) and she does not like to dress up at all. She\u2019s always in sweats or athletic clothes, never does her makeup or hair, just doesn\u2019t really care about her appearance even for formal events, I remember she skipped our prom and wore jeans to our ceremony, which is fine, she\u2019s a beautiful girl. But I didn\u2019t want that at my ball, so I didn\u2019t invite her. I sent out beautiful invites that I spent a good chunk of money for, rented out a small hall that fit my budget, catered, and only asked my friends to pitch in about $20 each to cover some costs. Everyone bought beautiful extravagant gowns and accessories and I got even more excited. Well eventually word somehow made it to Sam and she asked me about the event. She asked if I was really hosting an event for the book club and not inviting her and after hesitating I said yes but only because I know she would never wear a ball gown or put effort into looking good. She said she was upset that I wouldn\u2019t want her there even if she wore her regular clothes and I told her that that\u2019s not fair, that I put in all of this effort for a beautiful event where everyone can be a little extra for one day and I didn\u2019t want her to ruin the aesthetic. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me since then and the ball was two days ago (a success btw- everyone looked amazing). Am I the a**hole for not inviting her because she would ruin the event?", "created_utc": 1690672344, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15d5tx6/aita_for_not_inviting_my_friend_to_my_party/", "score": 1860, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would have sent her an invite and said that the attire was mandatory that way she could have chosen whether or not she wanted to attend and if she didn't no loss to you. If you two are as good of friends as you say then you should have at least told her about it so she didn't hear it from anyone else and feel left out.", "There are two perspectives on what this party is, and they\u2019re not mutually exclusive but one is more important to you, and the other is to her:\n\n-  This party, like all, is a social function, and it\u2019s hurtful to get excluded from those if you\u2019re part of the regular group.\n\n-  This party is a ceremony of suspending reality for an evening and giving in to the illusion of living in a different period of time, even if it\u2019s just in garb and menu.\n\nTo suspend your disbelief, you need everyone to show up and fully commit.  Dungeons & Dragons is a great example:  You want your group of friends to get together to play D&D, but you want everyone to actually be *into it* and fully participate in order to have fun and carry the game along.  If one person at the table isn\u2019t paying attention, or is blas\u00e9 about the storyline, or doesn\u2019t work on their character, it\u2019s going to effectively drag the whole vibe down.  Participation from everyone is the only way to keep the illusion alive.  (And to be honest, it\u2019s me who doesn\u2019t play D&D with my friends because it\u2019s not my thing.)\n\nHowever, you did not give her *the chance* to participate.  You could have brought it up and explained the importance of committing to the theme and dressing up, and offering to help her choose what to wear and trying to convince her that it could actually be a lot of fun, but instead you excluded her based on the assumption that she wouldn\u2019t try, and that\u2019s actually pretty hurtful.  I understand where you\u2019re coming from, but you did not act like a friend towards her in this situation.  YTA\n\nEdit for better grammar", "Yta. You could have invited her and made it clear that the dress code is not optional.  Then it's up to her if she wants to dress up and go or stay home, but you didn't even give her the option.", "YTA, should've just send invitations where it specifies that it requires formal attire so she could at least choose.", "YTA People are not an \"aesthetic\". They are not flowers, or napkins or tablecloths. Your friends and may not have wanted to wear a fancy dress costume but she is a member of the book club and most decidedly not an \"aesthetic\". You chose some silly video you saw on TikTok over friendship and the you're \"aesthetics\" which is sad", "YTA. Imagine not being invited to your friend\u2019s party bc she doesn\u2019t like your style\u2026", "YTA. You excluded a friend of more than ten years because you were afraid she\u2019d \u201cruin the aesthetic\u201d of your party. You didn\u2019t even give her the opportunity to choose to dress up or decline the invitation. That\u2019s insulting.\n\nEdited to add: I can\u2019t imagine wanting to be friends with someone who is so concerned about appearances. Even your choice of title is cringeworthy.", "YTA. you made an assumption (which may be correct but might not be) that she would not go in party attire. Even people who enjoy the comfort dressing 24/7, now and then, like an actual REASON to dress up - like a costume party. \n\nYou should have invited her and the invitations can indicate: dress code / theme dressing required!", "YTA guess you are only a fair weather friend.  A real close friend would not care about the aesthetic but would want her good friend from school to come and enjoy herself with other friends.  You screwed her over and are now trying to justify your despicable behavior.  You owe her such a huge apology if she will actually listen to you.  You need to grovel and beg her forgiveness for the way you treated her.  And what happens when she tells the others in your group about not being invited because of her look.  She might have surprised you and gotten dressed up, especially if you talked with her beforehand and maybe tried to help her.  That's what a true friend would do.\n\nETA I noticed that on your profile it says \"love, love, love\".  Where was that love when intentionally excluded her.  Maybe you should change it to hate, hate, hate.", "YTA.\n\nThe obvious solution is to invite her and then state on the invitation that it is a rigid dress code. Then if she chooses to come in sweatpants you're justified in turning her away.", "YTA\n\nYou should've invited her, but explained the importance dress code. You could ask her for a day and if she said no then you could rescind the invite. \n\nNot inviting her and giving the option was wrong.", "YTA.

Let her bow out or step up.", "YTA\n\nI understand your thought and reasoning. Its logical. The dress might not have fit the event and you are putting time and effort into it. However, being an asshole in this scenario means lacking empathy. She is your close friend you said, she loves spending time with you and participating in the club clearly. Your effort is not wasted by allowing a person you love come to hang out and still participate having a blast. Do you really think a dress is going to ruin a good time with friends?", "ESH\n\nYou should have at least given her a choice and opportunity to dress up by inviting her, and she needs to understand dress codes.\n\nIt might have been a Y T A had it not been for her reply of: \u201cwas upset that I wouldn\u2019t want her there even if she wore her regular clothes.\u201d\n\nPeople can cry \u201cpEopLe aRen\u2019T aEsTheTiCs\u201d all they want, but if y\u2019all are paying for and creating a whole event dedicated to dressing up, she needs to understand she can\u2019t show up in a jeans and t-shirt. It\u2019s not appropriate and it\u2019s disrespectful. Don\u2019t want to follow the event-themed dress code?

Seems pretty easy to invite her while explaining the dress code and that even though it\u2019s out of her normal comfort level, it is expected of all guests. Then she has the choice", "YTA.\n\nHopefully Sam rethinks your friendship because she needs to. \n\nIf you really wanted a dress code, you could've invited her and told her that (as others have stated in the comments). But to just not invite her when you invited everyone else is just cruel.", "YTA. Why not give her a chance to try and dress up? Your could require the costume and she could turn down the invite if she didn't want to fancy up. \nIt's super mean to exclude one person who isn't harmful.", "People aren\u2019t accessories. \n\nYTA for putting a look over someone you\u2019re \u201cclose\u201d to and then trying to hide it from her. So you\u2019re an AH and a coward, you didn\u2019t even have the spine to have a conversation with her ahead of time, you hid your head in the sand and hoped word wouldn\u2019t get back to her.", "YTA. You could have invited her and made it clear following the dress code was mandatory. Then it would have been her choice. I suspect she is upset about being so blatantly excluded.", "YTA.  You invite everyone but tell them that people will not be admitted if they don't follow the dress code.  Then it's up to her.  It's not dissimilar to having a wedding or any event with a dress code.", "You didn't invite her because she \"would ruin the aesthetic.\"  When I hear the word \"aesthetic,\" I think room decor.  Yah, you're shallow and that was cruel to purposefully exclude her as the only bookclub member not invited, and then just to top it off, you insult her to her face by telling her she doesn't look good.  Like what?  I'm just awed sometimes by how people casually admit to being straight up cruel and then come on here with a shocked Pikachu face. Like yes, YTA.", "YTA imagine if your close friend did this to you? Invite all your friends and excluded you, didn\u2019t bother to tell you and when confronted said \u201csorry you\u2019d just ruin the vibe\u201d. You\u2019re a terrible friend and a coward.

Congrats you\u2019ve thrown away a friendship over a TikTok trend. \u201cDon\u2019t want my friends to see this\u201d? Do they know you excluded her or are you too cowardly to tell them the real reasons Sam isn\u2019t going?", "YTA.\n\nSome events have dress codes. Every adult knows that, including Sam.

Maybe she would have made an exception just this once!\n\nYTA for deliberately excluding her without telling her in advance. You could have invited her and made it clear on the invitation what the mandatory dress code was. You didn't bother to do that, and in doing so, you denied her the option to participate. That was not a kind thing to do.", "YTA, you could have put formal ball attire required as a dress code.  She could have declined. You excluded her instead and tried to be sneaky about it.  You\u2019re not a very good friend.", "YTA.

Should have at least given her a chance to dress up.", "YTA a choice could have been given to her but to outright now invite someone who is your suppose friend and not just a book club member is shallow and makes you a terrible friend.

I know it sounds a little nerdy but it\u2019s not like that, we\u2019re all just some girls who like to read and share our thoughts, especially on historical fiction. Well I\u2019ve been seeing a lot of those book balls on tiktok recently where people throw huge parties where everyone dresses up extravagantly in ball gowns and those intricate masks and parasols and whatnot and thought it looked super fun, only there weren\u2019t any being held anywhere near me so I decided to hold an intimate one with the girls from my book club. There are about a dozen of us and we\u2019ve met up multiple times so we\u2019re all good friends. One of these girls is a close friend of mine, I\u2019ll call her Sam (29F) and she does not like to dress up at all. She\u2019s always in sweats or athletic clothes, never does her makeup or hair, just doesn\u2019t really care about her appearance even for formal events, I remember she skipped our prom and wore jeans to our ceremony, which is fine, she\u2019s a beautiful girl. But I didn\u2019t want that at my ball, so I didn\u2019t invite her. I sent out beautiful invites that I spent a good chunk of money for, rented out a small hall that fit my budget, catered, and only asked my friends to pitch in about $20 each to cover some costs. Everyone bought beautiful extravagant gowns and accessories and I got even more excited. Well eventually word somehow made it to Sam and she asked me about the event. She asked if I was really hosting an event for the book club and not inviting her and after hesitating I said yes but only because I know she would never wear a ball gown or put effort into looking good. She said she was upset that I wouldn\u2019t want her there even if she wore her regular clothes and I told her that that\u2019s not fair, that I put in all of this effort for a beautiful event where everyone can be a little extra for one day and I didn\u2019t want her to ruin the aesthetic. She hasn\u2019t spoken to me since then and the ball was two days ago (a success btw- everyone looked amazing). Am I the a**hole for not inviting her because she would ruin the event?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "I see and understand the comments saying, \"people are not an aesthetic,\" and I agree, but if this party was described as a costume ball with a certain theme then wouldn't it be inappropriate to show up not even trying to follow the theme?  I think she should have invited the friend and included in the invite the dress code, perhaps a reason why the dress code was important.   Then the friend could have either accepted the conditions (given to all equally) and come or declined.", "\"I'm sorry I didn't invite you, I know you don't like dressing up and I didn't think you would be interested. I should have confirmed that with you first.\"", "ESH. You're rude for not inviting her to a group gathering based on aesthetics. She's rude for admitting she would ignore the dress code of a formal event.", "NTA, but I wouldn't have let her hear from someone else that she wasn't invited. Honesty is key in friendship (actually in everything), even if the other person doesn't respond nicely. She seems like and AH for being upset that you wouldn't accept her showing up like she was picking up a gallon of milk at the mart on the corner.", "NTA I\u2019m not inviting someone to an event if I know they\u2019re not going to take the event seriously. You aren\u2019t getting a seat at my D&D table if I know you won\u2019t spend the time outside the table making a character and getting invested. If my friend Dan gets invited and never dresses up, roleplays, or learns the game, why would I invite them to my medieval themed dinner?\n\nThat being said, I would\u2019ve probably already had this conversation in person with them before not inviting them. \u201cHey, I\u2019m holding a thing where this attire is mandatory. I know you hate that. Are you gonna dress up and take it seriously if I do extend an invitation? If no, then I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll have to sit this one out. Again, if you say yes and show up not in dress, you will not be invited in. I\u2019m being serious\u201d", "I\u2019m going with ESH. You SHOULD have invited her and let her know that the dress code was mandatory and let her choose to participate or not, that is absolutely fine. It is absolutely fine for you to throw a party with a specific aesthetic, and it\u2019s OK for people to choose not to participate.\n\nOn the other hand, she has decided to be bullheaded (and arguably maybe even a little self-centered) about formal events. If she\u2019d shown a history of being a good sport about these kind of events then this wouldn\u2019t have been an issue at all.\n\nEdit: I also think your title should actually be along the lines of \u201cAITAH for not inviting my friend to my formal dress up party because she never wants to dress up?\u201d", "\". . . **a close friend** of mine, I\u2019ll call her Sam (29F)  . . . does not like to dress up at all. . . so she would ruin the aesthetic.\"\n\nSo relieved your party was aesthetically on point and wasn't ruined by your *close friend* Sam. /s\n\nThe fact you lost a close friend because of your shallow ideals and behavior is irrelevant when upholding superficial appearances. Did the other attendees to your exclusive little petty party notice Sam's absence? Are these women aware of the reason for Sam's exclusion? \n\n**YTA.** Good friends are rare and hard to find - you proved that point completely and absolutely. Was it really worth losing Sam, a woman you describe as a close friend for something so superficial? Perhaps the next book you read should be one on finding your moral compass.", "NTA. Girl would\u2019ve showed up dressing normal anyway even if you sent a letter saying \u201cdress up is mandatory\u201d", "NAH you are allowed to have events with only people who enjoy the same type of activity. \n\nShe has demonstrated that she does not want to adapt her attire to the occasion. \n\nNeither of you seem like AHs to me. I can understand why her feelings are hurt, but she doesn\u2019t really seem to understand the impact of her decisions on others.", "I feel like people in the comments are ignoring the fact that this was essentially a costume party, and the only reason you even had the party in the first place was because you wanted to have a costume party?\n\nI think ESH. You should have invited her, but made it clear that costumes were mandatory. Her getting mad at the requirement is selfish and unfair. That\u2019s like wanting to go see a horror movie with your friends, and your one friend that hates horror movies wants to tag along and go on her phone the entire time. It takes everyone out of the experience and there\u2019s no point in her being there if she doesn\u2019t want to participate.", "I'mma say NTA cuz I've dealt with people like this before and there is no nice way to tell them to either participate in the theme or just don't show up. It's ok to have a theme and expect it to be followed especially by a friend. I think it's selfish of her to ignore the appropriate attire and just always dress down. There's a time and place for everything, including sweats and jeans, and this party isn't it. Yes, you should have given her a chance to comply but there is no nice way to say dress up or don't come no matter what anyone here says. Honestly I was ready to put y t a just from the title cuz that's some bullshit, but my daughter threw a theme party for her 18th and we were clear that everyone needed to follow the dress code and the couple of people that didn't follow it really did ruin the pictures and the overall feel of the party. I think it was disrespectful of them to just decide that what they wanted was more important than what we clearly requested for attendance. I think you should have pulled your friend aside in person and explained clearly as nicely as you could that she either had to dress up or not come, but I don't think that would have ended any better than this.", "ESH. As others said, you should\u2019ve asked her too and mentioned that the party had a dress code that was mandatory.\n\nOthers that have said Y T A fail to see that your friend said you didn\u2019t want her there even if she wore her regular clothes. She had zero intentions on dressing up. I\u2019m sorry, but if a friend has a party or ball with a specific dress code I either make sure to wear something fitting, or decline the invitation.", "NTA. If you invite a chronically late person to a surprise party, you\u2019re asking for it to be ruined. Same thing. You know your friends and have a good idea of how they\u2019ll react and behave. The fact that Sam responded by admitting she would have ignored the dress code and come anyway confirms your intuition. \n\nFor anyone saying that she wasn\u2019t \u2018given the chance\u2019 to either decline the invitation because it meant a dress code, or choose to dress up, she was going to do neither. She was going to show up to an elaborate costume party in sweats and OP knew it.  It\u2019s like wearing white to a wedding: knowing it\u2019s rude and going to draw attention to you, but not caring.  Better to just avoid the possibility.", "NTA -  dress code is a dress code. You just worded this terribly! \u201cWouldn\u2019t fit your aesthetic???\u201d", "NTA. You don\u2019t want weeds in you flower patch", "NTA as is bad manners to not dress up as a dress up event however you went about the wrong way, the way around this was to send invite detailing strict dress code and let her decline. You made yourself look bad", "These people do not understand, as a fellow book lover (who knows what you're talking about) NTA. \nLet me explain for those who di not understand, this isn't just about attire, it is about experience, these people want to immerse themselves in the characters, they want to feel as if they were in those books they read, it is part of the magic, just like when you go to disney everyone is in costumes, having someone coming in sweats would not only be a distraction and a spell breaker but also a huge act of disrespect on itself when all these people have spent ton of time preparing for this event.", "Honestly NTA. Trying to plan social events around someone who refuses to dress appropriately for the occasion is hugely stressful and also ruins the mood for everyone who did dress up.", "YTA. She's supposedly a friend. Everyone else in the club was invited, so she was bound to find out. All you had to do was make the attire mandatory for attending, putting the onus on her dressing up and going or not, and staying home.", "YTA. You excluded one person from your entire book club. How did you think that would go over? If ONE person not dressed up would \u201cruin\u201d your event you are pretty shallow. If she just didn\u2019t have the income to buy the dress would you still have excluded her?", "Yta & a horrible, judging, friend!", "YTA for charging people to go to your party. That's tacky.", "YTA\n\nNot inviting her was you deciding to exclude her explicitly.\n\nIf the wardrobe aesthetics are so essential, just list the attire as mandatory for entry and let her self-select out if she doesn't want to wear it.\n\nShe MIGHT have surprised you, if you hadn't written her off as a lost cause. May your mascara smudge and concealer crack the next time you exclude a 'friend' over instagram-able aesthetics.", "YTA it's fine to have a dress code but kinda shitty to exclude someone completely. Even though she probably made it clear that she wouldn't want to wear the dress and such having her know she was included and just declining the invite would have been best. \n\nIf all your friends were doing something you wouldn't want to do wouldn't you have liked the option to decline yourself? Or would you be ok with them basically saying \"we didn't want you there\"", "I'm not sorry... I didn't read your post because PARAGRAPHS ARE A THING.\n\nYou read books... I wonder if they utilize paragraphs...\n\nYea, yea downvote... IDGAF.", "I don\u2019t get why you didn\u2019t just\u2026 talk to her before inviting her. Explain the dress code and that it\u2019s mandatory, and that you love her but the event is important to you and so is the suspension of disbelief. That if it isn\u2019t her cup of tea you understand and would love to get together another time. This seems like a LOT of drama where there doesn\u2019t need to be. To be honest, I thought this was about teenagers before I re-read and saw the ages. Just communicate, you\u2019re 29. For that reason YTA.", "YTA but since this is a group of friends, why don't you ask them about excluding Sam, cause sounds like they didn't know she wasn't invited so that's secret you kept from them. See how well that works out, telling them you excluding your \"close friend\". \n\nMaybe next time, it'll be one of them excluded, but they should exclude you next time because you'll  exclude a your words \"Close friend\", they'll probably next on the chopping block if they dont \"fit\" your fantasy.\n\nBook Club is going to be \"fun\" right? You creating this schism with a \"close friend\" and keeping it secret from the rest of the book club, that's going to go over well.", "YTA, and please see a physician for that shoulder pain from patting yourself on the back for your success. Good luck keeping that book club together if you're going to start charging for your events.\"", "YTA, incidentally I am someone who never wore make-up or dressy stuff as a teenager or did my hair, when I was asked what I was wearing for most parties I answered 'clothes', and if pressed 'jeans and a tee shirt'. And I dressed the fuck up for every one of my best friend's costume parties because I LOVE costuming it up. You can't assume.  \n\n\nAlso said friend always put on invites that costumes were mandatory, as others have said, and turned people away at the door who'd ignored that. You don't have to exclude people like you did. I feel like you don't really care about her as a friend to do this - if I'm wrong and you do, apologise to her and show by your actions that you do, because right now I imagine she feels the same way as I do about it.", "NTA based on sam's response acting like she actually totally would've worn casual even with the formal specification if invited", "The thing about late 20's early 30's, is friendships shift, and you've just shifted this friend far far away from your self.\n\nYTA.", "You chose vanity over friendship.", "YTA\n\n\u201cIt sounds a little nerdy but it\u2019s not like that\u201d\n\nHuh?

Because she doesn\u2019t dress like you or wear makeup? Make up is overrated. Not everyone needs it. (Yes, I don\u2019t wear makeup aside from the occasional eyeliner and mascara.) I hate foundation. It makes my skin feel gross. Even so called \u201cquality\u201d make up. I\u2019d rather have a really good skin care routine.", "I love this response. My family went to a horror maze around Halloween and I am terrified of zombies and it was one of the main themes. I did not get an invite. Was I upset? No, because I knew I wouldn\u2019t have enjoyed myself and would have ruined it for everyone else. If you\u2019re not going to actively participate and ruin the immersion for others and they know you well enough to know that would happen then don\u2019t expect that invite, and don\u2019t get mad that they know you enough to know you won\u2019t participate.", "Literally nothing in this story is \"mean girl\" behavior, you idiots need reading comprehensive STAT. It's a dress up party, dressing up in FANTASY BALL GOWN attire is the ONLY point of the party, the dressing up IS the event, it's not a normal get together where attire isn't a big deal.", "first chapter, last chapter, google/Goodreads reviews. That leaves more time to work on the \"aesthetic\" of a cool tiktok book club.", "I read it as, she skipped prom completely and wore jeans to graduation. Maybe I read that wrong?", "Exactly!", "Chill out. Her friend literally admitted that she would have not dressed up. Like why are you foaming at the mouth to bully someone you don\u2019t even know. Go outside ffs.", "Exactly. You were given a choice to attend & declined. Sam didn't go to prom, probably because she didn't want to dress up, so who's to say she would've gone to the book club ball in the first place? But not letting her know about it was an AH move.", "I love a dope party, and I\u2019d be pretty hurt and take it personally if someone just showed up leisure ware.  Parties are a lot of work, and following the dress code on the invitation is a baseline acknowledgment of the work that goes in to pull one off.", "The reason why I gave OP the y t a is because she didn\u2019t give Sam the chance to act appropriately.  Sam maybe would have changed her tune, but we\u2019ll never know.\n\nGoing to Prom in jeans is one thing, but deliberately breaking dress code after your friend makes it clear that doing so would also break her heart, the AH judgement would transfer over to Sam.  It *would take some courage* to invite Sam knowing she likely wouldn\u2019t follow through on the directions on the invitation, but OP accepted the risk of excluding her and has come out as TA in my eyes.\n\nWe do kinda all know that Sam would just show up in jeans though, but it still hurts to be excluded on purpose.", "You should comb your hair every time you\u2019re going to be out in public lmao", "I kinda hope Sam shows up to the next book club meeting in the most intricate period ballgown with complete hair and makeup lol", "No matter how certain OP was that her \"close friend\" was going to refuse to follow the dress code, the part that makes her the definitely the AH is that she didn't even care enough about her feelings to tell her that she wasn't invited. I snorted when I saw this bit:\n\n>eventually word ***somehow*** made it to Sam \\[emphasis mine\\]\n\nLike, did OP seriously think none of the people she invited would mention it to her \"close friend\" that was normally a part of their group?", "I agree. It sounds like the event was a little bit like a suspension of reality and a step into fantasy and Sam would come and ruin it for everyone. I think OP using the word aesthetic is biasing people", "Idk, OP might do that\u2026", "I mean, I don\u2019t disagree but isn\u2019t age and physical features a lot different than not wanting to get dressed up?", "\n\n>but instead because they wanted to have a themed night and knew she would not be willing to match the theme.\n\nshe didn't even bother to ask. at least give them the option.", "She wasn\u2019t even given the CHANCE", ">But having a conversation about it would have fixed that\n\nI think OP knows that this isn't true.", "No she didn't. Words she said when she was upset are very different to \"well, I wouldn't have dressed up and would have just expected you to let me in.\"\n\nIt would have been easy to have a conversation with her and establish that a) dressing up was mandatory for everyone and if you didn't dress up you wouldn't be let in and b) there were alternatives for dressing up that didn't involve a ballgown.\n\nHad she accepted the invitation, not dressed up and then been mad she wasn't let in she'd be the AH, but she's not an AH because she didn't do that because she wasn't invited.", "I also like how when she says her book ball was successful, it's because everyone looked amazing. Did they actually enjoy themselves? Who knows, who cares, they looked great!", "And she had to note how fabulous the party went.", "Going to have to disagree with you here. This was a fairly close group of book club friends who hung out and talked about historical fiction. On a whim OP saw a tiktok trend and decided to get the book club group together to do something completely different, while secretly excluding one person who she claimed was a \"close\" friend. Nothing stopped her from saying \"hey I think it would be cool to have a tiktok ball where everyone dresses up in ballgowns. It's going to be mandatory formal. I'd love you to be there, but I know dressing up is not everyone's thing. I still wanted to include you.

Pretty much knew OP was the AH when she wrote (a success btw- everyone looked amazing) as if that actually mattered.", "Right, I think this is a situation where OP absolutely knows how this would have gone if an invite was given. Sam will demand to know why she can't show up out of dress code and/or do so anyway, and the people in the comments demanding Sam be \\*given a chance\\* don't understand that.\n\nNot to mention OP would be the asshole to a lot of this sub simply for wanting a party like this in the first place.", "You need to give people the opportunity to say yes or no instead of just assuming the answer. I\u2019ve had friends that I\u2019ve known for 20+ years surprise me by accepting an invite to something they had previously not been interested in. Even my wife, who isn\u2019t really in to football, will sometimes accept an invitation to come watch a game with me at a buddies house or even at the stadium. 99% of the time she declines, but I still ask because it\u2019s should be her choice to say no and not have me assume it for her. Maybe she just doesn\u2019t care what we are doing, she just wants to spend time with me.", "Did you even read the top comment in this thread???\n\nIt's not about whether or not OP's friend would dress up. Her desire (or lack of) to dress up is entirely irrelevant.\n\nThe point is, *OP didn't give her the choice*. OP took away that choice and deliberately excluded her friend while inviting all their other mutual friends.

Like, if we're having a Barbie party, then PINK. EVERYWHERE PINK lol\n\nBut the thing is, everyone in the club should have been invited. Sometimes, just getting an invitation is enough to make someone feel like they're involved even if they don't go. That's the only reason why I see OP is the AH.\n\nI get what OP was trying to do. I really do, but I can understand the friend's hurt as well, to a degree.\n\nShe could have straight up talked to the friend and made it adamantly clear that there was a strict dress code that everyone would follow. No exceptions. If friend decided to ignore it, she would have been the clear AH for not following basic party etiquette, which is FOLLOW DRESS CODE. OP and others would have been in the right to refuse her entry. Its done at weddings, birthday parties, and such. It can definitely be done here.", "I skipped prom & am pretty tomboyish but I would\u2019ve asked someone to help me or pay someone to help me doll up for a themed party. Heck I paid someone to do my hair & makeup for my pinning ceremony.", "That might have been because OP was attacking her normal style so it\u2019s the defensive response. OP sure puts a lot of value on makeup and clothes if she thinks not following her standard means you don\u2019t put effort into yourself lol", "Sounds 99% likely, as friends defense was \"you're excluding me for my clothes\" and not \"of course I'd dress up!\"", "I agree! I had a similar issue with friend years ago. A few of us got together Tuesdays at a local pub and over time the we grew to include friends of friends and even just pub regulars and we became a solid group of about 12. Every couple of months someone would throw a game night (think old school back when that exclusively meant board games / card games\u2026) and one woman didn\u2019t like to play games. Didn\u2019t pay attention, never knew if it was her turn, couldn\u2019t care less if she or her team lost etc. She always came though \u201cjust to hang out with the group\u201d. I\u2019ll be honest, everyone hated it. Not one single other person was there just to sit around and talk - we literally did exactly that every Tuesday.  We went to game night to play games! And we played competitive games because we liked to compete.  She threw the whole vibe. \n\nJust like OP. They have book club and other events with Sam - she doesn\u2019t need to come to a fancy dress party and wear regular clothes.", "So send an invite with a mandatory dress code? Don't not invite her and then let her find out she wasn't invited through the grapevine.", "This is the main point of defense OP has. If someone showed up to a black tie wedding in yoga pants and a crop top, they wouldn't be allowed in. It's perfectly reasonable to expect a dress code in certain situations. \n\nWhere OP went wrong was hoping that the event would go smoothly without the friend finding out. Instead of trying to do it behind their back, OP could've invited the friend. They could've simply said that the dress code was mandatory. Sure, the friend may have shown up and caused a scene. But, that would've been on them, not OP.", "Right? The idea they just won't tell her and hope she doesn't find out about this big event they're all planning is almost cartoonish. Did they really expect that to stay secret? The chatter leading up. The night of. No one was going to post photos on their socials? It was just going to not be talked about at the book group ever again?", "your definitely reaching at the last part. her friend didn\u2019t even attend prom cause she didn\u2019t wanna follow the dress code so i highly doubt she follow it for this event, and because they are friends she\u2019d probably think she shouldn\u2019t have to follow dress code", "I think they're just mad they aren't invited lol", "Well, here it's also because OP said she got the idea from tiktok, and it's not a huge leap to assuming she was planning to contribute this to the tiktok trend.\n\nI guess I agree with ESH, although I think OP is more of an asshole.  If you're actually good friends with someone, you invite them, while also making clear what kind of event it is and what the expectations are. It's a costume party, and everyone has to wear a costume.  She could have talked to Sam, and said, hey, I know you're not into dressing up -- so if you don't want to come to this because it's a costume event, that's okay.\n\nIt sounds like OP didn't invite Sam because she didn't want to have a fight with Sam over whether Sam could come without adhering to the costume part.  Well, guess what -- there was no way Sam wasn't going to find out about the event, so OP got to have a fight with Sam anyway.  \n\nAt least if the fight had been over OP wanting to throw a costume party, and Sam wanting to come but not do the costume thing, then OP would have been in the right to exclude Sam for not agreeing to the event's rules.  \n\nThey're just different types of asshole, is all.  \n\nOP is the kind of asshole who doesn't want to be firm with a friend, so she's just a coward.  (It's cowardly to not invite ONE person from a group, and then act surprised when the person inevitably finds out about the event.)\n\nSam is the kind of asshole who seems not to care about her friends' request that she do something out of the ordinary for her, or that she put in effort she doesn't normally make.  At least, potentially -- her response \\*seems\\* to indicate that. But neither OP nor Sam will ever really know if Sam could have been convinced to dress up in a costume, which might feel different to her than having to dress up in a \"real world\" way, like for a prom.", "IF Sam is like that, then yes, this becomes an E-S-H or even N-T-A.  But Sam didn't wear jeans to prom; she skipped prom.  And it's been a while since prom.  If Sam is defying dress codes left and right still, OP should've said so.", ">The whole purpose of the event is to dress up,\n\nThis is where the votes are coming from, these are people who don't believe they should ever have to conform to a friend's wish. Notice how many people are reaming OP for caring about appearances this one time.", "> It's about consideration and giving your \"friend\" option to decline. \n\nExcept she already stated that she would've shown up and not followed the dress code. Thus making it awkward and possibly ruin the party by OP having friend thrown out and making a scene on the way out or let friend stay and make it awkward for allowing someone to stay that didn't respect the dress code.", "The difference is that you don't expecto be included in spite of. The friend does but under her own terms. She can't have it both ways. If you are not willing to make an extra effort sometimes, situations like this will happen", "> It's not like that.\n\n*Goes on to say what it is*\n\nMe: Oh, that's exactly what it is, and what I thought it would be.", "Wait until she finds out you can read nerdy books (whatever those are) AND understand how to apply makeup. \n\nSeriously, though, OP. YTA. This is myopic. You\u2019ve put appearance ahead of your friend. You\u2019re even worried about appearing like a nerd to a bunch of strangers on Reddit. It\u2019s okay that your friend doesn\u2019t put effort into her appearance only because she\u2019s already beautiful. Beauty standards change. Looks change. Youth fades. Your character, though. That you can control.", "Except the friend confirm what OP feared. She expected OP to include her in her normal wearing. She never said, I would have adhere to the theme. She felt hurt because she wasn't included despite not being willing to dress up for once wearing something not that comfortable for her.", "I don't see anything about a wedding, just a \"ceremony\" which could be anything unless I'm missing one of OPs comments. Either way, if she wore jeans to one event that does not have a strict dress code, that doesn't mean she'll refuse to dress up for other events that do have a dress code. I just don't see any reason to intentionally exclude somebody. If the real reason she's being excluded is because of the dress code, why not invite her and say you won't be allowed in unless you dress up?", "a lot of people in this thread seem to think it's fine showing up to this ball in sweats.", "Yeah. Lots of \u201cpeople are not aesthetics\u201d comments.

Can\u2019t show up to them in sweatpants. Places and events have dress codes! Nothing wrong with that.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that hard though.

Two adults having a mature conversation just like they do in them there books...", "Also, she could wear a suit of some kind and still fit the \u201caesthetic\u201d if she didn\u2019t want to wear a dress.", "I don\u2019t disagree that OP is TA here, but even if OP had done what you suggest - the friend would still be mad and OP would be making a post asking AITAH for telling my friend she can\u2019t come to my party if she doesn\u2019t dress up?", "THIS. Sam may have chosen not to attend (as someone who\u2019s deeply miserable when dressed up in costumes, this would be my choice). Sam may have gone the old-fashioned suit route, which wouldn\u2019t have ruined the aesthetic. Sam may even have decided to leap out of her comfort zone and worn an elaborate gown - OP has no idea what\u2019s in Sam\u2019s head or if this is something she may be interested in trying out for a change. But Sam didn\u2019t get to make any of those choices because OP dismissed her presence as unnecessary and her feelings as irrelevant.", "Not to mention she goes as far to say that because Sam wears sweats and athletic clothes, doesn't wear make up and doesn't do her hair up, that she doesn't care about her appearance which I find a stupid assumption to make in the first place. Some friend OP is... This shit boils me just because I personally don't wear makeup or do my hair up all the time and I also wear sweats (granted I'm also pregnant right now), but that sure as shit doesn't mean I don't care about my appearance. It's a fucked up assumption to make about anybody, some people just like to be natural and there's nothing wrong with that!", "Literally this.  For me, it\u2019s mostly about the people I\u2019m with, and how much I care about the event.  I would have skipped my prom too if my parents hadn\u2019t made me go, because I didn\u2019t care about 95% of the people in my grade, and I didn\u2019t like school dances.  But going out to do something pertaining to my interests, with just my friend group, is a lot more appealing.", "The thing is OP is still the asshole for not having the convo with Sam, IMO.\n\nShould have reached out and said \"look I'm throwing this thing. It's costume mandatory. I don't want to leave you out, I really care about you, but I really care about this too. I know it's not your thing, so I'm not expecting you to come, but\" etc etc.\n\nNot even trying is an asshole move.", "Of course she\u2019s mad she didn\u2019t get invited!

It would\u2019ve been easy for OP to give her \u201cfriend\u201d the option, but she went all Mean Girl instead.   \n\n\nEasy YTA.", "I think you are correct. The friend asked OP \u201cwouldn\u2019t you want me there even if I was dressed in regular clothes\u201d. \nNo, OP did not want her there in regular clothes. \n\nSome people like to go all out and get fancy sometimes, and the majority of this club wanted to do a BALL GOWN event, and OP REALLY wanted to do it, so much so that she did all the planning and funded the majority of it. \nIt\u2019s her party, she can invite who she wants. \nIt obviously would have been nicer if she had spoken to her friend, but I think OP was also concerned that Sam would push back on coming without dressing up, and then whining to the other girls if OP held firm, so OP decided to opt out of a potential argument. She does have to deal with the fallout of that choice though. \n\nIf this were a wedding, people would say your wedding, you\u2019re paying, you choose who the guests are.

I doubt a security team was part of the small budget for the event lol  \n\n\nNTA to me OP.", "This! Yes thank you!", "Right? We're not like those other nerds, we only read books recommended on booktok and that have instagram worthy covers. \\*flips hair\\*", "YES!!! OP\u2019s entire post is full of references focusing on image in various ways where they really don\u2019t need to. That was the first and most prominent thing I got from their post. They start with \u2018Our book club isn\u2019t too nerdy.\u2019 And then describing her friend\u2019s dress as casual but \u2018it\u2019s ok because she\u2019s a pretty girl.\u2019 Both of these things are defensively focused on image. OP has a book club. Really, that\u2019s no big deal. Even if you read about space elves as opposed to historical fiction, you still wouldn\u2019t need to defend it. And it doesn\u2019t really matter if friend is pretty or not in this instance. It shouldn\u2019t have a bearing on your friendship or on her invitation. And there is nothing about this situation in which the friend\u2019s prettiness or not prettiness is an issue. Friend wasn\u2019t trying to be a catalogue model or win a beauty contest.\n\nI think OP is YTA for not inviting or telling friend. She could have handed the invitation to her and told her that dressing up was required. Also, friend just might not know what she is doing or might not have the funds to buy a ball gown. The first (not knowing what she is doing) is something you can turn into a fun event or two! You can go shopping together. Then the day of, you can do your hair and makeup together. I was one of those girls who didn\u2019t always get dressy and part of that was because I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. But I did have a ton of fun when my friends would help me do my hair and makeup.\n\nI also think OP might be young and possibly insecure. \nOP\u2026I want to say this gently to OP. but don\u2019t stress so much about what random people think of you. Be considerate in public and all of that, but you should worry about what random people think about your book club. You should of course worry about your friends\u2019 feelings. And your friend being pretty or not shouldn\u2019t matter. There was a lot of focus on appearance in your post that actually doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nWith regards to your friend attending the event, I can definitely understand wanting people to dress up. And your friend should understand that. But if you want to maintain friendships, always think about doing what is right for them first. In an ideal situation, you would invite friend, friend would either dress up or tell you they couldn\u2019t attend as it\u2019s just not their thing, and both parties step away ok with the situation and continue their friendship.", "My point was more so to commentate on the negative bias the commenters are exhibiting than the post itself tbh. OP made 0 mention of filming or posting content and I feel like if that was the case, OP would be justifying their lack of an invite to their friend within the post itself by saying she\u2019d ruin the video, and if she didn\u2019t want the friend to know about the party, I don\u2019t think OP would post anything herself anyway.\n\nI mostly just feel like this particular topic overlaps the \u201ctiktok bad\u201d sentiment and the \u201cwomen and things popular with women are shallow\u201d bias in such a way that people are being unfairly severe in their criticisms because of it.\n\nBut yeah, ESH. By her response alone I immediately suspect the friend to be the type to show up dressed normally without any prior discussion if OP hadn\u2019t drilled the dress code into her head something fierce and that does sound exhausting for all sides, but it is technically the polite thing to do, so OP sucks too. Personally, this is why I don\u2019t host events.", "OP DID say so. Sam straight up said she would have attended in jeans.

Do I want to experience something with my friends I wouldn't normally do, yes. \n\nWe all grow in different ways. Having the opportunity to do something new with peeps I like, yeah, I may go out of my comfort zone. But not even given a choice really sucks.", "I think she should have sent the invite, but there is enough justification behind it that I don't think it makes OP the AH", "Of course they do, they're willing to bet the friendship against what the friend is trying to do and feel superior either way. Either they get what they want or they get to claim their former friend is just 'petty'.", "that would also have to be enforced. Nothing's to say OP's friend wouldn't show up and demand to be let in. Then the night's awkward and ruined for everybody.", "But I think you guys also missed this line:\n\n>She said she was upset that I wouldn\u2019t want her there even if she wore her regular clothes\n\nIn other words, OP was right that her friend would have worn regular clothes. \n\nSo this is really ESH.", "I'm the never wear a dress type, but if there was an option to wear a suit I'd totally wear it. That would be so cool. Yeah she should have at least asked the friend.", "In ours, the teachers were checking under the gowns to make sure we were still following the school's dress code.", "We had to return the rented gowns before we left the building, so the importance of wearing something under the gown was stressed, often.", "Yes, the issue is she wasn't given the option. Maybe she would've been comfortable going in men's formal attire instead of a dress and still been dressed up for the ball. Maybe she would have said no, or maybe she would have been offended OP had a dress code in which case she would have been the AH.\n\nBut intentionally excluding someone rather than letting them know they're welcome if they're willing to adhere to a dress code is AH behaviour. It would even have been fine to call her and say \"hey, I know this isn't your thing, but I'm hosting a ball with a mandatory dress code and I wasn't going to invite you because I know you hate that stuff, but if you would like to dress up and come you'd be very welcome.\"\n\nIt's an easy mistake to make. Most of us have excluded someone in this kind of situation before although usually it's because we know the other person would decline, not because we're worried they'd accept and ruin the aesthetic.", "It kind of sounds like a situation where there was bound to be an asshole though.

Having a book club isn't a bad thing. Having a cosplay party isn't a bad thing. Being a c word about the entire thing because you don't want to look like exactly what you are, that's a bad thing. OP seems like she's in denial and ashamed of her interests and cares way too much about what other people think about her.", "Unfortunately, OP isn't young, she's 29. Though I get thinking she's young. It's literally High School Mean Girls inviting EVERYONE to a party except ONE person. And doing it purposely and deliberately. \"You're not cool enough to come to OUR party. Too bad, not so sad\".", "I'm less inclined to judge Sam's initial reaction to it because of how badly OP botched it.  What if OP had gone to Sam before mailing invites and said \"Look, I'm having this formal dress party and I'd love to have you there but *only* if you come in costume like everyone else.  I know this isn't your thing and it's fine with me if you stay home, or if you'd rather, wear a fancy gentlemen's suit of the time and then you don't need makeup.  You absolutely can't come in jeans because then it wouldn't feel like the time warp historical dance that we want.  It's your choice.\"\n\nRemember, Sam didn't wear jeans to prom.  She just didn't go.  She probably wouldn't have gone to this, but to invite *everyone in the club but her* is a Regina George move.\n\nI have this suspicion that Sam might actually enjoy wearing a men's suit, but I'm a woman who hasn't worn a dress or skirt since the 90s and haven't worn more than lip gloss in at least a decade.  I don't want to read too much into it, but I wonder if OP has ever gotten Sam to open up about why she doesn't want to wear anything but jeans.\n\nThere's usually a reason.", "I was inclined to an E S H because of this. Until I read what Sam told Op once she heard about the party. She never told her that she didn't get the chance or that she would have been willing to, instead she literally told off OP for not being tolerant of her regular clothes despite of it being a special occasion. This is why I don't agree with everyone else placing the blame on OP. \n\n\nYes, people change and grow up. I don't doll up everyday, but I do when there is a special dress code. However, many people don't and expect to be included anyways. This is not the situation that implied that Sam has tried but for lack of resources or such her outfit doesn't fit. Sam doesn't try. And it is ok. But in that case you have to be willing to accept that you will be excluded from some events.", "I had cut-offs and a Fido Dido t-shirt under my graduation robe, with tights and nice shoes. No one said a thing about it. You know why? Because no one could see those clothes because they were covered by the robe. And this was in 1991 when things in general were stricter than they are now.", "Where's the justification?? She gave 2 examples, *from high school*! She didn't go to prom, probably because she didn't want to dress up & the other was jeans to a \"ceremony\" which some have gathered to mean graduation, which doesn't have a strict dress code & you're covered by a gown anyway. She said she \"doesn't care about her appearance even for formal events\" but doesn't really mention attire to these events other than not doing her hair & makeup. I doubt she'd show up to a wedding in sweats.  OP is the AH for the simple fact that she excluded her friend on the assumption she wouldn't dress up. Didn't even give her the option to decline. Now, had Sam showed up not dressed appropriately, then Sam would've likely been the AH, if *aesthetics* mattered more than a group of friends having fun.", "I don't know that that is making a statement that she WOULD wear casual clothes. More that her friend would exclude her just based on clothing. That she cared more about articles of clothing  than about including a friend. So appearance is more important than a friend's feelings. Plus Sam said IF she wore her regular clothes which indicates to me that she might have dressed up for this event but was getting a straight up answer about whether her friend actually cared more about what she WORE than about HER.", "My mom did ask if I was wearing clothes underneath after, she knows me well lol. She didn't even ask if I had my dress, she knew that was history, what she asked was \"are you even wearing are bra?\".", "Yeah, we were just required to be wearing clothes underneath, they didn't care what. I wore a casual baby doll dress with my Birkenstocks :).", "We were told we had to be wearing clothes because a graduate a year or two before had flashed the crowd. What made it hilarious was the flasher was the older sister of OUR Class President. When they made the announcement that we must be wearing clothes under our gowns, the ENTIRE class turned and looked at him.", "Bet it inspired brevity", "It actually shortened the speeches a bit, which was a blessing. Thankfully it wasn't my university grad, it was my grad from massage school, so smaller by far. My university grad I didn't bother showing up for, just got my diploma in the mail. It was like 4 hours long, not a chance I was sitting through that.", "That's the way I took it. That Sam was straight up asking if OP actually cares more about what she WORE than about HER. That how her friends look is more important than their inclusion.", "I don't understand what you mean.", "It likely would've still ended in the friend arguing with her. But not at the *same* place. This hurts the friend more than the alternative, looks worse to the other people in the club, and is just morally wrong where the alternative wouldn't have been. It's not okay to be mean to someone just because a kinder approach would still end up with the same results for you.", "In my experience, that reason is usually entitlement and stubbornness. \n\nBut your mileage may vary.", "I see where you're coming from. Difficult when you only hear one part of the story. Not saying you're wrong, but we don't have all the deets really. My bad for the assumptions.", "As I said, this was my experience with graduations. This was all 2012-2016. Some private, some public. Even guests had to dress a certain way. If the jeans at graduation thing was noteworthy, I'm assuming it's because she didn't follow the dress code.", "Moms usually know their children well. That\u2019s too funny! \ud83e\udd23", "Multiple times in the past, the friend has made stands against formal wear, including attending certain things in no formal wear. She\u2019s so far in the revolt against wearing the fancy clothes, that the implication can really only be accept me or screw off.", "That's fair, and it might be.\n\nBut if someone's a really good friend, that's not going to be my go-to initial assumption."]}
