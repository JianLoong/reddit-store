My parents were going through fertility treatments but gave up and adopted me. But then miraculously my mom got pregnant with Ray. \n\nI have been dating my bf Alex(23M) for a little more than a year. I still lived with my parents as they didn't want me to move out. Things were going great until my sister started to act weird and it's clear she developed a crush on Alex. She always tries to interfare whenever I have a conversation with Alex infront of her. She cuts me off and say things to demean me. One time I was just having girl talks with Ray and asked something like if she likes any boy/girl from her class. She said something like \"I'm not a sl*t like you. Next you'll probably get pregnant by that guy and make my parents care for your babies too\". I was surprised like wtf is wrong with her why so aggressive? I said something like \"I can assure you that won't happen\" and then just left.\n\nShe constantly compares my physical features with herself even infront of Alex. She also started to call me names like stick legs(I am recovering from an ED). Last week Alex was over to ours for dinner and Ray started to tell Alex how I got fat and I'll only get fatter if we date longer and marry someday. It's already hard for me to eat and after hearing that I couldn't eat anymore. Alex got kinda angry at her and told her it was a very mean thing to say to me. She started to cry and act like Alex screamed at her. Our parents got angry at me and Alex and told us we can't be mean to Ray and they will talk to Ray about her misbehaviour. Alex left immediately. Ray got kinda scolded and she was furious. She messaged me saying how I don't deserve to have someone like Alex as my bf, how I stole her parents, how I'm an ugly Chinese and should go back to my real parents. She also told me she likes Alex and she deserves him more than me as I'm ugly. I got angry too. Clearly the scolding our parents gave her didn't work at all. I went to her room and demand her to repeat the things she sent me through message . I screamed at her saying she needs a reality check and she'll never get a bf with an attitude that bad. I told her she was being mean and racist towards me. These all turned into a shouting match between us. It was middle of the night. Parents woke up and they tried to calm us down. We had a family meeting and they said I should move out as it's clear I and Ray clearly don't like each other anymore and I handled the situation terribly by screaming at her as she's just a kid.\n\nI already moved in with Alex though he has a roommate. We're looking for a new place.

Maybe therapy. This isn't normal behaviour and your parents are actively choosing to not to parent Ray properly because she is their golden child. She is 13. Old enough to understand racism, eating disorders and general rude behaviour. \n\nInstead of parenting her, your parents are trying to shift the blame on you just because you screamed at her poor upbringing. OP, you are NTA but Ray and your parents very much are.", "NTA. Your parents are horrible people. Good luck, you got this.", "INFO: Did you show your parents the messages?\n\nYou may not be their bio kid, but you are still their kid and Ray picked up this behavior from somewhere. That needs to be checked into.\n\nOr is she just the golden child because she's a miracle baby?\n\nNTA...but your parents certainly are.", "NTA. That kid needs to be taught a lesson.", "no ur not. even though 13 is a young age, she should know better at that age to not make fun of ones appearance especially if she knew u were recovering from an ED. Ur parents told u to move out cos she made fun out of u?? thats extreme just cos u screamed at her. Your parents and Ray are TA. u and ur bf aren't. I hope you guys find a new place soon and Im glad hes on ur side.", "First off, you're NTA here. She might be young, but she said some terrible things to you and you reacted in a way that's understandable.\n\nYour sister kind of sucks because she instigated this, and what she said is shitty and terrible, but I totally get where you're coming from where you say she's just a kid. I have friends who have taught middle schoolers, and they always describe them as little shits who \"understand how to be mean but don't understand the consequences of their meanness.\" Hopefully she learns a bit from this, because at 13 you're still growing up and I don't want to write someone off while they're still a kid.\n\nYour parents are the real assholes here, because they've failed to discipline your sister and show her the consequences of being shitty like that, both in this incident and in the many leading up to it. It's genuinely awful that they took her side so hard that they'd kick you out, and they should be ashamed of themselves. Playing favorites is bad, but doing that to this extent is fucking disgraceful.\n\nFortunately, it sounds like you have some friends you could count on and you aren't out on the street. I hope your life picks up from here, and please remember that you aren't the person at fault here.", "NTA at all\n\nAnd while your sister is an AH for her comments, that is typical teenager attitude(assuming her Chinese/ adoption comment was heat of the moment, not her attitude everyday). It\u2019s a byproduct of how she was raised. Note- im not defending your sister, nor saying it's ok, just saying teen siblings can have mouths.\n\nI'm more mad / astonished at how your parents reacted, and even during the dinner comment, seemed to 100% take your sister's side. Especially if they heard her adoption comment, and didn't defend you at all!", "NTA\n\nSorry OP\n\n\nI also hope your parents can address her jealousy issues.", "NTA your sister's a racist spoiled little kid  personally I'd go NC with the lot of them", "I was kind of leaning on ESH but I'm gunna go with NTA.\n\nShe openly insulted you while poking at an eating disorder then later flung a bunch of vile and racists comments at you. You're right in saying that the talk she got from your parents clearly didn't accomplish anything. Maybe you shouldn't have yelled at her the way you did, but I think anyone in your situation would have had a similar emotional response considering the context.\n\nAlso, your parents suck, this isn't a simple case of \"two people not getting along\". Asking you to move out was not the right solution here, though it sounds like that may be for the best. The things your sister said to you were terrible, and your parents need to address that behavior before she carries it into adulthood.", "You are NTA, but your \"\"\"family\"\"\" sure is.

Ray obviously sucks, and it would take an amazing amount of patience to deal with that, but at the same time, you're 19.

She\u2019s 13, how is she even a threat at all to your relationship? Clearly there are family dynamics issues that need to be worked out, the fault of that lies with everyone. Your parents for not correcting her and your sister for being so territorial. You specifically asked if you were the AH for the way you handled the situation and that you were, you could have handled this with more maturity of a 19yo. But obviously the boiling point that got you there was everything you seem to be living with, still not an excuse. So ESH is ultimately the only answer.", "NTA\n\nI don't think your sister is a racist. She made a racist remark to hurt your feelings. She's 13 and still immature. \nYou moving out is the best resolution for your situation.", "ESH. What she said was offside and while at 13, she should know better, at 19 so should you know better than to escalate. \n\nThat said, I feel huge chunks of this story are missing as no parent would tell one of their kids to GTFO over this so fill in the blanks please because no adult will buy your current story.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She let the kid get the better of her and acted petty, when she has the support of her boyfriend to escape her home life. The person(s) she should have been yelling at for this were her parents not her twit sister.", "Totally agree.", "So no, that\u2019s not how CPS works. Yes, they fucked up with what they did to OP when she was 4 and would be considered abuse **then**. If she were to call CPS now for that, it would get screened out as it\u2019s happened years ago. And if there\u2019s no abuse occurring now, CPS can\u2019t do anything. You\u2019re essentially saying use CPS as revenge. Please don\u2019t advocate such behavior.", ">Monitoring her internet usage is good, but what about the actual humans in her life?\n\nI've told them about that too definitely. \n\nShe acts like she's older than me. Sure, she's half a feet taller than me and I look younger but at the end of the day she's still 13.\n\nOne part of me doesn't want to contact them but I'm also concerned about her.", "She was 4 the first time it happened, so i wouldn't go based off her actions as her family is abusive", "I hate to be an armchair psychiatrist on here, but that really sounds like abuse. That's a level of not okay that gets cps called sometimes. And the fact that you think you having a tantrum justifies it clearly comes from their own messaging.\n\nI think they weren't ready to be parents even though they chose it and have some real problems with emotional regulation, which explains why your sister has none.\n\nI'm also getting shades of interracial adoption trauma and really wondering if the differences in their parenting of you and your sister have to do with race. I obviously don't know them so please don't think I'm saying they're racists. However, it's well documented that white parents (assuming from cultural clues they're white) who adopt children of different races can, unconsciously or consciously, harm them due to race and culture difference, prejudice, etc.\n\nGiven that you're in a place where you are excusing their abusive episodes, I honestly suggest talking to a mental health professional when you have the resources to do so. You might be carrying some stuff without knowing and getting help now will mean a healthier future.", "This honestly made me want to cry, I just had a daughter & there\u2019s no part of my being that can even fathom this. You & your boyfriend (who seems pretty cool by the way, nice & supportive) WILL create a whole new life together. It\u2019s gonna be ok, that kind of negativity in your life can only lead to bad things. Believe me.", "Nah, dude you are being too flexible with these people. You were 4, an age where you can be a brat, crying over random things and throwing tantrum. Sure, that is where parenting comes in but kicking you at out night is NOT parenting. Did they not take into consideration of who may be lurking out there? Bless your aunt for bringing you back in and having some sense.", "I don't at all mean this in a condescending way, but oh, honey. This whole story is absolutely horrific. I'm so sorry this happened to you.", "I'm just going to echo what other people here are saying. That is not normal parenting behavior. That's abuse. And kicking you out now, rather than dealing with your sister's bad behavior? That's also abuse. \n\nStay safe. If you're able to, meet with a therapist. I'm guessing there's a whole lot more that you've accepted as \"normal\" which really, really isn't.", "There's absolutely zero justification for this. My 4yo throws tantrums constantly, and about the dumbest kid stuff. Like she'll have 25 stuffed animals on her bed and need the one that isn't there. I've never kicked her out of the house. \n\nHonestly, your parents aren't \"better now\", and they don't regret the way they parented you. And that's entirely evident by how they kicked you out AGAIN over your sister being cruel.\n\nETA: NTA and I'd honestly remove them, at least temporarily, for your mental health. You should absolutely seek therapy if you haven't already, just to unpack all the trauma and abuse your parents put you through.", "Sweetie, that is not normal. At all. Like others have said, it\u2019s abusive.", "Those aren\u2019t parents.", "So you continue to defend them.. OK.. Good luck.", "I am sorry but I cannot fathom that your parents mistreating you so horribly during your early childhood had no impact on your mental health. Please please please keep getting the care you deserve!", "Honey\u2026 Can you access a therapist? Are you in college/university? Can you reach out to student counselling? \n\nWhat you are describing - both at age 4 and in this situation - is abuse and neglect. That combined with the ED makes me feel like you would really benefit from having a trauma informed person to talk to. \n\nOften we don\u2019t realize how harmful a situation is while we are in it because our brain is designed to survive it does what it needs to to keep us going. But once we are out of the situation it all kind of hits us\u2026 I\u2019m concerned that now you are out, if you don\u2019t have some support, your ED will kick back in and you might start having other mental health stuff come up. \n\nYou are NTA here. Please put yourself first for the best little while. Consider going low contact. Hugs from an internet stranger.", "You can't make CPS revive Ray. If there's something going on that you report, they'll (hopefully) investigate. At that point, if they remove Ray, no one will be stealing her parents, they'll be *saving her from further abuse*.", "You couldn\u2019t make them remove her anyways. They have to investigate occurring abuse in the home. And as there isn\u2019t any abuse right now, there\u2019s not much they could do. Yes, their behaviors towards you in this situation have been unkind and messed up. It honestly would be best to remove yourself from them for awhile. Especially if they can\u2019t see how badly they messed up. I certainly hope things get better and they realize they need to parent your sister better and probably get her into therapy. If your sister can\u2019t behave accordingly. Cut ties. NTA OP", "OP, please listen. My dad is a pretty good father to my brother. In fact, he's a much better father to him than he ever was to my sister and I. I understand that you don't want to hurt them or Ray, and I'm not suggesting that you call CPS. But you should still really try to look at it from the pov that your parents not only didn't protect you, but they abused you. Whether they caused your ED or not, their abuse probably had a huge impact to the point it opened you up to developing an ED.", ">One part of me doesn't want to contact them but I'm also concerned about her.\n\nVery understandable!\n\nCould you try to have a chat with your parents when she's at school?\n\nAt best, she's hanging out with a crowd that's way too old for her. Still, she's pretty young to be acting all 13-going-on-35", "You've done your best. If your parents have made up their mind to disregard you, you can't change them. Take care of your own mental health - beating your head against their brick wall isn't going to help your sister and will just harm you. Good luck.", "Fucking. This.", "Don't forget that OP is recovering from an ED. I wonder if she is in therapy for this already. She may not realize just how much trauma she has to unpack from her upbringing.", "Throwing out a kid at 4 is definitely abusive.", "Can you please elaborate what abuse there is? Did they treat situation poorly? Absolutely. Yes the whole situation with OP at 4 would most definitely have been a case for abuse for CPS to look into. But as I can see right now, there\u2019s nothing for them to remove the sister. They could ask the parents to do parenting and ask to do family counseling but that would be about it. I worked in CPS for quite sometime. It\u2019s a lot more nuanced than people think it is\u2026", "Not to mention what started this all, which is that Ray is using her crush on an adult 10 years her senior to justify acting out. While it is normal for teenagers to have crushes on people older than them, it is Not normal for her to say she \u201cdeserves\u201d him while being racist and abusive towards OP. Having outsiders like CPS or school officials get involved might help if it prevents her from trying to get involved with another older man in the future."]}
