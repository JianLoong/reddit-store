My parents were going through fertility treatments but gave up and adopted me. But then miraculously my mom got pregnant with Ray. \n\nI have been dating my bf Alex(23M) for a little more than a year. I still lived with my parents as they didn't want me to move out. Things were going great until my sister started to act weird and it's clear she developed a crush on Alex. She always tries to interfare whenever I have a conversation with Alex infront of her. She cuts me off and say things to demean me. One time I was just having girl talks with Ray and asked something like if she likes any boy/girl from her class. She said something like \"I'm not a sl*t like you. Next you'll probably get pregnant by that guy and make my parents care for your babies too\". I was surprised like wtf is wrong with her why so aggressive? I said something like \"I can assure you that won't happen\" and then just left.\n\nShe constantly compares my physical features with herself even infront of Alex. She also started to call me names like stick legs(I am recovering from an ED). Last week Alex was over to ours for dinner and Ray started to tell Alex how I got fat and I'll only get fatter if we date longer and marry someday. It's already hard for me to eat and after hearing that I couldn't eat anymore. Alex got kinda angry at her and told her it was a very mean thing to say to me. She started to cry and act like Alex screamed at her. Our parents got angry at me and Alex and told us we can't be mean to Ray and they will talk to Ray about her misbehaviour. Alex left immediately. Ray got kinda scolded and she was furious. She messaged me saying how I don't deserve to have someone like Alex as my bf, how I stole her parents, how I'm an ugly Chinese and should go back to my real parents. She also told me she likes Alex and she deserves him more than me as I'm ugly. I got angry too. Clearly the scolding our parents gave her didn't work at all. I went to her room and demand her to repeat the things she sent me through message . I screamed at her saying she needs a reality check and she'll never get a bf with an attitude that bad. I told her she was being mean and racist towards me. These all turned into a shouting match between us. It was middle of the night. Parents woke up and they tried to calm us down. We had a family meeting and they said I should move out as it's clear I and Ray clearly don't like each other anymore and I handled the situation terribly by screaming at her as she's just a kid.\n\nI already moved in with Alex though he has a roommate. We're looking for a new place. This whole situation is just terrible.", "created_utc": 1683900578, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fmaga/aita_for_screaming_at_my_13_year_old_sister/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe therapy. This isn't normal behaviour and your parents are actively choosing to not to parent Ray properly because she is their golden child. She is 13. Old enough to understand racism, eating disorders and general rude behaviour. \n\nInstead of parenting her, your parents are trying to shift the blame on you just because you screamed at her poor upbringing. OP, you are NTA but Ray and your parents very much are.", "NTA. Your parents are horrible people. Good luck, you got this.", "INFO: Did you show your parents the messages?\n\nYou may not be their bio kid, but you are still their kid and Ray picked up this behavior from somewhere. That needs to be checked into.\n\nOr is she just the golden child because she's a miracle baby?\n\nNTA...but your parents certainly are.", "NTA. That kid needs to be taught a lesson.", "no ur not. even though 13 is a young age, she should know better at that age to not make fun of ones appearance especially if she knew u were recovering from an ED. Ur parents told u to move out cos she made fun out of u?? thats extreme just cos u screamed at her. Your parents and Ray are TA. u and ur bf aren't. I hope you guys find a new place soon and Im glad hes on ur side.", "First off, you're NTA here. She might be young, but she said some terrible things to you and you reacted in a way that's understandable.\n\nYour sister kind of sucks because she instigated this, and what she said is shitty and terrible, but I totally get where you're coming from where you say she's just a kid. I have friends who have taught middle schoolers, and they always describe them as little shits who \"understand how to be mean but don't understand the consequences of their meanness.\" Hopefully she learns a bit from this, because at 13 you're still growing up and I don't want to write someone off while they're still a kid.\n\nYour parents are the real assholes here, because they've failed to discipline your sister and show her the consequences of being shitty like that, both in this incident and in the many leading up to it. It's genuinely awful that they took her side so hard that they'd kick you out, and they should be ashamed of themselves. Playing favorites is bad, but doing that to this extent is fucking disgraceful.\n\nFortunately, it sounds like you have some friends you could count on and you aren't out on the street. I hope your life picks up from here, and please remember that you aren't the person at fault here.", "NTA at all\n\nAnd while your sister is an AH for her comments, that is typical teenager attitude(assuming her adoption comment was heat of the moment, not her attitude everyday). Note- im not defending your sister, nor saying it's ok, just saying teen siblings can have mouths.\n\nI'm more mad / astonished at how your parents reacted, and even during the dinner comment, seemed to 100% take your sister's side. Especially if they heard her adoption comment, and didn't defend you at all!", "NTA\n\nSorry OP\n\n\nI also hope your parents can address her jealousy issues.", "NTA your sister's a racist spoiled little kid  personally I'd go NC with the lot of them", "I was kind of leaning on ESH but I'm gunna go with NTA.\n\nShe openly insulted you while poking at an eating disorder then later flung a bunch of vile and racists comments at you. You're right in saying that the talk she got from your parents clearly didn't accomplish anything. Maybe you shouldn't have yelled at her the way you did, but I think anyone in your situation would have had a similar emotional response considering the context.\n\nAlso, your parents suck, this isn't a simple case of \"two people not getting along\". Asking you to move out was not the right solution here, though it sounds like that may be for the best. The things your sister said to you were terrible, and your parents need to address that behavior before she carries it into adulthood.", "You are NTA, but your \"\"\"family\"\"\" sure is. They clearly don't care about you, so I hope you can find people that do.", "NTA\n\nBut...\n\n>She messaged me saying how I don't deserve to have someone like Alex as my bf, how I stole her parents, how I'm an ugly Chinese and should go back to my real parents. She also told me she likes Alex and she deserves him more than me as I'm ugly.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if much of her racism comes from the increase in anti-Asian comments from certain politicians and their followers, not that that justifies it at all.\n\nHowever, **while her racism is concerning, there** ***has*** **to be something more to her comments that she, a 13-year-old, deserves OP's 24-year-old boyfriend more than OP does.**\n\n***I find her behavior toward OP's boyfriend extremely worrying as it sounds excessive for a normal, happy 13-year-old with a simple teenager crush.***\n\nSadly, OP's parents probably won't bother to see if there's something else going on as it's just so much simpler to kick OP out and claim that it's all due to just \"not getting along.\"\n\nI wonder if she has Alex's contact details. **Now that she no longer has access to him in person, she may well try to contact Alex directly**.", "NTA", "Do I have to vote? Or can I just say that family counseling without judgment might be a better place to ask these questions.", "I mean... Ray obviously sucks, and it would take an amazing amount of patience to deal with that, but at the same time, you're 19. Your reaction is completely understandable, but you let a 13-year-old drag you into a screaming match, so I'm going to say ESH.\n\nIncluding your parents.\n\nI really want to know how they reacted when/if you showed them the message Ray sent you. \n\nAbout Ray...\n\n1) It's a pretty weird delusion she has that she can date a guy who's 23. I wonder if she has interacted similarly with anyone else who's clearly too old for her, because that can be dangerous.\n\n2) I wonder if someone else has been putting ideas in her head\u2014it's hard to figure how she would independently take on the perspective that you stole her parents when you've shared your parents for her whole life. And I presume she didn't pick up the racism at home.", "The thing I can\u2019t get over is why does her crush on your boyfriend bother you so much. She\u2019s 13, how is she even a threat at all to your relationship? Clearly there are family dynamics issues that need to be worked out, the fault of that lies with everyone. Your parents for not correcting her and your sister for being so territorial. You specifically asked if you were the AH for the way you handled the situation and that you were, you could have handled this with more maturity of a 19yo. But obviously the boiling point that got you there was everything you seem to be living with, still not an excuse. So ESH is ultimately the only answer.", "NTA\n\nI don't think your sister is a racist. She made a racist remark to hurt your feelings. She's 13 and still immature. \nYou moving out is the best resolution for your situation.", "ESH. What she said was offside and while at 13, she should know better, at 19 so should you know better than to escalate. \n\nThat said, I feel huge chunks of this story are missing as no parent would tell one of their kids to GTFO over this so fill in the blanks please because no adult will buy your current story.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The fact that she knew she could say that stuff to you in front of them and then YOU and Alex get in trouble for responding? What the heck? They allowed her racism to go unchecked. And they have not taught her how to deal with her emotions well.\n\nTeen girls having crushes on their older sister's partners is a tale as old as time. The fact that she thinks she can bully you out of your relationship with him and harbors ideas that she could/should be with him is a real problem. It's not like you're 15 and he's 16, he's 23!
