He got upset because he said I was acting like he's homophobic for not being into the scene, which I wasn't. He said I don't get what it's like to see a sex scene I don't enjoy. Which is crazy? It's not like we're jacking off to them. Now I was annoyed and I told him if he wanted to he can close his eyes and plug his ears.

No.. just making your friend uncomfortable", "Awwww", "my ex was sexually assaulted and anything dealing with sexual assault would trigger her so I dont see how thats unlikely", "Is any sex scene actually part of the plot, because he watched all kinds of other sex scenes before with no problem.\n\nOP is watching it because it is a part of the film.\n\nLook, I'm described from enslaved people, and I can watch \"Birth of a Nation,\" or even \"Gone with the Wind.\" Both absolutely make me uncomfortable, however, being unfortunately and then interrogating why something does so it's the only way we grow as humans. Growth has never killed anybody yet.", "If they\u2019ve watched other sex scenes (including lesbian ones!), then absolutely.

If i want to see a sex scene or performance I can just watch porn instead.", "Op actually explained in the post why he feels that that sex scenes are important and how they can matter to a movie\u2026. So yeah, to the op it was. Don\u2019t minimize what matters to op just because the other person didn\u2019t wanna watch it. You can make that choice for yourself, not for everyone watching", "Well, his excuse is that he shouldn\u2019t have to watch a sex scene that he isn\u2019t into (i.e., won\u2019t turn him on), not that there was a history of sexual assault or trauma. It\u2019s unlikely that his reasoning has to do with sexual assault.", "\"He said I don't get what it's like to see a sex scene I don't enjoy.\"- the friend here is clearly implying the issue with this scene is him not being attracted to two men having sex. Not him being traumatized or stressed by gay sex. He also is not observed by his friend, (who hopefully cares about him to notice)  to be triggered; he just seems annoyed. You say anything about sexual abuse could trigger your ex, which makes sense, but in this situation it was a scene of men consensually having sex, so I don't imagine that would be anywhere near as triggering as a depiction of non-consensual stuff which is obviously triggering. Also my point still stands, it's the triggered person's job to get up and take a break to protect themselves not police other people", "I'm surprised your able to even be on Reddit if your so prudish you think sex scenes in films are comparable to porn \ud83d\ude02", "what if it was private? I know many people that dont talk about their experiences with sexual assault.", "you cant interpret how a sexual assault victim feels or what triggers them tho. Saying the scene is consensual doesnt just automatically make someone sensitive to consenting male on male relationships. I myself was sexually assaulted by a male years ago and i can never have a sexual relationship with a guy because of it. I can relate to this particular arguement.", "Bruh I'm not prudish even. I just don't care about sex scenes in movies, they're mostly bad anyway lol.", "He literally gave his reasoning as being because it\u2019s a sex scene that he doesn\u2019t get to enjoy. It\u2019s because he doesn\u2019t feel attracted to male on male sex scenes like he does to sex scenes involving women.", "I'm not saying it's wrong to be triggered by anything at all, it is a part of recover to accept it is what it is and not feel shame about that.and sure it can be hard to notice if someone is triggered. Its just also a fact that statistically speaking, because of the 1. nature of the scene not being violent 2. the guy just seeming upset because he doesn't like gay sex 3. and becoming very defensive about being homophobic, it's more likely this is a having an issue with gay people thing, and not a trauma thing. Sure it's a possibility but with the evidence, really really less likely than him being a wee-bit homophobic. My partner was assaulted as well and the pain he feels breaks my heart, but when he's triggered by something, he does what I do when I'm triggered, get up, and take a break. he doesn't police other people's behavior. I also am a SA survivor (same guy who hit me surprise surprise) and I appreciate the empathy you have for male survivors, I just think in this case, it's a different situation", "But I don't understand why you would skip them as they are part of the film. You could miss parts of dialog or other things that are part of the plot. I watched a TV program the other day where there was very mild sex scenes but something happened in them that was essential to understand the main storyline of the episode. If you had skipped them you would have been very confused to what was happening!. \n\n\nI hope you not one of those people who watch a film and skip all the bits they feel are bad/boring \ud83d\ude31 I can never understand people who do that!", "If it has a purpose and is tied to the plot of the movie, I have no problem watching it. If it's randomly put in for no reason I can skip it.", "But how do you know?\n\nIn the episode I'm talking about you see the start of a sex scene then 20 seconds later you see why it's important to the plot. But you will have already started skipping it by then and miss that bit \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nI just don't get why your skipping sex scenes if your not prudish?. \n\nYes they can have no real purpose but then so can many other types of scenes in films and you can't really tell what has a purpose and what doesn't unless you watch it first.", "If I skipped it and have been wrong in my judgement about it being unnecessary, I'll go back and watch it to get it. I rarely watch movies by now due to not being interested in them. As for why I would skip them for reasons other than sometimes being put in for no reason, I just don't feel like watching things I could do with my gf instead."]}
