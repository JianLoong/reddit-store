It's not like it was a VCR tape you left in your tv, and came on when the tv was turned on. It was ON a camera, IN a closet, and hell yes she was snooping.

If you decide to tolerate it, you still shouldn't tolerate her refusal to admit that what she did was snooping and that it was wrong. At a bare minimum, she needs to admit that:\n\n* She did snoop.\n\n* It was her fault and only her fault that she saw the video. \n\n* It was wrong of her to snoop. \n\n* It was ten times more wrong for her to watch the video. \n\n* It was also wrong for her to blame you. \n\nShe needs to apologize for all those things and then acknowledge that you did not do anything wrong before explaining what she will do to improve her behavior moving forward. Then she needs to show you proof that she is actually doing the necessary work to improve her behavior.\n\nIf she won't do that, and if you stay with her anyway, you will be miserable.", "Nice snooping+gaslighting combo, good thing you found out about that early.\n\nSounds like an insecurity that she's projecting on you, she has either cheated or been cheated on before.\n\nEither way this kind of behavior two months into a relationship is a MASSIVE red flag. Even if you had been dating for a year there'd be nothing wrong with keeping the spicy video with your ex for yourself.\n\nThe fact that she got you to back down and apologize to her so quickly, tells me she's experienced with this kind of manipulation.You did NOTHING wrong and SHE is the one who should be apologizing for invading your privacy.

You should be stating it for a fact.  \n\n\n And, then she says had to watch it.

She did indeed snoop and I would drop her over this.  I wouldn\u2019t trust her in my house.  She did more than the look in the bathroom cabinet for dental floss.  She had to work to find that.

It was nice of her to agree to look after your cat, but it feels like she was using that as an in to snoop... which she did.
