Of nothing in particular, just knick knacks and things I like. More like a maximalist lol. I also still reside with my parents.\n\nSomething about my family is that we gather at least once a week. My nephew (8, M) has always had an attachment to me, it\u2019s clear that he idolizes me. Almost every time the family gets together, he\u2019ll come into my room and look at specific things and say \u201coooh I like that!\u201d Or \u201ccan I see that?\u201d And basically just asks to get his grimly little fingers all over things. Now, I don\u2019t say grimy little fingers lightly. I don\u2019t mean to trash talk my little nephew but I\u2019ve seen where he puts his hands, and more importantly, how often he washes them. So yes, he knows the answer will be NO about 89% of the time.\n\nNow, a few weeks ago he came in asking about a specific fidget spinner that look like the rims on my car, that\u2019s kept away in a little case that I keep open displayed on a shelf above my bed. Not something I often touch anymore. I, of course, told him he didn\u2019t need to look at it right now. A week or two later, I for some noticed the little case was closed. I opened it up and it was empty. \n\nI decided to text my brother, and I just let him know that his son came in asking about it and now it\u2019s missing. I asked if he could investigate basically. He freaked out and just responded with telling me I\u2019m an AH for accusing his son.  \n\nThe next day I got a text from my brother saying that he found my fidget spinner in his son\u2019s backpack. I retrieved it from him and it was absolutely trashed. It\u2019s scratched, it\u2019s dented, it\u2019s colour is dull, it doesn\u2019t spin anymore. So, I just let my brother know that I was kinda disappointed to see it wrecked. I never had malicious intent. \n\nBut again, he freaked out at me and told me I needed to grow up, I needed to stop trying to make him feel guilty, for some reason I had to get my head outta my behind. But you know, he said it a little differently. I never received an apology, which to be fair, I didn\u2019t ask for. I was just absolutely taken aback by the aggression? Since this, I haven\u2019t been around the family gatherings because it\u2019ll just be uncomfortable and now my parents are telling I\u2019m the AH. They haven\u2019t stood up for me once, and now are telling to just get over it so things can go back to normal. They say I\u2019m hurting the family for not wanting to be around those who so clearly don\u2019t respect me.\n\nI guess I\u2019m wondering AITA for not just getting over this?", "created_utc": 1676775373, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/115zq5e/aita_for_telling_my_brother_his_kid_stole/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

NTA", "NTA.\n\nYour brother is the asshole. If he was a real man/adult/parent, he would have replaced what his son stole and made his son return the damaged item in person and told his son your room is off limits from now on. Instead he blows up at you, the actual victim here. He's a loser with an anger problem.\n\nYour parents are weak enablers. Family peace is never worth giving in to bullies or sacrificing your integrity. They're hurting the family by enabling a bully and encouraging weakness and lack of integrity and appeasement. You keep rocking the boat and send them a link to the boat rocking post along with a message about how disappointed in them you are.\n\nDon't second guess yourself. Set firm boundaries for your nephew, your brother and your parents. And hold your head high, my dude.", "NTA.  Your brother should apologize.  Make sure you lock your door when the nephew is over.   \n\nIt makes no sense for him to attack you like that.  I understand your parents just wanting the peace, but they should support you as well.  \n\nMaybe you can work it out.  I don't know, they sound kind of awful.", "Disappointing, but not surprising. Teachers deal with this all the time now - kids mess up, make mistakes (as kids do) and the parents want to shoot the messenger. Your brother is TA and, it sounds like, a bad parent. NTA", "NTA. all you did was feel upset about seeing something you treasured broken (which is 100% understandable). and your brother gets mad at YOU? for feeling upset? ik kids are bound to break shit but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t be upset over shit they choose to break. especially when it\u2019s clear it should not be touched. you literally didn\u2019t even get pissed at the kid idk WHY your brother is so mad at you", "NTA. He needs to know that his kid is a thief so he can correct his behavior. Also him telling you to grow up is messed up when his kid is the one stealing.", "NTA exactly, but you don't need to avoid your family over it. \n\nYour brother's reaction is likely a combination of guilt and embarrassment. He knows his son took it, he knows the condition it was returned in. Your brother's guilt is his own responsibility. Any discomfort that happens will be HIS fault, not yours.", "NTA. Your brother is not doing his kid any favors by not making him apologize and own up to his mistake. Not that out of the ordinary for a kid that age, but he missed a big teaching moment. Your brother is TAH.", "NTA\n\nYour assumptions weren't baseless, You had reason's that would lead any normal person into believing that the nephew took it. \n\nYour brother is kind of a jack ass, and quite fankly should be using this as a learning experience for his son, rather than dismissing you and treating you like crap over it.", "NTA. His overreaction sounds like some type of projection or insecurity about his son\u2019s behavior. A normal reaction would be for him to have a talk with his son and help his son figure out how to address it with you (I.E. apology, buying you a new one, etc).", "NTA, and simply don't put up with it.  Nephew isn't allowed in your space, isn't allowed to handle your things anymore.  Period.", "You didn\u2019t *accuse* your nephew. You asked your brother if he would check because of the circumstances. I can\u2019t stand when parents get mad if you even hint that their child did something wrong. Kids are not angels, and they do wrong things often. So it shouldn\u2019t be outside the scope of reality for your brother to believe maybe his son took the item. \n  \n    \n  \nDefending bad behavior, deflecting from the issue at hand, \u201ccounterattacking\u201d, etc, is a really great way to raise entitled, bad kids.   \n  \n  \nHim saying you needed to stop trying to make him feel guilty? Guilt is an appropriate feeling when we do something wrong. He felt guilty because he was guilty- he got mad at you, called you an AH, and now the item is ruined and he knows his son is responsible. \n  \n   \n  \nHe should\u2019ve apologized to you sincerely and made your nephew admit what he did and apologize to you too. \n  \n  \n  \nNTA.", "NTA, sounds like the dad is feeling insecure and embarrassed that you were right his son stole from you. Instead of apologizing he is making it about you to try and feel better about the shit his kid pulled. Promise you thats not the only time his son has just taken something.", "NTA. Your brother needs to teach his kid you don't steal. You ask he found get over it his kid stole. I don't like a thief age doesn't matter. Not sure where grow up comes into it play.", "What's worse than a stealing kid is his parents enabling it. \n\nYou are the NTA and his father will have to face much bigger troubles if he does not teach his son good manners or general law.", "Ahhhh, yes. The good old \"We want you to just put up with this terrible behaviour towards you and be Nice so that we don't have to be uncomfortable and/or inconvenienced by having to do something about it\". Your NTA but you family sure are, from your grotty, thieving nephew (who is just a kid who needs to be better educated), your blame shifting brother, and your push over parents.", "When i was about five, i wanted chewing gum at the grocery stire checkout. Dad said no. When he turned his back, i took it. An hour later at home he saw me chewing gum, searched me and found the juicy fruit in my pocket. He whipped me old school, then drove me to the grocery store, made me pay for it, apologize to the cashier, then whipped me out the door and across the parking lot in full view of everyone. 40 years later i caught my five year old daughter stealing caramels from the candy display at my grocery store. I didnt whip her, but she was verbally punished and forc d to pay and apologize\u2026i never stole again, and my daughter has never stilen again\u2026\n\nYnta.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I found out later from someone else. The next morning I talked to her and explained that I understood it was an accident but she needs to be honest and tell me when something like that happens. My brother bought me a new one (which I told him was unnecessary (but nice nonetheless).  It\u2019s odd with that much family togetherness that people aren\u2019t communicating more readily"]}
