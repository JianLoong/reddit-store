It's way too big for me or us but the price was too good to pass up.  He isn't emotionally attached to the house or anything. He bought it after his divorce and it has been his party house ever since.  \n\nI had enough for the downpayment and because of the price I paid I can pay the property taxes added to the mortgage and still be paying less than I would be for anything else that I would buy in my city.  \n\nBut now my fiancee is mad that I bought our first home without involving her.  \n\nI said I would have no problem selling the house and picking one with her and we could use my equity to put a huge downpayment on a house she approved of.  \n\nShe said that wasn't the point and that I was a dick for cutting her out of such a huge decision.  \n\nI don't know what I did wrong.  I could sell the house today for nearly $125,000 more than I paid for it.  Without any work.  If I clean it up and paint it I could get more.  \n\nHer friends are on her side but my friends and family think I was right to jump at such a great opportunity.   \n\nI called my uncle and he asked him if he cared what I did with the house.  He said no, that he just wanted to give me a head start on life since he couldn't pay back my dad who paid for his university when my grandparents disowned him.  My dad passed away a long time ago and my mom and stepdad raised me. My uncle always gave me great gifts but I never knew why.  \n\nSorry if my story is disjointed.  \n\nAITA?\n\n#EDIT\n\nThe reason I didn't discuss it with my fiancee is because I don't really think of this as a home for us.  I was thinking we fix it up and flip it.", "created_utc": 1673196351, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106nq5z/aita_for_buying_a_house_without_consulting_my/", "score": 3675, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The issue is this: She wanted to be included in your decision as an equal member of the team. It sounds like she even wanted her name to be on the paperwork. You are in a committed relationship, but made a unilateral decision. Was it a wise financial decision? Yes. Was it your right to do so given that the two of you are not married? Yes. Was it a great decision for your relationship? No. You\u2019ve shown her you\u2019re more than capable of disregarding her input about things that affect both of you, and that doesn\u2019t bode well for marriage. It even sounds like you may have HIDDEN what you did, given that buying a house is not something you wrap up in an afternoon. Have you sat down and sorted out your thoughts about why you did that?", "So basically you just bought yourself a bachelor pad.", "Why didn\u2019t you ever tell her about this before you did it? It\u2019s not a bad deal but she was never presented with the option of even weighing in. I would be afraid of your next major financial decision would also be done alone and not with your partner. She\u2019s not mad that it\u2019s a great deal, it\u2019s that for some reason you did it \u201cfor the two of you\u201d but you did it without her.

Then treat it as such.\n\nAcknowledge she\u2019s feeling powerless in the decision making due to her financial situation. Decide explicitly if indeed you are not taking her input until she has money to put in - if that\u2019s not the case, your behavior is not syncing up with your intentions. \n\nTo summarise: imho Partners bounce ideas and life decisions off each other - you\u2019re showing her she\u2019s not that to you, and she thinks it\u2019s down to her not putting any cash in.

It does not address your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s desire to buy your shared home. And the way that you went about buying your uncle\u2019s home makes the situation look so much worse: You didn\u2019t tell her about the offer or purchase; she has no stake in this house and thus doesn\u2019t own it; and your argument that you can sell it and use the money for a downpayment undermines her whole desire to split the costs for your first marital home. Basically, your plan makes financial sense, and you seem to be trying to plan for the long-term \u2026 but the way that you handled this entire situation makes it looks like you were trying to cut your fianc\u00e9e out of a major purchase and undermines the trust in your relationship.", "YTA \n\nYou don\u2019t claim you want to spend the rest of your life with someone only to make such a huge decision (which takes no less than 30 days to process) without at least consulting her.

So you lied by omission for weeks. And you don't think you did anything wrong?\n\nWhy didn't you tell her?", "YTA.

She's your fiancee, you two are supposed to be building a life together, therefore any significant decision should done collaboratively.  The line on what counts as a significant decision will vary from couple to couple, but suffice it to say buying a house will always be above that line.\n\nI will say that if it is as sweetheart of a deal as you are suggesting, then you would be foolish to pass on it.  But that doesn't excuse the methods you used to get there.  The process matters just as much as the end result in terms of relationships, and you just proved to her that you're willing to go behind her back to get what you want if the conditions are right.  She should be pissed at you.\n\nLet's envision a slightly different scenario that could have very easily happened here.  You buy this house from your uncle, then discover two months after purchase there is significant foundation damage to it (let's assume this is not anything your uncle hid from you, just that it was at this point it became apparent).  Now instead of owning a house on a sweetheart deal that you can leverage into greater assets later, you own a seriously damaged house that's going to require a large sum of money to repair and might be difficult to sell.  And further, there's no guarantee this house is the type of house you and your fiancee want or is in an area convenient to either of your careers.  That would be a big freakin' problem that you've just gotten you and her into and you never consulted her on it.\n\nI don't know how you go about making it right, but start with apologizing and acknowledging what you did was incredibly inconsiderate to your fiancee.", "If you don\u2019t already know that big financial decisions should be made together, you should probably postpone the wedding and start premarital counseling.

I don\u2019t blame you for taking the deal, but you should have given your fianc\u00e9e the heads up about it first,\n\nAlso just a quick warning, if you do flip the property, in my country it would be considered to be an adventure in the nature of trade and be taxable as business income, so you may want to put some of the profits aside for taxes before you reinvest all of them in a new house.", "E s h but YTA for not telling her. \n\nand y\u2019all need premarital counseling because neither of you are getting it. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t get to unilaterally decide the timeline for a house purchase. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to unilaterally decide the timeline for a house purchase. \n\nYou\u2019re going to be married.

It likely was the best financial choice but you should have still discussed it with her instead of blindsiding her completely.", "Yeah YTA. She's your fiance. Big life decisions should be discussed. How did you even buy a house without it coming up in conversation during the process?", "YTA for not involving your fianc\u00e9, the person you want to spend the rest of your life with, in a major life decision.

Your fianc\u00e9e absolutely has a right to be mad that her supposed life partner bought a house without including her in the decision.  Healthy couples make major life decisions as a team.

I'd bet she's wondering how many more financial situations she will be cut out of once married. \n\nI mean, I don't think you're under any obligations to anyone about accepting what is essentially a big gift from your uncle. But the way you went about it seems so secretive I can see why she feels upset. \n\n\nSoft YTA\n\nEdit- after seeing your edit, it pushes it even more to YTA.

The position you are in with your uncle is very fortunate and regardless of being set to make $125k or $125m, you should communicate with your fiance just out of respect. \n\nAgain, buying the house seems a no brainer.

You showed them you don't consider them a partner.  \n\nIt's very likely that your fiance may have agreed with you about the house.  But she wasn't given the opportunity to give any input.  I highly doubt it's the house she's upset about, it's the utter disregard for her as a partner.  Your reasoning is that you didn't talk to her because it wasn't going to be a home, but a flip, yet you see nothing wrong with that?  You spent your life savings without talking to her about it.

You don't need permission from her to purchase a house but if you randomly purchased this house without letting her know then you are TA. My partner always runs things by me just to make sure I'm aware and asks my opinion but ultimately if he wants it and has the money he can do it. It's not that hard to communicate big purchases lol. She probably feels upset that you didn't involve her in the process of your first home together... You seriously need to sit down and talk to her and ask her to explain why she is upset about this house. Was it because it's ugly or was it because you did not make her feel included in something that's supposed to be a milestone in the relationship? For that YA but ultimately it's your money.", "YTA for not even considering talking to her about this before doing it. You're planning on spending your life with this person, so you should get why she sees red flags if you can do something so huge without even bothering to mention it to her.  Buying a house takes time, but you couldn't find 30 seconds to even send a text?!

I don\u2019t know what prices are going like where you live or what you could afford but I\u2019d suggest keeping it at the payments you pay now with the 125 down payment.

It's way too big for me or us but the price was too good to pass up.  He isn't emotionally attached to the house or anything. He bought it after his divorce and it has been his party house ever since.  \n\nI had enough for the downpayment and because of the price I paid I can pay the property taxes added to the mortgage and still be paying less than I would be for anything else that I would buy in my city.  \n\nBut now my fiancee is mad that I bought our first home without involving her.  \n\nI said I would have no problem selling the house and picking one with her and we could use my equity to put a huge downpayment on a house she approved of.  \n\nShe said that wasn't the point and that I was a dick for cutting her out of such a huge decision.  \n\nI don't know what I did wrong.  I could sell the house today for nearly $125,000 more than I paid for it.  Without any work.  If I clean it up and paint it I could get more.  \n\nHer friends are on her side but my friends and family think I was right to jump at such a great opportunity.   \n\nI called my uncle and he asked him if he cared what I did with the house.  He said no, that he just wanted to give me a head start on life since he couldn't pay back my dad who paid for his university when my grandparents disowned him.  My dad passed away a long time ago and my mom and stepdad raised me. My uncle always gave me great gifts but I never knew why.  \n\nSorry if my story is disjointed.  \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
