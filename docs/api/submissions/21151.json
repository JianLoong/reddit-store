I went to a state school and did college and received good grades just not good enough grades for any of the top universities in the UK. My mother neglected me after I got kicked out of school and refused to pay for food and clothing after age 16, which led me to get a full time job on top of college which hindered my grades even more. This was because she had a very direct plan for my career, but I had no interest in that and had always planned to be an artist. Now, I am earning quite a lot of money, especially for my age, which my mother is aware of. She is now demanding money, since she \u2018wasted\u2019 her money on me (this just includes the stuff she\u2019s legally required to). I am also engaged and getting married to my boyfriend from the grammar school, which in her words is \u2018the only good thing that I\u2019ve done\u2019. She has turned the whole family against me from age 15, So i was unsure on who to invite to my wedding. I recently decided to uninvite my mum due to her demanding money and getting my family members to harass me for it, ontop of her disowning me at 18 and neglecting me from age 15. She is threatening to get my whole family to not come to the wedding if I dont reinvite her and give her money. AITA? If I am, what should I do (I will not budge on my not going university, the subjects I had studied at school wouldnt have even helped me to get a degree I wanted)", "created_utc": 1688315367, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14osix8/aita_for_refusing_to_give_money_to_my_mother_when/", "score": 608, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I have said it was wrong multiple times and said it was an asshole move, but ultimately I still had good grades, it was just the grade drop and that being on my record which made it so i couldn\u2019t go to a good uni which she didnt like, but I didnt want to go to a uni. at the time I apologised to my mum for being kicked out but I wont apologise for my disregard to education as I had always known what I wanted to do, and the stuff I was studying at 15 wouldnt help me with that. I didn\u2019t rewrite it in a crazy way I just didnt focus all the detail in why I got kicked out, as it\u2019s insignificant since my mum doesnt even care about how. Even if I didn\u2019t get kicked out she wouldve just hated me at age 17 when I wouldn\u2019t have applied to any universities, so I\u2019m ultimately glad I could blame it on the stupid reason I was kicked out of school (Stupid from my behalf, which I have said multiple times).", "If you were broke she wouldn't help you.

She didnt care about me being kicked out of the school itself, but with a term of not learning and then my employment in college years I had not received the grades needed for a university she wanted. I get it was my fault, but I was an AH teenager and was too into ***** **** to not keep the secrecy of it up.

So, I said \"no more.\" I put boundaries up (basically, treat me with kindness) with consequences (that I would call him out if he was mean).  He decided that I was evil, or mentally deranged for this. He disowned me.  Now he spends a great deal of energy telling everyone who will listen that I Cut Him Off (not the other way around), playing the victim. I am actually relieved that he is out of my life, no longer my concern. I only wish I had recognized just how toxic he was, and cut him off, myself, when I was much younger.

At 18 she disowned you, now she's begging for money and saying she's have the rest of the family refuse to come to the wedding unless you pay her, you presume with more lies as she's been lying since you were 15.\n\nLet them know those anyone who pulls out because you won't bribe your mother to not lie further isn't welcome and that she has been uninvited. Anyone who actually wants to support a family member is welcome. \n\nAlways better to get ahead of the lies with the truth because hte truth sounds like a defensive lie after someone has spread a lie everywhere. \n\nAbsolutely don't give her money, or the time of day any more. She was abusive and awful and is still being so now.", "NTA. Keep her away from your wedding, and as for any family that sides with her. Save some money on your guests list and uninvite them too.", "NTA. She *disowned* you and she thinks she still has any possible rights to an opinion much less anything else? No wedding invitation, and I would extend that to all of her flying monkeys as well. Sure as hell no money. Congrats and good lock", "NTA", "NTA!! She disowned you! And refused to care for you when you were only 16! You know what you owe her and anyone she's able to convince? A fake wedding invite. Anyone from your family who truly knows you, should know that your mother is insane and anyone with common sense would tell you that SHE DISOWNED YOU!!! You owe her nothing.", "NTA\n\nIf any family says they aren't coming because of your Mom, then they wouldn't be worth inviting in the first place.\n\nOnly have the people who have your best interests at heart there.", "Nta. I would just elope to avoid all the drama.", "NTA. If your family doesn't show up that tells you who is really on your side. You can get a cheaper wedding and have a better honeymoon.", "NTA. Add any relative who harasses you over uninviting your mother to the uninvited list, then go no contact with the lot of them and enjoy your life!", "Nta\u2026. Wedding are too much drama book a holiday somewhere romantic and get married while your there that\u2019s my opinion only thing that matters on your wedding day is that you and bf love each other", "As you mentioned your mom disown you at age 18, its time for her to stick to her words, because she cant demand money from a disowned child.\n\nAfter disowning she still demand money from you, she is not just toxic but also money greedy person, and that explains why she had a direct career plan set for you years back. I guess she wanted your career as you being her future ATM in her retirement, relying on your income.\n\nBut since you dropout, you become a dissappoint for her, and she neglect you from age 15, leading her to disown you at your age 18. She never expected you will be very well sucessfull in your life.\n\nAnd now that you earn well, and as you said she knows this, even without her career plan her failed child which she use to think, is sucessfull, now she wants ypur money, for her retirement, or maybe vacations, or IDK what else.\n\nIts time to cut bridge or she will keep harassing you till you hand your money to her. \n\nNTA", "She's doing OP a favor by helping her identify the other toxic people in the family, so she doesn't waste money having them at the wedding.", "NTA. To bad you can\u2019t elope less drama and trauma from your AH mom and her AH family.", "NTA, and legally in the UK you have to provide for your kids til they\u2019re 18, even if they move out (my 16 year old is looking to move out as soon as she can afford it, which is fine with us as we\u2019ll help her every way we can, she just wants to gain her independence, and knows that although we\u2019re not strict, the way her brain works means she takes the easiest route while she\u2019s here. We\u2019re in no way asking her to go, it\u2019s her choice). I\u2019m sorry your mum is being so toxic, but frankly, you\u2019re better off without her. If she wanted a different life, she should have chosen one- not tried to force you to live it for her", "NTA\n\nShe had responsibilities to raise, and provide for you till the age of 18 in the UK. She failed in that aspect.\n\nYou have no responsibilities to her You didn't have the choice to be born, she made that choice to have a kid. \n\nShe is not a nice mother. It's as simple as that. She's just trying to fleece you for what she can.\n\nIf the family are responding in the same ilk, then screw em. You go off, marry your partner, and stuff the family at the wedding. Invite friends over them. You're gunna be more happier overall.\n\nYou are not her puppet for her to create a future for. You're doing what you want to do, which is what you are meant to do in life.", "NTA. You owe her nothing.", "Info by top unis you mean the ancients? Or do you mean Russell group level. Because depending on your course you\u2019d have got in with b\u2019s and c\u2019s. C\u2019s and d\u2019s would have got you a glass uni place or an ex polytechnic place.

You need to set the records straight. Send email to all your family members detailing how your mother treated you. Then see how they respond; if they still take your mother's side, then they don't deserve to be your family.\n2. Your mother doesn't love you. How so? No parent kicks out their child at the age of freaking 15! Yes, your mother abandoned you. She sees you as an income source. You'd better deal with an investor than the toxic parasite.\n\nYou're incredibly strong and resilient. Please don't let yourself get trapped by lesser beings. Stay with the people who are worthy to be your family.\n\nNTA", "NTA. she made her bed, time to lie in it", "NTA keep your money for an amazing life with your futur husband :)", "NTA.  \nYour mom is Toxic, you did the right thing cutting her off.  \nNo bad thing if other toxic family members who didn't support you and believe her lies don't attend your wedding.
