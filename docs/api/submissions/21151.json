{"id": 21151, "submission_id": "14osix8", "title": "AITA for refusing to give money to my mother when I\u2019m thriving?", "selftext": "I (20F) got kicked out of grammar school at age 15 (it was a minor, and very stupid, thing from my behalf but because it was a grammar school they had strict policies). I went to a state school and did college and received good grades just not good enough grades for any of the top universities in the UK. My mother neglected me after I got kicked out of school and refused to pay for food and clothing after age 16, which led me to get a full time job on top of college which hindered my grades even more. This was because she had a very direct plan for my career, but I had no interest in that and had always planned to be an artist. Now, I am earning quite a lot of money, especially for my age, which my mother is aware of. She is now demanding money, since she \u2018wasted\u2019 her money on me (this just includes the stuff she\u2019s legally required to). I am also engaged and getting married to my boyfriend from the grammar school, which in her words is \u2018the only good thing that I\u2019ve done\u2019. She has turned the whole family against me from age 15, So i was unsure on who to invite to my wedding. I recently decided to uninvite my mum due to her demanding money and getting my family members to harass me for it, ontop of her disowning me at 18 and neglecting me from age 15. She is threatening to get my whole family to not come to the wedding if I dont reinvite her and give her money. AITA? If I am, what should I do (I will not budge on my not going university, the subjects I had studied at school wouldnt have even helped me to get a degree I wanted)", "created_utc": 1688315367, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14osix8/aita_for_refusing_to_give_money_to_my_mother_when/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You will be better off!", "NTA - Your mom sounds toxic. It sounds like she doesn't need to be in your life. And if your family agrees with her, you really don't need them around either.", "NTA\n\nIf your mother convinces the rest of your family to bail on your wedding, you're probably better off without them in your life.", "Info: you had another AITA post 4 hours ago about your family that you have since deleted. The comments looked to be saying Y T A. I find it hard to believe these two posts aren\u2019t related. Is the other post on this topic and, if so, what information causes people to call you T A?", "When the hell has having kid makes that kid an asset.. NTA and I wouldn\u2019t invite any of your family, mom included. Cut them off for good\u2026hopefully your ILs are your new family, best of luck OP", "NTA", "NTA. If she wouldn't even do her duty when you were a minor in terms of food and clothing after 16 you have no duty to give her anything.", "NTA \nShe neglectef tou and chose not to be your mom anymore since you were 15 so she definetely does not deserve any of the money that you have and you do not owe her a single dime", "NTA and invite who  you want to your wedding if none of your family come because of your mom then so be it you know who to cut off from your life with no regrets. people like your mother should never have had kids. move on with your life with the people who support and really love you and dont look back the past is the past and doesn't need to be in the future except to remind you what mistakes not to make in the future.", "NTA.  You are 4 tumultuous years older now and realize there were better ways to approach a dress code.  Uni is NOT for everyone and it shows great self awareness to realize that. Your mother expecting payment for providing what she should as a parent (and is legally required to in many countries) makes her the AH.  Then to turn your relatives against you as a form of coercion is reprehensible. Stand your ground, don\u2019t pay her anything, and explain to your relatives how your mother is extorting you for cash.", "NTA. You don't owe your mom a damned thing for raising you. She can't charge you for upkeep when you were a minor. That was her responsibility. You can invite or not invite anybody you want to your wedding. Including your mom. And if nobody shows up after you ban your mom, that tells you all you need to know. \n\nNone of them are really family if they are willing to listen to your mom's nonsense. Block your mom from your life & have a wonderful wedding :)", "NTA at all. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re mother want there for you when you grew up. You don\u2019t owe her anything. You\u2019re not the asshole for not giving her money or disinviting her from your wedding.", "I would like to include, in my mothers defence that it was a very stupid reason I got kicked out of school which could be easily avoidable, but 15 year old me didnt care for academics (and I still dont) and I wouldnt have been kicked out for that reason at any other school, I dont regret it how ever because it got me to where I am today and I wouldve wasted so much time studying for university which I wasnt planning on going to, despite my family tradition.", "Family doesn\u2019t mean blood related. Your husband will be your family. Those other people never were. It\u2019s their loss. Don\u2019t invite any of them. Enjoy your life, you have earned it.", "I posted that in the comments, It was a very stupid reason that I got kicked out of school which is why people defended my mother, but the post had been violating a rule by accident (I wrote the wrong thing) so it was taken down.", "Thats not true at all.  They had a uniform policy, you broke it, were given multiple warnings, detentions, suspensions, then finally expelled. And it wasn\u2019t just that you did it and that was it. You continued to do it. It would happen anywhere that had a uniform policy, hell it\u2019d happen the same sort of way at a workplace.  You were the asshole then, but your mother is wrong for how she treated you. Based on your writing i\u2019m going to assume you still have the same attitude toward everything which again, is AH terrotory as you dodn\u2019t learn. But the fact that you still don\u2019t think what you did was wrong, and even re submitted this after rewriting it to change the way people look at you, yes YTA. A lifelong one.", "Thanks for the clarity - considering that was 4 years ago when you were only 16, whatever it was should be something your mom needs to move past and not hold against you for the rest of your life. We all made mistakes growing up. NTA", "i rewrote it because it had violated a rule on reddit, and i rewrote it because people were only judging that alone and not the thing I had been asking for advice about. I was given isolation, and then exclusion and then expelled. I couldve avoided it by not sticking to the bit, but I was a teenager and just didnt care. I have said it was wrong multiple times and said it was an asshole move, but ultimately I still had good grades, it was just the grade drop and that being on my record which made it so i couldn\u2019t go to a good uni which she didnt like, but I didnt want to go to a uni. at the time I apologised to my mum for being kicked out but I wont apologise for my disregard to education as I had always known what I wanted to do, and the stuff I was studying at 15 wouldnt help me with that. I didn\u2019t rewrite it in a crazy way I just didnt focus all the detail in why I got kicked out, as it\u2019s insignificant since my mum doesnt even care about how. Even if I didn\u2019t get kicked out she wouldve just hated me at age 17 when I wouldn\u2019t have applied to any universities, so I\u2019m ultimately glad I could blame it on the stupid reason I was kicked out of school (Stupid from my behalf, which I have said multiple times)."]}
