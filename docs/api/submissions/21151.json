I went to a state school and did college and received good grades just not good enough grades for any of the top universities in the UK. My mother neglected me after I got kicked out of school and refused to pay for food and clothing after age 16, which led me to get a full time job on top of college which hindered my grades even more. This was because she had a very direct plan for my career, but I had no interest in that and had always planned to be an artist. Now, I am earning quite a lot of money, especially for my age, which my mother is aware of. She is now demanding money, since she \u2018wasted\u2019 her money on me (this just includes the stuff she\u2019s legally required to). I am also engaged and getting married to my boyfriend from the grammar school, which in her words is \u2018the only good thing that I\u2019ve done\u2019. She has turned the whole family against me from age 15, So i was unsure on who to invite to my wedding. I recently decided to uninvite my mum due to her demanding money and getting my family members to harass me for it, ontop of her disowning me at 18 and neglecting me from age 15. She is threatening to get my whole family to not come to the wedding if I dont reinvite her and give her money. AITA? If I am, what should I do (I will not budge on my not going university, the subjects I had studied at school wouldnt have even helped me to get a degree I wanted)", "created_utc": 1688315367, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14osix8/aita_for_refusing_to_give_money_to_my_mother_when/", "score": 300, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are 4 tumultuous years older now and realize there were better ways to approach a dress code.  Uni is NOT for everyone and it shows great self awareness to realize that. Your mother expecting payment for providing what she should as a parent (and is legally required to in many countries) makes her the AH.  Then to turn your relatives against you as a form of coercion is reprehensible. Stand your ground, don\u2019t pay her anything, and explain to your relatives how your mother is extorting you for cash.", "NTA. You don't owe your mom a damned thing for raising you.

They had a uniform policy, you broke it, were given multiple warnings, detentions, suspensions, then finally expelled. And it wasn\u2019t just that you did it and that was it. You continued to do it. It would happen anywhere that had a uniform policy, hell it\u2019d happen the same sort of way at a workplace.  You were the asshole then, but your mother is wrong for how she treated you. Based on your writing i\u2019m going to assume you still have the same attitude toward everything which again, is AH terrotory as you dodn\u2019t learn. But the fact that you still don\u2019t think what you did was wrong, and even re submitted this after rewriting it to change the way people look at you, yes YTA. A lifelong one.", "Thanks for the clarity - considering that was 4 years ago when you were only 16, whatever it was should be something your mom needs to move past and not hold against you for the rest of your life. We all made mistakes growing up. NTA", "i rewrote it because it had violated a rule on reddit, and i rewrote it because people were only judging that alone and not the thing I had been asking for advice about. I was given isolation, and then exclusion and then expelled. I couldve avoided it by not sticking to the bit, but I was a teenager and just didnt care. I have said it was wrong multiple times and said it was an asshole move, but ultimately I still had good grades, it was just the grade drop and that being on my record which made it so i couldn\u2019t go to a good uni which she didnt like, but I didnt want to go to a uni. at the time I apologised to my mum for being kicked out but I wont apologise for my disregard to education as I had always known what I wanted to do, and the stuff I was studying at 15 wouldnt help me with that. I didn\u2019t rewrite it in a crazy way I just didnt focus all the detail in why I got kicked out, as it\u2019s insignificant since my mum doesnt even care about how. Even if I didn\u2019t get kicked out she wouldve just hated me at age 17 when I wouldn\u2019t have applied to any universities, so I\u2019m ultimately glad I could blame it on the stupid reason I was kicked out of school (Stupid from my behalf, which I have said multiple times).", "If you were broke she wouldn't help you. Since you are thriving she wants to mooch off you. It's gotta be very painful and confusing, that your own mother would act like this towards the child she should have loved and protected unconditionally. Instead she seeks to exploit your resources for her own gain. You'd have no question how to treat a stranger or acquaintance who tried that. Because it's her, it's so hurtful and therefore confusing. I hope there are other people in your life who show you love and respect. Ask them for help sorting this out. Obviously the consensus is you are NTA, but you still need support and love to deal with how your family is acting.", "\u201cShe is threatening to get my whole family to not come to the wedding if I don\u2019t reinvite her ***and give her money***\u201d\n\nThat is blackmail.

NTA.", "NTA - sounds to me like you are better off her not being in your life, and not having her at your wedding.  Any family that support her in expecting you to give her money are also not worth keeping around or inviting.  Go live your life, have a wonderful wedding with people who value you for who you are not what you earn, be happy and free from the chains of choosing beggars.", "NTA.  What you do from here depends on whose life you want to live - your own or your mother's concept of your life.  If you want to live your own life, you will invite relatives you'd like to have at your wedding, which doesn't include your mother.  If they say no, they're going to miss a great time.  \n\nAs for your mother, it's important to understand that if you give her money, you'll be giving it to her forever.  It's also important to understand that if she chose to have a child, she chose to raise it which required money.  This money was her responsibility.  You don't owe anything to her.\n\nI think you should go have yourself a lovely wedding, and a great life without feeling guilty about abandoning someone who abandoned you.  Good luck.", "If your \"family\" won't come to your wedding because you won't give your money to the woman who kicked you out and abandoned you....they aren't worthy of you.

And my mother is so ungrateful for it. She\u2019s one of those parents that thinks that we owe her the world because she brought us here.\n\nI refuse to ever treat my daughters this way. I brought them here and it is my responsibility to provide for them. That does not translate into them being responsible for providing for me.

And depending on the workplace it could still get you fired. Great, you understand it was stupid but you still think of it as a lark and not your fault, no big deal, you were a kid, etc\u2026. If you were 10, i could agree. At 15 you damn well should know better and you obviously did not learn your lesson as you obviously still think that way. And it didn\u2019t get you to where you are today.  You could have easily chosen your path by not doing any of this. Take some responsibility.

Get some humility and give your head a shake.", "I wouldnt have, the behaviour policy was more strict at that school since it was a grammar school, and I wouldve had more meetings with my parents and school about it. You need to have education, so state schools will keep you pretty much no matter what. And I am self employed, So once again, me putting henna on myself (which was just the start of how I behaved, not the reason I got kicked out) isnt a problem. I think you are ignoring the fact that I still received good grades and a good education. I couldnt have easily chosen my path, as my mum disapproved of it. She didnt care about me being kicked out of the school itself, but with a term of not learning and then my employment in college years I had not received the grades needed for a university she wanted. I get it was my fault, but I was an AH teenager and was too into ***** **** to not keep the secrecy of it up. The reason I had not focused too much on why I got kicked out is because it was insignificant (yes an AH move but in the grand scheme of things literally no one in the situation cared, my mum just cared that I didnt get the grades she wanted which was hindered by me not being at school as much)", "Why do you still refuse to say the name of the movie tho?", "not going through all that just to give up the bit", "Hey do I have good news for you!  Weddings with less guests cost a lot less- congrats on the savings!  \n\nTell her you\u2019re paying off loans you took out to live at 15 and you\u2019ll get back to her in a decade.

You don't owe her money for the years she spent doing the bare minimum as a parent, and it sound like you'd be better off having nothing more to do with her.", "NTA. If your mom kicked you out at 16, you owe her NOTHING. Here in the US, it's actually illegal to kick a minor out. Supporting a child until age 18 is the VERY LEAST a parent is required to do. We bring them into this world, we have an obligation to care for them. Your mom sounds horrible. Personally, I would go no contact with her and anyone who agrees with her. Even if it's just you, your fianc\u00e9, and a few good friends at your wedding, that will be better than letting your toxic mother blackmail you and ruin things with her toxicity.", "NTA if your whole family agrees screw them. Go with your found family and move on.", "NTA.\n\nYou don't need to invite your mom, nor any of her flying monkeys. You owe your mother NOTHING, not money, nor time. She is toxic. She has shown no care for you. Why would you even want her there, or any of the people who support her?\n\nI'm 62.  It took me 59 years to realize just how mean and manipulative my father is. So, I said \"no more.\" I put boundaries up (basically, treat me with kindness) with consequences (that I would call him out if he was mean).  He decided that I was evil, or mentally deranged for this. He disowned me.  Now he spends a great deal of energy telling everyone who will listen that I Cut Him Off (not the other way around), playing the victim. I am actually relieved that he is out of my life, no longer my concern. I only wish I had recognized just how toxic he was, and cut him off, myself, when I was much younger. I often fantasize about the life I might gave had (certainly less anxiety, less depression) had I had the self knowledge and confidence to stand up for myself then.\n\nYou have this chance.  Know that you are worthy to be loved and respected, and accept nothing less from the people you accept into your life; cut all others out.  You do not need to live a life with this awful person in it. You do not need to let any of your other blood relations that treat you without love or respect into your life, either. Go no contact, block them, don't listen to their poison. Respect and love yourself. Blood means nothing; true family are the people with whom you surround yourself that love and respect you, and make you feel safe.", ">She is threatening to get my whole family to not come to the wedding if I dont reinvite her and give her money\n\nSounds like she's threatening you with a good time", "Don\u2019t invite family too, problem resolved\u2026", "I\u2019m not hearing enough from the mom\u2019s side to make a judgement.", "NTA at all.
