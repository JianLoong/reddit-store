{"id": 14833, "submission_id": "12mkroa", "title": "AITA for refusing to apologize to my fiance because our discord friends heard my voice?", "selftext": " Hi reddit, I don't use this site at all so im sorry in advance if I format things wrong. \n\n  \n  I (26 F) and my fiance (32 M) run a small discord server where I interact with customers to sell art commissions, but we also chat with customers, share stories, pet pictures, etc. There's less than 20 members and we're all on friendly terms with each other.     \nNow, I'm a very shy person, I have very low self-esteem and most of all I just like my privacy, so I don't post photos of myself online, not even selfies. Only exception is to send my fiance pictures of our pets or videos of us together, things like that. But you will never find anything related to how I look online.   \n\n  \nRecently Ive been suffering from migraines due to needing some dental surgery, and this has affected my vision and my ability to use my phone. Due to this, I slipped up and last week I accidentally posted a short 20-second video into the server and didn't notice for a few minutes. It wasn't anything risque or naughty or anything, It was of me filming a red fox cub that came to our doorstep, and I was talking gently to it so it wouldn't be afraid.   \n\n  \nAs I didn't notice right away I put the phone down and went back to work at my desk while in a voice call with my fiance, and I was surprised when my discord notifs went off and it was of one of our friends joking I did a \u201cvoice reveal\u201d and saying how gentle and friendly I sounded. After this, a couple of others found the video and made similar comments, which surprised me a lot they were so nice about it. I thanked them awkwardly but in my head I was really hoping they'd forget about it soon so I could delete the videos since as I mentioned, I'm very shy and don't want people to know me online. And I believe I said something to that effect in the voice call with my fiance. But my fiance got frustrated with me and wouldn't tell me why before insisting I shouldn't worry about it and drop it. So I did. The rest of the day went normal. (*I also admit I forgot to delete the video because after the first couple of reactions, no one talked about it again and I ended up being very busy + bad head pain until I went to bed.)*\n\n  \nFast forward to today, my partner messages me out of the blue \u201cDid you really share your voice in the server by mistake? That seems like a big slip-up for you.\u201d I was surprised, but confirmed \u201cYeah it was, I didn't realize.\u201d   he then went on saying how special my voice is to him, he wasn't happy other people heard it and said while he wasn't angry he still wants me to apologize to him for this, because apparently I reacted too casually about the slip-up when I found out, and it's hurt his feelings. I pointed out it's not something I've done on purpose, and due to my migraines this week ive accidentally texted him things I meant to post in the server, and vice versa because my eyesight has been so bad. And he continued to say it may have been an accident *but* I hadn't considered his feelings on this. I then got annoyed by this and pointed out that he never asked me how I felt about accidentally posting the video myself and asked if he had considered how it made me feel? He answered no he hadn't but continued to insist I was making him feel bad and I should still apologize. So I went into the server, scrolled until I found the video and deleted it, and said problem solved and I won't be doing it again. I won't post any videos in the future and also said I might just remove Discord from my phone entirely because I don't want to accidentally post something private.  \nHe still continued to argue I need to apologize and stated \u201ci apologize when I make mistakes that hurt you because i consider your feelings and the position it puts you in. i think you could have the same courtesy for me\u201d I pointed out that it's *my* voice, not his I posted and it's not like Id posted nudes or anything, so I don't see what I need to apologize for and refused to do so because it's bothering me how upset he's gotten from this simple mistake and how upset he's been all week about it... It's been an hour and he's still not talking to me and I do feel pretty bad for getting upset at him.
