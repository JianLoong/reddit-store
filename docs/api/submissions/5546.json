He said \u201ccan I leave it up to you?\u201d and I thought: You know what? No. I have already got her presents myself and this should be HIS gift to HER. In the past he would always do this too, at Christmas, her birthday, Mother\u2019s Day - always leaving it to the last minute and either making me go out to shops with him or completely lay all the responsibility on me. \n\nI have really had enough of this - she always gets him nice things, things that show she knows and cares about what he likes. She also takes on the responsibility of buying gifts and cards for family and friends, plus wrapping them. He has never helped or even offered. He hides behind the excuse that she\u2019s a woman so he has no idea what women like\u2026dude\u2026you\u2019ve been married to her for 22 years. There has to be more to my mother than makeup or soaps. Or you could even go to a store and ask an employee to recommend stuff. I even gave him suggestions 3 days ago such as a spa treatment facial voucher and even gave him the name of a specific place she had expressed interest in a while ago. I thought that he was going to get that and that was the end of it. \n\nBut no. Today, 3 days later on CHRISTMAS EVE he comes up to me and slaps down his card and asks if I can go online and ring them or go to the website and book it. I was gobsmacked. This man had 3 days to look this up - yes he works, but he finishes at 5pm and my mum works too so how is this an excuse? I got angry and told him I would not be doing it, this is his gift to her not mine and why hadn\u2019t he done this yet? He stared at me for a few seconds and then said \u201cWow you\u2019re really laying it on thick\u201d and walked out slamming the door. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t spoken to me since, the atmosphere is horrible in the house and I\u2019m close to tears typing this because living with a narcissist is so draining. I\u2019m not going to share my whole life story but over the years he has become worse in his verbal and emotional abuse towards me and my mum. I always seem to get it worse, probably because I stand up to him more than her. He twists things and always finds a way to make himself the victim and make me feel like the asshole. Christmas feels a bit ruined now and our family is very broken because of my dad and it\u2019s hard to try and play happy family.", "created_utc": 1671900713, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zudnkl/aita_for_calling_out_my_dad_for_making_me_choose/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good for you!", "NTA.\n\nGood for you for sticking up for your mom deserving better", "NTA\n\nThis in no way shape or form is your responsibility.

Good on you for standing up for yourself and calling out your father. He should know your mother better and make the time to buy gifts for her, especially with the helpful tips you gave him.

He, a grown man, had _one_ job, waited until the last minute, and tries to palm it off on someone else, and then get mad at the person?\n\nGood job for standing up for yourself. Narcissist parents are hell on earth, and taking a stand is hard to do. I know it isn't easy, but keep your chin up. Try to focus on having a lovely Christmas with your mom rather than thinking of your dad. This is his mess, not yours. :)", "NTA. You\u2019re Dad is the AH for many reasons (including the laying it on thick comment).\n\nI\u2019m married and I don\u2019t need anyone else to come up with gift ideas for my wife, it really ain\u2019t that hard. For the lazy husband\u2026 Replace well worn items she loves with new ones. Listen to things she says she likes and write them down in notes on your phone. I take photos if I\u2019m with my wife and she comments on something and save them in an album for ideas.

Don't allow him to keep using weaponized incompetence to get out of the basic tasks of being a supportive and caring partner to your mom.
