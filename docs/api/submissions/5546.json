She also takes on the responsibility of buying gifts and cards for family and friends, plus wrapping them. He has never helped or even offered. He hides behind the excuse that she\u2019s a woman so he has no idea what women like\u2026dude\u2026you\u2019ve been married to her for 22 years. There has to be more to my mother than makeup or soaps. Or you could even go to a store and ask an employee to recommend stuff. I even gave him suggestions 3 days ago such as a spa treatment facial voucher and even gave him the name of a specific place she had expressed interest in a while ago. I thought that he was going to get that and that was the end of it. \n\nBut no. Today, 3 days later on CHRISTMAS EVE he comes up to me and slaps down his card and asks if I can go online and ring them or go to the website and book it. I was gobsmacked. This man had 3 days to look this up - yes he works, but he finishes at 5pm and my mum works too so how is this an excuse? I got angry and told him I would not be doing it, this is his gift to her not mine and why hadn\u2019t he done this yet? He stared at me for a few seconds and then said \u201cWow you\u2019re really laying it on thick\u201d and walked out slamming the door. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t spoken to me since, the atmosphere is horrible in the house and I\u2019m close to tears typing this because living with a narcissist is so draining. I\u2019m not going to share my whole life story but over the years he has become worse in his verbal and emotional abuse towards me and my mum. I always seem to get it worse, probably because I stand up to him more than her. He twists things and always finds a way to make himself the victim and make me feel like the asshole.

Don't allow him to keep using weaponized incompetence to get out of the basic tasks of being a supportive and caring partner to your mom.

Seriously, you did more than you needed to. Your father is a grown man and perfectly capable of shopping in wide variety of forms, IRL and online.  He is pretending to be helpless because he simply does not want to buy a gift, for whatever reason.  \n\nYou\u2019re just 19 and at the beginning of your adult life so I understand why it\u2019s so hard to carry on in this toxic environment, but please, try not to let him ruin your Christmas.  He is behaving like a child, so treat him like one.  Ignore him while he having his tantrum, carryon about the house as if he\u2019s not there.

Yes when you lay it all out like that it really is pathetic isn\u2019t it?

My mom heard it and played it for my stepdad the day after her birthday and he was telling her happy birthday and she told him it was yesterday. Let's just say he NEVER forgot her birthday again.\nEdit to add : my stepdad is not a bad guy at the time he had an undiagnosed medical issue with his brain. Was just discovered a few years ago", "Oh wow \ud83d\ude44\nGlad he got shit for it. Men (I know women can be like this too but seems to be majority men) need to be put down more for being horrible with gifts.

Santa is a woman and her name is mom.", "NTA, but some people are absolutely horrible gift givers. My ex-husband was (not the reason for the divorce). He was unable to think about what he knew about me and give me something he'd think I'd like.  I don't give a crap about my nails, yet one year he was strong armed in the Mall and sold a nail care kit. I finally resigned myself to making and explicit list of what i wanted so I'd at least get something I liked. Now i will admit to beating him down over the years. He'd like to get me flowers back when he did not have 2 nickels to rub together and I'd get mad. (Hello, reason for the divorce. (Me nagging him about what I saw as inappropriate spending that kept us in debt for years.)", "NTA My mother is a narcissist, whenever I stood up to her she would twist things around and tell everyone and make me the bad guy. She would make herself into a martyr. It was awful. She could get very vengeful and violent too. She sabotaged my place at college when I was 18, I had to secretly reapply and got out at 19. It is a nightmare living with parents like this. They never change, never get better. Try to get away when you can and never look back because you can never appease them, never make them happy. Just concentrate on your own future. put them on the down low with interaction and information. Keep up with standing up to him. I found standing up worked best as they knew temper tantrums wouldn't work on me.", "im rewarding this comment becuase i never heard the term weaponized incompetence and i freaking love it!! this comment needs to be raised up.", "then that should be the new years resolution.  closing one door to open another.  you both deserve better", "Thank you!

And absolutely great.", "I think you\u2019ll enjoy the incompedance on YouTube or TikTok.", "NTA it is not your responsibility to buy his gift for your mam. He needs to put the effort in, working is not an excuse, he is just being thoughtless. It is his problem and he should have looked up your suggestion after you gave him the idea, he doesn't have to be hand held for this.", "Get your dad\u2019s card and give your mom a REALLY good gift. Or some really good gifts. Spend enough that he will never ask you to do it again.", "NTA\n\nI've had the same problem with my dad, only difference is he actually tries and talks with me about what we should get my mom now! I hope your mom leaves him and you both can get away from him!", "NTA your dad is trying to force you do something you don't want to do. I buy stocking presents for my mum on behalf of her partner (and previously my dad) becuase they suck at buying small things and they take care of the mains, which mum would tell them what she wanted anyway. But I do this becuase I was ASKED and I wanted mum to have lots of presents she would like, plus I get an extra present for doing this (I didn't know this the first time I did it). My mum is also aware of this and happy with the arrangement, they don't take credit for my work as I imagine your dad does which is wrong  it's fine to ask for ideas but not to force you and then take the credit.", "OMG this is fantastic LOL ty for posting that.", "\" 'Cause we're nothing but the devil wrapped inside a fitted sheet.\" Omg I cackled. *THANK YOU for recommending that!!\"", "You\u2019re welcome.

Please let us know how Christmas goes!", "NTA\n\nI imagine it is incredibly hard, but please keep telling yourself what you know is true: He is the asshole. Instead of feeling guilty, try to arm yourself with a disregard for the guilt he tries to lay on you. He isn't a victim; he is weaponizing your *natural care and concern about others* \\- something he hasn't got a drop of. I hope you can break out on your own soon. Good wishes.", "NTA. But, OP, tell your mom what is going on. She should try her best to handle him and take some of the focus off of you. Most moms don't want their kids to be miserable, especially around the holidays.", "Well, my girlfriend makes it hard for me haha... She will throw in a \" I like this necklace\" in november and will proceed to buy it in the start of December... This is the third year I have told her to STOP BUYING THINGS SHE LIKES IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER because I don't even have a chance this way. Still, I manage to give her something nice instead of this pathetic excuse of a human being...", "NTA.  I think you and your Mom need to have a serious conversation about how this has been working. And ask her if she really wants to spend ALL of her life with a person like this. Maybe she has been hanging in there for you to get old enough.  But it sounds like enough is enough.", "NTA you did the right thing by establishing proper boundaries for yourself and not being used, but I also buy making sure the truth was clearly seen by your mother by not participating. If you had gone along with his demand, Not only would you be telling your father that he can violate your boundaries next year, but also helping him hide from your mother that he didn't put the effort in for her.\n\nI don't think you should try and play the Happy family with him, let him be silent since it sounds like his silence is a gift for you and your mother, and you and her try to have a good Christmas with each other. You both love each other and treat each other right, the person in your household who does not is welcome not to participate since he's not part of the real family", "NTA but please make sure you get a thoughtful gift for her so she knows you care."]}
