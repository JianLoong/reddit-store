So she offered to sell it to me when she grew too old to tend to it herself. So no, other family members weren\u2019t given the opportunity to buy it but they also weren\u2019t interested in it. It is very old and out dated and my sister especially always talked about how much she hated the aesthetic of the house. The sole reason she wants to host it here is because my house has the most space.

First: I acknowlege OP isn't the AH for wanting her home and her boundaries respected. This is just common courtesy that everyone should practice. Second: Had OP agreed to host the party two things should happen: 1. OP should put her dog either outside or in a comfortable room for 3 or 4 hours until the event ended. 2: If the nephew or anyone at the party disrepects OP's home or boundaries the party should end right then and there. These are reasonable things but everyone harps on her pet being put away. Did you notice no one agreed that her home and boundaries should be respected? The only thing that mattered is everyone kissing OP's ass about the pet being put away. If you choose to be an AH and invite people over and not put your pets away, that's you. No matter what argument you make here will not change the fact that you are indeed the AH in that scenario. Putting your pet in a different area for a short period over having to make sure the pet isn't harrassed by kids, causing allergic reactions, frightening children or those with disabilites or causing a stressful situation for the pet or some of the guests seems to be an easy choice but there are some extreme pet lovers who will argue to their grave that the pet has the right to be there and cause these avoidable situations. So..OP is not the AH for wanting her home and boundaries respected but OP and ANY commentor who wouldn't just do the simple thing for a short period of time definately are the AH.

Bottom line, if you invite people over and you have a dog, the polite thing to dobis either put the dog outside or in a room that he can stay in until the event is over. It's a simple ask and only AHs would object to accomodating their guests in this manner. In regards to OP, if she had agreed to host the birthday party then invitations would be implied. She should put her dog outside or in a comfortable room until the event is over. The nephew and everyone else should respect her boundaries and respect her home and if the nephew disrepects her home or her boundaries the party should end right then. I said she wasn't the AH for wanting that but she could lose the \"it's my pets's home too\" attitude for 3 or 4 hours. Anyone else have issues with that?", "ESH.

They\u2019re guests when that subject comes up. They don\u2019t LIVE there. \ud83d\ude44", "I don't ever recall reading or hearing the phrase \"dollars to doughnuts\" before in my life.... I read it three times on reddit today!", " I think that you want to change the locks.", "Don't get me wrong, I adore my dogs and cats!  And I also would *not* tolerate the behaviour OP describes, for exactly the reasons you say.  GTFO would also be my response to such egregious behaviour toward an elderly creaky dog.\n\n\nWe go to great lengths to manage arthritis pain in our eldest dog, and I would be incensed if someone did something to make his pain worse! \n\n\nBut I think the dog's comfort isn't the biggest issue here, and is being used to distract from a ticking time bomb.", "Been teaching my kids not to touch others without permission shine they learned how to walk. It also applies to animals.", "Glad I'm not the only one side eyeing the nephew. \ud83d\udc40", "Dang, your family is awful. I feel suddenly blessed that my family sees it as the norm to stick around and clean up after a gathering!", "Same here. Hubby spends days preparing the garden/house then bam. House is wrecked and they\u2019re no where to be seen. He does it as he knows it makes me happy but he\u2019s rightfully pissed about it.", "I mean we did go from 0 to 60 here with the serial killer bit, but it is a disturbing trend that they all start out by terrorizing animals.", "The mother is the reason he acts that way", "Nah, that dude is going to be telling others not to press charges on the kid in the near future.", "I mean, is it normal to terrorize animals? Do you know of anyone who ever terrorized an animal who didn't get help and grew up to be normal? It's a pattern for a reason.\n\nI'm not one to assume the worst of a person, but I also don't think it's just a \"kids need to learn boundaries, talk to them and guide them\" kind of scenario. This is a \"get them to a professional for a psyche evaluation\" kind of scenario.\n\nAnd he's 16!!! He's gonna be an adult in 2 years! This needed to be addressed a LONG time ago.", "Considering the next comment said he was tied to a tree at the time, I think most people would agree that kid has problems above and beyond wanting to terrorize another sentient being who cannot easily get away nor defend themselves.\n\nAll of my children were kind to animals by the time they were 6, and we didn't have to teach them to do so other than \"be nice to the kitty\" or \"be nice to the doggy\" once or twice when they were 2 or 3.  Hitting another animal, especially one that cannot easily defend itself or get away, is not normal behavior for a 6 year old.", "NTA. Who tries to pick up a black lab? They're not small dogs.\n\n But it doesn't sound like the dog is the reason your nephew isn't allowed, your nephew is. If your sister keeps verbally attacking your dog, I would remind her if that fact", "Davos and Onion? I know a Thrones/ASOIAF fan when I see one", "My response exactly. Davos is not a small dog. He\u2019s on the higher end of normal at 76 pounds.", "I also have a Sandor and a Shireen, and I used to have a bearded dragon named Caraxes after Daemon Targaryens dragon lol", "Wait so he goes through your belongings as well???", "FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT! ;)", "YES. One time he went into my room (admittedly he was like 9 at the time) and found my sex toys and brought them out for everyone to see at a dinner. I should have made sure it was properly put away in the chest I usually put it in and she should have kept an eye on him but he still sniffed those fuckers out.", "LOL love that your own sister is trying to scam you. Unbelievable.", "Yes she should have because wtf was he doing in your private space?", "I don't' think there's anything malicious about it, she's just had a really bad case of \"main character syndrome\" her entire life, and looking at things from other people's point of view is just not something she comprehends.", "UGH!!!", "Right? I was thinking of a wire run to give him room to rove, but this kid needs to be put in a kennel.", "Hahahah... prolly best solution ever!", "My toddler is 2.5 and she\u2019s learned not to chase our old dog.  She still forgets occasionally but is starting to show empathy and understand when we explain that she\u2019s old and tired and she likes pets and hugs better than chasing.  16 is WAY to old for that shit to not be intentional.  \n\nTLDR I know ONE person who would chase an old dog, but she\u2019s two and a half and showing great progress.", "NTA. If the kid was 5 I'd let it pass, but a 16 year old should know by now that dogs are very sensitive creatures.", "If he was an actual child I would be so much more understanding and lenient, and I\u2019d take a much more loving approach and even consider hosting the party under a very specific set of rules for my sister. \n\nI have nieces and nephews who I absolutely adore and are allowed in my home because I can teach them how to treat animals. \n\n\nBut that teenage twerp is never coming to my house again.", "\"She\" bought the property.\n\nOP is a \"she.\"", "That is horrible and this kid has mental problems. I would've banned that family that night.", "I believe someone else quoted it \"You know what's not divided? The house, which is 100% yours.\".", ">He's not 6. He's 16.\n\nYou can teach toddlers to handle babies and small pets gently. Even 6 years is pushing it.", "Correct. I was just trying to impress upon people in this thread who think this is nbd that 16 is SIGNIFICANTLY worse and much too late to be addressing this kind of behavior. He needs therapy."]}
