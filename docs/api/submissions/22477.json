My sister asked if we could host his party here on the \u201cfamily property\u201d meaning at my house. \n\nI told her no, because my nephew is not allowed at my house. My nephew does not respect boundaries and treats everything like his plaything, including the boundaries of my older black lab, Davos. He constantly chases him around and tries to pick him up despite me telling him to constantly leave him alone. Davos has arthritis and can\u2019t be chased around and hates loud noises which my nephew is very loud.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t have any behavioral disabilities or anything he just doesn\u2019t care about other peoples wishes. \n\nMy sister blew up at me telling me I was putting a dog before my nephew and it was grandma\u2019s property that I can\u2019t dictate. I told her it was my property, I bought it and tended it and pay all the bills for it. \n\nMy mom called me and asked if I could just put Davos in a room during the party and suck it up for just a day, but I said no. This is his house and he\u2019s allowed to go wherever he wants and I won\u2019t shut him in a room. \n\n\nNow my family is divided, some of them calling me immature and selfish and others saying I\u2019m right, while some including my father refuse to get involved. \n\n\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\nEdit to add bc I\u2019ve gotten this question a couple times if the other members of the family were offered the house.\n\n My nana and I have always had a very close relationship, and I\u2019ve helped her tend the property for as long as I can remember. So she offered to sell it to me when she grew too old to tend to it herself. So no, other family members weren\u2019t given the opportunity to buy it but they also weren\u2019t interested in it. It is very old and out dated and my sister especially always talked about how much she hated the aesthetic of the house. The sole reason she wants to host it here is because my house has the most space. It\u2019s not a sentimental space for her.\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit: I am sorry people of Reddit for failing to provide dog tax.

First: I acknowlege OP isn't the AH for wanting her home and her boundaries respected. This is just common courtesy that everyone should practice. Second: Had OP agreed to host the party two things should happen: 1. OP should put her dog either outside or in a comfortable room for 3 or 4 hours until the event ended. 2: If the nephew or anyone at the party disrepects OP's home or boundaries the party should end right then and there. These are reasonable things but everyone harps on her pet being put away. Did you notice no one agreed that her home and boundaries should be respected? The only thing that mattered is everyone kissing OP's ass about the pet being put away. If you choose to be an AH and invite people over and not put your pets away, that's you. No matter what argument you make here will not change the fact that you are indeed the AH in that scenario. Putting your pet in a different area for a short period over having to make sure the pet isn't harrassed by kids, causing allergic reactions, frightening children or those with disabilites or causing a stressful situation for the pet or some of the guests seems to be an easy choice but there are some extreme pet lovers who will argue to their grave that the pet has the right to be there and cause these avoidable situations. So..OP is not the AH for wanting her home and boundaries respected but OP and ANY commentor who wouldn't just do the simple thing for a short period of time definately are the AH.

Bottom line, if you invite people over and you have a dog, the polite thing to dobis either put the dog outside or in a room that he can stay in until the event is over. It's a simple ask and only AHs would object to accomodating their guests in this manner. In regards to OP, if she had agreed to host the birthday party then invitations would be implied. She should put her dog outside or in a comfortable room until the event is over. The nephew and everyone else should respect her boundaries and respect her home and if the nephew disrepects her home or her boundaries the party should end right then.

Until he demonstrates that he can be responsible and respectful of my boundaries, he isn't allowed here.\" \n\nNTA, OP. If you want to be \\*super\\* generous, you could give a few examples of ways in which your nephew could regain your trust over time, offering a path to reconciliation and a willingness to consider hosting a future party, say, for his 18th birthday or graduation, if he makes amends and consistently demonstrates that he's learned the importance of respecting boundaries. But you're under no obligation to do so, he's violated your trust repeatedly and the onus is on him to regain it.", "There is no \"because\" here. No is a full sentence.
