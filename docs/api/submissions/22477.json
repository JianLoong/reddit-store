If the almost-16-year-old wasn't a terror, this would be a non-issue.\n\nYour sister says \"you're putting a dog over a person\" because she knows that on the surface that would sound inappropriate or imbalanced.

Kids MUCH younger than 15 can typically manage basic rules around an old or ailing pet, and it's not your fault that he cannot.  \n\n\nEdit: Oh ALSO the total assholery and entitlement of your sister expecting to be able to use your property for this party!
