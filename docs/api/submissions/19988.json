When she's mad she hates when people talk to her, and she doesn't talk much either. Normally it gets better after a couple days, but this time it's been longer than usual, and it's to the point where she doesn't sleep in the same room as my dad, and she hasn't cooked for the past few days.\n\nThis morning she was saying how I was irresponsible. She said that she was really stressed lately and couldn't cook, and as the oldest child I should have cooked for the family. I explained that I still do my chores, such as vacuuming, cleaning the bathrooms, taking out the trash, etc. She said it doesn't matter, and it was obvious that there was nothing to eat for several days. I said that it was never my task to cook in the past, because she always cooked, and everyone still found something to eat, even if it was a sandwich or something easy like frozen pizza. She said that it's not nutritious, and that we have actual food like vegetables, chicken, pasta, etc. and that I should have noticed that something was wrong and cooked for the family. I asked why she didn't expect my dad or any of my siblings (18f, 16m, 13f, 11f) to cook, and she said it's because my dad is busy with work and as the oldest child it is my duty to provide for my siblings when she and my dad are unable to. She claims that because I neglected to cook, I was irresponsible and immature.\n\nI tried to explain myself, but she didn't listen. It only aggravated her, and she went to the closet and got out a diaper, and told me to wear it. I asked why, and she told me it's because I was acting like a little kid when I should have acted like a good oldest sibling. I reiterated that I was never explicitly or implicitly told to cook, I do my share of the chores, and that any of my 4 siblings could have cooked. She then asked why I never told any of my siblings to cook, and I explained it's because all of us figured stuff out to eat. She got furious and screamed that I let everyone's health suffer, and that the vegetables and meat are going to waste. She told me I have 3 minutes to put on the diaper, or else she will never talk to anyone in the family ever again.\n\nI refused to wear the diaper, and she texted the numbers of everyone in the family announcing what happened and that she'll never talk to anyone in the family again because of my immaturity and stubbornness. My dad tried to talk to her but she ignored him. My 18 y.o. sister says that my mom was outrageous, while the 3 youngest siblings said that I might cause my parents to have a massive fight.", "created_utc": 1687107134, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cp5wa/aita_for_refusing_to_wear_a_diaper/", "score": 3212, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If no injury/tumor/strokes then she needs to seek psychiatric help. This is unhinged and I\u2019m unhinged. I\u2019m on mental health meds several. This is either head injury of some sort of some sort of mental breakdown. She needs a ER visit asap.", "Also look into seeing a physical therapist who specializes in pelvic floor. Incontinence is a common issue that they can help with!", "Menopause is really difficult for some ladies too. She could be going through that", "Yeah but I doubt you guilt them to do it or degrade them for doing it not exactly how you want it when you do ask.", "There is a huge difference. It was a few night and no one asked for OPs help.  Only went mental on her after the fact.", "Okay. If we're  blaming abuse and telling teenagers to wear dislapers on menopause,  I'm not going to argue.  I am well aware not all bodies are the same, struggle with my mental health, and am an Autist, but none of that is an excuse. This isn't a shitty attitude; it's bizarre and abusive.", "I've seen many women go through menopause without abusing their children, so let's not boil it down to that shall we?", "This comment feels like a middle aged woman who's done with her kids projecting her own emotional problems onto an abusive stranger online", "Yeah but it's her job as the mother to not be an asshole to her children, even when her kids are assholes to her. If she has been struggling that badly for that long it's her duty to find help or talk to dad about pulling more weight. Humiliating her child as a punishment is a terrible thing to do.", "I\u2019m not disagreeing that all of that could be the case, however she is still the parent and adult. It\u2019s still her responsibility to be mature and use her words and vocalize her needs. And if those needs aren\u2019t being met then she needs to do something else.", "Would doubt the 'probably' given how utterly extreme this was. Menopause tipped my mum from variably emotionally abusive into a crazy person I dreaded coming home to, and it was different to normal because it really seemed she didn't understand how irrational and extremely aggressive she was being. But 'normal' still very much included the possibility of wild abusive behaviour. It's not a 19 year olds fault he's thrown by this, it would be his dad's responsibility first if his mum has lost the plot.", "The silent treatment is usually an abuse tactic. Quite frankly, as soon as OP's mom demanded he wear a diaper or she would stop speaking to everyone, he shook have held out his hand with his pinky sticking out and said, \"Promise? Pinky swear? Don't get everyone's hopes up now.\"", "Get the fuck out of here lol.", "Then that\u2019s a failure on her part. Kids know what you teach them. If you do not set an expectation or give them direction, they\u2019re not going to magically intuit what you want.\n\nAlso, her *husband* is the one who failed here. Ultimately, he should have been ensuring his children were eating because *it\u2019s his job*.", "And now you\u2019re assuming. You don\u2019t have that kind of context lmao", "I mean, it can be both", "Lmao just stop defending the mom, there's literally no excuse for her to act like that to her son. It's wild how far some people will go to make her behavior seem acceptable", "You\u2019re jumping to so many conclusions that there\u2019s literally zero evidence for, maybe she is going through perimenopause or she could just be wretched. OP says this is a consistent problem, and there\u2019s literally nothing in this post that even vaguely alludes to the idea that the mom has been asking for help and not receiving it. I know it\u2019s easy to say \u201cman bad poor woman\u201d but you have to have at least some evidence instead of shots in the dark.", "You really need to stop defending an abuser.", "seems she may have had issues before & while perimenopause is making those symptoms worse, she needs to be removed from the household until she gets help (I know that prob won\u2019t happen). I do agree with what you said about women being dismissed because happened to me & while I was very moody, I was not abusive. I do hope she gets help for her kids\u2019 sake & OP should not be blamed for causing the parents to fight  by the younger siblings.", "Yep.  Mothers are saints don't you know.", "I\u2019ve read the book. That\u2019s not his take at all.", "That is not what the book says  at all - have you actually read it, or just 'seen' it?", "It does not say any of that lmao. It very correctly does state that the male in hetero relationships is often the abuser. Nobody in that book or in real life is saying that women do not abuse. However, due to the fact that we live in a patriarchal society, men tend to generally be abusive in some way. Yes, I'll throw in the obligatory Not All Men. Once again, that does not mean women do not abuse. It just happens that men abuse so often that it gets spoken about more, and is perceived as a larger problem. That does not mean people who were abused by women are invalid, just that it's a different discussion", "Thanks, I'll talk to my doctor. At my last appointment, the midwife said everything down there was pretty good, but you never know.", "Im sorry you\u2019ve had to deal with this issue for so long. If you\u2019re able to, definitely look into seeing a pelvic floor physical therapist. Incontinence is a common issue they can help treat.", "Right. Not all assholes are abusive, but all abusive people are assholes.", "I have tried all the things. I now take Oxybutynin 10mg twice a day. If I don\u2019t take it I\u2019ll pee myself as soon as my body says oh I need to pee\u2026there it goes. I still have leakage, but I change my pad often and change underwear and shower regularly so I just live with it. It used to be a pita, but after 31 years I\u2019m finally just like whatevs. But I do like the new poise pads. They lessened the amount of excess fabric stuff so I don\u2019t get raw during hot days so there\u2019s that lol."]}
