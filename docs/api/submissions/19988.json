When she's mad she hates when people talk to her, and she doesn't talk much either. Normally it gets better after a couple days, but this time it's been longer than usual, and it's to the point where she doesn't sleep in the same room as my dad, and she hasn't cooked for the past few days.\n\nThis morning she was saying how I was irresponsible. She said that she was really stressed lately and couldn't cook, and as the oldest child I should have cooked for the family. I explained that I still do my chores, such as vacuuming, cleaning the bathrooms, taking out the trash, etc. She said it doesn't matter, and it was obvious that there was nothing to eat for several days. I said that it was never my task to cook in the past, because she always cooked, and everyone still found something to eat, even if it was a sandwich or something easy like frozen pizza. She said that it's not nutritious, and that we have actual food like vegetables, chicken, pasta, etc. and that I should have noticed that something was wrong and cooked for the family. I asked why she didn't expect my dad or any of my siblings (18f, 16m, 13f, 11f) to cook, and she said it's because my dad is busy with work and as the oldest child it is my duty to provide for my siblings when she and my dad are unable to. She claims that because I neglected to cook, I was irresponsible and immature.\n\nI tried to explain myself, but she didn't listen. It only aggravated her, and she went to the closet and got out a diaper, and told me to wear it. I asked why, and she told me it's because I was acting like a little kid when I should have acted like a good oldest sibling. I reiterated that I was never explicitly or implicitly told to cook, I do my share of the chores, and that any of my 4 siblings could have cooked. She then asked why I never told any of my siblings to cook, and I explained it's because all of us figured stuff out to eat. She got furious and screamed that I let everyone's health suffer, and that the vegetables and meat are going to waste. She told me I have 3 minutes to put on the diaper, or else she will never talk to anyone in the family ever again.\n\nI refused to wear the diaper, and she texted the numbers of everyone in the family announcing what happened and that she'll never talk to anyone in the family again because of my immaturity and stubbornness. My dad tried to talk to her but she ignored him. My 18 y.o. sister says that my mom was outrageous, while the 3 youngest siblings said that I might cause my parents to have a massive fight.", "created_utc": 1687107134, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cp5wa/aita_for_refusing_to_wear_a_diaper/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
