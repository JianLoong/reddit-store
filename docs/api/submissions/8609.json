{"id": 8609, "submission_id": "10od8x7", "title": "AITA for not letting my step daughter take a shower?", "selftext": "My step daughter is 15. I'm 34f. My step daughter lives with us full time because she doesn't like being at her mother's house ever since her mom remarried due to there now being 4 small children running around. I have 2 sons myself but my kids don't bother her and live together peacefully so there's never been any issues here. She has the entire attic (finished) to herself and she loves the space. \n\nHer mother does not pay child support. She refuses, stating \"she chose to move out on her own doing so I'm not responsible for her financially\" and for whatever reason, my husband doesn't push it. I've told him to several times but he outright refuses, despite knowing it's costing us an extra $900+ a month and we can't afford it. The reason why it's so much extra money having her here is because she insists on taking 45 minutes to an hour and a half long showers twice a day and uses up all of our hot water. She says the scolding water is the only thing that helps her anxiety and I get that but at the same time, all the rest of us have gone without showers because she uses all the hot water multiple times and now I'm forking out hundreds more a month in hot water cost. I'm fed up. I've spoken to her father about it and he says that since it helps her anxiety, I need to leave it alone. But I refuse. I'm the one paying all the bills and have been for 6 months following my husband knee surgery and I refuse to spend this much anymore OR go without showering myself. Since he outright refuses to bring his ex to court for child support and outright refuses to speak to his daughter about costing me hundreds extra due to her excessive showering, I took matters in to my own hands. She was walking to the bathroom with all of her stuff last night after already taking an hour long shower not even 3 hours prior and I stopped her in her tracks and said she wasn't taking another shower and she wasn't showering anymore than once a day from here on out, for no more than 30 minutes maximum. She just turned and walked away. She didn't come down for dinner either. My husband went up to speak to her later and apparently she was crying saying she couldn't calm down because I wouldn't let her shower. He lost it on me and said I was purposely causing his daughter harm. I told him until he either gets child support help or until he is healed and goes back to work to pay the extra than this is how it's going to be and if they try going against it, I will be setting the hot water tank to a timer and going from there (I'm the only one with a key to the hot water heater so they can't change it). He says I'm being controlling and going to cause resentment. AITA?\n\nETA: both husband and step daughter are fully aware of the financial burden this is causing. I've spoken to them both about it within the past month alone. I have currently been needing to borrow money to even pay the water bill. Neither my husband OR her work, despite both being able to. She is of age but says she won't work because she is just a kid. My husband was cleared to go back to work 2 months ago but hasn't. Both her and her father are dead set against therapy. I've suggested it a few times.", "created_utc": 1675013616, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10od8x7/aita_for_not_letting_my_step_daughter_take_a/", "score": 789, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Taking showers 1.5 to 3 hours a day is extremely excessive and I wouldn't allow it either.  Is she getting any mental health help?  It sounds like she needs to see a doc and/or therapist if her anxiety is that bad.", "NTA: There are 5 people in the house who need/deserve hot water. Your stepdaughter and husband are ignoring the needs of your children, who don't even seem to be in the equation.\n\nThere are weighted blanket that also have heat. It might be worth looking into them for her anxiety.\n\nShe is 15. It's not okay to force her to go to work, but your husband? Yup. He's been hanging out for 2 months doing what instead of working?", "NTA. It's not like you're completely forbidding her from showering - just limiting the number of times per day and for how long. That's completely reasonable, even more so because her mother refuses to pay child support.", "NTA, your husband is the AH though, because he's not wanting to go back to work and not wanting to deal with his daughter.  She needs real therapy and her mother and father should be making her go. 3 hours of showers isn't the answer.  It sounds like you've just reached a breaking point after months of your husband not addressing the issue. \n\nYou should look at getting a tankless water heater. Then you can just set the temp low or turn it off after 30 minutes.\n\nETA: OP after reading your comments. Do you want to stay with your husband? I know reddit complains about it, but at this point it seems like a better ultimatum is she gets professional help, your husband looks for at least a part time job and possibly marriage counseling or a divorce.", "INFO: Could she just take baths instead? Surely, that would require far less water as opposed to spending up to three hours in the shower on a daily basis. That really is excessive.", "As someone who used to have severe anxiety, hugely NTA.\n\nThe way anxiety tends to work is that it makes you feel awful if you don't comply to whatever non logical idea you got stuck on your head. If you follow through you'll need to do this for longer and more and more as time passes.\n\nIf you don't cut her off, she'll end up living in that shower, thrice a day, two hours... it'll just keep growing and growing. The three of you seem uneducated on the issue so I'd recommend seeking a therapist to help her manage her anxiety rather than indulge her and worsen her situation. Not enabling the harming situation to continue is however always going to be one of the first steps of the process.", "NTA\n\nThe ex, the kid, and your DH are all using you. It won't stop until you make it.", "NTA. Your husband tho is an AH x 100. Agreed that step daughter has mental health issues.

But it's not fair to go deep into debt. How is that fair to burden you and your mental health?\n\nStep daughter is not treating/ dealing the causes of her anxiety. Showering for 2-3 hours a day might make her feel better in the moment, but it's not going to resolve anything like a good quality therapist.", "NTA\n\nFirst of all, I was alarmed by your title at first but now, having read the whole post I get it. Limiting her showers to 30 minutes maximum once per day is already incredibly generous. Growing up I got yelled at after 15 minutes to get out.\n\nSecondly, is there a tub? Can she take baths? It would allow her to soak for longer periods without using so much water.\n\nYour husband needs to step the f up and be a father and a partner, and he is not. He is causing the trouble here by not getting child support and not helping to pay the bills and not actually parenting his daughter. Daughter clearly needs some professional intervention and her father needs to step up, now.", "NTA. But I\u2019d seek out therapy for your step-daughter. She just needs help regulating her anxiety and a therapist can give her great tools to do that. It is definitely problematic that there\u2019s only one way she can calm down. \n\nAlso, has she ever tried a weighted blanket? Same all over sensory experience, physically calms my nerves down every time. But my point is - change your approach to be \u201clet\u2019s find more ways to help you\u201d so she feels she has more options, not less.\n\nEDIT to add: I specifically mean more sensory approaches, or other things that similarly help her. Because these long showers are a very REAL way to regulate her anxiety. She does not need to hear anything like be more social, be more active, stop being lazy, etc.", "NTA she obviously needs help, but she has two bio parents who are pushing that off and letting you pay the extra bills. \n\nThere are other ways to warm up to \"scalding\" like an electric blanket, hot drinks or whatever. But the **bottom line is she needs to see a therapist** and the legal (not informal) custody arrangement dictates whether she can get on your insurance.\n\nNo one is doing her any favors by letting her believe it's ok to inconvenience 4 other people and cost almost $1000 a month in utilities.", "NTA Take her to therapy. She\u2019s clearly not dealing well and needs more coping strategies. She\u2019s a minor so you can make this decision for her. \n\nCan you shower first so you have hot water, then let her use whatever is leftover in the tank?

Especially if he\u2019s allowing her to run up bills like this.", "NTA and neither is your step daughter. We all cope with things differently and she is a lot like my brother when it comes to de-stressing. He practically boils himself alive. His is related to trauma. Your SD MIGHT have something trauma related, maybe a touch of OCD, maybe something else..either way. She needs to be evaluated out of LOVE and not frustration. It sounds like her mother wrote her off, her father is an ass who doesn't want to be involved in anything difficult or that might \"rock the boat\", and you are at your wit's end (understandably so). She doesn't have a support network of adults and she needs one.\n\nYour husband is the ass here. He's happy laying up in your house, watching it burn down around you and reducing you to a walking-talking-stress bomb. Look at how he's acting. Doesn't want to parent, doesn't want to take responsibility and make his ex pay, doesn't want to go to work. What does he want? You now have an adult child on your hands. I'd tell him that it's time to go back to work or time to go live with family. Full stop. You aren't his mother. You're his partner. If he cries about his knee, that has been cleared, remind him that there are people who are fully and truly disabled (like myself) who work their asses off while living in pain that most cant imagine. If he doesn't want to go back to his old job, or can't, time to look into WFH options. He's CHOOSING to be a burden because he's been allowed to. He got used to it. Don't do yourself and your children (including SD) this disservice.", "This is an issue between you and your husband. He doesn\u2019t work, then he needs to go to court for child support.

Do that today. \n\nNTA your husband is the A H. He is not addressing issues here and they are serious.", "NTA. You need to push the issue about fighting for child support. His refusal to do that and work is absolutely 100% ridiculous.

Cut your losses.", "I think your step daughter might benefit from talking to someone about her anxieties. There is a softer approach to this that will end in the same result (her not excessively showering) and perhaps have the added benefit of improving communication and your relationship with your step daughter. \n\nNTA.", "NTA and this situation is not sustainable and is bordering on abusive toward you.", "Can she try a heating pad or heated blanket", "NTA it is reasonable to set shower time limits for people in the house to follow.

You would be better off cutting your losses and moving on.", "I do not understand all the Y T A  or E S H judgements.\n\nOP has to BORROW money to pay bills. Her husband is not working.

Your husband is being lazy and you need to give yourself a deadline of how much longer you\u2019re willing to support this family. He needs a job now, and then she can take as long of showers as she wants to.", "NTA. Your husband is TA. He needs to go back to work, take his ex to court for child support and also take his daughter to therapy if she is having such intense issues with anxiety. I think setting a timer for 15 minutes on the hot water heater is a reasonable thing to do until your husband decides to acknowledge your concerns and participate in your relationship.\n\nEdit: Also from looking at others posts, I agree it would be helpful to try and suggest some alternatives for her in the mean time. I already posted this but hot chocolate or hot tea, towel in hot water, soaking her feet in hot water.. all of these might be useful, similar solutions.", "NTA. Why are you staying in a marriage where you are treated this way?", "NTA the household can\u2019t afford her hot water habit and this coping skill is too limited.  That\u2019s it.  She needs to learn and develop a variety of different coping skills.  This is what will be good FOR HER.  A parent should want their kid to learn how to calm themselves down in ways that allow them to be successful in whatever they want to do.  Life is stressful and I\u2019m not ignoring her anxiety.  This just does not seem to be a sustainable coping mechanism for her to be an independent adult.  Your husband is an enabling AH.", "NTA- Anxiety is real certainly but taking 1.5 hour showers multiple times a day isn\u2019t a sustainable long term strategy. Insist step daughter attends counselling or an anxiety group therapy to get more heathy strategies. Showers are a bandaid solution and clearly step daughter needs more help", "NTA.

He should be providing for his child period.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is a prideful asshole for not taking his ex to court for child support.   \n\nAre your actions going to cause resentment?   Maybe, but scalding showers don't actually heal anything, they just placate for a moment.    \n\n>  Both her and her father are dead set against therapy. \n\nDoing the actual work of healing, hard as that is, is the path to take.

I can feel your frustration, and honestly your husband and bio-mom are the a-holes here. Daughter needs help for her anxiety, but insanely long showers are not it. Hell, therapy will be cheaper than this water bill. I'm sorry you're going through this, and I hope her bio-parents step the heck up and act like adults soon. Dad needs to get a damned job and get some child support. SD needs statement treatment for her anxiety.

And you're only compromising in the form of borrowing money to keep your family afloat. It sounds like the first solutions are that your husband needs to go back to work and your step daughter needs therapy. 3 hours of scalding hot water can't be good for her skin. She needs new coping mechanisms. If he can't start seeing your side, your marriage sounds like it's ok serious trouble. This is not sustainable for you.\n\nEta: and I agree he needs to go after child support, but with the time that I imagine that would take, it's probably not the short term solution to your problem.", "This kid needs to see a doctor.

You need a frank and firm discussion with your husband who overall appears to be worthless. Not working? Not taking responsibility for his daughter? This girl CLEARLY needs therapy and possibly medication for anxiety. Taking boiling showers isn\u2019t a sustainable solution to anxiety. And she is a kid. She doesn\u2019t get to refuse therapy.

I\u2019m not sure what else you would\u2019ve been expected to do here.

Finally my aunt allowed him to be evaluated, he has severe OCD and anxiety that after a good handful of years is finally getting better.\n\nYour husband is not helping his daughter by allowing this coping mechanism to go on. I also shower for anxiety, though I often take a bath now so I don\u2019t use up all the hot water. She needs therapy and possibly medication to help her deal. \n\nHer mom needs to pay child support. Full stop. Either you all come to an agreement or it goes to court, and she will probably end up paying more. \n\nSee if you can do some things as a family to help her with her anxiety, ie a craft night, spa days, mediation as a family etc. Try to see if her school has resources for her as well while you sort out how to get her expenses covered. Her parents are failing her, and she deserves better.", "Sucks that some of these comments blame the step parent. The parents need to be slapped into reality and get off their ass and help their kid. This woman is doing all that she can with what she has. My goodness! You first need legal help to save your own ass then deal with the daughter and her issues. Your husband needs to do his part and do the bare minimum.", "NTA, but this is a husband problem, not a stepdaughter problem.\n\nThe limits on showering are reasonable, and her showering is excessive enough that it's almost certainly a form of self harm. This goes extra if she's actually starting with genuinely scalding water. You wouldn't just be okay with cutting as her sole anxiety coping strategy? Or an ED? Or excessive exercise? So why should excessive showering be any different?\n\nBut, husband needs a serious kick in the rear, here. Child support from the child's mother is not optional, and is certainly not up to the mother. Therapy for a child with this severe of mental health issues is not optional. And, him working or actively participating in recovery from his surgery that has a goal of him returning to work is not optional. \n\nThe one thing i agree with stepdaughter that she should not be required to get a job to pay the excess water bill. But, that bill is her parents' responsibility, not yours. The ultimatum should be going to husband to get back to work, get back to his doctors if he's not actually ready for return to work, and/or go to his child's mother to get her to pay her share. And, frankly, his refusal to go to stepdaughter's mom to pay her share of the child's expenses plus his failure to return to work after being medically cleared strongly suggests that he also seriously needs therapy.", "NTA, everyone has a budget, and your own children have needs too. Not to mention taking thay many long hot showers daily is actually really bad for her health.Her father needs to put her in therapy for her anxiety instead of letting it drive your finances into the ground while you and your own children stink. He's enabling her and trying to make you feel bad because he doesn't want to have to face his ex wife, and actually deal with his daughters anxiety. She needs to get this under control now though too, because anxiety only gets worse as you get older. How does she expect to receive a higher education, or even hold a job if she has to be in the shower all day? I'm genuinely concerned for this child's well being. I think it's time you had a talk with her and her father and see what you can do for her anxiety that falls in your budget.", "NTA and wasting so much water really bothers me. It sounds like OP had multiple conversations before shutting down the water so I don\u2019t see how she\u2019s TAH. Her husband should be way more concerned as to why his daughter has such severe anxiety.", "NTA. That\u2019s ridiculous that she thinks she is entitled to 45+ minute shower.

You tried to compromise. You can\u2019t spend money you don\u2019t have. It would be different if you weren\u2019t footing the bill. Two showers that long a day are excessive. Maybe she could try something like a weighted blanket or space heater or a bath instead? If she isn\u2019t already in therapy I would say she definitely should get some therapy too.

Sorry you're going through this OP. \n\nI also struggle with anxiety. There are a lot of different coping mechanisms that a good counselor can teach her and a lot of good medications a doctor can prescribe. Hot showers aren't the only option here. \n\nMight also be worthwhile exploring with her and husband why she is using the showers as her go-to coping mechanism. Given that she's taking scalding hot showers, is there an element of self-harm here that she is (unhealthily) using to deal with her anxiety? She is likely also damaging her skin by taking such long, extremely hot showers. Could be a route to get husband on board with seeing a doctor and not just allowing this to continue?", "I\u2019ve read your comments and have you thought about divorce? Sucks that this teenage is taking resources from your other children (water, time in the bathroom, money) while refusing to get help. I blame the husband for expecting you to deal with it and enabling her. Not just the showers, but quitting school and having zero plans to do anything with her life. I think you should give very serious thought to wether you will allow this man to dump his kids problems on you and drag your (and your kids) life down. Maybe that\u2019s harsh, but her parents seemed to have just decided to stop parenting and expect you to deal with it.", "NTA but your husband is. He is within his rights not to push for support but in that case itsy on him to pay extra bills. \nBeggars can't be choosers, period. He is being a deadbeat and pushes you to borrow money to pay for his daughters excessive needs. She needs therapy, not water over usage. If her or her dad donty want therapy - they figure out how to get money for the bills or get the fuck out of the house", "NTA. But do help step daughter learn some other coping skills to deal with anxiety. And if husband is cleared to go back to work, why is he refusing to do so? He has essentially shifted his responsibilities to you in regard to his daughter's financial care.  He is TA for that alone. Your boundary is not unreasonable and you might consider more stringent boundaries regarding the child support issue and husband's lack of income.", "NTA. But why hasn\u2019t your husband gone back to work if he has been cleared by his doctor?", "NTA. \n\nI don\u2019t want to sound like a broken record. But you should feel empowered. Your husband is the issue here. You\u2019re paying all the bills. You are the sole provider for HIS child. He is taking the easy way out by not causing conflict with his ex to demand child support.

I'm 34f. My step daughter lives with us full time because she doesn't like being at her mother's house ever since her mom remarried due to there now being 4 small children running around. I have 2 sons myself but my kids don't bother her and live together peacefully so there's never been any issues here. She has the entire attic (finished) to herself and she loves the space. \n\nHer mother does not pay child support. She refuses, stating \"she chose to move out on her own doing so I'm not responsible for her financially\" and for whatever reason, my husband doesn't push it. I've told him to several times but he outright refuses, despite knowing it's costing us an extra $900+ a month and we can't afford it. The reason why it's so much extra money having her here is because she insists on taking 45 minutes to an hour and a half long showers twice a day and uses up all of our hot water. She says the scolding water is the only thing that helps her anxiety and I get that but at the same time, all the rest of us have gone without showers because she uses all the hot water multiple times and now I'm forking out hundreds more a month in hot water cost. I'm fed up. I've spoken to her father about it and he says that since it helps her anxiety, I need to leave it alone. But I refuse. I'm the one paying all the bills and have been for 6 months following my husband knee surgery and I refuse to spend this much anymore OR go without showering myself. Since he outright refuses to bring his ex to court for child support and outright refuses to speak to his daughter about costing me hundreds extra due to her excessive showering, I took matters in to my own hands. She was walking to the bathroom with all of her stuff last night after already taking an hour long shower not even 3 hours prior and I stopped her in her tracks and said she wasn't taking another shower and she wasn't showering anymore than once a day from here on out, for no more than 30 minutes maximum. She just turned and walked away. She didn't come down for dinner either. My husband went up to speak to her later and apparently she was crying saying she couldn't calm down because I wouldn't let her shower. He lost it on me and said I was purposely causing his daughter harm. I told him until he either gets child support help or until he is healed and goes back to work to pay the extra than this is how it's going to be and if they try going against it, I will be setting the hot water tank to a timer and going from there (I'm the only one with a key to the hot water heater so they can't change it). He says I'm being controlling and going to cause resentment. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But there is absolutely no reason they need to be as long as they are for her. I get the sensory aspect. It's the same for me, too. But I will say as someone with training and experience in this area, from a neurophysiological standpoint, the maximal benefit is only gonna be for the first 15 mins, anyway. After that your body habituates, the same way your wrist does to a watch, your face does to glasses, or your body to covers in bed. So objectively speaking, a 3-hour shower isn't doing anything for her anxiety or state of arousal that a 15 minute shower wouldn't already be doing.\n\nI believe that from a comfort and almost compulsion standpoint, this has become habit and routine if not a compulsion, and being forced to break from that routine is probably really distressing and absolutely feeds into the anxiety. But the very best thing that you can help her do is go to therapy and learn additional coping skills. Optimally, she would go see an occupational therapist with dedicated mental health and sensory processing experience. They will probably be the most helpful in working with her to identify sensory experiences that provide similar sensations and soothing but which are more sustainable and even versatile alternatives, and honestly it'll probably be a better use of your step-daughter's time than a psychotherapist and/or primarily talk therapy.\n\nShowers should absolutely not be anyone's sole coping skill, much less 3 hour-long showers, and the comments saying YTA are either unrealistic and way out of touch, ridiculously wealthy, live under a rock and aren't aware of water shortages literally everywhere or experiencing them themselves, have never paid their own bills, or all of the above.

That\u2019s like a second mortgage payment. \n\nA 15 year old should be mature enough to hear that she can\u2019t burden the household financially. I\u2019m not suggesting the daughter work (it is hard to find jobs at 15) *but* then she needs to be reasonable. If she can\u2019t be reasonable due to medical reasons (anxiety) she needs *medical intervention* which husband isn\u2019t willing to get her. \n\nSo we\u2019re back at owing a second mortgage payment, borrowing money, and it somehow being OP\u2019s fault!?\nThis is an enormous shit show and OP should, imo, leave.

OPs husband has no income atm and doesn't bother to get child support. Stepdaughter could work but doesn't want to. On top of that him and his daughter are against therapy so she refuses to get actual treatment for her anxiety.\n\nWhat is OP supposed to do? Footing the bill until they lose their home? Risking her sons wellbeing? Be serious. \nIf her stepdaughter refuses to get help OP has no other choice until her husband decides to actually care for his child", "You're  being ridiculous, how is telling her no more than one shower a day a threat or an ultimatum, no one should shower more than once a day especially if you're not paying the bills. Op's being extremely reasonable considering she's the one who has to pay for this. \nSo what she should just suck it up and keep paying expensive bills because the dad and the actual mother don't know how to parent their child? THEY should step up and try to find better ways for their child to deal with her anxiety rather than having her waste water and Op's money. \nChild support is the better option if the husband doesn't want to help fix this whole ordeal.\nAlso as someone who also has to deal with bad anxiety she's just acting spoiled, 15 is old enough to understand the cost of money and she's like that because her parents refuse to step up and teach her better.", "You need to get out of this situation and protect yourself. Even if you don\u2019t separate permanently, you need to remove yourself until something changes. This is incredibly toxic. I feel so bad for the daughter, she\u2019s clearly struggling mightily\u2014 but she is a minor and it should not be completely up to her whether she gets help in this case. She\u2019s clearly not functioning, and so her father should be stepping in to get her help, period. He should be insisting that she sees a therapist, non-negotiable. If he wants to enable her instead, you have to stop literally setting yourself on fire (with hot water bills!) to keep her warm.

No 15-year-old would form such strong opinions against counselling or use the word \"quack\" to describe a therapist on her own. \n\nIt's time to sit down with your husband and have another conversation about this. Continuing to discourage his daughter from getting help is doing her no favors.", "Huh .. perhaps your husband should ask her doctor for a thyroid test.\n\nSoaking up heat like that might be because she feels cold alot, that and the feeling tired/sad are thyroid dysfunction symptoms.

They treat her as a bank.\n\nCurrently I'm unemployed, cuz my contract ended and wasn't extended end of December. I did take January time off, no applications whatsoever, cuz I had no proper time off in a long ass time. Just rested up, but tomorrow I'll be applying full force now. I get it, not working can be nice, but when you're living in a household with multiple people, where it's also your responsibility to pay up... You gotta make it work.\n\nDefinitely they think of poor OP as a bank. I get mental health sucks, I'm multitude of issues too (not anxiety, but I can suffer from anxiety episodes), but there are healthy AND unhealthy coping mechanisms. When a coping mechanism affects another person so much that they go into debt, it's unhealthy and gross.\n\nOP really nees to set expectations and boundaries and if they're not upheld, stop paying the water bill and threaten with divorce honestly.

This is a series of enormous red flags that your husband is in denial about.", "With the information you provided I immediately wondered if the mom\u2019s new husband molested her. The need to shower obsessively and drastic change in character and school. \nIs there a way to broach the topic or ask how you can support her?", "Unfortunately therapy doesn\u2019t work if the person in need of therapy doesn\u2019t see the need/refuses to participate.", "I (F32) struggled a lot with anxiety and then depression, first in my teens and then more so in my 20s. It has taken until my 30s now to work my way back to healthy and functional and I still constantly feel like I'm years behind where I should be. I'm sorry your step daughter is struggling and that she and her father are so resistant to therapy/working on alternative coping measures.\n\nYour comment here spoke to me because when mental health struggles held me back, a lot of it ended up centered around feeling like I was failing after having had so many advantages. I was smart, super successful in school, and had a lot of support pursuing what I was passionate about. I was in a special program in high school, got college credits before graduating, got scholarships. etc.\n\nBut all that said, when I struggled I don't think people in my life knew how to help. I just felt like I was failing when I shouldn't have been, and blamed myself even more. It took years and years to work through that sense of failure. I \"wasted\" time at a job that didn't lead anywhere and took advantage of my hard work and it was 6 years later before I had healed enough to make a leap, go back to school, and shuffle over to a related career field. Then another 4 before I've started to feel like I'm settled and catching up.\n\nAs someone who has been in a similar position, I'll say this:\n\nYour stepdaughter needs your support and understanding, as well as compassion. But she also needs people like you to step in and put their foot down when they see something unhealthy that is going too far. I can't speak to your exact approach at that moment - I hope you are able to follow it up with a compassionate conversation. She needs to find other coping mechanisms AND ways of working through whatever she is dealing with. If she and her father aren't open to therapy that is okay. Ultimately, therapy and meds didn't help me too much either, they were stepping stones for work I had to do myself. I wouldn't discount them entirely, but they aren't a solution by themselves either.\n\nMy biggest recommendation for your stepdaughter would be to start engaging in activities or with people doing activies she's interested in... maybe not even the ones she used to be so engaged in. Exposure to greater variety of things helps, especially when it's less directly related to things that might be a source oheads pace. And greater variety of people doing other things.\n\nAnd whatever you do, try not to pile onto that building anxiety. It sounds like her mom remarrying was a trigger, but like there is much more going on. Being engaged and supportive of the difficulty of just trying to find a way forward is probably your best bet. People with anxiety know what's in their way, and are often aware that they are exaggerating the degree of challenges they face. It's just incredibly difficult/impossible to work your way around those things when that's your headspace. Breaking patterns is difficult but hugely helpful. You have to basically rewire how you think. Develop new coping mechanisms and then new habits and slowly build. It takes years and sometimes you have to pick up bad habits to break worse ones and then fix those later.\n\nIf you're interested, maybe seek professional help yourself so you can discuss how to best help your husband and stepdaughter.\n\nWishing you and your family compassion and support!", "This is majorly concerning and you\u2019re not TA at all. If she refuses therapy she at least needs another healthy coping skill. Has she tried dipping her face/body in ice water?", "OP, if I'm off base here, I'm sorry. Your stepdaughter has a new anxiety. She likes to shower, which might mean she feels unclean. She wants to hide away from the world....\n\nIs it possible that she has been molested or harmed in some other way over at her mother's house? Not necessarily by her stepfather. He probably has a lot of friends and family that are new in your stepdaughter's life. But the suddenness of this change in her and her outright refusal to be \"reasonable\" about showers.\n\nPlease, if you can, find a way to find out that doesn't cause even more damage. \n\nMy husband and I have been raising 7 grandkids for 10 years now. We've had to deal with this, so I might be biased. Since I stuck my nose in, feel free to dm me if you have questions.", "She\u2019s 15.

He could be getting child support or working from home, or even working on site somewhere (6 months is a long recovery window from knee surgery), but instead he is leaving you to support him and his child.

I feel terrible for the situation you have found yourself in.", "Does your husband explain his reasoning for backing her up?

Using your child support money that is suppose to be for them and using it on your husband and his daughter.

He's being a bum, but you're not exactly being the world's #1 Wife(tm) by constantly throwing it in his face.", "I was wondering the same initially but step daughter insists that her step dad is great and it's the small children she can't stand. I think they are between ages 4 and 6. Two sets of twins.", "Don't make assumptions. My children's child support money is split between their food cost and then the rest goes in to their college fund. I suggest asking for info before putting your foot in your mouth. It can save you a load of embarrassment.", "How does that make her the AH, if her husband is a bum?  She\u2019s supporting the family financially now.  He\u2019s doing nothing.", "Might not have been stepdad. She needs expert attention. Something happened.", "Sounds like she may have been sexually assaulted but hasn\u2019t told anyone. It could be a peer, a teacher, a family friend, or someone else in her life, but for such a dramatic shift in character it has to be some type of trauma.   \nThe excessive showering and the fact she is no longer insterested in school of the future are concerning. This also may be why she doesn\u2019t want therapy, because she wants to forget what happened. \n\nYou need to have a come to Jesus talk with your husband. He\u2019s unemployed, not pursuing child support and draining your bank account. He needs to get a job or move out. He\u2019s doing his daughter a disservice by not trying to figure out what happened to her. It will only get worse without help.", "Does she maybe feel like she no longer gets attention from her mother and stepfather? This behavior seems hugely attention-seeking. And I mean that in a real clinical way, like an unconscious cry-for-help-way, not like a teenager looking for someone to praise her way. Did she go from only child to being ignored? \n\nThe issues obviously started in the other home and are spiraling. If she went from free-ride-to-college with goals, to potentially dropping out and just staying at your house indefinitely, something major has affected her. \n\nI\u2019d look twice at the new step-father, though obviously don\u2019t falsely accuse him or anything. But long showers and not feeling clean, plus shutting down completely is not uncommon after sexual assault.", "Did you ask her directly if he did anything, or did she automatically just say he was great and wanted to leave because of his kids?", "This is so real. The signs are very clear. OP you at minimum need to set a boundary about couples counseling to get you and your husband on the same page."]}
