It would be amazing to have enough money to treat everybody all the time, but that is not your (or most people's) situation.  Treat when you want to and don't treat if you don't.  I would slack off the treating others and not worry about it.  Nobody I know expects it.", "I\u2019m on the fence here. I also like to treat my friends occasionally but you have to draw a boundary.\nYou complaining out loud about being hungry and then internally being annoyed is not fair to your friends. You need to communicate expectations. So when I treat my friends for food, I\u2019ll say, I can buy this time but we gotta split the bill next time so they know what I need to avoid feeling bitter with my friends. \n\nDon\u2019t feel hurt when someone isn\u2019t getting a hint. Friends are not reading your mind\u2026 be open and communicate. I get it cuz I love to treat my friends so time but I\u2019m in between careers at the moment so I had to dial it back. Get logical and emotional you on the same page and don\u2019t let your bitterness build up, but also don\u2019t let your friends walk all over you. Be sure your friendships go two ways with some give and take (maybe your give is money but someone else\u2019s give is non money)", "NTA. But now you know that sometimes people will hang out with you if you pay for their food and drinks, but they might not be friends, nor will they do the same for you.", "INFO: Do your friends treat you after you treat them? Or are you the only one doing the treating? \nYou can\u2019t expect people to help you because you\u2019ve chosen to spend the very small amount of money you have on treating friends, but I think it\u2019s also important you don\u2019t set the precedent that you\u2019re always going to be the one to pay in the first place.", "You don't owe your friends giving them lavish gifts and the like.\n\nNTA", "Are you TA for....what? Spending $ on your friends and running low, expecting them to spend money on you, being sad that their response was not to lend you $?", "INFO:\n\nDo your friends always *ASK* you to treat them?\n\nWhile I understand that you appear to be a generous person, you aren't being fiscally responsible by continuing to pay for others when you just don't have it to give.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is enjoyable for everybody, you like to treat them and they like being treated! \n\nBut if you feel that by treating your friends you're making more of an effort, think about the dynamics in your friendships, how do they show you that you're their friend? maybe they find value doing different things, like having a good conversation for example.\n\nIt is easier to find more value when you buy, or give a gift to someone because the value is innately fixed on the object you spent money on, but that doesn't mean you can't find this valuable gratitude on other things!\n\nYou should talk to your friends about this, even if it's a tough a conversation. And if you're short on money and need to spend money on yourself instead of your friends, you should do it! don't feel guilty, and your friends will understand that you can't always treat them.", "Your friends think you have lots of money, because you are always spending it on everyone.", "NTA but are you sure that they are friends and not people hanging out with you because you treat.
