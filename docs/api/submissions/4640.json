He commutes to a university that's about 35 minutes from our home on a very busy highway in the mornings and afternoons, so I want to make sure he's really got it. \n\nAfter this winter break, he'll be starting his spring semester of his sophomore year. For the past year and half (since his freshman year), I've been riding shotgun while he drives us up to his school, I drive back home alone, I come back to pick him up when his classes are done, and he drives both of us back home. My wife tags along too. \n\nMy daughter (25F) recently moved out a few months ago, when he started his sophomore year. Meaning, she has seen us drive back and forth with him for his entire freshman year and didn't say a peep. In fact, we did the same with her when she was in her freshman year too, so she knows our protocol.\n\nBut for some reason, when we talked on the phone last week, she was shocked to know we were still driving him in his fall semester of his sophomore year, and said we need to \"let go and let him do it by himself.\" Which, of course, we want to, and my son is getting better every day. We just want to make sure he's fully comfortable, confident and knows how to handle the road by himself.

Good Lord ! LET GO.", "YTA. He's got a license, and he's not a kid anymore. This is ridiculous to the point of being creepy.", "YTA\n\nDo you also still cut up the meat on his plate?\n\nLet him go. He passed his drivers test, has his license, that means the State believes he is competent enough to operate a vehicle on the road safely.\n\nIf he was 16, Id say 'ok, you are making sure he's safe' but at 20, after 2 years experience driving and the school being so close, you definitely have control issues.", "The more I read the more SMH I am. I think this dad is just delusional. The comment of he's a safe driver but dad still doesn't want him driving on his own. He has no friends, hmm, wonder why. And the last one I read \"He has his head on straight so I don't think there's a girl [he's involved with]\" and it's not cuz daddy has to drive him around? So you mean he's gay or asexual? I mean a 20 yo boy not interested in girls, those seem to be the other options.", "YTA. What, exactly, would he have to do to show you that \u201che\u2019s really got it\u201d? He\u2019s an adult who has been driving for almost 2 years, and has been driving that particular route for 3 semesters. Unless you are leaving out some significant information, you are far into helicopter parent territory.", "YTA. Cut the apron strings.", "YTA. Do you wipe his butt for him too to make sure \u201che\u2019s really got it?\u201d", "YTA. Not sure if this is an older generational thing but it's not...normal. Your son is an adult. Stop it.", "YTA - holy shit he\u2019s a freaking adult but the damn cord!! How unbelievably embarrassing for him!", "YTA. By your own comments, you son has no friends, does almost nothing social and seems to have almost no life of his own whatsoever. This would be a problem from a much younger person, but for a parent to still be inhibiting the developmental wellbeing of their grown, adult child is unconscionable to me.", "YTA. Your son is an adult and should be driving himself to college without you in the car. You had the entire time he had his permit to make sure he was ready to drive on busy roads and in dangerous situations, and yet you think it\u2019s a good idea to continue to do so. Let go of the ropes your desperately holding on to. And exactly how busy is the busy highway?", "Info - what if son has plans?", "YTA. Over a year and a half of supervising for \"his safety\" after he already had learned how to drive? If he hasn't had an accident yet, maybe you need to learn to trust your kid.\n\nIf you were driving with him because you needed the car all day, it would be a different story. But let him grow up before he decides to be push you away for good.", "YTA\n\nI'm almost afraid to ask, but are you also \"coaching him\" in his own car, or is he still not old enough at 20 for a big boy vehicle of his own?\n\n\nAlso, driving is a solo activity.\n\nWhat exactly do you think you're going to do if something *did* go wrong? \n\nGrab the wheel? Stomp on the brake from the passenger seat? Just freak out and never let him drive again?\n\nAs someone who got her license at 16 and navigated winter driving and road trips alone within the first six months, I cannot even fathom why you'd think this is appropriate.", "INFO. Do you helicopter your son by his choice, or yours? If this is you saying \"I am going to ride with you\", then it might be time to start letting your little birdie learn to fly on his own. Why continue to ride with him? He is an adult now. If he is not driving up to your standards, are your standards too strict? \n\nIf HE said \"ay yo Pop, I dunno about this driving thing, can you ride shotgun and make sure I do ok?\", then no, you are NTA. I suspect, though, this is your choice...", "I say this out of a position of love and understanding: **YOU ARE THE ASSHOLE**. You\u2019re at risk of losing your son completely, and you realistically don\u2019t have a ton of time to save the relationship. \n\nSpeaking from experience as someone in your son\u2019s position, you are doing him such a massive disservice. I get that college is expensive, and there\u2019s no problem with commuting; but unless you only have one car and are carpooling this should absolutely not be happening. \n\nYour son has driven the same route, back and forth, for a year and a half now. Leased car or not, so long as he isn\u2019t an erratic driver when you\u2019re not in the car, he will be fine. No need to be supervising him \u201cfor his safety\u201d. \n\nYou also mention that you wanted to be with him to prepare him for things that might happen, but you\u2019ve done the opposite. Your son likely can\u2019t solve problems without you doing them because you\u2019ve never given him the opportunity to fail. He likely has no idea what to do on his own, and as a sophomore in college, the time for him to \u201cbe an adult\u201d is, honestly already passed you all by. He\u2019s 20 years old. Do you handle his social drama for him? Do you reach out to his professors when they get bad grades?\n\nIf you don\u2019t read any of the above, read this. Your son is most likely seething on the inside that he\u2019s 20 years old and can\u2019t even drive 35 minutes to school by himself. The minute you let him go, at best he\u2019ll go no-contact with you; at worst he\u2019ll go crazy and do something stupid. **That doesn\u2019t mean you should hold him in.** I know this because I myself was sheltered through high school and went absolutely crazy in college by purposely applying to schools where I know my parents would never be able to control me. It took me a long time to get to a good spot, and I learn how to fail in many high-stress situations as opposed to the low-stress situations my parents sheltered me from. \n\nThe single best thing you can do for him is to apologize and let him out on his own. He still has a couple years left, he might be able to salvage his own independence and turn into the happy and healthy adult that you probably assume he will be. But until you let him go, he will never do so because **you never let him learn how.**", "Yta. Let go for gods sake and let your adult son live without you helicoptering over him.", "YTA he\u2019s a sophomore in college bro. Not high school. Yeesh", "So he has been driving that route for over a year and you don\u2019t think he has figured it out yet. At some point you have to stop hovering and let them go. Your daughter is right.

If he still an unsafe driver then he shouldn't be driving at all.", "YTA\n\nWhen is he good enough? In a month, a year? You have put off giving him this independence for some weird reason, but you need to recognize him driving to school by himself is long overdue.\n\n I would suggest he get an apartment close to campus so he can really start adulting. What you are currently doing is not encouraging him to become a fully fledged adult. You need to get him out of the nest or you will be back in 10 years saying \"Why won't my son move out of my house and be independent?\"", "I\u2019m going to go with YTA. \n\nThe only way this could be a no AH here situation would be if your son asked for you to come ride with him.", "YTA for helicopter parenting.

He\u2019s almost 40 and hasn\u2019t moved out of the house yet. Likely never will", "I\u2019m adding a comment because I am seriously concerned for your children and yourself. You seem to have overwhelming anxiety. Your partner is either the same or an enabler. Your anxiety is not showing in forms of love it is showing in forms of control. You would rather waste thousands of dollars in gas going back and forth than allow your son, who you claim to be very smart with a good head on his shoulders, to prove to you and himself that he can do something as simple as make a 35 minute drive alone. You cannot control other drivers whether you are in the car with him or not. You cannot control if a meteor smashes him randomly or if a cut on his toe does him in! You can only control yourself and right now you are not. Your son doesn\u2019t  have friends he hangs out with after class, schedules after class activities around when his parents can pick him up, doesn\u2019t even go out on the weekends often\u2026 that should be a hint to you that he is not living his most independent life. If this were his choice it would be one thing but it seems this is instead his horrible reality of being raised by someone so selfish they would rather imped on their ADULT children\u2019s life than take some time to work on themself and their need for control and struggle with anxiety. YTA massively.", "YTA - After reading through the comments you seriously sound like an overly paranoid control freak of a parent. Driving is always dangerous; it doesn't magically get less dangerous with you and/or your wife in the car. Let your son actually grow up and do things on his own. You already admitted that he's not a bad driver and this whole situation is you and your wife's choice. \n\nAs far as your son not making any plans or making friends goes, have you ever stopped to consider that he puts no effort into it because of what you are doing? Imagine a situation where he gets invited out, and he has to respond with \"I have to leave by x:xx time so my dad can pick me up.\" \n\nYou at an absolute minimum owe it to your son to ask him how he feels about the situation. If he REALLY doesn't care, then fine. But if he wants you to stop, then stop.", "INFO: Do you and/or your wife need the car during the day? I mean, of it's your car and it can't be sitting in a parking lot all day, I absolutely understand. My kid would rather get a ride than use public transportation. \n\nIf not, well...you're kinda an AH.", "Info is there a specific reason you don\u2019t feel he\u2019s ready to drive on his own?", "This is one of the worst cases of helicopter parenting, I\u2019ve read in a while. He\u2019s about to be 20, in his second year of college\u2026you\u2019re not doing him any favors. \n\nFrom the comments, it seems as if, you & your wife\u2019s behaviors is from your own fear and anxiety. You already stated your son is smart and he\u2019s not a bad driver. Again, not doing him any favors entering into an independent and adult lifestyle.", "What does your son say?  Further, does he have a history of wrecking cars?\n\nI wouldn't go so far as to say AH.  But, if your son tells you he can do it, then back off.  At 20 years old, he should be able to handle a 35 minute drive.", "YTA. You\u2019ve been doing this for over a year? I think he\u2019s ready and you need to let of the reins a bit. You are being a helicopter parent.", "YTA do you have a child or a prisoner.

What have you been doing? YTA. If you haven\u2019t taught him how to be an adult by now it\u2019s time to stop. You\u2019re doing this weird controlling bullshit for you, not for him. What do you think about all the other grown ass men who handle their own grown up lives? Aren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself for not preparing them?", "YTA. You\u2019re doing wrong by your son. You should be encouraging him to explore the world and meet new people. By not letting him drive himself, you\u2019re holding him back. There is so much freedom in driving, so much opportunity. \n\nI think you love your son but you need to let him grow up. It\u2019s scary not knowing everything that is happening. I know that I worry about my own son whenever he goes out. That\u2019s part of being a parent. I don\u2019t think that worry every stops but we suck it up and deal with it. Encourage him to drive himself.", "YTA my son is 20 and a sophomore in college. I can\u2019t imagine controlling his life like you are controlling your son. Do you let him get into cars with other people his age or do you insist on driving him around? No wonder he doesn\u2019t have friends. You are seriously preventing him from having a life and you should be ashamed of yourself", "Holy shit. When I was 15 I got my learners permit and at 16 my full drivers license. I used to drive on icy winter roads in WI to school and my job. Seriously?", "At no point did you tall about whether he had a license to drive on his own. If the governed issued him a license that says he can drive in his own then YTA because you're being controlling. If he can't drive without a licensed driver in the passenger seat, then N T A, but I'm guessing that's not the case, or you would have said so.", "INFO: what does your son want? Does he want to drive alone or is he comfortable with the arrangement?", "YTA. He got his license almost two years ago yet you and your wife insist on coming with him. You're refusing to let him be independent. You won't let him grow up. Stop being so controlling. He's an adult now. What are you going to do, keep driving with him until he graduates? Until he gets married? Jeez.", "The more I read your comments the more I'm sure you don't want other peoples opinion. Everybody is telling you to let your son have some independence, you just tell them he is ok like this....says who? You?\r  \nListen, he doens't say anything because he is used to have his parents controling every aspect of his life...but be aware he is not happy with this arengement, he may even deny if you ask him about it in fear of the consequences...so, just let him go already. No 20 yo have no friends...I would dye in shame if my parents drove me to college, thank gods they let me take the bus or drive myself (even though I wasn't a perfect driver).\r  \nYou cannot control if an accident will happen or not, you may get in an accident yourself while driving back.\n\nSo here is some practical option:\r  \nLet him drive alone once a week. Increase the number of times a week he drive alone until you just don't have to drive him anymore. Maybe one-two months is enought time to be done driving him.\n\nHope you listen to the people of internet, we really are trying to help you have a healthy relationship with your son!", "yeesh. cut the freaking cord already. \n\nYTA", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu are toxic Ahs and shitty parents.

You are crippling your son. He has no friends, no social life outside of you and your wife. He\u2019s not interested in girls because you haven\u2019t allowed him the opportunity to learn how to interact with them since you\u2019re always around! If I was a girl at his school I\u2019d run in the opposite direction because nobody wants to date someone with helicopter parents. \n\nAs a sophomore in school it\u2019s horribly sad that he doesn\u2019t even have his class mates phone numbers. This 100% rests on you and your wife\u2019s extreme codependence on him, stunting his social growth. You should honestly be ashamed at what you\u2019re doing.

For the past year and half (since his freshman year), I've been riding shotgun while he drives us up to his school, I drive back home alone, I come back to pick him up when his classes are done, and he drives both of us back home. My wife tags along too. \n\nMy daughter (25F) recently moved out a few months ago, when he started his sophomore year. Meaning, she has seen us drive back and forth with him for his entire freshman year and didn't say a peep. In fact, we did the same with her when she was in her freshman year too, so she knows our protocol.\n\nBut for some reason, when we talked on the phone last week, she was shocked to know we were still driving him in his fall semester of his sophomore year, and said we need to \"let go and let him do it by himself.\" Which, of course, we want to, and my son is getting better every day.

Is this the only time in the day you guys get as a family because of his schedule? sounds like he's not fighting you on it but if he's still that uncomfortable then he shouldn't be on the road, period. Otherwise, it sounds co-dependent and if you're not teaching him skills you're just making him feel like he's not ready to be on his own or can't do it. It's telling that even your daughter is surprised considering she was subjected to the same routine.", "Ha. And my dad taught me to drive in Canadian winter ... I would ask if I could stop on time and he would go. Best find out.    A wee bit of an asshole. I get the fear but that's a lot of monitoring that might not be needed", "Why would you want to spend 140 minutes in a car multiple days a week?

Also exceedingly common is ADHD and anxiety, and you don't want someone who medically cannot focus behind the wheel of they're not extremely well prepared. We downplay the danger a lot because of a deeply ingrained Car Culture, but it would be a shame if that inexperienced driver died about it.
