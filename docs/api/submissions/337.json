I won't go into detail but because of what happened, I've been in and out of therapy for 3 years now. Recently, about 3 or 4 months ago, I got a new therapist (we'll call her Melissa) and she is really sweet and kind.\n\nThe problem is I have a very hard time opening to people due to them leaving or dying. An example of this is I had a theater teacher I loved to death my sophomore and Junior year, I'm a senior now, I told her a lot of things and even brought up why I had so many panic attacks during the musical for that year. That was because of trauma. This happened after I got Melissa but she had to leave due to my school treating her like shit and family issues so she moved and I may not see her again...ever probably.\n\nAnother example is I opened up to another therapist, before Melissa, about a year ago and was starting to get into the trauma when she vanished off the face of earth without warning and I was left alone thinking I was bad luck and it was all my fault.\n\nSo my mom has been pushing me to open up about the trauma like I do with my bf, he kinda knows the situation but not all of it he does know though I'm scared of my ex coming back and manipulating himself into my life again like he's been trying to do before. She's getting mad because in therapy I'm freezing and shutting down when we try to talk, it's a telephone call due to Melissa being in another part of my state and it being a long drive. My moms been with me in therapy because I'm not ready to open up or be alone and need some support until I can get myself to actually talk about the trauma.\n\nBut lately she's been giving remarks like \"I wish you had talked more\" one day when everything was so overwhelming I couldn't cope or talk much, or \"I can't do all the talking and you do some\" because I have a hard time trusting Melissa. She's nice but it's hard to believe her when she says she isn't going to leave.

Honey, this is way above AITA. What I will tell you is, I\u2019m in mid50s, have been through multiple therapists for C-PTSD over the years. What I\u2019ve learned is only **you** can tell when you are ready to be that open and vulnerable to another person. Melissa is a professional, trust that she understands that you need to take your time. Try not to worry about what your mom says. Your journey to mental health is not hers. Whatever she says probably comes from a place of love, this doesn\u2019t mean she can dictate how fast you progress.\n\nSending big virtual hugz.", "NTA.  It would be a good idea to talk to your therapist more about your fear of opening up.  It kind of sounds like your mom is doing more harm than good at this point, although I assume she means well.", "NTA\n\nDoes your mom think she's the therapist? What makes her the expert on when and how to open up? I'm sure Melissa has a degree hanging on her wall. What wall has your mom's degree hanging on it? Let the professional therapists do the therapy, and if there's really a problem, then the professional can say something. I'm sure Melissa doesn't need a co-therapist. Your mom needs to back off.", "NTA - Your mother should be nowhere near the therapy room. It is supposed to be confidential and is absolutely not conducive to an open conversation with your therapist.\n\nHave you considered doing something like DBT (Dialectical Behavioural Therapy) first which helps with emotional regulation during periods of stress (which would include talking about trauma)? This may be an idea before heading straight into trauma based therapy.\n\nAlso, stop pressuring yourself to feel like you have \u201csucceeded\u201d at therapy and that you have to talk about one particular topic. This will also stop you from opening up, as you will feel like you have to be \u201cbetter\u201d.\n\nI have been going to therapy twice a week for two years and I\u2019ve only just started opening up and it\u2019s taken me till in my 40s to talk about it AT ALL with another human being, so you\u2019re actually doing fantastically.\n\nMain thing is to talk about what\u2019s on your mind there and then, so if it\u2019s that you\u2019re feeling uncomfortable that\u2019s on your mind, that is what you should be talking about in the therapy.", "NTA. I went through something similar with a therapist when I was around your age. I had a therapist who was GREAT from 16-17 and right before I turned 18 he died in a car accident. I was heartbroken, but still open to pursue therapy. Next therapist I had for around 6 months then out of the blue she told me she was leaving the job to start a family. I  avoided therapy for several years after that. Wjen I finally came back around when I was 25, it was difficult to open up AGAIN and took alot of time and consistency before I was comfortable enough to really talk. What ultimately helped us build a syrong and genuine bond was communicating via written letters and email. I could *say* all the things I had a hard time speaking out loud if that makes sense. \n\nIs it possible for you to speak to your therapist without mom present? Maybe you could casually ask if she has an email so you can write her the thoughts that you have trouble talking about. Maybe you could phrase it in a way that doesn't make mom go all helicopter-hover. Kinda just like \"hey, is it possible for me to email you sometimes? There are some things I have a hard time speaking out loud.\" Then you could take the time you need to document things that you want her to know without the audience or pressure of a timer, ya know? \n\nEither way, I sincerely wish you the best and all the comfort and happiness in the world. Dealing with trauma is hard at any age, but especially when you're young and feel like you can't express it freely and openly. I hope that Melissa ends up being the best damned therapist that walks the earth and that she becomes a comfort and outlet for you to work through your troubles. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udda4", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is not uncommon in therapy - for the person seeking help to feel like they need to establish trust. Your mom is trying to create a timeline for you when trauma doesn't give a flying f\\*ck about timelines. Be kind to yourself. \n\nIs your mom in any of your therapy sessions? If so she is probably actually doing more damage than help at this point. Maybe what you need to talk to your therapist right now is feeling like you have a safe environment at home to talk about everything.", "NTA for sureeee\nYou were the one who went through the pain, and you are the one who is dealing with the aftermath. No one else, but you, can know when the time is right. If possible, arrange a meeting with your therapist and your mom, with you present, so you can have help when you enforce your boundaries. Best of luck OP", "Nta. I'd start by opening up to her about the trauma of therapists/confidantes leaving, and how that's making it hard to talk about deeper/older traumas.", "NTA. OP you are definitely not the AH. I'm a therapist who works with clients who have trauma. It is simply taking you time to feel comfortable enough with Melissa. It is completely normal for people to need a lot of time to build that trust, especially if they've had therapists leave in the past or have a history of feeling abandoned. I had a client who took about a year before she could comfortably talk about her trauma history. It may be helpful for you to let Melissa know that you are struggling with building trust due to these past things that have happened (even if you don't go into any detail about each thing). If Melissa is a good therapist she will understand and will help you build that trust with her. I wish you the best of luck in being able to deal with your trauma history.", "NTA. You might need to change therapist. Not everyone is the right fit.", "NAH. Think of your mother - and yourself - as getting frustrated rather than mad. She wants you to get help; you want you to get help. So does Melissa, she wants to be able to help. But pressuring yourself isn't the way to go about opening up. I'm sure pressure was part of the trauma. Can you ask for something that might help, or talk about something you'd like to talk about that's not directly about the trauma? Just get used to talking to her and then see how you feel. You aren't doing anything wrong. \n\nAnd maybe it would go easier actually if you were talking face-to-face, if that's ever possible? Even doing the drive once might help. Or talk without your mom present, even if it means more silence?", "Thanks. I see your point I just wanted an outsiders perspective since I\u2019ve never really knew what to do in therapy since my last therapies I\u2019ve either been dropped, finished before the trauma, or they left", "Melissa does know about it. I didn\u2019t think about it that way thanks", "Thank you so much this helps", "Yeah I could speak to my therapist without my mom it\u2019s just been scary because I\u2019ve had a hard time even speaking up to someone. I feel like I can only talk to my bf about this heh. Maybe it\u2019s because he\u2019s seen me at my worst? But I\u2019ll try to talk alone. I see her tomorrow so I\u2019ll update after I see her", "Idk I just wanted an outsiders perspective if that makes sense in a way?", "She is because I\u2019m terrified to be alone due to past traumas I have", "Thank you I\u2019ll make an update when I see Melissa again I have therapy twice a week and should be seeing her tomorrow so I\u2019ll update with how it goes", "She does kinda know about it and swears she won\u2019t leave but it\u2019s still scary. Thank you for bringing it up", "Thank you. I know it takes time but I don\u2019t know if this changes anything but the trauma is affecting my every day lifestyle and how I function day to day", "I see your point. I\u2019m gonna be honest the therapist isn\u2019t the problem. It\u2019s more me", "Yes that's fair...and I don't think you are an asshole...but maybe letting melissa know why you don't talk so much would help get things going in therapy.", "I'm very sorry about that. Your mom is not going to be helpful here. You can't have her in your sessions getting mad that you aren't talking about your trauma. She will harm you more. You need to be in sessions with just your therapist.", "Yeah you\u2019re right", "I see that thank you so much", "Do you **really** want your mother in therapy with you? It makes me think your mom might be inadvertently getting in the way.", "I don\u2019t know at this point because I feel like I can\u2019t speak up about anything because I shut down and get in defense mode cuz of my past. I didn\u2019t even realize about my mom"]}
