(However, I have aced through several levels of advanced calculus, so I am not ignorant in math by any means.) But because he is better and likes it more, I have always let him handle it.  He has always been very reasonable and has structured it to where we each pay a percentage of our paycheck to a shared account for bills and the rest goes to our individual accounts.  However, recently we have been having some marital problems with the very real possibility of divorce on the table.  We are trying to make things work, but the possibility has really made me think a lot about finances and the future.\n\nSince he has started a new job and his pay has changed, the overall amounts put in would need to be shifted anyway.  So I mentioned to him today that since we would be making some adjustments anyway, I\u2019d like to sit down with him and look over all the finances together to see what adjustments we can make to help make some smart investments for the future.  He replied that he had \u201calready made a spreadsheet\u201d and that I \u201cwould owe more and when (he) finished it, (he) would let me know what (I) owe\u201d.  I didn\u2019t appreciate this response very much as it came off to me as if I wasn\u2019t part of the the process, that he would make all the decisions and I would basically just pay whatever he told me.  So I again said \u201cI would like to sit down and go through everything together and make a plan together\u201d.  To which he responded \u201cno, I don\u2019t want to go through it together.  You can see my spreadsheet when it\u2019s done.\u201d  \n\nAt this point I\u2019m getting upset, and so I again say that this is a partnership and I want to do this together.  He refuses and says that he wants to  \u201cdo it alone\u201d.  That he has always done it, that it is a \u201cone person job\u201d and he will be doing it and I can look at his spreadsheet.  I said, \u201cif it\u2019s a one person job, why don\u2019t I make the spreadsheet\u201d? He then states he \u201cdoesn\u2019t trust me to make the spreadsheet\u201d and \u201cdo you even know how to make a spreadsheet?\u201d  This is deeply insulting as I have a Master\u2019s degree and many years of advanced math.  (I actually have a higher degree than he does, but obviously didn\u2019t point that out as that is a jerk move.) Then he says that I can \u201cgo ahead and make (my) own spreadsheet, but that (he) won\u2019t give me any of the info\u201d so I can make it.  So withholding info about our joint bills from me.  So I am pretty upset at this point and getting loud and upset saying that this is a partnership and that I want to be involved.  He gets angry in response and uses profanity in front of our young children as well as starts disparaging me in front of them, calling me \u201cinsane\u201d and telling me I\u2019m \u201cbeing nuts\u201d.
