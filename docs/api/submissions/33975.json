However, my mom took his side so I think that I might be in the wrong on this one. \n\nI\u2019m of Balkan ancestry and shaving my legs is a pain in the ass. I do it regularly in the summer, but in the winter I don\u2019t really do it much. As a result, my legs get hairy af. I don\u2019t really care, for the most part. I understand it\u2019s an unconventional choice but I\u2019m kinda artsy and weird. \n\nMy dad is adamant that I shave my legs \u201cto look prettier.\u201d I told him that I\u2019m not trying to look pretty for him and that I\u2019m not trying to impress anyone. He told me that it\u2019s \u201ca hygiene thing,\u201d and compared it to brushing my hair. He said he\u2019s disappointed in me for \u201cnot grooming myself\u201d by shaving my legs, and compared me negatively to other girls in my age range that he knows. He says that I should always want to look \u201cpresentable.\u201d \n\nHonestly, I got really emotional and started crying. I told him that it has nothing to do with looking presentable or hygiene, that I\u2019m not trying to impress anyone, and that it was weird for him to be noticing other girls\u2019 appearances like that. I also told him that I especially don\u2019t want to shave my legs now, because I don\u2019t want to give him the satisfaction.

It does seem very weird though that your father seems so obsessed with your legs. And BTW, there is nothing unhygienic in not shaving your legs, in fact the opposite.  I would gently suggest to Mom that maybe dear old pop might need some therapy for his obsession over girl's legs.  Just sayin'", "NTA. \nYour dad has a serious problem though.", "Does he shave his legs? No? Then it's not for sanitary reasons.", "NTA and ewwww - your dad's fixation on this is seriously disgusting. I'd rethink spending time with them if they are going to be sexualizing you like that ...\n\nAs for the actual shaving thing - fuck anyone telling you how to handle your hygiene.

If not, he's a hypocrite.", "NTA \n\nAsk him why he doesn\u2019t shave his filth unhygienic legs.\n\nWhy is your dad looking at 24yr olds sexually?", "NTA that is nuts, your parents can shove it. It\u2019s your body, you\u2019re fine. Boundaries", "NTA, but sounds like you are also making friction where it is completely unnecessary.

You can get rashes, broken skin, which can invite in bacteria, etc. The only concern would be chaffing, which of course is YOUR issue, not his. \n\nHe\u2019s older so I understand where he\u2019s coming from, women not shaving wasn\u2019t common in his generation or was associated with \u201cdirty hippies\u201d. But times have changed. And the amount of stress/time/energy/money involved in keeping up with it, especially if you have course/thick hair, is just not worth it! \n\nIf you can explain this to him gently I think it would help him understand better.

If it's so unhygienic, does that mean he regularly gets his shit waxed or something? This is a bizarre argument to attack one's daughter about.

I hope you understand how truly crazy it is they got mad at you for not shaving. It isn't your fault they chose to get upset about something they had no business speaking about. \n\nBottom line, it's **YOUR** body. You don't need to change your shaving habits to please your dad. Let that leg hair grow baby!\n\nETA: I'm sorry, but your dad sounds like a fucking creep who has done his best to instill some serious body image issues in his daughter, all so she can please a man. The swimsuit statement is truly disturbing. This is beyond messed up and you don't deserve to be treated in such a way.", "This is easy. They're your legs. Your parents have no say in whether you shave them. And if your dad thinks it's a \"hygiene thing\", do feel free to ask why he doesn't shave his ass. NTA.", "NTA.

They may shave if they have a special event. It\u2019s normal to not shave. Your dad is being sexist.", "Thank him for his input, tell,him you love him, then leave.

Your legs, your hair, your choice. He can offer his opinion but can't tell you what to do.", "NTA - I am so so sorry you were treated like that by the two people who should care the very least about hairy legs. It is NOT a hygiene issue, otherwise men would shave their legs, and let's not talk about their backs. You are not wrong and it's not gross, unhygienic or something that has anything to do with the quality of your character. Their reactions does however say loads about theirs.", "Definitely NTA. I\u2019m 24 and I stopped shaving my legs around 14 years old. There\u2019s been a few comments from other adults in my family, mostly my grandma. But the main thing they always forget is YOU are the one who has to deal with the maintenance of shaving and keeping up with your leg hair. For me, it was more uncomfortable to have my legs stubbly all the time than to deal with a few comments here or there. I can promise you no one notices and if they do judge, they\u2019re not the right partner for you anyways. Fuck em!", "NTA and good for you for standing up to him. I think your reasons are perfectly fine and he can get over it.", "You are NTA. Your dad is.", "NTA. Hair grows on everybody\u2019s bodies and it\u2019s not unhygienic to keep it there. If you\u2019re washing your legs when you shower, you\u2019re being hygienic. Just like washing the hair on your head is hygienic. \n\nI too often don\u2019t shave my legs or armpits in the winter. It\u2019s no one\u2019s business but mine.

My rule is if you can't see it when I'm dressed for the day, it's not getting shaved. Especially in the winter, it's my extra insulation lol", "NTA I always used to take the winter off from shaving my legs. I have dry skin so taking a break from shaving is good.

Absolutely ridiculous argument on his part. Continue to ignore. He is being unacceptably sexist.", "Definitely NTA! I can\u2019t stand when people try to tell women who choose not to shave as it being a \u201chygiene issue\u201d. What about men??? My daughter doesn\u2019t shave. It shouldn\u2019t be an issue. I only shave because it\u2019s a sensory thing for me.", "NTA. I personally dislike having body hair, so I had hair removal done. Shaving is a pain in the ass, I used to get a lot of cuts and ingrown hair, etc., and I had to do it almost every day. Hair removal is expensive,  but worth it to me. My body, my choice.

Does your dad shave his legs? Arms? Underarms?  How is leg hair any less hygienic than arm hair?  Head hair?", "Your father is a bullying misogynist.  There\u2019s no more reason for women to shave any part of their body than there is for men.  To insist otherwise is as your father admits, a way to shame women into performing femininity for the pleasure of men.  In this case, him.

Shorter arms? No thumbs? lol \ud83d\ude02 \n\nNTA. If it bothers them, they should shield their eyes. If it was a hygiene issue, we\u2019d all have shaved heads.

And if someone _is_ paying close attention, you can still decide how you want them - silkier or smoother.", "NTA\n\nWhy in the world does your dad care how pretty his daughter's legs are?  That's majorly creepy.  It is **NOT** a hygiene thing.  If it were, why wouldn't men also shave their legs?  If anything, shaving your legs increases your risk of infection from small skin cuts.\n\nWhat it comes down to is, in your AH dad's eyes, it's Completely, Morally Wrong for a woman not to shave her legs.

And shaving is a pain in the ass, I\u2019m also pretty hairy and during winter I definitely don\u2019t shave as much.

Does he do anything else weird like that towards you?", "NTA. There's no way your father should be commenting on your looks in this way. It's intrusive and frankly a bit creepy.

My older bro told me to shave my pits because it makes HIM uncomfortable lmao, like what?!", "NTA. your body your choice. Your dad is just producing sexist, mysogynist bs.

Tell him you'll shave yours when he shaves his.", "NTA.  Your dad's a bully who thinks it is the role of women in the world to give him something pleasant to look at when they aren't washing his dishes or cooking his food.

When people comment \"you have hairy legs\" I'll say something like \"well that's where hair grows\" and if a man tells me to shave I'll just tell him to shave.

Try not to take it to heart.", "NTA\n\nI'm like you in that I bother to shave in the summer when I wear clothes that expose my arms and legs  but don't bother in the winter where no one except me is going to see my legs anyway.  While I do prefer the no body hair except on the head look for myself, it's way too much effort to shave regularly when  no one will even know/see. \n\nIt's kind of gross, too, that your own father is making remarks like that. From any other man (or person in general) if would be annoying af, but from a family member? Ew. Just icky. It definitely implies looking at someone with sexual intentions if you tell them they aren't attractive if they don't do such and such.", "Okay...so this is not about your legs. Consider no contact for a little while, and find a therapist who can help you with the self-esteem they've been attempting to destroy your entire life. You ARE good enough.  NTA. Not even close. *hugs*", "I know there are a lot of women these days who have opted out of shaving their underarms or legs, but it still doesn't seem to be a really popular choice.  I must admit it takes a little bit of getting used to when I see hairy underarms on women, but if more people decided to do it, it would become the norm. If guys had to shave every day and try to keep their legs constantly smooth and hair free, they'd soon get tired of it. That's why so many of them grow beards. Waxing is expensive and painful, and I don't know about other methods, but I'm sure they're not cheap either.\n\nAnyway, I guess if enough women band together and start a movement to go natural, it will eventually become accepted. However, men are so tied up with the idea of hairless women being sexy that I don't know if it will ever be completely accepted.\n\nAs far as your dad making comments about your hairy legs, he has the right to voice his opinion, but you also have the right to do what you see fit with your body.", "NTA. Since it's totally about hygiene he shaves **his** legs too, right? \n\nIt's straight up sexism. The fact that he prioritizes these arbitrary rules made literally just to sell us more shit and tank our self-esteem in a way that doesn't affect him or other men at all, instead of YOU HER DAUGHTER having your own choices in the matter... you are not being childish", "WTF is your dad telling you to shave your legs for? Is he trying to bang you?", "You're too old for your dad to be policing your body. If you know it is a problem for him, wear sweatpants when you're at his house and just avoid the issue.
