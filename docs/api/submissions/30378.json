{"id": 30378, "submission_id": "17ogiow", "title": "AITA for getting a child to clean up a smashed mug?", "selftext": "My house rule for my own children is \"You f\\*\\*k it, you fix it.\" So you clean your own mess, you close doors you open, you apologize to people you upset, you add an item to the shopping list if you use the last of it etc. When I look after nieces and nephews, the same rules applies.\n\nI was looking after my 6 year old niece, Martha, for a few days in the school holidays. I made some hot chocolate but Martha dropped her mug and it broke. I told her accidents happen, no big deal. I told her not to move till I got her shoes so she wouldn't stand on the bits and cut herself, then together we swept up the broken shards and mopped the floor - this was in the kitchen where I have slate tiles. Dropped things do not bounce! I have a child-sized broom and mop set from when my children where small which I still have, so I showed her how to mop and did the bulk of it, while she copied me. I then made more hot chocolate and we watched the film we were going to watch.\n\nWhen my sister came to collect her, she stayed for a while. A drink was left too close to the edge of the table and was knocked over. Little Martha went and grabbed the mini-mop and tried to clean it up, then asked how to mop carpet. I showed her how to get a tea towel, and stamp on it to get all the liquid up, then hang the tea towel to dry. My sister just watched in silence.\n\nMy sister asked Martha how she knew about the mop, and she told her about the hot chocolate and broken mug. My sister then started shouting at me, saying it was very dangerous to make a child that young clean up hot liquid and shards of ceramic. I said she was about to drink it so it wasn't hot enough to burn her, and she used a broom and had shoes on, so didn't touch or tread on any shards. Besides, I did most of it and cleaning up accidents is something she will need to learn at some point, so why not start it young?\n\nMy sister then asked if I thought her house was messy. I said no and that isn't the point, but she was not going to pick up after Martha her entire life, and if she is at my house then to a certain extent it is my rules. I followed her rules in terms of diet and only fed vegetarian food and stuck her her usual bedtimes. I do feel there is still an element of following my rules in my house and part of that is \"you f\\*\\*k it, you fix it\"  - I don't expect her to do it alone and I will help and show her how, but even if it as accident, I do expect her to at least try and clean it up. It is the same with toys, I don't expect it to be utter perfection as she is only 6, but I do expect her have tried to tidy up once she has finished playing with something e.g. put the right game in the right box, and put the game back on the shelf it came from.\n\nMy sister is now not speaking to me and has said I will not be allowed to look after Martha unsupervised if I don't admit I put her in danger. I don't feel I did, and said as much.

You acted perfectly, helped her learn a lesson in being careful and taught her how to clean up a mess. Your sister is wrong here. You\u2019re never too young or too old to learn something new.", "Nta. You taught kiddo a basic life skill.\n\nIf you\u2019d left her alone barefoot and struggling g with some paper towels, and she got cut up\u2026  that\u2019d be a different thing. \n\nNow she knows how to safely clean up glass/sharps. \n\nYour sister is ridiculous.", "My son was 4 the first time he cleaned a toilet after pooping on the seat. I had to clean it after he smeared it everywhere, but he was old enough to learn that he has a responsibility. Also, did your sister not see how quickly and willingly her daughter responded to volunteer to clean after herself? This is the time to encourage these responsible habits.", "NTA - you sound like a great parent that is raising accountable children.  If your sister is willing to lose (free?) babysitting over this, well then let her die on this hill.  \n\nAlso, a 6-year-old is not incapable of picking up some sharp objects with close supervision.  I'm sure there are plenty of daycares/school systems that would expect a 6-year-old to help clean up a mess like this; not everyone treats children like china dolls.", "No, not at all.", "NTA My goodness, today's parents are a bunch of babies, aren't they? Seriously, show of hands...who knew how to safely clean up after themselves at this age? \ud83d\udc4b\nAnd no, I'm not a boomer. I'm a GenX and an elementary school teacher. We need to do better by our children. By the time they are 6, they should know how to clean up their messes with good supervision, they should know how to fold their own little bits of laundry and even put away the things they can reach, and they should have their own broom and dustpan because guess what...these are life skills and most little children love doing stuff like that. All of our kindergarten kiddos can use a children's size broom and dustpan to clean up their area. In fact, it's so popular, it's a classroom job, so there is no arguing over whose turn it is. \nIf OP had yelled at the little one and made her clean it all by herself, that would be different. But OP didn't. Instead, she showed her how to do something safely. Good job OP.", "NTA\n\nShe's being crazy", "Like you said your house, your rules. She wasn\u2019t in danger and she should learn to clean up after herself otherwise she\u2019ll grow up to be a needy adult child who still has her mother and father around to tend her every need. NTA and I hope you know that.", "This is a seriously innocent act. I would've done this too, I'm sure (especially because my niece is a good little helper\u2764\ufe0f ). Your sister is overreacting and I'm not sure why...does not make for a great sibling relationship. Only thing I can think of is she's jealous for some reason (you may be more successful or a better parent, in her eyes). NTA.", "NTA you helped her clean it up.  You didn\u2019t throw her to the wolves.  You made sure she had shoes on to protect herself.  She\u2019s old enough to help clean up after herself.", "NTA . oh my god you're allowed to meet Martha unsupervised. How sad lol.", "Nta. And thanks for not coddling kids. The world has hope.", "NTA. This is instilling responsibility in children early, which will help her out in life. Your sister also seems overprotective. You helped Martha and made sure she had her shoes and proper tools to clean. Plus that is super immature that she isn't talking to you anymore. She could have simply disagreed, but I do not understand why she is making such a big deal of it?!", "NTA. She didn't hurt herself and it is a good lesson to learn.", "NTA, you were there helping her, explaining how to address what happened correctly & cleaning it up.", "NTA and you sound like an awesome parent who is raising awesome and responsible humans.", "NTA\n\nYou helped her, which means you picked up the 'dangerous' pieces. You didnt make her do it herself, and you are absolutely right, she will need to learn at some point and the best way to learn something is by emulation. \n\nMartha wasnt in any danger. Had your sister been there she would have seen that. Either she trusts you with the care of her child or she doesnt. If she doesnt, then she can find someone else to take care of Martha and pay them, as opposed to having her loving aunt (you) take care of her 'for a couple of days during the holidays' for free.", "NTA. You were caring and responsible. Carry on.", "Sounds like a win win to me NTA", "NTA at 6yo, she\u2019s capable of cleaning up her own messes. My 2yo cleans up her own messes. Yes, there\u2019s supervision because a) they\u2019re kids and b) there was glass, but how else are they going to learn? She was ridiculous for getting upset about you teaching her daughter to clean (once she realized you made sure she was cleaning safely).", "This sounds unbelievable, because there is no reason for your sister to even be mad here, and its rather odd that all these drinks are spilling in the same day. \n\nI mean, obviously if this is a real story, NTA, but this is clearly fabricated or you left out a huge part of the story as to why your sister would be acting this way.", "Wow, you sound like a great mum, you showed Martha how to clean and helped her through it. You make sure she was safe by getting her shoes but also she understood that it was her responsibility to tidy her own messes. This sounds like great parenting, teaching kids that accidents happen and that's ok but taking responsibility for them is important. I don't know why your sister can't see that but your house, your rules.\n\nDepending on the age of your children I may not use quite that wording when explaining it to them but the concept is spot on.
