I made some hot chocolate but Martha dropped her mug and it broke. I told her accidents happen, no big deal. I told her not to move till I got her shoes so she wouldn't stand on the bits and cut herself, then together we swept up the broken shards and mopped the floor - this was in the kitchen where I have slate tiles. Dropped things do not bounce! I have a child-sized broom and mop set from when my children where small which I still have, so I showed her how to mop and did the bulk of it, while she copied me. I then made more hot chocolate and we watched the film we were going to watch.\n\nWhen my sister came to collect her, she stayed for a while. A drink was left too close to the edge of the table and was knocked over. Little Martha went and grabbed the mini-mop and tried to clean it up, then asked how to mop carpet. I showed her how to get a tea towel, and stamp on it to get all the liquid up, then hang the tea towel to dry. My sister just watched in silence.\n\nMy sister asked Martha how she knew about the mop, and she told her about the hot chocolate and broken mug. My sister then started shouting at me, saying it was very dangerous to make a child that young clean up hot liquid and shards of ceramic. I said she was about to drink it so it wasn't hot enough to burn her, and she used a broom and had shoes on, so didn't touch or tread on any shards. Besides, I did most of it and cleaning up accidents is something she will need to learn at some point, so why not start it young?\n\nMy sister then asked if I thought her house was messy. I said no and that isn't the point, but she was not going to pick up after Martha her entire life, and if she is at my house then to a certain extent it is my rules. I followed her rules in terms of diet and only fed vegetarian food and stuck her her usual bedtimes. I do feel there is still an element of following my rules in my house and part of that is \"you f\\*\\*k it, you fix it\"  - I don't expect her to do it alone and I will help and show her how, but even if it as accident, I do expect her to at least try and clean it up. It is the same with toys, I don't expect it to be utter perfection as she is only 6, but I do expect her have tried to tidy up once she has finished playing with something e.g. put the right game in the right box, and put the game back on the shelf it came from.\n\nMy sister is now not speaking to me and has said I will not be allowed to look after Martha unsupervised if I don't admit I put her in danger.

We need to do better by our children. By the time they are 6, they should know how to clean up their messes with good supervision, they should know how to fold their own little bits of laundry and even put away the things they can reach, and they should have their own broom and dustpan because guess what...these are life skills and most little children love doing stuff like that. All of our kindergarten kiddos can use a children's size broom and dustpan to clean up their area. In fact, it's so popular, it's a classroom job, so there is no arguing over whose turn it is. \nIf OP had yelled at the little one and made her clean it all by herself, that would be different.

By the time Martha\u2019s \u201cold enough\u201d to contribute, she won\u2019t want to, and she\u2019ll have learned that it\u2019s not her responsibility to do anything around the house.", "Absolutely NTA!! You showed Martha how to take care of herself. You instilled in her \n1) self respect & confidence\n2) messes happen and are no big deal\n3) dignity in fixing a problem\n4) important life skills i.e. cleaning different types of flooring\n\nShe is now more prepared for the world because of you, and she will always remember having a wonderful time with you from start to finish. She immediately wanted to clean up the second spill because she was confident and eager to participate.\n\nShe will likely always remember how to clean a spill, long after she forgets what movie you watched together! \n\nPlease keep supporting her in whatever way her mom allows. My guess is her mom actually feels a bit guilty for not supporting Martha\u2019s independence as skillfully as you. It might help to let some time pass and see if she is willing to hear another apology and explanation.", "NTA. Your sister was overreacting. People often underestimate a child's ability to learn how to perform a simple task safely and carefully. They always assume the worst, have irrational fears, and think of their child as wreckless, which puts the child in a box and prevents them from learning :(", "Big big NTA! My ex husband and I have a child together, at 14  really didn't have daily chores with him and the discussion of chores is usually met with \"they are just too little\"  consequently  as they get older he called to complain sometimes that getting them to help around the house is difficult, they don't have any with ethic, ECT. \n\nMy younger two I am a solo parent to, they both at 7 and 9 have daily household chores for the household. They also take additional chores as they see them needing done and  doing things without adding a lot like clearing up after dinner. \n\n My 9 year old can also cook several meals, and often volunteers to make breakfast or lunch for him and his younger sister. \n\nAnd through all this I've learned that kids will only grow as much as you let them. I love my oldest but because my ex didn't let our kid grow in that aspect they didn't and now teaching them these things is harder.    I know his heart was in the right place, he was trying to make up for his own childhood but he went too far the other way and now he's dealing with the results. \n\nThere's a happy medium of teaching responsibilities and your niece is   right in that zone. Kids can do difficult things with supervision.", "NTA. What you did and expected was developmentally appropriate and you were teaching this child some independence and life skills! Your sister should probably take notes.", "NTA.\n\nYou made sure she stayed put to grab her shoes. And *then* you asked her to help. If it was glass I could maybe understand your sisters side of it, but ceramic isn\u2019t glass. Sure it has sharp pieces but that\u2019s why you had her use a broom.\n\nMartha jumping up to grab the mop and asking you how to use it is a huge sign that she enjoyed being included in cleaning up! Of course it\u2019s a good lesson for her to learn, and you\u2019re doing it perfectly! She\u2019s obviously not going to be able to clean it all by herself, so you did the bulk, but she\u2019s learning. And being held accountable age appropriately. Even if it\u2019s an accident we have to fix our faults! \n\nYour sister took that personally af.", "NTA and you provided your niece a great learning moment! As a kid I\u2019d often get yelled at for breaking something. I wish someone kindly said it\u2019s not a big deal, accidents happen. I wish someone would have taught me how to clean up the mess instead of doing it for me so I felt more like a burden. This is a great step of independence for a child her age.", "NTA, Your sister is over protective, over reacted, It was the perfect time to teach the child to be responsible, end of story", "My one year old loves helping me to wipe up spills, etc. How else do they learn? NTA", "NTA. You taught Martha a useful skill and helped her learn responsible reactions when she makes a mess, and you did it all without making her feel bad. If your sister doesn't want you to babysit, then I guess she's going to have to pay someone to do it. \n\nI started teaching my sons to clean up after them selves around 4. Whenever we cooked, they also helped wipe up messes and learned that you don't use utensils that have hit the floor. They learned to dry non-breakable items we'd used (no dishwasher) and were eager to step up to wash when they could reach. (Note: this joy fades fast and disappears entirely by pre-teen years.) These are super basic and important skills for children. Later, I taught their friends to cook and garden and do yard work, because they wanted to know how. Kids are sponges for information and like doing new things, and they really like being praised for doing a good job. Good for you for realizing that. I hope your sister comes around to active parenting.", "NTA.", "NTA You did nothing wrong. Your sister is acting lie a jerk.", "NTA", "NTA. Your children were raised that way and never had an incident. She\u2019s trying to coddle her when it appears Miss Martha was eager to practice her new skill!", "NTA at all and I am totally remembering this because it\u2019s awesome parenting!", "NTA in general but 6 years old is too young to be cleaning up things that can cut them. As long as she did as small amount of the mug part as you say I think it was fine. Personally I don\u2019t mess with glass/ceramic with my kids. They clean up their messes otherwise, but anything that can harm them is a watch and learn situation rather than an immersive experience. I\u2019ve cut myself too many times being careful and I won\u2019t risk my kids getting cut. \nThe sister was weird to yell at you for it though. She seems a little unhinged", "She sounds like one of the people who used to throw a fit when I was a kid and they realised I was using proper scissors (not those awful plastic ones that don't even cut paper, because my mum got sick of watching me get frustrated and upset while trying to use them) and using sewing needles and thread at the age of 3. 6 is not too young to do most things with supervision. I'd say maybe a bit too young to use a stove or that type of thing, but using a broom? C'mon. Teaching a child how to clean up a mess is also a good way to help them process what has happened, and alleviates any potential guilt about breaking something because they are being a part of the solution. NTA.", "NTA. You're helping her and teaching her valuable life skills, whilst your sister is setting her up for failure by wrapping her in bubble wrap and not teaching her accountability/consequences. Kids have to learn at some point, and I think the way you went about it was the right way - you didn't let your niece clean it up by herself, you showed her how to do it safely and did so together. When it occurred again she immediately wanted to help as you obviously made it a positive experience for her - that's something to stimulate, not to punish. \n\nMore people should raise their kids like you do OP \ud83d\udcaa", "NTA. But in my house, if glass/ceramic breaks, the kids need to freeze, stay where you are. Grown ups clean the glass. My kids can be pretty clumsy, and I don't need blood and cuts along with broken glass. I get a little paranoid about glass/ceramics.  My kids refuse to wear socks in the house so I need to get every piece up and you know that stuff can travel! But if it broke in 2 and it didn't shatter, I understand your thinking.", "NTA. This seems like a good teaching moment. You ensured she had foot protection and showed her how to clean the mess instead of telling her to just figure it out. There was no anger, yelling or criticism. She's learning that mistakes happen and that's okay as long as you do your best to fix them. Teaching kids these lessons early means they won't have to unlearn bad habits and flounder by themselves when they're older. You doing it with her almost makes it seem like a team activity instead of a chore. \n\nConcern about cuts is valid but I wonder if your sister is just insulted that you expect her child to clean while under your roof. Or perhaps she's of the mindset that her daughter is still too young for most tasks and is used to doing them all for her.", "NTA. A 6 year old is old enough to learn to clean up. Bonus points because you did it in such a great way - treated her kindly when she spilled, made sure she was safe with shoes on and even had the child sized tools to help her feel accomplished in the end. Heck, she even learned about how liquids absorb differently on different surfaces when she went to grab a mop for the carpet.\n\nThese are life skills. My two year old puts his clothes in the washer, adds soap and turns it on (all supervised). He also helps load the silverware in the dishwasher. On the flip side, I once asked my 8 year old nephew to pick up the 3-4 potato chips he dropped while walking. My MIL laughed and said \u201cwhat\u2019s next? You think he\u2019s going to put his plate in the dishwasher?\u201d", "You see id rather this than being yelled and screamed at and told to get the fuck out of the room NTA", "NTA \nI did something similar with my kids. They are rockstars of self sufficience and do not leave messes for others in restaurants, airplanes, people's apartments, girlfriends houses, and generally handle their sh!t. \n\nTheir friends often ask them, \"how do I get this stain out?\" \"How do i fix this rip?\" \"how do I stop the bleeding?\"(last one is because I have boys who were loved and warned frequently, but were danger prone and I made them help sanitize and treat with small self-induced injuries caused by carelessness. My youngest is now a Medic who is regularly gobsmacked at the lack of basic skills around him). Go you for teachin' em young.", "I'm learning this the hard way now.\n\nMy mom tried to tell me--- let them help! They need to learn sometime!... but no... they were too little... too slow... I was too impatient and frustrated that it took them 2xs as long to do 1/2 as much. \n\nNow I have 3 teen boys... my house is always a mess, somedays I come home and it smells like feet, dishes, shoes, backpacks and jackets everywhere... I have to be on the verge of losing my mind before I get help.\n\nI wish I had started them young.", "NTA.  Kids need to be taught to be resilient, be it an accident at home or a setback in life.

She knows accidents happen, that they are no big deal, and we can clean up and get on with the task at hand.\n\nYour sister needs to get over herself.  Her job as a parent is to teach her child how to live in a life without her.

This approach is safe and fine, NTA", "I get so tired of people complaining that the younger generation doesn\u2019t know how to to basic tasks like sew a button or change a tire.

The guy she turned away from started screaming at her that I made the mess so I should clean it up, which is what was happening, but I was a small child and need a bit of guidance so I wouldn\u2019t cut myself. Neither the cashier nor my father took very kindly to this regular, who absolutely knew who I was, screaming at me for having an accident. \n\nYou didn\u2019t shove a broom and a mop at her and yell at her to clean it, you were teaching her responsibility. What\u2019s wrong with your sister?", "NTA. You didn\u2019t put the child in danger.

You are teaching life lessons to your children and to your neice. There is nothing wrong with teaching a 6 yr old how clean up  broken glass properly so they don't cut themselves.
