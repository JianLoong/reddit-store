I made some hot chocolate but Martha dropped her mug and it broke. I told her accidents happen, no big deal. I told her not to move till I got her shoes so she wouldn't stand on the bits and cut herself, then together we swept up the broken shards and mopped the floor - this was in the kitchen where I have slate tiles. Dropped things do not bounce! I have a child-sized broom and mop set from when my children where small which I still have, so I showed her how to mop and did the bulk of it, while she copied me. I then made more hot chocolate and we watched the film we were going to watch.\n\nWhen my sister came to collect her, she stayed for a while. A drink was left too close to the edge of the table and was knocked over. Little Martha went and grabbed the mini-mop and tried to clean it up, then asked how to mop carpet. I showed her how to get a tea towel, and stamp on it to get all the liquid up, then hang the tea towel to dry. My sister just watched in silence.\n\nMy sister asked Martha how she knew about the mop, and she told her about the hot chocolate and broken mug. My sister then started shouting at me, saying it was very dangerous to make a child that young clean up hot liquid and shards of ceramic. I said she was about to drink it so it wasn't hot enough to burn her, and she used a broom and had shoes on, so didn't touch or tread on any shards. Besides, I did most of it and cleaning up accidents is something she will need to learn at some point, so why not start it young?\n\nMy sister then asked if I thought her house was messy. I said no and that isn't the point, but she was not going to pick up after Martha her entire life, and if she is at my house then to a certain extent it is my rules. I followed her rules in terms of diet and only fed vegetarian food and stuck her her usual bedtimes. I do feel there is still an element of following my rules in my house and part of that is \"you f\\*\\*k it, you fix it\"  - I don't expect her to do it alone and I will help and show her how, but even if it as accident, I do expect her to at least try and clean it up. It is the same with toys, I don't expect it to be utter perfection as she is only 6, but I do expect her have tried to tidy up once she has finished playing with something e.g. put the right game in the right box, and put the game back on the shelf it came from.\n\nMy sister is now not speaking to me and has said I will not be allowed to look after Martha unsupervised if I don't admit I put her in danger.

We need to do better by our children. By the time they are 6, they should know how to clean up their messes with good supervision, they should know how to fold their own little bits of laundry and even put away the things they can reach, and they should have their own broom and dustpan because guess what...these are life skills and most little children love doing stuff like that. All of our kindergarten kiddos can use a children's size broom and dustpan to clean up their area. In fact, it's so popular, it's a classroom job, so there is no arguing over whose turn it is. \nIf OP had yelled at the little one and made her clean it all by herself, that would be different.

Tons of parents would\u2019ve yelled at their kid for making a mess.", "NTA. I think you gave her tools for how to deal with mistakes in a constructive way and I think your sister is feeling defensive that you taught her daughter something she has not.", "NTA-- This is an excellent way for Martha to learn life skills. Additionally, when we make cleanup part of the process when messes happen, we take the shame out of making a mess. It happens but will clean it up. It's okay.

I'm a speech therapist. We often use board games (special ones for our purposes or general ones with changed rules) or other toys, and afterwards it's cleaned up together. I've had children call me names when they were supposed to do as much as put pillows (to sit on) away. I've had half the time left get wasted on putting away toys, or rather the child refusing to. And I've had other kids who offer to clean up by themselves and it's no problem. Generally, the difficult ones come around after several visits, when they learned the rules do not change, but it's still lots of time wasted. Those are kids that do not learn to clean up at home. The ones who do not hear the word no at home are a whole other (and worse) cup of tea, but it often goes hand in hand. \n\nKudos to you for raising your kids not to make the job of others they encounter difficult!", "NTA.

Lol\n\nSister is going to seriously regret not teaching her kids responsibility and how to be self sufficient. And 6 is plenty old enough for that lesson.

It made me a self sufficient adult. These are basic skills. NTA.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you taught Martha how to handle a potentially dangerous mess (sharp shards) safely (shoes and with tools, not with your hands), while supervising and doing most of the work.\n\nMartha learned agency and responsibility, and that while accidents happen and we don't cry over spilt milk, we do clean up the mess in front of us before we go get more.\n\nYour sister will figure this out.\nMy guess is she feels like her parenting was implicitly criticized because \"if she'd been doing her job Martha would already have known this\" (not what you said, but what she's imagining you thought.)\n\nWhen in reality, parenting is a learning curve. Being HUMAN is a learning curve. And if we help each other (big or small) figure out what to do with messy mistakes, the world gets better for all of us.", "NTA, you taught her proper caution, supervised and modeled for her. I wish I had relatives like you!!", "NTA. I feel your sister had a knee jerk reaction to, \u201cmy baby, glass, hot liquid.\u201d And unleashed mama bear. And honestly she likely knows that you\u2019re right at this point and her pride is carrying this on. You can either chose to admit it just to put it to rest and have it over with or wait for her to get over it which may take a little longer but she will get over it. She should be grateful her daughter has such a great aunt that will take time with her teach her these important skills and make memories with her.", "Wow, does your sister always overreact in such a weird way? I'm embarrassed for her. Six years old is not too young to learn, and I bet your niece was proud of her accomplishment.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. you handled that perfectly.

You didn\u2019t put her in danger. Your sister is overreacting. And you taught Martha a valuable lesson about fixing mistakes.", "Of course not, you were teaching her skills she will need in the future and the fact that she took initiative to clean up the second mess shows she didn\u2019t mind cleaning up and wanted to be helpful, your sister was out of line", "NTA, she's mad that you're a better parent.", "NTA, I am going to admit I would not have done this, but I am not mad at it.

I think this is how everyone should handle kids making messes, by teaching them how to correctly clean it instead of just yelling at them and doing it yourself. Because the next time they make a mess, they\u2019ll know what to do instead of just freaking out because they\u2019re about to be in trouble.", "NTA\n\nProperly supervised, this sounds entirely reasonable. I worked with children for almost 25 years, so I have some idea. \n\nMy class of 6-7 year olds often cleaned up their messy crafting activities. They all knew how to use a dustpan and brush, which means that they wouldn\u2019t be touching anything potentially sharp. The only exception I would make would be cleaning anything potentially causing contamination.\n\nIn teacher training, I visited one award winning technology school where 4 year olds were able to saw and hammer nails into softwood which they had been taught to do safely, so they could do this with minimal supervision. It was amazing.", "NTA\n\nYour sister should have been proud of Martha. Exclaimed how proud she was of her.", "Oh my effing gawd!!! Is your sister for real?! I bet your niece felt kind of proud for learning a new task\u2026 she did a grown-up thing.", "NTA and teachers everywhere thank you.", "NTA\n\nYou were teaching Martha an important life lesson and you did it really well in an age appropriate way.  You didn't yell at her (no need to - accidents happen) and you showed her what needed doing to fix what had happened and got her to help you.

And most importantly, you did it in a safe manner so she wasn't harmed (cut herself).", "NTA.\n\nReally the perfect response to a small mishap gets your sister so riled up? Don't let her guilt trip and bully you.

I actually call my child over if I notice something dangerous, to have a chat about it. A couple of weeks ago I broke a mason jar, and used one large shard to show my kid what broken glass looks like and to be careful... we also talked about what to do if it drops on the floor (I broke it in the sink). I've also pointed out dangerous berries, sharp barbed wires on a fence, stuff like that while we're out walking. Children learn by example and have little concept of danger unless you explain things. I'd rather spend the time showing them how to be careful, than to have to bring them to the hospital with a sliced foot or poisoning later on.", "NTA, you're teaching responsibility. Your sister is being ridiculous, her child wasn't in danger.", "This will last until the next time she needs you to look after Martha! \nNTA", "Nope, the earlier the better or you will have one lazy kid. You did everything right, you taught her. Good for you!", "NTA You just taught your niece a good skill and responsibility.", "NTA\n\nYou set a great example as your niece learned that accidents still need to cleaned up.\n\nAlso you made sure she was safe in watching how you got all the shards picked up then helped with her child sized mop. \n\nYour sister is wrong and I suspect unless she has many other babysitting options you won\u2019t be denied long. \n\nIf you are,then you may need to come up with an apology but let your sister know you will still follow your own house rules in your home.", "Your sister is a horrible parent and it will come back to bite her in the ass.

You didn't but Martha in danger, you taught her how to clean up her own mess.  You helped her, and you didn't punish or shame her.  And she was very receptive to the notion of self-efficacy in being able to deal with the consequences of an accident.  Hooray for you!  Good mothering (or aunting, as it were).\n\nYou did nothing wrong and everything right.  It would be interesting for your sister to write out exactly what was dangerous about Martha learning to mop.

The only A here is the sister. She is making a rod for her own back. My children did simple, age appropriate chores at six.

I remember repairing a hole in the drywall for my daughter, while my four month old granddaughter \u201chelped\u201d next to me.
