This is a hot debate, and every time I see it, people assume chicken water is flying everywhere (everyone I know who washes meat is meticulous about the process, and properly disinfects their sinks, counters, etc, afterward). This is very common in non-western countries, so that\u2019s something to be aware of. Things like grocery store chicken legs can sometimes have a slime, trace amounts of blood, small feathers, etc, that can be rinsed away (cooking the food gets rid of the bacteria, but washing meat isn\u2019t about bacteria, it\u2019s mostly about that slime, which is why it\u2019s often washed with vinegar or lemon to cut the slimy smell and taste).
