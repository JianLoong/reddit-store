The USDA says not to wash meat because doing so can spread pathogens.  But maybe check with her on where her mom grew up.  Maybe they didn't have the same food safety laws.  And depending on how old her mom is maybe she grew up at a time where it was a good idea.", "NTA and it doesn't sound like you were making fun of her. Washing meat actually spreads more bacteria, unless you're also giving the sink a good scrub each time with something disposable. And cooking your food kills whatever bacteria is on it.\n\nIf she wants to have this hangup about her food, fine, but she's got no business forcing it on you. Sounds like cooking might not be the best of activities to share.", "Yeah, don't wash raw chicken, it's just gonna splatter all over with germs.\n\nJust cook it properly.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nI don't see how you were making fun of her. You were simply asking if her mother washes ground meat. Talking about washing meat, it's a pretty common way to spread the bacteria from the chicken.", "NTA. Washing meat can actually be worse for food contamination.", "NTA - only because I think washing meat is gross and unnecessary though.", "NTA. Your friend is a dummy and so is her mom. A quick google search will tell you how washing chicken is unhygienic and not recommended by any food safety organizations.", "NTA. this friend of yours really needs to start accepting the truth about why washing meat before cooking is redundant.", "NTA. You do NOT wash meat prior to cooking, ESPECIALLY not chicken! This spreads the bacteria around the kitchen sink & counters and everywhere!\nSend your friend on a food safety course.\nEdit: changed GF to friend", "[deleted]", "Um, isn\u2019t it generally recommended to NOT wash meat - especially chicken? Because pathogens can be spread?\n\nNTA.", "NAH - but some cultures wash their meat. If you're not going to respect it then just don't eat it. Also the best chicken I had was from someone who washed it before hand, and I didn't get sick either so. I'm not going to be a rude guest and not eat their food because they do something I don't think they should do.", "I don't care if I get down voted into oblivion for this, but we are not washing away bacteria. We're washing away grime, dirt, feathers, blood, etc. that accumulates through processing animals, and that simply heating won't get rid of. It's a cultural thing, and millions of us across many different cultures have been doing it for centuries with no issues. Clean your kitchen, and you won't have any issues either.", "I think its a cultural thing as we used to do in my household when I was little, I still wash meat by habit and yes I know what the USDA said and I myself are a pharmacist but I tend to wash it because it still have some blood and feathers and I think it\u2019s disgusting, I clean my sink with disinfectant and I don\u2019t shake the meat everywhere and we never had food poisoning growing up, my dad has a farm and we use to clean the chickens prior the waiting rigor mortis and all the post mortem transformation. I don\u2019t get how you could contaminate your kitchen if you don\u2019t shake the meat everywhere. I have lot of habits to avoid cross contamination like having different recipients for meat and raw vegetables. I\u2019m very attached to the washing meat stuff not to eliminate pathogen cause it\u2019s not the case but clean the surface from blood or other stuff and to remove the raw smell with lemon and vinegar and it add more flavour in my opinion. I would say not TA but you should not laugh about stuff you don\u2019t know the what or why people are doing something.", "YTA. You\u2019re not supposed to wash chicken but making fun of her makes you an aashole.", "ESH could\u2019ve sent some food safety links to her instead of being an AH about it.", "INFO: Do you often explain the right way to do things to her? Something tells me you do.", "can i ask everyone in the comments when you say \u201cwashing chicken\u201d what exactly do you guys mean ? because i clean my chicken with lemon juice and vinegar, you don\u2019t run it under hot water that\u2019s not washing chicken & no i\u2019m not gonna stop. (please don\u2019t comment usda guidelines cuz i don\u2019t gaf, i\u2019m not gonna stop, y\u2019all listening to what the USDA has say when they literally be wrong, they said mcdonalds burgers are 100% beef but i watched a video of a man who sat a mcdonalds burger out for an entire year and the meat didn\u2019t rot or anything the burger looked exactly the same as when he bought it. so miss me with that usda shit PLEASE).", "ground meat doesnt get washed thats common knowledge ??? edit as in like youre not supposed to wash it", "YTA. \n\nYa you don't need to wash meat, but so long as she cleans the sink after, it is a harmless practice. \n\nWhat isn't a harmless practice is making fun of someone, and their mom, because they do something differently then you. \n\nThis is the definition of a moo point- a cow's opinion, no one cares about it. Wash your meat, don't wash your meat, doesn't matter, but what does matter is attempting to be a decent human, and here you failed.", "[deleted]", "Idc what nb say im washing the meat", "OP, When you say \u201cwash raw chicken\u201d what does that involve?", "YTA. You're right, but you don't have to be a dink about it.", "[deleted]", "I am sorry but you sound like a dick. There are still split opinions on whether to wash meat or not. The problem is not whether the meat is being washed before it is packed but during the time in the package - ideal breeding ground for salmonella bacteria. Some say washing actually spreads the salmonella more than it is cleaning it. Others say it is necessary to keep the bacteria away from the surfaces such as cutting boards which can contaminate your cooked food. Independent from that it is always wise to wash packed meat, as it is sitting in this really disgusting juice which slowly escaped the meat. I would not want that in my food. \nBack to your situation. The way you are making fun of her is not very friend like. She is doing what she learned from her mum. And with the hygiene standards back then it was really normal to do it (salmonella poisoning wasn\u2019t unusual either). Things improved since then as we have now better cooling chains and quite strict standards with food. However, I think you acted like an A H and that she is not wrong for doing what she does. It might not be necessary but it is definitely better than never washing your meat. YTA\nEdited to correct typos.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you're grossed out by the juices, pat the chicken down with a paper towel that'll also help with searing the meat. \n\nAlso, I think correcting sub-par hygiene standards is what a good friend should do.
