{"id": 14677, "submission_id": "12keqcv", "title": "AITA for asking my friend to leave my house after telling him he could stay for 2 weeks?", "selftext": "My friend Joe (39M) got divorced last July. He began couch crashing with friends and recently asked me if he can stay with my husband (39M) and I (38F) for a bit. I told him he could stay 2 weeks but then had to find another place. He's unemployed and doesn't seem to be trying to find a job like most people would in his situation. I'm 5 months pregnant and have already converted my 2nd bedroom into a nursery which was super clean and has everything practically set up so not much spare space. Before he came on Tuesday night, I told him not to bring a bunch of stuff into my house and to keep it to a suitcase or two. He agreed and said he'd be dropping his stuff at his storage unit before coming over. Well he gets here last night and has an SUV packed full of stuff that he carries into the house (tons of clothing, power tools and god knows what else) and brings it into the room so now it's packed full of stuff & it smells too - so there goes my clean nursery. \n\nI've been sleeping on my couch bc it's more comfortable for my back right now and am woken up at 5:30am as he's leaving the house to go see some girl. He leaves, doesn't lock the door (we live in a major city where it's not safe to do this), then comes back an hour and a half later & calls me because he didn't take the key I gave him. From lack of sleep, I was exhausted all day at work. Then tonight he finally gets home with even more stuff and tells me his car broke down (so he can't bring it to the storage unit) and he needs to shower. He leaves it all in my living room then I hear him in the shower blowing snot rockets which grossed me the hell out and leaves his soaking wet towel bunched up on my toilet. He walked out naked with only his hand over his junk and when my husband yelled at him he acted like it's no big deal bc I was downstairs. He comes downstairs at 10pm to say he's going out to hook up and will be home late. So now it'll be another night that he's going to wake me up in the middle of the night so I'll be exhausted at work again. \n\nI get I'm not his mom and he's an adult but if you're staying at someone's house wouldn't you be a tad more respectful or maybe I'm just being an asshole who isnt used to having someone here but my husband. I look in the room and theres dirty glasses on my new furniture and dirty clothes on my new lazyboy. This is how he's been in 24 hours and I don't think I can have this for two weeks. I know my husband is annoyed and left the house today to get away for a bit. I want to ask him to leave but I know he doesn't have anywhere to go. AITA?

Just because he\u2019s your friend doesn\u2019t mean he can be disrespectful and take advantage of you. You\u2019re pregnant and don\u2019t need that stress. It\u2019s not your problem that he has nowhere to go. He can get himself a no tell motel room if needed. He\u2019s been couch surfing since July of 2022?!? 9 months is plenty of time to get your business together.", "NTA \nI\u2019m seeing why he is in the middle of a divorce. You would not be an AH for kicking him out, he is being absolutely disrespectful of your home and, by extension, you. \nIf you want to give him one more chance,then you and your husband need to sit him down and be extremely clear and explicit about what your expectations are. This is including when he needs to leave and that he needs to get his stuff out asap (he\u2019s not working so he should be able to do this in a day, tell him to rent a uhaul if needed). Remind him you are doing him a huge favor because you consider him a friend and he is in a bad spot, but that this is your home and if he can\u2019t respect it he will no longer be welcome. \n\nAlso - double check what the squatters rights rules are in your area, you don\u2019t want him staying so long that you can\u2019t kick him out without an eviction.", "NTA -- I got angry on your behalf just reading this! \n\nGET THIS MAN AND HIS STUFF OUT OF YOUR HOME, ASAP. You do NOT owe courtesy to people who disrespect you and your home!\n\nIs your husband annoyed at you, or at the friend? Either way, you're not the A -- and if your husband takes his friend's side, then both of them are the A's here.", "Woah bro, please kick him out. He\u2019s disrespectful and you\u2019re well within your rights to send him away", "NTA. Don\u2019t bite the hand that feeds. If I were in his position I\u2019d try to make as little impact as possible, I\u2019d do everything I could to help around the house and make everything as easy on you guys as possible. He\u2019s essentially treating you as a B&B. You need to re-align expectations otherwise it will only get worse.", "NTA. Tell him you\u2019re sorry but he can\u2019t stay. It isn\u2019t working out for you. End of story. (Also probably end of friendship but from the sound of things it is what it is.)", "NTA\n\nI'd lay down the law and tell him exactly why you are booting him. He sounds like he plans on staying - forever.", "NTA He is a discourteous houseguest. I wouldn't bet on him leaving when he is supposed to either. Good luck getting him out at all, much less early.", "NTA\n\nI would be doing your dishes, buying groceries, or at the bare minimum meet your requests and keep clean. He is disrespectful and needs to be confronted. Just keep it civil and establish some boundaries (that he will most likely not agree with) then kick him out if he disagrees. But keep in mind that you have to talk with your husband first, and make sure you guys are on the same page before you do anything. You don't wanna kick him out just for your husband to defend the guy and bring him back.", "NTA, kick him out. He already ignored your rules as soon as he dragged all of his stuff into your nursery. He seems to be incredibly comfortable with inconveniencing others, entitled and spoiled. Don't allow yourself to take on the role of his mother. Houseguests that don't respect their hosts should be kicked to the curb.", "NTA. He hasn't even been there for a full day and he is already taking advantage of your kindness. It will only get worse from here on out. Kick him out.", "NTA\nYour house, your rules and in this case you are being very reasonable :)", "NTA - it's your home, and you should feel safe and comfortable in it.\n\nI do get the impression that you and your husband didn't really establish firm ground rules that this friend has to adhere to as a guest in your house, so maybe (re)establish these.\n\nWhatever the case, you are in your full right to revoke your invitation for him to stay.", "NTA. Make it clear to him that he disrespected you from day 1 when he brought stuff over you asked him not to and has been disrespectful since. Tell him he needs to leave. Now. Don't relent on this or he'll stay forever if he can.", "If you gave him a key and he can't figure out where it is, he's got to find that key before he can come inside again.\n\nAlso: you should change your locks.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You have no obligation to cater to a grown man\u2019s booty calls and to have your nursery turned into a storage unit. You were already being nice enough letting him stay for two weeks.", "NTA based on what you described", "NTA, this behaviour is why he doesn't have a place. Before I read his age I thought his age was 19-23 not almost 40, Jordan Peterson says \"a 30 year old infant is an ugly thing\"", "NTA , congrats on the upcoming baby.", "NTA. Get rid of him now, he has already abused your hospitality and any one of his foul habits or behaviour he has demonstrated would be enough for me to kick him out. If he has nowhere to go that's on him, not you. You may want to talk to him and give him a warning but I'd definitely be demanding he get rid of his stuff to his storage unit. TBH I would never have let him into the place the moment he started bringing excess belongings. Let's be honest, he disrespected you and your home the moment he walked through the door. Let him stay in his storage unit.", "NTA Tell him to clean up his act now or he is out.", "Obviously you're NTA. Is there not a shelter in the area you live in? I would do him one last kindness and drive him there, then cease all contact. As has been done to me in the past lol.", "NTA.  You better do something quick before two weeks turns into six months, and then two years later, you have to hire a lawyer to evict him.", "NTA. Get him out before he sets up a residence.", "NTA kick him out now", "NTA. He's basically 40 and has the manners of a pig. No wonder he's getting divorced. Kick him out of your house ASAP. You're doing him a favor and he has no idea how to behave in a civilized way.", "ESH. YTA to yourself for letting him live there in the first place. \n\nKick him out a.s.a.p. and don't feel bad about it.", "NTA. It was nice of you to offer your friend a place to stay but if it's not working out for you for the reasons that you mentioned, let him know that he cannot stay in your house anymore. It seems like he overstepped some basic boundaries and has been disrespectful towards you. You have other priorities at the moment and you shouldn't be in a situation that annoys and stresses you out.", "NTA! Like you say, all this has happened within 24 hours so you don't even want to know what he'd put you through for two entire weeks. You're pregnant and you need to look after yourself and baby, that is a priority. I hope your husband is supportive of this and you can both have a talk with him and tell him he needs to go - He is a big boy and can find alternative arrangements.", "He can go stay with his hookup. Or a motel. Or sheep in his broken vehicle. Just not with *you*. \n\nNext time he rolls through, you and your husband sit him down and tell him he has  *one* more night.\n\nI don\u2019t know how his marriage ended, but if he was this way with his wife, no wonder the marriage ended.

I really hope my next post on here won't be \"AITA for burning down my home because someone won't vacate.\" He's stayed at other people's places the last few months and hasn't done this. I honestly don't think he would but now a part of me is paranoid.", "I was just thinking that (reason for divorce). Other than defecating outside of the toilet, I'm struggling to think of a way he could be a worse houseguest.\n\nNTA.", "No, my husband isn't really mad at me. He's annoyed because he thought this could happen and that I'm always too nice to people and told me to stop doing it. He's mainly just pissed at our friend. I should have listened to him when he said it may not be a good idea but the thought of a friend being homeless broke my heart so really I'm the idiot in all this.", "And tell him now before he really settles in!", "We didn't. That was our mistake. We've had friends stay before and it was never an issue as they were super respectful and acted like guests and not as if they've been living here for 10 years. We had a good friend stay for months and never had a single problem.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates [Rule 1: Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

This will make getting rid of the friend easier if your husband is on your side.\n\nOne thing to be careful about: Depending on where you live, if you let someone crash at your place for too long, they're considered a TENANT, with rights, and you have to formally evict them! So check the laws in your area -- and in any case, get this guy out ASAP.\n\nAND THEN CHANGE YOUR LOCKS! Better safe than sorry.", "NTA\n\nI mean, there are some things that are just common sense and common decency. Waking up your hosts in the middle of the night, leaving a mess in the bathroom, and walking around nekkid are just rude and inconsiderate.\n\nTell him **today** that this isn't working out and he has to leave. Don't give him two weeks or till next weekend or a month or whatever. Don't give him a chance to clean up his act (he won't). He's a grown man who's had nine months to get his act together. His number one priority should have been getting a job so he can secure housing, not \"hooking up\". His lack of having nowhere to go is **not** your responsibility - don't make it yours! \n\nIf he really has no way to get a place to live then he can live in his car or go to a shelter."]}
