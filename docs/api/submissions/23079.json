Everything went well when we first introduced ourselves and the conversation we nice. The issues started when he tried making \"jokes\" about how I made a good \"spicy\" woman for him.

Both of us went outside and I decided to cook this plan. You see, I look very... stereotypical latino. But more the gang kind.

He looked straight up paper white, nodded and soon left with my daughter.\n\nWell, I was later telling my wife this and we were both cracking up about it but my youngest heard us and said what I did was very wrong to our community for \"feeding the stereotypes\".

I hope he shit his pants.", "NTA.  This is the time to run that guy off.  Crisis averted, even if not yet appreciated.", "NTA,\nI\u2019m laughing my so hard right now. The fianc\u00e9 sound like a nightmare\u2026 you may pay for it but totally worth it imo.", "NTA - if my dad did this, I may be mad for a bit, but later in life would look back and laugh. \n\n1) the fact he believed that stereotype prob says more about him than you. To me, it reminds me more of the \"I have a shotgun - remember that\" threat that most dads (to various degrees of joking) do. But I'm also not Latino, so I can't give a full opinion anyway on the \"stereotype\" aspect. \n\n2) the fact he ran at first dad threat says a lot! How hard is it to respect your daughter? He wouldn't be \"in trouble\" if he just respects her more. And running scared first thing? Naw, not for me. \n\n3) comments like what he was saying are HUGE red flags, especially in today's day-n-age. \n\nI say good job dad.", "NTA is my official vote. Was what you did kind of an asshole move? Yeah. Was it warranted? Oh, absolutely. Are the people saying it feeds the stereotype wrong? No. Did your actions nonetheless have a net positive impact on the world? Yes.", "NTA, He was blatantly disrespecting you infront of your daughter and almost rubbing it in your face by inappropriately touching her in front of you. Threatening his life may have not been the best idea but I think you should have a discussion with your daughter on why you don't think he is a good fit for her at all and that she can do better.  \nThink about it from your daughters perspective if she hears that \"Something dad said\" resulted in a break and she has no clue what you said it makes it look like you sabotaged the relationship and she doesn't even understand why you said what you said or what you even said. It's better to clear up that confusion as soon as possible in my opinion.", "We really need a \"justified AH\" voting option.", "Soft YTA  \nBut...  Part of me wants to buy you a beer. I'm a Dad, and I'm also VERY protective of my daughter.    \n\n\nHowever, I would have had a conversation with HER, and not the \"boyfriend\".  This becomes a matter of respect, not protection.    \n\n\nYou daughter deserves to be with someone who loves and respects her, and boyfriend was *very disrespectful,*  but you do her a disservice by stepping in and not allowing her to handle it.   \n\n\nYou're obviously a good dad, and your heart was in the right place. It's the execution (pardon the insinuated pun) that could have been done better.", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s always fun and games until someone games back, huh? \n\nIf that\u2019s all it took to have him running for the hills- he must have some bad habits, or really believe in what he was saying, huh? Either way hasta. \n\nWhile I do get what your younger daughter meant by stereotypes- the boyfriend was playing into all them already- so he obviously already had his own preconceived notions. \n\nMaybe he was joking- maybe not. Either way, the line has been drawn and he\u2019s at least aware that his behavior is unacceptable. \n\nPersonally, if he calls off the engagement, she dodged a giant sized sexiest, potentially racist, bullet.", "\u2026and then everyone clapped. (This sounds very fake)", "NTA\n\nAny creep that thinks those types of things, much less says them out loud, deserves to be run off. And your daughter is far better off without him. \n\nI think you did the right thing. Normally I\u2019d say people need to handle their own business, so she really should have been the one to tell him off, but something is going on that has made her fail to see reality - that he\u2019s a prejudiced, misogynistic AH and she deserves so much more. \n\nI realize not every woman would feel as I do, and that may be especially true of the younger generations, but I say here it was justified.", "ESH.  This guy sounds like a walking red flag, and I hope she is able to see that asap.  But the way you handled him really does suck.  Your youngest is correct--you perpetuated more negative stereotypes and you made what sound like actual threats (even if you were just bs-ing).  You could have set him straight on his misogyny and racism, but instead you just reinforced his idea that women are weak and only deserve respect when it's out of fear for what their dads will do to them if they mistreat them.\n\nMaybe you should have an honest talk with your daughter and fess up before that asshole tells her, and she takes his side because of your foolishness.  You need to fess up and explain why you did it. You had very valid reasons to be concerned, but you screwed up  and you need to admit that.", "ESH Look, the fiance is obviously a racist, misogynistic asshole but your response was the equivalent of those dudes who take pictures of themselves waving a shotgun at their daughter's prom date. Did it ever occur to you to have a private conversation with your daughter and ask her why she thinks it's okay to let her fiance disrespect her like that?", "You\u2019re are a good dad for protecting your daughter from a lifetime of wifely servitude this asshole of a fianc\u00e9 was offering. \n\nAbsolutely NTA", "NTA\n\nPerfect dad response.", "Ahahaha, ok. Normally I would 100% not be ok with a dad giving. Shovel talk, but WOW is that dude an AH. Dad of the fuckin year, nta.\n\nWe need an acronym for when it goes beyond \"nta\" and becomes \"you're the bad ass\"", "YTA sadly. \n\nMuch like this sounds funny if it were in a sitcom, your youngest daughter's quite right, you are feeding the stereotypes. And you're eldest daughter has every right to be absolutely furious. You could have destroyed her engagement. \n\nMind you her fiance sounds like a thoroughly racist AH. So maybe you ultimately did the right thing. Good riddance to him. Try to explain this to your daughter.", "I'm going to respond, having highly suspended by disbelief, to say YTA. If you have concerns, you tell your daughter and let her handle it. You don't take matters into your hands. She's old enough to take care of it.", "Ehhhh I understand what you did but YTA.\n\nYes. It\u2019s clear your daughter\u2019s fianc\u00e9e seems like a sexist and racist jerk. I would rightly be concerned. But the correct way to account for this would be to 1) call his behavior out directly 2) talk to your daughter about your concerns. \n\nIt\u2019s amazing your kids have a great future you\u2019ve provided them but it\u2019s likely better to not trade in stereotypes or threaten violence, real or imagined, to take care of them.", "Esh the better way to go is talk to your daughter about the kind of treatment she believes she deserves and why.", "YTA you threatened to kill someone.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We do need help in life, no matter how independent we are or are capable of being.  \n\n\nI would like to think of myself as being a good pop.

If that idiot only understands stereotypes, so be it.
