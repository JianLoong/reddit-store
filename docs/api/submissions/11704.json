And that further, you expect THEM to apologize for the misunderstanding and explain that or YOU will be sending out a mass email (and/or similar social media note or equivalent) along the lines of: \n\n\"We're so terribly sorry but there seems to have been a misunderstanding and miscommunication. In their excitement about the wedding, it seems that \\[in-laws\\] have accidentally suggested to a great many people that they were invited to the wedding.

But I guess the fiance has a say in this, so of course, you both need to talk.", "NTA\u2026call off the wedding. Have a simple ceremony with just your closest people. If they want a big party, they can throw one\u2026.on their own money!!", "Tell them either they pay for their guests or the wedding is off and then do a small service with your parents and your spouse and don't invite them.  I'm currently planning my wedding and my parents wanted to invite about 20 people (out of 150 total) to the wedding, but they are paying for 1/3 of the cost.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey cannot make these demands and then expect you to foot the bill. NTA", "NTA- sounds like your fiances family might be desi (apologies if not, i mean no offense). The \"brides family should pay\" is an old and outdated tradition in my opinion. They sound like the type of family to ask for a dowry too. You need to get your fiance in line and uninvite people or get them to foot the bill. no wedding is worth going into a huge amount of debt over. Also it sounds like its spiraling and will no longer be a wedding youre happy with", "NTA.\n\nElope now.", "NTA, and your fianc\u00e9 should get involved to deal with his parents instead of making it your problem. He should tell them strictly that only people you and him invited yourself are really invited. If they can't be trusted to follow the rules, change a venue and don't tell them where the wedding will take place. I don't mean invite them, but send a driver for them instead, for example, or ask a family member to pick them up.", "NTA but also elope....invite your nearest and dearest and just do it.", "NTA and this sounds like my nightmare. If more people keep getting invited, I\u2019d think about a courthouse wedding and then maybe having a party (if it gets out of hand).", "NTA\u2026of course they are big fans of tradition, because the brides family pays.  I would only invite who you originally wanted to.  I would tell the fianc\u00e9 if he is ok with going along with his parents because it is cultural or whatever, he can pay for the extra.  But you are not going into any more debt.  Be firm and set your boundaries.", "NTA at all OP.\n\nNot to be extreme, but you should go ahead and cancel the wedding for now. It'll dishonor the grooms family and bla bla bla, but guess what, that doesn't concern you and they invited all these people without your permission. \n\nI was livid on your behalf after reading that you're out another 10-15k, that's no joke.\n\nSo postpone the wedding, get your money back if possible, and sit down with your Fiancee to discuss if you guys can get on the same page again.\n\nI'm guessing this might be an arab/desi wedding but I'm not too sure.", "I mean, you really should have put your foot down when they first started inviting people and said then and there that if they were going to do that they would be responsible for the costs. We had to do the same thing with my MIL.  You aren't wrong to all for the money, but for the future, you need to nip this behavior in the bud when they start overstepping, but let them overstep then demand they fix it later. \n\n\nAlso, if you didn't invite these people, as in you never sent them a wedding invite, then you have your fiance's family uninvited them and tell them they will have to explain that they didn't take the budget into Aviv when they were inviting every person they've ever run into (also something we had to make more mother in law do).  But if you did hand over the invitations because your in laws said these relatives wouldn't be coming, then this is partially on you got not stopping it sooner.", "NTA - LOL, we dealt with the same thing on a smaller scale.  My husband and I paid for our own wedding 100%. One day, my MIL asked us for \"extra invitations.\" We were like \"Why?\" Well turns out she wanted to invite some distant relatives and some business associates of FIL's who were *nothing* to us - we sure as heck didn't want them at our wedding.\n\nSo, we said, \"Well, MIL, you can have the extra invitations if you give us $70 cash up front for each person you're inviting. We'll happily refund you for anyone who declines.\"\n\nWell, ends up it all of a sudden wasn't so critical that those guests be there when it was on her dime...", "NTA - LOL, we dealt with the same thing on a smaller scale.

They get two choices: uninvite the people you didn't approve or pay for them.", "You have a lot more to figure out in your relationship than just wedding planning. Your fianc\u00e9 prioritizing his family over you should be a huge red flag. A wedding is just one day, raising children, owning a home, caring for ill family members is for years. NTA", "NTA.

Do not go into debt for this.\n\nWe are so excited and feel fulfilled getting engaged, planning a wedding...but what if the negative issues w this wedding are an example of how your life will be?\n\nIs that a life you want?\n\nForced into debt bc your in-laws decide to over rule your choices and decisions for your life?\n\nThis doesn't get better.", "In his defense, she says her parents have been doing this too.", "When hubby and I were planning, my family was fine. His mostly was but we had some issues and FIL tried to play the \"we want to give you money and then you come to us and we decide if we want to pay that bill\" card. We shut that down fast. Well turns out that almost 4 years later, they are still bitter that we turned their \"generous gift\" down. I told hubby, \"if it was genuinely about helping us, they could have gifted us that money. But they didn't. Because it was more about public recognition and wanting to be seen as a big shot.\" \nMy parents were like \"Here is a check, use it however and tell us what you used it for.\""]}
