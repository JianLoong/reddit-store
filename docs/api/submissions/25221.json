Recently, we were visiting my husband's parents along with his older brother, his younger brother and his wife, and their kids. My husband's older brother recently went through a divorce. \n\nMy husband and I know his ex-wife quite well because she is also our coworker. We've talked to her about their divorce, and without going into too much detail, she felt that he was being more and more of a douche to her and was less interested in showing her or their kids love. Knowing my brother-in-law, this tracks. \n\nWhile we were visiting my husband's family, after the kids and his parents went to bed, we were watching Family Feud. I don't remember the prompt, but one of the guys answering said \"eat the cat\" (i.e. eating pussy) as the response to whatever the question was, and Steve Harvey made that \"what the fuck did you just say\" look that he seems contractually obliged to make each episode. \n\nMy husband's younger brother made a joke about how, based on their expressions, some of the people on the show didn't look like they ate pussy very well. My husband then said something that was basically both a bit of a (frankly, warranted) brag and, more prominently, a comment that any worthwhile spouse should strive to be good at giving their wife oral and should do it often. \n\nNow, my husband can definitely be a rather haughty man in a handful of ways, though sadly that is balanced by pretty severe self-loathing and insecurity in other ways. And honestly, he's only really like that about things he is genuinely good at, so while I get that it can be annoying for some people, he's not exactly wrong about what he's a little proud of himself for. \n\nMy husband's older brother's response was to say \"obviously you think that, you don't even have a dick to use.\" My husband has a micropenis and has always been extremely sensitive about it, and his brother knew this, so this was an incredibly low blow. My husband started to tear up and then went to the room we were staying in without a word.\n\nI told his older brother that he was a giant douchebag who should shut the fuck up, he then told me to fuck off and go ahead \"pretending you don't mind,\" then I told him that I could see why his wife left him, and maybe if he weren't such a prick he'd still be married. Obviously, that made him pretty mad, he told me I was being a \"monumental fucking bitch\" and I went to our room to comfort my husband. \n\nI recognize that the wife comment might have been a low blow (although so was the dick comment from him), so AITA?", "created_utc": 1692676186, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15xtz9r/aita_for_telling_my_brotherinlaw_that_his_exwife/", "score": 35, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
