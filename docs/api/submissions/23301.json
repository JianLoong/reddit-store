It\u2019s not always a convenient manner. An Uber, a walk, a taxi, an officer would probably let them sleep in a drunk tank, get a hotel for the night, etc etc. \n\nIf anything your friend was taking advantage of what had been your generosity up to that point. They wanted a babysitter, the government is about to remind them they\u2019re adults.", "NTA\n\nfirst, YOU didn't risk their lives, HE did. he's an adult. and, he made his choice. he CHOSE to drive drunk. you didn't say....listen, just get in your car and drive......and force him. so, this is 100% on him. \n\nyour friends that are saying it's your fault....they're morons. period. so is your buddy.", "NTA. You warned him beforehand, and he got drunk anyway. Dude has a drinking problem, and he got his rude awakening. Except I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll learn his lesson if he\u2019s blaming you for his drunk driving.", "NTA\n\nIf you're gonna drink, you need to have your ride covered. Your friend dismissed what you said and then attempted to guilt you in to doing it. \n\nAny friends or family siding with them isn't worth your time. Tell them to get fucked.\n\nAlso, your friend is now a drunk driver, which would be enough for me to never talk to them again.\n\nHE risked their lives. The fact people aren't seeing it that way is absolutely bonkers.", "NTA his choice his responsibilities and as far as you knew you weren't unleashing a drunk driver he was getting an uber.\n\nBut INFO, was this in NYC?? You mention borough and \"in the city\" and I haven't heard borough used for another American city and the city is what everyone calls Manhattan. I'm honestly FLABBERGASTED that this would happen in a city that has: endless ubers, 24/7 transit and frankly, unless he was swerving everywhere on the road I'm stunned he got pulled over for a DUI. To the point where if you only have his word on it I would absolutely fact-check it.", "Absolutely NTA!  He's a fucking adult and is responsible for his own actions!  You didn't throw keys in his hands and shove him into his car!  You gave him prior warning, he said he was good.  Anything after that is 100% on him.  Screw anyone who thinks otherwise!", "NTA. It\u2019s NYC. He can get a damn Uber. \n\nAnd what about the girlfriend\u2014she can\u2019t call an Uber? She gets gets into the car and goes along! No one looking at her?", "NTA, and all the people who think you were being petty for \"risking their lives\" is a complete moron. Your friend is presumably not a child, despite his actions, you had told him HE chose to drive home. I don't know how anyone would take the side of someone who is going to drink and drive.", "NTA - He's responsible for his life.  You are responsible for yours.  You made it very clear what your boundaries were.  You should not sweat this for a moment, and you should not take any grief from your peers about it.", "NTA. You warned him, he chose to ignore your warning, and he had to face consequences.", "INFO are they also blaming his girlfriend? He said he had it covered. He needs to control his drinking.", "It\u2019s horrible to drive drunk, but in a roundabout way, it\u2019s a good thing that he got caught and he will be taught a lesson.", "NTA. You didn't risk their lives he did. Why couldn't the girlfriend drive? And of course their is Uber or Lyft. It is not your problem the two of them couldn't figure out how to get home.", "NTA is he spinning this story to other ppl in a way that isn\u2019t accurate cuz how can they be so dense to think it\u2019s ur fault.", "I thought for a second you knew he would drive himself home which would make this more complicated but if you thought he was calling an uber clear NTA.  he's responsible for himself", "NTA - There's been a rise in \"won't drive drunk people home\" posts, and while safety is essential, being taken advantage of as the sober friend is frustrating. I've distanced myself from friends who only seem to have fun when drunk, as it feels like they're using me. I won't be a free cab or babysitter for those who don't value my presence unless they're intoxicated. Setting boundaries is crucial, and genuine friendship shouldn't rely on alcohol.", "NTA the only person who put their lives at risk was your friend who chose to drink and drive. Hopefully this will be the wake up call he needs", "NTA\n\nHe needs to start calling the \"friends and family\" when he gets drunk and needs a ride. Why should it always be your job? Especially in NY when he could easily take a train or car service.", "Unless you were holding a gun to their heads, NTA. They chose to drink too much.", "NTA. Who wants to be a driver all the time? Not me", "NTA, but I\u2019m also confused. Is he primarily coming to your city versus you going to his? Is that why you feel guilted into paying his Uber? Otherwise, most responsible adults would figure out and pay for their own way home. \n\nFor all those that are blaming you- this dude is an adult, who makes choices including how much to drink, and whether he should drive home at night. If he can\u2019t afford an Uber, he needed to make other choices to get himself back safe.  The safe well-being of other adults isn\u2019t solely in your hands. And his girlfriend also makes her own choice whether to get into his car after drinking, or taking an Uber home.", "NTA. He's an adult and responsible for his own decisions", "NTA - but stop hanging out with this friend.  He has shown that he has poor judgment and a history of taking advantage of your kindness. When he's caught misbehaving- instead of owning up to his wrongdoing- he's calling in the flying monkeys.", "I say, if he pulls this every time you go out with him, then don't go out with him,", "NTA. It was made clear at the beginning of the evening that you would not be driving them home. He chose to lie to you and then he risked their lives, not you. If what you've said in the story is the full truth, then 100% NTA.", "NTA\n\nKudos to you for giving your friend a lesson in boundaries and sticking to them. He got an F (around and find out) on the pop quiz. Maybe he will do better on the next test before it becomes the final exam.", "NTA. He coulda used Uber, public transpo, a cab, or called a tow truck (a friend of mine used to pull his fuel pump relay if he got drunk, get towed home and fix it in the morning). Or he could have not gotten drunk.", "This is one of those situations where yea you kind of are the asshole. But also not. \nYou are the asshole because you knew he was drunk. He asked you for a ride home and you told him no. Drunk people have never made smart choices. \nYou should have put your feelings aside for the night and just took him home. You not only risked his girlfriend life but also someone else\u2019s. If he would have wrecked that car and ran into someone he could\u2019ve killed them. And just think it could\u2019ve been a mother coming home from a late night shift back to her loving family. \nHe really could\u2019ve hurt someone and you were aware of his impairment. So that makes you the asshole. \n\nBut you aren\u2019t the asshole either because your friend is indeed a grown up and should take responsibility of his actions. You most certainly don\u2019t need to be paying his legal fees. He messed up big time. And now it\u2019s a hard lesson he is going to have to learn. \n\nBut next time just take him home and then maybe idk not go out with him again.", "ESH, your friend should not have put you in such a position, but you also should not have allowed your friend to risk the lives of others. I lost someone close to a drunk driver. We share the road you need to put your own issues aside and look at the bigger picture. You could have done it this last time then never hung out with him again, and tried to get him the help he needs if this is common. \n\nWe all have a responsibility to do what is right letting someone risk others loves because it is an inconvenience for us in the moment is 100% selfish.", "YTA imo. I get your frustration trust me but I think you should\u2019ve gave them a ride then the next morning let him have it. As much as it\u2019s annoying that\u2019s your friend and you left him in a vulnerable position.", "ESH. You went out with your friend who you know to be dishonest and irresponsible, but you took their word that their drunk self was going to spend money on an Uber.

Driving without a front license plate, overly tinted windows, and speeding.

Then later tackle the moment.

At some point he needs a wake up call.", "Have to agree with this, you have a moral obligation to be mindful in such situations.

What would have happened if they went out and you weren't there? Are your friends and family gonna blame you then??

You aren't responsible for their stupidity.", "You thought you could trust him to take an Uber like he said he would. If he did and you had his keys it's harder for him to pick up his car the next day when sober, why would you do that when you thought you could trust him? Trusting someone isn't willful ignorance, that would be more if he was telling you he didn't have a way to get home and you blew him off.", "He\u2019ll get it together, after his second DUI and lengthy license suspension/jail time.

I could have done something but chose not to.", "I personally think one DUI should mean an automatic suspension for a decade. That would certainly be a deterrent.", "Indeed. I do get for many it is uncomfortable to feel like they have to be mindful of an adult friends action. Sadly drunk driving is no joke, and sometimes really the only thing that could have prevented an issue from happening is a friend putting their foot down and doing what is right. \n\nIt does suck for the OP I hope he finds peace also.
