Don't say big sister and muddy the waters more.\n\nIf you don't have a bond with her and were just doing it as a favor to Max, then just cut ties now and be done with it all.", "Max relied too heavily on you and needs to accept the boundaries you have set now. Life changes, it\u2019s fluid. You\u2019re at a different point than you were when you had more time to help. Your job is demanding, you\u2019re creating a new life with your fianc\u00e9 as you\u2019ve moved in together, and have a high risk pregnancy. All of these factors create an extreme amount of stress. You set a boundary for your health and it needs to be respected as you\u2019re going through transitions in life. Take care of yourself and your health!", "NTA. You have a medical conurbation quite frankly is life threatening. Max is more upset about explaining this to his daughter than the fact that his dear friend has a high risk pregnancy? He\u2019s a jerk. I do think you can explain this situation to Ava yourself so she understands, but Max should have been more understanding of your situation and asked if *you* needed anything.", "NTA , OP. You\u2019re her Dad\u2019s FRIEND (an honorary Aunt), not even biologically related to him, and you\u2019re certainly not her Mom. You shouldn\u2019t feel like you even need to ask this question, in my opinion. Your priority is your life, health and family - not Max\u2019s. This reads to me as he\u2019s used you as an unpaid babysitter? I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s totally true or not, but it definitely seems like he expects you to prioritize him and Ava over yourself, fianc\u00e9, and unborn baby. Add to that the fact that your pregnancy is high risk? Yeah, SO MUCH NTA OP. He\u2019s definitely the A  Hole for not accepting your \u201cno\u201d and trying to push. No means no. \n\nI\u2019d be careful that he doesn\u2019t just drop her off without warning, though - if he\u2019s not respecting your \u201cno\u201d now, he will probably try to force the issue and you may open your door to the bell or a knock and find Ava there. He has other friends that I\u2019m sure can step in and help him out, it\u2019s not your responsibility. \n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nYou are not responsible for Ava. You offered help--help is not the same as taking on a parental role. Max should have known you likely wouldn't be able to offer help forever.", "ESH\nYou made a commitment to a child for selfish reasons without thinking of the long term. \nMax is holding you to an unrealistic promise.\nYou obviously need to focus on your family but the moral thing to do would be to find a middle ground and still be an important figure in her life. Max needs to be more realistic, but he is trying to protect his child's emotional wellbeing albeit not well.", "\"Auntie OP is having a baby and she needs to rest lots and be extra careful right now, so we aren't going to see her as much for a while.\"\n\nBing bang boom. This isn't about \"abandoning\" Ava or \"having to explain this to her\", Max is just pissy that he's lost free childcare.\n\nNTA", "NTA but explain it to Ava and maybe you can FaceTime regularly so she still gets your company", "INFO\n\nCan you describe how involved you were in this kids life and for how long? Imo this is crucial information.", "I know I'm going against the grain, but I do think it's traumatizing for a 6-year old to suddenly be cut off from the only mother figure she's ever known. This is obviously not entirely your fault and you're entitled to your own life. But it sounds like her dad did check with you if you were in for the long haul and you assured him you were. I hope you're able to taper off rather than abruptly halting involvement. (Seeing her in social situations doesn't count.) So, because you had assured Max of your continued involvement in her life and are stopping abruptly, soft YTA.", "Unpopular opinion but YTA.  You voluntarily stepped into this girls life and were voluntarily heavily involved.   You need to realize children aren't tools or toys and you need to nicely let this girl down in a way she can understand why you won't be around as much.", "YTA. You agreed to be a part of this little girl's life and you are now heartlessly abandoning her. I'm not saying that you have to co-parent the kid, but to involve yourself so heavily when you were interested, and then drop her when you find something better to do is despicable. You can take a step back, but you should be the one communicating this to Ava. Relationships children have with their support system is different from adult relationships- you chose to get involved, she  didn't get a choice and hasn't done anything to deserve this, other than exisiting.", "NTA but - as others have pointed out - there are ways to handle this delicately without hurting Ava. No one is suggesting that you shouldn\u2019t prioritise your health and your family, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you go nuclear on your existing relationships. \n\nAt the end of the day, you chose to be a responsible adult in the life of this kid. Yes, you\u2019ve had shifting priorities, but she wouldn\u2019t be punished for Max taking advantage of your time and energy. Your past crush on him is totally immaterial at this point. She\u2019s not old enough to understand the nuances - all she would see would be her auntie rejecting her. \n\nSee if you can video chat with her once a week or so. Send her a letter or a postcard, or record a video message saying hi. It doesn\u2019t have to be much, but if you\u2019ve started off being a good person in her life, then it would be worthwhile to continue the effort.", "NTA. I would have said just let her know that it's going to be hard to see her for awhile, and keep in contact by phone. Now I'm thinking you may need to start slowly going nc with them. If max can call you names because your health is at risk, he is not someone you should be friends with. He sounds like he owns you, and that is not a good thing.", "NTA for setting boundaries but you were TA for using a child as a means to be close to your crush. That's weirdo behavior.\n\nYou got close to his child and helped him with her and now you are trying to building your own family and have decided to step back from her. Ava is 6 and imagine how she views the situation. \"Aunty is pregnant now and has no time for me.\" It doesn't really matter that your health should take priority and you are doing the right thing for you and your unborn child. Ava will feel hurt regardless and it's partly your fault. You made yourself a pivotal point in her life.\n\nSince you won't have time for her for the remainder of your pregnancy and probably after your child is born I think you should consider not being close with Ava anymore.\n\nI mean... you don't have to babysit her but regular calls to her on the phone never crossed your mind? You could arrange to talk with her once a week or something. Twice a month? If you aren't willing to do that then cut contact cold turkey.", "Yep and with Max\u2019s frankly weird sense of entitlement to OP\u2019s support, good chance he will spin this unkindly", "Ava is her family, though. As soon as OP decided to help, she became a fixture in Ava's life. She acknowledged Ava as a responsibility. \n\nOP, if you are planning on permanently reducing your role in Ava's life, YWBTA. You are not her mom, but you are an important female influence. And it is most likely that the connection she has with you is as close as she can have a relationship with a non biological female caregiver.", "Auntie and her baby are sick right now. She would love to see you, but she needs to stay home and rest until she feels better.", "Yes, I wish this response were the top.  OP made a conscious choice to be a trusted and caring adult presence in this child\u2019s life.  Disappearing without having a conversation with the child would be devastating.  I hope OP explains the situation to her chosen niece and maintains some kind of presence in her life.  Otherwise she\u2019s TA.", "She was using the child to try and get her way, too\u2026", "It didn't even seem to cross her mind. That she could maintain contact with Ava video telephone call or video chat. Makes me doubt her care for Ava.", "OP does sound cold. This situation should not have gone that far for so long. No way is a child going to understand this mess", "this is exactly right. \n\nbig yta", "That definitely stuck out to me. OP basically used being this kid's very involved auntie hoping to score points with her crush. That's an ahole move because now the kid is losing her auntie because auntie moved on from her crush. She isn't a little baby anymore who isn't going to remember OP wasn't around anyone.", "Btw NTA :)", "How would she be an asshole for reducing time or role? That's a parenting problem. Just because someone helps you out does not mean that becomes a permanent fixture.  \n  \nOP has done a lot already and needs to focus on herself, her child and her soon to be growing family. You sound like a Max.", "That could work.", "And she did it with ulterior motives, her interest in her father. Gross.", "This should be the top comment.  Why isn't he supporting OP in her time of need when she helped him in his time of need?", "Agree. He and Ava can make trips for short visits, and the helping suggestion is great. Do kinda get the feeling though that OP is not actually attached to child. So maybe between visits can get longer to ease child getting use to no \u201cAunt\u201d. Firmly Max\u2019s time to put extra effort in", "THIS right here!!!", "At first, but not for the majority of the kid\u2019s life.", "I think so too. Gross"]}
