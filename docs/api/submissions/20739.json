I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s totally true or not, but it definitely seems like he expects you to prioritize him and Ava over yourself, fianc\u00e9, and unborn baby.

But the key difference here is that while we\u2019re sad to see our nanny go, we\u2019re also happy that she\u2019s taken that step forward in her life. She\u2019s been a part of our family and we\u2019re proud she\u2019s smashing out her goals for her future. We don\u2019t tell our daughter she\u2019s been abandoned.", "NTA \n\nYou have had to adjust your life for the one in your belly. That is a big thing for your health and the baby\u2019s.

You and max being a couple is no longer a possibility , you have a family now ( fianc\u00e9 + baby on the way) , you have a more demanding job, you live further away.

He\u2019s not mad at you, he\u2019s just stressing out and taking out his emotions on you. It\u2019s going to be harder for him , but that\u2019s life. I do want to say, since he didn\u2019t bring this up, it would have been better for you to bring this up ; that your level of commitment will be changing . That way he could prepare mentally + financially better, perhaps? He was essentially replying on you as the second parent, and boundaries probably should have been better established .", "Not the asshole, Ava nice day", "Lots of single dads like to pawn off their kids on any available woman.

He still sucks for helping create this situation.\n\nOP you created this situation. YOU made yourself a fixture in this child's life. YOU are the one emotionally abandoning them. They are 6, will they get over or past it? maybe will they have trouble forming trust in new people due to feelings of abandonment, probably.", "NTA. Your friend's expectations are unrealistic. You have your own life to prioritize too.", "YTA for getting involved with this girl\u2019s life because you had a little crush on her dad. Your N.T.A. for focusing on your baby, but you are abandoning the relationship you had with her.", "NTA", "YTA  \n\nI have read a lot from people saying that the dad is just demanding free babysitting services and she is doing this out of concern for her health.  I do not buy it, I think that the father is thinking of his daughter's feelings, and how he is now stuck trying to explain your sudden departure from his little girl's life.   I think she is doing it because she now has a baby of her own on the way and just wants to be free of Ava.  The statement I will see Ava socially so it's not like I am cutting her out of my life.  Total bull, if you did not happen to share a friend group that is exactly what you would be doing.   \n\nThe way I see it, you fostered the relationship with Ava from a very young age.  Anyone on here with any sense knows that she did not start calling you aunt on her own.  You referred to yourself as her aunt over and over.  That is why she calls you aunt because she thinks you love her and you are her aunt.  When you do that to a child, to me you are taking on a responsibility to be that child's aunt for the rest of her life. \n\nMy daughter had a friend when she was in high school, who had kids young.  My family and I got involved in their lives and they came to see us as their family.  They call my husband and I aunt and uncle (even though we play more of a grandparent role).  My daughter and this girl are no longer friends.  However, our family even my daughter, are still very active with the children.  We truly love them and the idea of just abandoning that relationship will never be an option for us.  If we did not want them to be a part of our lives forever, we would have never fostered the relationship in the first place.  If and when my own children have children it will not lessen the love and commitment we have for the ones we have chosen to be our family. \n\n You do not at all feel bad about abandoning her.  I work a lot of long hours and sometimes only get to see the babies mentioned above once a month.  We Facetime all the time and will meet up to just grab some ice cream.  I will have their mother bring them over for a visit, and she will stay to help out while they visit.  That way we at least get to see them and they know we are still here and we love them.   Long story short, if you wanted to still have Ava in your life you would find a way excuses be damned.", "YTA For making yourself into a maternal figure because you had a crush. That\u2019s fucked up", "That\u2019s too much for a 6 year old.  Ava doesn\u2019t need to know about crush on daddy and moving on. All OP needs to tell Ava is she still cares about her but that she won\u2019t be around as much as she needs a lot of rest and lives far away with her husband. \n\nCutting her off completely would be cruel (excluding group meetups,) if she was really present beforehand, so maybe a slower release is better.

When I was younger, I had a very kind babysitter. She was super gentle and amazing with children. She got pregnant and moved away for her husband\u2019s job. I was sad at first, but also happy for her. \n\nIt\u2019s very common for adults to come and go in the lives of children.

It's not that hard and kids aren't that dumb) or fuck up her health bc change is difficult and confusing so better to just not change?", ".... She said Max said she was essentially abandoning her, not that she was planning on abandoning her...", "NTA.

Not your daughter. You did your best and right now you need to focus on yourself and your pregnancy.", "NTA. But I would make a point to still communicate with Ava and let her know that you still care, but the doctor says you need more rest.

A way for her to personally explain to Ava instead of leaving the dad high and dry to carry that burden.

Problem is \u2026 op never was and never will be Ava\u2019s mom.\n\nEdit: now that I think about it more, op should have kept boundaries when hanging out Ava - she basically was much more than an Aunty to Ava - but is not taking the easy way out by stating that she is pregnant/ engaged.\n\nstill think Max is the biggest as* here, he should have allowed Ava to keep a relationship with op which was feasible for the long term.

That can be kind of exausting.", "NTA. Situations like this where there's an almost substitute parent in the picture always get messy.", "My problem is I think people are making a lot of assumptions about the depth and extent of her involvement prior.

Like, what is she supposed to do? She has a high risk pregnancy, her fiance lives far away, and Ava is at an age that requires a high level of supervision. \n\nShe never pretended to be Ava's mom. I don't know what people's relationships are like with their aunts, but my  aunts/uncles (but related and not) certainly ebbed and flowed in my life. They had kids! They moved for jobs! They stopped being friends with my parents! Some of these things moved in the opposite direction and we become closer. As long as this is explained in a thoughtful way, and Ava is supported, she will adjust.

I love them, care about them, and spend time with them when  I visit. Some of their other aunts/uncles have stronger or less strong relationships.

Ava will probably miss OP while she is bedrest but it won\u2019t be like losing a mom.", "The other party is not responsible for the child's well being as long as she stays out of her life. By choosing to become involved, she is at least responsible to not leave the child in a worse state than she found her which means being careful and considerate about how she decides to exit Ava's life.
