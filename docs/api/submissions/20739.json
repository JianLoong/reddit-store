I do not care for Max, you had a crush >you moved on >your priorities changed accordingly, that' s okay. However the girl sees you as part of her family almost, and she was used to hanging out with you, if you stop it so suddenly she will be heartbroken and very confused so at least talk with her about it, assure her you still love her etc... I think that would be in place...\n\nUnless you of course didn't really love her in the first place and did not take the whole thing just as a chore from the beginning \ud83d\ude43 in which case you obviously would not have to care", "NTA and Max has a hell of a nerve trying to make you out to be the bad guy here!  You are experiencing a high risk pregnancy- WTF does he think - that you should put your self and baby at risk for his convenience? \nHe can suck it up and find daycare.", "NTA.\n\nYou're not abandoning her, you're prioritizing the health of your own unborn child, and yourself--as you should be doing.\n\nExplaining such a thing to a six-year-old is probably very difficult, so I can understand having some problems there, but it sounds a little like Max is angry not to have free childcare anymore.", "NTA. If you're doing someone a favor, you're not an AH for no longer being able or willing to do the favor. He has been inconvenienced, not wronged, and the inconvenience is his own, not yours.", "It seems more like you're right-sizing your time spent with Max and Ava to be a more appropriate fit with your actual relationship with them. \n\nRelationships change over time, it should be no surprise to Max that you're living your own life and that involves a significant other and children of your own. Did Max think you'd always hang around as a sort of surrogate mom for Ava?\n\nNTA", "NTA, but there is a difference between being unable to physically care for an active child when you are busy/have medical issues and not maintaining any relationship at all.\n\nIn your shoes, I'd probably offer to video chat with her (which at her age, could be you on a video call with her while she shows you the drawing she made that day or watching while she plays with her toys and occasionally explains how to play). That way, she doesn't feel like she lost you from her life, you get to maintain a relationship with a little girl you clearly care about, and you set the stage for your child to have an older \"cousin\" (which you might really appreciate once Ava is old enough to babysit)", "She isn't your child.  Sounds like he was using you as a babysitter/substitute parent.\n\nHe then tried to guilt you into going back on your statement.\n\nNTA", "NTA. If you can't do it, then don't.", "NTA. Situations like this where there's an almost substitute parent in the picture always get messy.", "NTA but it sounds like Max takes advantage of you.", "NTA, but I\u2019d be sure to take some time to explain to Ava that you\u2019re having a baby and that means you won\u2019t be spending as much time in person together and offer to FaceTime or do something else to stay connected. It\u2019s important that you prioritize your family, but Ava should also be supported through this change and cutting her out of your life completely would be a big scary change for her with no context. \n\nMatt is definitely the asshole though for trying to get free childcare from you because you had a crush on him.", "If Max can't find someone else who can take care of his daughter that's on him, not you. You aren't a nanny or a sitter, just a friend who has a life of their own and if he can't see that then shame on him.

Ava knows you are not her mother, and while she is young, she is not too young to understand that you are having your own child and that child will take time and attention away from her.  \n\nThis is the same dynamic that goes on in families with multiple siblings that have children at different times in their lives.  Once your own child comes along, there is just not the time to devote to the nieces and nephews that you once had.", "So, Max is more concerned about who's gonna babysit his kid than supporting your life decisions.  You may want to re-evaluate how much he truly values you as a friend. NTA.", "NTA\nYou are currently physically incapable of caring for Ava. Max is an AH and ungrateful for not caring about the health of you and your child after the years you've spent helping him with his.", "INFO - was max aware of your romantic interest in him?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just me, but I feel like agreeing to be be big part of a child\u2019s life because you have a crush on their Dad. It sounds like your involvement in her life started with you trying to use a baby. Pulling back from that arrangement is what makes you the AH, but how and why you got into do make you the AH. You owe it to Max (and your fianc\u00e9) to come clean about how your relationship with this child began. If max already knew and was taking advantage of your crush for free child care then he\u2019s the AH, too.", "NAH. A single parent miffed their childcare just changed?

How much of a friend is he? How much does he put himself forward for you? Is it a two-way relationship? Would be a great time to peruse it critically and decide how close you really are.\n\nNTA", "NTA but agree that you should try to keep some contact with Ava. However, you are not her mom, stepmom, biological relative or next door neighbor. Sometimes people come in and out of our lives and that's ok.

You are the only \"mom\" figure she's ever known.  BUT don't let Max take advantage either.  Ultimately this is his daughter and his responsibility.

Even if you can't be physically present, she would probably love to receive cards or trinkets from you so she knows you're thinking about her.", "I was thinking the same - Ava is going to have no idea what is going on.  Send her a little card every so often so she knows you are still thinking of her - does not have to be regular but just to say hi, how are you", "Guilt-tripping a woman who helped him for years and is only stopping because she physically can't continue is what makes Max an AH.", "There are decent ways to handle disappointment and asshole ways.
