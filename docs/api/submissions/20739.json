However the girl sees you as part of her family almost, and she was used to hanging out with you, if you stop it so suddenly she will be heartbroken and very confused so at least talk with her about it, assure her you still love her etc...

If you're doing someone a favor, you're not an AH for no longer being able or willing to do the favor.

It\u2019s important that you prioritize your family, but Ava should also be supported through this change and cutting her out of your life completely would be a big scary change for her with no context. \n\nMatt is definitely the asshole though for trying to get free childcare from you because you had a crush on him.", "If Max can't find someone else who can take care of his daughter that's on him, not you.

Would be a great time to peruse it critically and decide how close you really are.\n\nNTA", "NTA but agree that you should try to keep some contact with Ava. However, you are not her mom, stepmom, biological relative or next door neighbor. Sometimes people come in and out of our lives and that's ok.

You are the only \"mom\" figure she's ever known.  BUT don't let Max take advantage either.  Ultimately this is his daughter and his responsibility.

Like for example if you go from seeing her twice a week to once every one or two months, that would be a huge change for her, and since you made the decision to be a big part of her life YWBTA imo.\n\nI definitely think you should talk to her about why you can\u2019t see her as much atm, that you\u2019re pregnant and that it\u2019s high risk.

You got on to a path that was not good.\n\nYou have a family of your own. That comes first with Ava a distant second. When you have your own baby life changes and changes fast. Your baby will come first, then your husband and then Ava. See... Ava will soon disapear of the screen.\n\nPrep Max for the inevatable. Tell him to get a wife or baby sitter for Ava.", "ESH.  You made a promise because of your attraction to her parent.  That is not something you should have done lightly.  A child having adults disappear out of their life or greatly reducing contact leaves a kid with abandonment issues.  You are allowed to focus on your family, but that 6 year-old will be hurt by your actions.  Can you facetime her so she does not feel completely abandoned and replaced by your child?  Boy, she is going to hurt a lot over that.", "INFO\n\nWhen you say reduce the number of times you see her, how much are you reducing it by? If it is half of or even a quarter of the amount of time that you spent with her before, you're Not TA. But based on your comment about \"not cutting her out of your life,\" it seems like you will only see her \"sometimes socially.\" If that is the case, then you're very much the AH for dropping the kid like a hot potato, a kid who has already been abdandoned by her mother and who didn't choose to have you in her life but who probably got attached to you anyway because that's what kids do. You'd be the AH if you don't ease out of her life slowly with plenty of reassurance that she is still loved and will be a part of your life after the baby (however small) and if you left the single dad to clear your mess all by himself.", "It really shouldn't be too hard to explain to a 6 year old that auntie isn't feeling very good and can't get around much right now. She still loves Ava and misses seeing her but her health just isn't permitting her to get out a lot at this time. Yes, she is going to be sad etc. and might need to hear it more than once to remind her that this is still going on. You can call, video chat, whatever regularly so she knows you aren't just abandoning her. Max shouldn't expect you to live your life around him and his daughter.

And wow what and AH move to abandon a child who will only see this as you getting your 'real' kid and now she is not am important. Can you not do video chats or something? You just cut cold turkey? You are going to still work on some projects. And you will see her sometimes within the friend group.

That is a shitty thing to do", "This is against the grain, but having been in Ava\u2019s position, YTA. At least a tentative one.

She is absolutely allowed to change her mind, but that also doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t absolutely suck for this little girl to be abandoned not only by her mom but now by OP. \n\nOP- if you ever really cared for Ava, let Ava know you still care, and that work and new baby are adult things that are taking time away but doesn\u2019t mean you care any less.", "YTA You created a situation where a child saw you like a mother and now you want to give her back.

Your health and the health of your baby comes first.  Period.  You're not abandoning Ava.  There's a perfectly good, medical explanation for why you're not able to spend time with her right now.  And Max is her father.  It's literally HIS JOB to explain things like this to her, and he's being a massive AH to expect you to put yourself or your baby at risk just so he won't have to have an upsetting conversation with his daughter.", "NTA\n\nHowever you have been a \"psychological\" relative to Ava for all of her life and she is understandably going to feel abandoned if you suddenly cut off contact.\n\nAs others have suggested, you should speak to her in a way that she can understand that you are not able to physically be with her as often right now but that your feelings for her haven't changed. I am assuming that you actually do care for her.\n\nYou obviously don't have to play the part of a babysitter for her as it appears you have but if you still \"love\" her, you can assume the role of an aunt. My niece lived distant so I didn't see her that often but I spoke to her and sent her \"care baskets\" for various holidays like Halloween, Easter and Valentines Day.

Yes, he is also TA for expecting you to parent Ava while you are ill with pregnancy, but I think you absolutely set yourself up for that one with your previous actions.  \n\nThe only one who hasn't done anything wrong here is Ava & I feel for her because you have both created this unsustainable situation that will set her up for disappointment & heartache.  \n\nI mean, let's face it, once you have your baby, you will not be able to provide her the support & time you used to.  Children are time & energy sinks & the one that is yours is always going to come before everything else.  \n\nI would start trying to prepare Ava, Max & yourself for that, so that it isn't a sudden & wildly traumatic event when it happens.", "NTA but have a talk with the little one in person. Who knows what he'd say to make you look bad.", "This right here. Please make an effort to FaceTime this little girl. She has depended on you and there are ways to maintain that connection", "This - even a video chat once in a while will help.

He can't drop her off so he's telling her you abandoned her?  Why can't he come over with his daughter to help out and show her what a good supportive friend does?", "Exactly, don't take these decisions on a whim, particularly over a \"crush\".

And the line between handling desperation and asshole is quite close.", "Still think that he's gone too far, but I'll grant you that I didn't consider that it might be desperation and that does make me consider it from another angle about why he it got to that level", "You can see him going through the stages of grief:\n\nAnger - Calling OP AH\n\nBargaining - Negotiate drop off\n\nDepression - How is he gonna tell Ava?\n\nDenial - Probably his initial reaction. \n\nHopefully acceptance is him realizing Ava has a lil cousin & he can repay the babysitting from time to time."]}
