Whether he did or not is immaterial. Even if he didn't than it would mean the inheritance and benefits the OP gets would have been greatly reduced.\n\nI would be interested to know any long term financial responsibilities you have that do not benefit you. There are plenty of kids in terrible situations you can offer to pay for their upbringing, I doubt you will be turned down, and get a contract agreeing to do it for the next 18 years.\n\nAlthough I sure you are one of those who say others should do stuff they wouldn't dream of doing.", "I agree, since I have seen this often where I live", "Sounds like mom was on drugs and CPS did a shit job in evaluating the home.", "A very similar place, with about 100 less disposable income per week. This guy doesnt even support one child half of the time. Where is your compassion man?", "Ok, despite your profile, i absolutely refuse to believe that you are a woman, as the way you speak reeks of male privelledge. Regardless, op isnt even 100% his kid! The parents share custody! If ops mum is so irresponsible, the absolute least the dad could do is take on his sone full time", "I read that too and I agree that she is vile. I feel bad for all her children.", "All I was doing was asking mochi if they believed what they themself typed. If she should of lied more to get support. Thanks for your paragraph but you didn't need to reply of their behalf.", "Sounds like you are arguing according to the slippery slope fallacy. Buying something for a kid now doesn\u2019t obligate him to still be doing it 18 years for now, especially if his financial situation or obligations change.", "Sounds like you are arguing according to the slippery slope fallacy. Buying something for a kid now doesn\u2019t obligate him to still be doing it 18 years from now, especially if his financial situation or obligations change. I don\u2019t think anyone here was saying he should have taken full responsibility for raising all the other kids.", "There's also the cases of men who wound up being slapped with the, \"fatherly role\" argument in situations of cohabitation for a period of time, or men who were separated, but not divorced, from their wives at the time of conception & birth and therefore not the father biologically speaking, but the courts didn't care.", "I have compassion, I also face reality.

Honestly I think there should be an automatic DNA test when putting someone name on a birth certificate. It would cut through all the dramatic bs.", "Youve never fucking met her? Even if she did do that he could just stop supporting her, its not that hard to do seeing as thats already what hes doing", "That second one is what I recall, and I must have skim read it the first time because I just realised it\u2019s not girlfriends and wives who post that are more likely to be voted TA, but OPs posting *about* girlfriends and wives. I appreciate you linking, although it doesn\u2019t really change anything I said except to say people are posting trying to prove this sub is misandristic instead of misogynistic, and are failing either way because all the posts that mirror each other so far are given the exact same ruling every time, no matter how many times the genders are changed.", "This sub is heavily biased. Mostly regarding sahm. If you perfectly mirror the post you will mostly get the same results in the end but the split is different. So instead of 90% NTA you get 70 % for example. If a post isn't clear cut you will notice the differences way more. \n\nAnd the fury some people exhibit here is way higher if the op is a man. \"unfortunately I have to say YTA\" is something you won't see if op is a man.

Men asking making posts and asking for a verdict for worse behaviour and not making posts for more benign behaviour\n2. Men are simply worse people \n3. Women only ask for a verdict when it's pretty clear they are in the right\n4. This subreddit is frickin' misandristic\n\nI personally think it is number 4; but the general consensus if that misandry is imaginary not unlike the easter bunny. Yet in every single post you see roughly 20% alluding to the husband/boyfriend etc. showing his misogyny as a reason for his behaviour. But when a wife/girflriend shows really shitty behaviour towards her spouse it's simply \"bad behaviour\".  \n\n\nOur mind has a tendency to soak up this narrative and I think most of you genuinely don't realize being a man comes with it's own particular package of very shitty cards you are being dealt simply because of your gender.  \n\n\nI don't have enough data to proof my hypothesis; but to blatantly deny it's happening while the underlying data suggests there is a BIG EXCLAMATION MARK that demands to be solved before any man can feel confident in getting a just verdict in this forum is beyond ludicrous....and frankly a little misandristic..."]}
