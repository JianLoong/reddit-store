If you are struggling to pay your bills AND are unable to be in a monogamous relationship, then make your partner wear a condom and get on the pill. Your freedom completely disappears when you have a child. That's what's happening in this post. \n\nYour need for sexual satisfaction does not supersede biology. I don't have a single problem with monogamy or polyamory, as long as consent is apparent. I have a huge problem with those who choose to be free sexually and not have any obligation to be a good caregiver. OP's mom clearly didn't care. Not because of the infidelity, but having 5 kids with 5 different men, and then blaming the only parent that shows up for their biological kid is disgusting. \n\nWhy not the other 4 kids' mom? Why not blame your own actions and those of your other 4 partners? If mom wanted 5 kids, then why not know who the dads are? Answer is easy, Mom didn't want them, but she was too ignorant or complacent to do anything about it. Now Mom has her kids fighting amongst themselves over what's fair/right. When the reality is that if Mom or any of the dads cared, then they would be there. Mom doesn't care. The kids will always think OPs dad is the asshole, and OP and her dad have to be the asshole in a situation that neither of them have caused.\n\nDo not get me wrong, I'm not advocating for celibacy. I am advocating for freedom with the acknowledgment of consequences. If you want to have a bunch of unprotected sex with strangers, go for it. However, make sure you're protected, have a doctor you trust, and acknowledge that even if you're on the pill/IUD and/or always use condoms that accidents happen. Every time you have a sexual encounter, you can have a child. Idc how safe you are. It's just a fact of life. Vasectomies don't even work 100 percent of the time. Don't make excuses. Don't blame others. Most of us participate in sex, so be proactive about your choices. If you don't even want the remote possibility of having a kid, then you either have to be OK with contraception and/or ok with an abortion. Otherwise, celibacy is your only option.
