Almost all people who get pregnant while on birth control is due to them missing days.", "Facts I got pregnant on birth control twice so I snipped my tubes cause I want to ensure I have no more kids than the two I have", "> and the deadbeat dads too, I think\n\nAt least one of the dads (specifically the dad of the half sibling who is mad) shouldn\u2019t really be called a deadbeat. \n\nHe had a one night stand with someone and then went about his life. Not knowing that you have a kid that needs support is not the same as knowingly not supporting your kid. \n\nWe don\u2019t know the situation with the other dads, but the blame for half-sisters situation is 100% on her mom. She is the one who broke up her marriage. She is the one who had unprotected sex with a stranger and didn\u2019t bother to get his name or exchange contact info. This is all on her.", "Or mom just sucks. I have a coworker with 8 kids from 7 different mothers, that he knows about, he admits there's probably more he was never told about. Why? Because he's a dirt bag in that aspect, won't get himself snipped and won't wear condoms, there's nothing deeper going on with him other than he likes to fuck irresponsibly, maybe OPs mum is the same way.\n\nThe only saving grace my coworker has is he works hard to provide for all of the kids he's been told about, so he's not a deadbeat, just gross and really easy.", "Just because BC can fail OCCASIONALLY doesn\u2019t mean it shouldn\u2019t be used! It\u2019s like saying \u201coh I don\u2019t need to wear PPE gear to do dangerous work because there\u2019s less than 5% chance my equipment is defective and won\u2019t work\u201d \n\nLike it completely floors me that so many women don\u2019t know about different types of birth control and their pros and cons.", "I think it\u2019s actually 6 with 6?", "You don\u2019t know that for a fact though, and no matter what the stats are, its not 100%, most people who ended up not keeping their children were on birth control, whether they missed a day or not, people believe that if there on it, it won\u2019t happen and that\u2019s so not true, people need to know it could happen anyway and since it\u2019s a serious thing to happen, people need to think twice before doing it if its something that\u2019s just 100% not an option for them.", "To be fair, and yes this is definitely an unpopular opinion, people going out having sex willy nilly should *always* assume a child can be made. I get it though, sex is fun for some people and who wants to worry about those pesky consequences \ud83e\udd37\n\nUnfortunately, women (and the children born as a result) who opt for one night stands really will be the one left with the responsibility.  Women actually get more say about what happens to a pregnancy and therefore should take more responsibility (another unpopular opinion). \n\nAll that to say I agree, the mom is the AH here.", "> people going out having sex willy nilly should always assume a child can be made\n\nYeah, and the people who might actually have to spend 9 months with that child inside of them should be the ones making sure they actually know how to track down the people they let nut inside them.", "> Women actually get more say about what happens to a pregnancy and therefore should take more responsibility (another unpopular opinion).\n\nFinally, someone claims to have an unpopular opinion and it really is one! And as a bonus it\u2019s not just plain offensive to anyone with half a teaspoon of empathy. Rare! Chapeau. \n\nThat being said I disagree, of course :) Medically speaking, pregnancy is a medical condition so all decisions are up to the patient. Just like with any other conditions, no one can make the decisions for an adult, conscious patient unless specifically authorized. It would be wild if the person you had any other accident with suddenly gets a vote on your treatment plan. Of course you are right that the woman is left with the responsibility - which is the main reason why in average women already take more responsibility for contraception. Should they (morally)? Not really, imo both are equally morally responsible for the outcome. But consequences are not distributed equally hence the difference"]}
