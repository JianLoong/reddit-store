My dad filed for divorce and established through the courts that he was not the father of my half sister and fought not to have parental responsibility of her. My dad did get shared custody of me and because of shared custody did not have to pay child support. My half sister's bio father was unknown and while mom did try to find him, was unsuccessful. My mom went on to have four more kids with four different guys. My dad continued to take care of me but never took them on. When dad knew mom was struggling he would make sure I was taken care of at her house since CPS and the courts did not believe things were bad enough for me to live with him primarily. So I was always better taken care of than my siblings.\n\nMy half siblings all hate my dad and I believe a large part of that is due to mom telling them stuff all through the years. When I was about 13 mom tried to poison me against dad by telling me how dad let them suffer, how he fought to reject my half sister, how he was often mean to her about them when she would talk to him.

I told her I didn't see what my dad did as wrong because he was never her dad. She said he could have been but he rejected her in court. I told her again that to me, dad did nothing wrong.\n\nShe called me an asshole. Said as her older brother I should be furious that he would be okay with her and the rest of our siblings going hungry, not having the right care, and that he could have stepped up but chose not to which should make me hate him.

Maybe she should take a look at her mother, the one who kept having children she couldn't afford with random people she couldn't even find afterwards to tell the kids who they were.

Yes.  Was he obligated to do so?  Of course not.\n\nBut both you and your halfs are seeing only have the picture.  For you, your dad was always there for you and it was your mom that cheated.  \n\nFor your half siblings, they see that he helped only you even though they had unmet needs as well.  And your dad actively chose not to take care of them (via court and via some of the purchased).  And, I suspect, they have been told a different version of how the split between your parents happened.  And they saw you getting things they never got; emotional and material.  \n\nYes he could have helped the other kids more.  So could have the other dads.  So could the neighbors.  So could your mom.
