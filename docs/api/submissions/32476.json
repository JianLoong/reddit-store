I have 2 sons (13yo twins) and 1 daughter (11). He has 1 daughter (13). We do weekend stays together twice a month so far and there's never been any major issues honestly. The girls have gotten in to a few petty arguments but other than that, no big problems. I spend around $1000 a month in food and that covers me and my kids + Jack and his daughter for the two visits a month. I do a lot of meal prep and couponing. \n\nLast month my mother asked me and my kids to go to her place in Louisiana to help her move out of her home and into a 50+ community. It made me feel more comfortable to have my house occupied in my absence to keep the dehumidifiers and everything running (huge moisture issues and I don't want anything to mold or rust) so I asked Jack if he and his daughter wanted to stay at my place for 2 weeks in our absence to keep everything running smoothly. I gave it a 2 week time frame but was unsure of how long it would actually take. I knew the drive alone would be 2 days there and 2 days back. He agreed. I did my monthly shop before leaving and spent $1,092. I told them they could have some of my food when we were gone so maybe this is my fault. \n\nBut anyways, we got back 2 days ago (4 days before the 2 week mark) and found my house in ruin, practically. Dirty dishes on the counters and table, dirty clothes throughout the living room and bedrooms (mine and my daughters- where they slept). I keep my house clean so this caused a lot of panic on my end (grew up in a hoarder house so I take pride in a clean home). But the one thing that truly tipped me over the edge was finding that they went through at least 90% of the food I bought before leaving, in less than 2 weeks. We were left with a single pack of hamburger, all the veggies and a few boxes of pasta. Jack started scrambling when we entered the home, saying \"sorry, I was gonna clean before you got back but I didn't expect you so soon\". I just gave a hushed \"please leave\". He and his daughter left. But after giving it some thought, I told him he had to reimburse us the $1000 worth of food that he and his daughter ate. I told him their intake was absolutely repulsive. That I said he could have some, not eat everything in the house and leave us with nothing. He said that he had allowed his kid to have her friends over and they are a lot but he shouldn't have to give me $1000, given that I told him they could eat the food. That I have more than enough money (true) and he doesn't (also true). I still want to be reimbursed however. And yes, we split up. AITA?\n\nETA: this may make me sound bad but I wouldn't consider him house sitting as doing me any favors. All he has to do was dump out the dehumidifier when it got full. I could have asked my neighbor to do that for $200. He and his daughter live in a small apartment and coming to my house feels like a vacation to them (their words, not mine). I have a 2 story home with 6 bedrooms on the beach, with a hot tub, a game room, cable and high speed internet. They were essentially getting a free vacation and the only thing they had to do was dump the dehumidifier once a day. I more or less asked for the $1000 based off principle alone. I don't expect him to give me the money. But since he was not understanding my viewpoint on my it was acceptable, I asked him for the $1000 so he could open his eyes and understand how big of a deal it truly is. I did the big shop before leaving because I had work obligations scheduled for when I returned and going out and doing a big shop in the middle of 4 showings and mandatory seminars would have been a nightmare. I didn't buy any fridge stuff outside of what I knew they would eat. Everything I bought was nonperishables, box dinners and meat for the freezer. I didn't leave him over the food. I left him because after I tried explaining why this was wrong of him, he accused me of throwing my privilege/money in his face- knowing he's not as financially stable as me and making him and his daughter feel bad for \"doing nothing wrong\". I have never thrown money in his face, never asked him for anything and have paid for everything in the past 2 years because he could not. Helped him with multiple bills/things his daughter needed without question. So, he made me feel stupid and I won't tolerate it.", "created_utc": 1701894431, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cdbkk/aita_for_sending_him_a_bill_for_1000_after_him/", "score": 2827, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You just got a good glimpse of what your future looks like if you live with man and his daughter. He is responsible for the grocery bill. Send him the bill.

Where I live pet/house sitting would run about $50/day and my sitter provides their own food.  So it would cost me $550 for 11 days.  To feed a family of 4 in an expensive market costs me $2000 a month.  So even if they'd have consumed half the food that would be excessive IMO\n\n1.  There is no planet where it would be a reasonable expectation that it was a free-for-all on the food worth $1000.\n\n2. Even with friends over, how did they manage to eat that much food between 2 people in 11 days.\n\n3. If I saw my house in a complete pigsty when coming home early with a house sitter I'd probably have a stroke. They're supposed to care for the house in your absence, not frantically clean like a guilty teen 5 min before you get home.\n\nAnd the fact that this is not just some stranger you would expect the bare minimum from, but rather your long time partner, who you'd think would have more care about your belongings and your feelings, makes it even worse.", "NTA. What does this mooch even bring to the table?", "NTA.\n\nThey were there to take care of your home, not to have a vacation.  And why did Jack think it would be OK for his daughter to invite friends over to basically party at you house?\n\nThere was absolutely no excuse for the two of them not cleaning up after themselves. It doesn't matter when you were expected home.  They should have taken better care of your home.\n\nI don't care if you have money to replace the food, or if you told Jack that he and his daughter could have some of your food.  They took advantage of you.\n\nMaybe you won't get the $1000.  But I think that Jack should have at least paid to have someone come in and clean up his mess if he didn't.  Also, if you have 6 bedrooms, why doesn't Jack's daughter have space of her own?  That she messed up your daughter's room so badly is really despicable.\n\nIn your place, I would seriously be considering the future of this relationship.", "His input is mildly understandable I guess until he brought up the fact his daughters friends were round. I feel like it\u2019s common knowledge and courtesy to not invite people over to a house you\u2019ll occupy that you know isn\u2019t yours unless you\u2019ve cleared it with the home owner/primary resident. \n\nI feel like the money issue specifically is definitely reasonable and more than understandable. I think he should owe you that money. The implication \u201csome\u201d obviously doesn\u2019t mean all and he should assume that he can have 2 weeks worth of food for him and his daughter. Maybe he misheard you, but I can\u2019t imagine he did. \n\nNTA.", "NTA what were they thinking?!?\n\nThey were guests in your home and disrespected your things, your furniture and your pantry.

Living day to day with this behavior will be a nightmare for you and your kids.", "NTA.\n\nWhat they did wasn't housesitting. Did you check to see if the dehumidifier was even dumped?", "NTA - you stocked up on enough food for 4 weeks, for five people plus a weekend visit by his daughter and they got through it all in less than two weeks - by feeding it to guests to your house that you did not know about an did not invite while simultaneously trashing your home.  He should have gone through no more than 20% max of the food. \n\n  \nwell, he\u2019s shown you his level of respect for you and it\u2019s not high is it?   \nnext time get the little dingus that let's a dehumidifier drain into a sink instead of a tank and you won\u2019t need them emptying By anyone then bf and daughter can stay in their own tiny home in a bad neighbour hood and eat  all their own food and trash their own place.", "NTA but the bigger issue you have is the lack of respect from your boyfriend! Yea he was doing you a favor, but between all the food they ate and allowing his kid to have friends over without permission shows his lack of respect for you or your home. He allowed them to eat an entire month of food in less than 2 weeks. He should be reimbursing you for the majority of it!!", "NTA and why would he allow other kids to come to your home and raid your refrigerator and mess up your home", "NTA. You just got a glimpse of what your life would\u2019ve been if he would have moved in. He is an irresponsible man- I mean teenager, he let his daughter have friends over, yours and your daughter\u2019s clothes were all over the place, it sounds like a movie where teenagers have wild parties when the parents go away and the house is completely destroyed\u2026.and they ate over $1,000 on food in less than 2 weeks?  It was awful what he did, but be grateful because you got rid of it.", "NTA, but I think you chalk this up to a learning experience.  You told him to eat your food and he did.  That he ate more than your ambiguous instruction is not really something to pursue, especially since he was housesitting as  favor.  He is an AH though for being trashy and letting a bunch of strangers in your house.  I just don't see how this is worth it to pursue.

Do you think you can actually recover money from you if he tells you to take a hike?", "I once asked a friend to house sit for me. She gave my key to her 19 year old brother and he stayed there instead of her. It took me two weeks to get the place back into a semblance of order. He ate (and drank) me out of house and home. He was still there when I got home and had thrown up in the bathtub (he cleaned that up, thank you very much). I never asked my friend to house sit again, didn't ask for money, and learned a valuable lesson about the fact that you pay for your help one way or another. NTA but you're not getting that money.", "Best thing that could have happened to you. For all  the aggravation, you just saw your future with this guy, and its not pretty, The fact he even said privilege/money seems like he resents your accomplishments, career ect... Stay away.

And leaving your house a big mess and was going to \u201cclean\u201d it before you got back\u2026. No you don\u2019t make a big mess when you are house sitting.  If anything there shouldn\u2019t be any messes either.  I understand eating a little of your food but not all of it or majority of it and feeding everyone else.", " NTA but consider this a lesson learned and a bullet dodged. Let it go and block him everywhere. \n\nI am sorry he is so disgusting and treated your house like a flop house.", "I think it would be worth the $1000 to know that your relationship values aren't the same.", "The heck? NTA. Jack sounds like a mooch looking for an opportunity to be a gold-digger. I can see why you live separately. You have the right idea there. I'd say dump him, but I know a non-negligible number of wealthy older women who \"keep\" scrungy, broke-ass older men like Jack as \"mistresses,\" so that might be your thing. Good luck getting the $1k, you're gonna need it!", "NTA but he is. I cannot get over how dirty you described your house, and am not sure how you plan to continue a relationship with someone who allowed his child to throw a party, eat 90% of your food and trash your home. How will you ever trust him and his daughter again? What if you had an emergency, and were gone for longer?", "NTA", "NTA  Time to end this!", "Definitely NTA. I don\u2019t care if you spend $100,000 on food. It was your food. You certainly don\u2019t pig out and eat everything in sight and you sure as hell don\u2019t invite others to eat and sleep there as well. It\u2019s not an all you can eat buffet/resort. The kid may have not known any better but he should have. Take pics of your grocery receipts and send them to him every week.", "NTA. But that is the best $1,000 you ever spent. If you understood the message. He is not a keeper and if you think that the two of you should move forward you now see your future. Cut things off and count it a blessing.", "NTA. You didn't explicitly state he and his daughter could eat all your food. You especially did NOT say that his daughter could have friends over to eat your food.\n\n They treated your house as an all inclusive for two weeks it sounds like.", "NTA. Forget the food, his daughter having friends over without permission from you and the house being in a mess is an absolute red flag to me. And throwing your financial status back in your face when you said you were unhappy with how everything was, he obviously feels a huge imbalance between the two of you and feels justified in doing what he likes because of it. \n\nI think asking for the whole $1000 back is a bit much but considering they left food scraps and fed the daughter's friends (when it was just meant for the two of them), I understand asking for some money back.", "NTA, maybe you should give him a bill for the $1000, like $750 for food and $250 for the cleaning bill", "NTA for wanting him to but there\u2019s like a 90% chance it\u2019s not happening.", "He's an AH! Who housesits for someone especially a significant other and does this! He ate all your food and trashed your house with no thought to you or your kids. He knew what he was doing. No one eats that much food. If he doesn't pay, take him to small claims. Document everything and have pictures of how it looks. Anyone who says that you told him to eat and he did to word things better is wrong. A proper house guest doesn't do this. NTA. Dump him and make sure you do get reimbursed", "NTA but I wouldn't count on him paying up for the food. \n\nThe way he totally disrespected your home and space says a lot about the type of person he truly is. Consider the $1000 in food costs well worth it to truly find out Jack and his daughter are not people you want to do life with and he's someone who is not worthy of you.", "Who thinks it is okay to invite friends over when you're staying at someone else's home?  NTA.", "INFO Why was he surprised when you came home?\n\nWas it not communicated when to expect you back?\n\nI think it's kinda wild it's a 2 day drive and he had no idea you were coming back right then.", "ESH- You should have made the rules clear if there were any. He shouldn't have abused your kindness.\n\nAlso, I don't believe you when you added on \"I don't expect him to give me the money\". You broke up with him. If you didn't mean it, you wouldn't have rubbed salt in the breakup wound with the request, especially since you know he likely literally does not have the money.", "ESH. He was probably excessive with the food and shouldn\u2019t have allowed his daughter to have friends over if that wasn\u2019t ok with you. However, wanted someone to house sit for you, said they could eat some of the food, and came back earlier than you said. If your idea of a house \u201cin ruin\u201d is dirty dishes and dirty clothes, then I\u2019d suggest professional help for that. Your reaction seems pretty disproportionate. \n\nYou are clearly very materialistic, and should probably date someone who is more aligned.

Leaving your house in a disaster state? Then not appreciating you pay for everything over 2 years? The audacity\u2026 the audacity.", "NTA, but at least you know what to expect now if you did move in together, I suspect the way you raise your kids is totally different to the way he does & that may be incompatible in the long term.
