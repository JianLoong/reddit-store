One of my coworkers (M27) who I\u2019m very close with got extremely angry with me when I got the job and started to become passive aggressive with me. I talked to him about it and he told me I was selfish for leaving all my work behind for him and the rest of our coworkers to do. He also said that our boss hired me for a reason and that I was leaving her to do everything alone now. He also called me dumb and delusional for leaving because I got inspired by a guy. I told him that I always knew I needed experience because of my minor and because of the kinds of jobs I want after I graduate. I\u2019m still leaving in 5 days, but my question is am I selfish for leaving and an asshole for leaving them with my leftover work?", "created_utc": 1693492170, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166cpgu/aita_for_moving_to_california/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
