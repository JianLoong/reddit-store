Your late FIL willed it to your husband, it's up to your husband to decides what happens to it, and he wants you to wear it. BILs opinion is not relevant.", "NTA, it sounds like the brother just wants the watch for the money and you being able to wear it might come off as showy to him if he is having money problems. I'd ask you husband first about that and then maybe the brother to see if that is the core issue. Keep wearing the watch though.", "NTA it doesn't matter what your BIL wants because it's not good watch.

Seriously your husband gave it to you. His brother can pack sand. NTAH", "NTA...Your husband made a sweet gesture and you're obviously touched and grateful.  Don't let his brother's greed poison the gesture.", "NTA. Your husband inherited the watch and so it is now his property. He gifted it to you and said HE, the owner, would be honoured of you wore it. You are perfectly within your rights to rock that baby.\n\nThe brother needs to get over it. He had the chance to own the watch and he passed on it.", "NTA, it was given to your husband and not the BIL, so his opinion doesn't matter.

He gifted it to you. It is now yours.\n\nWear it with pride! \n\nBut never ever take it off in your BILs presence (or his wife's). If you go swimming, don't wear the watch to the event and take it. If you are having a big cookout, don't take it off to cook messy food. Just don't wear it to the event. Don't give them an opportunity.", "Honey, NTA - What a beautiful gift your husband gave you - and you are honoring the gift, your husband and his late father. Who cares what the BIL says. I would be very careful, though, that if your BIL is ever in the house, you know exactly where that watch is. Make sure it doesn't have a loose clasp, you don't want it \"walking away\" into your BIL or SIL hands. You need to give this wonderful hubby of yours an extra kiss and hug for his sweet, thoughtful gift and for standing up for you on this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Like museums lend out at.", "NTA, I have a watch that was my grandfather's (coincidentally, also a beautiful classic cartier). The watch was left to my uncle, my grandfather's son, who pawned it to pay for legal fees. He had no intention of picking that watch back up and it would've been lost to my family forever. My mom bought the watch from the pawn shop and gave it to me. If he mentioned selling the watch, keep that thing safe. Also, the watch was left to your husband, who is honored to have you wear it, and it seems that you feel honored by owning it and wearing it proudly. Don't let some jealous, greedy BIL take that away from the two of you, and if it causes too many problems, just don't wear it around that guy. May I suggest a $5 Hello Kitty watch to wear in front of him? You can say you traded in the Cartier", "NTA. Your husband gave it to you knowing you\u2019d wear it. The fact that BIL mentioned selling it is the reason nobody wanted him to have it.", "NTA. The watch belonged to your husband who gave it to you. BIL didn't want it until now and probably realized how much it's worth or that he could have given it to his wife instead. If you are petty then wear it all the time in front of him. If you prefer to avoid the drama just avoid wearing it when you know he's around. Either way keep that locked up where he can never find it if he visits your house or if you ever have to take it off in his presence.", "NTA. Your BIL (or his new wife) is smelling money and he\u2019s using emotional manipulation tactics to get it.\n\nYour MIL gave your husband this watch after his father died, with the consent of your BIL, because he wasn\u2019t interested in a \u201cfeminine\u201d watch. Therefore it is your husband\u2019s watch and he wants you to wear it. Ignore BIL, keep the watch and wear it proudly.", "Unless the watch was not specified in his will. It could be a contestable inheritance.
