It's fine if he hasn't found his passion in life yet for his career but he should know to have another job lined up before quitting the current one.", "NTA\n\nHis poor financial decisions and inability to manage his money is not your problem. \n\nYou have a child now, which is you number one priority. Not giving money to someone who cannot make more of an effort to provide for his family.", "NTA. There are resources for those with children who need help. Plus he is an adult and shouldn't have knocked someone up if he couldn't keep a job and provide for that child.", "NTA.", "NTA you and your husband cannot be responsible for two families. If you can afford to help and you\u2019re worried about their child, share some baby basics (formula, clothes, wipes etc) but you\u2019re under no obligation to do so! You have to look after your own family\u2019s finances.", "NTA at all, however, if you are wanting to help out but not actually give him money, what about offering to buy baby supplies like nappys. That way you know the money is going on the baby.\nBut again NTA even if you did nothing.", "NTA \nThe BIL needs an intervention. The family needs to come together and make it clear that they will no longer financially support him directly. \n\nHe does need another kind of support - a financial therapist. These people are equipped to help clients improve their emotional relationship with money.\n\nAs a family, you will pay for his therapy and buy his child nappies and other items for a period of 6 months or so.\n\nAnd if things still don't work out, then he's an adult and the best favor you can do for him is to figure out how to adult on his own.", "NTA so whats happened to the 650$ he owes for the tyres?  Its your fault for getting sucked in.\n\nIf he wanted to use the paypal - you say ok - hand me over 800 in cash first, we have no money in our account to cover that transaction. Or you tell him to set up a paypal - all he he needs is to link it to any bank account or credit card. It takes a couple of mins.  Instead you allowed yourself to be used.\n\nIf  you keep bailing  him, he knows you are there and he will quit or lose this job in the next 2 months. His GF can ask other people, her family, she can apply for child benefits and support too in the meantime.", "\u201cI wish I could say yes but I won\u2019t be able to help anymore\u201d  \nalthough, if you\u2019re worried the baby, maybe you could offer some nappies ? Or milk substitute if the gf is not breastfeeding?\n\nbut no money anymore. Your BIL, is So used to being caught when he fails that he isn\u2019t taking precautions to prevent it anymore, even with a kid. This is very unhealthy. And it won\u2019t be easy to make him realise that he is creating the situation.\n\nAll he will see is that he needs help and you are turning your back. It won\u2019t be fun but it is what is needed in the long run.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your BIL is 25, so he's old enough to take care himself and bear the consequences of bringing a child into the world. People like your BIL need to learn how to stand on their own two feet and hold down a job because helping them *too much* just enables their poor behaviour.\n\nYou have your own child to prioritise. Don't give your BIL any more money.", "NTA. He money problems are not your problems. Never give him anything again, but don't be surprised if he just increases his leeching off of your other relatives.", "Nope. NTA. He needs to start adulting. You and your husband can\u2019t raise your child AND him.", "NTA - continuing to assist him with money in any form (access to your PayPal/using it to finance his purchase(s), loans, gifts, IOUs...ANYTHING) is enabling and actually playing a massive role in his continued behaviors regarding not taking employment seriously, and relying on others to pick up his own slack regarding personal financial matters and responsibilities. you've put your foot down, now, stand firm. get your husband on board with this. if anyone in your family cocks an eyebrow at this, you don't have to explain yourselves. if you feel the desire to, however, just plainly state that you have a new addition to your family, and that you are personally not yet able to return to work for good reason, and that your finances are dedicated to and staying within your home and immediate family.", "Nta I'd be buying him appointments to a financial adviser so he learn how to handle money", "NTA - what does your spouse say? \n\nYou could easily say no bc he never paid back the last bill.\n\nOR I would probably draw a line in the sand - especially with the new baby - that this is the last time you\u2019re loaning him money. And that you expect to get paid back.\n\nAnd then stick to it. No more loaning him money. Your family etc can and will do whatever they want - but not your problem \n\n(Also I\u2019m a softie and usually go one step too far lol so maybe the first option is best)\n\nBut don\u2019t get preachy. It\u2019s about you and where you are and you can\u2019t help him", "NTA.

I knew a guy with the same work pattern who would get a good upswing from getting a new job and being productive, but after a few months, the downswing would take over and he'd become an immobile mass of depression, not work, lose his job, and have to find another one.  Great guy some of the time, but a struggle for the rest.  There's no benefit in enabling such destructive behavior, but perhaps his behavior might change with the right meds.", "Nta. And he just had a child too?? Awful person", "NTA don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm. Your responsibility is to your own family. \n\nHe needs to sort out whatever shit he has going on and be responsible for his. \n\nThe way he's living isn't sustainable and it sounds like theres no end in sight, how long does he expect you to pick up the slack?", "NTA you do not have a BIL problem, you have a lack of a spine problem. You all created the monster. Now it is time to stamp on it.", "nta. stop giving him money ! Have the talk with your husband and be a united front. You have a child that comes first. He needs to grow up.", "NTA he can fend for himself.", "NTA - at what point is this person going to be responsible for himself?

You might as well have them all move with you.", "NTA", "My friend works for a recruitment agency, and she warns people that job hopping too much can be a massive disadvantage. If it looks like someone can't hold down a position, it's suspicious. Many employers don't waste their time hiring someone who is likely to leave before 3 months is even up. People like OP's BIL need to be mindful of this. Our mate learned it the hard way when he had more than 12 jobs in the space of two years, and he had to write a really convincing cover letter just to get an interview. He got the job and stuck it out for 2 years, knowing he needed longtime work on his CV (resume).", "Yes and his family is enabling him to remain an impulsive, irresponsible child. They have been doing this guy no favours by not letting him find his own legs.", "We already gave them a lot of the good clothes my daughter already grew out of... plus a breast pump and various other presents. It's also not like I always was totally against helping him, but we were always very frugal (though we also have loans for our car and my studies) and now we have to be so even more and it just makes me so mad that he is a bottomless pit...", "That's a good idea", "Might really talk with my mil, my husband and his granny about that... he is just really evasive about problems of any kind so who knows how he will react to that:/", "You are def right about that, we both were always to trusting and nice. Just super hard to say no to family.    Also it wasn't even for something useful like tires.. it's a wheel base for a driving Simulator you play games like raceroom on your PC with... Telling this def makes me seem even more like an idiot...", "My husband also is pretty annoyed by it, but he also has a soft spot for him (obviously he is his little brother). Their parents got divorced when they were 14 and 10, so BIL took it quite harder and my husband kinda got into that Support Situation. I also know them all half my life know, my husband and I have been dating since high school... So basically he also thinks it's too much at this point but still a bit too nice to say know.. it will be hard I fear", "Wouldn't go that far, I guess he never got any financial education (which neither my husband nor I got, we are self taught, so that is in no way an excuse). I think he also got a problem with deferred gratification and probably not much discipline... doubt there are meds for that. Besides that he is a really fun and nice guy. But that financial stuff really harms the relationship with his family", "His resume definitely doesn't look good... idk if he knows this or even cares about it. Hope he can stick with the job he currently has, because I also fear he is running out if options", "It is really annoying when people take advantage of your kindness. You\u2019re perfectly right to say no, and not feel guilty about it! It has to stop at some point\u2026", "Wow I thought wheel for a car.\n\nOh my - he can sell his whole PC and games system, all his games , he can sell this wheel base whatever it is. He will have months of money for his baby + he can pay you back the 650$.\n\nIf he says baby needs x,y,z - say sure sell the wheel base, sell your games, sell your pc on ebay. Good luck.\n\nI thought this was tyres and his car and he needs the car for the baby so couldnt sell the tyres he bought\n\nDo not pay for his meals at restaurants, do not get sucked into using your credit card, paypal or anything.  Dont get sucked in by my baby has no forumla, no nappies, needs x, y, z. Yes the baby needs this things, but your BIL doesnt need a driving simulator to play games on. He doesnt need to play games to survive, that wont keep his baby well fed and clothes. Those are wants, and if he cant keep a job he  doesnt get to have those wants.", "Lol that's pretty dumb. Please stop giving him handouts. Nta", "Then say yes this time so it\u2019s not out of the blue, but make it clear you can\u2019t do it anymore bc things are tight and being planned with you guys. Make it about you, not him", "If you'd care to, you could pass this info on to your husband, so he can warn his brother to start taking work more seriously. Once he's deemed unemployable, it'll be hard to encourage a business to take a chance on him. Your husband could also reiterate that you'll no longer give BIL any more money, so he needs to stick to a job and support his child. Shit has to start getting serious now BIL is a parent."]}
