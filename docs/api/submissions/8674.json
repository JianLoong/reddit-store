Why should he - he has multiple suckers that are willing to give them their money.", "you shouldn't have ever paid for anything in the first place.

It's always oh but he had a difficult life growing up, oh but it's not his fault that he is struggling. I'm sorry but there comes a stage when we all reach adulthood and our decisions and actions from there on out are the consequences of our own behavior.  He is going to be 45 years old and still playing oh but my parents got divorced when I was 10 card.", "Nta", "NTA. Your priorities have changed, for good reason. It also sounds like your BIL has ADHD and it would really turn things around for him if he got tested and treated", "Nta, but he is going to keep doing this as long as you and your family let him. You all need to agree to stop giving him money. That is the only way his behavior will change.", "NTA\nI have an ex BIL with this same issue. He lived with me for 6 years AFTER his sister and I divorced (we are still friends, we just realized we did not work out as a couple) and I finally had to set me foot down. He ended up moving out in secret taking a few things of mine. He lived with a girl from work (a job he got fired from after 2 months) and she kicked him out after 2 weeks. He bounced around for a few months staying a few weeks here and there. Finally his grandfather gave him ONE shot. Paid for his apartment and school to become a lab tech. He now is a lab manager. It took everything being lost and his grandfather giving him the ultimatum that this was the last shot and after that he was out of the family. \n\nSometimes it takes being this harsh... and if they do not do what they need to do... then its on THEM, not you.", "NTA but your husband has to own this. \n\nIt\u2019s not that he can\u2019t help; it\u2019s that he can\u2019t help *financially*.

It is fair, and kind, to let him know before his next financial \"emergency.\"", "NTA, OP. But your husband is going to have to sit down and have a very much adult conversation with his 'little brother' where he makes it clear that not only do the two of you have a household to maintain, a child to raise, and expenses of your own---but now, so does he. It should be explained to him that the handouts for his living expenses, needs, and wants have stopped completely also reminding him about the many, many times that he has received help from the two of you without paying you back. I would suggest that he be given or shown some websites to help him create and learn how to budget with a very stern warning that if he were to decide to quit his job that no financial help would be forthcoming. Your husband needs to also have this conversation with his mother and grandmother, so that they know that the two of you have decided that you can't be your BIL's back up plan any longer. You won't be able to stop either of them from enabling him, but the two of you really have to. What are you going to tell your daughter, \"No food and lights this month because Uncle Loser needed another wheel base for his game system?\" or \"No university for you because we had to help support Uncle Loser's kids?\" \n\nThe two of you have to get real clear on the fact that BIL's life choices have no bearing on what the two of you are responsible for.", "That is one way to do it, but some employers ask what someone did in between jobs if there\u2019s lengthy or frequent gaps.
