She has special needs so it was really nice for her to find a workplace that was very accommodating and flexible. She did this to try and save money up. At first I was proud of her and happy. I thought her uniform was a little short but I didn't say anything. I let her work a few weeks before I went by. Then, I thought I'd pop in as a customer. \n\nWhen I got there I went and sat down. While I was there I saw lots of flirting from middle aged men to her. I heard a man go as far as to ask something that could be very sexual and was slightly weird for the context (very clearly intentional) but she didn't seem to get it (she never gets that kind of thing). When she left to go get the \"box\" of condiments, I straight up said so he could hear \"she's 16.\" I was met with the reply \"I didn't touch her.\"\n\nI was very uneased by this.  I ended up going the next day too and it was more of the same type of thing. \n\nI talked to my daughter and she didn't understand what was wrong or notice anything was off. I know some social things go over hear head especially things like this. I decided to the workplace isn't safe enough for her to work there. I made her quit. She's so mad at me.

Given her age and my inability to fully know her disability I'm going with NAH.", "NAH. Have you sat her down and had a good long talk with her about why you are upset? I totally support you protecting your daughter from these pigs masquerading as humans. But you need to have a long talk with her. Explain what you saw. Explain what it means. You know her comprehension level better than I do. You know how to get your point across, be it with examples, or something.", "NAH except for the creepy customers. Listen. My guy. My man. What you need to understand is that this is a really, *really* common phenomenon in the restaurant industry. Creepy dudes perv on waitresses and then whine about how the customer is always right if the waitress stands up for herself. Everybody has to figure out there own way of coping with that.", "I totally understand where you are coming from but the world is full of creeps and you can\u2019t protect her from them all at all times. The best thing you can do is equip her to deal with the real world. NAH", "Dancing between NAH and YTA and NTA. I'm very torn, coming from the prospective of a once teen girl whose dad would glare at leering men and telling them how young I actually was (well, rarely, he'd mostly just gripe quietly or to my mom and keep a closer eye on me). I had almost never noticed the men. (I like to think I'd have noticed if they were saying creepy things though, and I \\*do\\* remember some making me feel uneasy.\n\nSo I remember this feeling of stuff going on around me that I wasn't quite aware of and thinking he was just being in extra intense Dad mode. Because you're seeing it through the eyes of a grown man AND her dad. Your desire to protect is understandable. But, and this is where I lean on YTA is, that your daughter i*s going to have to deal with this forever* and it's going to stop just because you made her quit this job. She won't be in a bubble forever. I like to hope that someday men will learn how to not be creepy or abusive and so on, but I'm about to turn 40 and creepers are still gonna creep, so I'm not holding my breathe.\n\nSo you talked to her and she doesn't quite \"get\" the problem. Not a huge shock. In her mind, she's there to make money being a waitress and that's what she's doing. I think the better first step would have been to talk to the management about the issue and see what steps they could take to deal with the situation. And always tell your daughter what you are doing and why. Teach her how to be safe. Though maybe your sons and / or a trusted woman/women would be best to tell her what to look out for.", "YTA. \n\nI understand where you are coming from, but by making her quit, you are making this her problem, her fault. She shouldn't have to quit over other people's behavior. \n\n1) It would have been better to talk to the management, or give her tips for dealing with that kind of behavior. \n\n2) you need to explain to her what behavior is problematic and why, and make it clear that it's not her fault.", "YTA but hear me out. Only you know your daughter but here\u2019s my take, having been a young hot waitress when I was her age. It is gross. But she\u2019ll have to be hot and get looked at and bothered by middle aged men for years to come. This is a very controlled version of it and assuming the restaurant management is responsible, she is safe. A good waitress in the right place can make a LOT of money. More money than any other high school job. Also, nothing I have ever done, no school I have ever attended, no intellectual enrichment I have ever sought out has ever sharpened me mentally in quite the same way that really busy waitressing did. And being neurodivergent and having struggled with social anxiety, waitressing taught me to interact with all kinds of people in a controlled and safe environment where I was in control and I would be lost without the skills I honed doing it. It has contributed to every success I have had since. So like old dudes looking at me was just like something that would have happened anyway but at least I learned how to deal with it in an environment where if it got too uncomfortable they would just be asked to leave. But monitor her. Talk to her about it. Don\u2019t just react to this one situation. It may not be right for her since you said she has special needs and idk what those are. It\u2019s certainly not for everyone.", "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, you want to protect your daughter, but this is the reality of any woman in customer service. I worked at Subway as a teen and would be sexualized by men every day for just doing my job. It\u2019s going to be hard for her to find something at her age where this doesn\u2019t happen. The best thing to do as her father is teach her how to be safe. Help her understand when it\u2019s best to ignore them or report them to someone higher up. It\u2019s terrible that men get away with this, but it\u2019s unfortunately a part of customer service and it\u2019ll be the same story if she works somewhere else.", "YTA\n\nMaking her quit is blaming her for the creepy customers. That's just life. Creepy men are gonna be creepy towards women no matter where they work. She could be a nun in a habit and men would still creep on her. Are you gonna be in your 70's checking up on her at work when she's in her 40's?", "Face the facts; that is, every female over the age of 12 is going to be sexually harassed.  At least she WAS in a relatively safe place because it was all just verbal with other customers and staff about.  You could have used it as a teaching moment, but you blew it and made her quit.  Now she will wonder if she was at fault, AND she did not learn to recognize and handle sexual harassment.\n\nYTA.  Think, then act.", "You are infantilising her. Stop being over protective and let her grow up.", "Let me guess, in your world words have magic powers.", "YTA she's gonna be sexually harrased her whole life no matter where she goes (man that's depressing to say) since you said that the comments seem to go over her head. Make sure she knows that if they begin touching then that's when she needs to say something.", "YTA. You should not have gone to her restaurant. \n\nThe whole point of having a teen is to help them get independent. Having you on her back defeats that.", "Yta. You're stealing away her independence and basically punishing her for a bad creepy man's actions. \n\nNow he has literally won. He has ultimate power over her, which is what creepy men like to do to women above all else. They go into our spaces, get invasive, and try to dominate. Or push to get attention.\n\nAnd even when they don't, they get off on having disrupted our peace.\n\nI get that you're concerned about predators, but they are literally EVERYWHERE. You will never be able to shield her 100 percent. You could have reported him to a manager. That's the correct thing to do. Not further violated her autonomy and take away her job that she's proud of. \n\nApologize to her and tell her she can resume work.", "Did you even consider going to the manager and discussing things? Let him/her know what was going on and seeing if there was a way to let her keep her job? She was making her own money. Something that made her feel good about herself and all she sees is you took that away.\nI understand completely you protecting her, that mother thing never goes away.", "NAH probably (except the skeevy customers). \n\nI second the other commenter asking if she was actually unsafe vs you just being uncomfortable; some jobs are about making the skeevy guys pay out the nose.\n\nSome of those places have management that protects the employees; some protect the customers. It's possible that this was a rare place where your daughter could safely make money hand over fist without noticing the grossness, but it's much more likely that her ignorance is a vulnerability. \n\nIt sounds like your daughter needs to hear more about what kinds of things can happen, how to recognize unsafe people, and how to protect herself from them. Gavin de Becker wrote a book called The Gift of Fear that, frankly, I think everyone should read in their mid to late teens. He also wrote Protecting the Gift, which is aimed at parents. If you haven't, I recommend reading them both and then giving the first one to your daughter to read and talk about.", "YTA.  She is going to have to deal with cat-calling, sexual harassment, and probably at least light stalking, if not much worse at some point.  Especially if she is a pedestrian in a city for any length of time.  It's better that she learn how to recognize it and deal with it.\n\nBy 16, I had already had a stalker, been followed as a pedestrian, and been followed when driving.  It's unfortunately part of growing up.", "NAH\n\nYou're trying to protect your kid, which is admirable, but the reality is she'll be getting those comments no matter what job she's at. I'm unclear what exactly her disability is, but if she can hold a job as a waitress then she can probably understand a conversation about what to watch out for from creepy customers and the importance of reporting such behaviors to her supervisor. \n\nI hate how strange men treat young women, especially minors, but there's really no job a minor is qualified for that doesn't involve interacting with potentially gross strangers. Teaching her to recognize when people are potentially being gross and how to advocate for herself would probably be the better move here, but like I said I don't understand her disability.", "YTA\n\nWhat are you going to do? Ban her from every situation with dodgy men? That\u2019s pretty much everything. \n\nIt would have been a lot better to teach her how to recognise this, what to do, who to ask for help etc. equip her with everything she needs to cope with harassment because god she\u2019s going to need it for years to come. \n\nInstead you\u2019ve effectively punished her for other peoples actions.", "NTA she may be bad now, but in the future hopefully she can agree with you. Personally I relate to this. I had my first job at 16 and I worked in a college area, so every customer at work assumed I was older. One time a customer got creepy, my managers stepped in and my mom came to get me(extremely grateful someone was there for me) I really wonder why management didn\u2019t get involved if this happened multiple times. Maybe you could\u2019ve talked to them first though. Either way minors should be protected everywhere. Maybe together you guys can find another job", "I kind of get the feeling from this post that it\u2019s being inflated to fit the overly protective dad theory, perfect opportunity to talk to your daughter about all the \u201cbads\u201d out in the world, but NOOO you went straight for the jugular, dude she is in a public place I get there are weirdo\u2019s out there but she will meet them in other places, would it have been BAD!! to have a discussion?", "YTA. You should have talked to the management if you were concerned, but she was happy and from her perspective didn't have any problems working there. \n\nDo you think it's actually unsafe, or did it just make you uncomfortable that they were looking at your child?", "I would say NTA, but at the same time I understand her frustration. She\u2019s not going to understand until she\u2019s able to see it for herself. (Speaking from experience)", "NTA. You\u2019re a great dad, don\u2019t let anyone tell you otherwise. But make sure to sit her down and teach her what is and isn\u2019t acceptable. You could\u2019ve talked to the manager first, but I get your rage. Who would want their 16 year old working anyway? School is stressful enough. You could read her some of our comments as well, or let her read through them herself, to understand the severity of what those disgusting men were doing. I\u2019ve gotten sexually harassed several times at work. An old man even \u201caccidentally\u201d brushed his hand on my butt. Bunch of sick fucks", "NTA. Obviously, you need to take extra precautions because your daughter does not understand the danger she is in. Did you talk to her employer? If they are accommodating enough for her needs, you'd think they would not appreciate her being mistreated.", "NTA", "NAH. You have a duty to protect your daughter, even from the things she doesn't see as a threat. Use this as a teaching opportunity.", "NAH, bordering barely Y T A\n\nWhen your daughter works *any* job, there will be creeps. Either it'll be coworkers or it'll be customers. It's just the day-to-day of any public facing job.\n\nYou could have, and likely should have, taken this opportunity, if it counts as one, to teach her how to spot and deal with that behavior.\n\nYou were 100% correct to be concerned, I think you were maybe wrong to demand she quit. Your daughter and your sons/friends see you punishing *her* for something out of her control, and as bad as it is, totally regular in the public sphere. Now, she doesn't have a job, can't save money like she wanted, AND knows you'll just unilaterally decide she's quitting no matter the consequences to her future employment.

She has to learn about the world without coddling or protecting 24/7, so maybe next time try explaining your point of view and give her advice rather than making her quit authoritatively.", "I totally understand where you\u2019re coming from as a parent, but also this happens to girls constantly. It doesn\u2019t make it OK by any stretch of the imagination but creepy men are everywhere. A better path than just making her quit is to really help her see what\u2019s happening and also make sure she has a really strong sense of self. Doesn\u2019t feel the need to people please and just go along with things and that she can stand up for herself anytime or go to the Manager etc.  Then if her workplace now or in the future are not supportive that it\u2019s OK to completely get out of the situation.

Just seems like sexual harassment.", "You're protecting her.\n\nCan you help her to get a job at a paint store or Home Depot where she would be so much saferi?\n\nA waitress job can be potentially risky for any female depending on the type of restaurant and location, let alone a female with special needs.", "Oof. NTA, but I do see why she's upset. The sad reality is that female waitstaff are targets for that kind of behavior. Maybe see if the restaurant (or a different one) has a hostess position instead of actual serving until she's a little older. It would still put her in contact with customers, but it's brief and less personal. And sit down with her and have a good talk about sexuality and the abuse servers often get from customers, and the real physical danger she could end up in.", "NTA protecting your children always comes first", "What kind of restaurant is filled with creepy men hitting on 16 year olds?
