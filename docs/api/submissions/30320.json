She has special needs so it was really nice for her to find a workplace that was very accommodating and flexible. She did this to try and save money up. At first I was proud of her and happy. I thought her uniform was a little short but I didn't say anything. I let her work a few weeks before I went by. Then, I thought I'd pop in as a customer. \n\nWhen I got there I went and sat down. While I was there I saw lots of flirting from middle aged men to her. I heard a man go as far as to ask something that could be very sexual and was slightly weird for the context (very clearly intentional) but she didn't seem to get it (she never gets that kind of thing). When she left to go get the \"box\" of condiments, I straight up said so he could hear \"she's 16.\" I was met with the reply \"I didn't touch her.\"\n\nI was very uneased by this.  I ended up going the next day too and it was more of the same type of thing. \n\nI talked to my daughter and she didn't understand what was wrong or notice anything was off. I know some social things go over hear head especially things like this. I decided to the workplace isn't safe enough for her to work there. I made her quit. She's so mad at me.

Given her age and my inability to fully know her disability I'm going with NAH.", "NAH. Have you sat her down and had a good long talk with her about why you are upset? I totally support you protecting your daughter from these pigs masquerading as humans. But you need to have a long talk with her. Explain what you saw. Explain what it means. You know her comprehension level better than I do. You know how to get your point across, be it with examples, or something.", "NAH except for the creepy customers. Listen. My guy. My man. What you need to understand is that this is a really, *really* common phenomenon in the restaurant industry. Creepy dudes perv on waitresses and then whine about how the customer is always right if the waitress stands up for herself. Everybody has to figure out there own way of coping with that.", "I totally understand where you are coming from but the world is full of creeps and you can\u2019t protect her from them all at all times. The best thing you can do is equip her to deal with the real world. NAH", "Dancing between NAH and YTA and NTA. I'm very torn, coming from the prospective of a once teen girl whose dad would glare at leering men and telling them how young I actually was (well, rarely, he'd mostly just gripe quietly or to my mom and keep a closer eye on me). I had almost never noticed the men. (I like to think I'd have noticed if they were saying creepy things though, and I \\*do\\* remember some making me feel uneasy.\n\nSo I remember this feeling of stuff going on around me that I wasn't quite aware of and thinking he was just being in extra intense Dad mode. Because you're seeing it through the eyes of a grown man AND her dad. Your desire to protect is understandable. But, and this is where I lean on YTA is, that your daughter i*s going to have to deal with this forever* and it's going to stop just because you made her quit this job. She won't be in a bubble forever. I like to hope that someday men will learn how to not be creepy or abusive and so on, but I'm about to turn 40 and creepers are still gonna creep, so I'm not holding my breathe.\n\nSo you talked to her and she doesn't quite \"get\" the problem. Not a huge shock. In her mind, she's there to make money being a waitress and that's what she's doing. I think the better first step would have been to talk to the management about the issue and see what steps they could take to deal with the situation. And always tell your daughter what you are doing and why. Teach her how to be safe. Though maybe your sons and / or a trusted woman/women would be best to tell her what to look out for.", "YTA. \n\nI understand where you are coming from, but by making her quit, you are making this her problem, her fault. She shouldn't have to quit over other people's behavior. \n\n1) It would have been better to talk to the management, or give her tips for dealing with that kind of behavior. \n\n2) you need to explain to her what behavior is problematic and why, and make it clear that it's not her fault.", "YTA but hear me out. Only you know your daughter but here\u2019s my take, having been a young hot waitress when I was her age. It is gross. But she\u2019ll have to be hot and get looked at and bothered by middle aged men for years to come. This is a very controlled version of it and assuming the restaurant management is responsible, she is safe. A good waitress in the right place can make a LOT of money. More money than any other high school job. Also, nothing I have ever done, no school I have ever attended, no intellectual enrichment I have ever sought out has ever sharpened me mentally in quite the same way that really busy waitressing did. And being neurodivergent and having struggled with social anxiety, waitressing taught me to interact with all kinds of people in a controlled and safe environment where I was in control and I would be lost without the skills I honed doing it. It has contributed to every success I have had since. So like old dudes looking at me was just like something that would have happened anyway but at least I learned how to deal with it in an environment where if it got too uncomfortable they would just be asked to leave. But monitor her. Talk to her about it. Don\u2019t just react to this one situation. It may not be right for her since you said she has special needs and idk what those are. It\u2019s certainly not for everyone.", "I understand where you\u2019re coming from, you want to protect your daughter, but this is the reality of any woman in customer service. I worked at Subway as a teen and would be sexualized by men every day for just doing my job. It\u2019s going to be hard for her to find something at her age where this doesn\u2019t happen. The best thing to do as her father is teach her how to be safe. Help her understand when it\u2019s best to ignore them or report them to someone higher up. It\u2019s terrible that men get away with this, but it\u2019s unfortunately a part of customer service and it\u2019ll be the same story if she works somewhere else.", "YTA\n\nMaking her quit is blaming her for the creepy customers. That's just life. Creepy men are gonna be creepy towards women no matter where they work. She could be a nun in a habit and men would still creep on her. Are you gonna be in your 70's checking up on her at work when she's in her 40's?", "Face the facts; that is, every female over the age of 12 is going to be sexually harassed.  At least she WAS in a relatively safe place because it was all just verbal with other customers and staff about.  You could have used it as a teaching moment, but you blew it and made her quit.  Now she will wonder if she was at fault, AND she did not learn to recognize and handle sexual harassment.\n\nYTA.  Think, then act.", "You are infantilising her. Stop being over protective and let her grow up.", "Let me guess, in your world words have magic powers.", "YTA she's gonna be sexually harrased her whole life no matter where she goes (man that's depressing to say) since you said that the comments seem to go over her head. Make sure she knows that if they begin touching then that's when she needs to say something.", "YTA. You should not have gone to her restaurant. \n\nThe whole point of having a teen is to help them get independent. Having you on her back defeats that.", "Yta. You're stealing away her independence and basically punishing her for a bad creepy man's actions. \n\nNow he has literally won. He has ultimate power over her, which is what creepy men like to do to women above all else. They go into our spaces, get invasive, and try to dominate. Or push to get attention.\n\nAnd even when they don't, they get off on having disrupted our peace.\n\nI get that you're concerned about predators, but they are literally EVERYWHERE. You will never be able to shield her 100 percent. You could have reported him to a manager. That's the correct thing to do. Not further violated her autonomy and take away her job that she's proud of. \n\nApologize to her and tell her she can resume work.", "Did you even consider going to the manager and discussing things? Let him/her know what was going on and seeing if there was a way to let her keep her job? She was making her own money. Something that made her feel good about herself and all she sees is you took that away.\nI understand completely you protecting her, that mother thing never goes away.", "NAH probably (except the skeevy customers). \n\nI second the other commenter asking if she was actually unsafe vs you just being uncomfortable; some jobs are about making the skeevy guys pay out the nose.\n\nSome of those places have management that protects the employees; some protect the customers. It's possible that this was a rare place where your daughter could safely make money hand over fist without noticing the grossness, but it's much more likely that her ignorance is a vulnerability. \n\nIt sounds like your daughter needs to hear more about what kinds of things can happen, how to recognize unsafe people, and how to protect herself from them. Gavin de Becker wrote a book called The Gift of Fear that, frankly, I think everyone should read in their mid to late teens. He also wrote Protecting the Gift, which is aimed at parents. If you haven't, I recommend reading them both and then giving the first one to your daughter to read and talk about.", "YTA.  She is going to have to deal with cat-calling, sexual harassment, and probably at least light stalking, if not much worse at some point.  Especially if she is a pedestrian in a city for any length of time.  It's better that she learn how to recognize it and deal with it.\n\nBy 16, I had already had a stalker, been followed as a pedestrian, and been followed when driving.  It's unfortunately part of growing up.", "NAH\n\nYou're trying to protect your kid, which is admirable, but the reality is she'll be getting those comments no matter what job she's at. I'm unclear what exactly her disability is, but if she can hold a job as a waitress then she can probably understand a conversation about what to watch out for from creepy customers and the importance of reporting such behaviors to her supervisor. \n\nI hate how strange men treat young women, especially minors, but there's really no job a minor is qualified for that doesn't involve interacting with potentially gross strangers. Teaching her to recognize when people are potentially being gross and how to advocate for herself would probably be the better move here, but like I said I don't understand her disability.", "YTA\n\nWhat are you going to do? Ban her from every situation with dodgy men? That\u2019s pretty much everything. \n\nIt would have been a lot better to teach her how to recognise this, what to do, who to ask for help etc. equip her with everything she needs to cope with harassment because god she\u2019s going to need it for years to come. \n\nInstead you\u2019ve effectively punished her for other peoples actions.", "NTA she may be bad now, but in the future hopefully she can agree with you. Personally I relate to this. I had my first job at 16 and I worked in a college area, so every customer at work assumed I was older. One time a customer got creepy, my managers stepped in and my mom came to get me(extremely grateful someone was there for me) I really wonder why management didn\u2019t get involved if this happened multiple times. Maybe you could\u2019ve talked to them first though. Either way minors should be protected everywhere. Maybe together you guys can find another job", "I kind of get the feeling from this post that it\u2019s being inflated to fit the overly protective dad theory, perfect opportunity to talk to your daughter about all the \u201cbads\u201d out in the world, but NOOO you went straight for the jugular, dude she is in a public place I get there are weirdo\u2019s out there but she will meet them in other places, would it have been BAD!! to have a discussion?", "YTA. You should have talked to the management if you were concerned, but she was happy and from her perspective didn't have any problems working there. \n\nDo you think it's actually unsafe, or did it just make you uncomfortable that they were looking at your child?", "I would say NTA, but at the same time I understand her frustration.

School is stressful enough. You could read her some of our comments as well, or let her read through them herself, to understand the severity of what those disgusting men were doing.

Your daughter and your sons/friends see you punishing *her* for something out of her control, and as bad as it is, totally regular in the public sphere. Now, she doesn't have a job, can't save money like she wanted, AND knows you'll just unilaterally decide she's quitting no matter the consequences to her future employment.

NTA, but I do see why she's upset. The sad reality is that female waitstaff are targets for that kind of behavior. Maybe see if the restaurant (or a different one) has a hostess position instead of actual serving until she's a little older.

I'd have wrapped her around them then threw in a couple staples just to be sure. These are the types of things that will happen IRL and she was doing fine handling it, probably even better when you were not there watching. For example, my husband is a southern gentleman who would never speak or act inappropriately with a minor. That being said, he calls everyone honey or sweetheart...like mrs or ms. He has that innate southern flirtation gene. All us southerners have it. Not a bit of it is predatory or sexual and it makes wait staff love him. Hes so sweet and genuine, all the time and he is interested in people...just to know more about them. Before the first sweetheart was uttered he probably found out quite a lot about her. You, eavesdropping, on a conversation hear \"no, thats okay sweetheart..just grab the check when you get a chance.....\"oh no, honey, shes just not hungry\". Not harmful but sounds like flirting if you havent been privy to the rest of the conversation What will she have to suffer while you look for another perfect position? Going forward, employers wont respect her if Mom had to organize and set up interview times, attend the interview with her, go in and just watch I know it's hard and a letting go quotient you haven't worked out just yet.  I have two special needs sons. 29 and 31 now. I had to increase my therapy visits to twice a week during the boys times of change...graduating grade school, middle school, high school. Even a change of teacher led to weeks of being unsettled which aggravated all.of it....argh. I also scheduled each of mine with a therapy appointment immediately following first day of work. The therapist they had a great rapport with would tell me if there was anything happening that was worrisome or uncomfortable....if she thought I needed to know something they would call me back in and we'd all talk about it.

Can't stop.her from getting older so back away, just a bit. Out of her sight at least. One more thing--stop, stopping by her place of work. Not doing her any favors. She won't be able to make friends of her coworkers if they see her as having a mother who is waaY to invasive. It will get her made fun of which is something that would break my heart...being such an over protective parent, that I caused additional bullying and teasing. I know you don't want that. It's such a high wire act....all of it. It's SO DAMN HARD!  You're in the throes of the worst parental nightmare. Our babies growing up. I don't mean to be as hateful as I was.

Another time was working retail and a dad came in with his kid and he was flirting with me - I was super uncomfortable and so was his daughter (the dad was probably in his late 50 and the daughter was in her 20s).", "NTA\nI have 16 year experience in the field. \n\nDon't you think they as a parent have tried to teach their child those lessons?  I know I have.  But that is a lesson they impacted children might never understand. And not for the lack of trying.\n\nChildren with special needs or disabilities often need guardianship and orconservatorship for protection once 18 for their protection against being exploited.\n\nDisabled individuals are some of the most exploited and victimized populations.\n\nI worked at a group home for those impacted.  Every client had been victimized in their youth. All of them.\n\nLike lured to their neighbors and bad stuff.\n\nPolice in my 1st world suburb area told me unless broken bones or SA, crimes against disabled individuals  aren't going to be looked into.  They are unreliable reporters.  \n\nThat means people aren't going to believe the disabled child, against someone with special needs.  Same with civil liability.  Their disability creates reasonable doubt.  And police are so stretched with resources that they just do not have it to use on it.  This is per a conversation with a police officer regarding the abuse of a disabled child.", "Sexual abuse towards people with disabilities is incredibly high. Like literally 50% of people with disabilities are abused. Depending upon the severity of her disability, they might not be able to teach her and her managers aren't keeping her safe. She needs someone to keep her safe. Nah.", "Some people with disabilities really never can be fully independent. There can be some independence, but not like most people. I've worked in special education for years and know I have had multiple students who would be *very* susceptible to sexual abuse/exploitation and would def be traumatized after the fact. Her job isn't keeping her safe and I wouldn't trust her managers to protect her, which is what she needs. Nah, but dad should look into sex ed programs that teach about consent and more supportive work places.", "But we don't know how bad.", "I have to say, I must have lead a charmed life because I have rarely seen the type of behavior people are describing here. Do I put to much trust in human nature to think that this is rare?", "I\u2019d be even more worried that she didn\u2019t notice it tbh. These men are predators and she lacks the ability to sense the danger. She needs to be aware that strange older men aren\u2019t her friends. Yes he can\u2019t protect her forever but she needs to be told what boundaries are.\n\nI\u2019d also like to know what restaurant she was working at that requires a short uniform? Usually even at hooters the younger girls are hostesses and have different dress codes. I doubt management cares about these customers actions, they\u2019re probably regulars and bring in money so they can do what they want", "As a child my mother wasn\u2019t allowed to answer the phone because it was so common for creeps to call random numbers (especially once they didn\u2019t have to go through a telephone operator and could just direct dial) and say obscene things or just breathe creepily into the phone.", "This should be the top comment.", "It depends on the nature and extent of her disability, right? \n\nMy government calls me disabled. I have epilepsy. \n\nI am very grateful my parents gave me the opportunity to build a solid foundation for independence during adolescence, including employment. It is probably one of the reasons I don\u2019t \u2018feel\u2019 disabled.\n\nSleazy men have always been there. Unless something radical happens, learning to deal with them is this is part of growing up and gaining independence.\n\nYou\u2019ve got experience in the field though, am I wrong?", "It\u2019s bad enough that she can\u2019t realize when older guys are being obviously sexual and creepy to her. He saw it with his own eyes and took action to protect his daughter. It\u2019s not necessarily infantilizing unless he doesn\u2019t have a conversation with her on being more self aware. It\u2019s like having a talk with any kid about stranger danger. Plus the people she worked/with or for had to have known how these customers were acting and still sent her out there with them. It wasn\u2019t a good environment for her", "Honestly yes and probably pretty sheltered if you\u2019ve never clocked it.", "Every journey is different. And it does depend on the childs specific diagnosis, strength and abilities. \n\nBased on OP  says  \"she didn't seem to get it (she never gets that kind of thing).\"\nThat to me is very telling.  Because it suggests they've tried and their child has never understood it.\n\nOPs daughter is an at risk (due to diagnosis  individual, and was working in a field that was putting her further at risk. \n\nYou mentioned having epilepsy.  There are things that you can medically do to support having that, and specific needs you have.  \n\nIs there anything you avoid due to it?  Would that be different?  \n\nIn that same way OPs daughter might need some form of extra  protection every day due to having \"*special needs.\"  And what that looks like will depend on their specific situation Because you are right sleazy people everywhere.  \n\nAnd she may get require extra support so she can have safety with her independence.  \nThat should not be shamed or blamed OP not doing enough to prepare their child.\n\nImpacted children go through various therapies, medications and schooling specific to support them to be able to function as independently as possible. \n\nAnd so freaking much of it is just trial and error.  Sometimes an intervention  works and sometimes it doesn't. So much time and money.\n\nOften for parents to be still told that their child will need some level of assistance daily living for the rest of their lives.  \n\nI was recently talking to a disabilities caseworker about that.  The number of parents that are like \"I need to live forever because I don't have anyone else to watch out for my kiddo after I die\"\n\nAnd yes, parents are absolutely doing everything they can to educate their child in a way (level, language) their child can understand.  To be independent and to be safe in the community.\n\n* \" special needs\" to me often is almost used as code amongst parents who find it too hard (emotionally)to call their children disabled.  A friend calls it sugar coating it.", "My dude, please don't mansplain women's experiences to the people who live them. \n\nI was a highly sheltered, naive \"good girl\" who didn't kiss a boy until I was 19. I had a massive, nearly overbearing social support network around me.\n\nI was still sexually harassed/low level assaulted at 13 (I was pulled into an adult man's lap nonconsentually and held there). I had creeper dudes my dad's age trying to get me, a minor, to go out with them. I was regularly hit on by a custodian at my first professional internship at 16. My first boyfriend stalked me for a month when I broke up with him. \n\nI had a support network that intervened and stopped bad things from continuing, but they can't stop them from happening. The OP needs to help his daughter understand what are warning signs, how to get help, and work with her manager to be certain she'll be supported when people cross the line. At 16, she's going to be an adult in two years, and unless the OP intends to keep her dependent on him for the rest of her adult life, no job or college or trade school, he needs to help her learn to deal with this life hazard. \n\nOtherwise, it's going to get bad when she's alone, when she has no manager or support network to turn to, and she's not going to know how to be safe.", "You may not have ever been SH'd, but statistics show that you're heavily in the minority.", ">but that is NOT normal.\n\nIt's not the case that most men act like that. So in that sense it's \"not normal.\"\n\nBut it is the case that *enough* men act like that that it's something most women have to deal with on a regular basis. A very small minority is enough when the behavior of that minority centers around seeking you out.\n\n> You have your personal experiences and I have mine.\n\nIf you're not a woman, your personal experiences aren't a counterexample. The only thing you can claim based on your experiences is that you don't act like that, and you don't see other men act like that. But nobody was claiming it's all men, and the ones that do change their behavior based on what third parties are around.", "This is a lovely answer. Thank you for putting in the effort. \n\nMy steer is that, based on the information provided, neither of us can tell whether \u201cmaking\u201d their daughter quit her job was the best course of action, but I don\u2019t doubt OP was trying to look after their daughters interests.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to tell, for example, how explicit the comments were (was it something every/most 16 year olds would pick up on? Or just their parents?) and whether there were other options for modifying the workplace (e.g. was management aware? Could they put safety protocols in place?).\n\nUltimately I think we agree, I don\u2019t want to blame OP. I do think every journey is different.\n\n(And yes, moving through the world with epilepsy involves a lot of, in your words, \u201ctrial and error\u201d, so there are changes!)", "Didn\u2019t even read your post because at no point did I \u201cmansplain\u201d anything. When was I condescending? I said that accepting sexual harassment is NOT normal. Anyone should be able to say that. Quit trying to throw around your flashy lib terms if you don\u2019t understand them.", "\\>I don\u2019t know where you come from or who you\u2019re around but that is NOT normal.\n\nThat's the condscending, mansplaining part. Most studies find that 80-90% of women have experienced sexual harassment. It is sadly a typical experience for the vast majority of us. \n\nChanging your argument to \"accepting sexual harassment isn't normal\" from \"the existence of sexual harassment isn't normal\" is a very different statement, but I think you know that.", "OK, so at what point should she be able to go out on her own? 18? 22? This should have been a teaching point rather than just extending her inexperience with dealing with gross people.", "She can't stay inside forever, she's becoming an adult, and anyone with special needs are even MORE likely to get taken advantage of and exploited, if he just shelters her she will NEVER be able to handle herself or know what to do in the almost guaranteed likelihood she will need to. I understand wanting to shield kids from everything, but it isn't healthy, and if he doesn't try to teach her what's appropriate and whats not, she is even more likely to be taken advantage of. It's not a happy point of life but sadly its inevitable.", "SMH, you don\u2019t even understand the definition of condescending. You sound like an awful parent. Now I\u2019m being condescending.", "That is a nuanced answer. We don\u2019t understand the extent of her special needs, but being that OP thought it was important to note, it\u2019s likely impactful. Doesn\u2019t change that fact that right now, his daughter is a minor, and he is responsible for her care.", "I seriously can't believe how many people are just throwing up their hands all, \"she needs to learn how to deal with being sexually harrassed on the reg!!! ALL women need to learn how to deal with that!\" completely ignoring the facts that: \n\na) Her special needs may in fact mean that she is not capable of recognising a dangerous situation, let alone protecting herself from one, and \n\nb) If more women walked out of low-paying jobs at the first sign of their workplace endorsing sexual harrassment, a whole lot of shitty workplaces might suddenly become less tolerant of these asshole customers purely because they don't want to deal with the inconvenience of their staff walking out on them. \n\nI seriously can't tell whether everybody here is just stupidly jaded, or if this is some kind of paying the trauma forwards BS, but it seems like you're the only sane person in this post.", "If her special needs prevent her from recognizing the situation innately and all he does is take her out of it, what happens when she's sexually harassed in a new situation without a manager and the legal protections of being a minor?\n\nThis is the unfortunate social equivalent of learning defensive driving for women - a protective measure because people won't follow the rules, and can be irresponsible and dangerous. I hate that it's part of what women have to learn to navigate. It's not good that it's happening to her, but pretending that it won't happen again is naive. Unless her father intends to keep her as a dependent under his direct supervision for the rest of her adult life, this will be a problem she will encounter again. She needs to be given the skills to recognize the danger and take appropriate steps to keep herself safe.", "Thank you! Dudes just trying to be a good father, which we don\u2019t see a lot of anymore, and these victim card holders just want to shit on him."]}
