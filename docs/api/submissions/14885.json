Most recipients are put on wait lists, which can take awhile. I've treated her for Pilonidal cysts, I've treated her kids for asthma (which she had no idea he had because her doctor was a moron and thought the kid was faking it because he has ODD and behavioral issues), treated her other son for poison ivy, etc etc. We are on a first name basis and she is a damn good woman.

She is a damn good mom. \n\nWhere she has a history of pilonidal cysts and again, most places put her on waiting lists to have them surgically removed, she comes in at least once every 4 months to have them drained and put on antibiotics. Last time I saw her was December. She came in last night (I wasn't working) and the staff made her wait, in a sitting position, for over 6 hours and they were taking in people who came in after her, which they deemed \"more severe\". She ended up leaving due to pain from sitting down. She came back this morning, as she knew I'd be working. She was bent clear over, crying when she entered the ER. She could hardly walk. Her heart rate was 176 so I had to run an emergency EKG. When I got her to that room (IMMEDIATELY) and saw her cyst, I nearly fainted. She was crying, telling me two of my senior coworkers made her sit the entire time because shes pregnant and didnt want her to faint and scare other patients. No water was offered. No pain management was offered. No food was offered. Nothing at all. They all know she's pregnant. It's in her file. I drain the cyst myself. I get her bandaged. I give her antibiotics and then I go to track down the two coworkers who left her in that position last night. \n\nThey basically told me that she didn't ask for pain management, food or water (all of our machines are down and cameras show her going up to the desk several times so I'm not sure I believe that). Regardless, she's pregnant, she was crying in pain. Don't be stupid. By the time she walked out and I caught the last of her on camera, she was throwing up in the bushes on her hands and knees. I immediately reported it and I was quite forward about it. I was fucking livid. They pulled the two coworkers in immediately following reviewing the tapes and they were told to leave, pending investigation with no pay.

I don't know the standart procedure but ethically they should've asked when they see a pregnant women crying over pain if she wants food/water/pain treatment etc. You've done a good thing by chasing them down.
