Would agree 1000%", "It's awful they wouldn't believe you. Disgusting. Like you wouldn't know.", "Jumping on this because Omg, 100% truth. I've also had a pilonidal cyst & I'd rather give birth again. I'd rather have dental work completed without novocaine while listening to Nickelback. \nA pilonidal cyst will drop you to your knees & make you beg to be struck by lightning just to be put out of your misery.\n\nAgreed... those other nurses need to be fired & karma needs to gift them their own pilonidal cyst to enjoy. \n\nHugs to you, I wish you relief & quick healing!!", "Those are my concerns as well.  But I'll admit that I'm coming at this only knowing about the U.S. in any depth, and maybe the division of duties among doctors, nurses, admins, and social workers varies from here to wherever OP works.\n\nEdited to add: To be fair, I feel like OP wouldn't have bothered to report the colleagues and then turn around and break a huge rule immediately?  But who knows, there does seem to be a loss of professionalism here with this particular patient.", "It sounds like someone who spent the day in the ER waiting room and watched some greys anatomy. It literally makes no sense.", "Agreed. We need a lot more info from OP. Also this would be much more appropriate if posted on a healthcare subreddit. Why would you post this on AITA? The average layperson knows zilch about how ERs run. Of course you\u2019ll be voted NTA here. I\u2019d suggest putting this on a healthcare subreddit and actually mentioning that night\u2019s staffing, acuity, wait times, and if the ED was full and waiting on floor beds. Were there traumas being run? Ambulances coming in? As a healthcare worker, you know all this is relevant! \n\nAre you a nurse, doctor, tech? How do you have access to security tapes?\n\nAgain, it\u2019s odd you posted this here and not on a healthcare subreddit.", "Yeah, it sounds like those \"nurses\" were criminally negligent. Maybe the patient should file charges AND a lawsuit? She could have died thanks to their appalling lack of care.", "So they're the types of people who retaliate against the most vulnerable people they can get their hands on in proxy for real and imagined slights... including the slights of toddlers having medical emergencies.\n\nI hope they never have patients again.\n\nI'm pretty sure the no-favorites rule is more about not giving a patient preferential or poor treatment based on how much you like them, not about forming a positive relationship with patients you see frequently and are genuinely decent. You're well in the right, so long as you'd report them for similar behavior against other patients.", "I wanted to add, what happens when a patient shows up at the ED and immediately asks for pain treatment?\n\nThey go on the \"possibly seeking opiates\" watch list.", "NTA, good for you!", "Also a nurse and I don\u2019t believe this post for a second. Even with all the boundaries being crossed, this is not how this works and the stuff she mentions is out of her scope and there\u2019s no way she can just review security cameras like that lol plus the constant - I\u2019m awesome and she helped the mom get into med school with her \u201ctips\u201d what? Lol", "I was thinking the same thing about boundaries. I am also an ER nurse. I do not know what the state of the ED was that evening but if it was a kick butt night there, a 6 hour wait for a polynoidal cyst would not be unheard of based on triage metrics. There is a great deal of information missing such as the initial vital signs and was there a fast triage with vital signs. Others stated moving the patient ahead due to her non emergent state. Laws state every patient must see an emergency room physician so to move her ahead would mean a doctor would need to be pulled away also. \nI am unsure why this patient continues using the ER as a doctors room considering this relationship has gone on for months, as evidenced by the writer\u2019s dialogue. By now, even with waiting lists, she should have a primary provider. I feel her personal relationship with this patient is what compels her to return.  She has made her case based on defense of her actions offers excuses for it. It is great that the writer is full of empathy and compassion but she certainly crossed lines IMHO. Allowing the patient to make a complaint to management and even facilitating it is one thing. She was playing Inspector Gadget. Trust in your coworkers is a real thing. After this she may need to find another job. The heat is going to get intense.", "Sometimes regular ER patient the hospital I go to I have an idea of who is working when because I\u2019ve been there so often and the staff work certain hours. Depending on the situation I do wait until certain people are there because I know they understand my needs (mental health).", "Yes I agree.  Never given my schedule to a patient (unless a legit friend texted and asked if I was on that day), never reviewed cameras.  The other thing I wondered about was the I&D.  Not in a nurse's scope anywhere I have worked, and I have worked in three states", "I'm not sure which country OP is in, but in my country (the UK), all ER/A&E waiting area seats are super hard without any padding (most likely, to clean easily). I've had to sit on these seats with a kidney infection and pancreatitis and that was intolerable so I can only imagine how a pilonidal cyst on a hard seat must feel.", "And it's often hard to get the whole sac out because of the area, so they often recur.", "It's also often the case that women's pain is ignored during triaging. I was in for abdominal pain so bad i couldn't sit. I was pacing the waiting room. For nearly 30 hours. Turns out my liver was inflamed from infection. Like, I'm quite fat, and the doctor could see a noticeable bulge from it while i was lying on the exam table. She was pissed at those nurses. \n\nAnd lemme tell you. Those intravenous antibiotics are something.", "On the flip side side, when the doctor squeezed mine out the pain was almost orgasmic. It was simultaneous pain and instant relief.\n\nBefore that I was just pacing around swigging from a bottle of JD because I couldn't sit, lie down, stand still, do anything without extreme pain", "I was absolutely miserable with mine and it came out of nowhere. I had it surgically removed and it thankfully hasn't come back.", "This feels like something that more than deserves the investigation! And senior management/HR whoever you reported to seem to agree.", " Even with all the boundaries being crossed, this is not how this works and the stuff she mentions is out of her scope.", "who comes in with their arm hanging off or their internal organs trying to escape out their abdomen", "Feel like they had to ask it in this sub because they knew they could fan the anti-nurse flames and people in here generally don\u2019t have an understanding of how triage works, and therefore can\u2019t point out all the things in this story that are off. \n\nI\u2019m glad I\u2019m not the only one that caught that! Def seems like taking credit for a huge accomplishment. You don\u2019t get into med school because you got good \u201ctips\u201d", "Nursing is an incredibly difficult profession, but nursing school and medical school are two different fields. Aside from things that people in all academically rigorous programs learn like how to study well, apply to schools, build a resume I don't know what tips a nurse could give about medical school. \n\nAnd no security team is going to let just any regular coworker have access to security tapes, especially in a hospital where things like health information and patient confidentiality could be an issue. That sort of thing goes to department heads, HR, lawyers etc. The people with real power to determine whether inadequate care was provided and discipline accordingly. \n\nI'm chronically ill and can almost buy knowing someone's schedule. I know which nurses are on at times/days I'll get my injections and the nurse & reception staff by name. But hospitals, even small hospitals have huge numbers of staff. I landed in a small college town hospital with just 6 ER beds and even there I saw 10+ nurses floating around. Something isn't right here.", "I literally thought the same thing. Former ER nurse here. I don\u2019t buy her tips got the woman in med school of all things. We aren\u2019t allowed to drain cysts independently. We certainly don\u2019t just review tapes\u2026this post is fake af", "I do understand that, but too many other things just seemed off. I hope you get the support you need when you go. I know the ER can be hard for mental health. I know my hospital is working to improve it and I hope you are getting what you need. \ud83d\udc9c", "Yes exactly. I work as a flight nurse and sometimes have a higher scope and unfortunately have had a pilonidal myself. A nurse would never preform and I&D. It would be an APP or an MD/DO. There will things throughout this post that needed addressing on both sides. Also on if there is concern that she is septic, my need surgery or a procedure for this she should be kept NPO and given IVF if indicated. Obviously pain meds though. The boundaries here are what concerned me.", "Idk where OP is either but they are possibly worse in America. I know, not hard to believe. Went to the ER in August of 2020, pain in my abdomen that felt like I was being stabbed (turned out to be a cut gastroenteritis, don\u2019t wish it on my worst enemy m, though I was going to die), hadn\u2019t eaten for about 12 hours as I threw up everything and anything I ingested. Had to wait almost two hours in an empty waiting room. \n\nAll I wanted to do was lay down and I had to do that in the floor because the seats were built in a way that was impossible. They were hard as a rock and the arm rests were even built in a way that you couldn\u2019t use them for relief. 0/10 do not recommend.\n\nEdit: Ended up spending three nights in the hospital and got a sweet $55k hospital bill that I had to fight with my insurance over. \n\nAin\u2019t America great.", "Just to point this out again:\n\n> two of my senior coworkers made her sit the entire time because shes pregnant and didnt want her to faint and scare other patients. \n\nMade. Her. Sit.\n\nThey gave a direction to a patient that increased their pain and discomfort because they didn\u2019t want to \u201cscare\u201d other people.\n\nAs for whether or not the patient was triaged properly - records will show whether or not that\u2019s true.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t defend telling someone to wait in a position that causes them more pain.", "[bot comment :(](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12nj0zb/aita_for_reporting_my_senior_coworkers_and/jgex1o1/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3)", "Honestly, I could have gone on and on about why this post isn\u2019t even close to being true, but whatever, they want to start some weird drama against nurses - good luck lol", "Happy cake day!\n\nThat sounds horrific! I've had severe pancreatitis 4 times in 16 months (the pain has been proven to be worse than child birth) and have had appendicitis, kidney infections and so forth. All cost me nothing because the UK has the NHS for universal healthcare.", "That\u2019s crazy that you could see the chief complaint through a camera. Unless you somehow were able to find the patients name and match it with the person on the camera? And then access their charts? Which I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t, because that would def be a HIPAA violation of course", "I\u2019m shocked so many \u201cER nurses\u201d seem to be jumping at this lol.
