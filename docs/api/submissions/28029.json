He had little respect for you when he made the jokes clearly. And if he keeps saying it and says it's a joke, it's probably not a joke, but his actual views he may be spinning off as a \"joke\". Those jokes are absolutely sexist and unfunny. You weren't in the wrong for feeling upset by them. Good on the women in the family for telling him off", "NTA -- and someone who keeps telling these kind of jokes, over and over again, *isn't* just joking. DTFA.", "NTA\n\nYeah, that misogynistic \"humor\" needs to end. It's not funny, it's not appropriate.", "If he didn't want it repeated in front of the other members of his family, perhaps he should grant his wife the same respect by not saying it to her.\n\nNTA", "NTA  Your husband's jokes are insulting and degrading to women.  Good for you telling his sister and the others.  Your husband needed to know how women felt about comments like that.  Being embarassed was a good consequence for his behavior.  If he doesn't like the consequences then he should keep his mouth shut.", "NTA\n\nYour husband sounds sexist. Is he starting to listen to podcast too?\n\nLemme tell you an offensive joke so stop being offended, it's a joke! You have no sense of humor!\n\nI hope your SIL and pals flay him alive.", "He\u2019s blaming YOU for what HE said. Don\u2019t buy into this silliness. NTA", "No one makes racist jokes anymore because it\u2019s not funny and actually racist to do that. He probably would never do that, yet. Same for sexist jokes. Tell him to grow up and work on himself. NTA", "NTA. I love your SILs", "NTA it doesn\u2019t matter that it\u2019s a joke if your husband keeps repeating it and repeating after you told him several times that it bothers you ( I\u2019m assuming). You have to clearly tell him the \u201cjoke\u201d isn\u2019t funny if he repeats it so much it comes off as him truly meaning it but hiding behind \u201cit\u2019s just a joke\u201d thing.\n\nAnd even if that isn\u2019t his intention he should at the very least be understandable that it bothers you and not do it again, and say sorry. It\u2019s sad how many people haven\u2019t learned to empathise and apologise but instead try to validate themselves and him telling you you\u2019re overreacting. Personally I can\u2019t with people like that.", "Ask him \"why do you think something that sexist could possibly be considered a joke? Who told you that was an acceptable attitude?\" \n\n\"Do you honestly believe that is an appropriate attitude to have?\" \n\nThese answers will let you know if this is a relationship that can be saved or not.", "NTA\n\nThere\u2019s always a grain of truth in every joke.", "NTA it seems likely he will make jokes like this again, and he may be a perfect candidate for the strategy of asking him to explain why the joke is funny.  \"I don't get it\". \"Why is that funny?\"  Get him to deconstruct the joke, and explain why hurting someone he loves is funny.", "NTA. In particular because you\u2019ve already asked him to cut that shit out. Regardless, it was an idiotic and unfunny comment and he should have apologized.", "NTA \n\nGood for you for calling him out, and love to the girls in the fam for having your back!", "NTA\n\nYour husband is. Sexism being his \u201chumour\u201d is a red flag actually and the fact that he tried saying you don\u2019t have a sense of humour because you wouldn\u2019t let him disrespect you is another red flag.", "Nta. As I like to say, if you have to tell me it's a joke, it isn't funny.", "INFO\nDo you do more for him than he does for you?\nDoes he expect you to do all the house work? Cooking? \nDo you work?\n\nI'm wondering why he thinks like this.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
