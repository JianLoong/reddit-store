If he's not willing to help out in the house he lives in then I personally think he should be paying for someone to clean/meals out/takeout food out of his own money. Why should it all be on you when you're already busy working? Tell him to pick up a damn broom or wash a dish if he's not happy with that idea.", "NTA but hire a man/boy to come by and do some housework and meal prep.", "NTA, and I don't think you're being controlling by stating the fact that the money to hire help has to come out of the budget somewhere. He's a grown man, he can pick up a vacuum cleaner.", "NTA  \n\nYou're not wrong. And it's not that difficult.\n\n>hasn't found anything he wants to do since\n\nSeems to me there's your trouble, maybe? \n\nMight be worth asking him, what IS he doing all day while you're gone? Is he watching TV, on social media, puttering in the basement, gambling online, walking the dogs, depressed, stepping out, sleeping, what....?", "NTA, you are right.\n\nYou also aren't controlling, because you aren't forcing him to clean, you are willing to hire someone to do the house chores (obviously such person needs to be payed).", "NTA. You are totally right. Patriarchy at its finest. \n\nPlease hire someone for your couple\u2019s sake, with BOTH your money (actually it should only be His money since you did the house management during your stay at home time).\nIf he is not happy: HE DOES THE CHORES! \n\nGood luck \ud83d\udcaa", "NTA. TBQH, he sounds depressed, but he's not going to get better if he's sitting around. Talking about money sets him off, so obviously it's about money, but I think he feels emasculated. You're the bread winner while he isn't bringing in money, and now you want him to clean the house: role reversal. Your kids don't see it that way because the next generation doesn't care about roles, \"men's work\" and \"women's work\", but I think he still does. He was fine, before, because you were doing the cleaning and cooking, and now that's supposed to be him? He needs to stop feeling sorry for himself and help out or find a job.", "Sounds like your husband has a nice dose of misogyny coursing in his veins. Of course YOU maintained the home and cooked when you were the one staying at home - YOU'RE A WOMAN. THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO!!!! He is above such demeaning tasks.\n\nTell him to get off his ass.", "NTA.  It is strange but although you are using money to control him it does not seem like financial abuse.  You guys have money and if you have enough to retire without him working the last few years of his career you must be doing okay.  May I ask what you are doing for work?", "NTA That shouldn't take too many hours to do as far as cleaning. I have sympathy with the cooking though. It is hard to come up with something to cook every day, and I hate it.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m too lazy to do chores so I spend a portion of my fun money to hire someone to do it (including my wife\u2019s share of the chores), I think it\u2019s fair that it counts despite my wife still complaining occasionally that I don\u2019t do much around the house.", "NTA. He should do his share for the household. He also should not be involving your children in your martial issues. I understand they are grown, but it\u2019s not healthy for anyone.", "Nope. NTA- He does have a point about the money, but it sounds like you tried to communicate this numerous ways. It also sounds like he needs something to do outside the home. Some people really do not do well retired. They need a job to keep them forced into a routine that keeps them moving and engaged. And if he has just become a couch potato it is dangerous for his health and mental well being.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
