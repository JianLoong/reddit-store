Is he watching TV, on social media, puttering in the basement, gambling online, walking the dogs, depressed, stepping out, sleeping, what....?", "NTA, you are right.\n\nYou also aren't controlling, because you aren't forcing him to clean, you are willing to hire someone to do the house chores (obviously such person needs to be payed).", "NTA. You are totally right.

You're the bread winner while he isn't bringing in money, and now you want him to clean the house: role reversal. Your kids don't see it that way because the next generation doesn't care about roles, \"men's work\" and \"women's work\", but I think he still does. He was fine, before, because you were doing the cleaning and cooking, and now that's supposed to be him? He needs to stop feeling sorry for himself and help out or find a job.", "Sounds like your husband has a nice dose of misogyny coursing in his veins.

He should do his share for the household. He also should not be involving your children in your martial issues. I understand they are grown, but it\u2019s not healthy for anyone.", "Nope. NTA- He does have a point about the money, but it sounds like you tried to communicate this numerous ways. It also sounds like he needs something to do outside the home. Some people really do not do well retired. They need a job to keep them forced into a routine that keeps them moving and engaged.

What you\u2019re describing is just budgeting. \n\nI\u2019ll be \ud83d\udcaf. \n\nI want to use a cleaning service. \n\nI talked about it with my husband. \n\nI would also like to go on a specific nice vacation this year which runs us about 4k for a week at an all inclusive resort on a beach. \n\nI also would like for us to continue charitable giving, which is roughly 10k a year for us. \n\nWhere can I get the cleaning service money from out of the budget?\n\nI can try to earn more money to cover the service. Or I can reduce or eliminate current discretionary expenses. \n\nI regularly get full spa days: mani, pedi, facial, everything that can be waxed. It can easily run up to about $3k a year after tips. I live in Boston and tip about 40% because I use a really good but inexpensive salon. \n\nI have to decide \u2014 would I rather get my hands dirty (and then manicured) by doing cleaning myself? Or do I want to get a cleaner but not have my spa days? \n\nHow often do we want cleaners? What service? Maybe I can get eyebrows done but not dip manicures. Whatever. I could in theory reduce my tip rate. But to me, it wouldn\u2019t feel right. So the only option is reducing the number of spa services I get or not hiring cleaners. \n\nThis is how people budget.

Your husband is not being a good member of the household you share.\n\nI agree with others that he obviously has a misogynistic streak.

It can be very enjoyable. I don\u2019t know how you could encourage that, without knowing him.

You have sufficient income to hire a cleaner, but it takes away from other luxuries, that's a choice he's making.
