I'd go home for breaks/comfort of home.\n\nThey came home for 2 weeks last summer and we all lived in the house. For the rest of it it was just J and I. I was working and coming home to mess and J having anger outbursts. He would scream at then ignore me, slam doors, and one night went missing after going out with this friend, \"O\". O came to my house at 3am and we went to look for J. The whole time O was saying how fit he was etc. and he started doing push ups in the road. I was uncomfortable and wanted to find J.\n\nBack at uni and J and I have a good, supportive relationship. J is graduating and doing a 4th year nearer home, so wants to move back. I've got no problem, it would be nice for him to be there.\n\nHe wants O to move in. O lives nearby already. He would pay \u00a3200/month to my parents for their room, and go home as and when my parents came home . My parents room is the place I've gone to cry since they left and I don't want it changed, which might be selfish. I want it the same for when they return. my mum refused to rent out the house when she left as it wouldn't be home anymore, so i feel she'd dislike it to.\n\nJ took the no badly and made a scene at lunch calling me selfish and unreasonable, saying I always have been. I've always supported him so that hurt.\n\nI don't want to stay there with O as I don't know or trust him and want to be able to relax. With my BPD I can have loud, weeping meltdowns that I dont want him to see or make fun of. I also feel I wouldn't be able to exist comfortably or use communal spaces, or wear shorts etc.\n\nI struggle with the idea of a stranger using my things and treating my house as their own. I know how boys live, I don't trust him to stay out of my room, not damage things etc. \n\nI live with strangers at uni and I don't want it at home too. O has a full time job and if he wants to move out from his parents' I don't see why it can't be elsewhere. J says he will be lonely in the house without O. I get that and I'm ok with visitors and sleepovers.\n\nJ will still be taking a student loan next year and I suggested he use this to rent a house with O, but he said he can't afford it though he uses the loan for rent here where its more expensive. He says he can't get a part-time job though I've always had one.\n\nI think it's generous of my parents to let him live there free (and me), so it's a bit much to move a stranger in too. Its like the house is equally ours atm, but with O it would be way more J's than mine.\n\nMy parents sided with me and said they expected a no, and they would do the same in my situation.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1682777651, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/132tz4t/aita_for_saying_my_brother_cant_move_his_friend/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
