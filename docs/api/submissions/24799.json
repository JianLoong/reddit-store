Create your own family, surround yourself with those that love you for YOU. My husband and I have done that and it's amazing. I am 44F married to a 47M.

She only ever saw all the things *she* wanted for me, and she saw that as the only path to my happiness. Any deviation from that path was regarded as a poor decision, met with judgement and \u201cwell meaning\u201d advice, and frequently resulted in her taking action to try and sabotage my plans so she could try and set me back down the path to what *she* felt would make me happy.\n\nAnd while mourning the loss of my mother is still difficult, I\u2019ve come to realize that a big part of that is sadness about giving up on something I always wanted - a mom who loved me without strings attached and could be happy for my success.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry your mom has been so terrible to you.

I think what OP was trying to express was that 1. HE talked to a bunch of lawyers who reassured him that his mom didn't have a cause of action against him and that 2. OP's mom was told roughly the same thing by a bunch of lawyers she tried to get to take her case. There is such a thing as fraudulent inducement to contract (ie, getting someone to agree to a contract using false statements or whatnot). While I'm not too familiar with the law on this particular cause of action (contract attys, feel free to chime in?), I'm fairly certain that OP's mom wouldn't have a case. In my experience, a lot of people who threaten others with lawsuits (especially unreasonable people who are generally ignorant and beholden to their own unexamined biases) have no real concept of what it takes to actually win a lawsuit.\n\nAlso, OP, sorry that your mom is awful.

From where I'm standing it looks like SHE is trying to manipulate YOU.  Generally I'm mostly conservative, but I try to keep an open mind.

OP called all the lawyers and they \"understood\" 2. Mom couldn't find a lawyer to take the case. If OP said that he called all the lawyers in town to *prevent* his mother from obtaining legal counsel and that, as a result, she couldn't find anyone to sue him, that'd be different. Although in that case I'd also question OP's credibility because, again, that's not how lawyers work.
