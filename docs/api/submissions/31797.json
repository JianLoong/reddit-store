{"id": 31797, "submission_id": "184hitq", "title": "AITA for asking my son to bring my 6 week old granddaughter to visit me, without his fianc\u00e9?", "selftext": "Throwaway. 51f, my son is 29 and he and his fianc\u00e9 \"Jen\" have a 6 week old daughter \"Lily\" (she also has a 7yo son that is not mg sons child but I still consider him my grandbaby). I used to get along really well with Jen and told everyone she was like a daughter to me. But when she got pregnant, she started acting weird toward me. Like I asked to be in the room for delivery and she said a clipped \"no\" (despite letting her 7yo sons dads mom in the room for his delivery). No big deal, its her choice. But when I went to visit in the hospital afterwards she acted really put off that I was there. I figured she was just tired and left after 20 minutes to give her space. But then it continued.\n\nI have stopped in to see everyone about 5 times since she had the baby and every single time that I walk in, she gets really quiet. Whenever I'm holding the baby she is hovering. She keeps snapping at me over small things. Like how I'm holding the baby (had her on her belly on my arm or sideways across my knees on her belly) because \"she's crying, obviously she doesn't like that so stop\". Or snapping at me for things I say to the baby (like when she starts fussing, I said \"you won't get your own way with me, you cant play me like that\" in a baby voice, trying to calm her) and she goes \"she's 4 weeks old, how exactly is she playing you?\" Then she got livid and actually kicked me out of the house one time because she picked up the baby for making the smallest of noises and I told her the baby was going to get used to being held all the time if she kept doing that and she said \"well it's a good thing she's my child and I don't have to listen to your crying it out bullshit\". Well, I went there on Thanksgiving and apparently it was her mother's first time meeting the baby and of course the baby was all smiles and loved her grandma. But when I got the chance to hold the baby, she immediately started screaming and was promptly taken from me. I feel very slighted. I asked my son if he would bring the baby to visit me without his fianc\u00e9 because I feel like his fianc\u00e9s attitude toward me is the reason why the baby screams every time I hold her. I definitely think she's picking up on the hostility. I don't know why she even dislikes me now but asking her currently would be pointless. He told me he absolutely would not bring his daughter to my place without her mother because he wouldn't do that to his fianc\u00e9 (who has never been away from the baby thus far). I told him they were purposely ruining my chance at a relationship with my granddaughter and he said that wasn't true and that I need to stop \"pushing\" my old fashioned beliefs, which is the first time I've heard of this.

Nobody is \"trying to ruin\" a relationship but \\*YOU\\*.\n\nThis reads like you're extremely pushy with them. If anyone is ruining a relationship, it's you. I'm guessing that won't be your first self-fulfilling prophecy.", "YTA \n\nSo many things to unpack here. \n\n1. You want to separate your 6 week year old granddaughter from her mother? What about feedings? Ever thing of that? \n2. Did you ask if you could come to the hospital to visit or did you just show up? You sound bitter she wouldn't let you in the delivery room. Why would she? It's her choice, but you're upset by that choice.\n3. You sound like you're holding the baby completely wrong and your criticizing how she's taking care of her kid. \n\nIt sounds like you are ruining your own chances because of your hostile behavior. It's pretty understandable why she is watchful of you.  I bet there's ton more you have done but are leaving out.", "YTA. Time to back off a bit, clearly.   You should have NEVER ASKED to be in the delivery room.   You then go on to be very dismissive about who she did invite.   If you think you kept that attitude to yourself, know that you most certainly didn\u2019t.   \n\nThe \u2018I don\u2019t have to listen to your crying it out bullshit\u2019 is VERY telling.  You\u2019ve obviously given much unsolicited and unwanted advice.\n\nLet them make their own way.   If they ask for advice or opinions,  give it.\n\nAsking for him to bring the baby alone is going to cut no ice with your son I\u2019m GLAD to hear.   \n\nRead the room mom/ grandma.\n\nBack.  Off.  \n\nRespect that SHE IS THIS CHILD\u2019S MOTHER.", "YTA, sorry. Telling your future DIL that she shouldn't hold the baby all the time because \"the baby is going to get used to it\" incorporated three errors, and it seems like you didn't notice any of them. So I would guess that you have done a lot of other problematic things you haven't noticed and this is raising your future DIL's hackles. The first error you made in that one instance was, you criticized her parenting. Never criticize a child-in-law's parenting unless it's a matter of life and death. The second error you made was that you used \"I'm older and know better\" logic to contradict her. That never goes down well because it comes across as controlling - but also, modern parents generally believe that parenting techniques have improved over the decades, so your \"old fashioned\" advice is going to be assumed to be wrong. You might as well tell her not to use a carseat, that's how credible she will take your 30-years-old parenting advice to be. The third error you made, and possibly the worst, is that you treated her like she has no idea how to be a mom when she actually already has a 7 year old. This isn't her first time around the block, and you ignoring that, will be taken, correctly, to be demeaning.\n\nYou've already described three things you did that are destined to antagonize her but you describe all of them as if they were completely fine: asking to be in the delivery room (you're supposed to wait to be invited, and, if not invited, you say nothing), telling the baby \"You won't get your own way with me\" (which, maybe was just said jokingly, but in context of your other mistakes, maybe not), and telling her she shouldn't hold the baby all the time. \n\nI'll give you a pass on holding the baby a way your DIL didn't like. As long as you weren't doing anything actively dangerous, I think your DIL should not treat you like you're an idiot who has never held a baby before. That is hostile and controlling on her part. However you'll get nowhere confronting her about it, if something like that happens again, the person you should speak to is your son. \n\nThe best way to interact with your DIL is not to tear down her choices but to build her up. \"I love how much you play with the baby, you're a really good mom.\" \"I love how you've encouraged your son to be such an attentive big brother.\" Help out where you can, but ask first: \"Would you like me to make you a quick lunch while you feed the baby? What would you like?\" \"Would you like me to read a story to \\[older child\\] while you put Rosa down for a nap?\" \n\nI think you did correctly by addressing your concerns to your son rather than your future DIL but asking him to bring the baby without his fiance was not the right way to go about it. I think it was fine for you to say you felt unwelcome and that your DIL behaves in a hostile manner towards you, but probably would have been better if you had followed that with something like, \"What can I do to make this better?\" \n\nI totally feel for you. I'm a mom with no daughters, only sons. Although I've made HUGE efforts to include my in-laws in my children's lives, I definitely see that most mothers don't make the same effort and some are pretty active about centering all their activities on their own parents and excluding their husband's parents. So I could easily be in your situation in future. At the same time, I also see the ways my MIL and FIL, albeit nice people, have undermined me and demeaned me in their zeal to be The Authority Over Our Grandkids And Center of All Things, and I can totally understand how life-sucking that is for a DIL.", "You don't know why she dislikes you? You never heard anyone saying you were pushing your beliefs before? Really? Because I've been reading this for 30 seconds and I know exactly why she dislikes you, and it's because you are pushing your beliefs on her.\n\nYTA. You are making this whole situation about you. Let them be a family together. Let them set the rules for how the baby is cared for, unless they are doing something objectively dangerous. (\"You might spoil the baby if you pick her up\" is not objectively dangerous.) Let go of how you were deprived of what you seem to think is your right to be present at one of the most vulnerable moments of her life.\n\nYou can't ruin a relationship with a 6 week old baby. But you're well on your way to ruining the relationships with your son and daughter in law. Back way, way off if you ever hope to be welcome in their lives.", "YTA. \n\nYou create this problem by being an AH. \n\nSeriously. Telling a newborn that they \u201cwon\u2019t get their way with you and can\u2019t play you\u201d is absolutely pathetic. \n\nAnd who tf cares if she picks her up for small noises? It\u2019s literally been proven that you can\u2019t spoil a newborn. \n\nYou damn well know you\u2019re the problem. They\u2019ve made that abundantly clear with what they\u2019ve told you when you visited. \n\nStop acting like a victim. No one is buying a damn thing you\u2019re saying.", "I\u2019m actually gonna give you the benefit of the doubt for a quick second - but whilst also telling you YTA. Please read what I say because this is important. \n\n1- most first time moms end up feeling they compromised things they wish they hadn\u2019t (ex-MiL in the delivery room was probably one of those things. They don\u2019t often make those mistakes a second time.\n\n2- crying it out IS harmful. Even if it wasn\u2019t, not your baby, not your choice - and the wording you used was undermining and passive aggressive as fuck!\n\n3- you gave birth to your child/ren in a VERY different time. We know more now than we did then. Don\u2019t come at anyone with your \u201csurvivor bias\u201d bullshit, there IS a reason baby/child mortality rates are so much lower now.\n\n4- this ISN\u2019T your baby. You are not entitled to ANYTHING from your son, his partner or the baby.\n\n5- from the way you wrote it, you didn\u2019t ASK if you could go to the hospital, you knew the baby had been born and rocked the fuck up like an entitled asshole\n\nI\u2019m sure there is more I could pick apart, but I will leave you with this\u2026\u2026.we don\u2019t have to rely on our mothers/MiL\u2019s like you think we do. You are a peripheral family member that can quickly become a cut-off one. You\u2019re not feeding financing or fucking either of them, so your opinion holds no weight. If you want to be involved it will only be on their terms and no other, the baby is more likely picking up on YOUR hostility. \n\nThe ONLY redeeming thing I can say about anything you have written is that you either raised your son (or allowed him the space) to learn how to be a supportive partner. You are going to quickly learn you need to fix up or you will be put out in the cold. \n\nIf you want any chance at salvaging this you need to reflect and (if you actually mean it) make a full apology for overstepping. If it was because you are excited then say so, but mention it as a reason and not an excuse. ASK them both if there is anything you can do to help them, a meal service, dropping food on the porch, laundry you can pick up and deliver back (again, without going inside or disturbing them if that\u2019s what they want), taking the oldest out for a few hours doing something they would want to do etc. Additionally, she may have come into the relationship with a child but they\u2019re now a unit of 4, you either have two grandchildren there or none!", "I have stopped in 5 times since she had the baby.\n\nYTA\n\nDid you even ask if you could come in? New mothers DO NOT want people to just walk into their house,you do not hold a 6 week old on their belly,giving her advice she does not want as well is a no unless she asks for it.Did you even ask to come to the hospital or did you come along uninvited?\n\nThey are not purposely ruining your chances at knowing your granddaughter,you are!", "YTA. Stop working against the mom and try to work WITH her. She has a new baby while also having to parent her other child. It\u2019s a busy and stressful time. The most annoying thing as a mom with a new baby is to be told you\u2019re doing something wrong. You are likely doing and saying things that is upsetting or off putting for Jen and making her uncomfortable. It may help to let this situation settle for a bit, then try to make amends with her so you guys can be more comfortable around each other. You need to respect how she and your son are choosing to parent.", "YTA. Talk about main character syndrome! She is perfectly allowed to say no to you being in the delivery room. It's up to her who she has there. She is the priority not you.\n\nOfc she is hovering! She's a new mum to a 6 week old. Have you forgotten what that was like? Where's your understanding? And then you criticise her for comforting a six week old? What's the big deal with a baby getting used to being held? It's a baby? Honestly that kind of nonsense is something I'd expect from a 1950's housewife! To then suggest that she is separated from her baby is prime AH and I'm shocked you thought that was okay!", "YTA - Of course the baby cries every time you hold her... you are holding her wrong. I hope your little attempt at manipulating your son was worth the NC that I'm sure they will be enforcing on you. The fact that you think holding a baby is spoiling it or that a baby at weeks can manipulate and needs to cry it out makes me wonder how your son is the man he is.", "Is this a joke or are you really this clueless about babies or people in general? No mom wants to sit hearing their baby cry while someone else tells that NEWBORN that they won\u2019t get away with that. Get a grip!", "YTA  You are \\*never\\* entitled to see a baby without its mother.  I think the parents are doing the right thing limiting your relationship with your grandchild if this is your approach.", "YTA\n\nThe title is enough. She is their child first. That happens to make you her grandmother.\n\n>I told her the baby was going to get used to being held all the time if she kept doing that\n\nUnkind and rude.", "YTA\nI\u2019d suggest checking out the \u201cjust no mil\u201d subreddit to see :\n\nHow your DIL probably feels about you right now\n\nGet a glimpse of what the future may hold for you. \n\nIf you are willing to work on the relationship, next time you\u2019re there ask what you can do to help. Do they need groceries shopping, a home cooked meal, anything to take care of them ? And please don\u2019t offer to hold the baby while your DIL does chores \u2026\n\nKuddos to your son for calling your BS", "YTA. \n\nHow about this, you ask to visit your son and fiance, and you say that you know there is tension and you aren't exactly sure why but you want to mend things. You mention the tension started when you asked to be in the delivery room and then visited at the hospital, so if you overstepped or did something rude, you want to understand and apologize and build a relationship. \n\nThen, you listen to what they say. It's okay to ask to be in the delivery room, but did you really take her \"no\" in stride or did you say or do something at her response? Were you invited to show up at the hospital, or no? Find out their perspective and truly LISTEN. I'm not going to say you should apologize because we don't know their side, but even if it is just a misunderstanding, I would suggest being the \"bigger person\" and apologizing without any \"buts\" because fiance was the one going through a big life changing moment and so as someone a step removed, you can take on the brunt of whatever happened and truly apologize and ask for a fresh start.\n\nThen, you should certainly apologize for giving unsolicited advice about their child, and tell them you just want to be supportive and helpful.\n\nAnd then, you have to mean it. You seem totally in the dark about what you have done to create this hostility, and the longer it goes on- especially with you now wanting to separate a 6 week old from their mother- the worse it is going to get. So have an honest and kind conversation and remember it is better to be happy than to be right. Hear them out, apologize for your part, ask for clarity around things you don't understand, and move on in good faith.", "YTA.\n\nThis may come as a shock to you\u2026 but you are NOT that baby\u2019s mother. You have no right to override what the actual mother wants for her child. You may disagree with how she is parenting but\u2026 too bad. Not your child, not your decision.\n\nYou might want to read over your own post\u2026 the reasons your future daughter in law might not (doesn\u2019t) like or trust you are right there.\n\nI\u2019d highly suggest taking a long look at yourself and start changing your behavior and apologizing. Or you\u2019re going to find yourself cut off (rightly so) from your son and grandchild.", "YTA. It\u2019s abundantly clear to everyone reading this post what the issue here is. Even in the way you constructed your narrative to try and get Reddit on your side, you still come off badly. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re genuinely not understanding the issue or if you just truly don\u2019t care about your son\u2019s family\u2019s feelings, but either way you need to do some serious self reflection. \n\nAll the answers you need are right here in your post. Your son and his fianc\u00e9e don\u2019t like the way you interact with their baby and you ignore all their attempts at corrections or interventions. You believe you have the right to be present in the delivery room even through her own mother wasn\u2019t present. You have \u201cstopped in\u201d to visit five times before she even had her mom meet the baby and I\u2019m guessing you didn\u2019t exactly wait for an invitation those five times. You constantly give instructions on how you think they should care for the baby instead of listening to how they tell you they want to. And the worst of all, rather than attempt to have an actual conversation with them about how to solve these issues, your first idea is to cut out your grandchild\u2019s mother entirely and blame her 100%. \n\nThis is exactly the way the story goes when adult children cut off their parents. They\u2019ve given you multiple reasons and explanations for how your behavior is harmful to them and you remain firmly convinced that you are the only person who can be correct. If you carry on down this path you\u2019ll 100% lose the relationships you do have with your son\u2019s family. If you *actually* want relationships with them you need to listen to them, reflect on your own behavior, and stop being so stubborn.", "You are absolutely!  YTA to the max what the hell, lady?\n\nIt\u2019s not about you!  I don\u2019t blame dil for not trusting you.

Ask your son when is a good time to visit, and don't argue, compare, or be offended if his answer is less often than you'd like.\n\nWhen you do visit, don't opine on anything they do unless it is to praise, or there is imminent danger. Your job is to support them, not undermine them. If you offer help, it should be on things not focused on the baby (take this time to bond with the older son) and take no for an answer. If your DIL still seems hostile to you, let it roll off your back as much as possible, remembering that she is a new mother, and when you can't let it go any longer, speak to your son in a calm, private moment to ask if he notices the same and if so, whether there is anything you can do to help matters.\n\nBabies cry.

Most couples are aware of this and try to find some balance, but even with the best intentions, that bias is there. The mother is the primary parent for a very young child (usually), and she naturally turns more to her own parents. This is not something done to hurt the father's parents. It is just a fact of life. You will do best if you accept that you may likely be less favoured than the other grandmother, when the baby is a baby, and just be happy to be a secondary grandmother.

And most of us are very sensitive when it comes to WW2. There is a lot to unpack and reflect upon. And one of the topics that gets less attention is parenting. There was a famous German doctor named Johanna Haarer who wrote many books on parenting. And her work was and is popular in many countries. She cultivated the \"don't let babys manipulate you so they get their way with you\" \"let them cry they will get used to it and it will get less\". And why was that so beneficial? Because the army needed soldiers that were numb, hard and without empathy. Yeah older people don't like to hear that the parenting style was preferred for war but that's what it is. And now 2 generations later we have a lot of people going through therapy because their parents could never teach them how to cope with anxiety and negative emotions because they themself never learned to. And this younger generation is the first to be so open about therapy and not seeing it as \"weak\" or \"failure\".

Baby doesn't like the way she's being held.

Americans are a very individualist society, so lots of parenting advice from us focuses on forcing autonomy onto kids way too early.

To a hormonal new mother that would be like a red rag to a bull! I remember my MiL making a comment about how I was listening to a podcast while expressing when my daughter was three weeks old.

She clearly lost battles with the first one, I doubt she wanted MIL 1 at her first birth.\n\nI'm applauding OPs DIL for her strength and growth. She knows what she and her children need. Now we just have to hope her husband stands up against his shitty controlling mother and looks after his wife and kids.", "Exactly. I thought about this a lot, like you, because my MIL was trying to be nice and helpful, but I really felt she was invasive and not that supportive, and actually really critical, probably without meaning to be. I think what it is, is that the MIL maybe thinks of herself as a teacher, and the mother of the baby as needing to learn this \"skill\" of taking care of a baby. But in reality, every baby is different than every other baby. Some babies sleep well, some don't, some are calm, others are cranky. If you had a calm baby, then telling the mother of a cranky baby that \"you should do this, or this, or this other thing because I did it, and my baby was very calm\" is not actually helpful, it just makes the mother of the baby feel bad. Each mother has to learn what her OWN baby needs, and even each of her babies might need something different than other babies, so she has to learn each baby separately. \n\nAnd I think the other thing is the research showing that it is not good for babies if their mothers are depressed or stressed, because what the baby needs is a happy, healthy mom who can respond to the baby's unique needs with confidence. So criticizing the mother, unless it's life or death, actually makes it harder for the mother to parent correctly, not easier. Encouraging and complimenting the mother for what she's doing correctly, is more useful than criticizing what you think she's doing wrong, because it's going to communicate information but also lift her up. Obviously if the baby's mother is doing actively dangerous things, you have to speak up, or call CPS or whatever is appropriate, but hopefully that is very unlikely. Also, I think it's why, as you point out, offering to help with the least skilled work, is the most useful thing, because it frees the mother's attention for the aspects that need her unique attention. Or, provide support to the mother: make her a treat she likes, that sort of thing. \n\nIn recent years I think research has really started to recognize that supporting a mom to be a good parent is not so much about \"teaching\" her as if she were basically a computer with hands (that needs no sleep, of course), and more about the \"mother-baby dyad\", which really recognizes that it's the individual relationship between the mother and her baby that helps the baby thrive. So helping the mother thrive can actually help the baby thrive too.", "Did you catch that she \"stops in\"? It sounds like she's not invited and she's showing up without notice to a house with a *newborn*!!!", "I\u2019m of the same generation as OP, even I know it\u2019s an outdated practice.

She spoiled the crap out of her kids throughout their whole lives, basically offered to be an on-call, open daycare for any and all of her grandkids. Don't feel like dealing with the kids this weekend? Take then to grandma's. This spills over into her thinking she is the textbook of parenting so when my sister had her son recently (3 mos.), naturally aunt had to make the 10 hour trip to \"come see my grand-nephew.\" All the while she was visiting, constantly telling my sister what she was \"doing wrong\" or making suggestions because \"it's what always worked for my kids.\" It's worth pointing out we stopped attending extended family Christmas gatherings because aunt's grandkids would run around, screaming, punching, kicking, pulling hair (this is just the 9 year old). Aunt's kids (my cousins) behaved the same way when they were younger because aunt never disciplined them for anything and this carried through to their parenting with the grandkids never being disciplined either.
