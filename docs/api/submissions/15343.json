A lot of them tend to be older, tons were my dad's Legos when he was growing up, so I definitely want those ones.\n\nAt Easter, my sister got roped into the discussion with my wife & I and she agreed with my wife. While we both enjoyed the Legos a lot as kids, I would be an asshole if I took my Legos back from the classroom. They both suggested starting a new collection for our kids so they can love and enjoy those ones as they grow up. But I just don't agree.

Those were legos started by your dad so there is a sentimental value and that\u2019s something you want to share with your kids so it\u2019s only fair you take the legos back.", "NTA.  Your mom and your sneaky wife can buy replacement Lego on Craigslist for her students.  Or ask the students parent's to each contribute a bunch of Lego. Or both. \n\nThey were both dishonest.   They are your Lego, and you made clear you wanted to keep them, very clear.  Zero wrong with wanting to keep something that was yours as a child.  Take all the Lego back at the end of the year.  Inform your mom and wife now, so they can start looking for whatever replacements they need.", "Wow, YWNBTA. My son has about the same amount of Legos that you're describing, he's now 20 and in college. We are holding onto his Legos until he's ready to take them, indefinitely. I would never, ever presume to do anything but store them for him, they are his.\n\nYour mom is the AH here. She should have asked you if it was ok to take them to her classroom, she assumed and it is not ok. You have every right to take them back. Your idea of searching Craig's list is nice, Legos are SUPER expensive!", "NTA-take your Legos back at the end of the school year (you have sentimental attachment to them) and help your mom/wife/school buy some new ones for the classroom. Problem solved. Then, every year for a holiday or something (Christmas maybe?) buy some new ones to add to that classroom collection.\n\nYour mom unfortunately created this mess. She should have talked to you first. But this really isn\u2019t a giant problem, except cost. \n\nAlso, there are some grants through Lego to help fund classrooms. Help your mom apply for one for the school children.", "NTA - maybe buy some replacement Legos on craigslist for your mums classroom so the kids in the class still get to play with lego, but definitely take your own back.", "NAH. \n\nYou haven't checked on these much beloved heirlooms for **several years**. You've gone to college, got married, had kids and didn't even know where these Legos were. \n\nYou aren't an asshole to take them back at end of year (and I commend you for realizing you WOULD be an AH if you demanded them while kids were in school) but do the right thing and buy a class collection. Consider it payment for the YEARS of free storage and maintainence.\n\nDo not complain if any legos are missing. Do not complain about cost of replacement. The classroom probably doesn't care about THESE legos as much as you so you should be able to swap without concern.", "NAH- you have a wife and children why are you still storing your things at your parents house? If you wanted to keep them you shouldn't have left them there for 12 years and I don't blame you're mum for thinking you were never going to want them back. However, since you're willing to wait till the end of the year I think its reasonable to ask for them back, could you not get some second hand ones to give to the classroom instead and just swap? \n\nAlso kinda seems like maybe your wife just doesn't want a ton of lego in the house and is pushing for the school to keep them because of that. As a parent to two young children with a ton of lego I can't judge her for that. It's messy and painful and the kids fight over specific parts constantly. Still fun though!", "NAH.\n\nIn the twelve years since college, you had ample time to reclaim your Lego. It\u2019s reasonable that your teacher-mom put them to use in the interval.\n\nHowever, the kids are now used to having a Lego collection. Your wife and sister are right about that part.\n\nBut fortunately, there\u2019s a simple compromise. Buy Lego for the classroom (new or used, your call), give them to your mom with a thank you for storing yours for over a decade, and take your collection back.", "NTA. You have a sentimental attachment to those Legos and have offered to buy replacements- this is far more than good enough on your part. Your mom agreed to store them for you but never asked to use them for her students and it seems your wife gave permission on your behalf - they are the AHs.", "NAH. \nMy grandparents gave away my barbies to my younger cousins. I'm still mad about it especially as a lot of the stuff had come from pocket money so I do get why your upset.\n\nBut also I do see it from your mum's POV about there being a lot and trying to find a new life for it.", "NAH\nWhy no one consulted with you first?", "NAH.\n\nGiven that it's over a decade since you last saw them, I don't really think there's anything wrong with your mother finding a use for the legos. At the same time, they're yours, you never gave them away (and it sounds like you would have picked them up had your mom ever asked you to).\n\nSince you attach sentimental value to those in the classroom, I think you should take those back, but if you can afford it, buy some new ones to donate  to the class to replace the ones you take (trust me, I know how expensive that can be, so I'm not blaming you if you don't donate as many as you take). This works well for putting your own mind at ease (getting your stuff back) and takes care of the kids in the classroom who obviously know that legos are awesome.", "I think getting some craigslist Legos for the classroom would make sense so you can get your Legos back. Sounds like you already solved the problem, if your family will just give them back like they promised. \n\nNAH", "NTA and some people never understand the value you have for them. Why cannot the class get new legos off craiglist? It may mean not much to the kids who might not even notice the difference as opposed to you who dreamed of having the legos to pass down to your own. Go get it as what your mom did was a massive breach of trust.", "If this had happened during the time you were in college or shortly after, it'd be one thing. But 12 years later? NAH", "NAH- \n\n>I had 8 large storage totes of Legos when I left home for college\n\nThat is an absolute fuck ton of legos, just take the ones back that are specially sentimental to you.", "NAH. If it'd been less than 12 years, I might've thrown some heat on your mom for going against your wishes, but this wasn't just you at college, you've had plenty of time to reclaim them if they were importan. That being said, why not do what your wife has suggested and buy new legos from craigslist, and take them to the classroom so you can reclaim yours?", "NTA.\n\neveryone else is but you.\n\nYour mom and wife should have discussed with you beforehand taking the Lego to the classroom. Especially as you made it very clear that out of anything else, the Lego is what you wanted most from your childhood.\n\nI also have Lego from my childhood and having those memories attached to them means more than just random lego ever could (that you'd have to pay and arm and a leg to  get, even used)", "NAH - You had YEARS to reclaim your toys.  My husband's transformers were lovingly played with and broken by his nieces and nephews.  That's what happens when you don't take things.  Your son is 5, you should have anticipated getting Legos before now if you really cared.\n\nFine at the end of the year, but replace them.  They have been used for YEARS in the classroom and you never even knew.", "NAH. Buy some legos and swap them out with the ones in the classroom.", "I think your mom was wrong in not telling you or even asking if you were okay with it, but at the same time, could you not come to a compromise where you only take, say, half? Or take a tote per child, maybe go through them and pick out the ones you know were your dads or are particularly special to you? Otherwise, I have to agree with your wife, the best place for that amount of legos is where they will best be enjoyed. Your children will enjoy the legos whether they were handed down or brand new, children at that age can hardly tell the difference.", "NAH\n\nI read your comment about going to school in another state and not moving to the area until 2021. When you were done with school and home for a visit you could have shipped them to where you were living or ask your mom to do or get them when you moved back.\n\nYou didn't need them until now, so you let it be, out of sight out of mind. Your mom stored them for years.  You didn't do anything to get them until recently.\n\nYour mom should have asked before she brought them into the school or given you a timeframe to get them or she'd donate the Legos.\n\nWhy not ask your wife to photograph the ones that are special to the kids, leave those or some of those and add the replacement ones you get. Maybe they can make a big deal about the new arrivals.\n\nCheck out local buy nothing groups on Facebook. You can post an ISO Legos for Special Education class and people may respond.", "ESH, Everybody Sucks Here, but come on.\n\nYour mother should have given you a last chance to get your Lego totes before taking them to the classroom, that's true.  My bet is that you would have just insisted she continue acting as your free storage unit though.\n\nYou had 12 years to figure out whether these were important to you or not.  Once you left home for good, you essentially agreed that what you left behind was of less consequence.", "NTA, but you should both be aware that old Lego (pre 1970s) can be degraded & have lead, cadmium & other harmful stuff. Anything made since 1981 is ok according to Lego.  It's something in the colourants , so not all blocks are affected. \nNewer lego is easier to sanitize as you can just chuck it in a pillowcase in the washing machine on cool. (It's made of ABS).", "ESH- sorry dude. you waited 12 years to go get them, you had plenty of time to grab them and chose to leave them.  So special that you didn't even touch them or even see them for 12 years.\n\nI'd talk to your mom, see if SOME of the lego can go back with you, that way the kids would still have some in the classroom and you'd still have a some to give to your kids to add onto.\n\nI changed mine because, mom should have let you know about the lego in the classroom.", "ESH.  Your mom should have given you one last chance to claim them, but that chance should have been years ago.   You have a family of your own,  but expect mommy to hang onto your crap indefinitely?", "Teacher here, you would NTA. No chance. If their students need Lego, they can use the school budget to buy them.", "NTA. They are important to you. If you can, buy new lego for the school. The kid there will probably enjoy that even more.", "Nta, its your stuff. Altho, you left those things there for years, so idk what you expected to happen", "NTA.  It's always mind blowing to me when someone steals something and then has the gall to tell them they need to just get over it. Get your Legos back, the only reason your wife doesn't see it as a big deal is because it isn't something of hers.", "It\u2019s a tough call here. On the one hand, you have these legos that are rightfully your property and your mom doesn\u2019t seem to have asked you permission to take them to her classroom (after you expressly said you wanted them). Now you want them back, and are entitled to them, as they are yours. \n\nOn the other hand, you have special needs children that find change hard. Could you maybe replace some (if not all) for the classroom? You could take yours for your children, but the children in mom\u2019s class would still have *some* legos to play with. I don\u2019t think you should have to fully fund this, and you have no legal obligation to do so. But maybe you and mom can come up with a budget and then go about finding some as cheaply as you can (Craigslist, eBay, etc) to put in her classroom for those children. \n\nLike I say, you have no *legal* obligation to do this, but *morally*? IDK. Perhaps. \n\nIt sucks that mom did this without your express permission, as they weren\u2019t hers to do as she pleased. But it would also suck for those children to lose out because of it.\n\nEdit: typo", "Y T A - if you call them Legos you don\u2019t deserve them \n\nKidding \u2026 kidding \u2026 I\u2019m a Lego nerd\n\nNAH\nI can see why you want them back and why your mom thought it would be safe to use them after 12 years. A different take from someone who volunteered in schools for years: you may not want them back. Kids are gross and even worse with things that aren\u2019t theirs. I\u2019d leave them and get new ones.", "NTA, your legos, that you specifically stated were yours and you would like to keep them,  even offered to take them with you, were stolen from you.", "NTA. They are yours, your mom said she would keep them until you wanted them, she knew they were important to you and didn\u2019t ask you before she took them. The kids in the class can get cheap replacements, but your Legos are yours. They have sentimental value for you. If your mom didn\u2019t want the kids in her class to loose them, she shouldn\u2019t have given them to them without your consent or permission.", "NTA if i had my mom hold something that had some value from a family member and let someone use it i wiuld want it back too.  \n\nI would take em back and the end of the year and your mom could just tell them she bought new ones to the students.", "Ask wife and sis why mom can't buy new legos? The old ones are yours, the kits are probably discontinued, and you want them back.\n\nNTA", "So you are NTA.  \n Honestly. I\u2019d be throwing $100 at my mom so she can buy her own GD legos and getting mine back the minute I knew what happened to my personal heirlooms (and yes I\u2019d classify these at that level). I\u2019d be the epitome of the elmo in flames gif and so mad if my mom did this to my Barbie\u2019s and my little pony collection. \nYou thought they were safe, and she said she would store them. Had she said \u201ccome get these or I\u2019m bringing them for the crumb grabbers at school.\u201d You would have figured something out for storage, or could have been nice and let her bring them in. I\u2019m irritated on your behalf.", "NTA- My mom did something very similar to me while I was in college. She pressured me into saying yes \"you never use them anyway,\" and \"you're aunt was always under the presumption that we would give the table back.\" So the Legos that were purchased for me, were then given to my cousin for her students. I'll never forgive my mom for that as I had many set that are now deemed pretty valuable from a collector's standpoint. \n\nAnd what do you know, that 'aunt' had been nothing but rude to my family since my mom is now gone.\n\nNTA- I feel your pain. I'm never going to forgive my mom for getting rid of my Legos.", "NTA, some of those sets are classics that can never be replaced but the class some sets and get your old ones back", "My mother is a teacher.  I experienced the same thing.  I have a solution for you.  Go to the class.  Watch the kids playing with those Legos and absolutely loving it while they let their imaginations build all sorts of amazing and funny things.  For me it really helped because the child in my heart remembered all the fun I had with those Legos and it was Cathartic to see that after a few decades those same Legos were making dozens of kids happy.  I know they aren't cheap, but you and your kids will love picking out new sets and putting them together.  You're not an AH, you want to keep that kid inside of you alive.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I think the kids in your mother's class can help you do just that.  :)", "NTA\n\nYou specifically said you wanted them and your Mum didn\u2019t ask you if it was ok to take them to school. I understand it was a long time ago so asking would be reasonable but if you agree to keep something safe for someone you keep it safe.", "Absolute NTA. I would absolutely dgaf about the special ed kids. Thats a xour mom Problem and not a you Problem. She STOLE your Lego. \nEven if its 12 years. You had an agreement to store them. Period. \nShe should have asked first. So she will have to solve that Problem on her own.", "NTA. Your mother, wife and sister can buy LEGO if it's so important for those kids.", "NTA.

I kind of see why but at least replace them.\nYta.", "YTA if you wanted them so much you should have got them years ago instead of using your mom's as a free storage facility.

I'm probably going to be downvoted for this, but even though they are special needs children, that doesn't mean that they should be coddled to this extent. Especially if you're offering to replace them. They will not care that they aren't the same, because chances are extremely high that they aren't building the intended sets, but more so letting their imaginations and creativity run free.

There was an agreement between two parties, and the agreement could have changed at any point if the mom had *communicated* she wanted it to change. Not difficult. She put your legos, without asking, in a scenario where they would be *highly likely* to experience wear and tear, and go missing, and she did it without asking. Mom being a special ed teacher doesn\u2019t make her a saint, she\u2019s a person like the rest of us, capable of making bad choices. The fact is that she didn\u2019t have the right to use OPs stuff like this without his permission. Mom is also storing stuff for her other adult children, so the arguments that she forgot, or was overly burdened by storing the legos both feel wrong. Even if she couldn\u2019t remember which kid the legos belonged to, a quick group text would have resolved it. This is a open and shut case of the mom feeling entitled to something and didn\u2019t feel like asking about it. OPs wife literally lied to hide the fact that the legos were in use at the school, so it seems like she also knew it wasn\u2019t an entirely honest mistake, and she also felt an inappropriate disregard for her husband\u2019s boundaries.\n\nAlso, OPs wife and OPs sister can take a seat and stop getting involved. This situation has nothing to do with them (beyond the wife lying to cover it up), and they don\u2019t have a right to tell OP how to feel about his heirloom.\n\nOP, you\u2019ve already lost at least 15% of your original Lego set to wear and tear or kids pocketing their creations, so offering to get buy replacement legos for the classroom is already pretty generous. I get it, it\u2019s easier to keep the peace this way, but keep in mind that your mom used yours for free for years, and is solely responsible for whatever difficulty the kids have after having developed an attachment to the legos, because they never should have been there in the first place.

And the fact that your wife knew and clearly supported it makes me think she gave the initial approval. Maybe your mom discussed it with her and she said you were fine with it orso.

She took them without asking and gave them to her class to use. If he wants to complain about destruction of his property, he very well can.\n\nPersonally I don't care about Legos and can't relate to his attachment.

Additionally, if you had any that were sets, such as the pirate ship of about 40 years ago, that would be all but impossible to replace.\n2) Being handled over the years would mean that they all need to be cleaned. A lot.

Sounds like she raised a pretty cool kid so you might not have any problems.\n4) Your mother had the use of these, technically for free, unless she paid for them in the first place. It\u2019s nice to think that they were used and enjoyed for so many years but since she is a teacher, maybe the school can foot the bill and if, as usual, they have no funds for such things, there could be something like a fundraiser to build her collection back up. Nobody would likely do that for you.\n5) The special-ed kids are the responsibility of your mother and not you; it speaks well for you that you are concerned about how it would be for them if they came back and found no Legos there.

Sure your wife and your mom took things that were yours but if these kids are the ones that will get punished when you take them away. \n\nNow of course, if you take the original legos from the classroom and get them replaced with new sets you are in the clear. But only if you are switching them out on the same trip. Things happen and if you don\u2019t replace them right away that isn\u2019t fair to the kids. Calmly tell your mom why you are upset, and tell your wife it wasn\u2019t fair for her to keep the information from you since these toys were in the classroom where she works but that\u2019s about the extent of what you can do. \n\nIf you are storing anything else with your mother, make it clear you are picking those things up. But I would temper my expectation if I were you. I kept some things at my parents house when I went to college and when I picked them up 3 years after graduation they were dusty, boxes were crushed and my kid sister had picked thru everything and help herself to whatever she wanted.", "YTA. It was 12 years. You don't get to cry over Legos that you hadn't even thought of in a decade.", "Yeah mom is TA in this case (if someone has to be). Zero communication. Wife too for that matter, i'm guessing the mother discussed this with wife. Wife said 'idf want them'.\n\nBy this same logic someone can give away anything you own and you're made to be TA for eventually wanting it back.\n\n\nCraigslist legos is a fair compromise.", "NTA to avoid conflict id just buy some buckets of new legos and take those to the class and bring yours home. like, they still make legos lol its not like the kids would be deprived of them", ">They are your Lego, and you made clear you wanted to keep them, very clear.\n\nI would say leaving something at someone elses house for 12 years is not sending a clear signal that you still want them.", "I\u2019m 21 and I still have my Legos, majority of it was passed down to me when other relatives outgrew it, but it still has sentimental value for me.

Legos are a huge investment. \n\nMy DH was into MtG and when we had to give up a bunch during a move I mourned along with him.", "I'll be honest, I understand OP's frustration and he is NTA but that sounds like an insane amount of Legos to have around the house.

His mother knew this and going by the wife's responses, she knew it as well. It was a few totes full which is several thousand dollars. Literally every parent I know still has stuff at their house that their kids once loved that remain there until the conversation takes place of moving them.

He should not have them and not give them to his kids because yours didn't touch your husband's?

They\u2019ve been at her house unused for years.

At the time i had no space so i asked my parents to keep them in their attic, but once i had storage space, i took MY belongings to my house.

Also if my mom took some barbies to her class of special needs kids, i would once again be an adult, and say \u201cok i will buy your class some new ones\u201d (if there was sentimental value), or just let the kids have the toys and buy my kids some new ones.

Why don't tell it to the son first????", "As a special education teacher, I am sure that was her thought. Remember that schools don't pay for materials. This was a goldmine, and she had brought joy and countless hours of learning with these materials. Maybe a better idea is to swap them out slowly over the summer so kids don't notice as easily. \n\nOn the flip side, I kept all of my son's Legos for this very reason. I knew he would want them. Except for the Duplo blocks. Those went to day care right away.", "It took one three minute phone call for my mom to tell me that storing my rocks and Breyer horses and elementary school pictures was becoming an issue, and for us to work out a solution together.\n\nIt is totally incomprehensible to me that OPs mom took his deliberately stored items without asking once.  And his wife went along with it.  Especially Eight Totes worth of legos.", "https://www.retrojunk.com/a/4J9TBl-fTB/muscle-men\n   \nI googled it", "Either way, new Legos will need to be bought.  Either new sets of Legos are bought for OP's kid, or new Legos are bought for the class so OP can take the old Legos home. \n\nI'd say, since OP has a sentimental attachment, OP should take the old Legos from the class and buy new sets for his mom's class when they return from the summer.

My cousin and I had legos we played with together as kids in 1960s Germany. Her Mom kept them in the cellar when we outgrew them. Cousin had two boys; I moved to Canada. Needless to say, she kept the legos - on the mutual understanding that if I ever had kids, I'd get them. Well, I had one very late, and then we moved to Europe for a job. The legos (augmented considerably by new additions) arrived in our new city within weeks. By the time my daughter outgrew them, we were back in Canada - then cousin's oldest son had kids.

But now that he knows he should actually talk to his mom and figure out what he compromise then can come to. OP graduated like 8 years ago and apparently never again mentioned the Legos to mom, she probably assumed he didn't want them anymore", "My boys are 21 and 24 and my girls are 30, 32 and 33, we still have toys, books etc of theirs. We have been cleaning out our house of stuff and still asked each of them what they wanted to keep. We will store it for them as long as they want/need us to. That is all OPs mom had to do, ask him before taking them.", "Cost. 8 bins of Legos is thousands of dollars. I'd be furious if mine ended up in a classroom I wasn't in. Kids break and mistreat public property all the time. And kis in special ed rooms are more prone to it than others. I bring a lot of personal property(board games, video games, basketballs, Frisbee golf disc's, etc...) with me to work, working with those kids in other settings, but if a kid isn't respectful the plans change. We go to the Y or hike or draw or something else. I doubt Mom's taking that kind of care(and teachers have a much harder time building positive relationships/rapport because the kind of one on one time I get isn't something they can manage, so they're more likely to have a disregulated kid break their things specifically to hurt or anger them).", "Any parent who knew how important something was to their child and cared about their child would keep it if they had room/were able to. All she had to do was ask OP if they were still wanted. Source I have personally stored stuff for 5 children ranging in age from 21 to 33, I still ask them if I can get rid of THEIR belongings", "You\u2019re probably right, but that\u2019s a call for OP to make.  I look at it the same way I would look at antique car that had been left to rust, or a piece of furniture that\u2019s been in storage.  Yes, it\u2019s been beaten to death of time.  But if there\u2019s sentimental value in it for OP, then it\u2019s OP\u2019s call on whether to take them, not on someone else to pass judgement.  Repairs can be made, sets can be rebuilt.  Op\u2019s sets may be damaged or missing pieces, but a replacement will NEVER be Op\u2019s Lego.  It\u2019s ultimately up to OP to decide their worth.  \n\nAnd from a personal note, I had a lot of Lego growing up.  I built the sets.  Then I broke them down and chucked them in a box.   If someone massacred that box, as my son has no doubt already done, as I had definitely done when I was a kid, I\u2019d never be able to make those original sets again.  But that doesn\u2019t mean individual pieces of that collection don\u2019t hold value and nostalgia to me.  I remember using the pirate ship bow to make space ships.  I remember astronauts with swords.  Lego isn\u2019t always about having a 100% original set, the individual pieces have meaning even if some of the others are lost.  I didn\u2019t chuck my fathers compass out because the case was lost, and my grandfathers cold chisel isn\u2019t less sentimental to me because it used to be part of a set.  There\u2019s no reason to assume a Lego collection would lose all sentimental value because you can\u2019t rebuild the exact pirate ship from your childhood with 100% original pieces.", "My son is 22.

I got a new place and needed it back, sucked but my mom kept it in storage for 2 years and though I didn\u2019t need it.

She even asked me when I would like them back and even stated whenever I was ready to take them it\u2019s okay. That is until she decided to move out of her house then she notified me.
