Those were legos started by your dad so there is a sentimental value and that\u2019s something you want to share with your kids so it\u2019s only fair you take the legos back.", "NTA.  Your mom and your sneaky wife can buy replacement Lego on Craigslist for her students.  Or ask the students parent's to each contribute a bunch of Lego. Or both. \n\nThey were both dishonest.   They are your Lego, and you made clear you wanted to keep them, very clear.  Zero wrong with wanting to keep something that was yours as a child.  Take all the Lego back at the end of the year.  Inform your mom and wife now, so they can start looking for whatever replacements they need.", "Wow, YWNBTA. My son has about the same amount of Legos that you're describing, he's now 20 and in college. We are holding onto his Legos until he's ready to take them, indefinitely. I would never, ever presume to do anything but store them for him, they are his.\n\nYour mom is the AH here. She should have asked you if it was ok to take them to her classroom, she assumed and it is not ok. You have every right to take them back. Your idea of searching Craig's list is nice, Legos are SUPER expensive!", "NTA-take your Legos back at the end of the school year (you have sentimental attachment to them) and help your mom/wife/school buy some new ones for the classroom. Problem solved. Then, every year for a holiday or something (Christmas maybe?) buy some new ones to add to that classroom collection.\n\nYour mom unfortunately created this mess. She should have talked to you first. But this really isn\u2019t a giant problem, except cost. \n\nAlso, there are some grants through Lego to help fund classrooms. Help your mom apply for one for the school children.", "NTA - maybe buy some replacement Legos on craigslist for your mums classroom so the kids in the class still get to play with lego, but definitely take your own back.", "NAH. \n\nYou haven't checked on these much beloved heirlooms for **several years**. You've gone to college, got married, had kids and didn't even know where these Legos were. \n\nYou aren't an asshole to take them back at end of year (and I commend you for realizing you WOULD be an AH if you demanded them while kids were in school) but do the right thing and buy a class collection. Consider it payment for the YEARS of free storage and maintainence.\n\nDo not complain if any legos are missing. Do not complain about cost of replacement. The classroom probably doesn't care about THESE legos as much as you so you should be able to swap without concern.", "NAH- you have a wife and children why are you still storing your things at your parents house? If you wanted to keep them you shouldn't have left them there for 12 years and I don't blame you're mum for thinking you were never going to want them back. However, since you're willing to wait till the end of the year I think its reasonable to ask for them back, could you not get some second hand ones to give to the classroom instead and just swap? \n\nAlso kinda seems like maybe your wife just doesn't want a ton of lego in the house and is pushing for the school to keep them because of that. As a parent to two young children with a ton of lego I can't judge her for that. It's messy and painful and the kids fight over specific parts constantly. Still fun though!", "NAH.\n\nIn the twelve years since college, you had ample time to reclaim your Lego. It\u2019s reasonable that your teacher-mom put them to use in the interval.\n\nHowever, the kids are now used to having a Lego collection. Your wife and sister are right about that part.\n\nBut fortunately, there\u2019s a simple compromise. Buy Lego for the classroom (new or used, your call), give them to your mom with a thank you for storing yours for over a decade, and take your collection back.", "NTA. You have a sentimental attachment to those Legos and have offered to buy replacements- this is far more than good enough on your part. Your mom agreed to store them for you but never asked to use them for her students and it seems your wife gave permission on your behalf - they are the AHs.", "NAH. \nMy grandparents gave away my barbies to my younger cousins. I'm still mad about it especially as a lot of the stuff had come from pocket money so I do get why your upset.\n\nBut also I do see it from your mum's POV about there being a lot and trying to find a new life for it.", "NAH\nWhy no one consulted with you first?", "NAH.\n\nGiven that it's over a decade since you last saw them, I don't really think there's anything wrong with your mother finding a use for the legos. At the same time, they're yours, you never gave them away (and it sounds like you would have picked them up had your mom ever asked you to).\n\nSince you attach sentimental value to those in the classroom, I think you should take those back, but if you can afford it, buy some new ones to donate  to the class to replace the ones you take (trust me, I know how expensive that can be, so I'm not blaming you if you don't donate as many as you take). This works well for putting your own mind at ease (getting your stuff back) and takes care of the kids in the classroom who obviously know that legos are awesome.", "I think getting some craigslist Legos for the classroom would make sense so you can get your Legos back. Sounds like you already solved the problem, if your family will just give them back like they promised. \n\nNAH", "NTA and some people never understand the value you have for them. Why cannot the class get new legos off craiglist? It may mean not much to the kids who might not even notice the difference as opposed to you who dreamed of having the legos to pass down to your own. Go get it as what your mom did was a massive breach of trust.", "If this had happened during the time you were in college or shortly after, it'd be one thing. But 12 years later? NAH", "NAH- \n\n>I had 8 large storage totes of Legos when I left home for college\n\nThat is an absolute fuck ton of legos, just take the ones back that are specially sentimental to you.", "NAH. If it'd been less than 12 years, I might've thrown some heat on your mom for going against your wishes, but this wasn't just you at college, you've had plenty of time to reclaim them if they were importan. That being said, why not do what your wife has suggested and buy new legos from craigslist, and take them to the classroom so you can reclaim yours?", "NTA.\n\neveryone else is but you.\n\nYour mom and wife should have discussed with you beforehand taking the Lego to the classroom. Especially as you mad it very clear that out of anything else the Lego is what you wanted most from your childhood.\n\nI also have Lego from my childhood and having those memories attached to them means more than just random lego ever could (that you'd have to pay and arm and a leg to  get, even used)", "NAH - You had YEARS to reclaim your toys.  My husband's transformers were lovingly played with and broken by his nieces and nephews.  That's what happens when you don't take things.  Your son is 5, you should have anticipated getting Legos before now if you really cared.\n\nFine at the end of the year, but replace them.  They have been used for YEARS in the classroom and you never even knew.", "NAH. Buy some legos and swap them out with the ones in the classroom.", "I think your mom was wrong in not telling you or even asking if you were okay with it, but at the same time, could you not come to a compromise where you only take, say, half? Or take a tote per child, maybe go through them and pick out the ones you know were your dads or are particularly special to you? Otherwise, I have to agree with your wife, the best place for that amount of legos is where they will best be enjoyed. Your children will enjoy the legos whether they were handed down or brand new, children at that age can hardly tell the difference.", "NAH\n\nI read your comment about going to school in another state and not moving to the area until 2021. When you were done with school and home for a visit you could have shipped them to where you were living or ask your mom to do or get them when you moved back.\n\nYou didn't need them until now, so you let it be, out of sight out of mind. Your mom stored them for years.  You didn't do anything to get them until recently.\n\nYour mom should have asked before she brought them into the school or given you a timeframe to get them or she'd donate the Legos.\n\nWhy not ask your wife to photograph the ones that are special to the kids, leave those or some of those and add the replacement ones you get. Maybe they can make a big deal about the new arrivals.\n\nCheck out local buy nothing groups on Facebook. You can post an ISO Legos for Special Education class and people may respond.", "ESH, but come on.\n\nYour mother should have given you a last chance to get your Lego totes before taking them to the classroom, that's true.  My bet is that you would have just insisted she continue acting as your free storage unit though.\n\nYou had 12 years to figure out whether these were important to you or not.  Once you left home for good, you essentially agreed that what you left behind was of less consequence.", "NTA, but you should both be aware that old Lego (pre 1970s) can be degraded & have lead, cadmium & other harmful stuff. Anything made since 1981 is ok according to Lego.  It's something in the colourants , so not all blocks are affected. \nNewer lego is easier to sanitize as you can just chuck it in a pillowcase in the washing machine on cool. (It's made of ABS).", "ESH- sorry dude. you waited 12 years to go get them, you had plenty of time to grab them and chose to leave them.  So special that you didn't even touch them or even see them for 12 years.\n\nI'd talk to your mom, see if SOME of the lego can go back with you, that way the kids would still have some in the classroom and you'd still have a some to give to your kids to add onto.\n\nI changed mine because, mom should have let you know about the lego in the classroom.", "ESH.  Your mom should have given you one last chance to claim them, but that chance should have been years ago.   You have a family of your own,  but expect mommy to hang onto your crap indefinitely?", "Teacher here, you would NTA. No chance. If their students need Lego, they can use the school budget to buy them.", "NTA. They are important to you. If you can, buy new lego for the school. The kid there will probably enjoy that even more.", "Nta, its your stuff. Altho, you left those things there for years, so idk what you expected to happen", "NTA.  It's always mind blowing to me when someone steals something and then has the gall to tell them they need to just get over it. Get your Legos back, the only reason your wife doesn't see it as a big deal is because it isn't something of hers.", "It\u2019s a tough call here. On the one hand, you have these legos that are rightfully your property and your mom doesn\u2019t seem to have asked you permission to take them to her classroom (after you expressly said you wanted them). Now you want them back, and are entitled to them, as they are yours. \n\nOn the other hand, you have special needs children that find change hard. Could you maybe replace some (if not all) for the classroom? You could take yours for your children, but the children in mom\u2019s class would still have *some* legos to play with. I don\u2019t think you should have to fully fund this, and you have no legal obligation to do so. But maybe you and mom can come up with a budget and then go about finding some as cheaply as you can (Craigslist, eBay, etc) to put in her classroom for those children. \n\nLike I say, you have no *legal* obligation to do this, but *morally*? IDK. Perhaps. \n\nIt sucks that mom did this without your express permission, as they weren\u2019t hers to do as she pleased. But it would also suck for those children to lose out because of it.\n\nEdit: typo", "Y T A - if you call them Legos you don\u2019t deserve them \n\nKidding \u2026 kidding \u2026 I\u2019m a Lego nerd\n\nNAH\nI can see why you want them back and why your mom thought it would be safe to use them after 12 years. A different take from someone who volunteered in schools for years: you may not want them back. Kids are gross and even worse with things that aren\u2019t theirs. I\u2019d leave them and get new ones.", "NTA, your legos, that you specifically stated were yours and you would like to keep them,  even offered to take them with you, were stolen from you.", "NTA. They are yours, your mom said she would keep them until you wanted them, she knew they were important to you and didn\u2019t ask you before she took them. The kids in the class can get cheap replacements, but your Legos are yours. They have sentimental value for you. If your mom didn\u2019t want the kids in her class to loose them, she shouldn\u2019t have given them to them without your consent or permission.", "NTA if i had my mom hold something that had some value from a family member and let someone use it i wiuld want it back too.  \n\nI would take em back and the end of the year and your mom could just tell them she bought new ones to the students.", "Ask wife and sis why mom can't buy new legos? The old ones are yours, the kits are probably discontinued, and you want them back.\n\nNTA", "So you are NTA.  \n Honestly. I\u2019d be throwing $100 at my mom so she can buy her own GD legos and getting mine back the minute I knew what happened to my personal heirlooms (and yes I\u2019d classify these at that level). I\u2019d be the epitome of the elmo in flames gif and so mad if my mom did this to my Barbie\u2019s and my little pony collection. \nYou thought they were safe, and she said she would store them. Had she said \u201ccome get these or I\u2019m bringing them for the crumb grabbers at school.\u201d You would have figured something out for storage, or could have been nice and let her bring them in. I\u2019m irritated on your behalf.", "NTA- My mom did something very similar to me while I was in college. She pressured me into saying yes \"you never use them anyway,\" and \"you're aunt was always under the presumption that we would give the table back.\" So the Legos that were purchased for me, were then given to my cousin for her students. I'll never forgive my mom for that as I had many set that are now deemed pretty valuable from a collector's standpoint. \n\nAnd what do you know, that 'aunt' had been nothing but rude to my family since my mom is now gone.\n\nNTA- I feel your pain. I'm never going to forgive my mom for getting rid of my Legos.", "NTA, some of those sets are classics that can never be replaced but the class some sets and get your old ones back", "My mother is a teacher.  I experienced the same thing.  I have a solution for you.  Go to the class.  Watch the kids playing with those Legos and absolutely loving it while they let their imaginations build all sorts of amazing and funny things.  For me it really helped because the child in my heart remembered all the fun I had with those Legos and it was Cathartic to see that after a few decades those same Legos were making dozens of kids happy.  I know they aren't cheap, but you and your kids will love picking out new sets and putting them together.  You're not an AH, you want to keep that kid inside of you alive.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I think the kids in your mother's class can help you do just that.  :)", "NTA\n\nYou specifically said you wanted them and your Mum didn\u2019t ask you if it was ok to take them to school. I understand it was a long time ago so asking would be reasonable but if you agree to keep something safe for someone you keep it safe.", "Absolute NTA. I would absolutely dgaf about the special ed kids. Thats a xour mom Problem and not a you Problem. She STOLE your Lego. \nEven if its 12 years. You had an agreement to store them. Period. \nShe should have asked first. So she will have to solve that Problem on her own.", "NTA. Your mother, wife and sister can buy LEGO if it's so important for those kids.", "NTA. Ask for them back, or its theft.", "NTA\n\nPlease do buy the kids some replacements at the end of the year.", "Come on. 12 years????? I kind of see why but at least replace them.\nYta.", "YTA if you wanted them so much you should have got them years ago instead of using your mom's as a free storage facility.

I'm probably going to be downvoted for this, but even though they are special needs children, that doesn't mean that they should be coddled to this extent. Especially if you're offering to replace them. They will not care that they aren't the same, because chances are extremely high that they aren't building the intended sets, but more so letting their imaginations and creativity run free.

You made it clear you wanted to keep the Legos, and they have an emotional attachment to you. \n\n> They both suggested starting a new collection for our kids so they can love and enjoy those ones as they grow up. \n\nOr... you can take your Legos and the group of you can chip in to buy used ones for the classroom. Why on earth is it important for the classroom to have _your_ Legos?", "NTA - my mom is also a special education teacher and she has always asked me if my old things can be used for her classroom and makes sure I know that they\u2019re mine and if I ever want them (for my own kids one day) that they are absolutely mine to have back. I get that the kids love the Lego\u2019s, but you have made it known for a long time you want those back. If your mom wants legos for her classroom she can buy some herself or honestly it would be nice if you to help her purchase some. You had one request of something for her to keep safe for you for your kids and she didn\u2019t hold up her end of the deal.", "NTA\n\nYou can certainly take the Legos back at the end of the school year.  Then look for some at yard sales to put in the classroom for the new school year. \n\nMom knew you wanted the Legos, she shouldn't have put them in her classroom.", "Nta. Lego is incredibly expensive and as such she should have asked you. It\u2019s yours.  My own kids took care of their so much that my youngest sold his for a decent amount of money. That was his choice.", "NTA not only is it Your property, it\u2019s an heirloom from your dad.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that many of the vintage Lego sets are worth Money, yes Capital M.", "NTA, but get your legos back sooner than later. The longer you wait, the higher the chance something happens to them.", "NTA. Your mom is welcome to get more off Craigslist herself if she thinks they're essential to the classroom, and these ones have very sentimental value to you, especially those that were your dads. If you wanted to be extra nice you could even spring for a set or two off Craigslist and trade them, but I don't think that's even necessary.", "NTA. i know how you feel. my mother took every toy and childhood possession of mine and gave them to my little sister. including my baby stuffy. it sucks and i\u2019m sorry this happened to you.", "NTA they weren't your mom's Legos to donate to the classroom. If there are issues around you reclaiming them they are on her.", "I hate seeing posts like this. The person that gets wronged always is being told to be there bigger person and to let things go. If it was a bunch of care bears and porcelain dolls your sister was trying to get back, I fully believe everyone would be singing a different tune. Your feelings matter and your wants are important. Your wife, sister and mum aren't taking your feelings into consideration at all. It's your stuff.....handed down from your dad. Why does she get to steal them ?", "NTA. Your mother agreed to store them until you could take them. They were not hers to give away. Tell her you want your sets back because they are sentimental for you.  \nPick up a few sets off craigslist or at thrift shops before you pick yours up and donate those to the classroom and the kids. Everyone gets what they want.", "NTA, get those Legos back. Have your mother go on Facebook Market place or maybe ebay and buy some for the classroom. She should have spoke to you first before taking something she knew you wanted and you made a loud and clear statement that those were yours. And your wife should have spoke up years ago and told you then what your mother had done. Shame on both those women for not being honest all that time ago.", "NTA but goddamn that is a ton of legos. Could you take back 4 bins and leave 4 with your mom's class? You're definitely in the right to take all of them but if you want to be the bigger person that might be a solution.", "NTA and go get your Legos.  Please know that if they had been in the classroom for any length of time, there is a pretty good possibility that many of your original set may have gone missing by now.  Either way, collect what is yours and your mom and wife can buy their children a new set.  This was mean of both mom and wife to take them from you without your knowledge.", "OK, first of all.. You are NTA. They're yours and she took them without asking. You have every right to ask for them back.\n\nThat being said, 8 large totes is ALOT of legos. Can't you split them, and leave some for the classroom and take some for your kids?", "NTA. My mom also took my things without permission to her classroom. So not cool.", "NTA. The Legos obviously means something to you and you want to share it with your kids. Totally understandable.", "My family's private things aren't utilized at my job. So, NTA.", "NTA. \n\nEveryone piling on you about the timing of reclaiming *your* heirloom is surprising to me, because the timing is irrelevant. There was an agreement between two parties, and the agreement could have changed at any point if the mom had *communicated* she wanted it to change. Not difficult. She put your legos, without asking, in a scenario where they would be *highly likely* to experience wear and tear, and go missing, and she did it without asking. Mom being a special ed teacher doesn\u2019t make her a saint, she\u2019s a person like the rest of us, capable of making bad choices. The fact is that she didn\u2019t have the right to use OPs stuff like this without his permission. Mom is also storing stuff for her other adult children, so the arguments that she forgot, or was overly burdened by storing the legos both feel wrong. Even if she couldn\u2019t remember which kid the legos belonged to, a quick group text would have resolved it. This is a open and shut case of the mom feeling entitled to something and didn\u2019t feel like asking about it. OPs wife literally lied to hide the fact that the legos were in use at the school, so it seems like she also knew it wasn\u2019t an entirely honest mistake, and she also felt an inappropriate disregard for her husband\u2019s boundaries.\n\nAlso, OPs wife and OPs sister can take a seat and stop getting involved. This situation has nothing to do with them (beyond the wife lying to cover it up), and they don\u2019t have a right to tell OP how to feel about his heirloom.\n\nOP, you\u2019ve already lost at least 15% of your original Lego set to wear and tear or kids pocketing their creations, so offering to get buy replacement legos for the classroom is already pretty generous. I get it, it\u2019s easier to keep the peace this way, but keep in mind that your mom used yours for free for years, and is solely responsible for whatever difficulty the kids have after having developed an attachment to the legos, because they never should have been there in the first place. Your family piling on you like you\u2019re the one being the AH sucks.", "NTA I guess since they're yours.... but doing that will give you problems in the long run with your mother and since your wife is her assistant, the problems will be on/to her... too. \n\nThe sentimental value of the legos are inside you. You can get new ones and hand them over to your children saying they were handed over to you by your dad... yes, it'd be technically a lie but... I don't see anyone getting hurt with it... \n\nIn case you go and get them, you're in your right... since they're yours... but prepare yourself because your mother \\*WILL\\* be angry, I guess.   \nHopefully not...", "Umm, why didn't you get them after college?  Why 12ish years later?  YTA for expecting someone to just store things until you decide you want them.", "NTA, they were not your mom's to give away. And the fact that your wife knew and clearly supported it makes me think she gave the initial approval. Maybe your mom discussed it with her and she said you were fine with it orso. It's YOUR lego, and it clearly has sentimental value. I'm surprised at how you can talk about it being in a classroom so calmly, I would be furious. They are just guilttripping you into not taking it from children, while they (the adults) stole it from you.", "It doesn\u2019t matter what your wife or your sister\u2019s opinions are. Your belongings are yours to do with as you please. Your Mom can buy others if she must have them in her classroom.

They were passed down from your dad and they\u2019re sentimental.\n\nYou asked your mum to keep them and didn\u2019t give her permission to give it away. \n\nI\u2019d be a bit mad that she did that. And annoyed at my wife and sister for telling me I\u2019m an asshole. \n\nYou wife, mum and sister can buy the kids new Lego\u2019s to plan with.", "NTA. It really sucks that your wife and your mom are conspiring to lie to you and steal your shit. Marriage counseling might not be the worst idea.", "NTA", "This. I graduated high school before 2000, and my parents just called to ask if I wanted them to mail me my cap and gown.", "This.\n\nBoth your mom and wife knew how much they mean to you. They are AH, not you.", "As long as I have worked in schools, I don't think its OK that everyone in my household has to support my job with their personal property. And sometimes I can't afford to just purchase things that enhance the learning environment. Oh, well. That's the school board's responsibility - not my family's.", "Exactly! I can't imagine doing something like that to my kid's stuff if they specifically told me they wanted it. If I needed the space I'd talk to them about it, but to just take it without even talking to him first is awful. And the fact that his wife knew about it and never said anything is pretty messed up too.", "And what about the special pieces that kids would have taken home in their pockets/backpacks, or did mom make sure that no pilfering ever occurred?", ">Your mom unfortunately created this mess. \n\nDid she, though?  I'm thinking it was the wife.  She's the one who wants OP to \"let it go\".", "Consider it payment for the years of free storage and maintenance? The sets are probably damaged and missing pieces from being used on the classroom and he has every right to be annoyed or disappointed, especially since they have sentimental value to him. He offered to take them with him if the storage would be a hassle or inconvenience, he shouldn't have to check up on them continuously to prove he cares about them. \n\nMom is an AH for bringing them to the classroom without ever asking. If she didn't want them in the house, she should have taken him up on his offer to take them with him. Plus, his wife knew, and lied about what had happened to the Legos. That makes her an AH too.", "Yeah, be sure you wash them well, OP.", "I came here to say the same thing. It\u2019s been 12 years\u2026 time to move on.", "Why would he be checking on Legos that were supposed to be safely stored? He had already offered to store them himself and his mom said it was unnecessary. If something happened to them, it was on her to tell him something was wrong. But something didn't happen to them. She took them without asking and gave them to her class to use. If he wants to complain about destruction of his property, he very well can.\n\nPersonally I don't care about Legos and can't relate to his attachment. However, I think it really just boils down to a matter of respect. If something doesn't belong to you, ask before you take it. So I think there is an AH in this situation. But it's not OP. Especially since he said he's willing to replace the Legos, which he shouldn't have to do in the first place.", "Pretty sure mom agreed to store the Legos. Normal protocol should be to notify the owner of any plans that are counter to the original agreement. Time in storage is irrelevant unless dictated in the agreement.", "Does property ownership have a statute of limitations?", "Mom literally offered to store them and then stole them.", "I TRIED to get my mom to throw out my GI Joes but she always insisted on keeping them just in case I ever had kids. Now I\u2019m so glad she did.", "In my family\u2019s case, oldest sibling took younger sister\u2019s favorite books that she was saving for her future children and gave them to her own kids.  Our dad got mad at middle sibling for being upset.", "Personally, I'm not a keeper of things. I don't put sentimental value on objects and I don't like having stuff sitting around that's not useful anymore. I have negative interest for my childhood toys. But my solution would have been to send them off to college with the kid, not give them away without permission, especially when the kid has made it known they highly value those items.", "I took a lot of Lego to my classroom, but I asked my kids first and only took what they wanted. To be honest my grandkids have wanted the newer Lego, for the most part. However, they enjoyed several of my son's and daughter's sets.\n\nWhen I retired, I brought all my Lego home. Middle School kids don't generally get play time where I (and DIL) teach. Not sure why they would need so many. \n\nOP is definitely NTA, but mom who said she would store is.", "My guess is that somewhere in the decade between OP moving out and OP wanting the Legos, his mom assumed he didn't care about them anymore, particularly since his wife *knew* when the Legos were first brought to the classroom and knew where they had come from.", "My ILs threw away all of my husband\u2019s childhood toys. He has a few matchbox cars left. He\u2019s very, very bitter about it. Neither of us know why they did it, but they generally seem to live a disposable lifestyle, so they probably didn\u2019t give a second thought to someone else putting heirloom value in something.  \n\nMeanwhile I have a bunch of things that were my mom\u2019s and grandmother\u2019s when they were little. Different family philosophies.", "I also don't understand why everyone saying \"just buy more off of craigslist\" can't chip in to buy more for the classroom so OP can get his back.

They all ask before.\n\nHowever,  if someone left stuff at your place and said they'd come back for it - and it's still there a decade later, and they haven't even asked for it... not so much an asshole move to use the stuff at that point. \n\nI see both sides. We expect our parents to have bottomless basements so we don't have to store the stuff we don't really want but can't get rid of.", "This right here. This to me reads like OP's wife didn't want them around and so told the mom it was fine to take them, and was banking on OP forgetting about them after so many years. Now that the plan has blown up, she's relying on social pressure to keep him from getting his shit back. \n\nOP, at the end of the year take your Legos back and lose absolutely no sleep over it. Will the kids be disappointed? Maybe. But that disappointment is a direct result of your wife and mother ignoring your very clear, very simple request and doing whatever they wanted anyway without thinking about how it would make you feel. If they feel like the kids should have Legos to play with, maybe they should go buy them some and not give away yours which have sentimental value. NTA, but your wife are mother are.", "I'm thinking the same thing.", "My dude, these are legos that were bulk stored in bins not sets neatly packed away.

We have hundreds of Lego pieces.

They're almost certainly discontinued sets.", "I totally thought this too! But my comment was long enough so I left it out. Thx for mentioning it!", "Ask first before taking other people\u2019s stuff. It\u2019s not hard", "Until they give reasonable notice and opportunity for the items to be removed.", ">But my wife thinks that the kids will be quite upset as they are attached to \"some of the pieces in your collection\"\n\nThis confuses me.  Surely next year there will be a different crop of kids in that class room so what the current kids \"are attached to\" is irrelevant, unless your Mom has been letting them take them home.\n\nOverall, it seems to me your wife is the problem.  *She* doesn't want the Legos in your home, and *she* is the one trying to prevent you from retrieving them.\n\nNTA, OP.  Not at all.", "I think it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to replace them, and a kind gesture. \n\nI realize that you are upset by her decision to use the legos without asking you. I also understand her thought process - that since you weren\u2019t using them for years and they were just being stored, you wouldn\u2019t mind. She still should have asked, but I understand. \n\nBuy the replacement, take your legos, then let this go.

If mom decided she was tired of storing the bins she could have contacted OP and given him the chance to retrieve his property. If mom, as an over-worked and underpaid, educator saw an opportunity to add value to her classroom, at no cost, and secretly took OP's many legos, worth quite a bit of money, then she owes OP an apology and should give them back. It is very kind, and mature, of OP to offer to buy replacements. I'm guessing everyone knows that $100 of legos off of Craigslist does not equate to 8 large storage boxes and the students will no longer be 'swimming' in legos.
