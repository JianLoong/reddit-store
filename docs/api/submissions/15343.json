Those were legos started by your dad so there is a sentimental value and that\u2019s something you want to share with your kids so it\u2019s only fair you take the legos back.", "NTA.  Your mom and your sneaky wife can buy replacement Lego on Craigslist for her students.  Or ask the students parent's to each contribute a bunch of Lego. Or both. \n\nThey were both dishonest.   They are your Lego, and you made clear you wanted to keep them, very clear.  Zero wrong with wanting to keep something that was yours as a child.  Take all the Lego back at the end of the year.  Inform your mom and wife now, so they can start looking for whatever replacements they need.", "Wow, YWNBTA. My son has about the same amount of Legos that you're describing, he's now 20 and in college. We are holding onto his Legos until he's ready to take them, indefinitely. I would never, ever presume to do anything but store them for him, they are his.\n\nYour mom is the AH here. She should have asked you if it was ok to take them to her classroom, she assumed and it is not ok. You have every right to take them back. Your idea of searching Craig's list is nice, Legos are SUPER expensive!", "NTA-take your Legos back at the end of the school year (you have sentimental attachment to them) and help your mom/wife/school buy some new ones for the classroom. Problem solved. Then, every year for a holiday or something (Christmas maybe?) buy some new ones to add to that classroom collection.\n\nYour mom unfortunately created this mess. She should have talked to you first. But this really isn\u2019t a giant problem, except cost. \n\nAlso, there are some grants through Lego to help fund classrooms. Help your mom apply for one for the school children.", "NTA - maybe buy some replacement Legos on craigslist for your mums classroom so the kids in the class still get to play with lego, but definitely take your own back.", "NAH. \n\nYou haven't checked on these much beloved heirlooms for **several years**. You've gone to college, got married, had kids and didn't even know where these Legos were. \n\nYou aren't an asshole to take them back at end of year (and I commend you for realizing you WOULD be an AH if you demanded them while kids were in school) but do the right thing and buy a class collection. Consider it payment for the YEARS of free storage and maintainence.\n\nDo not complain if any legos are missing. Do not complain about cost of replacement. The classroom probably doesn't care about THESE legos as much as you so you should be able to swap without concern.", "NAH- you have a wife and children why are you still storing your things at your parents house? If you wanted to keep them you shouldn't have left them there for 12 years and I don't blame you're mum for thinking you were never going to want them back. However, since you're willing to wait till the end of the year I think its reasonable to ask for them back, could you not get some second hand ones to give to the classroom instead and just swap? \n\nAlso kinda seems like maybe your wife just doesn't want a ton of lego in the house and is pushing for the school to keep them because of that. As a parent to two young children with a ton of lego I can't judge her for that. It's messy and painful and the kids fight over specific parts constantly. Still fun though!", "NAH.\n\nIn the twelve years since college, you had ample time to reclaim your Lego. It\u2019s reasonable that your teacher-mom put them to use in the interval.\n\nHowever, the kids are now used to having a Lego collection. Your wife and sister are right about that part.\n\nBut fortunately, there\u2019s a simple compromise. Buy Lego for the classroom (new or used, your call), give them to your mom with a thank you for storing yours for over a decade, and take your collection back.", "NTA. You have a sentimental attachment to those Legos and have offered to buy replacements- this is far more than good enough on your part. Your mom agreed to store them for you but never asked to use them for her students and it seems your wife gave permission on your behalf - they are the AHs.", "NAH. \nMy grandparents gave away my barbies to my younger cousins. I'm still mad about it especially as a lot of the stuff had come from pocket money so I do get why your upset.\n\nBut also I do see it from your mum's POV about there being a lot and trying to find a new life for it.", "NAH\nWhy no one consult with you first?", "NAH.\n\nGiven that it's over a decade since you last saw them, I don't really think there's anything wrong with your mother finding a use for the legos. At the same time, they're yours, you never gave them away (and it sounds like you would have picked them up had your mom ever asked you to).\n\nSince you attach sentimental value to those in the classroom, I think you should take those back, but if you can afford it, buy some new ones to donate  to the class to replace the ones you take (trust me, I know how expensive that can be, so I'm not blaming you if you don't donate as many as you take). This works well for putting your own mind at ease (getting your stuff back) and takes care of the kids in the classroom who obviously know that legos are awesome.", "I think getting some craigslist Legos for the classroom would make sense so you can get your Legos back. Sounds like you already solved the problem, if your family will just give them back like they promised. \n\nNAH", "NTA and some people never understand the value you have for them. Why cannot the class get new legos off craiglist? It may mean not much to the kids who might not even notice the difference as opposed to you who dreamed of having the legos to pass down to your own. Go get it as what your mom did was a massive breach of trust.", "If this had happened during the time you were in college or shortly after, it'd be one thing. But 12 years later? NAH", "NAH- \n\n>I had 8 large storage totes of Legos when I left home for college\n\nThat is an absolute fuck ton of legos, just take the ones back that are specially sentimental to you.", "NAH. If it'd been less than 12 years, I might've thrown some heat on your mom for going against your wishes, but this wasn't just you at college, you've had plenty of time to reclaim them if they were importan. That being said, why not do what your wife has suggested and buy new legos from craigslist, and take them to the classroom so you can reclaim yours?", "NTA.\n\neveryone else is but you.\n\nYour mom and wife should have discussed with you beforehand taking the Lego to the classroom. Especially as you mad it very clear that out of anything else the Lego is what you wanted most from your childhood.\n\nI also have Lego from my childhood and having those memories attached to them means more than just random lego ever could (that you'd have to pay and arm and a leg to  get, even used)", "NAH - You had YEARS to reclaim your toys.  My husband's transformers were lovingly played with and broken by his nieces and nephews.  That's what happens when you don't take things.  Your son is 5, you should have anticipated getting Legos before now if you really cared.\n\nFine at the end of the year, but replace them.  They have been used for YEARS in the classroom and you never even knew.", "NAH. Buy some legos and swap them out with the ones in the classroom.", "I think your mom was wrong in not telling you or even asking if you were okay with it, but at the same time, could you not come to a compromise where you only take, say, half? Or take a tote per child, maybe go through them and pick out the ones you know were your dads or are particularly special to you? Otherwise, I have to agree with your wife, the best place for that amount of legos is where they will best be enjoyed. Your children will enjoy the legos whether they were handed down or brand new, children at that age can hardly tell the difference.", "NAH\n\nI read your comment about going to school in another state and not moving to the area until 2021. When you were done with school and home for a visit you could have shipped them to where you were living or ask your mom to do or get them when you moved back.\n\nYou didn't need them until now, so you let it be, out of sight out of mind. Your mom stored them for years.  You didn't do anything to get them until recently.\n\nYour mom should have asked before she brought them into the school or given you a timeframe to get them or she'd donate the Legos.\n\nWhy not ask your wife to photograph the ones that are special to the kids, leave those or some of those and add the replacement ones you get. Maybe they can make a big deal about the new arrivals.\n\nCheck out local buy nothing groups on Facebook. You can post an ISO Legos for Special Education class and people may respond.", "ESH, but come on.\n\nYour mother should have given you a last chance to get your Lego totes before taking them to the classroom, that's true.  My bet is that you would have just insisted she continue acting as your free storage unit though.\n\nYou had 12 years to figure out whether these were important to you or not.  Once you left home for good, you essentially agreed that what you left behind was of less consequence.", "NTA, but you should both be aware that old Lego (pre 1970s) can be degraded & have lead, cadmium & other harmful stuff. Anything made since 1981 is ok according to Lego.  It's something in the colourants , so not all blocks are affected. \nNewer lego is easier to sanitize as you can just chuck it in a pillowcase in the washing machine on cool. (It's made of ABS).", "ESH- sorry dude. you waited 12 years to go get them, you had plenty of time to grab them and chose to leave them.  So special that you didn't even touch them or even see them for 12 years.\n\nI'd talk to your mom, see if SOME of the lego can go back with you, that way the kids would still have some in the classroom and you'd still have a some to give to your kids to add onto.\n\nI changed mine because, mom should have let you know about the lego in the classroom.", "ESH.  Your mom should have given you one last chance to claim them, but that chance should have been years ago.   You have a family of your own,  but expect mommy to hang onto your crap indefinitely?", "Teacher here, you would NTA. No chance. If their students need Lego, they can use the school budget to buy them.", "NTA. They are important to you. If you can, buy new lego for the school. The kid there will probably enjoy that even more.", "Nta, its your stuff. Altho, you left those things there for years, so idk what you expected to happen", "NTA.  It's always mind blowing to me when someone steals something and then has the gall to tell them they need to just get over it. Get your Legos back, the only reason your wife doesn't see it as a big deal is because it isn't something of hers.", "It\u2019s a tough call here. On the one hand, you have these legos that are rightfully your property and your mom doesn\u2019t seem to have asked you permission to take them to her classroom (after you expressly said you wanted them). Now you want them back, and are entitled to them, as they are yours. \n\nOn the other hand, you have special needs children that find change hard. Could you maybe replace some (if not all) for the classroom? You could take yours for your children, but the children in mom\u2019s class would still have *some* legos to play with. I don\u2019t think you should have to fully fund this, and you have no legal obligation to do so. But maybe you and mom can come up with a budget and then go about finding some as cheaply as you can (Craigslist, eBay, etc) to put in her classroom for those children. \n\nLike I say, you have no *legal* obligation to do this, but *morally*? IDK. Perhaps. \n\nIt sucks that mom did this without your express permission, as they weren\u2019t hers to do as she pleased. But it would also suck for those children to lose out because of it.\n\nEdit: typo", "Y T A - if you call them Legos you don\u2019t deserve them \n\nKidding \u2026 kidding \u2026 I\u2019m a Lego nerd\n\nNAH\nI can see why you want them back and why your mom thought it would be safe to use them after 12 years. A different take from someone who volunteered in schools for years: you may not want them back. Kids are gross and even worse with things that aren\u2019t theirs. I\u2019d leave them and get new ones.", "NTA, your legos, that you specifically stated were yours and you would like to keep them,  even offered to take them with you, were stolen from you.", "NTA. They are yours, your mom said she would keep them until you wanted them, she knew they were important to you and didn\u2019t ask you before she took them. The kids in the class can get cheap replacements, but your Legos are yours. They have sentimental value for you. If your mom didn\u2019t want the kids in her class to loose them, she shouldn\u2019t have given them to them without your consent or permission.", "NTA if i had my mom hold something that had some value from a family member and let someone use it i wiuld want it back too.  \n\nI would take em back and the end of the year and your mom could just tell them she bought new ones to the students.", "Ask wife and sis why mom can't buy new legos? The old ones are yours, the kits are probably discontinued, and you want them back.\n\nNTA", "So you are NTA.  \n Honestly. I\u2019d be throwing $100 at my mom so she can buy her own GD legos and getting mine back the minute I knew what happened to my personal heirlooms (and yes I\u2019d classify these at that level). I\u2019d be the epitome of the elmo in flames gif and so mad if my mom did this to my Barbie\u2019s and my little pony collection. \nYou thought they were safe, and she said she would store them. Had she said \u201ccome get these or I\u2019m bringing them for the crumb grabbers at school.\u201d You would have figured something out for storage, or could have been nice and let her bring them in. I\u2019m irritated on your behalf.", "NTA- My mom did something very similar to me while I was in college. She pressured me into saying yes \"you never use them anyway,\" and \"you're aunt was always under the presumption that we would give the table back.\" So the Legos that were purchased for me, were then given to my cousin for her students. I'll never forgive my mom for that as I had many set that are now deemed pretty valuable from a collector's standpoint. \n\nAnd what do you know, that 'aunt' had been nothing but rude to my family since my mom is now gone.\n\nNTA- I feel your pain. I'm never going to forgive my mom for getting rid of my Legos.", "NTA, some of those sets are classics that can never be replaced but the class some sets and get your old ones back", "My mother is a teacher.  I experienced the same thing.  I have a solution for you.  Go to the class.  Watch the kids playing with those Legos and absolutely loving it while they let their imaginations build all sorts of amazing and funny things.  For me it really helped because the child in my heart remembered all the fun I had with those Legos and it was Cathartic to see that after a few decades those same Legos were making dozens of kids happy.  I know they aren't cheap, but you and your kids will love picking out new sets and putting them together.  You're not an AH, you want to keep that kid inside of you alive.  There's nothing wrong with that.  I think the kids in your mother's class can help you do just that.  :)", "NTA\n\nYou specifically said you wanted them and your Mum didn\u2019t ask you if it was ok to take them to school. I understand it was a long time ago so asking would be reasonable but if you agree to keep something safe for someone you keep it safe.", "Absolute NTA. I would absolutely dgaf about the special ed kids. Thats a xour mom Problem and not a you Problem. She STOLE your Lego. \nEven if its 12 years. You had an agreement to store them. Period. \nShe should have asked first. So she will have to solve that Problem on her own.", "NTA. Your mother, wife and sister can buy LEGO if it's so important for those kids.", "NTA. Ask for them back, or its theft.", "NTA\n\nPlease do buy the kids some replacements at the end of the year.", "Come on. 12 years????? I kind of see why but at least replace them.\nYta.", "YTA if you wanted them so much you should have got them years ago instead of using your mom's as a free storage facility.

I'm probably going to be downvoted for this, but even though they are special needs children, that doesn't mean that they should be coddled to this extent. Especially if you're offering to replace them. They will not care that they aren't the same, because chances are extremely high that they aren't building the intended sets, but more so letting their imaginations and creativity run free.

You can also occasionally find some at Estate Sales for pretty cheap too.\n\nI will note though, as I have in a few other comments, I had to leave some stuff out of my post that I *thought* weren't pertinent due to the 3000 character post limit, but I am thinking they are way more pertinent.\n\nI grew up in Oregon & went to school in Texas, and I lived there until 2021. We moved back to Oregon as my wife wanted to become a SpEd teacher, and programs & pay are much better in Oregon, plus, we both wanted to get out of Texas.\n\nWhen I left home, my mom said that she would keep them until I wanted them back. Similarly, she's still storing things for my siblings that they want, but don't quite have room for yet. Most notably, she's storing a couch for my oldest sister as she doesn't have room for it yet. I am not trying to excuse using her as free storage, but nobody has voiced any concern or frustration about storing items there.\n\nI have a great relationship with my mom, as do my siblings, so I don't think there was any malicious intent on her part. But my wife thinks that the kids will be quite upset as they are attached to \"some of the pieces in your collection\"", "Agree, but just want to add that he did know where they were. They were in his Mom\u2019s attic in 8 storage bins. He\u2019s not responsible for knowing that she moved them without telling him.", "It was incredibly rude of mom to just take them without asking OP.  I would never do that to my kid", ">several years\n\n12 years", "He offered to take them so they wouldn't be a burden to anyone, his mom told him it was fine. He has every right to expect them back without having to worry about others. I get that you think she should put them to use, but if she thought they were just \"lying around\" then OPs mom should have contacted him to come get them, or at the very least asked before bringing them in.\nThe fair solution in this situation is for OP to take back his Legos and for his mom to buy new ones for her class.\nNTA", "They're at a school, they're all mixed together now, it's too late to piece them out.", "Sorry, as part of the 3000-character limit thing, I had to cut some things out that I thought were not pertinent- but maybe they are. I went to school across the country & my wife and I lived several states away until 2021. We moved back to my area as my wife wanted to become a Special Education teacher, and my mom was willing to stay at the school until my wife is licensed & hand the classroom over. Pay in our state for SpEd teachers is significantly higher than anywhere else. Plus, I had always wanted to move back to my state, so this was perfect timing.\n\nThe idea of getting the Legos back didn't even pop into my head until we bought our place now as we've been renting for a few years.\n\nAs for buying on Craigslist, that's my plan, but my wife is still concerned as some kids are attached to specific pieces (which is a bit much, but they are Special Needs students, so I believe it) and she's not sure which ones are \"special\" ones.", ">I even offered to come pick them up & store them with me while I was in college, so they weren't a burden. My mom said it was fine, she would keep them stored. Great.\n\nOP attempted to reclaim them, mom said don't worry about it. Probably because she'd already taken them.\nNTA", "Sorry - I said in another comment that I had to cut out due to a character limit: up until a few years ago, we lived several states away. I grew up in Oregon and went to school in Texas. We've lived in Texas until 2021 when we moved back as my wife wanted to become a SpEd teacher and pay for SpEd teachers is better in Oregon.\n\nI didn't think it was pertinent, but in hindsight, I should have left it in because it's probably important. A few others have brought it up.", "Technically when you leave something at someone else's house for 12 years you've abandoned it and it isn't yours anymore.", "Poor take. He DID offer to get them and store them himself. SHE told him it was fine. It's amazing at how many people view stealing as okay...", "NTA.\n\nHe offered to store them himself, mom told him she would store them.  Then Mom used stuff that wasn't hers, likely after wife lied and said she asked him and he said it was okay.", "Because they think just because they paid for it, they own it, and children can\u2019t own anything they receive as a child even after they grow up?", "Wife didn't want the legos in her house.", "I don't. He offered to take them and store them himself, but she said she would store them without an issue. She then took his legos and repurposed them, without telling him, which implies she knew he wouldn't approve.\n\nIf he would have known she would end up giving them away (as that's essentially what happened here), then I suspect OP would have taken them with them.\n\nMalice or not, Mom is the asshole, and as they say, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.", "She should have asked him first, period.", "Its only for the fact that OP did offer to take them with him so his mom wouldn't have to worry about them, if his mom didn't want to store them anymore its on her to speak up about it.", "I don\u2019t think she did it maliciously or I would have called her an AH. \n\nThe same goes for Mom doesn\u2019t it? Can\u2019t she just as easily run it past him before moving them? Heck, she probably needed help moving them!", "Doesn\u2019t sound forgotten to me. He asked specifically for her to store them or else he would do it himself. Putting something in storage is not the same as forgetting it somewhere.", "I would agree except for the fact that he offered to store them himself and she didn\u2019t check with him. I think the mom was in the wrong because the only reason he left them there for so long was because she told him not to worry about it after he offered to store them himself. She did not have the right to take his things. Was it malicious? I don\u2019t think so, but it was still wrong of her. NTA and best option is probably to just buy new legos for the classroom (which is what should have been done from the beginning)", "Legos are different though, this isn\u2019t a beat up teddy bear, Legos are 1) expensive AF and 2) can hold a lot of meaning for some people like OP. Depending on the amount of legos it could be HUNDREDS of dollars to replace", "The thing about legos that they may not understand is that if you have certain sets, especially old ones, then some of those bricks may be hard to find/replace. I bet they\u2019re using them to create all new things instead of creating the sets based on the instruction they\u2019re made for. You can easily get a big replacement box of mixed legos for them that will work just as well, but buying replacements for specific sets (that are likely discontinued) will be difficult and you are likely already missing pieces. \n\nLegos were a huge part of my childhood and my brother got a set from my dad that he got when he was a kid. I\u2019m sad we got rid of a lot of my sets when I moved out, but we took the time to put them back in their original sets (yes by indexing and sorting each piece in the instructions) to sell at a better price. It made sense for me then, but I miss some that I wish I could\u2019ve passed on. \n\nDefinitely NTA and maybe explain to them how sets require specific pieces and starting over on a collection would mean spending a lot of money on discontinued sets or not replacing them at all. A lot of people don\u2019t want to sort the sets back out once they\u2019ve been mixed, so buying a big mixed box will be perfect for a classroom.", "Just a note about buying secondhand LEGO... expect to clean them.\n\nI think putting them in some kind of laundry bag and running it through the dishwasher is a standard method. You might also filter for whether the LEGO has been in a home with a smoker, because the smell is hard to get off, too.", "Really consider if you want those pieces when time comes. Especially knowing you can get them back.", "If these legos are so important to you, why don't you buy legos off craigslist or whatever for the classroom to replace the ones you're taking back.", "At some point the kids would loose access to the specific pieces (leave the class), so that is not an argument. Replacements will be fine.", "I\u2019m an educator and your wife is full of shit. The kids will be happy there is still Lego and excited that there is new Lego. Stuff changes in schools all the time and the kids are ok. There is absolutely no reason you can\u2019t take yours back. The only thing I can think of is your wife knows they\u2019ve been damaged or lost and doesn\u2019t want you to know.", "I mean he offered 12 years ago. That's a ridiculous amount of time to expect someone to store stuff for you.", "If it wasn\u2019t leaving things with a parent, I\u2019d agree. Or if OP hadn\u2019t offered to pick them up so that they weren\u2019t a burden, and in response the parent then agrees to store the legos for them. \n\nI just think mom should have at least started a conversation with \u201cOP, you\u2019ve left these legos here for 12 years now. I think it\u2019s time you picked them up or I put them to use in my classroom/throw them out/etc\u201d. \n\nAsking to use them for her class wouldn\u2019t have hurt her. Not saying she\u2019s an AH or anything, just think it sucks that she didn\u2019t bring the topic up *before* deciding to take them to school. \n\nUltimately, if I was OP, I would give them up and let the kids have them *or* buy some replacements for the class so as not to leave them without.", "He said he could take them 12 years ago and never checked in since?  \n\nHe is at least 30 years old.  If something means that much to you and you haven\u2019t laid eyes on it in TWELVE YEARS\u2026.  It really doesn\u2019t mean that much to you.", "Probably has sensitive feet", "Sure! Does it make her an AH? Not really. They had a Convo about it 12 years ago...people forget. It's not like she sold them or threw them out. He can get them back and they have been making children happy for years while OP was building his life. What a bitch!", "But N T A means that someone is the A H in the story just not OP. Only one in the story exept OP is his mom. \n\nMaybe you meant NAH.", "In the 12 years, very understandable if she forgets the significance of them.", "Or she doesn't want *that* much Legos in their home. I don't know, the fact that she knew and tried to talk around it sounds sneaky. Why not just buy the classroom some replacement Legos and get OP's original back?", "> The only thing I can think of is your wife knows they\u2019ve been damaged or lost\n\nI would be willing bet a couple hundred that those Legos are nowhere near the condition that tbey once were in, and the collection is definitely not close to its original size anymore", "I think mom should have said something to OP after they graduated college for sure - which would have been like 8 years ago. Communication was lacking there. \n\nBut pretty well all kids leave stuff at their parents. Parents aren't obligated to store this stuff forever. They can do what they please with it, especially after kid has purchased their own home, gotten married and had kids. \n\nAnd since he offered to pick it up and store it... Twelve years ago... Before owning his own place and having kids, I wouldn't be surprised if mom simply forgot about it.", "But it's still yours.  And someone else was storing it, at their own insistence, for you.  So yes, still NTA.", "I kinda doubt that, especially as wife was cagey about them.  She knew, and when mom asked/ told her, she should have said something.", "True. But me as a mom, if I came across something I\u2019d forgotten that my son left behind, I\u2019d just ask him do I dump it or does he want to fetch it. I wouldn\u2019t assume he didn\u2019t want it, even though it is 12 years. I mean, that\u2019s a long time, sure. But I guess I\u2019m just one of these like my late grandmother, that would hold onto something or ask the person the item belonged to. \n\nMy grandmother held onto things for me that I left behind when my son and I moved out but didn\u2019t have space for. Some of it she kept for many years because of me moving etc. Eventually, I went to her house and went through everything left and made choices what to do with. But she would never have done anything with anything that I left behind. \n\nI guess it\u2019s just my personal preference. We\u2019re all different, after all.\n\nEdit: typo"]}
