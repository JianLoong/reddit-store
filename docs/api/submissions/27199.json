{"id": 27199, "submission_id": "16mr162", "title": "WIBTA for Spilling the Beans on my BFF's Creepy Husband?", "selftext": "I (42f) find myself in a challenging situation within my tight-knit mom-friend group, which includes Allie, Emilia, and Cara. We've been close friends for nearly a decade, and our kids have grown up together. However, there's a growing concern within our group about Allie's husband, Matt (50m), and I'm grappling with whether I should address it.\n\nAllie and Matt have had their fair share of relationship issues, reaching a point this summer where Allie considered ending things with him and asking him to move out. In the end, she decided to stay with him, but it's left some of us feeling uneasy.  They have a son (10).\n\nEmilia, Cara, and I are all disturbed by Matt's behavior. He often makes inappropriate comments about or to our daughters, who range in ages from 6 to 12. Frankly, it's concerning, and it raises alarms about whether this could potentially be categorized as grooming behavior. Moreover, Matt has an unsettling obsession with Cara, who is happily married, and she's felt uncomfortable around him for years.\n\nEmilia and I have reached a point where we don't want our daughters around Matt without constant supervision, not even for a second. It's gone to the extent that we won't let our children be left alone with Allie in case Matt is around. This situation has led us to decline constant invitations from Allie for various activities, from playdates to vacations. We either make up excuses or carefully plan get-togethers to minimize contact with Matt.\n\nWhat's more, a friend of mine who met Matt once independently expressed concerns about leaving her children alone with him. These concerns aren't isolated but seem to be a shared sentiment among those who've interacted with him.  We do not know if Allie sees any of this.Matt's troubling behavior isn't limited to the issues with our kids. He has a history of not paying child support for his disabled child from a prior marriage, excessive drinking, and failing to contribute equally to their family responsibilities. His traumatic childhood experiences have also left him struggling to connect with Allie's family.\n\nNow, Emilia, Cara and I face a moral dilemma. Should we sit down with Allie and discuss how Matt makes us feel, even though she hasn't asked for our input? On one hand, we feel that if the roles were reversed, we would want to know if our partner's behavior was causing concerns among our closest friends. On the other hand, bringing up the issue unprompted could have significant consequences for Allie's life.\n\nWe're stuck between our duty as her closest friends to be honest and our fear that discussing Matt without her prompting might cross a line. We're concerned about the impact on our friendship with Allie, as she may assume we don't want to spend time with her when, in reality, it's Matt we'd rather avoid.\n\nWIBTA for telling Allie about our concerns regarding Matt, even if she hasn't asked?\n\nEDITED: to break up paragraphs", "created_utc": 1695130075, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16mr162/wibta_for_spilling_the_beans_on_my_bffs_creepy/", "score": 126, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I believe that whomever is Allie's closest friend in your friend group should take the opportunity to name specific instances when Matt made inappropriate comments about any of your children. Personally, I would have addressed this earlier this summer when she was considering separating from him. Her life sounds especially stressful. Having a spouse with a drinking problem is difficult enough, but adding the other issues makes it that much harder.\n\nI also have a feeling that some or all of you have been thriving on the drama because none of you stepped up earlier this summer and individually reached out to Allie. \n\nNTA for protecting your kids. Remember that Allie is likely going to be very defensive and angry that a man she continues to choose apparently has been doing/saying inappropriate comments/things for awhile, and rather than going to her immediately, you talk about her/Matt.", "I would want to know.

Maybe she is staying because she thinks their son needs a Dad.  \n\nThis Matt sounds creepy, is pretty much a deadbeat to his disabled kid, and drinking too much.  Protecting any children must be the priority.  Allie is probably better off getting away from this man sooner than later.  Hopefully, she will make the right decision.", "I do think concerns like this need to be brought up but it most likely won't end well for the friendship.  Then again if she was already on the edge ready to leave him maybe this will be the push she needs to finally go through with it.   NTA", "NTA did these issues start before this summer? Either way both you and Cara are uncomfortable leaving your children alone with Matt and uncomfortable with how he behaves towards Cara.

It may end a long friendship, but is your friendship more important than the safety of your children? It\u2019s not unprompted, it\u2019s a necessary conversation that should have happened already. \n\nI may sound harsh but I would not keep quiet to my friends if their partner was making gross comments about my daughter.

Maybe this will slowly break her down.  Maybe she will go NC with all three of you.\n\nin any case, all three of you need to be clear with Allie that, whatever she is saying in the heat of the moment now, you will be there for her in the future If she needs it.

If/when her son has female friends over or later on girlfriends, it's better to protect them too.\n\nBut when you bring it up, make sure it's just you guys (no kids, not in a cafe or anything, etc) so he discussion is private and less awkward for her. Anticipate denial, but be supportive and honest.", "Ok your most important duty is to your children. And clearly it's a valid concern since it's been mentioned by others outside your immediate friend circle. I don't see any way to sugarcoat it with Allie, you all need to be honest with her, as kindly as possible. It will likely end your friendship, but I would consider that a price I'm willing to pay for the safety of my little ones.\n NTA", "INFO: \n\nWhy is it your job and her responsibility to police him?

He has no men around him? \n\nwhy aren\u2019t these men aren\u2019t outraged and defending their daughters?", "NTA here\u2019s the thing. If there is an adult in your friend group, even by marriage who is ever around your kids you cannot know if something will happen where they will accidentally be left alone with this adult. An emergency, a mix up in the play date, whatever. You cannot stay friends with someone who is potentially going to bring this adult or expose your kids to this adult. Basically, you cannot continue to let your kids be around Allie or her kids as long as she\u2019s married to Matt. There\u2019s too much potential that he\u2019ll have accidental access to do something. \n\nMy advice is to sit Allie down as a group and explain your concerns about his behavior towards female children. That way she sees it\u2019s not just one person. Don\u2019t bring up her marriage or his other issues. Those are none of your business. Then explain that so long as he\u2019s living in a house with her and she\u2019s married to him your kids cannot be around her kids or her. Basically that you\u2019re breaking up with her as a friend because your kids are more important than her feelings. Period. If she breaks it off with him set up ground rules that he can never be with the kids or anywhere near the house when they have a play date. If she doesn\u2019t break up with him then ghost her. You can\u2019t have that uncertainty in your life.", "NTA arguably you and your friends are the assholes for exposing your kids to this man for so long. Even supervised.

Guess you'll see!", "NTA- you should always listen to you gut feelings about people. I grew up going to regular gatherings with my parents friends and their kids and there was one boy I never liked and stayed away from even though he was a year younger than me. Come to find out years later he had been assaulting a younger girl at these gatherings from when he was 12-18. The things he is saying could be innocent BUT if they seem weird they probably are.

This is seriously alarming behaviour. \n\nIf you don\u2019t tell her and he escalates his behaviour, an innocent child is going to be traumatized (more than they already are bc you said he\u2019s made gross comments already), and it could have been prevented. I\u2019m not going to worst case scenario to be dramatic, but because it\u2019s honestly likely based on what you\u2019ve said.", "YTA don\u2019t do it. She clearly knows a lot (if not all of) those issues. You said she almost broke up with him recently. You will just make her feel judged and then further isolated/alone. That\u2019s part of the DV cycle. Protect your kids/yourself and be a supportive friend. She will be more likely to leave him if she has support and sitting her down to point out all the problems isn\u2019t support.", "Has anyone called out Matt\u2019s comments in the moment?

I can guarantee you she knows there's an issue but may not know how to approach it-  I think you need to talk to Allie. Have some specific incidents, not just \" he makes us uncomfortable\" - let her know you've been working around him but you just can't anymore. I'm sure she'll be upset but give her some time and then reach out. You may very well end up losing her as a friend, but if what you suspect is true that's a small price to pay", "NTA: as of now, your children are well and protected, but what happens if other people leave their children with him? You need to tell her.. At least she will know. You\u2019re not just on the lookout to protect your kids. It\u2019s all the kids he might come in contact within that certain age range. If you see something say something.", "If that many of you think the husband is creepy, then he is creepy.  \n\nSadly, it is unlikely your friend will really be able to accept it if you tell her - yet I still think you should.  Work with your other 3 friends on a way to have a sit-down with her and tell her in a gentle and supporting way the specific things he has done that have made all of you uncomfortable. \n\nI have been in a similar situation, and eventually the creepy husband was \"outed\" by a paternity suit.  The wife then apologized to those of us who had tried to tell her (because she didn't listen).", "NTA - you need to warn Allie, and you all need to be having conversations with your daughters about how to spot icky behavior. I'm not talking stranger danger, because this guy is likely considered a trusted adult by the kids, but how to listen to those voices inside ourselves that we sometimes don't listen to, especially as young women and girls. You need to get your respective spouses on board, too.

OP, as long as your friend group is on the same page (so you won't be thrown out for saying something), I would schedule a time for the four of you to meet up in public. I would tell her, \"Listen, we wanted to talk to about something really important. We love you. We love your son. But we need to address something. Would that be okay?\" \"We love you very much and love spending time with you, but we no longer want to be around your husband in anyway. We find the way he behaves towards our daughters alarming.\" Give specific examples. \"We find the way he behaves around Cara alarming.\" Give specific examples. \"We know you love him and that he's your husband, but we're no longer willing to put ourselves, or our children, in any situation where he'll be around. We want to continue inviting you out and spending time with you, but we felt we couldn't dance around why we're not wanting to come to your house or be around your husband without telling you. Can you understand where we're coming from?\"\n\nLet her talk. As you discuss, feel out how SHE feels about her husband and this situation. Maybe this will be the thing that gets her to divorce him.

I hate that, I hate the pushing physical contact, especially in this day and age within our generation who should know better.\n\nAnd gross that he's thinking about them as teenagers and rescuing them and getting them alone essentially. I don't think it is innocuous, because the phrasing isn't the normal \"oh you're so beautiful you're going to break hearts\" it's so much more personal than that.\n\nIf it helps I think you're right. I've been in a similar-ish situation once. A man within my family and no one understood why I hated him. I couldn't even tell you why I did, he just creeped me out, my gut told me. Caused arguments because I was rude to him... that was until it came out he was hiding cameras in private places to get me and other female family members and friends caught undressing/bathing. My gut was right. Trust yours, because even that messed me up for a while (well past it now, but christ it gave me a complex about cameras). You can't take the risk, especially when it's you'd kids.", "u/Sea-Repeat7146 I implore you to listen to me.\n\nThis part is straight up-grooming. Like... textbook level: \u201cwhen they\u2019re teens and out at a party in going to be their hero and I\u2019M the one they\u2019re going to call if they need help!\u201d\n\nPart of it is that when they are in a vulnerable situation they would trust him (and SOLELY him) enough to call him for their \"rescue\". But what it really is, is him pre-arranging to be able to white-knight them later, which is an emotional debt, and also having access to them while in a vulnerable state so that he could 'comfort' them and 'save' them and they will then have a \"special bond with\" him. That is very literally and EXACTLY grooming. The offer of being someone more important than their own parents, with a secret situation and vulnerability. **I cannot stress enough that this dude needs to be kept away from your kids.** *PLEASE share this with the other women so that they understand the severity...*.\n\nIt's the mental situation he is preparing and pre-establishing that is a serious issue. Come to HIM versus their own parents. See HIM as their savior, someone they NEED. He wont tell their secrets, and they can have secrets of their own. See what I mean???", "Nope, this is seriously concerning. The guilting for a hug, the talking about them as teens and him being some savior, the focus on their appearance. \n\nWe have a friend who really adores my 3 year old. He\u2019s older, his daughters are grown. I didn\u2019t get any feeling from him, but I didn\u2019t love how he sort of lit up when he saw her, and made comments like \u201cshe\u2019s SO CUTE\u201d \n\nSo I just watched carefully. He never puts her on the spot, never demands her attention, never ever asks for or suggests a hug, is very respectful of her space, and focuses more on her cutesy stuff and compares to when his kids were that young. It put me at ease. But I watched carefully to get there. And I saw that he\u2019s similar with all little kids. He\u2019s just someone who is good with kids. Cool. \n\nThis dude is NOT putting anyone at ease. He seems to actively want to corner them with compliments and he\u2019s *seeking to establish a special connection with them* (the \u201cI\u2019ll be their hero\u201d bs). He also feels entitled to physical affection. \n\nTell his wife. Lead with \u201cI get that may not be his intent but it concerns me, and it\u2019s not a way to behave with them.\u201d", "Ewwww! Matt is gross. Saying those kinds of things is gross and weird and not normal.", "Eww that's disgusting! Yep. Your friend needs an intervention. There's a good chance she's already seen the red flags but she's choosing to ignore them. Or she'll try to rationalize his behavior. Either way, is unfair to expect the rest of you to deal with him", "Maybe just one or two of you, in a private space, and saying up front that you have something difficult to discuss but you are doing it because you love her and think she needs to be aware.\n\nShe very likely will get defensive and upset, maybe angry regardless.", "What u/Sweeper1985 said, start one-on-one. Might even be best if Cara does it since she's seen more of it first-hand (directed at her). There's a huge dynamic change in a group setting. Sometimes that's good but the best thing is to start individual. If she absolutely refuses to recognize any of these issues, that might be when you want to all meet with her together.", "[removed]", "Good. Being the one who is talked about by the rest of the friend group makes that person feel very isolated, and wonder why didn't they just come to me. Good luck!", "pls keep us updated tho (if you\u2019d like to)", "Yikes that's a long time. It's better to talk to your friend and let her know.", "The intervention approach is usually overwhelming, and doesn't leave the person you are concerned about enough time to process the huge array of emotions they need to process.  Great if you are pushing an addict to rehab, not great for someone who is going to need to make some slower and more deliberate changes.  She needs time to process as well as know she has an intact support system, and then she can plan from there.", "I hate to say it, but considering Matt's behaviour toward the girls, I wouldn't put it past him to push his son to extend the invitation for a sleepover.", "You are a good friend and I'm rooting for Allie to get away from this guy!!", "but even if he did not make these comments, i would still be creeped out by him.", "I've just read back my comment and realised it may have come across as more critical than intended so my apologies if it did. I wasn't trying to indicate that you aren't protecting them now, more reaffirming you are doing the right thing and agreeing that your kids come first. I meant more that you have to tell her really, because eventually she'll notice you're all distancing yourselves from him (and by extension her) and so it's better to be upfront and clear about your boundaries even if that means your friend takes her husband's side.", "Google the Missing Stair it might be helpful to understand this dynamic", "This is really good advice.", "The friend better not have any daughters. No one is required to put their children in the path of a predator. Their first responsibility is the safety of their children. Ally is not a priority, the kids are.", "That said, its good to not just spring this on someone in a group setting when everybody isn't on the same page. ;-)", "For Allie?", "It\u2019s also something the 3 of us felt gross about independently, before I even brought it up with them", "Also, I\u2019m sorry you had to go through with that but glad that you listened to your gut", "yes, i do 100%, it's as clear as day when you explain it that way to me.", "Emilia and I could do it together since our worries are related to our daughters and Cara\u2019s is direct.", "Yeah, the woman he is obsessed with probably shouldn't be there.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

The kids are absolutely the first priority, but not allowing Allie to be completely isolated is a wise move as well.

Had someone mentioned it to my aunt I wouldve never been a victim nor his daughter.", "I would do it separately, get her thinking about why rather than feel embarrassed in front of the group.

God forbid he fixate on other kids after this.", "I really hope the answer is no, but I would also talk to your kids to see if he's already done something. I didn't tell anyone about being molested for years when I was a kid. I didn't know that I was supposed to, and I was scared. You can't undo anything that may or may not already have been done, but you can get your kids help to deal with the aftermath as quickly as possible.", "Make sure that you have a different conversation with your daughter and that the other moms do the same.  Let her (daughter) know that you will always listen to her and that if something ever feels weird or uncomfortable that she can leave/contact you immediately.
