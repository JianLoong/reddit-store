Why do you have to respect their culture when they don't seem to respect yours?", "Sounds to me like they're using their culture as an excuse. How is your behavior disrespectful to their culture, but theirs not disrespectful to yours?\n\nIf it were me I'd tell them \"You have two options. Option 1 is, I can treat you like children and lie to you, and when I'm planning something, I can tell you to get there 2 hours earlier than I tell everyone else. Option 2 is, when I tell you a time, you can take it as given that I mean my culture's time and not yours. Your choice.\"\n\nIn any case, NTA.", "NTA \n\nSpeaking as someone who comes from a multicultural family with members from literally all over the world.

I'm not an especially punctual person but I would **never** expect other people to hang around waiting for me to arrive. That's rude.\n\nIf you feel that you want to make the effort to keep the friendship, consider being clear about your cut-off times.\n\nE.g.:\n- the birthday party starts at 2pm and the magician will entertain the kids until 3pm\n- everyone is coming at 6pm and we're eating at 6.30pm\n- we can meet for lunch at 12.30pm but I have to leave at 2.30pm for an appointment\n- the movie starts at 7pm so I'll wait for you until 6.45\n\nHowever, you should consider no longer inviting them to your home.

Get friends who actually respect you, these people think they're too good for everyone around them.", "NTA. Saying being late is a culture is a lame excuse.", "NTA. Your culture is being on time, they aren't respecting that.

Otherwise, tell them that you seem to live in different time zones.", "NTA, I know different cultures put different meanings on what being on time and timeliness means, but I\u2019ve never heard of a culture that would expect people to consistently change their plans and adjust their schedule to accommodate them. It was YOUR home. Most cultures fully respect that.", "NTA\n\nLived in a place where this attitude was much more common for a short while and it is a very difficult attitude to get used to if you\u2019re not accustomed to it.

I\u2019ve never heard of any culture that being late is a given or even acceptable. Rude.", "NTA.

Most of the time, when we have family gatherings, it is basically the whole day, and people come whenever they can.\n\nThey are being disrespect for being extremely late and being rude about it.

You have a culture too.  Your culture values punctuality, and your friends consistently fail to respect it.", "NTA, that\u2019s BS. They aren\u2019t respecting your daughter.

I know there are many cultures that do value flexible time/\"running late\" and that OP's strict approach to time is a capitalist-colonial effort (illustrated by \"I have shit to do\" after a child's birthday party). It's not that OP is wrong for existing within this capitalist-colonialist structure, but I can't fault people for resisting it.\n\nWe have cultural miscommunication happening here.

If we had to leave at 5, she wouldn't even be ready and still be smoking a \"last cigarette\" (one of multiple last cigarettes) and playing games on her phone. She would sit there and watch us all get ready, and listen to us tell her 10 times that hey, we need to leave in 1 hr... 30 minutes... 15 minutes.... etc. Then wonder why we'd get upset that she just started doing a full face of makeup 5 minutes before we need to leave. Or we'd call her, and she'd tell us she was just leaving the house.... three times..... \n\nWe used to lie to her and tell her three hours early so she MIGHT have a chance of being on time for something. She'd still be at least 30 minutes late. And it seemed like the more strict the time requirement, the later she would be. \n\nShe had no concept of others needs and time requirements. Eventually nobody invited her anywhere because her concept of time was incompatible with everyone else and it was impossible to get her to understand. It was her world and we were expected to make her world work. \n\nIt got tolerated for a long time because she was newly widowed and people felt bad for her.
