(Example wrote 3 on the invite, and write 12 on everyone else's so everyone would arrive closer to 3)\nI've had to do this for some of my family members to.

I have no idea why these friends are being late in purpose and saying it's culture.\n\nGranted i cannot prove that the culture in question is chilean but given that this is apparently common in hispanic countries i don't think i'm far off with saying that people in their culture who arrive late aren't doing it on purpose and these friends just don't want to leave their houses early, or something.\n\nP.S.: For the record the \"arrive late\" thing happening is always in informal situations.

You learn by watching your parents/family/friends do it. \n\nThere's tons of unwritten rules we either learn by observing or are taught as very young children (and often don't remember learning.) \n\nFor instance, how far to stand away from someone. You probably don't think about that, but that's a cultural norm that we more or less pick up by osmosis and it is very uncomfortable when someone stands too close. And if someone stands too far away, you'll probably think they're uncomfortable around you and pay extra attention to not appearing threatening. \n\nAnother is where to touch a stranger if you need their attention. You'd automatically go for the shoulders/upper arms, using your pointer finger or the tips of multiple fingers, right? But it's likely you haven't been explicitly taught that shoulder area is the least intimate of the body. You just know. \n\nSame for timeliness. You learn when it's okay to be early, when it's okay to be late, and when it's okay to be right on time. (You might show up early for your best friend's party; show up late to a casual hang; be right on time for dinner reservations, for example.) And for the late and early, you usually learn by how much - if you ended up being an hour early to a new friend's party, you'd likely go wait in a coffee shop. For your best friend, you'd probably text and say hey here early can I help set up?"]}
