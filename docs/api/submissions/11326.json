SIL and I both consider ourselves pretty good cooks and usually always share the responsibility of making the food for family dinners or lunches when we all get together, since it's something we both enjoy. \n\nWe both like to brag about our HOMEMADE tres leches cakes. We always have friendly banter with each other about how \"mine would kick yours ass\", \"mine would put your to shame\" etc. This is 100% in a joking way and how we joke around with each other, SIL and I had a great relationship with each other. Or so I thought.\n\nSo we decided we were going to actually see who's cake tasted better at a recent family dinner that we had. We BOTH agreed before hand that it would just be for jokes and there would be no hard feeling's (obviously because it's just a cake). Boy was I wrong.\n\nFast forward we finish dinner and it's dessert time. SIL and I bring out our cakes for the family to try. Now I will admit, presentation wise hers looked WAYYY better than mine. It was a circular cake though and perfectly ice and decorated. Unusual for the usual tres leches but whatever. \n\nBefore we started eating SIL asked if someone could run to the kitchen and grab the cake cutter tool she bought at the store the other day. My husband volunteered since he was getting a refill of his wine anyway. \n\nHusband comes back in a minute later with his glass of wine, the cake cutting tool and a receipt that had 1 large tres leches cake, and a cake cutter tool purchased from our local bakery earlier this morning. \n\nHe questions my SIL about this jokingly, SIL loses her marbles are starts yelling at him as to why he was \"going through her stuff\". My husband explained that the cake cutter tool was inside her plastic grocery bag, and right under it was a receipt, so he grabbed it by accident with the tool and looked at it not thinking anything and lo and behold...\n\nMy FIL and I started laughing a little bit. BIL (not SIL's husband, my other BIL 22M) chimes in and is all like \"so much for homemade tres leches from scratch huh?\". Now this whole time I'm sitting there silently, because wtf am I supposed to say?\n\nAll of a sudden SIL starts going off on me saying how I tried to \"outshine\" her by making mine from scratch.\n\nI'm like ?? huh, I thought that was the whole point of this and also yours looks way better than mine so how did I outshine you?\n\nShe starts going off about how she's pregnant and the least I could've done was let her win.\n\nShe storms out and had been bad mouthing my husband and I ever since. I feel bad because it was supposed to be a fun, light hearted little competition. Most of the family is split because some feel like I could've given her a heads up.", "created_utc": 1677782314, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ga87a/aita_for_not_letting_my_pregnant_sil_win_a/", "score": 226, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

First off, you did nothing wrong. You just sat there as this all unfolded so I can't see how you're at fault at all.\n\nSecondly, your SIL cheated and got caught. Instead of admitting fault she threw a hissy fit and tried to defend her actions by claiming her pregnancy should absolve her of her bad behavior. Hopefully, her tantrum is the result of pregnancy hormones and an apology will be on the way.\n\nIf not, let her continue to sulk and don't apologize. She's rightfully embarrassed and needs to just take her lumps instead of lashing out like a toddler.", "She tried to cheat in a fun, light hearted little competition. That's crazy. That's like committing hard fouls on an eight-year-old to win a game of driveway basketball.\n\nNTA. SIL messed up bad here.", "NTA. This is pretty funny. I'm not sure what she thought you were supposed to do about her cheating. So, did yours taste better than the bakery cake?", "NTA - She's just mad she got caught trying to pass her store bought cake as homemade and is trying to deflect and make it look like you're the problem. You're not, and if she really didn't want to participate in the bake off, she could have politely declined.", ">\".... Most of the family is split because some feel like I could've given her a heads up....\"\n\nheads up for what? I'm really struggling to understand how family would think that anyone did anything wrong except your SIL. Your husband found the receipt in a perfectly innocent way. Why is she accusing you of \"not letting her win\". You didn't find the receipt.\n\nI don't understand how any of this is lying at your feet. You showed up with a homemade cake, that is all you did. Yet somehow family thinks you did something wrong? NTA, but I'm wondering if some of your family are AHs.", "A head\u2019s up to what? The fact that you didn\u2019t intend to cheat?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. She fucked around and found out lol.", "Give her a heads up that you weren\u2019t going to buy a cake for a homemade cake challenge??? NTA", "NTA. She wasn't confident enough in her cake to think it would beat yours and she tries to cheat and got caught. \n\nHer being pregnant doesn't change a thing.", "NTA - she's not mad she lost, she's mad she got caught", "Lol NTA and a tres leches should soak in all those leches not be a frosted cake like a birthday cake. So even without tasting you beat the bakery too!", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m confused. Given her a heads up about what? The fact that you were actually going to do exactly what you both agreed to do?", "NTA nobody even lost? I'm so confused you didn't even say anything! I also think its pregnancy hormones and maybe a little grace would help. She needs to apologize don't get me wrong but like accepting the apology if she ever does give it would be right?", "NTA, sounds like she didn\u2019t like being caught in a silly lie and took out her embarrassment on you. Granted your hubby could\u2019ve spoken to her jokingly in private, and not around everyone but I mean it\u2019s just cake.", "NTA. It was a contest to see whose HOMEMADE cake was better, she cheated, therefore losing by default. Period. And on top of that why would she keep the receipt showing her cheating? It\u2019s definitely not your fault that 1) she cheated, and 2) she was too dumb not to hide her cheating lol", "Given her a head's up about what? That cheating and lying for a no stakes family contest is weird and she shouldn't do it? Like what normal person would anticipate this? NTA.", "Girl got busted!  I'm cracking up!  I find it amusing when people deflect when they are caught red handed.  Pregnancy is never an excuse even though some try to make it so.\n\nI wish I could have tried your cake !\n\nNTA", "NTA what drugs was this woman on??\n\nShe's mad you made a cake to see who's was better? Sorry you made it yourself? Maybe the hormones are getting to her but the rest of the family is out of line. Sorry OP.", "INFO: what heads up could you have given? \n\nThis doesn't make any sense. Sure, she is miffed her fake homemade was found out, but how would you be AH? Hubby I can see (would disagree but could atleast see why maybe for going through the bag)", "NTA what kind of heads up should you have given her?  She cheated!  That's all on her!", "You're supposed to make your own cake not buy it, right? :D\n\nSIL took it way too seriously, cheated, took it too far in her reponses, and frankly, is way over the top with \"poor me, I'm pregnant!\" She's full of shit on all levels of this one. \n\nNTA, and deservedly so.", "NTA. It's just her embarrassment speaking. I had even forgotten that she was pregnant until you mentioned it again in the end.", "NTA - your SIL tried to cheat on a friendly family contest. Seems weird that she felt she needed to cheat or that winning was so important to her. Saying you should all \"let\" her win because of her condition seems odd as well, maybe have a quiet word with her on the side and see if she's OK? Maybe she's trying to bolster her self esteem because there's something not entirely peachy? This is entire speculation of course, but either way, you didn't do anything to shoot her in the foot, you have nothing to feel like TA for", "NTA. obviously \ud83d\ude02", "NTA, You never really \"won\" actually. She was just ashamed that she bought a cake instead of making it from scratch. She cheated and then she made a fuss to cover it up", "NTA. Your SIL cheated plain and simple and got upset when she was caught", "NTA! I love this story. I love tres leche cake. My FIL makes tres leche but uses cake mix (it's quicker) I love making cakes from scratch...I'm also pregnant. Maybe I need to have a tres leche cake bake off too!", "SIL embarrassed herself. NTA", "NTA pregnancy doesn\u2019t give your a right to cheat and win. It also doesn\u2019t give you a right to bad mouth someone for calling you out on your lies.", "NTA!! Omg this is hilarious!!!!!! Busted!", "NTA, she cheated and got caught, her being pregnant is completely irrelevant in this situation, you shouldn't have to downplay your efforts just to make her feel better.", "NTA. You both agreed to make yours to bring ahead of time. Why would you need to give her a heads up that you were doing what you had both agreed to? WTF is wrong with your family?\n\nHer being pregnant doesn\u2019t give her some magical \u201cwin every contest\u201d right.", ">We both like to brag about our HOMEMADE tres leches cakes. \n \n\nNta\n\nSo either way you win cause your was homemade... Her was store bought..\n\nSo if she has been buying store bought this whole time she should be bragging about anything. Doesn't matter if she's pregnant or not.\n\n\nAnd those were saying that your husband is because he let her cat out of the bag no he's just trying to make sure it was fair.", "NTA\n\nI hear that pregnancy hormones can be pretty wild, but boy did she lose it over something super silly. I don't know when, but there will be a point in the future where she's in the right head space, and be very ashamed by how she acted.\n\nHopefully, she apologizes when/if she comes to her senses.", "NTA!  She wanted a heads up that you you made your case from scratch when that was the whole point?  That's just radicicols!  If she's pregnant, perhaps her emotions got the best of her....", "NTA.", "NTA. You had no obligation to let her win for any reason, least of all her being pregnant. Also, she is a cheater and got caught. That\u2019s on her, not anyone else.", "NTA. On the bright side, there should be no more talk about whose tres leches cake is the best. You win, hands down!", "Your SIL got caught cheating. That's on her. Is that what she's going to teach her child? You're not responsible for her morals or lack thereof. NTA", "NTA. Seriously, this sounds like the behavior of a child. I would be a bit miffed that she tried to pass of this cake as her own! I don't even understand what pregnancy has to do with this. She didn't have to agree to the bake off in the first place!", "NTA for making a homemade tres leches cake rather than cheating like the SIL did and buying one from a store.\n\nMild Y-T-A for making me crave tres leches. lol", "What is the point of a bake off if you don\u2019t bake?? NTA and she is a bit crazy for taking it so seriously that she bought a cake", "NTA I think SiL should keep her hormones under control", "NTA, waste of a post, the outcome is 100% clear.", "You - NTA\n\n  \nYour husband - soft Y T A because he COULD just have pocketed the receipt and shown it to you in private.   \n\n\nYour SIL - big Y T A, not  even so much for buying a store-made cake to \"win\" a contest as for the whole \"You showed me up!\" thing when she was found out. Buying the cake to \"win\" the contest is just silly - it's a friendly game, no prizes. no real winners, and I bet once you were eating it, it would have been perfectly obvious hers was homemade and hers wasn't.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
