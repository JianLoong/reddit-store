SIL and I both consider ourselves pretty good cooks and usually always share the responsibility of making the food for family dinners or lunches when we all get together, since it's something we both enjoy. \n\nWe both like to brag about our HOMEMADE tres leches cakes. We always have friendly banter with each other about how \"mine would kick yours ass\", \"mine would put your to shame\" etc. This is 100% in a joking way and how we joke around with each other, SIL and I had a great relationship with each other. Or so I thought.\n\nSo we decided we were going to actually see who's cake tasted better at a recent family dinner that we had. We BOTH agreed before hand that it would just be for jokes and there would be no hard feeling's (obviously because it's just a cake). Boy was I wrong.\n\nFast forward we finish dinner and it's dessert time. SIL and I bring out our cakes for the family to try. Now I will admit, presentation wise hers looked WAYYY better than mine. It was a circular cake though and perfectly ice and decorated. Unusual for the usual tres leches but whatever. \n\nBefore we started eating SIL asked if someone could run to the kitchen and grab the cake cutter tool she bought at the store the other day. My husband volunteered since he was getting a refill of his wine anyway. \n\nHusband comes back in a minute later with his glass of wine, the cake cutting tool and a receipt that had 1 large tres leches cake, and a cake cutter tool purchased from our local bakery earlier this morning. \n\nHe questions my SIL about this jokingly, SIL loses her marbles are starts yelling at him as to why he was \"going through her stuff\". My husband explained that the cake cutter tool was inside her plastic grocery bag, and right under it was a receipt, so he grabbed it by accident with the tool and looked at it not thinking anything and lo and behold...\n\nMy FIL and I started laughing a little bit. BIL (not SIL's husband, my other BIL 22M) chimes in and is all like \"so much for homemade tres leches from scratch huh?\". Now this whole time I'm sitting there silently, because wtf am I supposed to say?\n\nAll of a sudden SIL starts going off on me saying how I tried to \"outshine\" her by making mine from scratch.\n\nI'm like ?? huh, I thought that was the whole point of this and also yours looks way better than mine so how did I outshine you?\n\nShe starts going off about how she's pregnant and the least I could've done was let her win.\n\nShe storms out and had been bad mouthing my husband and I ever since. I feel bad because it was supposed to be a fun, light hearted little competition.
