It's astounding you need to hide food for your child and now listen to their comments.  I hope their move-in date is sooner than later, if not, have a family meeting. You are the one compromised, not them.", "NTA.  Keep your baby's food out of reach. Do have a convo with Bil and Sil to not make comparisons on the eating habits of the children as that will build in your neice esentment of your baby.", "NTA but they are definitely causing that by outwardly comparing her to the baby and saying the baby is better than her in any way. It\u2019s not helpful to her self esteem which is budding right now", "INFO: Why is the family telling the niece that the baby is getting better food than her?", "I assume you pay for your child's food as you state the SIL doesn't replace it when her child eats it.\n\nYou have every right to keep it out of reach from the 6 yr old.\n\nNTA", "NTA it\u2019s your child\u2019s food.  SIL can and should buy her daughter her own food.", "NTA\n\nIt's not your responsibility to feed your niece and if your SIL wants her daughter to have similar food, she needs to be buying it.", "Buy a lock box for the babies room and keep the stuff there", "She's only 6 - it's easy to over-estimate a child's maturity when you have a baby but in all likelihood, she probably enjoys the baby food, whether because of the taste, the packaging or whatever else. Kids will be kids. Why not suggest her parents buy her toddler food? There's no harm, that stuff is relatively healthy and if she's a small eater, it's better than nothing. If she gets her own, the novelty will eventually wear off. \n\nThe issue is your SIL not replenishing the food, which is inconsiderate.", "Nta", "NTA, but I feel terrible for your niece. She shouldn\u2019t be shamed. It\u2019s going to cause resentments with her cousin and possibly cause further issues with food for her down the road. As others have said, talk to your BIL and SIL about adjusting their tactics regarding their daughter\u2019s diet. But as far as the food goes; you need to make sure YOUR child has the nutrition they need. And most baby food is not cheap. I would keep it hidden or locked away until they move out.", "Did you ask your SIL to buy more? Have a convo with her, so it makes sense to her to buy the same snacks - this is what her daugther eats, and she needs the nourishment.", "NTA. They are living with you so they should respect your child and your boundaries.  I would hide anything that is for your baby and then when they ask where that food came from and is there more for niece, just say it is the last one.  Or simply say no and let them know how to buy them for her themselves at the grocery store.  Seriously make this THEIR problem and be completely unhelpful about it since that is how they are treating you\n\nIf they are building their own house, they have money for their own groceries, but taking advantage of you is easier.  Make it the harder option, and if your niece has a temper tantrum, just leave.\n\nWhat is with people stealing baby food, anyway?  The baby literally can\u2019t eat anything else, so why on earth steal that food when there is other food in the house?  Would your sil allow you to do this to her if the situation was reversed?  No.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how people can move in with someone, which means you are doing them a huge favor, and then be such entitled aholes the whole time.  Make taking your BABY\u2019S FOOD a louder and bigger problem than your niece makes NOT getting that food.\n\nThey are literally stealing food from a baby, so of course NTA, but what is tarnation is wrong with these people?", "NTA\n\nBaby food is expensive. Keep his food hidden.", "NTA! Baby food is EXPENSIVE, and that\u2019s saying something when most food is expensive nowadays!", "NTA. You don't have to feed your niece at the expense of your own child, especially when your niece's parents won't compensate you for it.", "NTA", "NTA", "You\u2019re definitely NTA but I\u2019d like to mention something about your niece\u2019s diet. This diet causes anemia to a dangerous degree.  My son had to have two blood transfusions at the age of two due to this. It was a combination of factors including a doctor that didn\u2019t listen, a great grandfather giving my son milk because he didn\u2019t want him to be hungry and a kid who despised food. (Now he\u2019s a 5\u201911 bottomless pit lol). Dairy inhibits the absorption of iron and it doesn\u2019t sound like your niece is getting iron any other way.  She absolutely needs a checkup and blood work done. Switching her to oat milk may help, too.  It tastes just like the milk left after a bowl of cereal and has a lot more nutrients than dairy milk.  My son has a cup of chocolate oat milk every morning for breakfast and it keeps him full until lunch.", "NTA. I assume you are paying for this food for your child. Your SIL/BIL should be paying for food for THEIR child. If their child wants to eat baby food, they can buy it for her.\n\nHide your baby's food, this kid is literally taking food out of your baby's mouth!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
