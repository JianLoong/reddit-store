I do think that was inappropriate in spite of the fact that the dress was really a prom dress that you've worn multiple times.  Presumably when Ciara attended your wedding she was photographed with you in that dress.  Now you're going to show up in HER wedding photos in your wedding dress so it's understandable that she got so upset.

And not being rich doesn\u2019t mean not being able to afford a decent dress that\u2019s suitable for special occasions. It also doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2018d wear a new dress once and then never again since you keep using your wedding dress for fancy events. So a new dress does seem like a good investment. You wouldn\u2019t be in the same dress on every special occasion and people wouldn\u2019t recognize it as your wedding dress. Not to mention that nowadays you can get beautiful robes and party dresses for cheap. If you\u2018d put a dollar away everyday for two months you could already afford a good option.

Yes, you wore this dress for your wedding ceremony but you admitted it\u2019s your only nice dress, you wore it because you couldn\u2019t afford a traditional dress at the time, and you wear it to all your fancy events since you got it in high school. Your friend knew this before she set her wedding theme and attire requirements. If she wanted you to wear something else, she should have either asked you, bought you something, or picked a different color/style. The dress is very nice but I can believe there were fancier dresses at the party. Dark blue formal is a standard in the gown/dress world and guests can easily go all out for not too much money if they wanted to without you drawing attention to your dress.

I really don't think you did anything wrong here. The only thing could be that you actually look good in your dress, whereas she is a frumpy little number.

But still.", "It shouldn't look like the bride's dress and this one didn't \n\nNTA", "NTA. The most important thing is that it doesn't look like a wedding dress. On top of that, it's not really a wedding dress at all. \n\nThis was just a fancy dress you owned. You didn't even want to spend money on a new dress for your own wedding. Why on earth would you spend money on a new dress for someone else's wedding, especially when your dress fit the dress code so well.\n\nIdk why she responded like that. You wore it before and after, it wasn't white, there was zero reason for her to flip.\n\nBest case she was super stressed and overwhelmed about something else and your dress was the first thing she could find to latch on to.

OP has a tight budget & her so-called friend Ciara is the AH. \n\nCiara just had to ruin her friendship, she knew OP well enough to know that OP's dress was worn to the prom, also did duty as wedding dress, duty as formal attire for other weddings as a guest.

She looked lovely at my wedding and I never felt like she tried to upstage me or was in any kind of competition. That was simply the nicest dress she owned. Later on, she gave it to me.

The fact that groom stuck up for her makes me think the bride is jealous, this has come up before between them,  and she wanted to embarrass her at her wedding.", "Yeah this was my exact thought", "Does OP want to mend things? It almost sounds like this friend was looking for someone to explode on and OP was it. I've met people like that before and frankly, I don't enjoy being their mental punching bag. It's exhausting and not worth the aggravation.", "Also, knowing all that, she could have forced the issue a lot earlier by simply picking a different wedding colour.

EVEN with that it does NOT look like a wedding dress and in actuality it ISNT a wedding dress.  It\u2019s a formal dress that she just *happened* to wear to her wedding.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure when she wore it to prom first everyone didn\u2019t freak out thinking she wore a wedding dress to prom.  \n\nNot one sane person would look at this dress and think it\u2019s a wedding dress.", "Omg, this hadn't occurred to me earlier, but I'll bet you're right!", "I don't think the bride \"had license\", I just think this should be easy to suck up if an apology arrives. You can't have \"cut em off\" left on the table all the time.", "You do you but that strikes me as super prickly behaviour.", "Sorry to hear you had a similar experience. I wouldn\u2019t wish that toxicity on anyone.", "My solution wasn't to cut her off. It was for OP to decide if this is a person she wants in her life.  There has to be some accountability and to me sucking it up isn't the way I would go. I would have to feel that my friend actually meant it.  This was the bride completely humiliating her friend.

She\u2019s waiting for Christmas so she can ruin it one last time!  Plus it\u2019s also my husband\u2019s birthday so it\u2019s a two-fer.", "Lol, the trick is to be so confident in yourself that a baby's insults bounce off. From that position you can spot your real friends. If you're vulnerable to the random angry words of others, you don't have enough self respect.\n\nThe bride got upset for a stupid reason, this argument was stupid. Hopefully the bride will calm down but no harm has been done to OP except it ruined her day, which is a real shame."]}
