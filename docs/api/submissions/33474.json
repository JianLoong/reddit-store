Since the wedding, I wore it on a few occasions because it\u2019s basically the only one fancy dress I own.\n\n\nRecently, Ciara was getting married and I was obviously invited. The wedding color scheme was dark blue and she requested fancy attire, so I thought my dark blue dress would be fine. It\u2019s not white and it\u2019s not even remotely close to a wedding dress. I also didn\u2019t feel like wasting money on another fancy dress that I wouldn\u2019t ever wear again, especially since we aren\u2019t rich.\n\n\nSo I showed up at her wedding in my dark blue sequin dress.

However, when Ciara saw me, she lost it.\n\n\nShe yelled at me in front of all the guests, in front of her husband and my husband, saying that what I did was horrible and that no one shows up at a wedding in a wedding dress. I tried to reason with her, saying that the dress isn\u2019t a wedding dress, it\u2019s the only fancy piece of clothing I own, I wore it to multiple occasions before and after my wedding. She didn\u2019t listen and kept yelling at me to the point her bridesmaids and her husband started trying to calm her down. She also said a bunch of unsavoury names to me.\n\n\nI was very upset with the drama and decided to leave with my husband. Then I started getting texts from Ciara, who blamed me for upstaging her on her wedding day, for driving a wedge between her and her husband since he said that she overreacted massively and upset her friend over a dress.

It definitely speaks to the sort of person she is that she decided to blow up her wedding over it.

I do think that was inappropriate in spite of the fact that the dress was really a prom dress that you've worn multiple times.  Presumably when Ciara attended your wedding she was photographed with you in that dress.  Now you're going to show up in HER wedding photos in your wedding dress so it's understandable that she got so upset.

What do you think was under the meltdown? Have you guys had tension over stuff?", "You\u2018re not the asshole for wearing that dress. And not being rich doesn\u2019t mean not being able to afford a decent dress that\u2019s suitable for special occasions. It also doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2018d wear a new dress once and then never again since you keep using your wedding dress for fancy events. So a new dress does seem like a good investment. You wouldn\u2019t be in the same dress on every special occasion and people wouldn\u2019t recognize it as your wedding dress. Not to mention that nowadays you can get beautiful robes and party dresses for cheap. If you\u2018d put a dollar away everyday for two months you could already afford a good option.

Yes, you wore this dress for your wedding ceremony but you admitted it\u2019s your only nice dress, you wore it because you couldn\u2019t afford a traditional dress at the time, and you wear it to all your fancy events since you got it in high school. Your friend knew this before she set her wedding theme and attire requirements. If she wanted you to wear something else, she should have either asked you, bought you something, or picked a different color/style. The dress is very nice but I can believe there were fancier dresses at the party. Dark blue formal is a standard in the gown/dress world and guests can easily go all out for not too much money if they wanted to without you drawing attention to your dress.

You didn't outshine the bride, you didn't even try. She made you stand out. Because of her crazyness this dress and her temper tantrum will probably what people will remember from her wedding.", "NTA. Ciara needs to take some chill pills. I really don't think you did anything wrong here. The only thing could be that you actually look good in your dress, whereas she is a frumpy little number.

The only person who upstaged Ciara was Ciara.", "NTA!\n\nIf it's a known fact that you only have that one dress, and that you have worn it other times where she can see, then her not expecting you to use that particular dress for her own wedding is something she should have mentioned to you ahead of time.\n\nI will say you could have asked her if it was okay, and reminded her it's the only one you got. But still.", "It shouldn't look like the bride's dress and this one didn't \n\nNTA", "NTA. The most important thing is that it doesn't look like a wedding dress. On top of that, it's not really a wedding dress at all. \n\nThis was just a fancy dress you owned. You didn't even want to spend money on a new dress for your own wedding. Why on earth would you spend money on a new dress for someone else's wedding, especially when your dress fit the dress code so well.\n\nIdk why she responded like that. You wore it before and after, it wasn't white, there was zero reason for her to flip.\n\nBest case she was super stressed and overwhelmed about something else and your dress was the first thing she could find to latch on to.

Either way, no wonder there's now a wedge between her and her husband..", "Yes", "NTA, and just ignore her and don't let it bother you.  That in no way resembles a wedding dress.  And even if you had worn arrived in full white lace and taffeta regalia with a 50 foot train, the right thing for her to do would be to ignore it and act gracious and then everyone would be impressed with her and you would look like the ass.  Instead she acted like a five year old throwing a tantrum.  \n\nTake comfort in knowing that she ruined her own wedding.
