She's just going to lie to you about which stores she's stolen from to get you to take her places. And she's 100% going to steal stuff and get you in trouble because 14 year olds have the decision making skills of one of those squirrels that can't decide what side of the road it wants to be on (which is why both 14 year olds and squirrels can not drive).  If she complains about you not driving her, tell her she's welcome to complain to your parents and you'll be happy to explain your reasoning to them.", "NTA All you need is being charged with driving the getaway car!

She might continue stealing and it could lead to serious consequences.", "NTA - It's not worth it to get mixed up with her poor decisions especially because you are closer to 18 and would be going to jail rather than juvie if arrested.", "You could get arrested for being an accomplice. Absolutely don\u2019t drive her. NTA", "When I got my first car, I wouldn't do anything that would compromise my free use of that car. You should consider this same mindset. If your sister steals while you are with her, you will also get in trouble. Stop driving her places. Definitely NTA.", "Whoa. Very much NTA. Your sister has just felt some of the consequences to her actions: the employees know she's a thief and don't trust her, and now you know she's a thief and don't trust her either. You're absolutely within your rights to \\*not\\* want to be associated with a known thief.\n\n(I say this without judging the actual shoplifting.

My advice is to cut her off now before she gets YOU into trouble as well.", "NTA she\u2019s your sister and young but please please express to her how wrong this is. By taking her places you\u2019re encouraging/enabling her behavior AND it makes you look bad! You\u2019re not a thief, don\u2019t associate with thieves all it does is show people you\u2019re \u201cok\u201d with stealing even if you never steal anything yourself.

BTW, did you know that you an also be arrested if your sister steal from the store and you know about it? Aiding and abetting. Personally, I would have told her that you are leaving.

She could ruin your future.", "NTA. *When* she eventually gets caught, your parents may be pissed off that you knew and didn\u2019t tell them.

Your sister doesn't take into account that if she gets caught stealing something and they decide you're an accessory she will most likely be charged as a minor where you very well could be charged as an adult.

From that moment she was an in school friend only and I never socialised with after school from then on. Because it gets you a bad rep too, you can end up bring charged as an accomplice. You can end up with everything going wrong for you too. But that behaviour leaks into other things. She started bringing vodka into school, she failed all her exams. Her in uk you can still go to college at 16 to do courses that do retake and do pre courses to what you want to do. It's hard to get expelled but she managed it. She never got to do the career she wanted. It started with shop lifting and went down the pan from there. I also know 2 sisters who also started with shop lifting then lifting items from neighbours homes. Again that's how it started, but it ended with them both dead in their twenties. Do not drive her to stores and tell your parents.", "OP should tell their parents regardless and sooner rather than later. At 14 sis is probably too young to land in court but in a year or two that likely won't be the case, she is going to get in serious legal trouble that could screw up her future permanently.

As the mom of a 17 year old girl, this is insane to read. Sorry you have to live in such an environment, this is not normal.", "Thank you!"]}
