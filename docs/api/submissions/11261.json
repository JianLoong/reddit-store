She's just going to lie to you about which stores she's stolen from to get you to take her places. And she's 100% going to steal stuff and get you in trouble because 14 year olds have the decision making skills of one of those squirrels that can't decide what side of the road it wants to be on (which is why both 14 year olds and squirrels can not drive).  If she complains about you not driving her, tell her she's welcome to complain to your parents and you'll be happy to explain your reasoning to them.", "NTA All you need is being charged with driving the getaway car! How come your sister has no conscience?", "NTA \n\nThere's no reason for you to risk getting in trouble. If she wants to shoplift, she can get in trouble all on her own.", "NTA but I think you should tell your parents about this. She might continue stealing and it could lead to serious consequences.", "NTA - It's not worth it to get mixed up with her poor decisions especially because you are closer to the 18 and would be going to jail rather than juvie if arrested.", "You could get arrested for being an accomplice. Absolutely don\u2019t drive her. NTA", "When I got my first car, I wouldn't do anything that would compromise my free use of that car. You should consider this same mindset. If your sister steals while you are with her, you will also get in trouble. Stop driving her places. Definitely NTA.", "Whoa. Very much NTA. Your sister has just felt some of the consequences to her actions: the employees know she's a thief and don't trust her, and now you know she's a thief and don't trust her either. You're absolutely within your rights to \\*not\\* want to be associated with a known thief.\n\n(I say this without judging the actual shoplifting. But you deserve to have a say in what crimes you're associating yourself with!)", "NTA - she's going to get you in trouble with her criminal ways.", "NTA. You don\u2019t need to be the getaway driver for your teenage thief sister.", "NTA. She\u2019s probably hoping to sneak some more stuff too. My advice is to cut her off now before she gets YOU into trouble as well.", "NTA she\u2019s your sister and young but please please express to her how wrong this is. By taking her places you\u2019re encouraging/enabling her behavior AND it makes you look bad! You\u2019re not a thief, don\u2019t associate with thieves all it does is show people you\u2019re \u201cok\u201d with stealing even if you never steal anything yourself. I hope your sister wises up bc people talk, and being branded a thief is a hard one to clear. Good luck", "Nta.  You aren't worried about other people. You are worried about the repercussions you might face if she decides to get sticky fingers while out with you.", "NTA in any way.", "NTA your protecting yourself against likely being considered an accomplice if your sisters gets caught during one of your trips. I would bring it up with your parents if you sister starts acting out more or is giving you a hard time.", "NTA also, in most places, at 17 and with a new license you\u2019re not even allowed to be driving after 11 pm without an adult present unless you\u2019re coming home from a school or work event. Getting pulled over or a store calling the cops because your sister is a known their would be pretty bad for you", "Nta there\u2019s a old saying \u201cguilt by association \u201c let that sink in and do what you need to do to protect yourself.", "NTA\n\nYour sister is on a path to juvenile detention or jail.

BTW, did you know that you an also be arrested if your sister steal from the store and you know about it? Aiding and abetting. Personally, I would have told her that you are leaving. If she wants a ride home, she can leave with you now. BTW, NEVER take her to another store again. She could ruin your future.", "NTA. *When* she eventually gets caught, your parents may be pissed off that you knew and didn\u2019t tell them. But that\u2019s just something for you to think about.", "Yes, I like this!", "My parents have given her some astonishing leeway\ud83d\ude02  My mothers parenting toward her is pretty much, \u201cI cant control what she does.\u201d So I suppose her consequences will have to get bad enough before she decides that life isn\u2019t \u201cI do what I want and nothing else matters\u201d  Could be worse though!"]}
