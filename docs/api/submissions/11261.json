Your sister has just felt some of the consequences to her actions: the employees know she's a thief and don't trust her, and now you know she's a thief and don't trust her either.

BTW, did you know that you an also be arrested if your sister steal from the store and you know about it? Aiding and abetting. Personally, I would have told her that you are leaving.

She could ruin your future.", "NTA. *When* she eventually gets caught, your parents may be pissed off that you knew and didn\u2019t tell them.

Not worth a night in the tombs for you if things go way south.", "NTA and tell your parents.", "NTA one of my friends at school boasted how much shop lifting she was into. From that moment she was an in school friend only and I never socialised with after school from then on. Because it gets you a bad rep too, you can end up bring charged as an accomplice. You can end up with everything going wrong for you too. But that behaviour leaks into other things. She started bringing vodka into school, she failed all her exams. Her in uk you can still go to college at 16 to do courses that do retake and do pre courses to what you want to do. It's hard to get expelled but she managed it. She never got to do the career she wanted. It started with shop lifting and went down the pan from there. I also know 2 sisters who also started with shop lifting then lifting items from neighbours homes. Again that's how it started, but it ended with them both dead in their twenties. Do not drive her to stores and tell your parents.", "OP should tell their parents regardless and sooner rather than later.

Sorry you have to live in such an environment, this is not normal.", "Thank you!", "NTA your sister's actions have caused problems and while she doesn't mind, you're more adult and do not like guilt by association for something a) you didn't do and B) which she clearly has no remorse over. but should. If being watched as a consequence of her crimes doesn't bother her, not being driven around as a consequence of her crimes should.", "NTA.  Technically if she does it while you are with her you could get in trouble too, especially   after you turn 18. But I expect she will just start lying to you about if she robbed the local stores.  She probably has gotten everything within a reasonable radius of your house. I'd explain your potential liability to her. She probably understands what an \"adult record\" is by now.  If you get a criminal record, it will certainly impact your life from an employability perspective.", "NTA.

Growing up, my son, the younger one, was a well behaved, and couldn't lie worth a darn, still can't, stayed out of trouble.  My older child was a different story.  She (16/17 at the time) did what she wanted, spun lie after lie.  She (16 to 17 at the time) used to sleep over at her \" friend Nicole's house\" every week or so for over a year before we had an emergency and called Nicole's house and the girl's mother that my daughter hadn't slept over for several years.  She was at her boyfriends house for that whole period.  It didn't help the boyfriends parents knew she lied to us and didn't tell us.  Turned out they liked my daughter and they were pushing the kids to get married.  My daughter used to shoplift as well.  Talk about feeling like a failure.  I had a 4 year degree in psychology and my ex was getting her Ph.D in Developmental Psychology at the time.  Lol, we did parenting by the book.  The kids grew up great but they were still kids.

Extreme mental illness runs in the family unfortunately! I\u2019ve gotta fight real hard for a healthy mind.", "The car keys comment reminded me of something else.
