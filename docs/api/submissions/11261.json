From that moment she was an in school friend only and I never socialised with after school from then on. Because it gets you a bad rep too, you can end up bring charged as an accomplice. You can end up with everything going wrong for you too. But that behaviour leaks into other things. She started bringing vodka into school, she failed all her exams. Her in uk you can still go to college at 16 to do courses that do retake and do pre courses to what you want to do. It's hard to get expelled but she managed it. She never got to do the career she wanted. It started with shop lifting and went down the pan from there. I also know 2 sisters who also started with shop lifting then lifting items from neighbours homes. Again that's how it started, but it ended with them both dead in their twenties. Do not drive her to stores and tell your parents.", "OP should tell their parents regardless and sooner rather than later.

Technically if she does it while you are with her you could get in trouble too, especially   after you turn 18. But I expect she will just start lying to you about if she robbed the local stores.  She probably has gotten everything within a reasonable radius of your house. I'd explain your potential liability to her. She probably understands what an \"adult record\" is by now.

Growing up, my son, the younger one, was a well behaved, and couldn't lie worth a darn, still can't, stayed out of trouble.  My older child was a different story.  She (16/17 at the time) did what she wanted, spun lie after lie.  She (16 to 17 at the time) used to sleep over at her \" friend Nicole's house\" every week or so for over a year before we had an emergency and called Nicole's house and the girl's mother that my daughter hadn't slept over for several years.  She was at her boyfriends house for that whole period.  It didn't help the boyfriends parents knew she lied to us and didn't tell us.  Turned out they liked my daughter and they were pushing the kids to get married.  My daughter used to shoplift as well.  Talk about feeling like a failure.

You need to stop the theft.  You may want to have a conversation with your parents about her stealing.  Otherwise she's just going to keep doing it & think it's ok.  And as she gets older if she doesn't grow out of it, the theft will only be upgraded.", "I think your sister could be crying out for help. \n\nShe needs some good role models. You're one, because you're against stealing. Maybe you can help her find some more? Making a fake LInkedIn account is great for this - look up job titles you'd like to have and find people who have them (please steer her away from scammers/influencers/crypto/life coaches). \n\nShe should be enrolled in more positive activities. Music lessons? Volunteering? Maybe there's something you two can do together on the weekends that would be positive for her.\n\nShoplifting can sometimes be tied to eating disorders, so watch out for that. It can be a sign that your sister has anxiety and is trying to exert a sense of control. The self-compassion workbook by kristin neff can help with this - I think it's a good exercise for everyone, but it can help with anxiety too. If your childhood was tough, the book running on empty: overcoming your childhood emotional neglect can help too.", "NTA.
