Around the time of my son's first birthday I found out my kid's dad(29M) was cheating and left me. Since then, I've secured 2 jobs, 1 full time as a PR manager in healthcare and a night job at my son's daycare to get a $1200 monthly discount on daycare on top of getting my masters. I have a 3 bedroom apartment, my own vehicle, and have built a great support system of friends. His dad and I are surpringly getting along and while I don't agree with cheating, the separation has been beneficial for our family. \n\nMy family is very judgemental. They are always looking for things I'm doing wrong. For example, this week I got a bad throat infection. I asked my family to watch him for 2 hours to go to urgent care to get antibiotics. I pick up my son from daycare and head straight to my parents. Immediately my sister (26F) (childless) goes on about how dirty my son is, how unkempt his hair is, and how he's wearing no shoes (he threw them off in the car). I can't breathe, my airway is tight, and this is what I deal with EVERY SINGLE TIME, I Go over.\n\nI am starting to get anxiety attacks everytime I have to see them. I've decided because of the trauma from last year combined with my families constant judgement, I don't want to have a pay/plan my sons party. His dad and I agreed to take him to the aquarium for his birthday. \n\nMy family thinks I'm being an AH for depriving my son of a party. This is the same kid who I take to Disneyland nearly every weekend or to the zoo, parks, legoland etc. They asked to plan and throw a party for him and I don't have to go, but I just feel like it's rewarding their bad behavior. \n\nA lot of my friends have mixed feelings because they say my family should be able to do something for his birthday but I'll throw one next year. I'm just honestly exhausted and don't want to deal with their judgement anymore.\n\nTL/DR: overly judgy family wants to throw a party for my son. I don't want to reward their bad behavior but I could be depriving my son.", "created_utc": 1692298788, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15twchm/aita_for_not_allowing_my_family_to_throw_my_son_a/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

When their behavior towards you improves, they can continue contact with your nibbling. Until then, they will have to show that they can shape up.", "NTA - you have a great idea about the aquarium.  my son didn\u2019t have a birthday party until he was 4 and had friends from preschool and the neighborhood, and it was a little kids part.  For his second and third bdays, we took him to the zoo for one and the aquarium for the other.  He loved it.\n\nthe party is for them, not your son.  Don\u2019t do it.  You would be rewarding their bad behavior.  I would suggest finding a babysitter you can use rather than your family and disengaging with your family.  You need some mom friends where you can share emergency babysitting needs\u2026 maybe some of the moms of the daycare kids, you could establish a friendship with?", "NTA, set boundaries and let your family know they have to earn the right to see/celebrate YOUR son.", "NTA, it almost sounds like it's time to go low contact with them and also set some boundaries. If they are bashing you, then they don't need to see your son for any reason.", "NTA. This is a 2 year old! They're not having a party for him. He won't care.\n\nThey're having a party for themselves with your son as the excuse. They don't deserve a party. Good for you for saying no. Let them find a different excuse.\n\nThe less contact with these people, the better.", "NTA, youre doing amazing, honestly its insane how much you are doing. You should be proud to raise your son the way you are, your family is TA. Good job making boundaries, keep doing it, your family does not deserve to be close to your son.", "NTA I would start reducing the amount of time they spend with him all together. In a couple of more years the things they say will start having a serious impact on his self-esteem and his respect for you.", "Your family is abusing you then they want to be rewarded for their behavior? Seriously?\nYou did something good for yourself and maybe you should consider finding someone else to help, so you and your son could avoid all the abuse. You both deserve respect and kindness.\nNTA\n\nEdit: your son is only 2 and he doesn't understand parties yet. Next year or on his 4 birthday he will understand this is a special day and want something different.\nBut you're making all his other days special too, so he won't miss a day with some abusive people.", "NTA.  \nThey can DO something for his birthday without it being a party. They can make a little family dinner for him, or take him to a movie.", "The story sounds familiar", "NTA. Kid won't even remember this birthday, honestly. Wait until he gets older and can enjoy it more, then plan something on your own terms.", "NTA. A party for a two year old is actually a party for them. If your family is compounding on your stress then some time away from them is ideal. You need to recuperate and be the best version for your son, who is your only priority.", "I think you should let them have a party and go home and use some time to sleep and relax. If they are good grandparents/ aunts and treat him well\u2026. Let them have a little party even if you don\u2019t get along great with them. It doesn\u2019t even have to be on his bday. It just seems a little petty to alienate him from his family. Extended family is important. Light YTA", "NAH. Your son was dirty, and it's perfectly fine for your sister to bring that to your attention- especially when they are doing Free Babysitting. Maybe she's tired of bathing him every time you drop him off for free Babysitting. \n\n\nHow Main Character of you, to only want to use your Family for Free Babysitting, but become Angry when they bring up the cleanliness and  Well-being of the child. \n\nAlso, they get to Babysit for free, but are Not invited to the kid's birthday? \n\nAnd your sister isn't lacking anything. Your life seems like a Stressful mess, and she is Childfree and likely not a mess. I wouldn't be surprised if you envy her, and that's why you take benign truthful concerns she has and view them through a mean, judgy lens assuming and assigning the worst intentions from people who care about your son. \n\n\nYou are a piece of work.", "NTA but also you should let your family throw a party if they\u2019re offering.  It\u2019s about your son\u2019s family, even if they are often shitty to you, for which I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I don't remember any of it and apparently I was so completely exhausted at the end of the it, that I had a tantrum for hours.\n\nAfter that we jsyt did things as a family on birthdays instead of parties. A lot better, cheaper and we could do whatever we wanted", "NTA, and people like your family are dangerous for you to be around. People who will accuse you of child neglect, where there is none, just because they want to put you down for being a divorced woman or a single mom. This could escalate to fraudulent calls to child protective services. You need to find other arrangements for emergency babysitting, and cut ties with your family members who are hoping for your downfall.", "NTA- your family is judge mental. Being a parent is tough. You need support not criticism.", "Are you....my sister lmao\nShe's going to appreciate the comment", "Good grief- he\u2019s 2!  He won\u2019t remember a party!  Keep your plans intact and have fun.

You need to start placing your well being and mental health over their happiness", "NTA - I am so sorry they are treating you this way. They wanted to throw him a party but you don\u2019t have to go? And your friends say family deserve to do something for his birthday BUT that is only in the case they are mentally and emotionally helping both child and parent. Yours are not. They are not treating you like family should so why would you want to continue a relationship with them?! \n\nKeep sticking up for yourself and I wouldn\u2019t leave them alone with your child anytime soon. This is where they will try and get information from your child and work in brainwashing, your mom is mean huh. Does she ever wash you? No she doesn\u2019t wash you, you\u2019re dirty. DO NOT leave them alone with him unless absolutely necessary. Family is not always blood but those who help lift you up and support you and your child. They are not fsmily in my eyes.", "NTA. If your family can't respect you & everything you're doing for your son, then they don't get to be around him for anything.  You've been busting your butt at TWO jobs to provide for your little guy AND getting a master's degree on top - I stand in awe of your determination, you are amazing & an awesome mom. Stand firm with your family and have a wonderful day at the aquarium \u2763\ufe0f"]}
