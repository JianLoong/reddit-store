I have a coworker who I\u2019ve considered a friend for approximately 5 years. More than once she\u2019s asked me to trade after-hours shift with her because of some urgent situstuon that came up with her kids, such as her ex husband/the children\u2019s father making last minute plans that affect custody. So recently when she texted me that she needed \u201ca big favor\u201d and asked if I could cover another one of her shifts, naturally I assumed it had something to do with her kids, or maybe a marital issue with her new husband. I told her that I had plans of my own but I would scrap them if she couldn\u2019t find anyone else to cover for her. Ten minutes later she tells me she can\u2019t find anyone else (though she never sent out an email requesting coverage) and thanks me for covering because she really needs a girl\u2019s night out, she never gets them anymore.\nThis is my exact reply to her (minus her name): I agreed to cover for you because you said you needed a big favor. I thought maybe you needed the night off because it had to do with your kids or something. But I am canceling my own plans for a girls night out?\nHer reply to me: Wow.\nI rarely go out. Not that I need to explain that to you. But it is something that is important to me.\nIf you don\u2019t want to cover anymore, let me know. I will email out and switch it back.\nMy reply to her: Wow is how I\u2019m feeling. I told you I had plans but would cover for you if no one else could. Maybe 10 mins later (if that?) you replied back stating so far no one could cover for you. Yet I didn\u2019t see an email to everyone asking to trade or cover. But I thought never mind, it\u2019s probably something to do with her kids since she said she needs a big favor. So ok, I\u2019ll cancel my plans to help out. But tbh if you had told me it was for a girls night out from the start, I wouldn\u2019t have canceled my own plans for that. And fyi, I\u2019m not at all judging you for wanting to go out. It just feels disrespectful that you didn\u2019t make more of an effort to find someone else when I told you I had plans. But no, u don\u2019t need to find someone else to cover. Hopefully y\u2019all have fun, I\u2019m sure u need it.\nHer reply to me: I did make an effort and no thank you\nI will have (someone else) cover.\nMy final reply to her: So now somehow you\u2019re upset with me about this?\nHer final reply to me (then crickets ever since): I will continue this conversation in person and when Im not upset.\n\nSo\u2026 AITA?", "created_utc": 1696647106, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/171vgor/aita_for_not_scrapping_my_plans_to_cover_an/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She saw you as the easy button and pushed it.", "NTA - Your coworker clearly took advantage of your willingness to help in an emergency by misleading you. You are absolutely within your right to turn down the offer once the true nature of her request was revealed. She is being incredibly childish about the whole thing by not taking accountability and playing the victim. Don't give in to her and don't allow her to manipulate you any further.", "NTA.  Asking you to cover her shift so she can go have a fun night out isn't nice.  She should have asked if you had plans and been upfront about the reason she wanted you to cover for her so you could make an informed choice.  Instead she let you assume that she had an actual need for someone to cover for her instead of just wanting to go have fun.  What an asshole.", "NTA. She is projecting her responsibility for the issue onto you", "NTA.\n\nYou're not obligated to cover anyone's shift. She also twisted the knife by her initial response, Maybe she could've asked for help covering it, or explained herself first, *or* realize it's not anyone's responsibility but hers to cover. Instead of saying 'wow' and guilt tripping you immediately.", "NTA.  Please stop covering shifts for her.  You are now her automatic default and it looks like she just expects it to be you.  We all need a break but her plans to go out shouldn't trump the plans you already made.  Also, now that you told her you would only help when it's related to her kids she will not be honest when asking you to cover a shift for her.  Your kindness is being taken advantage of and she needs to find other ways to deal with situations related to her children.", "Nta I think you need to let it go. Don't cover for her because she feels her life is more important than yours.", "I find it interesting that she can find someone else to cover her shift now that she\u2019s offended when before nobody could cover it. She just didn\u2019t check. NTA. Sounds like you were honest with her about your feelings on the matter and not rude to her.", "NTA. Why are her plans more important than yours? She's not entitled to you covering her shift.", "Well now she prob won\u2019t be asking you anymore", "TL:DR.

Thank you for helping me put it into words", "Definitely not. She seems to be taking the high and mighty approach, as if she\u2019s above me now and won\u2019t lower herself to talk to me\u2026 I mean she still talks to me about work stuff but no more friendly conversations.", "Do not back down to her manipulation.  Her \" we will talk about this in person and when I am not upset\" is manipulation and gaslighting.  Trying to make you feel like you are in the wrong for upsetting the queen.  Do not fall for this.", "Doodums her.  She is already using you when her and her ex have problems.   Hopefully you have had or will have a great time.", "Yep, she is already setting the stage to play the victim.  The uno reverse card here is that as soon as she starts, just say you are still hurt that she tried to take advantage of you and aren't ready to accept her apology.  Exit, stage left.", "Well we were/are friends, so I don\u2019t consider it using me if she\u2019s straight up about why she\u2019d asking me to cover for her. Because friends do each other favors. Just like she would sometimes sober drive for me. It was just this time how she misrepresented the situation, and then acted like somehow I was at fault for it. It\u2019s really good to know that other people see my perspective and I\u2019m not crazy", "Definitely seeing you.  Speaking as someone who got rid of a succubus friend a few years ago.   The relief. I would tense up when her name showed on my phone. \nSo she drove a couple of times.   has she  put herself out for you other times. .  And if she has, how many times has she reminded you of what she did."]}
