You didn't agree, you didn't give them permission to add your name to the gift, you already had a gift for her, and even if it was just $5 they don't have the right to sign you up for stuff like that without your say-so. Where do they expect you to get money like that? They are the AHs.\n\nEdited to add: tell your mom they signed your name to the gift wothout your permission and that you can't take credit for it. There might be some drama but you need to get this out in the open.", "NTA.  I want to know what person believes that a 13 year old has $200 to contribute to a gift.  Is this even real?  It's so absurd of an expectation for someone that age that it's hard to believe it actually happened.  At any rate, your sisters are being unreasonable to expect you to contribute that much, and especially since they didn't ask you if you wanted to go in on a gift together.", "NTA.

You dont owe anything and that is their fault for this. \n\n1. Id ask for the receipt to see how much it was. \n2.
