Seems nobody else is talking about that side of things, so let me list all the ways you're being taken for a ride. You're NTA, before I forget.\n\nFirst off - implants are the premium choice. He can get by just fine with a partial denture or bridges. Implants are a grand or two EACH and are usually NOT covered by insurance. Secondly, even if you DID donate and he DID get implants done, he'd have wasted your money. You can NOT smoke to the degree Terry does when you have implants - it eats the bone away that holds the implant in. Shoot, just throw your money in the wind. Third, there's no fucking way any doctor in his right mind would see Terry's oral health and think, yea let's put some hardware in there that requires meticulous cleaning. I bet that fella's got a calculus bridge yellower than the yellow brick road.\n\nA partial would be your best option because you can pull teeth and add a tooth onto the partial as it goes. Implants take at least 8 months to heal before you can even add the chewing component (crown) onto it, and that bad boy won't last under such poor conditions; his body will spit them out because he can't take care of them.\n\nA denture with medicaid is roughly 800$ covered - a partial is worth maybe 3/400, coverage depending. Most insurances I've seen can accept and help pay for these even if not medicaid. Don't donate and let your family members know they're scamming you folks. He's using your good will to finance a premium option not covered by insurance that doesn't even make sense to have.", "NTA.  She judged you and she doesn\u2019t know shit about you.

Mostly from stress and impact. On average a runner has thicker leg bones than a cyclist for example.\n\nYour jaw bones maintain their mass through use. Your teeth pressing on your jaw every time you bite encourages development of bone mass through repeated stress. \n\nDentures don't provide enough impact to do this so people with false teeth end up with shrunken jaws.\n\nIf you have a lot of teeth extracted in one area you can expect to lose substantial bone mass locally. The major benefits of implants is that just like real teeth they stop your jaw from withering away.\n\nOnce bone loss reaches a certain point it becomes largely irreversible and you're stuck that way. It permanently affects your appearance and makes you prone to injuries. It can also cause pain from a weakened mouth and emotional damage from facial disfigurement. \n\nAny fall or hit could mean major surgery. There's also a chance it won't heal well which would make things even worse.\n\nIf you've ever seen someone with a full set of dentures without their teeth in, you know that pucker - faced look that they have? That's from missing bone mass more than it is from missing teeth.", "How do you know his insurance coverage?", "Ah, good point.

Smoking would only worsen the bone loss and creates a lot of problems in the mouth vis a vis dryness and other issues. He would at least have to quit for 90 days before the surgery as mentioned elsewhere. I just wanted to point out that dentures though better than having no teeth, are not a complete solution to the problems caused by tooth loss.\n\nOne of my closest friends is predisposed to dental issues (everyone in his family has problems with their teeth) and recently had to have most of his lower jaw done via implants. I did donate to his gofundme but he wasn't pushy and was mostly just overwhelmed with gratitude towards everyone that pitched in. I learned a lot about the issue through watching him go through it.\n\nHe used to smoke and had to quit prior to the procedure. For about 3 months after surgery he still couldn't really hit a joint or steal a drag from someone without it bothering him. He said it made his mouth very uncomfortable. So now not only does he look better and feel more confident with a visibly fuller face but he's smoke-free. Wins all around!", "If you spend the money on insurance that would be spent on Pepsi and smokes, it's enough for pretty good insurance - the sheer amount of money involved in drinking and smoking that much!"]}
