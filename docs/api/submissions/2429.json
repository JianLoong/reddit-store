Seems nobody else is talking about that side of things, so let me list all the ways you're being taken for a ride. You're NTA, before I forget.\n\nFirst off - implants are the premium choice. He can get by just fine with a partial denture or bridges. Implants are a grand or two EACH and are usually NOT covered by insurance. Secondly, even if you DID donate and he DID get implants done, he'd have wasted your money. You can NOT smoke to the degree Terry does when you have implants - it eats the bone away that holds the implant in. Shoot, just throw your money in the wind. Third, there's no fucking way any doctor in his right mind would see Terry's oral health and think, yea let's put some hardware in there that requires meticulous cleaning. I bet that fella's got a calculus bridge yellower than the yellow brick road.\n\nA partial would be your best option because you can pull teeth and add a tooth onto the partial as it goes. Implants take at least 8 months to heal before you can even add the chewing component (crown) onto it, and that bad boy won't last under such poor conditions; his body will spit them out because he can't take care of them.\n\nA denture with medicaid is roughly 800$ covered - a partial is worth maybe 3/400, coverage depending. Most insurances I've seen can accept and help pay for these even if not medicaid. Don't donate and let your family members know they're scamming you folks. He's using your good will to finance a premium option not covered by insurance that doesn't even make sense to have.", "NTA.  She judged you and she doesn\u2019t know shit about you.  You are never required to explain your finances or make donations.  No is no.  your parents should explain how her behavior is garbage and needs to learn manners. \n\nIt\u2019s almost as if everything she said, should be directed at her behavior.", "ESH, she shouldn't be pestering you but it's a uniquely young person's perspective that so long as someone doesn't do everything perfectly they deserve to suffer.", "NTA, Sue can sign up for Carecredit \ud83d\udc9a", "NTA! What\u2019s to say Terry is going to change his actions after getting dental implants???? Once he understands the true consequences of his actions maybe he\u2019ll be motivated to change. Until then you\u2019d be enabling his actions by \u201cdonating\u201d to his fund, only for him to continue his unhealthy behaviors", "Friendly reminder that OPs frontal lobe hasn\u2019t even fully developed yet. She may not be perfect but is definitely trying to navigate difficult situations while being in college. \nSue and Terry on the other hand DO have developed frontal lobes - which are in charge of judgement, decision making, safety awareness, planning, etc. \nso yeah fuck all the terrys and sues out there who enable each other and then cry when others won\u2019t cater to their BS", "Nta, tell her to buy a blender and have him drink Pepsi smoothies", "NTA.
