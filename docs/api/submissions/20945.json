I'd be upset if my husband cut my kids hair without telling me first, I can't imagine how pissed I'd be if they came home from a playdate like that.

If my three year old wanted blue hair, I\u2019d help them safely get it. It is INSANE to me that anyone would give a shit. \n\nThat being said, especially when a kid isn\u2019t late teens, I am NOT THEIR PARENT. We can debate whether or not it\u2019s morally acceptable for a parent to control their child\u2019s hair. I personally do not think it is. But A LOT OF FUCKING PEOPLE don\u2019t see it that way. Wrong or right, MOST people would read it as a MASSIVE overreach to mess with a child\u2019s hair without their parents\u2019 permission. \n\nSo personally? Genuinely don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole. Anyone should feel free to do whatever they want with their hair, ESPECIALLY when they\u2019re underage and not in a job market and are pretty much free, because a public school can\u2019t kick you out, at least. \n\nBut most people will see it as an overstep, as \u201cinterfering with their parenting\u201d. I think any child should be able to have that small amount of control over their own presentation. I would also let my kids do a lot of things other parents wouldn\u2019t allow (For example, I would NEVER raise a hand to my child, but I ABSOLUTELY will let them touch something hot or fall off of a skateboard trying something I\u2019ve tried telling them they aren\u2019t ready for, natural consequences type things), but won\u2019t allow certain things other parents would (my children will NOT have unsupervised screen time, only approved shows/games until they\u2019re middle/high school aged and I can relatively trust their judgement). I\u2019d let my kid have a half shaved head with their remaining hair neon green at age six, but I wouldn\u2019t let them have unsupervised internet time. And that\u2019s my standards as a parent. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with someone else\u2019s parental standards. At the same time, if the kid isn\u2019t being abused physically or emotionally, you have no right to undermine other parents. Legally, even if the abuse is emotional, and sometimes even physical, you don\u2019t have a right/a place to intervene. That\u2019s hard for me personally.

Just because YOU don\u2019t think he needed permission doesn\u2019t give you the right to make parental decisions for him.  YTA.", "Yes he did. \n\nA 12 year old always needs permission.\n\nAnd so did you.", "Not every parent has the same rules for their kids as you do for yours. Obviously, he did need permission. So did you, and you should have asked his parents before making such a big change to this KIDS hair.", "He is still a fairly young minor, so kind of does.", "That\u2019s not your decision to make you\u2019re not his parent", "In most countries 18 is the age of consent\u2026 before that, the parents has to give consent, and the child can assent. This means they can agree or disagree. But the parent still holds consent. Look it up\u2026 it\u2019s an interesting distinction.", "He may not have needed permission but you did to touch their child and you didn\u2019t have it", "That's not your call. Why even post of you don't want an outside perspective?", "You did. YTA", "What is the legal age to get a haircut on your own?   Oh wait, it's a judgment call UP TO EACH FAMILY. \n\nHe's a minor, and he's not your kid.  You overstepped.", "He's 12. How is that hard for you to understand", "Maybe the problem is you gave him a cheapskate hairstyle? My kids can absolutely choose their hairstyles, but some overstepping nut job with a pair of clippers isn\u2019t going to be the one to do it. They go to a salon/barber. \n\nYou\u2019re lucky you haven\u2019t had a visit from police (because cutting a child\u2019s hair without their parents permission is assault in a lot of places), or had a demand letter for payment for having the dodgy \u2018hair style\u2019 fixed by barber. \n\nStay in your lane. Don\u2019t make decisions for other peoples children.", "You are delusional", "Perhaps it was an impulsive thing, to be like your son but he's been growing it for ages and is now very disappointed. That's why you let his guardians make the choice or give it to him. My ex did this with our son and he's never had a cut since and has real issue. Well done for potentially scaring the young guy", "Says who? You?  You\u2019re still TA, lol", "BUT HE DID?! He\u2019s a minor! You\u2019re not his barber or hairdresser, you\u2019re *HIS FRIENDS MOTHER*, you can\u2019t just buzz and dye a KID\u2019S hair because you feel like it?!", "If I was his parents I\u2019d consider looking into pressing charges, just to teach you a lesson. He\u2019s a child and not yours. You overstepped big time!", "Yes he did. You don\u2019t get to decide whether he needs permission or not, he didn\u2019t come out of your body.", "He\u2019s a minor", "You realize you've just made it to where he'll never be allowed to come over again, right?", "HE\u2019S NOT YOUR KID! You don\u2019t get to decide what he needs permission for.", "HE didn't need permission. YOU did.", "You did though. He is a minor. You needed permission from his parents. Depending on where you live, the parents can charge you for assault. He's 12. You had no right to act like his parents. Also, who the hell let's a child put hair color I'm when it's not their kid? Do you know if he has allergies? People can have some dangerous reactions to hair dye. Everything from the sprays to the permanent. They can literally kill you. What you did was irresponsible and possibly illegal. You need to apologize to the parents and hope like hell they can't charge you with a felony where you live.", "Oh?  He walked to the store without you knowing and bought it with his own money, then came back and colored it entirely without you?  No?  Fucking thought not.  YTA", "That i assume you provided and gave access to while you were supervising him. It is still on you.", "You at the very least enabled it. And secondly, it sounds like you're the one who actually added the color so yeah, you did change his hair color. Doesn't matter if he asked for it.", "Where did he get the colour?  You didn't see the colour the whole time it was on his head.  ?\nI haven't seen this asked,.  .. but what would you do if your child came home with a changed appearance?   An earring, or eyebrow piercing, because hey he's 12 and doesn't need permission.", "Take some responsibility for your actions, instead of blaming a 12 yo", "So he came to your house with dye already in his backpack?", "YTA, especially because this is going to impact how much time Aaron gets to spend with your son going forward. You are old enough to know you should ask before cutting someone else\u2019s kids hair. Not your place.", "Or get any in his eyes. Can't imagine that'd go over well", "Of course they can. But I wouldn\u2019t do it unless I checked with the parents first.  Even if he asked me. How hard is it? \u201cSure mate, just check with your mom first\u201d.", "Legally, by someone else, nope. They also can't get their hair dyed, which OP also did. OP seriously overstepped. ETA: all this is without permission. The kid could get a faux-hawk in a rainbow, but would need parental consent, because he's *a minor*.", "Of course I can, but OP should have called his parents to make sure they\u2019re okay with it.", "Did you also give birth to his friend without anyone knowing?\n\nYTA, and quite the cavernous one at that", "He's a minor. His parents can give him that choice, not you.", "Aaron is a minor.  You can\u2019t go around cutting other people\u2019s children\u2019s hair without permission.  The fact that you didn\u2019t even think to ask his parents is shocking.", "No, you SUGGESTED that you cut his hair. That wasn't Aaron's idea. And apparently there was already a plan for his next haircut - possibly a particular length or style? a plan to go to a particular relative or support a friend with a new shop? a bonding experience of him & his father going to dad's longtime barber? Instead it became you prioritizing feeling like \"the cool mom\" over *actually* respecting his family & his decisions.", "Maybe his parents will ask if your son wants a shaved head. He's 12. He can decide. Lol... YTA", "Yeah, we know. But Aaron is in grade school and isn\u2019t your fucking kid, so you still need to ask. That\u2019s common sense.", "Which you can do  (for YOUR kid, not anyone else\u2019s) because you\u2019re the parent.", "Aaron is a minor and you removed part of his body. \n\nDid you know a parent without legal custody cannot get their child's hair cut without the custodial parent's permission (in my state)?  If they would be in the wrong, so are you.", "SHOULD the parents let the kid make his own hair decisions? Yes.  Do they have to?  Nope.  Does that make them bad parents on that subject? I think so.  But, still.  *You* and I can\u2019t make that decision for them.  They get to be bad parents if they want to be.", "That\u2019s fine, because you are his parents. However, his friends parents need to give consent for somebody to alter his hair. I understand where you are coming from because I\u2019m the same with my child, unfortunately some parents are not the same, and in this instance, they are right to be upset that you didn\u2019t check with them.", "You let YOUR son make his decisions because you are HIS parent. Other parents may not allow their children to make decisions without their input. That is their choice, not yours.\n\nYou can parent your own child, but you need permission to make decisions about another child.\n\nWould you want other adults making decisions about what Aaron is allowed to do in their home?\n\nYou should have called the parents first.", "I know, hence she is lucky not to be facing charges.", "What the hell kind of logic is this?? Women can absolutely be charged with assault.", "A woman can face assault charges. It is not only for men.", "Take down your strawman bud, that's not what they said.", "Correct.", "\"let YOUR kid\". What's not clicking for you here?", "That's great but it's not her call to make. It says that there are good reasons to do so but it doesn't say it's the norm. She can do what she wants with her kid but not someone else's.", "I mean, are we really gonna argue that transitioning is way more of a big deal than getting a haircut?", "Absolutely not the point.\n\nITS NOT THEIR KID.\n\nJesus fucking christ people.", "It's a haircut, not a tattoo.", "if i read it correctly, aaron is their sons friend, not their son.", "OP is not the parent. Aaron is their kid's friend.", "your absurd position . Its a silly position to have imo. Go ahead... damage \"YOUR KID\".", "its the kids call... or at least should be according to child development pros.", "It's just hair. It's not a permanent decision and it wasn't on a 6 year old.\n\nA 12 year old is developmentally at the right age to be making decisions like this.", "It's a drastic change and chemical alteration to the kids' hair.

I\u2019ll edit.", "Go ahead\u2026 start doing shit like that to OTHER PEOPLES\u2019 KID and see how you do.", "It's the parents call until the say different. You can't find articles from pros and decide to do something to someone else's child. These are great articles to back up why she has made that decision for her kid but not someone else's. Would you be OK with her feeding a vegan kid meat because she read articles that it was better for them and they wanted meat?", "If you were saying that about what YOU are comfortable for YOUR child, yeah maybe.\n\nBut it's not is it.\n\nNot your kid, keep your fucking hands off them.", "i have.... i was 12 at the time.. i got compliments and everyone got free haircuts....went well", "like i said in another post.. i started cutting my hair and my friends hair ar the same age... I dont see the problem... Who cut the hair seem irrelevant.. only if its wrong for the kid to decide he wants it.", ">I was 12 at the time.\n\nSo not the same as this situation at all because you weren\u2019t a full grown adult doing something to someone else\u2019s kid without permission? Okay, next.", "Let me guess, this was a year or two ago? You seem to have no concept of adult or parenting responsibilities or the difference between bodily autonomy and changing another person\u2019s (in this case a minor\u2019s) body.", "i dint see much of a diffwrwnce.. you either think its ok for a 12 yr to decide thier own bairstyle or not, who cuts it is irrelevant...next", "i posted it was the 80s,.. i am 46 now.... its hair.\n\nIf a kid wejt tk a hair salon and paid to get a hair cut... is it wrong? its not illegal.", "Grow up. Not that I have kids, but if someone were to cut AND DYE my MINOR CHILD\u2019s hair without so much as a text to see if it\u2019s okay, not only would my child never be allowed over again, but they\u2019d be lucky to not get popped in the mouth too. IT\u2019S NOT YOUR KID, NOT YOUR DECISION. This is practically the same as that other post, \u201cI\u2019m on my nephew\u2019s take home list and he\u2019s close with my son so I\u2019m allowed to take him from school whenever I want without asking his parents!!!\u201d", "well youd goto jail its that simple.\n\nTake the same logic... what is a teacher teaches science instead of\"iintellegent design\"... Is that abuse because an adult is doing somthing a parent does not approve of? At what point is doing the right thing for the child ,more important that the primative thoughts and wishes of a parent?"]}
