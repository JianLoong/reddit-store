If my three year old wanted blue hair, I\u2019d help them safely get it. It is INSANE to me that anyone would give a shit. \n\nThat being said, especially when a kid isn\u2019t late teens, I am NOT THEIR PARENT. We can debate whether or not it\u2019s morally acceptable for a parent to control their child\u2019s hair. I personally do not think it is. But A LOT OF FUCKING PEOPLE don\u2019t see it that way. Wrong or right, MOST people would read it as a MASSIVE overreach to mess with a child\u2019s hair without their parents\u2019 permission. \n\nSo personally? Genuinely don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole. Anyone should feel free to do whatever they want with their hair, ESPECIALLY when they\u2019re underage and not in a job market and are pretty much free, because a public school can\u2019t kick you out, at least. \n\nBut most people will see it as an overstep, as \u201cinterfering with their parenting\u201d. I think any child should be able to have that small amount of control over their own presentation. I would also let my kids do a lot of things other parents wouldn\u2019t allow (For example, I would NEVER raise a hand to my child, but I ABSOLUTELY will let them touch something hot or fall off of a skateboard trying something I\u2019ve tried telling them they aren\u2019t ready for, natural consequences type things), but won\u2019t allow certain things other parents would (my children will NOT have unsupervised screen time, only approved shows/games until they\u2019re middle/high school aged and I can relatively trust their judgement). I\u2019d let my kid have a half shaved head with their remaining hair neon green at age six, but I wouldn\u2019t let them have unsupervised internet time. And that\u2019s my standards as a parent. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to agree with someone else\u2019s parental standards. At the same time, if the kid isn\u2019t being abused physically or emotionally, you have no right to undermine other parents. Legally, even if the abuse is emotional, and sometimes even physical, you don\u2019t have a right/a place to intervene. That\u2019s hard for me personally.

Isn't that what really matters? /s", "Legally, yes - assault. I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s what I would do, but assault doesn\u2019t not require any physical harm to be done. Basically attempting or threatening to do something to someone that isn\u2019t your right to do, that\u2019s assault.", "> THE CHILD IS 12 and technically what OP could be considered assault of a minor\n\nThis is why children are so goddamn soft these days.", "Sounds like you have a monster IL", "And when she called it a \u201cbob\u201d. She did it on purpose to suit her agenda. Definitely TA.", "Even if you don't charge, you can be liable for any damages. If the kid had a bad reaction to the dye, etc.", "Love this! Good for your grandson!", "I'm curious about this too, a lot of comments on this thread mentioning hairdressers do this but I've moved a lot, so therefore been to a lot of different salons, and I've never had a patch test done.", "Wow, some of you are going to some dodgy salons!!  In the UK you\u2019re meant to patch test at least 48 hours before colour treatment. You don\u2019t have to redo it before each appointment but you do if you haven\u2019t been for say 9 months or more.", "Children in my province can consent to getting therapy lol it's wild that people think they can't consent to a haircut.", "In the US in a lot of states children can consent to certain medical treatments as well. Especially STD related. I think the parent commenter is incorrect about consent. \n\nEg: https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/policies/law/states/minors.html", "Exactly. Parents may have upcoming events or similar and preferred no color. I would have let my child do whatever to her hair but would have had issue with another parent giving a buzz cut and color", "Op called it a bob", "Lol. My son goes to the barber alone since he was 11. No questions asked ever. \nThen again, I certainly wouldn\u2019t like to have a friend\u2019s parent doing it without at least texting me first.", "I think there's a healthier in between somewhere.\n\nYour parents cared way too much. It shouldn't be such a big decision for a thing that is not permanent.", "Totally ok sentence without the word boy. What's boy got to do with it?", "Let's put it this way. I'm sure we can all agree that a 12yo child does not have the bodily autonomy to decide to get piercings and tattoos on their own, without their parent's consent and permission. So now we've established a line exists somewhere between a child's own body autonomy and a parent's consent. Where that line exists, is up to the parents of the child to decide.\n\nOP was too busy trying to be the cool hip laid back divorc\u00e9e mom to her kid, that she is used to no longer asking for permission from the her kid's father on things like this, she didn't even think to find out where that line is with the kid's parents. A simple phone call would have been enough.\n\nNot only did you damage the two kid's relationship, because there is no way they will allow their kid to go there ever again, you also damaged that kid's relationship with his parents. When you leave your child with someone, the hope is that they are returned in the same state. Also, he will not understand why they are mad, because an adult authority figure that is not his parents said it was okay. And now they will have to hear, \"But OP lets her kid do X.\" You've now set a standard in that household, that those parents never agreed or prepared for.\n\nOP may believe that she has her own child under control, while allowing certain amounts of expression, to steer him to being a contributor in society. But this might have been the catalyst for rebellion in this child, because now these parents are forced to be more controlling in his life, and I'm sure he won't like it.", "I agree with you so much.ive seen my kid almost make decisions like that being caught in the moment and pressured. I always make my kids sleep on decisions like this. They want a big hair cut? Think for 24 hours, if you still do we will do it. Kids are impulsive. I don't want them to see something on TV or a friend doing and jump to the same without thinking it through. \n\nMy oldest is 14. I'd atleast want a text (with a response from me) to tell me whats happening. She can cut, dye, shave her hair, no problem. But if another adult is doing it I expect some consideration that it is my minor child.", "This is just crazy.. people our wilding out in 2023 .. back in the day that would of lead to more than a phone call", "I, as an adult, used to have long hair. Almost to my butt. I got constant remarks from my mom about how I needed to cut my hair, particularly after I had surgery on one arm and needed her help washing my hair. Eventually I just started paying super cuts $10 for a hair wash rather than listen to my mom complain about my long hair. I shaved my head to a Mohawk a couple years ago, only like 3 inches long. It's about chin length now, but I keep both sides of my head shaved because I have thick hair that is very heavy. Ever since I cut all my hair off my mom has begun to make comments about me about growing my hair back out. Just can't make her happy. I think it's a generational thing because neither my mom or her other grandma were pleased when my then 13 yr old started dyeing her hair purple. My kid let the purple grow out then cut it off and both grandma's are making comments about how much better she looks. All that's left is about 3 inches of what is now totally blonde hair from color fade. Jokes on them though, my kid is getting her hair done for her birthday", "Yeah she definitely hated his hair.  She not only cut it but put color in it.  And then...what?  Expected applause from the parents?  My kid would never be allowed over there again.  You cannot trust OPs judgement.", "For sure. This was one of the somewhat minor and  amusing in hindsight things he did.", "My daughter's friend came for a sleepover and showed up *with hair dye* and I still texted her mom to make sure it was OK (it wasn't lol)\n\nYTA", "A bob is specific cut/style, not an insult.", "NTA\n\nNo crime or tort has been committed here since the haircut was consensual.\n\nYou didn't need the parent's permission to cut Aaron's hair, **Aaron** needed his parents permission to get his hair cut and either they did not make this clear to him or he *chose* to get it cut anyway. Their only recourse here is to punish Aaron if they don't like what he's done, Aaron is not their property such that they can control how other people interact with him, they only have *authority* over him. The fact that they are angry at **you** and not Aaron is because they are assholes; it was not your responsibility to know that you \"needed\" permission to cut Aaron's hair from his parents, because legally you didn't, you only needed permission from Aaron himself.\n\nPeople on Reddit have some warped American-centric misunderstanding of how the laws actually apply when it comes to children (even in the USA) where they believe that anyone who even looks at their child without their permission is committing a crime or encroaching their legal rights. This misunderstanding conflates a common social view in America that children are \"property\" of their parents until they turn 18 and so doing anything without parental permission must be potentially illegal, with the actual *legal* concept of parental authority, which says no such thing.\n\nParental authority just means that the parent is allowed to make decisions for the child and to punish the child for not following their decisions. This *wouldn't* be legal to do to an adult. In this case, the parents could *make* their child cut their hair by punishing them if they didn't, or punish them for getting their hair cut without permission. What they can't do is **force** anyone else to require their permission to engage in a consensual activity with their child, they would need to pro-actively make the decision to remove the child from the situation instead. Failing to allow them to remove their child from the situation could be harrassment.\n\nMinors can't consent to some things until they reach a certain age, primarily sex, and they also *can't consent to enter contracts*. Anything else that is legally age-restricted is **very** explicit i.e. tobacco, alcohol, age-restricted materials. There are several things that are legal *with parental permission* from a certain age too, which is again **very** explicit **for a reason**. Parents in the Us do have the legal right to make *medical* decisions for minors, but this is only because the parents are financially responsible for their kid's healthcare. In countries with free healthcare, children are able to consent to their own medical treatment from a much younger age.\n\nAgain, age-related consent and permission laws are **explicit**.\n\nHaircuts do not fall under any of these laws: they are not a medical treatment, they are not legally age-restricted, they are not sexual, they do not require parental permission and they do not form a contract. The only time a haircut is illegal is when the person **receiving** it does not consent (in which case it becomes assault.)", "I we went from buzzcuts my whole life to a lions mane of hair. It's been 3 years and I still laugh and say omg I have hair.", "Yes I know, I misread the post and thought OP called it a blob rather than a bob.", "I\u2019m not missing anything. I\u2019m saying the bigger issue is that the kid didn\u2019t want the haircut in the first place, so OP wouldn\u2019t have needed to ask permission if she had just respected the kid\u2019s wishes. \n\nOP wanted this kid to have short hair, so she was going to make that happen no matter what. \n\nPressuring a kid to cut their hair is not ok. That can lead to other issues with boundaries and bodily autonomy.", "Yup! Parent just potentially ruined a friendship because they have zero common sense. \n\nI couldn\u2019t imagine cutting my son\u2019s best friends hair just because he asked said it was cool. \n\nIf this is his best friend I have to imagine they have the parents numbers so just call or text to verify if it is ok. You don\u2019t just do something to another person\u2019s kid even if it is just hair.", "This is bizarre. As soon as I could articulate how I wanted my hair I was allowed to get it done. My only restriction was that haircuts cost money. Your aunt doing it for free would have been a blessing. This story doesn't make your mom look good, blessings to your aunt.", "I am not a lawyer. But I would appreciate it if you could explain:\n\nYou were saying that children can\u2019t consent to contracts. I understand and agree with that. \n\nBut isn\u2019t assault/battery _unwanted_ touching? I don\u2019t see how _contracts_ fit in to non-commercial hair cutting. \n\n(12 year olds of course can consent to certain medical treatments in a lot of states so the broad \u201cchildren can\u2019t _consent_\u201d claim is obviously silly)", "No worries, what I'm explaining is that the act of cutting hair can be technically seen as assault, I'm not saying this woman can or should face any criminal charges, it was just some legal trivia that I happened to know. \n\nAnd the whole contract thing was brought up by the other commenter, I'm not saying there is a contract here, but pointing out that the other commenter is incorrect by saying that a child can enter into contracts fully. They can't under UK law and I would assume the same in US.\n\nThe entire point of this comment thread was misconstrued by a wanna Harvey Spectre, she's morally an asshole for shaving a kid's head without speaking to his parents. Followed by a warning that in a very technical way, it could be seen as a crime, then followed by the argument that a child cannot fully consent to many things, and so just taking their approval is not sound legal or moral judgement.\n\nIt then devolves around this guy asking why barbers don't ID people and why shops sell to kids if they can't properly consent, it seems he couldn't understand the fact that every very possible very technical legal issue that could arise gets dragged into court.", "Thank you. he was definitely something else.", "He just walked in, never seen before by the barber, and got his haircut?", "Uh, yeah that would also be fine. My parents wouldn't give two shits.\n\nAs for liability, you would only be liable if you harmed someone. A haircut is not particularly risky.", "Out of the blue", "And, I know a lot of schools are out for summer, but some are year round- what if color is against the dress code? This happened to me, my school thought my hair dye was \u2018too red\u2019 and insisted my parents dye it a more natural color (it was not too red but whatever). Hair isn\u2019t indestructible, and shouldn\u2019t be processed a ton. \n\nThat and idk if the kid understands the process hair goes through when it\u2019s dyed. I sure didn\u2019t. I melted my hair lol. \n\nThe cut is bad enough, it crosses a line. But the coloring just yeeted the line into a different dimension."]}
