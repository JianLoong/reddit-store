So, you're not the AH for refusing to pay for your adult kid. \n\nYou're a little bit an AH for telling your ex to go to hell. You could just tell her no.", "You don\u2019t need to pay your adult son\u2019s expenses, but you pretty much sounds like an AH just the way you talk.  Learn to say \u201cno\u201d without being a d*ck.  At least for your kids sake since they\u2019ll model your behavior.  YTA", "Ehhh 50-50 YTA\n\nYou're absolutely right that as a 19 year old it's time to face reality and either sink or swim. You're absolutely right that your ex's finances are not your problem. You did great on giving him a chance in your home to let him figure things out for himself, even if you didn't.\n\nBut the way you talk to them and about them? YTA. You are choosing to be incredibly callous and snide. Sometimes exes don't get along, but ffs learn to show and speak to people with respect. Maybe you're right, but that alone makes it no wonder your marriage failed", "NTA. Your son is an adult, you have him help already, and being a freeloader is not a career choice.", "NTA\u2026maybe your son can get a job and help his mom with the extra costs?", "NTA. Let the 19 yr old get a job. At 19, there are two choices, school or work.", "NTA. He needs to get his shit figured out. His mother's finances aren't your problem. Maybe your son should get a job.", "NTA however I do think you should work on having a civil relationship with your ex.  You don't have to be abusive towards her and can show your son that you can give her basic human respect.  A \"No, he is now an adult and if you choose to house him that's on you.  I suggest you have him look for a job.\"  Would have been a much more appropriate response.\n\nThis comes from someone who is constantly abused by their own ex and has to be the bigger person because that's what is best for the child.  I feel bad for your son being raised in that type of hostility.  I hope you can at least show his mom basic respect going forward.", "YTA just for how obnoxious you sound. Seems like your ex is in a tough spot and you are too much of an A$H to be civil. I feel badly for your current wife and kids", "NTA.  None of this is your issue.", "Would you be open to letting him stay with you if he followed some rules and got a job?", "guess its time he gets a job to help out.   NTA", "Probably gonna get downvoted for this but YTA. Yes your son is technically an adult and it sounds like a poor decision on his part to drop out of school, and it was nice that you let him stay with you for a while. But you kicked him out knowing that he had the option to go live with his mother. She can't kick him out because he doesn't have the option to come back to live with you, and what mother us going to kick their child out with nowhere to go?\n\nIt is not an ideal situation but you are still his father and can afford to help, but it sounds like you are refusing to help out to spite your ex more than anything else. Not paying towards your son is also an option that his mother doesn't have. It must be nice for you to have all those options", "You don't have to give her money, and I'm even okay with not letting your son freeload at your place if he refuses to make a plan, but the way you talk makes you sound like an AH, so YTA anyway.  It's possible to have a backbone and not be an AH at the same time.", "NTA. Son is an adult. As is ex-wife. Let them figure out their own garbage and don't let them bring it into your life.", "NTA.\n\nHe's 19. You gave him a chance to figure his shit out, he didn't. \n\nIt's not on you to fund him now, he's an adult. You don't kick somebody out of your house for being an unemployed waster with no idea of what they're going to do ... only to fund them living somewhere else and doing the same. \n\nYou were right to tell her to go to hell.", "NTA. I would do the same thing", "YTA - the responsibility to look after your kids doesn\u2019t expire when they go off to college or reach whatever age is considered adulthood in your country. Additionally, if you have a child with someone you will always be tied to that person for as long as your child is alive. \n\nYou chose to have a kid with this woman, either through not using protection, or on purpose. Those are the risks. \n\nYour son deserves to have a home he can turn to. You should want your son to have a dream he can pursue, not just merely survive. By not helping him out that\u2019s the reality of the situation, his efforts will be only on survival and not on who he is, what kind of person he wants to be, or what his potential is. \n\nHaving separated parents will always leave emotional wounds on a child, even in the most harmonious separated families, those wounds are multiplied tenfold when you\u2019re treated as a burden and when your parents hate each other. He is half you and half your ex, how is he ever supposed to love himself and see his own potential when he likely has to deal with the visceral hate you have for your ex and therefore half of him.", "NTA, you don't owe your ex anything, and you certainly don't have to keep paying for your adult son simply because he *chooses* to be completely unproductive.  School or work.  Pick one.  \n\nAs for those who are faulting you for being \"mean\" to your ex, I can hardly fault you for having the response of fuck off to a request for money so she can be the good guy and afford to let your son be a bum.  Yes by all means it seems completely reasonable to say I know we've been divorced for over a decade and I want to allow our son to be irresponsible as hell, and even though by your words and actions you are completely against it why don't you give me hundreds of dollars a month so he never has to grow up.", "YTA YTA YTA sheeeeeeesh", "So, your son is making bad choices and you're just gonna quit being his father anymore. Because you have your new family to think of. YTA", "Did you parent card expire or something??\n\nBe more involved in your kids life. Kids aren't all perfect and they struggle too. Have you wondered why a good student would all of a sudden quit and be apathetic?\n\nYou gave your kid ONE chance! And then you kicked him out. He's a teenager. He needs guidance and help. Would you kick out your \"new shiny kids\" if they screwed up? \n\nYTA", "NTA -- at 19, two choices -- work or school.  I would not enable him\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT -- and he is lucky to have school a choice, some kids do not", "NTA. My buddy has a rule with his kids. Employed, education and or in training, no exceptions.\n\nMost people use \"finding themselves\" as a bullshit excuse to fuck around and do nothing.\n\nThe fact that your ex has employment issues and doesn't want to lay down the law isn't your concern.", "NTA - I mean, you probably could have been less harsh about it. But you\u2019re not obligated to financially support your 19yr old who refused to get a job.", "YTA. For multiple reasons. You\u2019re setting yourself up for a painful and tortured relationship with your oldest son. He\u2019s probably a fuck up because of the bad relationship between his parents.\nHe will look at his younger half-siblings with contempt and hatred, because you didn\u2019t do squat for him, but are obviously going to support them financially when they are older. \n\n1. He\u2019s still your son, you don\u2019t legally have to pay child support, but 19 is still a child. Because he\u2019s a legal adult, doesn\u2019t mean you can wash your hands of him. You\u2019re supposed to start making an adult relationship with your children, not throw them to the wolves.\n2. You fumbled when you said it was permissible to drop out and let him move in. That was a mistake. Make an ultimatum, if he goes back to college you can help financially, otherwise he needs to get a job. \n3. You need to be civil with your ex- even if you say no to her. Go to hell is not an appropriate response, and it sounds like you\u2019ve also got some growing up to do.", "NTA, your son needs to figure out what he\u2019s doing with his life", "NTA.  Your son is a grown man.  He made the decision on his own to drop out of college, so now he needs to make a decision on what he's going to do to support himself.", "NTA. He\u2019s an ADULT. He should be living on his own", "NTA at ALL. OP I'm proud of you for stranding your ground. You owe your ex nothing and your son needs a damn job. At his age I was working two jobs and living with my best friend. It was awesome. He needs to let go of his dependency on mommy and become a big boy.", "NTA. Your son is 19. He should be the one helping his mother out with the extra expenses his being there brought about. Sure, I get not knowing what you want to do with your future at 19 years old, but you can figure that out while working a job, going to school, or both.", "NTA. He can't expect you and his mother to foot his bills and life. It's not you fault his mom took him in and didn't make him contribute.", "NTA", "NTA. If he wants to figure out his life he can do it without your financial help. He's old enough to get a job and support himself. College isn't for everyone but being a slacker sponging off your parents should never be an option. If his mother is letting this happen that's her problem not yours.", "NTA he exploited your kindness, it's a shock to me that you saw two girls walking out from your own house, I would never think to do such a thing if I was him, he is just lazy and immature.", "NTA for not paying for your adult son. \nYTA for how you spoke your ex wife. Your son should be getting a job instead of his mother getting a second job.", "ESH\n\nYour son is certainly on a path to non-success, but the way you talk to him and your ex isn't winning you any points in my book. \n\nWho is paying for his cell phone and cell phone plan right now? Does he have a car? Who pays Who pays for his gas? Does he have the internet password at his mother's house and access to streaming? I would consider taking measures to make his situation a little less comfortable and let him know that if he wants nice things, he is going to have to start working full time in order to pay for them himself, or else he can reenroll in school full time.", "Nta but don\u2019t be rude to your ex just tell her to make your son get a job.", "Yta. \n\nFor how you treat your own kid. \n\nGuess you don't need him around since you make a whole new family, right?", "So it's perfectly OK to go tell him kid off and to go to hell?
