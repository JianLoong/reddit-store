Your mom wants you to apologize because she doesn\u2019t want you to make it into a big deal, but if you\u2019re up for it and able to, I would contest that fine. it\u2019s crazy that a CHILD can be FINED to me ??? and for THAT??", "I mean if it gets you in trouble and you\u2019re (sadly) surrounded by men who think little of women, AND you have to pay a fine I think there\u2019s a point where you have to pick your battles and just find a better way to fight this. NTA but be careful out there and thank you for sticking up for the right things", "NTA\n\nYour teacher WAS being sexist. He targeted a specific gender with his comment. If he wasn't, he would have said it's made \"us all\" lazier.\n\nGood on you for calling him out. Being an advocate for decency and respect will never be easy in the face of such ingrained bigotry, but you are a shining example of integrity. \n\nIf you are forced to give an apology,  say something like \"I'm sorry you were butt hurt I called out your sexism\".", "NTA at all, that was very sexist of him.\n\nReading in a reply you are from Pakistan, so you are in a country where women are still being massivly discriminated against, it is horrible that your actions in your enviroment might be viewed as you being in the wrong. But let me assure you, you are not.   \nStay safe and I wish you all the best.", "NTA, but unfortunately, pushing this may be unsafe for you. The advice you receive here will be from a Western perspective, and unfortunately, that\u2019s very far away from your reality. Women should be equal everywhere, but in many places sexism is institutional and it\u2019s a very long, hard and unsafe journey to make change. This isn\u2019t to say you should just \u2018take it\u2019 and accept things, but you might want to interact with others who understand your context better and help you stay safe in the way you challenge things.", "NTA - fair play to you!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

No point trying to continue this it'll only make them resent you more and they will make life harder for you.", "NTA. \n\nWhat he said was a lazy dad joke at best, but it seems like he took offense because you projected it as an attack at him by not only mentioning bikes but something he was directly holding.", "NTA. I admire you for recognizing sexism and doing something about it. That teacher sounds like he prolly thinks washing machines and running water in a home are not necessarily. You prolly know that in the past, and still in the world today, that there are cultures where (mostly women) people spend entire days washing clothing by hand, hauling water from long distances, or gathering food. \n\nHow much expertise and intelligence is not utilized by people who have to focus on their basic existence for most of every day?", "Women can't ride bikes??? No wonder the teacher made such a comment, I'm curious which Asian country is it. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou did the ethical thing. Your mom probably just wants for you to be safe, she knows people in positions of power are petty and is worried the teacher will retaliate against you.

I am amazed that this young man recognized the sexism and replied to it.", "Good point"]}
