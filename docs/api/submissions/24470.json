Your mom wants you to apologize because she doesn\u2019t want you to make it into a big deal, but if you\u2019re up for it and able to, I would contest that fine. it\u2019s crazy that a CHILD can be FINED to me ??? and for THAT??", "I mean if it gets you in trouble and you\u2019re (sadly) surrounded by men who think little of women, AND you have to pay a fine I think there\u2019s a point where you have to pick your battles and just find a better way to fight this. NTA but be careful out there and thank you for sticking up for the right things", "NTA\n\nYour teacher WAS being sexist. He targeted a specific gender with his comment. If he wasn't, he would have said it's made \"us all\" lazier.\n\nGood on you for calling him out. Being an advocate for decency and respect will never be easy in the face of such ingrained bigotry, but you are a shining example of integrity. \n\nIf you are forced to give an apology,  say something like \"I'm sorry you were butt hurt I called out your sexism\".", "NTA at all, that was very sexist of him.\n\nReading in a reply you are from Pakistan, so you are in a country where women are still being massivly discriminated against, it is horrible that your actions in your enviroment might be viewed as you being in the wrong. But let me assure you, you are not.   \nStay safe and I wish you all the best.", "NTA, but unfortunately, pushing this may be unsafe for you. The advice you receive here will be from a Western perspective, and unfortunately, that\u2019s very far away from your reality. Women should be equal everywhere, but in many places sexism is institutional and it\u2019s a very long, hard and unsafe journey to make change. This isn\u2019t to say you should just \u2018take it\u2019 and accept things, but you might want to interact with others who understand your context better and help you stay safe in the way you challenge things.", "NTA - fair play to you!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But I haven\u2019t seen any on bikes.", "NTA. \n\nBut yeah just pay the fine and move on. No point trying to continue this it'll only make them resent you more and they will make life harder for you.", "NTA. \n\nWhat he said was a lazy dad joke at best, but it seems like he took offense because you projected it as an attack at him by not only mentioning bikes but something he was directly holding.", "NTA. I admire you for recognizing sexism and doing something about it. That teacher sounds like he prolly thinks washing machines and running water in a home are not necessarily. You prolly know that in the past, and still in the world today, that there are cultures where (mostly women) people spend entire days washing clothing by hand, hauling water from long distances, or gathering food. \n\nHow much expertise and intelligence is not utilized by people who have to focus on their basic existence for most of every day?", "Women can't ride bikes??? No wonder the teacher made such a comment, I'm curious which Asian country is it. NTA.", "NTA\n\nYou did the ethical thing. Your mom probably just wants for you to be safe, she knows people in positions of power are petty and is worried the teacher will retaliate against you. Thank you for standing up against misogyny.", "NTA. Don\u2019t apologize. Hold the line.", "you did amazing, and what you did it very ethical. dont apologize. youre in the right. NTA", "Pakistan. Women are allowed to ride but they can't drive.", "Thank you", "\u2728Pakistan the state of misogyny and homophobia\u2728", "You are absolutely right but you are also in Pakistan where women absolutely aren't treated equally, so good luck I guess.", "In a country where gender discrimination is official state doctrine, a debate about dishwasher jokes seems more like a fight against windmills to me. So think about whether you really want to play Don Quixote or just direct your efforts towards leaving the country.", "Everything has to start somewhere. I am amazed that this young man recognized the sexism and replied to it.", "Good point", "NTA and your a good kid and a future good man ! \nBut becareful because a country where women are not allowed to ride bicycles will surely not be kind to young people who use their free speech", "NTA... Don't stop using that brilliant brain of yours.", "You go guy! You were in the right to call him out-like you did! (And you did is surgically!) Good Job! Don\u2019t apologize for speaking the truth- maybe he\u2019ll think twice the next time he wants to say something stupid\u2026", "NTA - it takes guts to stand up to authority in that way!", "NTA.  But this is a good example of the difference between intelligence and wisdom.  Intelligence is knowing that your teacher is wrong and that he is a sexist pig who\u2019s full of shit.  Wisdom is realizing that he\u2019s basically a professional troll who\u2019s going to make you eat shit.

I applaud OP and hope he grows up to work for change in his own country. And challenging micro aggressions IS working for change. Tilt at those windmills OP!", "Thanks I didn't know about that. I guess they are allowed in the law but I haven't seen any woman driving a bike here. It was the only comeback I had at the top of my head at that time lol.", "and it's a regular thing in his class. He keeps making casual \"jokes\" about how women after 30 are useless or talking in feminine voice to make fun of gays and he does this to lighten our mood.\nHe's insufferable I just snapped this time.", "you did good", "Now you understand why you probably only go to school with other boys.

The best thing you can do right now is get your education credentials and get out of there while retaining your ideals, and sticking to them.", "NTA. it was sexist as its possible to be.", "I thought it was ironic that the teacher said the dishwasher made women lazy when it was invented by a women.

Speak up and speak loud!", "Fighting at the lowest level is a drop in the ocean for these kind of things. This will require protesting, civil revolutions, a political ruling shift, new laws, new education, new everything. His generation probably won't even see the fruit of that, it will require a shit-ton of time to see it actually happen. \n\nThe most this will do is get OP in trouble for trying to educate a brainwashed person that won't change his ways unless he sees the entire world around him change.", "Even though your advice might be of greater benefit to Pakistani society, I believe my suggestion might be of greater benefit to OP as a person. And because I value individuals more than groups, I'll stick to my food for thought. But ultimately it's OP's decision.", "I think there is hope. My generation is far more tolerant than my parents or elders. And especially with the current chaotic political situation here youth have been waking up and realising how fvcked up our whole system is.There are many like me but we can't this stuff outright.\nbut unfortunately most of the youth don't want to stay in this country anymore, these values don't represent us.", "A journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.", "What you\u2019re doing has probably made a huge difference to others.", "Even worse he's saying this infront of girls in my class.
