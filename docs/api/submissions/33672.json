They can use them when they visit your house!", "Definitive NTA I\u2019m a grandmother and when I give my 2 year granddaughter a gift her parents can either take it with them or leave at my house, whatever works for them.

If she wants grandma's house toys, those just need to appear in a closet/toy box, not wrapped up under the tree! (Plus grandma's house toys are free game for all the grandkids, so if there are other gkids, is she re-wrapping??)\n\nI just listened to a podcast about why littles dump their toys- their brains can't \"finish\" what they see. So you and I can see that red block is part of an archway if we see part of it, but little kids can't see that it's an archway until they see the whole thing. We've had enough experiences that our brain fills in the blanks, and until they are like 4-5 years old, their brains just can't do that. So dumping toys is aggravating, but also an important step in brain,  vision development, and a pre reading skill! (It's the same way your brain can finish words you read before you actually finish the word.", "NTA. My MIL does this a bit too. She babysits our kids so it makes sense to keep toys there and it\u2019s fine theoretically that she\u2019s gifting things at her house to stay at her house, but I\u2019ll put something their Amazon list, she buys it, then insists it stays at her house. Stuff can stay but she needs to come up with her own gift ideas instead of taking mine for herself. Last Christmas my middle kept asking to play with a Bluey house at home so I put one on the list. MIL bought it and insisted she keep it, but the kicker is she already had one at her house! Why does she need two???", "NTA  Hope you also got him duplo blocks for home.

Grandma here. That's weird. I buy gifts so they can be enjoyed by my granddaughter. I do have \"grandma's house\" toys, but that's only because it makes it easier for visits. My daughter and son in law don't have to pack toys, one less worry with getting a little ready to go. They were all purchased by me. Seems like a power play. Probably best to just move on and not let Grandma know it upset you because she will find some weird reason to hold that against you. As for BIL, he's just kissing a$$ for some reason.

Or do you plan to bring a variety of toys for your child to play with every time you are visiting grandma? Your BIL also bought these, perhaps with his own kids in mind to also play with when he and his kids are visiting grandma? Maybe grandma should have been upfront about her intentions, though.\n\nI do think that she could have allowed your son to take one gift home, though, so it felt more like it's properly his, but I do understand why she'd be gifting some toys for your son to play with when he is visiting her.\n\nSounds like you don't have money for Duplo?

Brother was playing g with some A B C blocks and his hot wheels.  He built a garage.  Our aunt told him that isn\u2019t the correct way to use them. Bro g 4he didn\u2019t understand what she meant so she told him that if he couldn\u2019t play right, he couldn\u2019t use them. She took them away. She explained that he was supposed to make words, not a building. \n\nThe worst part, she was an elementary school teacher.", "NTA. I\u2019d have taken whatever you gave her and said she can play with it when she visits.", "NTA. I hope you returned the gifts with the biggest of grins. \n\nYou should absolutely cut down on the time son spends at that household. Let them enjoy their gift.", "Those weren't gifts. They were blackmail. MIL is trying to force you to bring your kid to her house, and using the toy as bait.", "NTA. Take back her present and tell her it\u2019s only to be used at your house. Bonus points if it\u2019s cash.", "NTA.\n\nOnce gifted it doesn\u2019t matter who paid for them. The purchaser is not the owner. The receiver owns them and decides what to do with them.

You don\u2019t gift a child a toy then say \u2018they\u2019re mine!\u2019  Rude AF! She should be buying \u2018grandma toys\u2019 for herself. I\u2019d be mad too.", "he wasn\u2019t around then the conflict happened, he was outside at the car. when i told him what happened he was grumpy with them", "The kind of monster who wants to try to force more time with the child.

Hope granny enjoys her new dust collector.", "It's to ensure that the kid wants to go to grandma's house.. cause she has the cool toys. I'd retaliate by visiting her less and trying to ensure that the kid knows that \"grandma doesn't share\" and trying to desensitise them to it.", "OP, IF you can afford it, I'd buy the same toys for your son at your house. Then, he feels like he has his presents, and if she asks about him coming over to play them, you can sweetly let her know he has the same set at his house, so he's okay.", "he wasn\u2019t around! he was out at the car sorting the car seat etc", "NTA.  I agree.  And BIL was unnecessarily rude!  A gift doesn\u2019t have stipulations.

We lived in a small apartment for a while so she'll tell us if you guys want you guys can leave the bigger toys here for them. We see her quite often", "With my mom, toys that she gave to my niece and nephew as little kids were generally assumed by all to be for grandma\u2019s house, since she babysat them every day - toys from their parents or other relatives were for home. But if there was something they wanted to take with them they were certainly welcomed to do so. But toys given to my kid went home with us because we live 6 hours away and are only able to visit about 4 times a year.

If she wanted toys for her grandchild at her home, she should have just bought them for the home, not gifted them.\n\nWhether or not the parents could afford to buy these toys is completely irrelevant. Actually read the story. They *do* bring toys with them, MIL is just overly controlling. And you sound just as controlling as the MIL if you think OP is in the wrong. They barely go to MIL's house. Kind of cruel to give a gift and not allow the person to enjoy it the way they want.", "I am OLD.  My child is an adult.\n\nI considered it my job to provide toys for GP's homes.

Buy him the same ones and don't bring him back there - and let them know that because they ***LIED*** by presenting those to him him as gifts, you were forced to replace them for him *and won't be returning to her place in order to avoid them lying to him*.  Don't hear any argument to the contrary - hang up on either her or BIL the second they bring it up and block.

Well, they both suck and that was intentional. Tell him what they did.", "Ahh. I hope he has your back now and tells your BIL to stop being such a ridiculous idiot.", "Plus, if BIL had issues, he should've spoken ti brother.
