My cousin's wife laughed saying she's been doing that daily for over a week now. \n\nI laughed too and said \"in some cultures they say that means the child is looking for their sibling so be careful!\" All but two of the older relatives laughed, cousin's wife cracked a joke about knocking the baby over because that was the last thing they needed, we moved on.\n\nGot a call about a week ago with my Aunt SCREAMING at me. She was barely making any sense and eventually my Uncle took the phone from her and said something about keeping the witchcraft away from them and how dare I ruin something that should have been a special private moment between husband and wife and then taking away their right to announce their way. I didn't even know what they were talking about. Whenever I tried to speak they cut me off to yell more so I hung up and called my mom asking what was going on.\n\nSo, it turns out cousin's wife actually IS pregnant. I called to congratulate them but the wife wouldn't speak to me and my cousin said I should have kept my nose out of their business and to not call them again.

Unless I missed something, you had no EFFING clue she was/is preggers. You just made a joke based on your knowledge of other cultures. Yeah, your family is/are AHs, and while I appreciate your feelings for your cousin, you DO NOT owe anyone an apology. They owe you. For any of them that are blowing up to phone, block them.
