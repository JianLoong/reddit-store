I feel like I'm going insane.\n\nMy mom's side of the family is religious. My mom brought us to church every week, did all the sacraments, sent us to Catholic school our whole lives but it doesn't bother her that I'm not a believer. She said she could tell I was skeptical even as a child. I'm very spiritual. There's only a couple older family members that it really bothers at all. But it's not usually a topic of conversation, if they want to go to church or pray before dinner I just go with the flow. \n\nWe were all together a couple weeks ago and my cousin's baby was playing on the floor and she kept putting her head on the ground (while standing, so it looks like she's about to do a handstand) and just staying there. My cousin's wife laughed saying she's been doing that daily for over a week now. \n\nI laughed too and said \"in some cultures they say that means the child is looking for their sibling so be careful!\" All but two of the older relatives laughed, cousin's wife cracked a joke about knocking the baby over because that was the last thing they needed, we moved on.\n\nGot a call about a week ago with my Aunt SCREAMING at me. She was barely making any sense and eventually my Uncle took the phone from her and said something about keeping the witchcraft away from them and how dare I ruin something that should have been a special private moment between husband and wife and then taking away their right to announce their way. I didn't even know what they were talking about. Whenever I tried to speak they cut me off to yell more so I hung up and called my mom asking what was going on.\n\nSo, it turns out cousin's wife actually IS pregnant. I called to congratulate them but the wife wouldn't speak to me and my cousin said I should have kept my nose out of their business and to not call them again. I've been getting texts from other family members straight up calling me a devil worshipper or telling me I overstepped. At the very least I now know I was naive about how a lot of my family members feel about my beliefs.\n\nAt first I was just going to ignore it and let everything settle like the family usually does, but the reaction is making me second guess myself, and I'm definitely willing to apologize if I really did something wrong that I'm just not seeing. Hell, even if I'm not the asshole I'm considering an apology because I really love my cousin and hate that we're not on good terms.

Besides, why would anyone use their witchcraft to impregnate their cousin\u2019s wife? Lmao", "NTA. They're all as mad as a box of frogs. Get angry, stay angry and tell anyone who asks that you deserve an apology at the very least for the way you were screamed at, accused of witchcraft and blamed for something so ridiculous. \n\nIf this happened to me, I would probably never speak to any of them again. I know that's probably impossible for you to contemplate, which is fair enough, but these are not the reactions of normal, rational people. They are treating you with contempt and disrespect. Not very Christian, is it?", "NTA. Your family is ridiculous. I would just ignore them.", "Def NTA. There is a small part of my family that is a complete right-wing christian nut house and they think the rest of us are \u201cheathens.\u201d we\u2019re pretty much no contact with them now and are much better off.", "Nta. Like....wtaf?", "I\u2019ve said it before but it\u2019s still true - Catholicism is the witchcraft of Christianity so I don\u2019t know what your relatives are going off about. \n\nMeanwhile, they chant in Latin waving incense while worshipping a goddess and performing rites to eat the literal flesh and blood of their god. Hmmm.", "NTA. Honestly who cares what they think? If you look at it really they're doing you a favour, everybody who is an asshole about it is just signalling that you can cut them off and not bother with them anymore.", "NTA.

Put the fear of God in them.", "Right? \u201cLeave me alone\u2026 or I\u2019ll put a hex on you!\u201d\n\nAlthough, that could also earn OP an exorcism.", "Do it! Do it!  Those relatives are dirt squirrel crazy, so the entertainment will be off the charts. And don't forget to bring the popcorn!\n\nNTA", "Seriously, I just... can't even.  Get out OP, find people that will actually respect you and your beliefs.", "having been raised catholic i can tell you with quite a bit of sincerity it\u2019s just protestantism with a heavy dose of entitlement and a strong belief in the occult.", "yeah that should smooth things", "They're all absolutely off their gourd. OP's comment was really nothing to lose their shit over.", "No.  Don't apologize.  Just no.  That will only feed the entitlement / crazy beast.", "At that point the 'exorcism' would be kinda the prize in the cereal box!", "Having been raised Catholic (lapsed now, but) I can tell you it is extremely unusual for an entire group of people to suddenly decide a family member is using witchcraft, based upon a harmless joke.  This whole story is crazy.", "I would argue not apologising would only make them think it was intentional and feed the crazy more", "Crazy? Absolutely. I won\u2019t say your experience isn\u2019t what it was but things started to make a lot more sense to me after (very late in life after lapsing myself) learning what \u201ctransubstantiation\u201d is. Some catholic churches more than others will turn people into believers in witchcraft and the devil. I remember the pastor at the church I grew up in very much stoking that fire in a lot of parishioners. a more progressive cardinal later put an end to that but I\u2019m not surprised to hear this from older folks 50-75 in age.", "OP can totally explain OP had no idea and it was just a silly joke.  But based on the behavior of the aunt/uncle in not even letting OP talk it sounds like they're looking for capitulation.  An apology will only make it worse.  I know OP loves cousin, but if cousin loved OP back then cousin wouldn't be treating OP like this.  In the end, OP would probably be better served by waiting a week or two and then reaching out to cousin to ask why they reacted so strongly to a joke and if there was anything going on they'd like to discuss or if OP can help cousin in some way.\n\nThis way OP is giving cousin time to calm down, is reaching out with empathy, acknowledging the comment and stating it was a joke, and offering support.  If cousin reacts badly to that, fuck 'em.", "I hear you.  Transubstantiation was one of my main issues!!! (I relate to the later in life part, also \ud83d\ude0e.)  \n(ETA: Curious, though; how is it that you were raised Catholic, but didn\u2019t know the meaning of transubstantiation?  BTW, I am within your older \u201cfolks\u201d age range, also.)\n\nThe thing about this story, though, is that ALL the family, of every age, is (not only buying the idea, but) attacking OP as a witch who is obtaining information from the devil.  \nSuddenly, and based merely upon a  comment most people would recognize as harmless\u2026?  It just feels as though something is missing here. IDK", "NTA", "Wait- you made a joke and your relatives have decided you're a witch? \n\nNTA.", "NTA! Even IF you had powers, you wouldn't use them for revealing pregnancies.

The relative went nuts demanding to be \"unbaptized\". It was hilarious too.", "NTA", "NTA. Your family is NUTS!", "NTA. How could you have possibly known? It was a joke, purely coincidental.", "NTA. So they went batshit crazy over you joking about an old wive\u2019s tale because it coincided with the fact that cousin was, in fact, pregnant?!? And somehow you ruined the announcement?!?!? This is the strangest thing ever. It sounds less of a Catholic superstition issue and more of an attention-seeking-you-ruined-my-social-media-moment issue. I\u2019d stay away from the crazies for a while, if I were you.", "NTA. Religious people are apparently completely insane. What is wrong with them? They even laughed at it at the time?\n\nThese stories are tiresome. Witchcraft? Are they for real?\n\nYou didn't know they were pregnant. It was a coincidence.", "NTA they sound exhausting", "NTA! You were making a joke. This is actually something very popular in my culture and most West Indian families. I never take it seriously however I would note most times when babies are seen doing that, 9/10 times the parent does end up pregnant lol I just that funny.", "What do they mean? It was a 50/50 shot of guessing the right gender and you just happened to guess right! NTA\ud83d\ude02", "Nta. Bro graduated from hogwarts.", "NTA,  tell them to l9ok up the word \"coincidence \".", "NTA", "My mother in law did this for a while. Made a statement the was true even though she didn't know. We still call her the witchy nana.

Should put the \u201cfear of god\u201d right in then if they believe you\u2019re a \u201cwitch\u201d. You have such an awesome opportunity to be a devilish asshole, so not disappoint me.", "I'm thinking OP should exercise those relatives from her life\n\nNTA", "Dirt squirrel crazy, my new derogatory description with a PG rating.", "you must not have had a very good catechism bc anyone with a basic understanding of catholicism knows that it\u2019s quite literally the opposite of protestantism. . what exactly did you think they were protesting?\n\nsorry you feel that way about the church, but you sound like you were raised in a parish that practiced folk catholicism."]}
