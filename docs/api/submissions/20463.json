Most of our guests flying in. A lot are staying for a short weekend, some for a long weekend, and some - like Todd\u2019s family - are staying for 9 days.  \n\nMost of our guests are all arriving on the same Friday early in the morning. This includes Todd\u2019s family as well as mine.  \n\nFriday evening we are hosting a welcome event so we can greet everyone who\u2019s traveled in.  \nI haven't been able to spend much time w/ my family since I moved abroad, which bums me out. My family doesn\u2019t travel much due to financial circumstances and they have never been to the town I live in.  \n\nTodd\u2019s parents visit us 1-2x/yea. When we visit the states (1-2x/year), we make a point to spend time with them. We zoom with them 2x/month and usually talk for 90 - 120 minutes. Spending time with them is usually stressful due to not-so-great family dynamics that include a lot guilt-tripping and emotional manipulation.  \n\nAITA: I want to spend time with family and friends outside of wedding events. This means taking into account how long certain guests are here for and then spending time with them accordingly.  \nMy family and a few close friends are visiting for 3 to 4 days. Friday morning is the only time I will get to spend quality time with them outside of wedding events.  \n\nTodd\u2019s family is visiting for 9 days. We have a day already booked to spend solo time with them, including another day excursion. (Side note: I am certain they will try / guilt us into 1-2 more social events like coffee or lunch.) My partner says we need to greet them when they arrive Friday morning so they can start their trip off on the right foot. It\u2019s important to him; if we don\u2019t visit them, they will be upset.  \n\nWhen I offered that I stay with my family, he visits with his - he refused bc that would be disrespectful. He says he will have to make excuses for me.  \n\nTodd\u2019s family started an email chain letting us know that they could drop their bags off early @ their hotel and that they planned to explore the area. I sent a note back saying, \u201cGreat news! See you Friday night! Let us know if you want recommendations or need anything!\u201d  \n\nTodd says their email was an implicit ask for them to drop their bags off at our apartment and spend the day with us.  \n\nI said I only deal in explicit asks and that we\u2019ll see them that night anyways. This upset him. I told him I would prefer not to cut my family time short since we will see them that night. He said he was very disappointed and doesn\u2019t understand why I can\u2019t accommodate his family.  \n\nHonestly, I feel like I already am accommodating his family. I\u2019ve included his mom and sisters in my dress shopping / wedding day outfit. I am texting with his sisters to plan hangouts while they\u2019re here. I compromised with Todd to leave a welcome gift basket for members of his family. He isn't doing anything for my sisters.  \n\nSo: am I an asshole for not wanting to go visit with them on Friday before the event?", "created_utc": 1687603820, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14hpwky/aita_for_spending_the_morning_of_my_wedding/", "score": 164, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds to me as though there's plenty of consideration on your side, and I'm side-eyeing him a bit because it's really important to you to get to spend time with your friends, and you very rarely see them. I'd be expecting someone who loves you to want to make that space for you to spend time with your friends, rather than enabling his boundary-stomping family.\n\nBut I'd hold firm; you need your own needs met in this relationship too.\n\nI hope it's an awesome wedding and an amazing weekend!\n\nEdited to add: the whole 'Todd translating his family's 'implicit asks' to you' thing is a bit ridiculous.

Not getting the part of him wanting you to spend more time with his family I guess.\n\nI think my question is, are you asking if you are the AH for not wanting to see his family on Friday when you told them you would.
