If you instead focused on the progress, and giving small rewards for the progress then you could reinforce that your child is making good improvements that they should continue in order to hit their goal. If you had only focused on the goal, then they wouldn\u2019t see the point in trying the next time because all the efforts spent or improvements they had made didn\u2019t matter because they couldn\u2019t hit the goal and get any reward. Although it could teach them a lesson to try harder, it could teach them not to try at all because any efforts made were in vain.

Instead of only seeing the result, try setting the goal around better inputs.

Although it does seem by his lack of bad behavior and the test that he was taking it seriously. . . but if you caved he might not take it seriously next time. So I think you did the right thing. Next time I would make it 80% though since I think that is more reasonable. I would also sit down and tell him that he did do good and you are happy with him despite the test and missing out on trick or treating.", "YTA and a horrible father.

If you don't know, you're not doing your job as a parent. 7 years old, not 17 years old. Learn better parenting. His behavior starts with YOU.", "YTA amd don't be surprised if your kid doesn't bother trying. Instead of supporting improvement, you decided that he's a failure.", "YTA\n\nThe punishment exceed the crime. Tricks or treats is such a fun time. You could have found something less harsh as a punishment. Or you could have given him a home test so he would have the chance to redeem himself.", "As a former educator here\u2019s some advice: you focus on one goal at a time. Does he struggle with spelling? If he does focus on getting the behaviour under control first then work in spelling. Too many goals to attain at once overwhelms a kid this age. They will try the first few times but after failing to meet several goals you get kids that stop trying. \n\nAlso consequences should always be directly related to the behaviour. So saying \u201cif you can\u2019t show me you will behave at school I won\u2019t trust you to behave trick or treating and you can\u2019t go.\u201d Makes perfect sense.

I graduated magna cum laude after years of being a B student because the pressure finally let up. I didn\u2019t actually learn things until I was in college, and to this day definitely blame my parents for not getting into an even better university, because they used punishment as an education motivator, which any basic child-rearing book would have told them was a failing plan. They failed me by punishing me rather than helping me learn from my mistakes. Sure they can come to my wedding, but they will never have the parent/adult kid relationship I know they want.

I see parenting is not your strong suit, YTA.", "The main issue is his behaviour, which he worked on and met your expectations. A test i not 100% on his (small, young) hands. By punishing him for doing the 100% he was in control of and doing his best towards the other one but not quite reaching your demand, you only teach him that it's not worth it to make the effort. What a bad lesson for a 7 years old :(", "YTA YTA YTA.\n\nI have steam coming out of my ears.\n\nCongratulations on teaching your son that no matter how hard he tries, he will never be good enough for dad. \n\nDo you know how hard it is for an emotionally disregulated 7 year old who has been naughty all year to turn it around for 8 days consecutively? The answer is VERY. Tell me, why should he bother to be good from now on, if dad is going to punish him when he's bad AND when he's good?\n\nThis is such a disproportionate and inappropriate punishment for a 7 year old that I am gobsmacked. If he is naughty you punish him there and then, on the day, with an immediate and proportionate consequence. Not weeks later. Not months later. And NOT by cancelling an entire yearly holiday which for many kids (depending on what country you're in) is second only to Christmas, and which may now be tinged with bitterness and resentment for the rest of his childhood. \n\nThings which support the good behaviour of a 7 year old include praising him for good behaviour, spending quality time with him on a regular basis, and adding in additional activities and treats as a reward. You've just thrown away an excellent chance to do all three of these things.\n\n\nApologise to your son. Tell him you are proud of him for being good for a whole week and get such a good mark. And then put aside some time for him and dad to do something meaningful and talk about how you want him to keep up the good work.", "YTA.  That\u2019s too big of a consequence for the age and punishment for an 85% in a 1st or 2nd grade student is unheard of most places.", "YTA. \n\nGee, I wonder why your son acts out at age SEVEN.", "YTA. 7 is entirely too young for a punishment of this magnitude, Halloween is second only to Christmas for most kids. Plus it doesn't fit the \"crime\" of missing 5% on a quiz so it's just become punishment for punishment's sake. You're doing him and yourself a huge disservice by using this kind of discipline. You need to reward and punish based on effort, not just arbitrary rules you've come up with.", "YTA\n\nThe kid is seven!  And Halloween is just once a year.\n\nThere are reasonable consequences, and taking away Halloween because he got a B on a spelling test is not a reasonable consequence.  \n\nSeven year olds are little kids. they don't need \"harsh\" lessons, yet.  They need love, support, and gentle guidance.  \n\nIf a seven year old is acting out in school, odds are that something is going on there that is upsetting them and that isn't right.  You need to explore what is going on, not just punish.  \n\nHeck, when I was seven, my teacher told my parents I wasn't paying attention in class.  Turns out I needed glasses, and once I could see what was going on again, everything was fine.   You need to look for causes, for what is happening.", "YTA\n\nAn 85%. You're taking away an entire holiday over ***FIVE PERECENT***. \n\nAt SEVEN YEARS OLD. \n\nIf this was about his behavior, it'd be one thing, but you've made it very clear it's NOT. This is about him missing your near-impossible-for-a-seven-year-old standards by FIVE PERCENT. \n\nPeople like you are one of the biggest reasons children hate school, and one of the biggest reasons kids act out at school. Frankly, I'd be surprised if your kid's behavioral issues aren't **your** fault. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo better.", "YTA.  Never tie punishment to grades.  It sets the kid up for failure and/ or a nervous breakdown.  \n\nHis misbehavior?  Sure.

That was the biggest issue it seems since you said he severely misbehaved.  He behaved but didn't do as well as you would have liked. You could have compromised since he didn't fail and he did behave.  One thing I learned early as a parent  is that you have to pick and choose your battles and what hill to die on. You should have just let this one go.", "YTA", "YTA. First for putting unreasonable expectations on a 7 year old. 85% is a very respectable grade.\n\nDo the research... people succeed when supported and encouraged by rewarding good behavior.. it is called positive reinforcement.\nNegative reinforcement is the practice of punishing bad behavior. It doesn't work. \n\nAlso, you are starting the process of losing your child. He will grow into a man that will always remember this abuse. Think about the man you want to call your son, and think about your grandkids. You will have no contact with any of these people if you raise your son this way.", "YTA.\n\nThe point wasn\u2019t to get your son to get a 90, at least not allegedly. The point was to have him make an effort to improve in school.\n\nHe improved his behavior so much that he got compliments from his teachers. His behavior and grades improved dramatically.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why you harped on his grade. An exact grade shouldn\u2019t be the goal at seven. The goal should be teaching through positive reinforcement that working hard and improving should be rewarded, and that you see he is choosing to do both.\n\nInstead you showed him that changing his behavior doesn\u2019t matter at all if his can\u2019t get an A.", "Ugh. YTA. 85 is almost there. You could have been lenient. Also, YTA for giving him a score to reach instead of not rewarding his behavior, which seems like the bigger issue.", "YTA. Your comments say his behavior improved and he clearly tried hard on the test. I ended up being an A/B student in high school, multiple AP classes, an English degree, eventually a master's in my work field. You know what I vividly remember from elementary school? Struggling desperately on spelling tests and thinking I was stupid for not being able to do well on them. \n\nYour seven year old is trying. He's a baby! You gotta cut him some slack. It should be about improvement and effort, not numbers. If I were you I'd apologize and get him a little assortment of candy. You're setting up harsh standards, anxiety, and him comparing himself negatively with his sibling. What he learned is even if he tries, getting normal grades and behaving normally is still not good enough.\n\nLittle kids with behavior problems need real help. See if you can get him a counselor or therapist if it's really that bad.", "YTA", "YTA. He made a solid effort to improve his behaviour and achieved a great grade on his spelling test.

This was way to high a grade to set.\n\nBasically what happened here is you set your child up to fail. And you did so with a really high stakes event like Halloween that only comes once a year. He only has so many Halloweens as a kid to enjoy if he was going to miss it then it should be for a big thing not a minor fuck up. What you have taught your child is to not try. He did everything right, heck he even did it well. He behaved and he even got a good grade.

YTA. YTA.\n\nHe got an 85 instead of a 90 - that's a good grade and he obviously **put in the effort** but you didn't bother acknowledging that. \n\nNo wonder the poor kid has behavior problems - you expect perfection and he can't possibly meet your standards.", "YTA you dressed as the fun police for halloween.

I\u2019d be really curious what else you\u2019re doing to help your son other than depriving him of important core memories.", "Punishments should be at a level relevant to the crime. Too soft and they don't discourage the poor behaviour, too severe and they cause resentment. Denying your child to attending a really fun event that only happens once a year is quite a severe punishment for the crime of getting 85% in a test.\n\nThinking about it, why are you punishing a child for the school performance anyway? Punishments are supposed to be for bad behaviour. Is it behaviour related to get 85% instead instead of 90%? If he didn't try at all then perhaps but clearly he did try and wasn't good enough, so punishing him for that could make him give up or resent you and it's certainly not a recommended method of parenting. You should have left the condition of going trick or treating just behaviour related.", "YTA.  This isn't 1950!  Read a book about parenting.  Use positive reinforcement, not negative (except for rare occasions.)  Stop worrying so much about a frickin' 2nd grade spelling test too!

Practicing the words? Asking for help? If he didn\u2019t put in any effort I can see why you would choose to punish him, but if he worked towards getting an A on the test all that punishment is going to teach him is that his work and effort doesn\u2019t matter to you.

He\u2019s seven. He has some behavioural issues that clearly need some support, not punishment. And he really did do his best - he didn\u2019t get 85% just to piss you off.

You have severely unreasonable expectations regarding grades, especially for a seven year old. 85% may not be an A but it\u2019s still a great score and you should be proud of him instead of punishing him. If the behavior was the main issue behind his probation, why is his 85% such a big deal? Have you maybe considered that your apparent controlling behavior about his grades might be the reason he\u2019s acting up at school? Because that sure seems like a possibility.\n\nIt pisses me off to no end when parents treat any grade less than an A like a failure. Not having straight As all the time does not automatically mean your kid will never get into college or get a good job later in life.

Of course this is going to involve some behavioral shifts, as well as a learning curve for what\u2019s appropriate behavior in school vs at home.

Sure he didn\u2019t hit the exact metric you set but if he didn\u2019t get any bad reports from school and got 85% he was clearly trying. Kids only get so many halloweens. Also you say he\u2019s had issues at school all year where he chronically misbehaves and doesn\u2019t listen to teachers instructions, has your son been assessed for ADHD or a similar learning disability? My child was diagnosed around the same age and a small pill every day balanced him out, it was like night and day", "YTA, discipline is a learning style, it works differently for each and every child. Cancelling a once in a year event for your child because he got a question wrong on a test is not how you solve bad behaviour, in fact it makes it worse. His behaviour is most likely caused by you, your disciplinary style will most likely cause mental issues in the future (such as depression, anxiety, etc..). Your son clearly studied for the test and tried his best, yet even after his hard work you refused to acknowledge his achievements. Have you gotten him tested for a behavioural disorder? If not, get him assessed asap. The sooner you treat him the better. For the future, communicate with your son and try to understand how to give fair and proper punishments.", "YTA. As a parent, I understand that sometimes it can feel like you\u2019re out of options. But I can 100% guarantee that these types of over the top punishments will not make him a better speller and will probably make his behavioral problems even worse. Whatever authoritarian parenting you received, you need to learn a better way. A seven-year-old is not developmentally capable of stopping his behavior because of that time his Dad punished him harshly. Read about \u201crespectful parenting\u201c so that you don\u2019t have to come on AITA to figure out when you\u2019re using terrible parenting strategies.", "YTA. One thing is conseqences for bad behaviour, which I am on board with. But why on earth would you draw his spelling into the mix? Also YTA for thinking you can write the rules without the agreement of your wife! Shame on you!", "Imagine how hard he must have been working to go that long without a report about bad behavior when it\u2019s the norm. I really think you negated the effort he put in, and next time he might not bother if he doesn\u2019t think he can do it perfectly. My vote is YTA.", "YTA - you never should have tied the punishment to his spelling grade, when the issue was really his behavior. If his behavior is better, you should NOT have punished him for a spelling test that never should have been part of the equation.", "NAH. Tired of seeing all the YTA posts talking about how he didn't get to go trick-or-treating. He got to hand out candy and see how being on the other side works. He learned that it's not the end of the world. Hopefully he learned that sometimes it's better to give than receive.", "YTA what exactly did he do wrong, except not meet your expectations? I know that you set a standard for him to reach, but I don't think that standard is fair, and it's actually really arbitrary. It's one test, and he's seven; Halloween is once a year. One little 5-point mistake isn't equivalent to the punishment. Instead of creating a sweet memory for your son and you to share, you've alienated him and he'll remember that his father was a harsh authoritarian. He'll feel like he can never please you. Are you trying to teach him to be obey you like a trained poodle, or are you trying to teach him hard work gets rewarded?", "May I ask~did you work with your son on his spelling words before he took his test? Did you help him practice his spelling list throughout the week?", "YTA do you even LIKE your child??", "YTA you mentioned in another comment he got a great report from school that week, your child will remember this. I'm wondering if you are maybe one of the reasons for his behaviour problems.", "NTA - because he did not make the cut.  I also feel like he did get to participate in halloween by handing out candy.\n\nI think it is great that he is trying - he did do well on that test - and maybe you could reward that - go pick up some 50% off November 1 candy for him.\n\nMake sure that you are doing all that you can for him because he may be struggling, does he need outside help? is he getting the support he needs from his mom & dad?", "NTA. He knew the rules and he didn\u2019t live up to them. He will likely remember and fix his behavior now. Learning early that actions and behaviors have consequences, and that you will follow through, will prevent a LOT of problems later on.", "NTA!

I\u2019m betting you spend very little time with him. \n\nIn any event, you likely taught him that he may as well not try bc whatever he does, he\u2019ll never be good enough for you.\n\nEnjoy the next 11 years.

I've had plenty of students bust their butts in the last week or two of a term to raise their grade. Sometimes they fall a point or two short then they (and even their parents) say \"I've (they've) worked hard, can't I just acknowledge their hard work and bump them up.\"\n\nI always respond by praising their hard work and inform them that keeping that effort going forward will lead to more successful grades in the next term.

Shame on you.", "YTA, you are mixing multiple forms into the grand punishment, your making it about behaviour (go the week without a teachers note home about an incident) oh and you need to get 90 on your spelling test which is not behavioural but academic. I think the week without a report home was totally on par, however the spelling test was unnecessary, if it was the opposite that failing English was the issue the the spelling test would fit but the week without a report home would not fit.  \n\nAnother question is his acting up a 7 day a week thing or more school focused, perhaps he\u2019s not feeling challenged, or is bored, or perhaps he needs additional supports. Not all kids are the same, even between your daughter and son there will be immense differences which I\u2019m sure you see. You son may need support in other ways connected to how he learns best. What \u201cworked\u201d for us as kids may not work for your own kids. I\u2019m not saying they need to be coddled and spoon feed, however small things can make a big difference, example from my one 6 year old and I\u2019ve known it for years he leans best when he can move around. The classroom at his school is geared toward that they are in round tables rather than desks and it\u2019s been interesting to see the change in his information retention with that simple change that little bit of \u201cwiggle\u201d room both literal and figurative has made a world of difference.", "YTA. There's plenty of time for him to learn the harsh lessons of life, but for now he's a kid. Let him be a kid. And 85% on a spelling test is good score and it indicates that he tried. How much time did he spend practicing his words? Does he understand the words that he got wrong and why he needs to get better? Those are the metrics that are going to help him grow and improve, that are going to help him as he gets older. Not everyone learns or comprehends or tests at the same levels, so setting an arbitrary \"get 90% or else\" rule isn't actually going to accomplish anything - he may never be the kid who gets 90% on any test, and that's perfectly alright. Don't teach him to only be satisfied with perfection, because he'll end up chasing an illusion for his entire life.", "YTA", "I\u2019d have let the 85% go (that\u2019s so close, and he probably tried really hard for the 90%) YTA (unless he was still misbehaving at school, which you left unclear.

I\u2019m an elementary art teacher and there are a couple disrespectful kids I deal with who I\u2019d love to give a consequence they actually care about for a change. \n\nAs a teacher, I\u2019ll also say this - if his behavior at school improved after you made this deal with him and he still didn\u2019t get to go trick or treating? You\u2019re probably going to have even more problems now. Why would he bother trying to respect teachers now when he did so for the reward and he didn\u2019t even end up getting it?\n\nIf he\u2019s still being awful at school the punishment is fair.

He now knows the consequences...", "YTA. Dude, at 7 most kids don't misbehave out of sheer spite yet, his behavior might be an indication of some underlying psychological or even physiological problem. And 85/100 is a pretty good score.

Consequences should be related, reasonable, and respectful. If he has these behavior issues, it was probably really, really challenging for him to get that 85%.
