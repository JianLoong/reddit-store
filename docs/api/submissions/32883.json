He was young but had a bad heart and died in his sleep when he was 29. My mom remarried a couple of years later. She and her husband, my stepdad, met 7 months after my dad's death. They started dating after knowing each other for a few months. Then they got married. I should mention that they met through a grief support group. My mom's husband lost a child to stillbirth and his relationship fell apart.\n\nMy mom and her husband wanted me to look at him as another father in my life. I never saw him that way, not even when he and my mom had my half brother's together.\n\nI never hated my mom's husband. I go through a lot of mixed feelings about him. Sometimes I like him because I see he's a good husband to my mom and a good dad to my half brothers. Sometimes I dislike him for not respecting that I want to get along but do not want a fatherly relationship with him. I have never *loved* him. He has never gotten to be someone I consider actually important to me. I think because throughout the negative has always outweighed the positive. What doesn't help is he will often tell me he loves me but also goes into how he lost his bio daughter and that makes him love me more, and then he also brings up that losing my bio dad means I *need* someone else to fill that role. He told me a young child who loses a parent cannot decide they never get a new one. They need to do their best to make the relationship as close to the original one as passible. I have asked him if it isn't enough to just be friendly and on good terms.\n\nMy mom asked me before why I need to show more loyalty to my dad than to her and and her husband and why I can't let him in enough to be that second dad so everyone else can be happy. She told me she knows I would be happier if I had another person filling the role dad left behind. She said it doesn't mean he replaces dad but it means I also have a dad here.\n\nNow that I'm in my 20s and I'm engaged to be married. I asked my mom if she would walk me down the aisle at my wedding and she freaked out and told me I needed to ask my stepdad. She told me that asking her would crush him. Of course he walks in as she's still being very loud and when he realized what was going on he told me it would mean the world to him to fill the father of the bride role, and do both parts of walking me down the aisle and performing a father/daughter dance at the wedding. My mom pestered me about it for days afterward. So I asked if we could meet up and I told her I will give her what she wants but I need her to understand this is not for me, it's not what I want, it's not making me happy and it will not change how I feel about her husband, no matter how much she wants it to. But I told her if it's that important I will do it.\n\nShe called me manipulative for spewing all that before formally agreeing and told me I had managed to shit on my doing a good thing.

And you only want it for purely selfish reasons. You and Stepdad have been insanely selfish since the moment he came into my life. I was a grieving child, and instead of respecting my feelings and my autonomy, and letting a relationship form naturally, you forced me into a fake relationship with him. As a result, you made it impossible for me to love him because he doesn't really love me... At best, he loves the person he pretended I was (and guilt-tripped me every time I expressed my actual feelings) and at worst, he's still pretending I'm his dead kid.\"\n\nNTA. In your shoes, I'd probably reject both him and your mother as options to walk you down the aisle...that is supposed to be a moment where you feel love and support from your old life as you walk to meet your new life. The way you described it, I have a hard time believing that either of them will make you feel supported in that moment\n\nBut regardless of your decision, all you did was tell your mother the truth...a truth that she should have been fully aware of already. She's the AH for demanding you ask him, and she's even more of an AH for guilt-tripping you after you shared your feelings on her selfish request\n\nI'm so sorry that they treated you the way they did when you were growing up. You deserved so much better than that. The only ones responsible for the rift between you now is *them*, not you", "NTA, they haven\u2019t respected your boundaries your entire life.

Trust me when I say don\u2019t settle for anything on your wedding day for anyone aside from your partner. That\u2019s one of the most memorable days that you will talk about for years.

Instead I just gave him a father-daughter dance because it seemed less painful and easier to emotionally handle pictures.

It\u2019s not like you\u2019re being a jerk to your stepdad. Your wedding is supposed to be about you and what you and your spouse want. Period.

Regardless of what you think, this man has been in your life for 14 years and probably tried his best to be there for you growing up. I cannot understand why children harbor bad feelings towards stepparents that only try and do good for them. God knows there are plenty of stepchildren who would love to have a stepdad or mom who would treat them well and love them instead of beat and abuse them. It's just sad to me how some people who have good stepparents are so negative towards them when there are others who would give anything to have someone like that in their lives. I get that your father died, and you had a hard time, but sometimes someone else comes into our lives that can make a difference if they're given the chance, the problem is, if you've never been treated horrible by a parent or stepparent, you take these things for granted and look at it negatively when it could've been something special.", "wee bit YTA...

He was young but had a bad heart and died in his sleep when he was 29. My mom remarried a couple of years later. She and her husband, my stepdad, met 7 months after my dad's death. They started dating after knowing each other for a few months. Then they got married. I should mention that they met through a grief support group. My mom's husband lost a child to stillbirth and his relationship fell apart.\n\nMy mom and her husband wanted me to look at him as another father in my life. I never saw him that way, not even when he and my mom had my half brother's together.\n\nI never hated my mom's husband. I go through a lot of mixed feelings about him. Sometimes I like him because I see he's a good husband to my mom and a good dad to my half brothers. Sometimes I dislike him for not respecting that I want to get along but do not want a fatherly relationship with him. I have never *loved* him. He has never gotten to be someone I consider actually important to me. I think because throughout the negative has always outweighed the positive. What doesn't help is he will often tell me he loves me but also goes into how he lost his bio daughter and that makes him love me more, and then he also brings up that losing my bio dad means I *need* someone else to fill that role. He told me a young child who loses a parent cannot decide they never get a new one. They need to do their best to make the relationship as close to the original one as passible. I have asked him if it isn't enough to just be friendly and on good terms.\n\nMy mom asked me before why I need to show more loyalty to my dad than to her and and her husband and why I can't let him in enough to be that second dad so everyone else can be happy. She told me she knows I would be happier if I had another person filling the role dad left behind. She said it doesn't mean he replaces dad but it means I also have a dad here.\n\nNow that I'm in my 20s and I'm engaged to be married. I asked my mom if she would walk me down the aisle at my wedding and she freaked out and told me I needed to ask my stepdad. She told me that asking her would crush him. Of course he walks in as she's still being very loud and when he realized what was going on he told me it would mean the world to him to fill the father of the bride role, and do both parts of walking me down the aisle and performing a father/daughter dance at the wedding. My mom pestered me about it for days afterward. So I asked if we could meet up and I told her I will give her what she wants but I need her to understand this is not for me, it's not what I want, it's not making me happy and it will not change how I feel about her husband, no matter how much she wants it to. But I told her if it's that important I will do it.\n\nShe called me manipulative for spewing all that before formally agreeing and told me I had managed to shit on my doing a good thing.

She explicitly does NOT want to take the bio-Mom's place, but she's happy to mother them.\n\nI saw another story where the father of the bride started down the aisle and then stopped the bride, strode forward, grabbed his ex-wife's 2nd husband out of his seat to take the bride's other arm.

Our stepmom was very overly strict, and she made the rules, not dad.  He is a loving man, but really steps back and lets the woman run the show, apparently was like that with our bio mom too.  My sisters called her by her name all the rest of her life.  It wasn't until she was elderly and diagnosed with cancer that they called her Mom.  They still call her mom now after her death, however they still didn't LOVE her, they just did it out of respect.  Since I was 2 when she married my dad, to me she was my mom - she treated me the same as she did her bio kids, so my relationship was different to her than that of my sisters.  However, I can understand how you feel based on how my sister's felt.  It is perfectly understandable, you had a father you loved and you didn't want your stepfather to \"replace\" him.  Sounds like your mother wanted him to replace your father, which can never be done.  My sisters still talk of memories of our bio mom so that will never be erased from their memories just like your father will not.

Step parents can be pushy and not allow time for the relationship to develop properly, the children can be closed off and not give the step parent a proper chance and overlook the things that person does for them, and the biological parent will generally hold firm on one of those sides and not help facilitate and nurture a proper relationship to form.\n\nWhen it comes to building these relationships all adults need to allow the child to open up on their own terms,  the biological parent needs to help support them and make sure they understand that accepting someone doesn't erase their other parent.

Also - you could perhaps suggest that they both walk you down the aisle. That's what we did for our daughter.

I see your mother\u2019s point. you had a father, who passed away that fact you had a stepfather who offered nothing but love and you rejected him and you\u2019re still rejecting him. Why? it\u2019s not disloyal to your father, for all you know your father sent him to you. It sounds to me like you shut him out at every turn.

Or perhaps he and your mother and brothers can all walk you down the aisle, with a picture of your father. He is your family, like it or not. It sounds to me like you\u2019re acting like an ungrateful, rebellious teen trying to punish your mother and him by rejecting him at your wedding, in front of all your family and friends. When you have children, will they be told this is grandmas husband, or this is grandpa? Are you going to deny your children his love too?Have you considered that? Have you considered the fact that hurting him publicly at your wedding would have consequences in the future?

This is not about what you or he thinks he deserves.\n\nAs someone who has had experience as both a stepchild and a stepmother, I have learned that trying to force a familial relationship on a stepchild will usually make the relationship extremely strained. The OP has made it clear that the times she actually felt close to the guy were the times he stopped trying to force that bond. He might actually have had a chance to take on the father role if he had just let the relationship develop in its own time.

No one can force you to see him as a father figure and they should not have tried. The guilting over his daughter, trying to make you a replacement, is sickening. Just because he's a 'nice guy' and tried with you doesn't obligate you to see him as he wishes to be seen. For some of us, people who mean something to us aren't interchangeable or replaceable. This is just a different version of the friendzone shit where people (mostly guys) think they are entitled to the place they want in someone's life if act the right way. No one is owed the relationship they want with someone just because they want it, period. You get to decide what someone means to you and you are well within your rights to lay it out that while you will agree to things, it's not because you want it that way or they have finally 'won' and you'll accept him as a father figure. Personally, I'd walk myself down the isle. No one needs to give you away because they don't own you in the first place.

I don't understand this idea that being a stepparent rather than a \"real\" parent is somehow a downgrade. It's just a different role.\n\nI vote for asking your brothers to walk you down the aisle.

There was also a lot more early death due to health conditions that are now generally survivable. I\u2019m in my forties and I know multiple people my parents and grandparents ages that had this mentality and it was literally never questioned because \u201ca good man\u201d or \u201ca good woman\u201d was stepping up, and therefore they should be celebrated for their contribution. It\u2019s really permeated in to the core of how people perceive these situations. And it\u2019s time that we have a reckoning where enough surviving kids buck this publicly.

You don't have to love him, you don't have to call him dad, but I do think you have to respect what he has done for your family. \n\nI think the root of the problem is a lot bigger than you think. It seems you are still distraught and in disbelieve that your father has passed.
