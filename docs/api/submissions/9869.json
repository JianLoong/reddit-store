My ex and I were together for eight years before we got divorced when the kids had 7 and 5 years old. The circumstances of my divorce are complicated.\n\nAfter the divorce we got shared custody for a while that changed to her having the kids on weekdays and me having them on weekends when I had to move out far from their school. Still we had a relationship, although my relationship with my boys was severely damaged by the divorce. They told me they didn't liked to be with me because I made their mom cry. \n\nFive years after the divorce I met someone new who a year later became my wife (f35). She was a single mom of a daughter (f18). After that my kids started to complain more and more about coming home with me when I picked them up to the point they would only get in the car if I have brought them something. My ex took the opportunity to get back to me and she encouraged the kids to tell the judge that they didn't liked to be with me and to suspend my days with them. Apparently they said that the kids couldn't get used to the idea of having a step mom. The judge took my custody days off, I had to visit them in my ex's house if I wanted to see them. My kids said to my face that they hated me and hope to never see me again multiple times.\n\nMy wife and I have one son (m3) and I feel like my step daughter is my biological one, and she feels like I'm her dad too. We have a great relationship, she's the kindest girl ever. She's starting college next September. I offered to pay for her tuition and have already paid her first semester. \n\nSomehow my son found out about that and he came to my house after years to ask me how much money I have because he needs to know before starting looking for colleges (he's graduating next year) I asked him what made him think that I'm paying for his college, he said that he already knew I paid for step daughter's one. I told him that I'm not paying for his college tuition and that he shouldn't expect me to after ignoring me for years. I told him that after he turns 18 (which will happen before he graduates) he'll have his dream come true, I'll disappear from his life, unless he apologies that's what will happen. He called me all kind of names, then he must have told my ex because she came to my house to insult me and my wife too, I had to call the cops. \n\nWhat makes me think that I'm an asshole is that my ex called me \"petty\" and maybe she's right, it's kind of petty to do this to a kid, he probably doesn't know what's better for himself or doesn't have had lived enough to appreciate the things I've done for him.", "created_utc": 1676308314, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111ec7h/aita_for_paying_for_my_daughters_college_tuition/", "score": 447, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn't sound like you didn't try for them, but when it gets to the point where your teenage kids won't get in the car with you to go to your house, tell you they hate you and don't want to see you, tell the judge they don't like being around you... What else are you to do? You can't force them.\n\nAnd if they were happy to not be around you before and suddenly are coming around asking for thousands of dollars, that's pretty gross. I can't see how they expected you to pay it. And LOL that your ex, who almost certainly had a hand in turning the boys against you, would now be indignant that you won't pay for their college.

And you essentially have replaced your biological children and are in fact being petty.  However, if in the US, absent an agreement in the divorce proceeding, college tuition is not required in any state as part of child support.  Although your kids have apparently treated you badly (unclear on whether they are justified) your paying for your step-daughter feels very \u201ceff you I\u2019m replacing you.\u201d   That\u2019s where the AH judgement comes in for you.  \n\nYour kid not speaking to you for years and then demanding payment for his college is entitled behavior.  You are his dad apparently only for purposes of paying and that isn\u2019t right either.  You are a cash pi\u00f1ata to them and that makes him and his mom the AH here.  If you aren\u2019t good enough for even weekend visits, you shouldn\u2019t be good enough to help pay for college.

Also this could provide a good bridge for future relationship with your son. So yeah\u2026nta but I would encourage you to reflect on what is motivating you to say no. He never stopped being your son, that love and thus the care attached to it are supposed to be without conditions. Take advantage of the fact that he\u2019s now coming around and weasel your way into a relationship with him now! It may be an ideal time because he\u2019ll be less influenced by your ex.

This is really sad and shows how bad parental alienation can be.\n\nWith the way things are and seem to be heading, it's unlikely you'll ever be able to build an honest familial relationship with your sons. They've had a decade of being told how awful you are. They've been told your the villain constantly.  This won't change the image they have of you.  Would paying their tuition mend things? Maybe, maybe not (as long as they're being fed lies against you, it will not).  If you want to try for a future relationship, you have to somehow make sure they know there's a path to redemption (both for you in their eyes, and them in yours). \n\nYour ex is the true asshole in this story.

No wonder your kids don't want to talk to you.", "YTA\nHe was a child when he said all those things to you. He had no idea what was going on. To him his world got turned upside down. Of course he would say mean things at that age. All he knew was mom and dad got divorced and he blames you. Probably rightfully so. But you are the adult/parent regardless of what he said/did, it was your job to be there for them and you weren't.\n\nI get that he's 17 now and probably could've approached the subject of paying for college differently. But whats done is done. But man your reaction was VERY BAD.", "ESH. It sounds like you were treated horribly, but as a child of divorce myself I can attest that the pressure to please your parents is intense. Your sons clearly treated you badly but holding them responsible for attitudes they had as small children feels harsh. They were not responsible for them: your ex was. Be angry at her. As they become adults, you have the chance to re-establish independent relationships with them. Being involved in their education could be part of it. It sounds like you weren\u2019t consulted on expectations and it would be to everyone\u2019s advantage to clarify what you can and can\u2019t do, but if you just punish them for sticking by their primary caregiver in a horrible situation you\u2019re just perpetuating the estrangement. You are an \u201casshole\u201d if you write them off without explaining this all to them in a way that appreciated the position they were in, they\u2019re assholes for expecting you to be a checkbook without emotions, and your ex is an asshole for turning your kids against you. I\u2019m sorry for you: this sounds awful.", "YTA. You, an adult parent, are being petty against your hurt and growing child. \n\nYou say the divorce was complicated and won\u2019t elaborate, that usually means you were the \u201cbad guy.\u201d Then you moved so far away from your own children that they could only see you on weekends? Super caring choice, there. Then your sons were 10 and 12 when you got remarried, thats a grumpy age, of course they were difficult. It doesn\u2019t sound like you tried to do anything to build your relationship with them. All I\u2019m reading here is that you and your ex wife got a divorce, your sons didn\u2019t blindly follow you, they were salty and wary, and rather than doubling down and trying harder to be a father, you said eff it and moved on to your next family, adopting this step daughter because you had never made *her* mother cry, so she only sees you as a hero.\n\nEdit to add, pressed post too soon: \nThis is an opportunity to show up in your son\u2019s life, and rather than take it, you\u2019re punishing him.

I think you need to have a neutral third-party sit down and mediate the conversation between you guys because you said your daughter and one of your response comments posted it on social media. I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s the case because your son came directly to you. And I\u2019m not trying to speak anything negative here is it possible that your stepdaughter\u2019s been bullying your son? And this is probably something he snapped on? There\u2019s plenty of angles, but one thing is for sure you need to get into therapy, but both your son and your daughter that you have with your ex have a neutral third-party take them, but you need to sit down with them as they are father and talk to them. It\u2019s never too late to start reconciliation and I wanna make that clear. It\u2019s never too late. But y\u2019all need therapy. Lots of it. I do think what you said was an OK but I think you need to redirect your anger and your disappointment at your ex-wife because she is the cause of all of this. I think that\u2019s what your anger needs to be. But I do have to say you have to take it in and on the fall of what you said to your son, because even though he may not have nothing to do with you, you\u2019re still his dad and the fact that he came to your house come on yeah  you and the kids need to get into therapy OK. And based off of his reaction, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to fund your stepdaughter\u2019s tuition even though she may look at you as her dad, she may be bullying him with that factor. I mean I\u2019m just an Internet stranger I don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s the kind of cues  that I\u2019m picking up on. So I wouldn\u2019t pay for her college. I wouldn\u2019t do that. You could help your son pay for college you can help him pay for it help him get on like a payment plan and stuff like that same thing with your stepdaughter they\u2019re basically the same age you know, financial literacy those lessons can be good for both. Don\u2019t fund hers", "You seem unhinged. You don't know everything and you don't know the OP, so who cares what you think? It may be hard to believe but sometimes these things just happen.", "How the fuck did you manage to read the post from way up there on your high horse?", "That's creepy. If kids are old enough to decide, their decisions should be respected. Pushing boundaries and forcing himself on kids who don't want him is over the top.", "So you are cool with stalking.", "[deleted]", "And apparently rich enough to afford to have a lawyer fight for 18+ years. Some people aren\u2019t. They can\u2019t do appeal after appeal after appeal and new case after new case non stop. They also cant \u201cborrow and beg\u201d for money to do that either. Eventually that well dries up as well, then what? Going to scold the father for not kidnapping his own kids?", "He literally mentions it all over his comments. You are just not looking for it and assuming the worst.", "You might need to check your reading comprehension lol. He literally stated it in the overview and directly in the reply to your comment. The wife (his abuser) committed parental alienation. \n\nFrom OP: My ex took the opportunity to get back to me and she encouraged the kids to tell the judge that they didn't liked to be with me and to suspend my days with them. Apparently they said that the kids couldn't get used to the idea of having a step mom. The judge took my custody days off, I had to visit them in my ex's house if I wanted to see them. My kids said to my face that they hated me and hope to never see me again multiple times.", "I had no characters left, can I edit the post now or it won't let me? Sorry I'm new here", "Right exactly. We could be wrong with our suspicions. I because the son knew where he lived and he said that he had no contact then how did he know where he lived? Do you know what I mean? It\u2019s just like I don\u2019t want it to appear like I\u2019m bullying this person or anything it\u2019s not that at all I just have a few questions.", "Sorry. Sarcasm. Edited.", "I was thinking the stepdaughter might have said something to the son as well!", "Yeah, sometimes they do, but it's extremely rare. I'm willing to take the downvotes here, and I can certainly be wrong, that's certainly true. \n\nBut the general truth is that the courts don't restrict someone to supervise parenting time, regardless of gender, unless they have a reason.\n\nBut I also want to point out that perhaps it is the adult deliberately trying to spite there barely adult child, *because* they allege the child was manipulated that gives me the vibe that perhaps he is in telling the whole truth here.\n\nIt seems far more likely in this scenario, based on that, that he's not telling the whole story.", "Took the ladder.", "they were at the very least 12 and 10 by the time OP got married, presumably older by the time the court date took place because in most countries, kids under a certain age aren't legally allowed to choose which parent to live with. lose the creepy mindset", "They were 7 and 5.", "How is fighting for the kids stalking?", "We'll have to agree to disagree.", "Yes, op could say the truth and maybe he is really NTA  but i can\u2019t judge him if i don\u2019t have full answers to these questions. \n\nIf he has no contact with his son and his son don\u2019t know where he lives then how could he find him? That makes no sense", "I wasn't talking about you jrm1102. \n\nI meant GrumpyBearBank.", "Because his reaction is totally off-the-wall she had to say something. I mean I\u2019m not in their family I don\u2019t know. But that\u2019s just cues I\u2019m picking up on.. and I said to him don\u2019t pay for her college if you\u2019re not gonna pay for your sons they\u2019re both the same age teach them financial literacy payment plans, how to make stuff on time you know a learning experience. But he needs to get him and his daughter who he shares with his ex into therapy like now.", "And OP has mentioned an evolving custody arrangement with lawyers and judges etc. \n\nDont over simplify the post to try and win an argument.", "It is the mindset of never knowing when to stop. They fought absurdly hard, they lost, and their kids wanted nothing to do with them. They have a life and a future outside of this. Also tons of stories on AITA of kids cutting off their parents and their parents continuing to harass them... this subreddit does not look kindly on those parents either.", "Right. That\u2019s why I have questions and that\u2019s why I\u2019m a little suspicious.", "So adding the 5 years plus possible 1 extra they were 13 and 11 at the point of cutting him out.", "I guess that's up to each individual to decide but should expect an eventual explosive outcome at some point.", "Go read OPs comments, he tried to fight and it didnt work. The kids were clearly turned against him."]}
