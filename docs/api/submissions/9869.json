My ex and I were together for eight years before we got divorced when the kids had 7 and 5 years old. The circumstances of my divorce are complicated.\n\nAfter the divorce we got shared custody for a while that changed to her having the kids on weekdays and me having them on weekends when I had to move out far from their school. Still we had a relationship, although my relationship with my boys was severely damaged by the divorce. They told me they didn't liked to be with me because I made their mom cry. \n\nFive years after the divorce I met someone new who a year later became my wife (f35). She was a single mom of a daughter (f18). After that my kids started to complain more and more about coming home with me when I picked them up to the point they would only get in the car if I have brought them something. My ex took the opportunity to get back to me and she encouraged the kids to tell the judge that they didn't liked to be with me and to suspend my days with them. Apparently they said that the kids couldn't get used to the idea of having a step mom. The judge took my custody days off, I had to visit them in my ex's house if I wanted to see them. My kids said to my face that they hated me and hope to never see me again multiple times.\n\nMy wife and I have one son (m3) and I feel like my step daughter is my biological one, and she feels like I'm her dad too. We have a great relationship, she's the kindest girl ever. She's starting college next September. I offered to pay for her tuition and have already paid her first semester. \n\nSomehow my son found out about that and he came to my house after years to ask me how much money I have because he needs to know before starting looking for colleges (he's graduating next year) I asked him what made him think that I'm paying for his college, he said that he already knew I paid for step daughter's one. I told him that I'm not paying for his college tuition and that he shouldn't expect me to after ignoring me for years. I told him that after he turns 18 (which will happen before he graduates) he'll have his dream come true, I'll disappear from his life, unless he apologies that's what will happen. He called me all kind of names, then he must have told my ex because she came to my house to insult me and my wife too, I had to call the cops. \n\nWhat makes me think that I'm an asshole is that my ex called me \"petty\" and maybe she's right, it's kind of petty to do this to a kid, he probably doesn't know what's better for himself or doesn't have had lived enough to appreciate the things I've done for him.", "created_utc": 1676308314, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/111ec7h/aita_for_paying_for_my_daughters_college_tuition/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It doesn't sound like you didn't try for them, but when it gets to the point where your teenage kids won't get in the car with you to go to your house, tell you they hate you and don't want to see you, tell the judge they don't like being around you... What else are you to do? You can't force them.\n\nAnd if they were happy to not be around you before and suddenly are coming around asking for thousands of dollars, that's pretty gross. I can't see how they expected you to pay it. And LOL that your ex, who almost certainly had a hand in turning the boys against you, would now be indignant that you won't pay for their college. She made the bed, time to lie in it.", "Your son decided to not continue a relationship with you, but then expects you to help pay for his college?\n\nHe can't have it both ways.\n\nNTA", "NTA, and I fully disagree with those in the comments that seem to think that it's a kid's birth right to walk all over their parents.. some idiot actually said that parents don't get to enjoy the luxury of hurt feelings..? What the fuck?", "\" I'm not paying for his college tuition and that he shouldn't expect me to after ignoring me for years.\"\n\nBingo.  NTA", "Yes, you are a terrible, terrible asshole. You say that your son has been \"ignoring you for years.\" He's 17 now. So what, you're refusing to fund your offspring's education because of decisions he made when he was 11? 9? After you started the estrangement rolling by moving far enough away that you could only see them on the weekends? After not visiting them at their mother's house? And then telling a 17 year old child that you can't wait to disappear from his life? You sound small, petty, and about as in control of your emotions as a toddler. YTA.", "NTA - he picked his side of the fence now he should die on it or he could apologize, If he really cared about his college tuition, tbh the really asshole is the adult mother spewing hate to her kids, get a restraining order", "ESH - you are an adult.  And you essentially have replaced your biological children and are in fact being petty.  However, if in the US, absent an agreement in the divorce proceeding, college tuition is not required in any state as part of child support.  Although your kids have apparently treated you badly (unclear on whether they are justified) your paying for your step-daughter feels very \u201ceff you I\u2019m replacing you.\u201d   That\u2019s where the AH judgement comes in for you.  \n\nYour kid not speaking to you for years and then demanding payment for his college is entitled behavior.  You are his dad apparently only for purposes of paying and that isn\u2019t right either.  You are a cash pi\u00f1ata to them and that makes him and his mom the AH here.  If you aren\u2019t good enough for even weekend visits, you shouldn\u2019t be good enough to help pay for college.  They are AHs as a result.  \n\nIn sum, the only reason I think you an AH is you appear to be replacing your kids and that isn\u2019t right even though they hurt you.  You are their Dad and for all we know, you aren\u2019t blameless in the alienation from your kids.  \n\nSo ESH.", "YTA I\u2019m gonna go out on limb and say the circumstances around the divorce are not the complicated and you hurt your children in the process.

Your kids are learning a valuable lesson that actions have consequences.", "NTA - but the sons were probably alienated by their mom so they may not be at fault.", "NTA.

Also this could provide a good bridge for future relationship with your son. So yeah\u2026nta but I would encourage you to reflect on what is motivating you to say no. He never stopped being your son, that love and thus the care attached to it are supposed to be without conditions. Take advantage of the fact that he\u2019s now coming around and weasel your way into a relationship with him now! It may be an ideal time because he\u2019ll be less influenced by your ex. Maybe the uni might even have access to counselling that would benefit you both. Best of luck to you.", "NTA. This is really sad and shows how bad parental alienation can be.\n\nWith the way things are and seem to be heading, it's unlikely you'll ever be able to build an honest familial relationship with your sons. They've had a decade of being told how awful you are. They've been told your the villain constantly.  This won't change the image they have of you.  Would paying their tuition mend things? Maybe, maybe not (as long as they're being fed lies against you, it will not).  If you want to try for a future relationship, you have to somehow make sure they know there's a path to redemption (both for you in their eyes, and them in yours). \n\nYour ex is the true asshole in this story. The boys suffered by not having a relationship with their father growing up, and now they're going to suffer from not having support from you. It was her vile actions that drove this. I'm sorry for all of you for having to deal with it.", "NTA - assuming you did all you could to be a part of those kids lives. If they really after that want nothing to do with you, you arent obligated to pay for their college.\n\nThis doesnt mean that you arent completely blameless here, but no - you dont have to pay for college.", "NTA Why would you give someone that doesn't like you or want to be in your life money?", "Info:  what do you mean, the divorce was complicated?    Should we assume you cheated on your wife and destroyed your family?    You certainly didn't waste time moving far away from your children.   \n\n\n  \nI'm getting major missing missing reasons vibes from you and I strongly suspect you're a giant asshole.", "NTA- for the not paying for college question.

With 10 years you really already have an opinion and you already make many choices yourself.\n\nReading your answers you did try to keep a bond, but the boys pushed you away(with help of indoctrination of ex wife I think)\n\nThey(ex and kids) can't kick you to the curb and then years later expect a fat check", "YTA you got a second chance and you\u2019re squandering it. Parents don\u2019t really have the luxury of hurt feelings IMO. Your children were thrust into multiple situations beyond their control and it sounds like you didn\u2019t fight for them very much. I\u2019m sure THEIR feelings are very hurt.", "Nta\n\nEducation is not a given in the United States.  You're not required to pay a dime unless your custody agreement has college as part of the settlement. \n\n\nI won't judge based on the relationship you have with your children, but you should have fought harder.", "YTA\n\nYour reasoning boils down to I like my new family better. \n\nMan your relationship with your sons is fucked and   you seem to be a major cause.\n\nYou clearly got what you wanted. Which is a new family and to escape from your own children. Btw kids don\u2019t always process divorce well. Because they are children. Maybe understand that", "ESH. \nYTA:You should have fought harder for your kids (based on the info you provided). So what if you have to visit your exs house? You also don't treat your children the same.\n\nYour EX: is AH, because it sounds like she brainwashed your sons and ruined your relationship with them. This situation isn't uncommon in divorce sadly.\n\nYour son: is an AH because he's blindly entitled.", "YTA. No wonder your kids don't want to talk to you.", "YTA\nHe was a child when he said all those things to you. He had no idea what was going on. To him his world got turned upside down. Of course he would say mean things at that age. All he knew was mom and dad got divorced and he blames you. Probably rightfully so. But you are the adult/parent regardless of what he said/did, it was your job to be there for them and you weren't.\n\nI get that he's 17 now and probably could've approached the subject of paying for college differently. But whats done is done. But man your reaction was VERY BAD.", "ESH. It sounds like you were treated horribly, but as a child of divorce myself I can attest that the pressure to please your parents is intense. Your sons clearly treated you badly but holding them responsible for attitudes they had as small children feels harsh. They were not responsible for them: your ex was. Be angry at her. As they become adults, you have the chance to re-establish independent relationships with them. Being involved in their education could be part of it. It sounds like you weren\u2019t consulted on expectations and it would be to everyone\u2019s advantage to clarify what you can and can\u2019t do, but if you just punish them for sticking by their primary caregiver in a horrible situation you\u2019re just perpetuating the estrangement. You are an \u201casshole\u201d if you write them off without explaining this all to them in a way that appreciated the position they were in, they\u2019re assholes for expecting you to be a checkbook without emotions, and your ex is an asshole for turning your kids against you. I\u2019m sorry for you: this sounds awful.", "YTA. You, an adult parent, are being petty against your hurt and growing child. \n\nYou say the divorce was complicated and won\u2019t elaborate, that usually means you were the \u201cbad guy.\u201d Then you moved so far away from your own children that they could only see you on weekends? Super caring choice, there. Then your sons were 10 and 12 when you got remarried, thats a grumpy age, of course they were difficult. It doesn\u2019t sound like you tried to do anything to build your relationship with them. All I\u2019m reading here is that you and your ex wife got a divorce, your sons didn\u2019t blindly follow you, they were salty and wary, and rather than doubling down and trying harder to be a father, you said eff it and moved on to your next family, adopting this step daughter because you had never made *her* mother cry, so she only sees you as a hero.\n\nEdit to add, pressed post too soon: \nThis is an opportunity to show up in your son\u2019s life, and rather than take it, you\u2019re punishing him. You sound like someone who doesn\u2019t care about family, you only care about being right. That is really sad.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know this because I was in this situation as a child and based on my experience in the legal field.  Literally, custody is whatever  is in the best interest of the child.\n\nBut I do agree with you, that there is more going on. What did the kids say that created the need for supervised visits?", "NTA i dlnt think you should pay him college to a kid who was entirely rude to you amd kicked you lut of his life. Seems like he just wants your money. World doesnt work like that", "Woof that sucks, I am so sorry about your DV from your wife, that is so scary! \n\nStill though, I don\u2019t think you will be proud of your behavior in a few decades Re your sons. \n\nPicture this: you\u2019re on a rocking chair, thinking back to 2023. Are you surrounded by all your kids and grandkids, with your sons debt free in good jobs etc. After having a few awkward conversations about how you feel you\u2019re being treated and how they felt a little abandoned? \n\nOr are you proud that you showed them who is boss, and now you have no relationship with them. It\u2019s just your step daughter and grandkids puttering in the living room behind you?", "Sounds like he had a lawyer, and still lost\u2026 \n\nHis sons were at the age where a judge would take their emotions into account for custody, and their emotions led him to no custody and barely being able to see them.\n\nWhile I understand they were at a young age, at the end of the day even approaching 18, they still didn\u2019t want him in their life. They made their bed, now they can lay in it\n\nOnce they saw money, they came running. NTA OP", "You do realize that sometimes even with a good lawyer and a soul crushing fight that a person can still lose?", "I had the bestest lawyer I was able to pay", "Don't give those kids a penny. They decided to not have you in their lives. The entitlement to actually approach you asking for money....wow.", "It would take physical force to separate me from my kids.    I don't buy what this guy is selling tbh", "We tried but it did not worked out. Sometimes is very hard to prove that and the kids were very convinced about not liking to be in my house.", "He could be surrounded by his grandkids from his stepdaughter so that doesn't really apply.", "This is AITA, where every divorced man is at fault.  Even when he was being physically abused by his wife because he must have done something to serve it. /s\n\nEvery now and then I come back to this sub and each time it gets worse and worse.  I swear it has just become a sub for assholes to validate each other on their terrible behavior.", "Right, that is why I said \u201cit\u2019s just your step daughter and grandkids puttering in the lr behind you.\u201d\n\nAs in like\u2026 his grandkids from his stepdaughter."]}
