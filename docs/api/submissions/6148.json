My baby shower is coming up next Saturday. Ever since I was a kid I always thought that having baby showers be women only was not only dumb but also reinforced the idea that women are the main/sole person responsible for the children. My husband and I are partners 100% and he deserves to be celebrated as an upcoming parent as much as I do so we decided that the baby shower would be co-ed. I didn\u2019t get a real wedding or bridal shower because of Covid and this is the only really \u201cimportant milestone\u201d party I\u2019m ever going to get so it means a LOT to me. But literally only ONE male in my life (my BIL that I\u2019ve only met twice) other than my husband is even willing to come. \n\nEven my own father is refusing to come even though I\u2019ve made it very clear that this is extremely important to me. My best friend, male, I went to his all male bachelor party even though it was awkward as hell when I barely knew him because he asked me to. I have gone to MULTIPLE drag performances for his husband which I had to pay out of pocket to attend because I wanted to be supportive. I\u2019ve never asked him to come to ANYTHING for me and I made it pretty clear how important this was to me and he still refuses to come because \u201ca baby shower is for women\u201d. I\u2019ve tried to make it clear that this won\u2019t be a traditional baby shower with like the corny games and stuff it\u2019s more like a regular party. I am very hurt and saddened and feel like none of these men in my life even really care about me. How could they understand how important this is to me and still refuse to come simply because of toxic masculinity? I\u2019m not more important than that to them? \n\nI\u2019ve been crying about it for days because most of the people I REALLY cared about being there are male and refuse to come I\u2019ve made it clear to these people how much they have hurt my feelings and I\u2019m gonna be honest I\u2019ve been a bit emotional-outburst at them about the whole situation. My best friend texted me last night and I refused to even answer because I feel like if he refuses to be there for me why should I be there emotionally for him? It\u2019s not that they can\u2019t go\u2026they just won\u2019t. Everyone in my life (outside of my husband) is telling me that I am in the wrong for being hurt/rude about this because \u201cyou can\u2019t blame them for not wanting to go to a women\u2019s event\u201d and \u201cthey aren\u2019t gay sooo\u201d (which my BF is but I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s relevant?) so AITA here?", "created_utc": 1672504260, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzxtxq/aita_for_being_hurt_that_my_familyfriends_wont/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I loathe sports and never watch them at all, but I attended both of my sisters\u2019 volleyball games when they were in high school whenever my work schedule permitted. I also don\u2019t enjoy bridal or baby showers, but I attend or even organize them for friends and family, because it\u2019s important to the guest of honor.

There were more guys than girls, and I loved it.  Honestly, the shower was really more for my husband than me (I\u2019m an introvert, and this was his first baby).  All the most macho martial artists I\u2019ve ever met showed up, chowed down, goofed around, brought more presents than I\u2019ve ever seen and celebrated my husband becoming a dad, complete with dad jokes and good natured harassment.  \nThe idea guys can\u2019t come to a shower is antiquated and dumb.", "NTA I had a baby shower earlier this year and having a female only one didn't even cross my mind.

Sounds like they are users that have no intention of giving anything back. They have shown you who they are and what you don't mean to them. Believe them. I'd cut off the help and support from my end from here on out.

I\u2019m a woman and I can\u2019t stand baby showers - you have to realize while this is huge upcoming milestone for you and your husband, to others it really isn\u2019t a big deal and can be quite disinteresting.

It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they don\u2019t care about you, but to many people pregnancy and babies are just boring. \n\nCrying over it for several days is a bit much, talk to them about your feelings, hear theirs, and then you need to accept it and move on.

He actually enjoyed the party.", "NAH pretty much no one actually wants to go to showers. Women typically go because it\u2019s a reciprocal thing.

What are you going to do when there are real problems?", "NTA - the petty part of me wants to tell you to start ascribing gender to everything they do. That's the part of me who got 5 hours of sleep.

I am having a baby and would like to celebrate that with the people I love, of any and all genders. I love you. I am very disappointed and hurt that you are choosing archaic gender norms over me and my growing family. I hope you will reconsider, for the sake of our relationship, if nothing else. If not, please know I do not understand and I will be deeply hurt by your absence.\"\n\nIt's all I statements and it's true. Is it guilting them? Only if they're doing something they should feel guilty about (they should). It sounds like they just don't want to go to a baby shower and honestly, I'm 50/50 on ever going to them, but I know it makes the parents-to-be happy and those people matter to me, so I show up. Kids birthdays are headache-inducing nightmares to me after a couple hours, but I still show up for at least an hour and make sure the birthday kid knows they are loved by me. \n\nSide note: please do not rely on any of these men for childcare or support during the pregnancy and with your child.

We are old and still live in the past I suppose. I think you are right to have who you  want at your shower. I think in the past a girlfriend was the person to invite and throw the party. In my day it would have been a surprise party of sorts. I think a lot of change has been made over the last 50+ years and some keep with the old ways. It might be time for a change since the baby is both. If I was to throw a baby shower it would be all women because I am old and that is how I was raised.

This was because of distance, keeping my kid away from a lot of people before they have the immune system to handle it, and because I knew my c-section was going to make it hard for me to physically do the things I wanted to do for a while.

You don't have to agree, but those things are powerful. OP seems to feel the same way.\n\nDid my excitement about that celebration take away from my excitement to be a mom? If so, why?

I like her and if that involves me having to guess what type of food a stain on a onesie is from so be it. I *can* show up for someone I care about so I'm *going* to show up for someone I care about.
