His mom and twin sister tragically passed away when he was born, and his dad wrongly blamed him for it. It got even worse when his beloved grandparents, who tried to shield him, passed away when he was eight. His father continued to heap blame on him.  \nFast forward to when we met. He was in the process of healing, finally away from his dad and receiving therapy. It was a massive fear of his that he might have been responsible for all those losses.  \nNow, let's fast forward to January 2020. We were expecting a child, and the worst happened - I had a miscarriage. My husband, who was starting to unravel emotionally, went through a breakdown. He was hysterical, laughing and sobbing at the same time, and had to be physically restrained by medical staff. It was genuinely terrifying for both of us, and my family witnessed it.  \nHowever, instead of understanding his traumatic history and mental health crisis, my family judged him for \"laughing\" at the miscarriage. When they informed the rest of my family, they, too, passed judgment. It was hurtful considering he had shared his traumatic history with them years ago.  \nAs a result, they cut ties with my husband, saying he was not the kind of person they wanted around their kids. I decided to stand by him.  \nFast forward again to my niece's 12th birthday party. She called us, upset that she hadn't seen us on the guest list. I explained that we couldn't attend, and she asked why we were never around. I told her that her uncle, my husband, was not welcome anymore. She was understandably upset and confronted her parents and mine. Then I received backlash from my family for telling her about the situation.  \nSo, the big question is, am I the asshole for telling my niece the truth? Did I overstep my boundaries by sharing something that may have been too much for her to handle?  \nYour honest thoughts would be greatly appreciated.", "created_utc": 1698142611, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17f9e8b/aita_for_telling_my_niece_the_truth/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The action in the that could be judged is telling the niece about her uncle's situation and the family's rejection of him.\n2.

And if they were this much better than your husband as they seem to belive, they wouldn't have caused drama while you're still healing physically and mentally from a miscarriage.\n\nPeople have different ways to deal with shock, once my little sister was hit by a car in front of me while we got off the school bus, she was like 8 and I was 12, I was supposed to hold her hand so we can cross the street home but for some reason she took off running before I could stop her, and while strangers and the driver were seeing if she was okay and helping her get up, I was just standing there and laughing so hard like it was the funniest joke ever, not because I'm an evil witch that hated her, I love my sister, but I was so fucking scared that my brain just wasn't working anymore, it was so empty that I didn't even realize what I was doing, and I don't have any kind of trauma like your husband, she ended up uninjured thank god but I didn't know that at the moment, so you've got the idea.\n\nEDITED", "I\u2019m not sure what you we\u2019re supposed to do, so I\u2019m going NTA.
