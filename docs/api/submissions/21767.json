We got randomly matched to be roommates in college and we hit it off pretty well and I\u2019ve been friends with him since. After we left the dorms we got a place close to campus together. \n\nTom met a woman (21F) (we\u2019ll call Sally) about a year and a half ago and she\u2019s been great. T isn\u2019t the most neat and orderly person but she\u2019s whipped him into shape pretty quickly. \n\nOver time Sally and I became friends, we have a lot of common interests and talk whenever we get a second to catch up. She loves puzzles and these ice cream treats called Dibbs. \n\nUnfortunately school is now over and I\u2019ve got my degree so it\u2019s time to move on. I figured that before I left I should get my friends a gift. I\u2019ve never been great at verbally expressing how I feel because it makes me uncomfortable and giving a gift is the best way I know how to do it.\n\nI bought Tom a pocket knife and a sharpener and I bought Sally a big puzzle and a pack of the ice cream she liked. \n\nShe was really excited and gave me a hug. Tom thanked me for the gift but seemed a little off. \n\nLater on he said he wanted to talk to me and he chewed me out for \u201ctrying to make him look bad\u201c \n\nTom is less financially secure than myself so he doesn\u2019t have a lot of money to spend on S. The gifts weren\u2019t anything super expensive. \n\nI continually try to assure him that there is no ulterior motive to the gift but that I just wanted to thank them for being good friends to me.\n\nUnfortunately my mind tends to wander and looking back I\u2019m not entirely sure that it was appropriate. I\u2019m just looking for opinions. Do you think that I was out of line? \n\nI would also like to be clear about something, I have never seen Sally as a potential romantic partner. It is always been a purely platonic friendship.\n\nTLDR: I bought my friends from college presents before I move out and my friend got mad that I bought his girlfriend some thing because he thought that I was trying to make him look bad.", "created_utc": 1688911347, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14uzcy9/aita_for_buying_my_friends_gf_a_gift/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The gifts you chose were thoughtful and not extravagant. \n\nIt's unfortunate that your friend took it the wrong way and accused you of trying to make him look bad. You made it clear that your friendship with Sally is purely platonic, so there should be no reason for him to feel threatened. It's important for him to understand that giving gifts is a way to express gratitude and not a competition. \n\nHopefully, he will realize this and apologize for overreacting.", "NTA, especially since you were friends too getting her a gift shouldn't be an issue.", "NTA You bought Sally a puzzle book and ice cream and your friend is upset. \nThis was a goodbye gift.

Tom is unfortunately taking his insecurities out on you. Only gifting her something and not him, or gifting lingerie would have been inappropriate, but a puzzle and ice cream is perfectly sweet.", "NTA. You didn't go out of your way to get her a gift, it was a sweet gesture. Tom is simply insecure which is why he thinks that you made him look bad.", "NTA I think they were nice gifts, not too extravagant and thoughtful.
