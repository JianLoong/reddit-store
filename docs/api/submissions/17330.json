First of all, plenty of single dads wash their hands of the \u201cgirl stuff\u201d entirely, so **GOOD FOR YOU, SIR.** Second, parental honorifics are automatically bestowed upon adults when their children are born, but the true measure of those honorifics is what your children do with them as they get older. It would be different if you lobbied your daughter for the \u201cDad/Mom\u201d title, or if you had somehow pressured her to honor you on Mother\u2019s Day, but if your daughter organically appreciates your parenting efforts to that degree, then you\u2019ve earned any accolades she sees fit to give you. Your sister is not only being dismissive of your parenting, she\u2019s being dismissive of her niece\u2019s right to express her gratitude as she sees fit. I give you kudos for your excellent parenting, and I think your sister is an asshole for gatekeeping your daughter\u2019s gratitude.", "NTA. Your daughter obviously appreciates your efforts, and you sound like a great dad. Keep it up fella, and never let anyone put you down.", "NTA. Coming from a single parent family myself, I used to celebrate my mom for Father's Day because she took on both roles for me growing up. Your sister can shove it. Don't worry about her negativity. Be grateful you have a daughter who is so appreciate of all you do for her!", "**NTA.** Your daughter can celebrate her dad-mom (love it!) on any god damn day she wants and it's no one's business but yours. You sound like an awesome parent, good job.\n\nI find it ironic that (according to your sister) it's okay for her to be included (an Aunt), but not you (a Dad). Talk about 'rules for thee, not for me!'", "NTA at all. \n\nShe chose to celebrate you and acknowledge your efforts, you didn't make her. You've got a good kid.", "NTA. Your daughter is allowed to celebrate Mother's Day by recognizing whomever she wants.", "NTA that is your daughter's choice and what your sister thinks doesn't matter at all.", "NTA at all!  \n\nTake it from someone who is 52 - I feel the same way about my late dad. I was adopted as a baby. Mom emotionally checked out of our family when I was six. We weren\u2019t close. She passed when I was 16. Dad was always both mom and dad to me. Anyone who says that your daughter can\u2019t feel as she does is incorrect. Please don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH!", "NTA\nYour sister was super rude. Your daughter can celebrate what she wants", "NTA. Parenting is a grueling race. We all deserve more days that celebrate us and our general awesomeness, regardless of sex", "NTA. Your daughter went out of her way to celebrate the people in her life who give her the love a mother would and her Aunt's response was basically to remind her she really doesn't have a mother (that was my first thought when I read it)?\n\nMother's Day is to celebrate the mothers, or those who act as mothers, in our lives. You are doing double duty and thank you for doing it. Your daughter recognizes what you are doing and that is so special. Your daughter has non-traditional mother-figures in her life and that includes you. Your sister's comment was incredibly mean-spirited to both you and your daughter. I'm sure she is a lovely person, but it was a short-sighted comment.", "Absolutely NTA and you\u2019re an awesome parent for providing both roles.

You\u2019re awesome and it obviously means a lot to her.", "NTA. She made a decision and if she wants to celebrate her only parent on mother's day, where's the harm? Some ppl are just caught up in old ways of thinking.", "NTA this isn't a good look for your sister. It comes across as her being jealous that you were mentioned, or feeling like she isn't \"enough\" of a \"motherly influence\" since your daughter mentioned you too. In the grand scheme of things, she's a hypocrite, and lucky she got a mention herself since she's not technically your daughter's mother either.", "Nta. You're a single parent. You have to be both. You can have two days", "NTA - sounds like your sister may have some issues she has to work through.", "NTA.\n\nYour daughter wanted to celebrate you.  You fill both roles for her.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with her including you on Mother's Day.  I think your sister is jealous and she is the A H.\n\nSounds as if you and your daughter have a great relationship and you're doing a great job.  Keep it up dad-mom!", "NTA you didn't ask her to make the post or add you she did it because obviously you are a good dad", "NTA, your sister is the AH\n\nShe'd find life easier if she just minded her own business instead of trying to manage someone else's choices.\n\nMaybe she should apply herself in life and have her own problems like everyone else.", "Your daughter chose to express her love and appreciation for you. You didn\u2019t demand it or even ask. Your sister is a giant AH for diminishing the feelings of a young girl being kind on a day that full of emotional land mines. I hope you tell her that.

I'm not sure what your sister's problem is, because it seems that you are doing an amazing job of being both mom and dad. Such an amazing job that your 15 year old daughter gives you a shout out on social media, a positive shout out. You have to give us your exact formula for parenting.", "NTA mother's day is about *kids celebrating their mother*.. a role you filled for your daughter. Would your sister say the same about a single mom getting a shout out on Father's day? Probably not and it happens all the time. Ignore your sister's negative attitude about it and keep doing what you do.", "NTA.... I see mothers getting shout outs on Father's Day and no one bats an eye... You deserve all the love your daughter has for you! Why is sis so pissy? Curious who she thinks your daughter should be celebrating....?", "Since she celebrated you and you didn't ask her to do so you aren't the asshole.", "NTA - Grandmothers and Aunts aren't celebrated on Mother's Day, either. No complaints about that?\n\nEspecially since it wasn't your post in the first place - it was your daughter's, and if your sister had a problem with it, she would have to direct that at your daughter - and good luck looking like a good person when you're criticizing a motherless teenager about who she should celebrate on Mother's Day.\n\nImo, this is the sort of thing we should let the (older) children lead on. If they want to celebrate their single parent on the opposite holiday as well, let them. If they want to celebrate a stepparent as well, let them.", "NTA, your sister needs to worry about herself", "NTA you should be celebrated both days because you are playing both roles \u2764\ufe0f", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You, Sister, chose to ruin the day by making an ugly comment (did you actually use the word \"asshole\" at a family dinner? Shame on you!) and making your brother feel bad.

Nothing wrong with it at all.
