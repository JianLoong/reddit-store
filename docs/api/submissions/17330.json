She said you're both, mom and dad, so she wants to thank you for being such a great mom to her on mothers day. I thing that's only a sign of how great you're doing with her.\n\nDon't know if you're sister is jealous or has some \"feminism\" reasons for this, but what you did was absolutely right. If you would have told your daughter to not celebrate you for mother's day, you would have told her that sticking to to \"classical roles\" and other peoples expectations is more important than her feelings and what she wants to do. That would have been an AH move and absolutely anti-feministic.", "Your sister is the AH", "NTA. I cried reading this, I can just tell how good of a dad you are and how committed you are to providing for your daughter.", "NTA my aunt is a single mum with two kids and they celebrate both mothers dad and fathers dad with her, most schools in fact here in the UK (or at least the part I live) call it parents days as there are families that are either single parents, same sex parents or have been raised by their grandparents. To your daughter you are both her father and her mother so if she wants to celebrate mothers dad praising you then she\u2019s more than welcome to do so.", "Damn, I teared up. My girls' dad took off on them, it's tough sometimes. In a million years, he could never be the man you are. Your daughter is a lucky girl, and you are a lucky dad. NTA. \n\nYou should tell your daughter in private that what your sister said was rude and she doesn't understand your special bond but that it's okay because auntie doesn't have a dad-mom. Regardless of how strong your relationship is, that would be hurtful and confusing to hear her aunt making a big deal out of nothing when it was all about love and appreciation. I know I would be thinking about it. \n\nI'd also call your sister privately and have a few words so she understands that if she ever talks that way to your daughter again, you'll have to protect her by not allowing them in the same room until auntie can be civil. Nip that in the bud. What a callous thing to do to a little girl who just wants to celebrate the people that stayed in her life.", "NTA who does your sister think she is?? I can\u2019t imagine ever challenging a child who has no mother", "NTA.   Your daughter and you have a wonderful and healthy and obviously loving relationship that isn't about gender roles but rather parenting WELL. Really well. Your daughter celebrated the women in her life and honored you too... so what?  That was a great thing because are stepping up and doing those things for her.    \n\n\nTell your sister to mind her own business.", "NTA and congratulations to you for being a great dad mom!", "You are neither claiming you are her mother nor demanding your daughter to celebrate you on Mother's day. It is a sweet way your daughter uses to appreciate how awesome a parent you are, and how you filled took up all caring for your child on your own and did an excellent job. I don't think it undervalues other single parents that get celebrated only one day, I think it is your daughter expressing herself, and your sister is unreasonable. NTA", "What??? That's an unfair accusation by your sister. I think she has over esteemed her role in your daughter's life. She cannot expect you to underplay what you've done in your daughter's life and she can't expect your daughter to not call out on what you've been to her.\n\nIn my opinion you deserve a shout out both for mother's day and for father's day. You deserve everything your daughter calls you and more.\n\nAnd more importantly, own it. Don't you ever think that you're not worth it!!!\n\nObviously NTA.", "NTA.\nYou rock and so does your daughter for appreciating you and everything you do for her. But gee, showing it twice in a one year? We wouldn't want to spoil you now would we? Lol", "NTA your sister is just jealous you\u2019ll be celebrating twice.", "Absolutely NTA, your daughter is being very sweet. What did your sister want you to do? Reject your daughter's thanks? Forbid her from doing something nice for you?\n\nI mean, I probably would have saved it for Father's Day if I was her, but come on. She wasn't hurting or disparaging anyone. She literally just said nice things about all the people who took over for her mom.\n\nYour sister is awfully upset about something that really shouldn't affect her at all.", "NTA\n\nMy dad raised 2 girls and he gets both Mother's AND Father's Day. He is my hero. I'm 53 now and still very much a Daddy's girl.", "NTA. Shout out to all the single moms who claim Father's Day but get mad when some single dads get celebrated on Mother's Day. Oh the humanity. The HORROR. Idk how your sister survived this atrocity.\n\nAlso, why isn't your sister upset that your daughter mention her in the Mother's Day post, I mean it's not Aunt's Day either so she really is a huge hypocrite.", "You aren\u2019t the AH. your sister is and her comment is misandristic. Imagine if a kid shouted out a single mom on Father\u2019s Day because she played both roles and someone said something about that. Smh. Keep being there for your daughter. Happy Mother\u2019s Day to you!!", "NTA everyone has already made great points but I just wanted to say thank you for not being so stuck in gender roles. You're setting an amazing example for your daughter and I hope she ends up with an equally amazing partner when it's time.", "NTA. While I get the sister saying, it\u2019s Mother\u2019s Day for \u201cmothers\u201d, complaining about non-female identifying people being celebrated is invalidating to all nonconventional parents that fulfil that role.", "NTA and all not \u201callowing\u201d her to celebrate you on Mother\u2019s Day because its for \u201cmoms\u201d would do is cruelly point out that she doesn\u2019t have one. Let her be proud of you however she chooses to.", "NTA, in the U.K. it is not actually Mother\u2019s Day but it is Mothering Sunday , a day when anyone who \u201c mothers\u201d ie provides care and support is celebrated and thanked so being as you are the one providing care and support it is entirely correct that you should be thanked on Mothering Sunday . \nTraditionally it had nothing to do with mothers at all but was actually to celebrate and remember the mother church where a person was baptised and they would return to it and give thanks .", "NTA and bless your daughter\n\n\nI'm a single mother, and my daughter asks every year what I want for Father's Day.\n\nMy post every year is Happy Mothers  Day to all the moms who deserve the title, to all the stepmother Foster mom's and to all the single dads pulling double duty.  (Father's Day I reverse the mom/dad bit)\n\nYour sister is an AH", "NTA, same position as your daughter except dad is the deadbeat. I celebrate my mom on fathers day as well. It's really sweet of your daughter and it shows you raised her well. Kinda off putting how your sister finds you an AH for that eh.", "Nta. Thank you for going above and beyond to raise your daughter. Single fathers are amazing too. Happy mother's day.", "NTA you raised a great daughter! \n\nI myself grew up with a single dad. He was my dad/mom (love the wording) for almost everything. I could ask him anything. He was there for every important and unimportant milestone in my life. Supporting me, being my shoulder to cry on or just happy for me. Even when I started my period my dad never batted an eye to go get my pads at the store. He carried them without shame because he knew I needed them and it was natural for his daughter to go threw this. If he couldn\u2019t help me he asked my grandmother or my aunts (his sisters) for help or advise. To this day he is still my hero!! \n\nAnd you are your daughters hero! She wanted to thank you in her way and she has every right to do it.", "Nta\n\nThere are single moms that have to be dads to their kids too. Similar things happen. Your sister needs to chill. She was mean and out of line.", "NTA\n\nI'm trying very hard to see your sister's point before I judge her as the AH but I just do not see what on earth she was thinking. Your daughter does not have one woman in the mother role who you could potentially be hurting by usurping her day. You *are* caring for her every way her mother should, even more than your mother and sister, grateful as you both are to them for their real and valued support.\n\nNot to mention, this was your daughter's idea and her choice who and how she wants to celebrate. It's not your sister's choice, nor yours.\n\nGiven that your sister has been a help before, I hope she gets past this because it will only drive a wedge between her and your family.", "NTA. I always shout out dads who take up the role as a mom on Mother\u2019s days and vice versa for mom\u2019s on Father\u2019s Day. Parenting is hard even with a partner, but I absolutely applaud everyone who manages to do it on their own. You are doing both roles, you get to celebrate both. Don\u2019t listen to your sister, your daughter loves and appreciates you so much that she wants to celebrate you on Mother\u2019s Day as well as Father\u2019s Day, let her. \n\nBottom line: Her opinion about you is the only one that matters. Sister can butt out of your relationship with your daughter. She doesn\u2019t get to dictate how your daughter celebrates the holidays with you and don\u2019t allow her make you feel guilty for rightfully being acknowledged for your motherly role on Mother\u2019s Day.", "NTA, but your sister is. You are both parents in your daughter's life and as such deserve to be celebrated on both days.\n\nActually, what does your sister expect? For your daughter to completely ignore the holiday? Or dor your daughter to celebrate HER?", "NTA- Your sis is an AH. She had no business of saying what she said.", "NTA. You sound like a great Dad.", "I assure you people bat an eye. Lots of people bat an eye. I see it every year cause I do the same for my mom, and I don't care if people do it for dads too. I'm all for it. But people definitely do not shut up about it lmao", "NTA- your sister needs to get over herself", "It isn't funny though but I agree", ">I feel the same way with people demanding to be celebrated as parents for having pets.\n\nWho exactly is it hurting? How does it affect the \"specialness\"?", "You\u2019ve clearly done an incredible job raising your daughter & being a family!! \n\nI would be having words with your sister about how inappropriate it is to not only police her social media post but also to bring up such a sensitive topic in a negative way!", "That's just not on. I hope your daughter wasn't upset by this? Your sister is taking such a lovely gesture and sentiment and somehow trying to twist it into something it isn't. She should be happy that her niece feels that way about you, but for some reason wants to try and make her feel bad about appreciating you so much. I would be so angry if my sister talked to my child like that.", "Yeah, I think that's great you raised such a sweet and thoughtful girl!!! Way to go, Dad Mom!!! She was just trying to share the love!!!\n\nNTA!", "Your daughter should have celebrated her mother, not you. It doesnt matter if she abandoned you two, she is a woman and better than you, dumb man.\n\nJK, NTA.", "NTA it's weird she took offence?? I get my Dad mother's Day gifts every year because he put the work in and it has nothing to do with anyone else!\nThank you for getting a great Dad-Mom!", "NTA... Monoparental homes with single moms do this every single year and nobody bats an eye. And this was something the girl wanted to do. Your relatives need to understand that this was about the feelings the girl not having her mother around and why she doesn't have her around. It was the child recognizing your efforts.", "NTA.\n\nBut I don't understand why Americans are **so** obsessed with Mother's or Father's Day to the point of risking family ruptures. This is so ridiculous.", "Nope. Didn't have a dad. Celebrated Father's Day for my mom.", "NTA I've been celebrating my mum on father's day for forever with the same logic your daughter expressed. The fact that she appreciates you so much she wants to celebrate you twice a year is bonza and shows that you're a good dad. Ignore the haters. Usually, it's because they feel something is lacking in their lives and isn't actually about you \ud83d\ude0a", "NTA, hope you feel proud. You sound like an amazing dad with an equally amazing kid.", "Sis needs to stay in her lane. NTA.", "Your sister is being sexist \n\nNta", "NTA\nYou sound like a great dad-mom, end of the day your daughter can celebrate the day however she feels, its not brother/sister day so your sister has zero reason to call you out on anything.  I find from personal experience that people that comment on how others spend mothers/father day have some sort of issue with their own way of living/parenting and don\u2019t like being reminded others are better/succeeding at it more.", "NTA\n\nMy mom died when me and my brother were 3 and 8 respectively. My dad didn't remarry and chose to raise both of us as a single dad. As far as I remember, every major moment in my life is with my dad. He was a surrogate mother in addition to being a dad. Hence I don't feel lost on Mother's Day because I have my dad. Your sister is a major AH. Glad your mother sees sense. And it's rich of your sister to criticize her niece regarding a woman who abandoned her daughter and husband because she wasn't ready to be a mother. Enjoy your bond with your daughter. She seems to have her head properly on her shoulders and loves you very much.", ">And then she did a special shout-out to me for being her dad-mom and doing everything for her in both \u201cdad\u201d and \u201cmom\u201d roles.  \n>  \n>My daughter said well dad\u2019s a single parent so he acts as both a dad and a mom\n\nOP, you're NTA, you're a bloody hero, and your daughter clearly recognises this.

You deserve to celebrate both mother's Day and father's Day and pfff to your sister.", "Tell your daughter that her post was great and she did a fantastic job of celebrating and thanking all those that have taken on a maternal role in her life and that you appreciated it.\n\nPrivately tell your sister that criticizing the post in front of the daughter was the most awful cringe thing in the world.", "Your sister is TA. Your daughter is lovely, and I hope you enjoy Father\u2019s Day when it comes around too!", "right on!", "NTA, was raised by my dad and female family members- I said it to all of them bc my dad was the one always there.

Your sister should stay out of it. It's none of her business. Sounds like she's just salty because the entire post wasn't all about glorifying her influence in your daughter's life.

I was raised by Dad, and as a child of a single Father, Mother's Day hurt. It was a reminder every year that I didn't have a Mum who wanted to stick around. But my Dad did his best and acted as both Mum and Dad, so why shouldn't I celebrate him? We made him cards, bought things for him at the Mother's Day stall at school (fluffy pink crocheted clothes hanger one year, haha), and did AAALLL the arts and crafts.
