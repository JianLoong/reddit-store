It's great that you have a strong relationship with your daughter.", "Why is your sister so upset with your daughter celebrating you?\n\nNTA", "NTA.", "NTA.  \nHappy Belated Mothers Day my dude.  \nTell your sister that, technically, you get both mom's & dad's day since you fill both roles.\nMy SO was also a single dad, his daughters took him out to dinner last night to celebrate him.  They'll do it again for Father's Day.", "My friend, you are NOT the AH. You have clearly raised a wonderful daughter. You have nothing to feel bad about. My former daughter in law always gave her mother a Father's Day card and treated her to dinner because her mother was both mom and dad to her. Good job, Dad/Mom!", "NTA.  You\u2019re an awesome Dad doing double duty.", "NTA", "NTA your sister needs to get over herself.  Your daughter can celebrate however she wants.", "NTA. Your daughter is a treasure, and you sound like an amazing dad. I wish half the parents I know were even a fraction as dedicated to their kids. \u2764\ufe0f", "100% NTA. You have nothing to feel bad about. At all.\n\nYour daughter decided to show her love and celebrate you. She can celebrate you every single day in the year and your sister should not be calling you an AH for it.\n\nIf you are an AH for allowing your daughter to celebrate this when you are not the mother, does that mean your daughter should not be allowed to celebrate her grandmother and aunt because they are not her mother either?\n\nMaybe your sister should be proud of how much work you are putting in for your daughter, that she is such an awesome young lady, who likes to show people her appreciation. Isn't that more important than telling people \"you are an AH for letting this happen\", when it is such a nice thing that we should be focusing on?\n\nAlso, you are doing the work of both the father and the mother. So, if she does not celebrate your efforts all these years, does your sister want her to just feel left out when everyone else are celebrating their mothers?\n\nI'm confused. Is your sister jealous? Having a bad day? I don't get why your daughter is doing such a good thing and she has to call you an AH for it.\n\nP.S. keep up the good work! You are doing fantastic with/for your daughter.", "NTA\n\nYour sister sounds jealous. She could get that kind of treatment from her kids too on Fathers Day if she suddenly became a single parent when her kids were only a month old.\n\nGreat job for being there for your daughter and doing all the traditional mom roles, too. I love it when I see dads helping out with dance competitions.", "NTA. Your sister was being the TA for getting so worked up over labels. You are both a mom and a dad, you deserve both days.", "NTA \n\nMy Dad is a dropkick, and I call my Mum every Father's Day to thank her.", "InshaAllah NTA. Your daughter unfortunately doesn\u2019t have a mother figure. You\u2019re an only father, if your daughter wants to celebrate you and express her gratitude for you then she\u2019s always welcome to, anyone that takes issue with it can simply look away.", "NTA keep doing good dad!", "NTA. You are her mom if your daughter feels like it. The fact that your sister called you an asshole, just shows how immature she is.", "Definitely NTA, what ****ing business is it of your sister? You\u2019re a single parent and your daughter is proud to have you as a dad-mom. \n\nHappy Dad-Mothers Day mate! \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA whenever I post about Mothers Day I always make a shout out to the single dads doing the job of both parents. You are amazing and you love your daughter, ignore your sister  she\u2019s an AH.", "NTA\n\nYOU\u2019RE raising your daughter alone. You are dad-mom. On my post yesterday I literally posted, \u201c\u2026and to all the dads that have to be both mom and dad. \u201c", "Nta, in this case this day is equally about you.  You are an exceptional parent and you do everything for your daughter.  Don't let your petty sister ruin a day you and your daughter celebrate. Would she rather your daughter be miserable and feel unhappy on this day because she doesn't have a mom to celebrate with?", "NTA \n\nI only had a mom, and I celebrated her on both Father's and Mother's day.", "NTA. As a single mother, I celebrate Father\u2019s Day. You and I are the same, in that we do both jobs, so we get both days.", "NTA, your daughter should be allowed to celebrate you anyway she wants to regardless of the day or holiday. Keep being the amazing parent she knows you are!", "NTA but your sister is. Your daughter decides who she honors on Mother\u2019s Day. You rock!", "NTA, op. Your sister is though.", "NTA, in fact you are the hero of this story, if anyone dares to say otherwise, just ignore them", "As the daughter of a single father(4 kids), we celebrated him on both holidays.... You're doing a great job and she obviously is a great kid\n\nNTA", "You\u2019ve raised a great kid! NTA", "NTA this is super common. Your sister on the otherhand...AH!", "NTA. I did that also for my mom on father's day", "NTA. Your daughter is 15 and old enough to think of this on her own. You had nothing to do with it (other than being an awesome dad-mom). Your sister is being an ass and should mind her own business.", "NTA- why can\u2019t people just shut up and keep their opinions to themselves. What a jackass.", "NTA!  we were raised by my Mom. We celebrated Mother's Day and Father's Day with her. Her favorite gift was a set of towels that said '#1 Dad is Mom\"\n\nYou are both parents and should be celebrated as such. It's a hard enough job to begin with, don't let people bug you about it.", "Nta. Your daughter chose to do that and that\u2019s absolutely her right to do so. Your sister should criticize your child for expressing the way she feels. It\u2019s weird.", "Your sister is a sexist", "NTA: First off you are both her mom and her dad. You're filling both roles and if she (almost a legal adult) wants to acknowledge that it's totally on her. Second, Mother's Day, in my opinion, is for everyone to celebrate the \"mothers\" in their lives whether it's biological or not, female or not. We all have someone that either showed us what it means to be a mom or what it doesn't and we should be celebrating those things.", "NTA brother your a fucking legend you and your daughter are lucky to have eachother and I\u2019m so happy to see you get the props you deserve from the person you want to hear it from the most.", "NTA. Oh her Aunt is super yucky! Your daughter needs to \u201cfeel\u201d that she has a mother figure in her life to feel equal to other girls on Mothers Day and everyday. You are both. Don\u2019t deny her that right. I have a daughter so I know what. I\u2019m talking about. Your sister has no standing to tell you and your daughter about how to celebrate your life together. So mean!!", "NTA.\n\nI was coming to write the same thing.\n\nOP you are both, you love her you dont ask her to make the post, this was all in her, and how she (fell/feel?), so what you sister say dosent care.", "This!!", ">It\u2019s funny that when women post themselves on Father\u2019s Day bc they\u2019re \u201cmom and dad\u201d no one bats an eye.\n\noh for sure, NTA. Though this is irrelevant to OP's case since it's the daughter who initiated it, the other gender claiming another parent day to be \"celebrated\" still screams narcissistic and attention seeking to me; And kinda takes away the specialness of the day. I feel the same way with people demanding to be celebrated as parents for having pets.", "Shoutout to single Mum-Dads. \ud83d\udc9c", "I bet that makes her feel really special and loved.  And she deserves to feel that way for all the hard work she does!  I think it\u2019s awesome for kids to celebrate their single parents like this.", "Yup. I take my mom out to dinner for Father\u2019s Day every year. Have been doing it since middle school. Never heard a negative word about it.", "I mean statistically, fathers have their roles filled in by other people more than moms do so I get it tbh.", "This. Your sister is completely missing the point. Your daughter never got to have \"an actual mom\", but she saw her friends' moms and saw that you were the onle playing that role for her in her life. So who else would she celebrate on this day? \n\nNTA, but your sister is.", "So true.  Additionally, while OP\u2019s sister claimed OP \u201cencouraged\u201d his daughter to publicly appreciate him on Mother\u2019s Day, there is no evidence of that.  OP\u2019s daughter, who seems wonderful btw, did that on her own.  OP, your sister jumping to incorrect conclusions doesn\u2019t make you an ah.  NTA.", "Hear, hear. I was 21 before I started really appreciating my mom and all she sacrificed in a loveless marriage (for her, at least). The fact OP\u2019s daughter is 15 and caught on says a lot.", "No lies told."]}
