First of all, plenty of single dads wash their hands of the \u201cgirl stuff\u201d entirely, so **GOOD FOR YOU, SIR.** Second, parental honorifics are automatically bestowed upon adults when their children are born, but the true measure of those honorifics is what your children do with them as they get older. It would be different if you lobbied your daughter for the \u201cDad/Mom\u201d title, or if you had somehow pressured her to honor you on Mother\u2019s Day, but if your daughter organically appreciates your parenting efforts to that degree, then you\u2019ve earned any accolades she sees fit to give you. Your sister is not only being dismissive of your parenting, she\u2019s being dismissive of her niece\u2019s right to express her gratitude as she sees fit.

You are doing double duty and thank you for doing it. Your daughter recognizes what you are doing and that is so special.
