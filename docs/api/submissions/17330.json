I'd be asking her why this was so important to her that she felt the need to rub it in a child's face that they don't actually have a mother to celebrate on this day by pointing out that them trying to appreciate the parent they do have is unacceptable or inappropriate. \n\nYou are a wonderful parent and your daughter is lucky to have you as her dad. Your sister owes her an apology for being so *catastrophically* insensitive to a CHILD. NTA.", "Yeah you\u2019re absolutely NTA, OP. My students were making presents for Mother\u2019s Day and I told one student that she could absolutely make a present for her dad because he had to do everything a mom AND a dad would do.
