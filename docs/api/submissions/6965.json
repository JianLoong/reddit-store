I used to babysit her and some other children I'm related to every summer. There's a very large age gap between me and my other siblings, so I'm closer in age to Eve than any of them and have always felt like she's my little sister more than my niece.\n\nShe and I talk a lot, even though I live a few hours away. Eve and I are very similar. She's extremely quiet, soft-spoken, and shy. When she's home, she spends almost all of her time in her room with the door closed. She was a very well-behaved teenager and has never done anything bad - trust me she would tell me. When she gets in an argument, she just retreats.\n\nMy sister (her mom) - Jill (36F) has been with her boyfriend - Jack (36M) - for over 15 years now.\n\nJack is a jerk. He doesn't get along with anyone in our family because of how he has treated Eve and her sibling over the years.\n\nEve called me yesterday and was quite upset. She has a continuous argument with Jack and Jill about how she doesn't keep her room clean. She doesn't leave dirty plates or food around; there's nothing disgusting, it's just cluttered. Which, I have to be honest, I was the same way at 18 and am only slightly better now as an adult.\n\nBut, Jack had gone into her room while she was at work and destroyed her room. He took the drawers off her dresser and dumped them on the ground. Then he took the door off its hinges. When she came home and found all of this, he said if her room was ever that messy again, he would take her stuff into the yard and burn it. Jill agreed with it and said that Eve had been warned too many times.\n\nI encouraged Eve to go move in with my parents (her grandparents) until she can find an apartment. This is something that has been discussed between my parents, me, and Eve quite a bit. When I moved out, they kept my room the same in case Eve or her sibling wanted to move in.\n\nI called my mom this morning and she immediately agreed to let Eve move in. I took off work and helped Eve move her things. I could tell Eve felt alone and needed someone on her side.\n\nEve cried the entire time and told me that Jack had also been body shaming her lately - saying things like \"not surprised you're eating again\" and making oinking noises at her while she was eating.\n\nJack and Jill showed up at my parents' house, and I told Eve I would handle it. So she went to her room.\n\nI tried to explain things how I saw it - they'd created an unhealthy environment for Eve and stripped her of any privacy, even though she's an 18 year old and they'd encouraged her to continue living at home while she went to college.\n\nJill and Jack started screaming at me. Jill told me it wasn't any of my business, and Jack called me a bitch. I called Jack every bad name I could think of.\n\nMy mom showed up halfway shortly after. She sent Jack and Jill away, telling them to just give Eve some space.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673329993, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/108233q/aita_for_moving_my_niece_out_of_her_house_and/", "score": 232, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
