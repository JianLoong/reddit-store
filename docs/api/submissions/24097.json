On the other hand, I am a cynic who thinks that even now, he will find ways to rationalize why he is still not wrong. Do you really think this is the first conversation OP has had like this?

Options are actually talk to him and know his views or get him to admit he's wrong but he keep the same views.  \n\nWhen you catch a racist in a double standard they'll say well you got me there but they're still racist. They'll admit in that one case they were wrong but their world view is still the same.", "I know that but the easiest way to get him to listen is by making that analogy. He doesn't see it as it an issue that effects me or even us, we're not having more kids, there's no possibility of an accident either. So why do i care? When i explain that Daughter might need these services and the many reasons why, well, that opens the door because now he's listening."]}
