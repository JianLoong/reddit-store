One has been my most reliable car ever, but because I don't have my license just yet it doesn't exactly just sit there as it is my daily but my bf drives. Me and my boyfriend switch between cars depending on how much space we need or how much gas we need as mine is a gas hog. My car is currently experiencing a few serious problems, it is drivable but only under certain conditions and I can't trust anyone to drive it correctly, so as of late we haven't been driving it as to not cause the problem to get any worse. \n\nSo my mom gets a job interview and I agree that she can borrow it for the day, but only for the day.  So she borrows it and the next day comes around, the day she is supposed to give it back. I'm at school and she calls me while I'm at school and asks if she can pay to get it fixed so she can use it for an extended period of time until she can get a car, I tell her I appreciate the offer but I really don't want anyone driving my car or putting miles on it, so I decline the offer and I hang up. \n\nThe next day she texts me saying I need to talk to you, so I said okay she can call, so she calls and goes into how she really needs a car for the new job because she needs to be able to come and go freely. So she goes on to say I'm asking you of this family loyalty favor and that she talked to a few people for advice and there saying there there's an ulterior motive to me not letting her borrow the car and that she is offended I'm not letting her use my car because I have two. \n\nNow for more context, I am the oldest out of 5 im 24,  and for the past few years I have been helping more than anybody else out of the 5 children 3 are adults. So when I had a different car I let her use it for an extended period of time because I didn't care about that car. I pick up my sisters from school and give her rides, I even paid for a car part for her and coolant when she had a car i also didn't have the means to do so. \n\nNow when she called me that day I did get angry and elevated my voice a little bit and was also shaking, which is not how I should have reacted but im working on it,  I also wasnt sure how else to react when I literally had already told her no, but she wouldn't just accept it. \nI pick up the car and now she's texting me saying that she will not be treated like a 24 year old peer and that her stuff is more important and that if my loyalty don't lie with the family and that if i can't support something that will benefit the whole family then I have some serious issues. \n\nI have never once treated her like a 24 year old peer, but just because your my mom doesn't mean your entitled to my things, if my helping out all the times before isnt me showing loyalty then i don't know what is.

I am just hurt that after all the help I do give, I'm treated this way after I do eventually say no.
