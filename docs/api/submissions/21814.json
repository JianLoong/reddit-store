Well today was my sister birthday party and my step mom invited us, everything was going fine when my dad got up to make a toast, since I was already really tired, I was just planning on tuning him out, until he said \u201cthis toast is for my one and only daughter\u201d and he said this while looking at her with the biggest smile, I was gobsmacked, I looked at my mom and she made a jester to leave, I grabbed my stuff and we left immediately, I was crying so hard that my mom started to cry as well, I am heartbroken by this and most of all betrayed by all of this. I do feel bad for leaving because that is my little sister but at the same time, why would he say that so, AITA for walking out of my lil sis birthday party bc of a comment my bio dad made?", "created_utc": 1688950389, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vf8mg/aita_for_walking_out_of_my_lil_sis_birthday_party/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You'll never have to explain why you don't want your father around.", "NTA.\n\nI was completely prepared to call you an AH after the first sentence because making a scene at a little kids birthday by walking out is a big deal.\n\nBut this warranted it COMPLETELY.\n\nYou actually handled this far more maturely than I would at 30+ years old", "NTA. I\u2019d walk out too, that can be seriously heartbreaking and overwhelming and walking out rather than letting your little sister see that was probably the better idea anyways. Sometimes fathers are a girl\u2019s biggest heartbreak, mine included. I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that.", "NTA\nWho makes a toast at an 8yo's birthday party? Oh yeah someone who's an AH to his daughter.", "NTA\n\nBio dad behaved with cruel intention. You were right to leave. Little sis may be only 8, but even an 8 year old could understand how hurtful that was for you.\n\nYou're right to stay away from him. He needs help.", "NTA.  Your Dad acted in a way that would have De Sade taking notes.  Totally understandable to leave and your mum knew fully well it was the best move too.  I feel sorry for your sis, not because you left, but because she's going to find out just how bad he is in time.", "NTA, I do not talk to my dad either. He\u2019s an alcoholic, he has missed a lot in me and my sisters life. I feel bad for your sister as well but I assume she is your half sister? If he is saying she\u2019s his only daughter, then by that logic she isn\u2019t your sister if she\u2019s only related to you through him. I could be wrong and she could be your full sister, but either way, he publicly disowned you. I have a feeling stepmom invited you there to make you watch him do it", "NTA.\n\nI'm so sorry your father is terrible. It must be so hard being suck with that. His comment was so cruel and cold that you leaving is entirely justified. \n\nI'd never judge you for deciding you don't have a father.", "NTA your father showed everyone at that party what a heartless you know what he is.", "NTA.. I'm fairly sure I'd do the same in that circumstance.", "NTA. It sucks that people like your bio dad are parents. I would just have a sit down with your sister and tell her how you care about her and that you wanted to stay but were hurt by the situation. She should be old enough to understand at 8.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I\u2019m sorry that you had to hear that.", "Definitely NTA and I\u2019m sorry your dad did that! It was cruel and unnecessary!! Cut him back out of your life completely. Nothing wrong with removing yourself from a situation that you\u2019re uncomfortable in!!", "NTA. I walked out of my mother's out-of-town birthday party (that I had organized) because of something my father said and did  \n\nIn the end, you owe it to yourself to get yourself out of spaces where you are mistreated. \n\nYou have little control over how people will treat you, but you have full control over how you respond.", "Your father is a mean spirited man. I could cry for you, and your sister too. He used one child\u2019s birthday, to be nasty to his other child. He doesn\u2019t care about either of your feelings. NTA", "So you went no contact with your dad and you are upset that he has accepted that and is following through with what you want? You don\u2019t get it both ways. You don\u2019t get to go no contact, deny he is there and then get mad when he follows your lead.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nWow. I\u2019m not sure I even have words for what your father did here. What an absolute dick move.", "NTA it might feel uncomfortable right now, but You\u2019ll be glad in the future that you refused to stay and be disrespected. You didn\u2019t make a scene or complain, you walked out with dignity.", "NTA", "Yes she is my half sister", "Thats rough, I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that, some parents really don\u2019t care about what they say", "We went no contact because of something he said to my mom and it wasn\u2019t my choice, he was the one who hasn\u2019t texted nor talked to me so yeah", "First, there's a difference between going no-contact with someone and publicly disowning them and no longer claiming them as your child. \n\nSecond, let's not pretend that the father was respecting OP's wishes. This comment was purposefully said to hurt her. She's not hypocritical for being upset at a comment meant to upset her. Going along with the no contact would be politely ignoring OP. The dad's double AH  because he did this at his *other daughter*'s party, as part of a toast *for her*. He made her a pawn in his game and basically made *her toast* really be a shaded backhand insult at someone else.", "That\u2019s not something a decent parent says about their child, even if the child goes no contact. My child will always be my child, and I would never be this petty even if my child behaved badly, which I seriously doubt in this case. The fact that OP is even entertaining your comments, and engaging with you with an open mind, speaks volumes for her character.", "Thank you for clarifying! No you are definitely not the asshole here. I\u2019m very sorry you are going through this. It sounds like you care for your sister quite a bit, if history repeats itself she will need support down the road if/when he decides to disown her as well, she will need support and love from family who really cares for her", "Thanks. Or...they do care and purposely chose to say what they say. \n\nThen you get to enforce...consequences. :-)", "So he went no contact bc of something he said about your mom? That makes zero sense. That\u2019s like me saying I\u2019m going no contact with my mom because I said something about my cousin.", "I understand what you are saying, the thing is, he basically told me a bunch of lies about my mom and when I told her and she confronted him about it, he played dumb, said I was crazy and we haven\u2019t spoken since"]}
