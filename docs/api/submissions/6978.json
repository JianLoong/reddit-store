OP was the asshole. Literally chose the wrong hill to die on and abandoned her husband.", "Yeah, nobody handled that one well but it's right on the border between YTA and ESH. As distraught as the husband was (and I've been there myself), he should've taken a second to think about his mother's actions.", "I dunno if the OP was the only asshole, I can see the OP snapping after a while of terrible treatment.

She basically handed OP a grenade and watched her pull the pin.", "Maybe, maybe not. The ultimate MIL move would have been to invite both, but only pay for the son\u2018s flight and let OP cover the costs. In the end MIL still paid for a plane ticket for OP. Suck it up and be there for your husband and be happy that somebody paid for your trip.", "But also, did no one think that OPs husband could DOWNGRADE his seat so they could sit together? I'm pretty sure airlines would be thrilled to do that, cause they'll keep the money and stick you in the crappy seat. I know their husband was grieving, but like this didn't cross his mind at all??? And it would've been a great slap in the face to MIL cause I bet she would've been livid she paid for a first class ticket that didn't get used.", "How is it a lose lose situation? OP could have just went to the economy section and suck it up, or pay the extra to go to first. It's far, FAR from being the end of the world.\n\nAnd I dunno but, her MIL doesn't have to pay for her FIRST CLASS ticket? It's a generosity to even pay for one in my sense.\n\nHer ego was in the way, and she abandoned her husband in one of the worst moment of his life. She's YTA all the way.", "I feel like the 2 different tickets drove a bigger wedge than just getting one", "And the edit, about part of her reasoning for not settling for economy being that she wanted to support him, just made it worse. She couldn't support him in the way SHE wanted, so she chose to... be even less supportive?", "Another commenter on the post brought up a good point about their experience booking tickets last minute. There may have only been 2 seats on the flight and the MIL bought both. \nIf my SO lost a parent, and I was supporting them, I\u2019d let her enjoy the Champagne and leg room while watching trash programming.\n\nI can\u2019t speak for everyone, but watching 5 episodes of The Big Bang theory would be WAY more distracting than having my hand held and getting sympathetic glances through out the flights.

The MIL possibly an AH.", "Yeah, I voted YTA and it is *by far* the most conversation I've seen on a post.\n\nThe real depressing part is how many people basically replied with \"his grandpa isn't an AH or sexist for explicitly disinheriting women, just smart.\"", "My dad went on business trips a lot and the company paid for business class plane tickets. One time my mom decided to go, but they couldn't afford to justify paying for business class for her too, so she sat in economy.

More than any story on Reddit should have but it's just something I kept turning over in my mind long after I read the original post and initial and most upvoted reactions. To me this is clearly a YTA judgment and all of the NTA and ESH were infuriating. There is no question here (to me) that this is absolutely not a difficult decision.\n\n\n\n\n- [ ] The assumptions vs the unreliable narrator. We don't know anything about OP and MILs relationship outside of OP suggests MIL doesn't like her and is passive aggressive sometimes. So many commenters suggest MIL is the devil with zero context. That even if OP is YTA in this situation, she has only hurt herself because she's played into MILs hand. However, even if we accept that OP is completely forthright, being passive aggressive sometimes isn't the same as being able to be calculating and cruel in one's time of grief. Could MIL be both passive aggressive and cruel? Of course. But couldn't MIL just be passive aggressive and irritating? Or could OP actually be the problem? Could she not be divisive and selfish and creating unnecessary tension with her husband's relationship with his mother? Or maybe and most likely something along the lines of Hanlon's razor (which I'm pretty sure I learned about from this sub) \"Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.\" My point being, the truth is probably somewhere in the middle. If we are to take OP in good faith then we should MIL as well by virtue of the lack of information present over what their relationship is actually like outside of whatever OP considers \"passive aggressive\".\n\n\n- [ ] Something I see on this sub a lot is the comment that goes, \"if the genders were reversed...\" And 9 times out of 10 this makes me roll my eyes because it seems like the poster is really just trying to say, I have zero empathy for women. But here I have to wonder. If the genders were reversed I absolutely do think the comments on this post would've been different. If a woman who's mother had died suddenly was abandoned at an airport by her husband because said husband had perceived a slight from his FIL? The husband would've been ruled TA without hesitation. And for a multitude of reasons.... \n\n\n- [ ] The witch MIL stereotype - we're conditioned to believe that a woman, any woman, is capable of being a manipulative witch that even in her time of grief it's more likely she's trying to actively harm her DIL than just not thinking?\n\n\n- [ ] That a man should be more rational in a state of grief than a woman who has a bad relationship with her MIL. \n\n\n- [ ] So I have to side with the if the genders were reversed.... solely because the top responses to this seemed so sexist and patriarchal. Men deserve the space to grieve and be emotonal. They need it. We all need it. Patriarchy is toxic not just because the boxes it puts women in, but the boxes it puts men in as well. Can you really, really blame a person for being too exhausted to deal with their partner's distaste for their surviving parent when the other has just died? Even it everything OP said was true and MIL was the witch we're supposed to believe she is, why now? Why this moment to make your stand? What stand is there to take when the person you're supposed to love more than anyone in the world is hurting?\n\n\nAll of this is to stay I really wished I'd taken the time to respond to the original post but didn't. I gave this more headspace than I should've and seeing it mentioned here touched a nerve. And I wholeheartedly disagree with this post as a \"most difficult decision\" nomination because the decision is absolutely not difficult in my eyes. \n\n\n- [ ] A person died. And suddenly. From accident or sudden illness or even negligence or murder, we don't know. They will never see another sunrise. Or laugh. Or kiss and cuddle their spouse. Or tell a bad joke to their friends. Whatever else you think of OPs story, if someone you love loses someone important to them, try holding their hand before gunning for the moral high ground.", "Good response. \n\nAll the other stuff doesn\u2019t really matter; at the end of the day, DH lost dad, and she should have supported him through that best she could. She didn\u2019t.", "Nah. By paying for the ticket, OP didn\u2019t have a legitimate reason not to go (no flights/too expensive). MIL play, intentional or not, was brilliantly revealing of all parties.", "Not difficult decision at all. He\u2019s a good father to take care of the child in the best way for him. 3x salary is huge. However a very difficult situation.", "Husband too for not immediately switching to economy to sit with wife", "The thing I don't understand the most about that one is the lack of communication. I can completely understand the OP not asking whether or not they would be seated together, because there's no real reason to suggest one of them would be in first class and the other not. I don't know why the MIL didn't communicate her reasons for the difference in tickets - whether there was only 2 spaces left, whether she couldn't afford it and could give OP the option to upgrade and have MIL cover a portion, whether it was a pretty move on purpose , etc. There's a lot of missing info and the OP never responded to elaborate. \n\nI do think ESH for that one, but the OP sucks the most.", "Not disputing that OP was an asshole, but surely you can see that he is far from the only asshole in that situation?", "I wish I could vote for this one for most persuasive comment because you definitely convinced me here!", "I did agree - but if the MIL was as passive aggressive as the OP says she is, I can also totally envision a scenario where she's like \"How dare you ask me this when I'm grieving?!\"\n\nBut I could totally be wrong.", "It wouldn't be \"most difficult decision\" if it was obvious what the judgment should be, and don't call me Shirley.", "It is."]}
