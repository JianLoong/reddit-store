It sounds like it got to that point. \n\nYou don't mention anything that indicates your mom might be irresponsible or abusive here either, so I don't think that's a factor either. \n\nSounds like she might have some \"white coat\" anxiety about going to the doctor.... Which is fair. Going to the OBGYN isn't a super fun time. But more than likely, she'd see her family doc first. Also she may be reassured to know that the doctor would require her personal consent (in addition to your mom's) to do anything, so she would be able to have some control over what she's comfortable with. \n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA. If her health is in jeopardy you did the right thing.", "NTA, you weighed the health of your sister over her feelings.  Yeah, it sucks, but if she's suffering that much, it's best to let someone with the experience to be able to help know.\n\nShe might be angry with you a bit, but she'll hopefully realize you did it with her best interests in mind.", "**NTA**\n\nHonestly, you should have reassured your sister from the start that keeping this a secret was not going to make her situation better, that there was no reason to believe that her situation was going to be like yours, and that if she DID have any issues, the doctor was there to HELP make them better so she didn't have to suffer . . . but you're 15, and you're certainly not an AH for not thinking of that stuff. You're also a kid.\n\nWhat this really boils down to is that keeping medical or health secrets - or ANY secret about potentially dangerous, harmful, or traumatising things - from your parents when you're a minor is never a good idea. As an adult and an educator about this stuff, we try to teach very young kids early on that \"surprises are find but secrets are not\". That applies to abuse, but also to medical stuff or, as I said, anything harmful or painful or worrisome. It is ALWAYS better to share with the grownups who love you. It's literally THEIR JOB to make sure you're okay and safe.\n\nYou were right not to keep your sister's secret, because she was harming herself by not telling your mum and getting medical help. Not harming herself on purpose maybe, but letting a medical issue go untreated. And while I hesitate to call her an AH for that, I will call her an AH for getting angry at you for seeking help for her. You're a great big sister and you did the right thing.", "NTA, you had her best interests at heart, she\u2019s angry now, but chances are you are helping her get out ahead of something that could be bad.

She needs to see a doctor. You were concerned for her health, and so you told a trusted adult who is responsible for her health. I would have tried first to explain this to her, that she needs help and she can't avoid that. I would have offered to tell your mom together, given her the choice of \"Either we tell her or I tell her, but someone needs to tell her.\"", "OP, don't feel bad.  You kept the secret when things were chill but if she was in that shape, that's bad and she needs help.  Sometimes we need to do what's best for people, even if it means they'll be mad for a bit.\n\nMy uterus literally tried to bleed me to death, and almost succeeded.

If you told her that and she refused, I could understand why you would still feel the need to intervene.

She gets a pass for the same reason Penny does. She\u2019s a kid. \n\nMaybe not completely on topic, but this is exactly the kind of thing my wife and I drilled into our kids heads growing up. Mom and dad are here for you, and we want you to come to us if you don\u2019t know what to do or think someone\u2019s in danger. The fact that OP was willing to do that in this case says a lot about the parenting she\u2019s gotten. I don\u2019t think it would\u2019ve happened if trust was lacking.", "Oh aye I don't dispute that objectively OP did the right thing by raising a flag, it's just a shame (at least in my mind) that she had to break her sister's trust to do it, rather than explaining to her sister WHY it was important to seek help rather than keeping it to herself and to actually go to the proper channels for assistance.\n\nWhen you're in a highly stressful situation (as the sister was) you end up with all these added anxieties and it can be difficult to cope. Dumping someone in the deep end and forcing them to confront what they're most afraid of without bringing them down to a calm place first ends up making things worse. So maybe next time OP's sister finds herself in need of help she may be unwilling to reach out to her sister because she lacks the trust of confidentiality. I sincerely hope that's not the case", "NAH you are a child, and so your sister.
