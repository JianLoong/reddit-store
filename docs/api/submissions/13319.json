It simply states the facts - you are tall in a short family.  My brother, who is 37, gets these comments or he's \"the tall one\" at 6'0 even, with the next tallest male cousin around 5'7 and the tallest female around 5'4 (though the shortest female cousins are around 4'11).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>She looked so upset and uncomfortable so I stepped in and said \u2018at least I\u2019ve not grown into being a fat b\\*\\*ch like you\n\nThat's an extreme reaction, w/ both abusive body-size and gender-specific comments.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My dads side of the family are always so rude to me and my mom and I just feel like I had to do something about it. \n\nNot specified in your post, so hard to say. Stop going to these family functions if you hate your family. YTA based on what is written in the post.", "YTA.  Don't play the \"I'm 20 and mature\" card if you're going to overreact like a butthurt fourth grader over a pretty vanilla comment.", "YTA \n\nSeriously, are you 12? She didn\u2019t even comment anything bad. She can always lose weight but you don\u2019t get rid of ugly on the inside.\n\nY\u2019all are fucking reaching. I\u2019ve wondered where my husband gets his height too. Typically, there a grandparent or great one in the picture that passed down height.", "YTA. That was a massive (and very rude) overreaction on your part to a comment that is harmless. \n\nYou are significantly taller than anyone in your family. It is not weird that your cousin would wonder what genetics are making you 6'5\" when everyone else is under 6ft. Maybe there was a tall grandparent or great-grandparent.\n\nNobody was being rude to you. You were being very rude to your cousin, though.", "YTA. She made a totally normal comment that was not insulting at all. She was just making conversation and you responded with a straight up insult for no reason. Did you ever wonder if all of the people on your dad's side of the family act strange around you because *you* treat *them* poorly?", "With the family history you've shared, it's reasonable for you to be defensive around your  dad's family.\n\n\u2018wow you\u2019ve grown very tall haven\u2019t you? Wonder where he gets it from'\n\nYou over reacted.  YTA", "YTA- someone commenting that on your height like that is not an insult. It's simply making an observation. As you yourself mentioned the rest of your family is on the shorter side... so of course a comment like \"wonder where he gets that from\" is perfectly normal... you jumping to the extreme and swearing at your cousin was completely unnecessary and if you were at a family gathering I was hosting I would have asked you to leave\n\nAlso news flash: people weren't muttering about you because you were tall. They're muttering about you because out of no where you started insulting and swearing at your cousin", "YTA you might be tall but the reach you just pulled to be cruel to your cousin has got nothing to do with height.", "YTA. Geez, you went straight for the jugular! She was simply just making a comment that frankly, many people say to tall people whose parents are not equally as tall. Literally just a comment. Didn\u2019t insult your height at all. You owe her an apology.", "YTA\n\nI thought I would go for E S H but then I had to reread her comment 3 times to make sure I didn't accidentally miss the insult.\n\nDude, she just said you're tall. Being super tall, while remarkable, doesn't come with negative associations per se (unlike with the word fat). That was a huge overreaction. You said you've never been too insecure but that is obviously not true. If an off-hand comment like that sets you off like this, you have self-image issues for sure and your poor cousin doesn't deserves to be attacked like that.", "Sorry but your wrong. I think in usual situations yea you would be right. But with context OP provided that the dads side tends to treat him and his mom poorly, his dads parents have tried to get him to divorce his mother, it\u2019s clear that this is a common theme and more of a breaking point for OP where he stood up for himself", "I bet those comments get old fast. You need to think of a better comeback than that though. YTA.", "YTA, Jesus Christ", "YTA most likely.\n\nFirst off, you include a lot of extraneous details about familial relationships that have no actual bearing on the matter at hand.\n\nYour cousin's comment could only be considered insulting if it was with a tone and intention of perhaps implying that your mom boned some tall dude and your dad isn't your real dad. But I am assuming that isn't the case as you didn't mention that scenario and you seem to think it was insulting just because it pointed out that you are tall. Like, why is that an insult? You are tall. And the \"where he gets it from\" is more like, \"what relatives in the past were tall given his parents are short?\". Its a pretty benign comment from my perspective.", "NTA \n\nThe implication is that your mother cheated. And the comment of your dad being \"willfully blind\"? Also an implication against your mom", "YTA. Nothing even remotely insulting was said to you.", ">as usual people were clearly muttering about me.\n\nUhh, if you go around saying shit like this, that is hardly shocking.", "YTA.  A comment, or more of an acknowledgement took place & you lost it for no reason.  There's no good reason to call someone what you did.  Be the better person & ignore it or just say leave me alone.  Calling someone names is never the answer.", "YTA. Your cousin\u2019s comments were innocent. If someone is making comments (about your body, or mother\u2019s finances, or anything else) the correct response is to say\n\n\u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about my body. I\u2019m going to say hi to Uncle Harold/pet the dog/make a phone call/etc\u201d.", "YTA. That you had to ask confirms it.", "YTA. That was not a clearly insulting comment. You were looking to be offended and way over reacted due to previous perceptions of your paternal side of the family. Grow up.", "Yta", "YTA.\n\nWay to jump to nuclear levels instantly. What they said was annoying but in NO WAY required your incredibly hostile response.", "YTA\n\nNothing rude or demeaning about what your cousin said. Your just soft as shit.", "YTA.  That comment wasn\u2019t insulting in any way, shape or form.  Jesus.  I can guarantee you that it isn\u2019t your dad\u2019s side of the family that are the rude ones, it\u2019s you.", "Wait they are implying that your mom cheated on your dad and that you're not his bio son", "YTA\n\nDude I totally get it.

Point is, it sucks to feel ostracized or like you stick out because of appearances, and people often lack tact when addressing it. \n\nAll that being said, you can\u2019t respond to a neutral comment with such vile words and expect it to be even. They made a tone deaf comment, you purposefully hurt them. It\u2019s not the same.", "You are way over thinking things. Be mentally stronger.", "YTA that was 0 to 100 and you know it.", "ESH and I don\u2019t usually say this. You do realize, I am sure, they are implying you aren\u2019t your dad\u2019s child? You shouldn\u2019t have criticized someone\u2019s weight. Not ok, but it has to get old. You can\u2019t control how tall you are.", "NTA. She\u2019s not dissing your height. She\u2019s calling your mom a whore", "ESH. As a person who gets teased a lot for being extremely short, I know the feeling of not fitting in. The rest of my family are pretty tall, and I'm here at 4'10.\n\nYou should not have called her what you did. But the way you said it, she meant it as an insult.\n\nHowever, I'm missing some info. What was her tone when she said it? Wondering? A bit envious? Teasingly?", "ESH.\n\nI could be overthinking things, but I don't believe your cousin's insult was implying that you are freakishly tall, but rather that your cousin was implying that your mom cheated and that your tallness is coming from outside the family somewhere. There is also a lot of implications in your post that the dad's side of the family seems to be leaning towards the infidelity side of things too.\n\nYour response was rude too, but not necessarily unwarranted. I just think it was responding to the wrong aspect of her insult.\n\nEDIT: If I am misjudging her intentions of her comment and it really was just something like \"hey, we don't have any tall people in the family, how did you grow so much compared to everyone else.\" then you are definitely an asshole. You are very tall. You are going to get comments about your height for the rest of your life. I'm not saying that you can't get annoyed with them, but you should probably have a better response lined up for it.", "YTA. That huge insult because she said you were tall? Really?", "YTA. You are 20 not 12. Grow the fuck up. Being tall you will always get comments like that or jokes like how is the weather up there. Your comment was completely uncalled for and escalated things to another level. You need to have thicker skin.", "YTA. I also have to ask here if gender could be relevant. Because culturally (at least where I\u2019m from) pointing out how tall a woman is *could* be insulting, depending on the phrasing. But height in men is considered only a positive thing.  If you don\u2019t fit within either of those categories disregard. But despite that, you\u2019re still TA based on the post. Nothing about that comment seems insulting, and asking where your height comes from is absolutely an innocent and common saying (again, in my country) that is not implying anything about infidelity. This was just a major projection of your own insecurities. Way overreaction.", "ESH - There seems to be the sense that you may not be your dad's bio kid. Is that the case?", "YTA.  She made a comment about your height - not condescending, and not with any name calling.  You got personal and mean.", "YTA by far. You overreacted and was a asshole.", "YTA, was told he was tall, decides to just go nuclear for 0 reason.", "INFO have you ever said that it makes you uncomfortable? It's written as if you've never said anything before then lashed out. I know tall people have to deal with \"tall\" comments a lot and it's annoying. Probably more so when it's family who you see all the time.\n\n>My cousin said to me and my mom, \u2018wow you\u2019ve grown very tall haven\u2019t you? Wonder where he gets it from\u2019\n\nDo you see your cousin a lot? Comment is phrased as if she hasn't seen you.\n\nFor the rest it sounds as though it's possible that your dad's side of the family is rude to your mom.", "YTA\n\nWow. You went from 0 to 100 so quick! I don't see what your cousin said as rude. She made a very normal comment, and you just assumed she was somehow accusing your mom of being unfaithful to your dad.", "YTA. I'm top heavy; my mom and her sisters have bee stings. Folks are always asking where I got them from...it's not an insult. Nobody is suggesting anything untoward. It's just because I'm different than the typical gene expression. You went from 0-100 over nothing. Apologize and consider working on your insecurities.", "ESH... get a paternity test so 1, you will know for yourself and more importantly you can flip it out in front of them next time they imply something. \n\nI hate to say this, but it could very well be that the family treats you that way because they probably think your mom cheated or something. \n\nI'm not saying I think that or that I don't know how genetics work, but it does seem quite possible that maybe think think (or know?) that you don't belong. \n\nYou could say something to your mom casually, \"I'm thinking of doing a 23 and me to find out where we come from\"... if this gets resistance from your mom, she doesn't want you to know something.", "ESH but also leaning towards Y T A\nI get that it's annoying getting these comments all the time. And your family kind of implying your mother might have cheated is ridiculous and unnecessary.\nBut tbh, I think your cousin, while not being very nice or at least socially awkward, didn't imply anything or wanted to be mean.\nYou on the other hand were intentionally offensive and you know that.", "YTA I don't see how that comment made by your cousin was meant to be insulting. However YOUR comment to your cousin certainly was meant to be insulting. Maybe she didn't mean to hurt your feelings but YOU certainly did.", "YTA. What she said was neutral. YOU *heard* what you wanted to hear because of your own personal perspective/expectations. It's pretty common when someone sees a parent and child who are so different in height to remark on it; and while it might be mildly rude - it's nowhere near as bad as calling someone a 'fat b\\*\\*\\*h' at a family function! My bestie has 4 kids that are way taller than her, and when we haven't seen the kids in awhile, it's a shock (in memory they are always still just wee little guys), so yes, we remark - holy crap you got tall, and what have you been feeding this kid? It's not like we actually believe anything questionable is going on, it's just a dumb comment! Sure, I'm certain they hear that a lot and might be tired of it. Just as the guys named Sam Adams or Dave Thomas or James Bond gets sick of the comments.  You were fully inappropriate, your cousin was not.", "YTA\n\nWhat was said wasn't even an insult just a regular observation. Most people in my family are really tall, my little sibling has towered over me since we were kids. Most people have wondered where my height comes from because it's out of the norm for my family. They aren't implying that my mother cheated, just that genetics are weird.", "ESH\n\nThey\u2018re also implying your Mom cheated and your Dad isnt your biological Dad.", "NTA.  We all know what the implication is behind \"wonder where he gets it from\".  That's why your mom was upset and uncomfortable, in addition to all the history. \nYou are justified in standing up for yourself and your mother, and making it clear you will not take shit from anyone.  Keep it that way.", "I don't think she was trying to insult you, but depending on her tone, you yourself are the best judge", "NTA. \n\nImplying you aren't your father's son was a trash move.", "ESH because you dropped down to her level, but imo, in your case, its very much justified.", "NTA. You\u2019ve been tall forever, as many others have said it\u2019s an implied you\u2019re not dads son. After so many years of hearing this it was bound to happen so now they know the FAFO nature of this. Perhaps Dad needs to step and in say leave my son and my wife alone. \n\nKudos to you too for standing up for mom when it doesn\u2019t seem Dad does.", "ESH. Them because they\u2019re snidely implying you\u2019re not your dad\u2019s kid. You because there are MUCH better ways you could have responded than going for the cheap shot. Just stop interacting with them. Don\u2019t go", "NTA. None of the people calling you an asshole get these same stupid sayings said to them all the time. I'm tall and have red hair so I get \"how's the weather up there\" and \"so that's what a red beard looks like\" all the time and it's annoying as hell so fuck em.", "NTA you were trying to set healthy boundaries and protect your mom. Mom has to deal with it her own way. You did go on the attack, and it didn't make you look good...but forgive yourself, that was tough. Especially given the history. There's good advice here for shrugging such comments off: \"Yep, I sure am tall. How have you been?\" or just make an excuse to move on without explaining. It's hard to stand out, especially with people you don't like or trust. If they want a reaction, just stay cordial and make sure they don't get one. Or just stop going to see them, they sound awful.", "ESH. As a person who has been tall my whole life, yeah it gets FUCKING ANNOYING. But you\u2019re old enough to grin and bear it for the time being. It was a relatively tame comment. But it sounds like this could easily escalate on their parts.", "ESH, but you need to get better at insulting people. Instead of calling her a fat bitch, you could have said, \"We know which aisle of the grocery store you got your size from though\". If you're gonna be an asshole, make it so good they'll wake up from a deep slumber in 10 years and still feel bad about it.", "I'm going with NTA, and here's why: It seems to me that this side of the family has been mistreating OP and their mom for quite a while. Maybe this wasn't the best response, but it is understandable after what appears to be years of insults against them both. I don't condone fat-shaming etc, but it is an understandable thing to finally snap at someone like that.", "ESH. Normally I would call you the AH because that was a rude reaction. I am also much taller than most family members (though not nearly as tall as you) and there is often a discussion of which ancestor was tall like me.

Something like \u201cit\u2019s just because my parents fed me right\u201d\n\nCalling someone a \u201cfat bitch\u201d during small talk will never not be horribly awkward and weird, and it\u2019s sad this needs to be said lmao. Maybe that\u2019s why they treat him differently?", "He said he\u2019s insecure about it. No one gets to tell you about what makes you insecure. He felt belittled and he responded. I know some people that don\u2019t mind being called fat. Soooo. Keep your comments to yourself about people. You might be okay with being called tall but OP clearly was not. NTA OP", "I mean, I can see why OP would see the comment as rude. We don't know how it was said. In the context of the post with that side of the family always treating OP and mother differently, the \"willfully blind\" comment to the dad, etc. The context to me is saying that they are implying something rude with the comment. Do I think the reaction was over the top? Yes. Do I understand why? Also yes. I'm fine being downvoted, since everyone else seems to think that OP is a malicious AH.", "All he said around why he was insulted was \n\n> that was so insulting because she just implied that I\u2019m freakishly talk\n\nIt\u2019s hard to believe that OP wouldn\u2019t have mentioned it if they thought there was an implication of cheating.", "If a comment like that gets you flustered there's probably some truth to it lol.\n\n\n\nThat Is the context I am seing.\n\n\n\nBecause otherwise that is a completely normal thing to say.", "You don\u2019t get out much do you?", "Except, they don't.\n\nPeople in my extended family say this all the time. My brother is tall. How'd that happen? (Mostly are jealous, b/c we are all tiny).  I have really curly hair, when most of them have stick straight hair (until my brother grew his hair long and... heyyy... my dad's hair IS wavy).\n\nAnnoying?  Maybe.  Implying cheating?  Doubtful, by the way it's written and the way OP is reporting it.  Especially from a cousin saying it to him, not an older person (unless this cousin is 20+ years his senior).", "It feels like OP took out long-standing frustration with the family onto the cousin.", "Yeah, people say that to me about my red hair.

Instead of insulting immediately.", "My dad is 1.87, I'm 1.93, my brother is 1.78. He has his nose, his beard, his face, his shoulders. Just not his heigth.

Unfortunately, it's hard to know without hearing how it was said. It absolutely could be either way.", "Yes, however, OP is what, 20? Still pretty young, and yes, technically an adult, but still probably has that impulsiveness. Not really an excuse, but probably an explanation. On top of that, it could be that this has been building for awhile, and this was the straw thar broke the camel's back. Again, not saying it's right, but at the very least a bit more understandable. It really depends on how long this has been going on for, and the severity.", "Fair counterpoint.

My whole entire life I have been asked by friends, strangers, family, and etc., where the red hair came from. I often wonder myself where the red hair comes from. Does that mean my mom cheated on my father? Does that mean that people are insinuating that she is a cheater by asking that? Does that mean I think my mom cheated? The answer is no. Not everyone that asks that extremely common question is an AH.", "If there\u2019s tension with the family, perhaps it\u2019s best for OP to not interact with them for awhile.", "Honestly though, he\u2019s still TA for flying off the handle and not handling his emotions. Being TA is a learning experience and OP is having a learning opportunity right now.", "Not attempting to justify OP's actions, I stated clearly that if the posted interpretation was what he acted on, his response was inappropriate.\n\nI was mostly responding to the comment above, stating it was a completely innocent comment.", "Agreed for sure. Best way to avoid the drama and (potential) hatefulness. On both sides.", "Yeah, I can agree with that. And depending on the context and intent of the cousin, they could be TA as well. I firmly think that this situation probably falls under ESH, minus the mom."]}
