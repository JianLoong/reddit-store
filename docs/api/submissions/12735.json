That's when I discovered he's the kind of person who has multiple consecutive alarms every morning and that he struggles to wake up on time. On the other hand, I am a morning person, and I wake up at the sound of his first alarm even though I only have to wake up at 08:30 or 09:00 AM\n\nThe issue is that he sets his first alarm at 06:00 AM and then sets four other alarms consecutively every 30 minutes. He usually ends up waking up around 8 AM every day and going late to work while I wake up at 6 feeling exhausted. \n\nMy first reaction to this was to calmly talk to him and ask him to set an alarm at a reasonable hour and offer to help wake him up. When I tried waking him up, he was extremely nasty. He would scream and beg and act very offended. Basically, he acts like a child and throws every trick he has at me. So I stopped trying to wake him up.\n\nYesterday I was at the office until around 09:00 PM so I was pretty tired and needed sleep so when I heard the alarm at 06:00 AM this morning I was furious. I immediately started screaming, asking him why he would do that and accusing him of ruining my day. It made me even angrier that he tried to deny it, saying the alarm never went off. Then he tried to give me a hug and comfort me, but I wouldn't have it. I told him instead he should just stop setting the alarm at 06:00\n\nHe was very angry and when he got up he accused me of being abnormal, he said that I'm always starting fights and that I was always hurt or upset crying about one thing or the other and that he's sick of it. He said that he doesn't care anymore and that I can be as upset as I want. I told him to stop with the theatrics and set the alarm at a reasonable hour instead.\n\nI feel childish for the way I acted, especially for yelling. I feel like this is a dumb fight, and I'm not sure if I'm being inconsiderate because I know he has trouble waking up, and it's causing him trouble at work.

It sounds like separate bedrooms might be in order. \n\nYour post reminds me a lot of my own headspace in the first year of my current relationship. My partner *also* sets consecutive alarms\u2014 and that shit is like my kryptonite! He also snores. I am a very light sleeper who has a ton of night terrors and I tend to lash out in my sleep. \n\nAfter a lot of silly, stupid fights, we realized we were constantly at each other\u2019s throats because *neither* of us were getting the rest we needed. So, when and opportunity opened up for a 2BR place, we jumped at it! \n\nHonestly, I credit separate bedrooms for saving our relationship. We still cuddle and are intimate. We spend time together, and bond\u2026 but now we almost never fight. For us, it\u2019s been a net positive! I know it\u2019s not for everyone, but it works for us.

Breaking up would be irrational too", "ESH.\nYou are a couple who will be best served by separate bedrooms. Lots of healthy couples do thst", "I suggest trying every 15 minutes over the course of about 30-45. That is what works for me and my husband. Every thirty minutes won't help bc you are fully falling back to sleep in that time. I do think he may also have a sleep disorder. My husband has sleep drunkenness. It's a real thing. I swear to god I thought he was making it up. We would fight so much about his behavior for him to say he had no recollection of why we were fighting. \n\nThis is actually a hilarious story, once I woke up and realized the dog didn't come into the bedroom and got locked out when we went to bed. She had gotten into the trash. I started cleaning it and my husband was standing over me saying we can do this later. I knew he had to be up for work and I didn't so I said go back to bed and I'll get it. He continued to whine and complain saying we could get it later while I continued telling him to go back to sleep. Eventually I got mad and this devolved into a fight, one that seemed to make very little sense from his side. I finally slammed the bathroom door and when I came out he is sitting on the bed very confused asking why I am mad. I tell him and he has no memory of any of it. He was literally asleep the whole damn time. I called him a liar bc this felt like bs. Eventually, he got a sleep study and got a cpap machine and these bizarre things don't happen anymore. \n\nAll I'm saying is his behavior while sleeping may be fully unconscious and his struggles to wake up may be do to a sleep disorder. The crap my husband used to do in his sleep is wild. He once told my roommate he was gonna fuck him in the ear if he didn't leave him alone. He had fallen asleep on the couch and this came out of absolutely nowhere. It was funny as hell. \n\nI also have had issues with sleep. In college I used to answer the phone and have nonsense conversations with people. MY mom bought me an alarm in high school and refused to wake me up anymore bc apparently I would tell her to go fuck herself in my sleep. I never remembered doing any of this. Honestly, I probably need a sleep study too. \n\nI'm not gonna call anyone an AH. I think you two sleep different and he genuinely needs a sleep study.", "Hes not 12 fgs! Set the alarm for a decent time. NTA.", "No one sucks here.\n\nThis is the exact reason why my grandparents had separate rooms.\n\nEither you can find your own sleeping situation or you can file for a divorce because a person who won't wake up with one alarm won't suddenly get better. They need multiple alarms for a reason. My ADHD husband will *make coffee at 6AM in order to have some, and go back to sleep*. He places a cup on my nightstand for me to have when I wake, and it is normally cold, but it has put him back to sleep nearly 100% of the time, where one cup of coffee would have me buzzing around the house like a bee. We're all different and you may need your own bedroom for your sanity.", "It sounds like after three months of sleep deprived torture, and despite several discussions with him about how his behavior is effecting your sleep you reached your breaking point and uncharacteristically yelled at him - this does not make you an Asshole. If he is entitled enough to think that this 2 hour daily disturbance is normal and thinks your the unreasonable one I\u2019m not sure how you adjust his entitlement without something drastic, but good sleep is a cornerstone for good health etc and you are going to need to drive that change before it leaks into more of your life", "Both the AH. Maybe you can ask him to move to the living room or something after his first alarm? That's what my boyfriend does. His first alarm goes off, he gets up, gets dressed and everything, then goes to lay on the couch for another hour. I hate mornings and this helps us both out.", "NTA\n\nMy boyfriend does this too, with the alarms and I've noticed if we sleep together for a longer time, I -over said time - become sleep deprived. \n\nThis isn't healthy behavior in general. He shouldn't need 4 alarms over the course of 2 hours to get up for his job. He shouldn't have to have more than one or two to get up to begin with and if he continues doing this he will be late. \n\nIt is an incredibly dumb fight, I will tell you that.. Especially since Mr doesn't see how A. It's bad for him and his sleeping pattern and B. He's not the only one in the house. \n\nIs this the first time you've mentioned it or lashed out in this sense?", "ESH. \n\nYou're absolutely allowed to be upset that his alarms are waking you up and cutting into your sleep. I would also be upset, however, as someone who also needs multiple alarms to wake up, it may be his only option if his body refuses to wake up at his first one. \n\nIt may be beneficial to sleep separately. Contrary to popular belief, sleeping apart doesn't necessarily mean you don't love each other. In this case, sleeping apart is *because* you love each other and have different necessities for a good night's sleep and comfort in waking up. Then he can have the multiple alarms necessary for his waking up without disturbing your needed sleep.", "I mean screaming isn\u2019t ideal but I might lose my shit too if I was overtired and then woken for no reason.\n\nCan you move to another room? If he is unwilling to change how long are you willing to live like this? For me this would be a dealbreaker sounds like for you too. Is your husband aware that this inconsiderate and selfish alarm system might be the end of your marriage?", "NTA. Next time hold the first alarm directly to his ears and ask him if he hears something.", "NAH/YTA It sounds like you handled everything pretty well at first. When he threw a tantrum that made you stop waking him up, that would have been a reason for another conversation. Letting someone know how horrible they are when you wake them could help them realize and work on it. Nobody is perfect, but they can't get better if you don't give them a chance.", "100% YTA, \"ruined your day.\"   \n\n\nbeing tired makes people childish, so you were right to feel it was childish, but YTA because how you describe your issues and focus solely on yourself.", "YTA kind of. You know he wakes up differently than you so how is that his fault? You also say he's an extremely nasty man with childlike behavior and then go on screaming tirades at him. What do you actually like about your relationship? Your \"solution\" is just to change him to be like you and that is kinda toxic. On the other hand, I understand being upset at being woken up by such an early alarm when you're tired.

Unfortunately this has trained my body to want that extra hour in bed to relax. Getting up immediately just makes me so cranky now. So now when I wake up in the morning I need an hour in bed to doze to really feel refreshed for the day. I wonder if doing these extra alarms is doing that to him.

I dont understand how people can be so inconsiderate.

I have to set multiple alarms like this, because my sleep is so deep, nothing else works and I have tried many different waking up methods. It's not that uncommon either for people who have very deep sleep. Edit: I don't hear my first four alarms at all, that's how deep my sleep is.\n\nI think sleeping in another room is the solution and tbh, it's generally a good concept for couples/married couples, because not everyone has the same sleep pattern and behaviour. It's not reasonable for him to not try to find a solution with her, but it's also unreasonable to expect him sitting less alarms and most likely guarantee to be late for work more than he already is.\n\nEdit: edit \u00b3: Clickbait has clickbaited me.  ~~the average American sets 4 different alarms minimum to wake up.

The mother refused to send his medication to the school, so the staff would give it to him.\n\nThe moral is: usually things that give us energy, help people with ADHD to remain focused/calm.", "That would be ESH = everyone sucks here", "At first, I spoke calmly. I explained that, unlike him, I can't really go back to sleep and that it messes up my day. So we tried me waking him up, and when that didn't work, we had another conversation.\n\nHe opened up about struggling to wake up since he was younger. I suggested that he needs 8 to 9 hours of sleep, so that means sleeping around 11 or 11:30. He called me unrealistic.\n I also suggested a warm shower and a bedtime routine like going on a walk and other things that I do that help me be a good sleeper he rejected those. He basically thinks these things are stupid because the problem is psychological. I disagree because I think these things can affect each other.\n\nHe used to start the alarm at 05:30 am with birds chirping. He stopped that now.

I can see how multiple alarms all at once increases the volume to wake you up or having a couple, maybe 10 minutes apart gives you some time to adjust to the idea of having to wake up.

What\u2019s the benefit for a heavy sleeper?", "Needing four alarms to get up shouldn\u2019t need to be a thing. Try going to bed earlier (in case it\u2019s an issue with a lack of sleep), sleeping with the curtains open so your body naturally begins to wake with sunrise or getting a different alarm clock (either louder, or one of the sunrise/daylight alarm clocks if the point above doesn\u2019t work for you). \n\nI find too many people use mobile phones for their alarms and get too used to the tone", "Not when the behavior  is unreasonable in the first place, and is causing physical issues with other people. And knowingly waking someone up, several times, hours before they need to be awake is both cruel and physically harmful if the partner can't  get a full nights sleep. Two hours is a BIG DEAL sleepwise for some people.", "Telling someone to stop AH behaviour \u2026 is not AH behaviour.    \n\nTwo hours of alarms to wake up is ridiculous especially when your partner can\u2019t sleep through them.", "\ud83d\ude02", "I think it's a combination of things.\n\nI think he probably does have a real problem.

If he has depression or ADHD, for example, his natural sleep patterns are severely altered from what's typically considered \"normal.\" Sometimes this can be helped by medicating the underlying condition.

I don't know if it would work for him to wake him up, or if it would still wake you up, but it might be something to try, although a little expensive.\n\nAnother option is to sleep in separate rooms, particularly on work nights. Most people believe that not sleeping in  the same room is a sign of a failing relationship, but when people have incompatible sleep needs, the healthiest thing to do might be to sleep in separate rooms when you know the alarms are going to be an issue.

For me, mine are an hour apart. I wake up, but any sleep I try to get back into will be easier to get back out of until I just can't deny waking up anymore.

I do have another alarm set for just in case we had a rough night and want a few extra minutes in bed. Nothing wrong with 4 alarms but they are useless 30 minutes apart.

There are also alarm clocks that mimic the sun rising and slowly get brighter as a way to get your brain ready to wake up before your alarm goes off.", "I also blacked out my windows cause the sun shining around the blinds wakes me up at 3am in summer, so basically I choose when daytime is.\n\nThey usually have a dim down \u201csunset\u201d function, I think it does help me getting to sleep too (major insomnia)", "I think we're  saying the same thing, lol. \"Nobody would be ok with\" being *woken up by another*, not that they wouldn't  be ok with how they set their own alarms.", "Exactly. It needs to be continual. It's not just a one-time thing. Husband's just being a liar.", "She describes it going from \"calm\" to \"screaming\" which is the verbal equivalent of going from physically \"sitting up straight\" to \"punching somebody\" -- there's a few steps missing. I'm don't see the part where she maybe recorded the whole thing from-alarm-to-tantrum and then \"please explain this.\" Or any intermediate measure to call out the intermediate behavior (denial, lying, etc...). I mean, if she wants to scream because it makes her feel better (and it does for some people) -- then great, but, like I said, not something I respect.", "Yeah. My alarm clock growing up was across the room on the floor, so I had to get my rear out of bed to turn it off, or even hit snooze. But I got up.", "I did this in highschool because I would hit snooze and was late one too many times for my academic standing.\n\n I moved my alarm and then changed the sound from the klaxon to \"babbling brook,\" and that first morning I was up and across the room slapping that thing off and racing for the bathroom because *hello, full bladder!*", "I tried the \u201calarm across the room trick\u201d when I was younger and all it taught me was how to crabwalk Morgan from the Exorcist style across the room while still half-asleep to turn it off. My brother came in one day to tell me to shut the alarm off and found me crouched over it with a totally blank expression", "I will see what I can find!\n\nI don't have another person I share the bed with, just my dog at the moment (whom I surprisingly don't kick out of bed, only humans have I physically thrown out throughout my years, never animals), but he sleeps through my alarms.", "Thank you so much for the helpful suggestions! I will definitely look into it, because obviously, I've had very... awkwardsituations at work where I was late, because I was just so deep in the sleepy world.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11wa1jy/aita_for_yelling_at_my_husband_at_6_am_waking_him/jcxjtwp/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3", "My friends had an alarm that sounded like the police were raiding your house. Sirens, dogs, men shouting \"Open up, this is the police!\"  \n\n\nBut.  \n\n\nAll for naught if you just shut it off and go back to sleep.", "OMG, as a young teen I once babysat for someone who had an alarm that did that stupid trumpet noise, they needed me to watch the kid at a ridiculously early hour until a ridiculously late hour so I just stayed the night both nights. The damn alarm went off every 10 minutes or so for about 2 hours \ud83e\udd2c they never even woke up during that time", "If I set an alarm before I need to get up, I will often snooze/roll over and go back to sleep. I need the pressure of one alarm at the time I have to be up!", "Even with separate bedrooms, alarms can be heard by other people in the house, at least in every house I've lived in.", "So yes, that's a bit more what I would expect -- I admit I haven't read the entire thread and all the comments. That's quite a bit more than she let on in the original post. \n\nI'm still gonna stick with ESH because at the very least I hate it when people do sensational write-ups of things and leave out the relevant details.", ">I dont understand why this isn't more commonplace/acceptable\n\nProbably because most people would need to sell a few internal organs to afford a home with a bedroom for each spouse.", "Drywalls? I know from friends that is very common with drywall. Apartment complexes usually are not drywall where I live, so it hasn't travelled ever too far now was it ever too loud.", "I totally get that you have a hard time with sleeping schedules, I'm in the same boat.\n\nHowever. This dude literally thinks his wife is abnormal for being fed up with him, wait...\n\n[screaming and begging and acting very offended. Basically, he acts like a child and throws every trick he has at her.]\n\n\nAs long as he acts like that, I don't believe he *deserves* any compromising. He is inconsiderate every step of the way. \nI agree that OP needs to find a way to get some proper sleep. But I think that should happen by one of them leaving for a while. The way he is acting about her sleep at the moment (aka not giving a f), imo he doesn't deserve her company.\n\nI guess we agree on the most part, I just think the disrespectful actions of husband should have more consequences? Rather than just making it easier for him and calling it a day. If a fitbit would work for him, great, but that still wouldn't fix his attitude...\n\n\n/I very much appreciate this discussion btw. :)", "Walls in homes and apartment complexes in the three US states I've lived in have always been drywall.", "Yea, that's always the most difficult part, but it's like for me the \"worst case\" solution in OPs situation. Right now I've been suggested so many things I could try, as I sleep like a rock, so OPs husband can try other options too.\n\nBut yea, if the sleep pattern/behaviour differs extremely, it'd be nice to have separate rooms for this for sure.", "In Germany, where I'm from, drywalls are uncommon. Iirc the current flat I live in has concrete walls, which are really thick and block out more noise than drywall. At least that was my experience when I stayed in the US at him aunts house and it was drywall. I heard everything."]}
