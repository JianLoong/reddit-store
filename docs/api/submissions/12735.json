That's when I discovered he's the kind of person who has multiple consecutive alarms every morning and that he struggles to wake up on time. On the other hand, I am a morning person, and I wake up at the sound of his first alarm even though I only have to wake up at 08:30 or 09:00 AM\n\nThe issue is that he sets his first alarm at 06:00 AM and then sets four other alarms consecutively every 30 minutes. He usually ends up waking up around 8 AM every day and going late to work while I wake up at 6 feeling exhausted. \n\nMy first reaction to this was to calmly talk to him and ask him to set an alarm at a reasonable hour and offer to help wake him up. When I tried waking him up, he was extremely nasty. He would scream and beg and act very offended. Basically, he acts like a child and throws every trick he has at me. So I stopped trying to wake him up.\n\nYesterday I was at the office until around 09:00 PM so I was pretty tired and needed sleep so when I heard the alarm at 06:00 AM this morning I was furious. I immediately started screaming, asking him why he would do that and accusing him of ruining my day. It made me even angrier that he tried to deny it, saying the alarm never went off. Then he tried to give me a hug and comfort me, but I wouldn't have it. I told him instead he should just stop setting the alarm at 06:00\n\nHe was very angry and when he got up he accused me of being abnormal, he said that I'm always starting fights and that I was always hurt or upset crying about one thing or the other and that he's sick of it. He said that he doesn't care anymore and that I can be as upset as I want. I told him to stop with the theatrics and set the alarm at a reasonable hour instead.\n\nI feel childish for the way I acted, especially for yelling. I feel like this is a dumb fight, and I'm not sure if I'm being inconsiderate because I know he has trouble waking up, and it's causing him trouble at work.

It sounds like separate bedrooms might be in order. \n\nYour post reminds me a lot of my own headspace in the first year of my current relationship. My partner *also* sets consecutive alarms\u2014 and that shit is like my kryptonite! He also snores. I am a very light sleeper who has a ton of night terrors and I tend to lash out in my sleep. \n\nAfter a lot of silly, stupid fights, we realized we were constantly at each other\u2019s throats because *neither* of us were getting the rest we needed. So, when and opportunity opened up for a 2BR place, we jumped at it! \n\nHonestly, I credit separate bedrooms for saving our relationship. We still cuddle and are intimate. We spend time together, and bond\u2026 but now we almost never fight. For us, it\u2019s been a net positive! I know it\u2019s not for everyone, but it works for us.

Breaking up would be irrational too", "ESH.\nYou are a couple who will be best served by separate bedrooms. Lots of healthy couples do thst", "I suggest trying every 15 minutes over the course of about 30-45. That is what works for me and my husband. Every thirty minutes won't help bc you are fully falling back to sleep in that time. I do think he may also have a sleep disorder. My husband has sleep drunkenness. It's a real thing. I swear to god I thought he was making it up. We would fight so much about his behavior for him to say he had no recollection of why we were fighting. \n\nThis is actually a hilarious story, once I woke up and realized the dog didn't come into the bedroom and got locked out when we went to bed. She had gotten into the trash. I started cleaning it and my husband was standing over me saying we can do this later. I knew he had to be up for work and I didn't so I said go back to bed and I'll get it. He continued to whine and complain saying we could get it later while I continued telling him to go back to sleep. Eventually I got mad and this devolved into a fight, one that seemed to make very little sense from his side. I finally slammed the bathroom door and when I came out he is sitting on the bed very confused asking why I am mad. I tell him and he has no memory of any of it. He was literally asleep the whole damn time. I called him a liar bc this felt like bs. Eventually, he got a sleep study and got a cpap machine and these bizarre things don't happen anymore. \n\nAll I'm saying is his behavior while sleeping may be fully unconscious and his struggles to wake up may be do to a sleep disorder. The crap my husband used to do in his sleep is wild. He once told my roommate he was gonna fuck him in the ear if he didn't leave him alone. He had fallen asleep on the couch and this came out of absolutely nowhere. It was funny as hell. \n\nI also have had issues with sleep. In college I used to answer the phone and have nonsense conversations with people. MY mom bought me an alarm in high school and refused to wake me up anymore bc apparently I would tell her to go fuck herself in my sleep. I never remembered doing any of this. Honestly, I probably need a sleep study too. \n\nI'm not gonna call anyone an AH. I think you two sleep different and he genuinely needs a sleep study.", "Hes not 12 fgs! Set the alarm for a decent time. NTA.", "No one sucks here.\n\nThis is the exact reason why my grandparents had separate rooms.\n\nEither you can find your own sleeping situation or you can file for a divorce because a person who won't wake up with one alarm won't suddenly get better. They need multiple alarms for a reason. My ADHD husband will *make coffee at 6AM in order to have some, and go back to sleep*. He places a cup on my nightstand for me to have when I wake, and it is normally cold, but it has put him back to sleep nearly 100% of the time, where one cup of coffee would have me buzzing around the house like a bee. We're all different and you may need your own bedroom for your sanity.", "It sounds like after three months of sleep deprived torture, and despite several discussions with him about how his behavior is effecting your sleep you reached your breaking point and uncharacteristically yelled at him - this does not make you an Asshole. If he is entitled enough to think that this 2 hour daily disturbance is normal and thinks your the unreasonable one I\u2019m not sure how you adjust his entitlement without something drastic, but good sleep is a cornerstone for good health etc and you are going to need to drive that change before it leaks into more of your life", "Both the AH. Maybe you can ask him to move to the living room or something after his first alarm? That's what my boyfriend does. His first alarm goes off, he gets up, gets dressed and everything, then goes to lay on the couch for another hour. I hate mornings and this helps us both out.", "NTA\n\nMy boyfriend does this too, with the alarms and I've noticed if we sleep together for a longer time, I -over said time - become sleep deprived. \n\nThis isn't healthy behavior in general. He shouldn't need 4 alarms over the course of 2 hours to get up for his job. He shouldn't have to have more than one or two to get up to begin with and if he continues doing this he will be late. \n\nIt is an incredibly dumb fight, I will tell you that.. Especially since Mr doesn't see how A. It's bad for him and his sleeping pattern and B. He's not the only one in the house. \n\nIs this the first time you've mentioned it or lashed out in this sense?", "ESH. \n\nYou're absolutely allowed to be upset that his alarms are waking you up and cutting into your sleep. I would also be upset, however, as someone who also needs multiple alarms to wake up, it may be his only option if his body refuses to wake up at his first one. \n\nIt may be beneficial to sleep separately. Contrary to popular belief, sleeping apart doesn't necessarily mean you don't love each other. In this case, sleeping apart is *because* you love each other and have different necessities for a good night's sleep and comfort in waking up. Then he can have the multiple alarms necessary for his waking up without disturbing your needed sleep.", "I mean screaming isn\u2019t ideal but I might lose my shit too if I was overtired and then woken for no reason.\n\nCan you move to another room? If he is unwilling to change how long are you willing to live like this? For me this would be a dealbreaker sounds like for you too. Is your husband aware that this inconsiderate and selfish alarm system might be the end of your marriage?", "NTA. Next time hold the first alarm directly to his ears and ask him if he hears something.", "NAH/YTA It sounds like you handled everything pretty well at first. When he threw a tantrum that made you stop waking him up, that would have been a reason for another conversation. Letting someone know how horrible they are when you wake them could help them realize and work on it. Nobody is perfect, but they can't get better if you don't give them a chance.", "100% YTA, \"ruined your day.\"   \n\n\nbeing tired makes people childish, so you were right to feel it was childish, but YTA because how you describe your issues and focus solely on yourself.", "YTA kind of. You know he wakes up differently than you so how is that his fault? You also say he's an extremely nasty man with childlike behavior and then go on screaming tirades at him. What do you actually like about your relationship? Your \"solution\" is just to change him to be like you and that is kinda toxic. On the other hand, I understand being upset at being woken up by such an early alarm when you're tired.

Unfortunately this has trained my body to want that extra hour in bed to relax. Getting up immediately just makes me so cranky now.

I dont understand how people can be so inconsiderate.

Most people believe that not sleeping in  the same room is a sign of a failing relationship, but when people have incompatible sleep needs, the healthiest thing to do might be to sleep in separate rooms when you know the alarms are going to be an issue.

And 24% more than once. 53% is higher and more \u201caverage\u201d that Germans don\u2019t use multiple alarms. The purpose of this study was also to find out when German wake up and how many use a smart phone", "He should get help so he doesn't need 4 alarms over 2 hours to still be late when doing what he has to do. This doesn't mean she's controlling him, this means his sleeping pattern is so horrific that otherwise he doesn't wake up. Which. Is. Not. Healthy. \n\nAlso if the boyfriend thinks it's controlling, nothing is stopping him from leaving.. Is it? If he has a problem he can get up out of there and also save OP the sleep deprivation.", "I don't have a partner, but I know people (ex'es too) who slept over and in the same room with me had trouble with me at night. I turn a lot, not only that, people have told me I have literally kicked them out of bed and then took up the whole bed. I occasionally talk in my sleep. Sometimes friends and family have held entire conversations with me. Which I don't remember. \n\nI sleep like a stone and I am a night owl... so if I ever get a partner, we will probably sleep in different beds at least lol Maybe even different rooms, too. Which imo is fine.\n\nSomething like this needs to be spoken about and normalised, that forcing people with very different sleep behaviour to sleep in the same room can actually ruin relationships. It's healthier sometimes to sleep in different beds or rooks to prevent this.", "Thank you for informing me about it being click bait, as I did not know that. I'll edit it out of my post, but in general, my post still remains the way it was nonetheless.", "My wife and I sleep in different rooms because her snoring is just impossible to sleep next to.", "But 53% of the Germans use only one alarm. That\u2019s the majority so your point is also inacurate that the average American uses 4 alarms. Only 1/4 of the Germans use more than 1 snooze.  That\u2019s not the average German", "Yeah, it's important you can sleep too lol No use trying to power through it. You both deserve good sleep!", "Yes, I get that and I have worded it wrongly. What I meant is that a German study shows similar results to my initial comment where I mentioned average American. \n\nBut either way, it does show it's not something that's ultra rare however. That was my main point, which I did not convey correctly. Even if what I said was wrong in some parts, which I admit, my initial comment still stands. People sleep arrangements can be so different that sleeping in the same room is counter-productive to their relationship and that it's okay to sleep in different rooms. I disagree with the way the husband is handling it absolutely, as he does not want to find a solution or try something else.\n\nIn my case, I have tried everything else already."]}
