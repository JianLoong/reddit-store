My mother(62f) took my son(3m) for two days to give my partner and I a much needed break. She proceeds to drop him back off an hour late with his hair 3in shorter.

I feel like shit for saying anything but this isn't the first time she has pulled something like this. She feels more like a coparent than a grandma.

She has not apologized for this either. She has never actually apologized to me for anything...but I digress. \n\nAm I the asshole for telling her to ask my permission next time with anything regarding his body autonomy?\n\nEDIT for MORE INFO: The boundary I tried to set last week was regarding how she treats me in general. I told her when she asks me how I am doing and I give her an honest answer, to not try to immediately fix it but to give me space to speak because she never gives me the option to feel my emotions and mostly steamrolls them. She went into a rage and literally said I don't get to tell her how to treat me, threatened to not help us financially anymore, and hung up. \n\nThe next day she came to pick up my son and entirely ignored the situation like it never happened. This is the day before the haircut.\n\nMe setting this boundary was a response to me calling her last week to inform her of my son's diagnosis of autism. She (surprise) reacted extremely poorly to that both denying he had it by insinuating she knows him better than I do while also accusing me of causing it by taking Tylenol during my pregnancy (which I didn't).\n\nEDIT 2: This is not an isolated event. There was an incident about a year ago where he was hurt accidentally and apparently an ambulance had to come to check him out. It was at a restaurant where she stuck a spinny toy to a mirror on the wall, my son grabbed the toy to pull it off and this heavy mirror came with it and hit him. \n\nThe restaurant manager called the ambulance, not her. \n\nShe didn't tell us about it until she dropped him off the next day and I asked why he had a bump on his head. \n\nThis was a massive deal but I neglected to do anything in response out of fear of her. I was wrong. I see that now. Thanks everyone for y'all's comments. I am going to not allow any unsupervised visits and will go from there.

That way you may realise how abusive and bad what you wrote that she does really is. Go no contact and NEVER NEVER let her near your child unsupervised again. To be honest because of the extent she has gaslight you into feeling bad to consider pulling her up I wouldn\u2019t even let her near them even if your there. It won\u2019t stop her abusing you and him in front of him and you seem too used let her.\n\nThe fact your son had to go to hospital and she hid it and had no intention of telling you. Why are you letting your son be abused and broken like you are and have been. WHY.\n\nI grew up being abused and if anything it made me place hard boundaries that my children would NEVER BE ABSUSED or damaged by my or my husbands abusive family. Hell we cut his family off completely as they didn\u2019t want to accept our Strick rules. My family were desperate to be involved so complied but we still monitored everything. When I did go no contact even though they\u2019d never abused my kids and my kids loved them. My kids told me they always saw how they treated me and hated them for that.
