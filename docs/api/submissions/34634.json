Have you addressed this at all? I hate to jump right to \u201cshe\u2019s cheating\u201d, but this all just seems bizarre and it\u2019s hard to not be suspicious of an affair.\n\nHave you met this new friend? Have you in any way addressed how different your wife has been acting in the last 2 months? Has she explained how it makes more sense to get a hotel room than an uber?\n\nSo many questions, but it sounds like you really need to talk to your wife", "Can you find a sitter for the kids and go with her? See what she says about that, that\u2019ll give you more info.", "NTA. That\u2019s a red flag man. She\u2019s going to call you mean and controlling when you tell her how you feel, just a heads up. Good luck", "Offer to pick them up post clubbing so they can get home safe.", "NTA since y\u2019all have kids, it is not really fair for her to just peace out for the night and leave you with the responsibilities if you aren\u2019t cool with it. I doubt she\u2019s cheating though\u2014 she probably just liked feeling young and having fun", "NTA. Every single guy I know that found himself in this scenario ended up being cheated on.", "Been there. Done that. She started cheating on me with a guy from work. Cut your losses and run dog.", "NTA if she's not cheated yet, she's setting herself up to do so.", "NTA, she's planning on sleeping with someone. Take a cab home", "NTA\n\nAnd you need do something QUICK because your marriage is in trouble. \n\nYou have two children, but she's talking about spending overnight clubbing like she's a college girl. \n\nShe can go out, but do pushback on the overnights.", "What if the idea of hotel  is to keep drinking safely - or have bubble baths or hot tub - or enjoy room service", "You are in a marriage where you don\u2019t trust your wife to go out and have a sleep over? Why are you married?", "Yta", "NAH \n\nI see both sides but I\u2019m the 35 yr old woman that still has sleepovers with cousins and friends lol \ud83d\ude02", "No arseholes here. You're right to be jealous, but equally it's not to say that your wife is planning or even thinking about having an affair.\n\nShe's most likely just enjoying this new experience after 11 years of being a wife and mother. Staying out could very easily be so she doesn't have to get up and deal with the kids in the morning, with a hangover. Or feel bad about staying out late.\n\nWhen I got out, which is rarely, I will usually get a hotel unless its cheaper to get a taxi, purely because it means I'm under no pressure to end my night, don't wake anyone up getting home, and get to sleep in until they turf me out the next day. I do it for the lie-ins, not the opportunity to sleep around.\n\nOne thing is for certain, more than anything else the thing most likely to push your wife into an affair is to sulk about it and treat her like she's already having one. There's nothing wrong with sitting down and talking about it openly, and there's nothing wrong with you feeling worried - you're not really questioning your wife's intentions, you're more questioning your own insecurities and it's OK to seek some reassurance on that.\n\nOf course, she could be fully intending to bounce the bones of the first stud that shows an interest, but here's the thing - if that's her intention, she's going to do it anyway, so there's no point worrying about that. If she's secretly just looking forward to a carefree night and a long sleep in the morning, better to let her tell you that than assume the worst.", "NTA. I\u2019d be questioning the intent of this entire night too if I were you. Sounds like she\u2019s trying to be sneaky, sorry.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not hard to call an Uber home after the club. Only reason your wife is booking a hotel is so she can sleep with someone. She\u2019s planning to cheat if she hasn\u2019t already. \n\nMy guess is she\u2019s already cheated and gotten away with it. Hence she thinks her booking a room with slide too since she hasn\u2019t gotten caught yet and is starting to get arrogant.", "She is planning to cheat. Keep your eyes open.\n\nNTA", "NAH\n\nHer friend may have problematic behavior, and that's fair. \n\nIs it fair to apply that to your wife? Do you think your wife is looking to do you dirty?\n\nI can understand the concern, which is why I refuse to call you the AH. \n\nBut I don't see where I can call your wife one either.", "NTA. This sounds like a weird, pretty radical change in her behaviour and you're not wrong to wonder why. I think you should just sit her down and ask (respectfully) about it straight up.", "NTA, absolutely not, you need to cut this behavior in the bud. This friend is a negative influence. Why does your wife feel comfortable going out with a woman she knows doesn't respect her partner when she goes out? Birds of a feather..

This isn\u2019t how mother and wife\u2019s act.", "She has some nerve to think that is acceptable in my opinion personally I would tell her no and if she does. To just stay there cause she is no longer married. This is not a control action it's her being incredibly selfish inconsiderate disrespectful having zero respect for the marriage and her family. She is not a single girl she is a wife and a mother. Going out with friends once in awhile is one thing but going clubbing and wanting to spend the night at hotel is just not cool. Tell her to take an uber", "I\u2019ll tell it to u straight.\n\nThere were no \u201cstruggles\u201d In your relationship. The ONLY problem was always that wife just simply not attracted to you  But it seems like she didn\u2019t want to come to terms such a harsh truth herself. So she used your forgiving & understanding nature to beat around the bush making up excuses like \u201che doesn\u2019t show me enough love and affection\u201d The problem was never that you didn\u2019t show it, it was simply that she didn\u2019t appreciate it.", "Birds of a feather flock together", "NTA - Productive conversation time\n\n\"Dear.....  This situation is becoming untenable.  So.... whats going on?    Before you say something,  You need to understand 2 things:  a) I can't stop you from doing ANYTHING.  I don't own you.  But understand this plainly,  I do not want you to go out and get a hotel with this person.  Doing so will have repercussions on our relationship.   But I CANNOT stop you.    b)   Also understand that I. am.  not. a. moron.   So.   What is going on?\"", "NTA.\n\nThe worst part is who she's associating with, a woman that disrespects her husband/relationship, by both flirting/'touching' (aka cheating) other men. She just a bad influence on your wife and will only encourage your wife to cheat.\n\nHaving a good time is one thing. You can dance, go clubbing and spend nights with good friends. That lady you wife is with is only going to drag her down and encourage/pressure her to cheat on you, it'll start out little by little and escalate imo.", "NTA. She\u2019s on a slippery slope", "At this stage, NAH. \n\nSo, I feel that there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with what she wants to do. Going out clubbing with a friend and staying in a hotel overnight sounds super fun to me. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that unless there is, you know?\n\nAnd none of us here can tell you what\u2019s really going on. Could be innocent fun, could be something more sinister.\n\nSo it really depends on a) what your concern is and b) whether your concern is warranted. \n\nIs it the change in her personality that you feel might signal she is looking for a different life? You think she might cheat or is planning to cheat? You don\u2019t want to be left with the kids overnight? No specific concerns but it makes you uncomfortable?\n\nI think you two need to talk, and find some acceptable intersection where you each do what you want which should include taking the other\u2019s feelings into account and choosing accordingly.", "No matter what happens, you will be the bad guy.\n\nOffer to pick her up? That means she has to leave \u201cwhen you say\u201d\nFind a sitter and go with them? She will tell you you\u2019re not giving her space and her me time. \nSay you\u2019ll pay for her uber home? Now you\u2019re just finding any reason for her to not enjoy her night. \n\nShe will find a way to turn this all around and make out like you are the problem. \nI feel for you mate. See, I am petty and would hire a sitter and hang around the hilton to spy lol but thats the part of me thats been cheated on coming out. \n\nYour best option would be to tell her youve found someone to watch your kids so that you and a mate can also have a night out with her and if she says no to going along, say its fine and you will just go elsewhere. \nYou will know her intentions based on her response", "NTA.. Sounds like she trying to test some waters buddy. Plus she can always uber home.. fuck that !", "NTA don't jump to the conclusion she cheating without hard evidence, but make sure to pay attention because if she's suddenly changing in behavior it could be a mid life crisis situation where she's getting self confidence from outside sources. That can lead to cheating but doesn't mean it has yet", "NTA \n\nRemember that the environment that she's proposing entering is overwhelmingly full of males who will be trying their hardest to score. AND it's socially acceptable for middle aged women to have sex with men half their age in these times. \n\nThe straw that breaks the camel's back is wanting to spend the night away from home...\n\nYou both really need to discuss this and if she get's defensive about these choices, well...", "Let her Go and get a babysitter for the kids without her knowing. Then stalk her that night.  You'll have your answer real quick.", "NTA. This quick change in behavior after hanging out with this flirtatious co-worker is strange. It may be nothing, but talk with her. You're not being unreasonable at all.", "NTA. She'll be cheating on you within a month.", "NTA \n\nare you kidding????\n\nIs this troll?????", "Not wrong but bordering on being controlling.   Tread very carefully, unless there is a history of cheating.", "NTA\n\nThis is sketchy.", "This comment section is riddled with misogyny. How do any of you losers know she\u2019s planning to cheat? Maybe she\u2019s going through a mid-life crisis. Or maybe, god forbid, she wants to have FUN.

You should've made it as big of a deal as it actually is.", "NTA... \n\nShe has a right to do whatever she pleases, but if that makes her a person you aren't comfortable being with then expressing that and potentially leaving is 100% ok. \n\nNow, let me ask a super serious question. As much as I hate stereotypes has anyone ever been a go to the club a lot and have sleepovers persons and been faithful in a marriage? \n\nAre any of you out there who lived that life and truly stayed 100% faithful?", "He'll no married women don't roll like that where I'm from no overnights or girls night out the human animal is a fickle thing people set themselves up to get cheated on by allowing a scenario a married woman xhouldnt even want that anyway", "Nts", "She\u2019s cheating on you 100%", "She\u2019s doing you dirty.

Hotel over an Uber??", "Absolutely not wrong for feeling \u201cnot ok\u201d. She is 40 and Uber exists. Her co-workers behavior doesn\u2019t matter, that isn\u2019t your wife and she isn\u2019t a 14 yr old, easily influenced girl. She is a grown woman but isn\u2019t a very respectful wife. Great she isn\u2019t drinking and driving, but clubbing at 40 and married, and frequently,  seems like a recipe for infidelity. I would 100% let my husband have some colorful words if he pulled that crap with me.", "That\u2019s a solid no. This is how marriages end and the woman thinks you are hostile and too controlling, but comes back crawling later because she realizes she made a mistake and the happiness from her supposed freedom was very short", "NTA\nAnd yeah, probably a cheater\nEither way, it doesn't end good", "She is several steps down the wrong path.  She softened you with \u201cher friend is touchy and flirty for drinks\u201d you failed that test and she\u2019s going to the next level. \n\nI would draw a hard line, tell her you\u2019ve been patient while she crosses boundary after boundary, ask her if she wants to remain married. When she says yes then say she needs to Uber home within the hour.  After she gets home calmly explain to her the friend is a horrible influence and needs to be completely cut out of her life.  If she fails to acknowledge and refuses to ghost the bad influencer you know she\u2019s a cheater. (Has already it knows she is going to soon).  \n\nTough situation. I am hoping for the best.   \n\nIn my opinion (assuming she hasn\u2019t yet stayed over) is she sent you the signal \u201cI might cheat\u201d the fight that may happen over you asserting she is not going to do that is WAY less risky than the fight after she gets drunk and cheats.  Have the fight right now.", "NTA: I personally wouldn\u2019t even put up with clubbing at that age, especially if alcohol or drugs are involved and the friend is known for being the way you describe.", "NTA to have concerns, especially when it's new behavior. Is she also getting in shape and dressing differently?  Playing devils advocate here. Have you spoken with her and asked what she is getting out of being out and clubbing?  I am a 44, happily married woman, and I go out once a month with friends dancing. To just be myself and have fun, be silly and pretend i am not heading to middle age. I started going out dancing at 40, and it has helped me. My friends and I have grabbed a hotel, so there is no need for cabs, and I can sleep in or do silly sleep over activities like face masks and paint our toes. Being late could be due to cabs at end of the night or having a few drinks, and thinking one more won't hurt. Nothing meant to be hurtful. \n My husband goes golfing with friends, and often they rent out rooms so they can drink and be hungover and sleep in.  It's about trust. It sounds like you don't trust your wife. If your gut is telling you, it's time for the conversation. Don't do it as she is planning an outing. Tell her how you are feeling and where you are afraid this is heading. It can be that she has found someone she can party with and have those moments of just being herself. She is the one to tell you her friends' behavior, I don't think she would say it to get your worried.  Good luck.", "Clearly she WANTS some dick. Maybe she hasn't gotten it yet, but its what she's looking for.\n\nAt the very very least, she's in the club grinding with someone", "NTA, but I no one does that unless they are cheating.

If the club was so far away that this was the only way to have a few drinks, then maybe.\n\nBut with a person she basically just recently met and at a distance where an Uber/Taxi is certainly a lot cheaper than a hotel room, this does seem a bit unusual, if not suspicious, doesn't it?", "Considering half the people jump down every mans throat when he does the same thing going fishing after a child is born?\n\nYes I would tell him he was disrespecting his wife. Just like how that's what the wife is doing here.", "Yes to the first question. The second isn\u2019t relevant to the above.", "Exactly", "In the 11 years of marriage she hasn\u2019t earned any trust? \n\nIf, like some of the comments are suggesting, the OP doesn\u2019t believe there is a friend and it\u2019s actually an affair why doesn\u2019t he ask to meet the friend. Suggest wife bring her round for dinner or meet up for lunch all together so he can find out for sure she exists. \n\nI understand why wife wants a hotel. Hubby is setting a curfew for a grown woman, and getting antsy when she doesn\u2019t get back on time. A hotel will allow her actual freedom to enjoy herself (that doesn\u2019t mean cheat)", "The coworker is female. She\u2019d be sharing a room with her female friend. Not male.", "Because he's all itchy when she's late. So she thought it would make him worry less if he knew she was staying over with her gf in a hotel rather than him waiting up?", "I think it\u2019s that she WANTS to stay in a hotel with her friend overnight, not that she HAS to. It sounds super fun. Doesn\u2019t mean OP has to be okay with it, though.", "He never said this woman cheats. He said she flirts for free drinks. Distinct difference.", "You don't need a hotel for that. I've taken care of our kids when my wife was hungover and vice versa. It's possible without spending a lot of money on a hotel room for no apparent reason.", "Yupppp! Maybe she wants a hotel room so she can hang out with her new coworker friend and have a chill morning and deal with a hangover in a peaceful environment without children", "Well considering average lifespan is around 80, 40 definitely can be classed as midlife\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midlife\\_crisis", "It seems she like is having a conversation about it. OP doesn\u2019t say she insisting on it (or that she isn\u2019t.)", "Well OP did not mention that his wife did that at all. Just that she brought up the idea to him", "How terrible leaving a father to mind his own children?!?", "You go clubbing and stay out overnight all the time when you have kids at home? Whos watching your kids then?", "This! No one is thinking how tired this woman is of just being a mom", "Some people shouldn\u2019t get intoxicated if it causes problems at home. After dealing with bullshit like this too many times I refuse to be with someone who drinks to that degree. I also don\u2019t drink.", "I'm sure mommy suddenly staying out all night and coming home in the morning without explanation is a much better look \ud83e\udd37 come on man.", ">Unless someone has given them a reason not to trust them it is unfair.\n\nBecoming bff's with a cheater, and then changing behaviour, and not coming home at night IS a valid reason...", "or she could come home on time? or message if she's running late? respect is a two way street.", "She could solve that by texting him, letting him know when she's staying longer than planned. You know, like every normal person in the world.", "True, \n\nFlirts with other men and gets touchy with them. Any reasonable person would be happy that their spouse is doing that with others. xD", "Fair I guess I read it as this is what she\u2019s going to do. If it\u2019s still an open conversation that\u2019s fine.", "Nothing wrong with setting a standard that works for you. Every couple should be able to set reasonable boundaries for acceptable behavior. \n\nIt's part of determining if you are a match or not. Just like I couldn't be with someone into illegal drugs. That's an absolute no.", "Also, after dealing with an alcoholic, I also do not want to be with a heavy drinker. I can't go through that again.", "It worked okay with my friends when we went out. But then again, they were very honest with their kids. Nit common, I know. But it is an individual situation.", "I never said they would. But she isn\u2019t cheating. Just saying", "You're deluded if you think the wife's friend flirting with other men and touching them isn't cheating."]}
