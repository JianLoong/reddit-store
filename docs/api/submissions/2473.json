{"id": 2473, "submission_id": "ywvx9x", "title": "AITA for saying I charge a \"scum bag\" fee?", "selftext": "I 23m brought my 6yo nephew to the skate park yesterday because he just got a skate board for his birthday. I have been skating since I was his age so he has always seen me riding and always been super interested. He has used my board a few times and he is actually quite good. I also do amateur photography and what not so I brought my camera with me to get some good shots of my nephew's first time at the skate park to give to my sister (his mom) for her upcoming birthday. It's probably important to note that this skate park is on the large side. It has 6 different bowls, all of different sizes. Easily like 10 vertical ramps, 6 half pipes all at different areas, a few spines and wave ramps. The place is big.\n\nWhen we got there the place was dead. It was around noon (he played hooky from school because it was his birthday). I had him set up at the smallest bowl and he, at this point, was just getting a feel for the board and going down the side that hardly had a dip to make sure he had good balance. I had already taken quite a few candid shots of him at this point. Probably about 20 or so minutes later a group of your typical skater kids who think they own the place show up and immediately start making snarky remarks about a \"little fucking kid\" ruining their spot. Not loud enough for my nephew to hear but loud enough for me to hear. I don't anything at this point because I didn't want my nephew to see that ignorance. I just ignore them and continue taking random shots and helping him do his little trick (he can do like half a kick flip and he was super excited about it- fucking adorable). These skater kids are still making ignorant comments and I, at this point, am starting to shoot them death glares because I am fed up honestly. They weren't even skating. They were sitting down on a half pipe just running their mouths. Besides that, hardly any seasoned skater would be using the tiny ass kiddy bowl that we were in so it wasn't like we were hogging up the place. Every time I look over they are doing \"jerk off\" motions or some weird ass cocky lip curl. \n\nBut at one point one of the guys approached us as my nephew and I were heading out and asked if I was a professional photographer because he saw me taking photos of my nephew and I politely said that I did do photography but I am in no way a professional. He yells back to his friends with the \"dude, this guy is a photographer\" and then turns to me and says \"Mind taking some shots of us?\" So I said sure, but it would cost them. He asks how much and I said \"Well, I charge a scum bag fee so $500\". Needless to say this guy started \"wigging out\" (his words- he said he was gonna \"wig out\") because I called him a scum bag. My nephew was already in the car so I just got in the vehicle and leave. I tell a buddy of mine what happened afterwards and he says I am an AH because it was unnecessary and that every skater gets pissed when kids are taking up the skate park so I shouldn't have expected anything less.
