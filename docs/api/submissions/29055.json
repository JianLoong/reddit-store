You are redoing your youngest's room out of necessity, not because you wanted to spoil them. \n\nPretty sure your oldest wouldn't want to see most of her stuff ruined in order to get her room redone...", "NTA this isn't a \"Oh let me spoil the baby\" moment, this is \"Damn the little one's room got destroyed.  Have to renovate.\"", "info: How old are they both? Are they both shared kids with your ex and do they have rooms at their home or just yours? Is redoing rooms something that you have discussed with anyone up until now (eg does your oldest have furniture they have been wanting replaced for a while)", "NTA. A flood is an incident that requires action. Discuss with the oldest when you will refurbish her room.", "NTA.\n\nAnd your oldest isn't really AH either.  It's human nature for most kids to want to get something when someone else is getting something. \n\nYour ex is a huge AH for not understanding when a child is overreaching.  And should never get involved in your household decisions anyway.  Ever.\n\nIt's a waste of money to replace both bedrooms when only one flooded.  It wouldn't be fair to the younger to just give them the elder's stuff and get new stuff for the elder.  But it might be possible to compromise and give younger a mix of new stuff and stuff from the elder's room.  That way both get some new stuff.", "NAH. Youngest needs new furniture but I can also see why oldest is a little jealous.", "NTA. Unless you are very wealthy, replacing the furniture of an entire room is not cheap. The water damage might have developed into mold over time, so an action was necessary to prevent health problems. It seems the older sibling didn't even complain about their furniture until they saw what was happening in the younger sibling's room. So this seems rooted in jealousy. If your ex is on the older sibling's side, he/she should at least offer to cover 50% of the costs.", "NTA. You might consider where her comments are coming from, though. You say your older daughter is 12. That is about the age where most kids shift from child to teen, and in my experience most have some change in their bedroom furnishings between age 11-13. Not necessarily their furniture (assuming you bought them normal furniture and not little kid furniture when they were young). But things like their bedspread, posters/artwork, etc, and a teen-appropriate desk.", "NTA. If there is nothing wrong with the oldest's furniture and the youngest's was destroyed, you had no choice.", "INFO how old are both children? If the oldest is under 12 I can understand that type of childishness.\n\nAnd how much will replacing the youngest' room cost? Is a huge expenditure for you? Could you afford to do the same for all your kids?", "NTA, but I can see how your oldest would feel a little sad. Maybe a compromise would be to use a couple pieces of furniture from the oldest's room in the youngest's and give each daughter a few new pieces. Like take your older daughter's dresser, put it in your younger daughter's room,  and let the older daughter get a new one. But then allow your younger daughter to pick out her new bed. Giving each daughter a few new pieces would allow both rooms to get a little refresh without having to pay for two complete rooms.", "Not enough info. \n\nFurnitures are \"messed up\" - as in \"no longer usable\" or \"I would have to clean it\"?\n\nWhen was the last time you updates their rooms last time? Because if you renovated youngest's room six months ago and oldest's room five years ago, I can understand their frustration.\n\nDo they have the same father?\n\nYou are not T A for redoing flooded room but it seems that there may be a bigger problem.", "YWBTA because you are buying new stuff, and likely giving the youngest the room she dreams off, while telling the other to live with it.\n\nThe solution might be to compromise: can we use the existing furniture and work together to buy new things so both rooms look nice and more to their tastes? Can you get some stuff second hand?\n\nYou probably don't need to buy it all new, but making an effort in both rooms will make them both feel respected.\n\n>Oldest hasn\u2019t told me anything about upgrading her room before this\r  \n\r\n\nEDIT: She probably believed that was not an option, and she lived with whatever annoyed her in her current room.", "NTA you are not applying favoritism. Youngest's furniture is no longer usable. Depending on how long the flooding lasted, trying to salvage them might be impossible, and it's not like she can stay in a room without furniture.", "NTA, but we all know how kids are so maybe you can do something special for the older child too?", "NTA.\n\nThis was a need, not because the youngest asked or because you felt like it. If your eldest can't understand that, then she definitely has some growing up to do.\n\nIf she's throwing this much of a tantrum, I see her intentionally messing up her furniture in the future so she can have an HGTV makeover herself. Keep an eye on that.", "NTA\n\nSounds like the younger kid had their room ruined by the flood and the oldest has a perfectly fine room. One comment subjected doing something for your oldest so they don't feel left out which would be a nice idea seeing as this is bothering them but there is no real reason to completely change their room if the youngest really needs new stuff for their room.", "NTA - 12 y/o sounds like a Republican in training. Now is a good time to explain why we help people who are dealing with a tragic event and that it is not the same thing as getting special privileges.", "NTA. If your ex is so upset about this then he/she can pony up the money to redo your oldest's room. You aren't doing anything with your youngest's other than making it livable after a flood.", "NTA. You're doing it out of necessity, not favoritism.", "NTA\n\nYou are just replacing things that are water damaged from the flood.  If your eldest's room wasn't flooded and nothing in there was damaged then there is no need to spend money on it.", "NTA.  Redecorate 8 year old's room now.  Tell 12 year old she can redo her room at 14.  Her tastes/choices will totally change in the next 2 years.  What she likes now will be hated at 14.", "NTA\n\nYou are replacing the things because the flood, explain that in a kind way.  Make sure your daughter knows you hear her view, \"Yes daughter, I understand you see her needing things since hers were ruined, and you feel you should have new things too, even though yours is not ruined.\"\n\nMaybe you can give some of your older daughter's things to the younger and replace some, so both get some new things and the older is not left out.", "Nta you're replacing it because it was damaged.", "NTA based on the limited info here... if a room floods, damaged furniture seems more worthy of replacing than un-damaged furniture.", "NTA \n\nThe flood destroyed her room and there\u2019s nothing you can do it. I can see why your ex is your ex", "NTA - This is not favouritism, you are simply doing it because the room got flooded. If Dad is so pissed then tell him he\u2019s welcome to do the other room!", "NTA\n\nYou're replacing flooded and ruined furniture, not spontaneously buying them new shit for the fun of it!", "[removed]", "NTA - you had n choice", "I would say NTA, given the situation you have no choice, but if your eldest feels that you're being unfair, then that's a probem, ever heard about child favoritism? Please google it. Making your kids feel equally loved is important, in order to prevent ill feelings between them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When he says no let your kid know your ex refuses to pay for it.", "NTA. Perhaps a compromise? Some of the eldest's things get cleaned up and moved to youngest and a little bit of new for both?  I often would take pieces on child was no longer interested in and move them to a sibling, a quick coat of paint or new knobs makes it fresh again. That way everybody got new stuff they enjoyed, but I wasn't constantly replacing pieces as they grew. Of course, each kid had favorite pieces that stayed with them, but there was a lot of trading as they grew. Youngest will still wind up with the lions share of new this time, since I'm guessing redo means you have to paint and maybe replace drywall, but a mix and match on new/old furniture might help.", "You are inviting another \u201caccident\u201d to happen in your home.", "NTA - need over necessity. But maybe you can get your oldest a new comforter set or new pictures. Just a small cosmetic change. That can be fairly inexpensive.", "I agree, but in the older kid's mind it probably feels like a baby-spoiling event (the ex has no excuse to be a jerk, but I get why a kid would feel that way)", "I have them 90% of the time. They are 8 and 12\n\nOldest hasn\u2019t told me anything about upgrading her room before this", "That could be a good compromise (depending on the room layouts ofc) OP could give youngest some furniture from the oldest's room and then both could get some new pieces", "Oh it\u2019s going to cost a lot, probably 2000. Mostly replacing the carpet and I\u2019m hoping o find some stuff from the good will instead of buying from IKEA for everything\n\nI can\u2019t afford to redo her room also", "Water damage, the stuff was made out of wood and some molded, some legs were weak and broke and split. I can\u2019t fix it\n\nI haven\u2019t updated there rooms in a while, last time was years ago", "Lmao upgrading rooms was never an option. The room flooded and destroyed her belongings.

That makes this unsafe, and that's why I am focusing in here first.  Once we make LOs room safe again, we can start working on upgrading your room too, but safety first!'", "Maybe you can refresh the older kids' room? Ask them what is bothering them about it, and it might be just the curtains and bedspread are not her style anymore. \n\nI'd offer a little refresh if she can be more supportive of her sibling. Maybe the younger one loves her sisters desk and wouldn't mind taking it and letting the older one have a new desk. Or trade for some toys she's outgrown. Maybe she needs a bigger bed, and the 8 could get her bed. \n\nSlow down and talk it through. Involve the 12 year old and explain the budget. See if she has a good solution.", "in that case NTA at all, but they're not going to understand the pragmatism of the situation (ie from the 12 year old's perspective it's just her sibling getting lots of cool new stuff) is it worth devoting some time to cosmetic changes to her room (a couple of items like lamps, curtains, a plushtoy) so she doesn't feel left out of something that from her perspective looks like an exciting shopping spree and not a necessary flood repair", "Since the one set is gone, you'd just have to find new stuff that matched OK with the old stuff.  That's easier than mixing two existing sets.\n\nI'd say easiest is getting the eldest a new bed (maybe bigger?) and giving their bed to the youngest along with new dresser, etc.  New bed means new sheets, comforter, etc.", "Sounds like no one can say you're being blatantly unfair, this is _necessity._\n\nNTA\n\nBad things happen, but the fix can't always be shared.", "So maybe you should make plans to renovate oldest's room in a year or so?  You didn't write how old they are, but if the oldest is, let's say, 14, and their room didn't change since they were 9, it needs update. Make a plan, let them make some decisions, choose color of painting... Before they will decide that the best way to get a new furnitures is to destroy the old one.", "The oldest should get new stuff and youngest should get the hand me downs.
