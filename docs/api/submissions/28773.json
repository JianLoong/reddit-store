{"id": 28773, "submission_id": "176cwn7", "title": "AITA for telling my coworker to leave me alone after my baby shower?", "selftext": "Fake names used:\n\nI (F31) am 32 weeks pregnant with mine and my husband's first child. \n\nI've been coworkers/friends with Claire (F36) since I joined the company five years ago. We've always been quite close but I've been getting increasingly annoyed with her while I've been pregnant and it all came to blows at my baby shower last week. \n\nFor some backstory, Claire has struggled with fertility for years. She suffered from pregnancy loss a few years ago and tried IVF but that failed which led to her marriage ending. I was suportive throughout and tried to be there for her as much as I could. \n\nEverything was okay between us until Claire found out I was pregnant. From the moment she found out, she's become slightly obsessed. She touches my belly constantly, begging to the feel the baby kick and always asks how \"our baby\" is. I hate this and have made a point to say I don't like people touching my stomach apart from my husband. Claire in turn always tells people I don't like anyone touching my stomach \"apart from family\" (which she claims includes her).\n\nEdit: I told Clairenthat I didn't like anyone but my husband touching my stomach. She chose to ignore it. \n\nThere's been other issues but the main issue rose when I had my baby shower last week. My mom and mother in law organised the whole thing but apparently both were bombarded with message from Claire because she \"knew exactly what OP wanted\". She kind of took over the shower and made sure she was sat next to me for the entire thing.  While I was opening gifts, Claire burst into tears, saying how a lot of the gifts were items she would have been given at her own showers if she hadn't had her miscarriages. In the end she had to be comforted by several guests. \n\nAfter the shower I called her up and said that I think she needs to take a step back and I'm worried this is too much for her. Claire quickly fired back saying that she was fine and that the baby \"needed Auntie Claire\". Finally, I'd had enough and said that I really needed her to back off as she wasn't family and I felt like I was being suffocated. \n\nEver since then numerous coworkers have said that I need to apologise to Claire and that I was an asshole for being so harsh with her so AITA?\n\n\nEdit: For those saying I should find a new job, I can't do that because of my maternity pay. I was promoted last year so I'm quite high in our firm and it would take a long time to start again from scratch at a new firm. \n\nI will talk to HR though if I continue to be hounded by co-workers. \n\nFurther edit: If people could please stop saying she's going to steal my baby, that would be great. It doesn't help during what is already a stressful time.\n\nI'm not in the US so we have much higher security in maternity wards. Yes, I have a ring doorbell on my home, we've had it for years. No, Claire does not have a key to my house (no one apart from our parents does) and she has never been asked to babysit. The only people we'd ever ask to babysit are our parents or my husband's sister.", "created_utc": 1697132829, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/176cwn7/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_to_leave_me_alone/", "score": 5086, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The only question I have is whether at any you pulled aside and very clearly explained your boundaries.

She needs a therapist and you definitely need to enforce boundaries for your peace of mind.", "NTA. Claire needs therapy and support, but she doesn't get to ignore your boundaries or requests. It's terrible that she's struggling, but you can't be responsible for her mental stability and she's way too involved in your pregnancy. Painful though it will be for her, she needs firm and clear direction to back off and let you have space.", "NTA\n\nClaire sounds like she's trying to deal with her own inability to have a child by essentially latching onto your child as hers.

Claire is creepy and I would not feel safe around her.", "NTA Your coworker was out of line. She was getting far too involved in your pregnancy and inserting herself where she wasn't welcome.

It's very sad that Claire hasn't healed from her experiences with pregnancy loss and infertility, and I don't blame her, as those are really hard things to go through and there is no defined timeline to \"get over\" stuff like that. \n\nHowever, that doesn't entitle her to use your pregnancy and your unborn baby as vehicles to process her own emotions. What she's doing is not only incredibly annoying and invasive for you, but also super unhealthy for her. \n\nYour coworkers likely only heard some version of the story that sounds like \"I was trying to be supportive of her and her baby and she told me to eff off\". So don't mind them. But the fact Claire is a coworker and she's bringing this personal issue to the workplace is another major asshole move from her. \n\nI would just tell the coworkers that you will not apologize for protecting your wellbeing and your personal life from someone who is invading it, no matter how well they mean, and that they should stay out of your private life matters outside of the workplace since they don't concern them at all. \n\nAs for Claire, you can try to write a letter maybe if she gets triggered easily during conversations (although not sure if leaving a paper trail of the conflict is the best idea, either), but anyway you can try to tell her one more time that you have nothing against her personally but you find her attitude and actions toward you, your unborn child and your family to be too invasive and crossing lines, so you demand her to please stay away and respect your boundaries.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

HR has the companies best interests in mind, not yours. Your co-worker is being super weird, but ultimately you opened yourself up to that.

It's not your problem. \n\nI would suggest setting boundaries now with Claire, before the baby comes, because if Claire is this invasive now, imagine how she'd be after the baby is here. Can you trust her around your kid? I bet she will try to be as involved in the baby's life as you'd let her. That would evolve into Claire trying to have more one on one time with the baby, and try to push you out slowly. \n\nIf you are concerned because she's a friend, maybe try to reach out to her partner or a close family member who can talk to Claire into seeing a doctor or therapist.", "First, you are NTA. Second, you need to take this woman\u2019s mental illness seriously. Grief and loss can make the best of us lose our ability to make good decisions. IMHO, Claire has moved into dangerous territory. I recommend going to HR and saying you are concerned for your physical safety around Claire. \n\nGo in with specific instances of her touching and violating your boundaries with dates and any evidence you can find - text messages, emails, or witness accounts are best here. Focus on the unwanted touching and the total inability to respect your boundaries, both physical and verbal. Be super clear about your goal is - no physical proximity or contact with Claire. I believe Claire has proven that she cannot distinguish between right and wrong and she does not understand that your child is not her child. \n\nIf HR cannot honor your request to have separation between you and Claire, let them know you will be seeking legal counsel about providing a safe, harassment-free work environment. If Claire were a man touching a woman and stalking a woman this, it would be clear sexual harassment. I worked in HR for Fortune 50 companies. Their only concern is protecting the company from legal and liability exposure. They do not want to pay out damages in a lawsuit if Claire becomes violent at work. If they don\u2019t honor your reasonable request to be safe at work, they know they are looking at a huge settlement payout. \n\nThe best thing for everyone involved, including Claire, is to cut off all contact now. I do not think you should be in the same room with her. And I also don\u2019t think it is safe to interact with her in virtual meetings or in digital communications. Hopefully, once she gets some space from you and she is not being triggered, she can see what\u2019s happening and get help. \n\nIt is not your responsibility to get her help or to take care of her. Your job is to protect yourself and your unborn child. The stress this is causing is dangerous to you both already. Don\u2019t minimize this or try to people please or maintain popularity with gossips at work. \n\nIf that doesn\u2019t work, definitely get a restraining order. Present the order to wherever you are delivering or to your team if you will deliver at home. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry this is happening to you and your family.

At my shower.  I know it has been tough for her but she is basically taking over my pregnancy and it is getting too much.

I really want our friendship to continue and want you to be in the baby's life, but with the way you are acting now, I just don't see how that can happen.\" I think it would be wise, but necessary, to apologize for snapping at her, something like \"hey I'm sorry I was harsh the other day, it's very stressful for me that you're not following the boundaries I asked you to.\" Infertility on top of a divorce is incredibly stressful. There's a place here for empathy AND boundaries, but at the end of the day, Claire needs to get help to manage her grief and the only thing you can do about that is end or limit your friendship if she refuses to seek the help she needs.", "Sounds like she is a person who was just stomped on by her friend.

Yes, telling her not to touch your stomach just once should have been enough, but since it wasn't, I'd definitely have continued to repeat myself to her until she got it. I have a friend who went through infertility issues and failed IVFs and it's impacted her life and her relationship with her husband a lot (likely more than I'll ever understand). I'm currently 11 weeks myself and trying to plan out the best way to tell her that won't be super triggering, it's going to be rough either way I imagine. So I can understand how it is to be constantly walking on eggshells around someone, or feeling like you have to protect them even if it's not your responsibility, but I could never imagine telling her to \"back off\". Absolutely your friend was overstepping, but overall her intentions are not to be malicious. I do agree with others that she should be talking to a grief counselor. Maybe you could continue to guide her in that direction? Best wishes for the rest of your pregnancy!", "NTA\n\nBut she must be having a really hard time dealing with this. \n\nI think apologizing for the harshness in your words may go a long way, but you can still stand firm about needing her to give you space.

Congratulations btw!! <3", "There was a movie called the Hand that Rocks the Cradle. Anyway, watch it after the baby is born", "NTA. And document, document, document. Talk to HR for sure. She sounds mentally unwell. Who knows what she is capable of doing\u2026 a lot is at stake so defo do not actively engage but be cold and distant yet polite at the same time.", "Do your coworkers have too much free time? Why are they so involved in your bizness like this is high school? Just curious what kind of company this is? I feel for you; the situation is nuts.", "NTA your other co-workers clearly don\u2019t understand how intense she was getting and over-stepping boundaries. Have likely heard a twisted warped view that you snapped at her out of nowhere after she helped throw you a shower and how cruel it was to bring up hurtful memories for her\u2026 \nTry to maintain polite and co-worker friendly conversation with her and others in workplace but do not let her back in to your personal life.", "NTA, clearly.\n\nClaire obviously has issues and what she did was creepy. You were absolutely right to tell her to cut it off.", "Oh the poor woman. She is going through torture and your necessary steps away from her will make it worse. You must do it though. Shut her out and let her back in only gradually and by qualification. It's for her own good.\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA - she is making you uncomfortable and pressuring you w undue stress. Your coworkers need to understand this as well. It is so difficult enough being pregnant w/o the extra pressure of someone trying to squeeze themselves into it. (I also hated anyone other then my husband who tried to touch my stomach - like creepy and weird. Don\u2019t know why people think it\u2019s ok).\n\nIf she bothers you at work you may need to report her as well or just talk to them about it.", "I would go to HR and tell them that Claire's interest has become a harassment and I need them to put a leash on her.", "Which is the reason why the OP should be extra sensitive and gentle with her. Its oainful wanting a child and not being able to conceive.  I would not call the OP an A-hole because HORMONES but be kind is something I would remind OP.  Apologize.  You know, what you throw out in the universe comes back at you hard.  Do no harm to others but when you do, fix it.", "Yeah as soon as she listed Claire\u2019s age and that the relationship with OP changed when she got pregnant I was like, \u201coh this is going to be a sad story about an infertile lady freaking out at a baby shower or something.\u201d  Which is too bad.\n\nWhat I was not prepared for was \u201cour baby\u201d. Wtf?  That is a gigantic red flag.  This isn\u2019t just grief.  Sitting next to her at baby shower, inserting herself into the planning, titling herself \u201cauntie claire?\u201d  She\u2019s nuts.", "Totally morbid, but my first thought was a couple stories I've read where women have cut out the baby and left the mother to die. One was through Craigslist and another was a friend. Hospitals make it borderline impossible to leave with a baby, but OP needs to be very careful and stay away from her.", "Scrolled this far just to find this comment because she definitely seems like a baby stealer!", "I *have* been compassionate. I've been compassionate throughout her miscarriages, her failed IVF and her divorce. Claire saw a therapist after her divorce as well. \n\nWe're not in the same department anymore, I was promoted last year so she doesn't work directly alongside me.", "Compassion only works when the recipient can accept the boundaries and can understand the needs of the other. It sounds like OP was more than kind (if not too kind for not putting her foot down sooner) but when your boundaries are ignored kindness has its limits. We can't just hope people will seek the help they need because many perpetually avoid it.", "I use an app for pregnancy milestones so I tend to know how many weeks I am rather than months as that's what my app calculates.", "Because usually pregnancy is measured by weeks. So much can change from week to week.", "Absolutely not. Op has nothing to apologize for and that friendship needs to end. Claire is not ok and op needs to set boundaries and protect herself and the baby first. Claire mental health is not her business right now. The child she decided to make is.", "We were close friends. This isn't just Claire thinking we were friends, we genuinely were friends before all of this. \n\n>Without boundaries, it seems like you've given Claire permission to do all these things. You've worked together for years, and she thinks you're close friends. When she says \"our baby\" and \"auntie Claire\", or anything else that made you uncomfortable, did you tell her? How would she know you didn't like it, if you didn't say so?\n\nI did say something. I told her that I didn't like anyone but my husband touching my belly. She chose to ignore that and twist it so she was included. I've told her repeatedly I don't like people touching me and again, she's ignored it. \n\n>It's not cool to go to HR and possibly get Claire fired because you don't know how to speak up for yourself.\n\nI never said I was going to get her fired. I never even thought about speaking to HR until I posted in this thread. I'm still not sure I will say anything as I leave for maternity leave very soon. \n\n>Claire needs therapy, which might be true, but you also need therapy to learn to set boundaries.\n\nShe's had therapy after her divorce. \n\n>If you don't feel the same way, it's your job to say something, not treat her like a crazy person.\n\nAgain, I've never treated her like a crazy person. I've been her friend for five years. There's only so much I can deal with.", ">Take in mind that pregnancy fucks with your hormones.\n\nBut OP (the only one pregnant) didn't act crazy.", ">But don't ask for her to babysit next time because you will and take advantage of her.\n\nI was never planning on asking her to babysit because that wouldn't have been fair on her to be around something she's struggled to have.", "As I've said to multiple people, I *HAVE* compassion for this woman. I've been compassionate throughout her miscarriages, failed IVF and her divorce. I've been a good friend to her for five years. \n\nI am incredibly compassionate towards her but she's starting to concern me.", "Hi Claire, is that you?", "I mean I guess you could apologize for shouting at her first.. but be real with her tho!", "Yess I was going to say this sounds like a lifetime move I\u2019ve seen. Stay away from Claire \ud83d\ude28", "Oh yeah. I\u2019m a crazy true crime addict so I know all about those, it\u2019s insane what some people will do to fulfill their own desires \ud83d\ude05", "Why was she invited?", "She is also very comfortable letting you care for her. She doesn't understand friendships are two way streets of caring, celebrating and sharing. She is still in the mode of being cared for by you, more like a mother or therapist. Her sharing all her issues has led her into believing that you are closer than what you are in reality. She has misinterpreted her place in your life. Keep a good distance from her so she can understand her place in your life. And never let her babysit because that will be misinterpreted too. Good luck with everything.", "Tell her what you just said and make it clear this is your time for your infant and you can't spend this time focusing on her issues.", "Because HR will really only work in interest of the company, maybe it would be helpful to mention not just that this person is inserting herself into OP's life in the context of the baby shower or other non-work related events, but harassing her with unwanted touches at work and is slandering her to other coworkers and unfairly pitting them against her creating a hostile work environment. Which she absolutely is. Given how unhinged she seems and frighteningly possessive, I hope she doesn't retaliate in a worse way than slander. If she does anything even slightly violent, I say go straight to the police.", "I posted this in another comment but I have a wild coworker story too.... I worked somewhere where there were three of us pregnant and two of us pregnant women were married.  An older female coworker glommed onto the single pregnant coworker and was just exceedingly overbearing with her.  She had made plans in her head that single co worker was going to move in with her after she had the baby and they were going to be some sort of family where they would raise the baby together.  Which sounds sweet until you realize that pregnant coworker never agreed to nor even seemed to condone any of it and actually couldn\u2019t even stand crazy coworker.  In the end, crazy coworker even went so far as to convince HR to change pregnant coworker\u2019s address in the system and had all of the HR paperwork, FMLA documents, etc sent to crazy coworker\u2019s own house, where she had also started setting up her own nursery.  It got really weird really fast.  Stay safe, OP, hold those boundaries and trust your gut instincts.  Don\u2019t let pity put you in a bad situation.", "Bcc it to your HR rep", "\u201ctell my co-worker to leave me alone after my baby shower\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s a disparity in the relationship label and the context of the event, the person was a friend not a co-worker. You don\u2019t invite a co-worker to a baby shower, you invite a friend. \n\nSo if you and your friend have an issue outside of the workplace context, HR can only control how that translates to the workplace UNLESS and it\u2019s a big unless, there are concerns for safety. \n\nThere is no clarification of who actually spoke to other co-workers about what has happened, only that they have said how they feel about it. There is no clarity on whether \u2018Aunty\u2019 is was a label used by both of them up until there was a problem, the OP has left some details out here. \n\nAll parties involved need to act with professionalism and if OP and friend/co-worker have acted without boundaries up until this point then yes, it\u2019s going to be a nightmare to put them in now. HR is not designed to manage the personal fallouts of people who have not been able to delineate between their personal and professional life. That\u2019s on grown adults to be able to manage effectively.", "Shit, I'm just a fat dude and it's not okay to touch my belly either.\n\nNo idea why people think they can just touch other people.", "Because she was a friend of mine for five years. My mom invited several of my colleagues who I'm friendly with.", "Hi Claire!  Oh yeah, and don't touch my belly.", "You tell us this wild story but not how it ends. I'm invested now, you can't do us like that.", "And then\u2026?!", "OH \u2026 COME \u2026 ON!\n\nFinish the story I\u2019m dying over here  \ud83d\ude06 !!!", "And HR really consented to this without checking with the pregnant coworker?\n\nThis was such a HUGE overstep I can't even.", "Cool, so if you\u2019re raped by a co-worker outside of work hours then it\u2019s all good? \n\nTell me you don\u2019t work in HR or understand employment laws without telling me you don\u2019t work in HR or understand employment laws.", "What do you get when you unlock all the levels?", "It was an impromptu Cesarian with a set of keys after the mother was abducted by a woman who was desperate for a baby. It happened where I live. The mother died but the baby survived.", "Two things \n\nI provided an exception which was regarding safety and your use of an extreme example is a fallacy and doesn\u2019t do much for your position in the conversation.", "Yeah, and that was based on a true story. A woman literally faked a pregnancy and stole a baby by cutting the woman open with her car key.", "Permanent existential dread with a strong sense of foreboding", "It doesn\u2019t matter what the circumstances are. HR is able to get involved even if it\u2019s an interpersonal conflict where the laws extend to things such as harassment, which is what OP is experiencing.\n\nYou\u2019ve shown your lack of experience in this area.", "I remember when thst happened.  I was in elementary school.  It was all over the news.", "I remember that episode. Horrifying", "From what I understand the OP has not indicated any further contact since asking Claire to back off. OP describes a phone call where she asks Claire to back off, then describes a number of co-workers interpretation. But Doesn\u2019t clarify whether Claire has continued to initiate contact nor if Claire is the person recruiting other co-workers to push her narrative.\n\nI know enough about the law to know that one should never surmise with out thinking about the information they might need to draw an objective conclusion based on facts. \n\nI also know that when the boundaries of interpersonal relationships shift I.e. no distinct conversation drawing the boundaries of the relationship are ever had, then this create a situation where someone may have been acting in a way they didn\u2019t actually know was impacting the other person. Once they know they are absolutely obliged to correct the behaviour without exception, but If OP has allowed all of these things to bother her and never taken active steps to ask the coworker to stop, then yes it will look like an extreme response when she finally says something. \n\nIf these things were happening and OP didn\u2019t feel comfortable, why invite her to the baby shower in the first place. I\u2019m not saying Claire is justified or that what she has done is okay, what I am saying is that mixed messaging and unclear boundaries are a recipe for disaster and that can make HR processes convoluted and difficult to get outcomes. So if people are going to advise to seek HR, OP should also be aware of some of the narratives Claire may present and how this may inhibit a desired outcome."]}
