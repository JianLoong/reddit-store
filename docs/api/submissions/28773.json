The fact that you ahd to tell her more than once to stop touching you and to back off says that she is creepily obsessed.", "NTA it sounds like Claire has some trauma from her own miscarriages and needs to be dealt with in a healthy manner rather then inserting herself into your own pregnancy. The only question I have is whether at any you pulled aside and very clearly explained your boundaries. You mention in your post that you explain you didn\u2019t like anyone but your husband touching your stomach but I wondering if you had any clear conversations about boundaries. \n\nI am in no way excusing her behaviour obviously just curious", "Keep your guard up around her. Idk but she's giving baby snatcher lifetime movie vibes", "Nta - those co workers would sing a different tune if they were in your place.", "NTA but your coworkers need some serious help and you need to keep her far away from your kid.  I don't like what I'm hearing and you need to be very careful.", "NTA and she's not Auntie Claire.  It's okay to say no and keep it business.  It's also okay to start looking for another job.", "NTA she took over your baby shower and got so emotional that your guests had to comfort her. Just reading that makes me uncomfortable. She needs a therapist and you definitely need to enforce boundaries for your peace of mind.", "NTA. Claire needs therapy and support, but she doesn't get to ignore your boundaries or requests. It's terrible that she's struggling, but you can't be responsible for her mental stability and she's way too involved in your pregnancy. Painful though it will be for her, she needs firm and clear direction to back off and let you have space.", "NTA\n\nClaire sounds like she's trying to deal with her own inability to have a child by essentially latching onto your child as hers.  Sounds like she needs grief counseling.", "NTA. She's definitely trying to live through you -- including receiving all the attention", "NTA. She sounds like a person who dateline would do a special on. Stay away from her.", "Watch out auntie Claire\u2019s gonna kidnap the baby !!", "NTA. You should have been more direct earlier. Claire is creepy and I would not feel safe around her.", "NTA Your coworker was out of line. She was getting far too involved in your pregnancy and inserting herself where she wasn't welcome. It's better you told her to back off sooner than later or she'd be hovering over you after the baby is born.", "NTA she seems like the type that would steal a baby from the hospital tbh", "NTA. It's very sad that Claire hasn't healed from her experiences with pregnancy loss and infertility, and I don't blame her, as those are really hard things to go through and there is no defined timeline to \"get over\" stuff like that. \n\nHowever, that doesn't entitle her to use your pregnancy and your unborn baby as vehicles to process her own emotions. What she's doing is not only incredibly annoying and invasive for you, but also super unhealthy for her. \n\nYour coworkers likely only heard some version of the story that sounds like \"I was trying to be supportive of her and her baby and she told me to eff off\". So don't mind them. But the fact Claire is a coworker and she's bringing this personal issue to the workplace is another major asshole move from her. \n\nI would just tell the coworkers that you will not apologize for protecting your wellbeing and your personal life from someone who is invading it, no matter how well they mean, and that they should stay out of your private life matters outside of the workplace since they don't concern them at all. \n\nAs for Claire, you can try to write a letter maybe if she gets triggered easily during conversations (although not sure if leaving a paper trail of the conflict is the best idea, either), but anyway you can try to tell her one more time that you have nothing against her personally but you find her attitude and actions toward you, your unborn child and your family to be too invasive and crossing lines, so you demand her to please stay away and respect your boundaries.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's not your problem. If she wasn't getting the hint, you needed to be blunt about it.
