I assured him that there would be plenty of option he liked (pasta salad, baked potatoes, soups, beans, lentils, loads of cake\u2026).\n\nIn response, he\u2019d told me he\u2019d just bring some steak for himself to make it \"bearable\".\n\nI asked him not to do that because I think that bringing your own food to a dinner party when there is plenty of food available is fairly rude (obviously, that doesn\u2019t apply to allergies or extremely picky eaters). I found it especially disrespectful because my parents can\u2019t stand the smell of meat, so bringing meat into their household is blatantly ignoring their boundaries.\n\nI explained all of that to him and he got huffy and argued that I didn\u2019t mind him eating meat near me. Yeah, that\u2019s true, but it isn\u2019t about me but about my parents, who have invited us inside their home and just because I\u2019m comfortable with something doesn\u2019t mean that they have to be.\n\nIn the end, he agreed to not take any steak with him but he told me I was being too pushy about our lifestyle and that it was no surprise \"no one liked vegans\" and called me an AH for forcing him to not eat meat (for a single evening).", "created_utc": 1688982137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14vpase/aita_for_forcing_my_diet_onto_my_boyfriend/", "score": 549, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I eat meat, but yeah, going without for a meal isn't going to kill me. I don't see how a host providing dinner is being pushy about a lifestyle.

Not being vegan doesnt mean he HAS to eat meat. He's TA both for expecting meat in a meat free house, AND for trying to bring his own.", "NTA - he sounds very disrespectful. I would start writing up these red flags to see if he's worth this, although after 2 months, this would be enough for me. \n\nAnyone can go one night without eating meat, so I'm wondering if he's starting trauma bonding - which is why you should consider writing this down to see if it's a pattern (this way you don't keep forgiving and forgetting, just because some times are good).", "NTA\n\nIf \"no one likes vegans,\" why is he dating you? \n\nYou set a boundary, he tried to cross it and is sulking because you wouldn't let him. If he cannot acquiesce to a single night without meat, then that is at best exceedingly immature. At worst, he's being rude about you and your family - bringing a steak or any food to someone else's house for dinner unless explicitly invited to bring something is rude.

I would highly recommend calling him out for that and communicating the issue.", "NTA\n\nI always thought it was common curiosity when you went to someone's house you ate what they served, excluding allergies and food sensitivities of course. But apparently I'm wrong on that.\n\nI have a lot of food sensitivities, and do what is called a low FODMAP diet for health reasons. But I don't take food to other people's houses, if I'm over for just one meal. There was one weekend I was at a conference and all I ate was baked potatoes with salt on them because that was the only thing they served most of the weekend that I could eat. Was it terrible yeah but I survived. \n\nI know there is a stereotype of vegans being pushy about their lifestyle, not saying you are, but speaking as a more carnivorous side of the omnivoric human race, if you can't go one meal without meat than the problem is with you and not the \"pushy\" vegans.", "NTA. Why are you dating someone like this though? Seems like every meal with your family will be an uphill. As a life long vegetarian who\u2019s had to make do with sides at parties (or fries at a restaurant) - I have no patience for this. He can eat before which is what many vegans would do if the situation was reversed nos it was a bbq.", "NTA. A guest bringing meat to a house that is strictly vegetarian/vegan is shockingly rude.

If he really can\u2019t go a single meal without making a huge deal out of it, especially since he\u2019s never eaten there, then his rigidity is going to be an issue. Is that something you want to have to deal with constantly?", "NTA, it would be like a smoker going to a non smokers home and insisting on lighting up because they can't  bear not having a cigarette while they are there. If you can't respect the home you are a guest in then don't go there.", "Tell him if he doesn\u2019t like the choices offered to him, he doesn\u2019t have to go.

I eat meat but I don\u2019t understand the people who treat vegan/veggie dishes as though they\u2019re poison or insist that every meal must contain meat. Trying to take food to someone\u2019s house when you know they\u2019re cooking for you is rude, especially if the food you plan to take doesn\u2019t fit the beliefs of the host.

He's not mature enough to be in a serious romantic relationship. Time to dump out, unless adolescent and self-centered behavior is your thing.", "NTA. Your boyfriend needs to get a fucking grip. I genuinely cannot fathom the absolute level of childishness that someone can\u2019t go one meal without meat (without bitching about it) when in reality they often eat non-meat foods and don\u2019t think about it at all!", "Why is he dating a vegan if it\u2019s that much of a problem for him? NTA", "NTA. Even if somebody is a terrible cook or only makes really plain and boring food, it's absolutely not okay to take your own food round their house. You just have to suck it up. That's not a vegan thing, that's a basic politeness thing.\n\nThe fact bringing meat to the household of people who can't stand it would be actively offensive is EVEN MORE of a politeness thing.", "NTA. If he\u2019s being fed good food, he\u2019s got no reason to complain.

I am not by any means vegan/vegetarian but come on people, 1 freaking day is not the end of the world!! Veggies are amazing, some people need to get over themselves.", "NTA. He wants to actually to bring a steak, as opposed to some low-key dish with meat/diary dish because it is not about his needs, it is about making a statement. He is being obnoxious on purpose.", "NTA.\nIt huge red flag just broke up with him. He go to vegetarian house with steak unless he allergy to all dish your mother make is bad move", "Oof.  NTA.  Find someone who appreciates what you like to eat, there are lots of us, even if we aren't vegans.", "NTA, in any way. He's being disrespectful and this will bring issues down the line. Maybe 2 months is still too early to think about that, but once you guys are living together, if he cooks, will he cook you a steak or what? What if you're cooking, will he bash you for serving a vegan meal? He needs to have some level of openmindedness if this relationship is going anywhere.", "NTA\n\nIf it\u2019s really too much of a burden for him not to eat meat for one single meal, he should just not come,", "NTA.  It\u2019s one night.\n\nA 27 year old child\u2026.that\u2019s so attractive.", "Yikes! What a red flag. This isn\u2019t even about the foods we choose to eat. Its about respecting guests and hosts in a social setting. Bringing external food to a catered gathering is impolite (with exception to those with deathly food allergies and intolerance) but bringing a steak to a vegan meal is a dick move. \n\nNTA.

Your boyfriend of two months, calling you an asshole?\n\nIf so: I'm not a native speaker, do you consider this normal or acceptable?", "NTA and this dude is showing you ALL the red flags. I know meat eaters can get easily triggered when faced with the notion of going even one meal without eating an animal\u2019s remains, but this is especially over the top.  FWIW my boyfriend is not vegan and I think the thing that makes it work is that he gets where I am coming from with it and understands that I went vegan out of a desire to avoid causing harm to others as much as possible. Your situation with your BF to me indicates an inability to see past his own selfishness and is frankly so over the top I am having a hard time believing this isn\u2019t totally made up. Like, how could someone think it\u2019s okay to bring a big chunk of dead animal into the home of someone whose lifestyle is built around non-violence?", "NTA\n\nI do not think this relationship is going to work.", "I love meat, but he can survive ONE EVENING without a meat.

It\u2019s not necessary to have meat at every mean, he\u2019s being pathetic. I\u2019m not vegetarian, growing up (and still now) my mother is, my father isn\u2019t. If mother was out, we\u2019d eat a meal with meat. If she was in, we would all eat a vegetarian meal. Because A) we\u2019re eating as a family, B) we couldn\u2019t afford cooking multiple meals, C) the food was (oh my, gosh horror!) lovely and good for you, and D) there\u2019s not a chance anyone would expect vegan or vegetarian person to cook or prepare meat.", "NTA.

Though I am not planning on going full pescatarian myself, I eat what he eats most of the time (just sometimes if we\u2019re out or he\u2019s away I\u2019ll get something with chicken maybe). We still find loads of fun things to eat, and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m missing out at all, but he also doesn\u2019t begrudge me sometimes eating meat or bringing it into the house whenever I want.\n\nYou\u2019re asking for a tiny iota of this - he literally has to eat nice food for an evening, but not a certain thing he particularly likes eating. That\u2019s like someone refusing to eat somewhere unless they get served chocolate cake at some point - it\u2019s very weird and controlling.

You should get him an IV drip with a steak smoothie to make sure he doesn't collapse mid-salad. NTA", "NTA\n\nI know of a much worst situation.  My mother banned cereal or snacks from her house because she has no self control but is borderline anorexic.  Her fiance at the time couldn't stand this, and decided putting a padlock on the pantry was a good solution.  This caused a relationship ending fight when my mother discovered the padlock.  So remind your BF that it could be worst.", "NTA.  BF could have just declined the invitation.

Age 27 is old enough to know this.", "People who eat meat are not carnivores. It is perfectly reasonable and within a normal diet to sometimes eat meals without meat. It is not his dietary requirement that he gets meat, that's not how this works. NTA, he can get over it and eat a veggie meal once in a while.", "NTA. Maybe time to drop him like a hot potato.", "NTA. SRTA. (Surgically remove this asshole) I suggest you break up. How much longer do you really want to put up with this blatant disrespect", "This young man is socially immature and totally obsessed with himself.  If you never want to eat at your folks home again stay with him.  My advice is to run as fast as you can.

You guys are almost certainly not compatible if he thinks it's appropriate to bring meat into a vegan household and whines about you pointing out why he shouldn't.\n\nBe careful that he doesn't bring some anyway or slip some kind of animal products into your / the family's food. I've heard lots of stories about AH's purposely contaminating vegan food to make a point, and the animal products can cause a lot of health issues for long term vegans. Keep an eye out!", "NTA. If \"no one likes ~~vegans~~ people who care about animals\", why is he dating one?

And I certainly wouldn't be so rude as to try to bring steak with me. He can eat meat after or before the party if it's that important to him.\n\nYou're not being pushy at all, you invited him to a party in a vegan household.

It is about being forced to do something he does not want to do or agree with. It is on fish but is this going to be a foreshadowing for the future? No meat at the wedding, holidays in the home?

I assured him that there would be plenty of option he liked (pasta salad, baked potatoes, soups, beans, lentils, loads of cake\u2026).\n\nIn response, he\u2019d told me he\u2019d just bring some steak for himself to make it \"bearable\".\n\nI asked him not to do that because I think that bringing your own food to a dinner party when there is plenty of food available is fairly rude (obviously, that doesn\u2019t apply to allergies or extremely picky eaters). I found it especially disrespectful because my parents can\u2019t stand the smell of meat, so bringing meat into their household is blatantly ignoring their boundaries.\n\nI explained all of that to him and he got huffy and argued that I didn\u2019t mind him eating meat near me. Yeah, that\u2019s true, but it isn\u2019t about me but about my parents, who have invited us inside their home and just because I\u2019m comfortable with something doesn\u2019t mean that they have to be.\n\nIn the end, he agreed to not take any steak with him but he told me I was being too pushy about our lifestyle and that it was no surprise \"no one liked vegans\" and called me an AH for forcing him to not eat meat (for a single evening).\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I\u2019d be annoyed with and embarrassed of him in this interaction.", "The fact that your parents cannot stand the smell of meat means that him bringing it into their household is a massive sign of disrespect.

I had to leave the room once people opened the packaging because the smell was so unnaturally gross. This was a daily occurrence. Accommodating a guest is one thing, but your parents should not feel uncomfortable in their home.

Yes.

They don\u2019t need to eat mushrooms with every meal; they have a varied diet and no allergies.\n\nThey request to bring mushrooms, which you know will stink up your whole house. They request you prepare mushrooms, but the very touch of them repulses you and you don\u2019t want the stinky fungi to contaminate your kitchen. Your guest is perfectly able to eat everything else on the menu.\n\nAre you an AH for refusing to serve mushrooms? \n\nIf your mushroom loving friend hosted a party, but knew how much you hated mushrooms, would it be a bit rude to include something you hate in every dish, knowing you really won\u2019t be eat anything? They could easily prepare a side that doesn\u2019t contain mushrooms, ensuring you have something to eat. \n\nObviously veganism is more complex than this, as is the vegan diet. However, hopefully the comparison sort of highlights the different between a vegan hosting a meat eater, and a meat eater hosting a vegan.\n\nIt\u2019s complex situation.", "Abide by? They are being offered several perfectly normal edible foods. It just doesn't have their preferred one. I'm not being forced to abide by my Chinese friend's dietary restrictions when she serves me Chinese food when I much prefer Indian. People just have a hard on for meat as if it's some protected food class. It's one evening and he needs to get a grip.", ">force them to abide by your dietary restrictions.\n\nSo if someone was deathly allergic to peanuts, you'd insist on them serving you peanuts?", "By this logic you would be okay if someone brought golden retriever steaks to your house and wanted to cook them in your kitchen and eat them at your table? You wouldn\u2019t want to force them to abide by your dietary restrictions would you?", "5 minutes ago you had no idea what plant based was, and now you have made up your own definition lol \n\n\nEverything in the previous post can be defined as plant based", "taken from Oxford Languages:\n\n\nplant-based\n/\u02c8pl\u0251\u02d0nt\u02ccbe\u026ast/\n\nadjective\n\n(of food or a diet) consisting largely or solely of vegetables, grains, pulses, or other foods derived from plants, rather than animal products", "If he normally eats all the things they serve + meat, but won't now simply because he can't have 1 (one) single thing than he is, in fact, an asshole. I highly doubt this man is going to this dinner and only eating his singular steak that he brought.", "So when you said \"able to eat\" you weren't talking about anything that's actually happening. Maybe you should edit your post.\n\n>I\u2019m going to assume you eat meat, but you can\u2019t tell me you\u2019ve never in your life eaten a meal that didn\u2019t contain meat. Jam on toast? Pasta with tomato sauce? Potato salad?\n\nSo you're trying to force veganism onto your BF for an evening because that's your belief. He has no choice in the matter.", "Slaughtering dogs for food is illegal (native American rituals excepted).. Slaughtering a cow isn't. They wouldn't be at my house because they'd be in jail for violating the law.", "[deleted]", "> So you're trying to force veganism onto your BF for an evening because that's your belief. He has no choice in the matter.\n\nWhy can't the boyfriend choose not to go to the mother's birthday party?", "Nobody is being forced to be vegan in this situation. The food at the event is vegan because the hosts are choosing not to center the meal around animal abuse. The BF can eat vegan food, and, assuming his other preferences or allergies have been noted, he is being accommodated. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the same as accommodating a vegan guest at a non vegan event because the vegan has an ethical objection to animal violence and makes the choice not to eat meat. A meat eater does not insist on eat at every meal because of an ethical objection to not eating animals.", "Vegans aren\u2019t able to eat meat without going against their moral beliefs. In my opinion, that qualifies as an inability to eat something.\n\nAnd because I don\u2019t think anyone should be forced to eat something they choose not to eat (animal products for vegans, pork for muslims,\u2026), I believe that my comment reflects exactly what I was trying to say.", "But otherwise, you would be fine with it?", "you mean vegetarians?", "Not eating meat for one meal isn\u2019t veganism.", "So it's a choice but not a choice. Have fun forcing your BF to abide by your chosen dietary restrictions even if accommodating him doesn't force you to break yours at all.\n\nYou literally lose nothing.", "In my OP I mentioned that my parents can\u2019t stand the smell of meat. It makes them sick. Letting him bring meat is sacrificing their comfort.\n\nedit: spelling", "He literally loses nothing eating a single meal without meat??? Have you literally never eaten Mac and cheese? A pastry? a salad? Pasta? Eating meat does not and has never meant that you eat meat with every single meal, it just means that you will/can. \nEating animal products after sustained veganism/vegetarianism can seriously mess up your gut and make you feel sick. \n\nExplain to me what the big deal is about eating a meatless meal. Genuinely it makes zero sense. Other than projecting this weird attitude onto all vegans they simply don't have. They don't eat meat, they don't cook it. Do you expect Jews and Muslims to cook you bacon for every breakfast?? It's ridiculous."]}
