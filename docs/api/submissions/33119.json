{"id": 33119, "submission_id": "18jle7d", "title": "AITA for making my ex wife and her kids live in \u201cpoverty\u201d even though I have money?", "selftext": "I (46M) recently finalized my divorce with my now ex wife Liza (41F). We were only married for 3 years and the cause for divorce was issues with finances. We had separate bank accounts for our own savings and checking accounts for where our salaries went. I did create an extra account for her where I would deposit money in monthly just as fun spending money as I make significantly more and wanted her to have less stress with her finances. Even with this set up, she would consistently go over the limit and would even take lots of cash out of my wallet and personal safe without informing me.\n\nWhen we were married, she and her two kids (18M and 16F) from her previous relationship moved into my house that I own and I paid for them to go to a private high school. Their dad is in their life so they never saw me as anything other than the guy who married their mom, but I understand that because they did meet me much later in their lives and not as little kids. Regardless, I tried to keep a good relationship but neither of them ever wanted that and made me feel like an ATM.\n\nI got a really thorough prenup made before we married, so I basically kept everything I have except for some alimony I have to pay every month. After the divorce, Liza and her kids moved out and I informed her that I have closed the bank account I made for sending her money and I\u2019m going to stop paying for kids\u2019 private school tuition after this school year is over. So that way at least they finish the year out and have a few months to figure out next plans and transferring.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 3 months since then and I got a nasty call from her saying she can\u2019t afford rent anymore so her and the kids have to move in with her mother and basically berated me for \u201ctaking away\u201d the credit card attached to my bank account. Apparently the kids have also had to stop some of their extracurricular sports because she can\u2019t pay for the programs. She said I left her in \u201cpoverty\u201d and she had to apply for government assistance and food stamps.\n\nAlso when we were married I had mentioned potentially paying for her kids college tuition when the time comes, but it was never a set thing. Apparently she still thought this offer was on the table and mapped out how her son just got accepted to his dream school and the cost of attendance will be 80k per year, so she wanted to know how I would be sending the funds for this.\n\nI just told her she\u2019s crazy if she thinks I\u2019m giving up my hard earned money for someone else\u2019s kids I have no ties to anymore and that I covered her bills completely for 3 years so she should have saved her salary then instead of blowing through it on designer items. A lot of her family/friends and her kids\u2019 dad are all calling me saying I need to provide for the kids at least because I\u2019m their \u201cstep dad\u201d and that\u2019s a life long commitment. Also according to them it\u2019s not fair that I\u2019m taking away their opportunities to be at a fancy private school and college especially when I have the money to pay for all of it and keep up their lifestyle to how it was when they lived with me.

That\u2019s some big ass balls right there.", "WTF...  NTA... not even remotely.  You are divorced.  You had a prenup.  The kids didn't consider you their dad.  AND they have their real dad...  Doesn't sound like you adopted them.  I don't see what the problem is.  Legally, you are not responsible for HER kids.\n\nClearly she was bad with money if you are divorcing over financial issues.  No child support was set up.  She married you knowing there was a prenup.  What's done is done.", "So wait, their FATHER is saying that YOU should pay for their school? Wow. NTA. These people see you have money and are taxing you with guilt. No way. So sorry that they see life this way bc it sounds like you gave them every opportunity to be better.", "NTA she can't blame you for not being ATM and making her choices.

It seems you were aware that your money might be a motivation for your ex to entangle herself with you. Your precaution has paid off, so far.\n\nBe prepared, however, to argue in court whether or not you are responsible to pay for her children's future education. Some courts hold that a person can rely on another's promise to pay, and act upon it, and that the promisor must pay. If one of them chooses to pursue the court route, you must lay out documentation to prove that you have never intentionally taken on her children's financial care; only that of your wife; and convince the judge that you've *never* made any offers of future financial help for her children.", "Holy Wow: NTA\n\nHonestly you went above and beyond. Cut contact when you can. This dumpster fire is no longer your issue.", "NTA. Sounds like your ex needs a reality check.

Thank god you had the foresight to insist on a prenup.", "You are a good man for sending those kids to a private school and fueled there fianc\u00e9s to enjoy sports clearly the mother did t deserve it and either did the kids. If she and the father raised them half way decent they would have a treated you like the savior you were for them. In no way should you feel bad. She signed the paperwork and if the kids treated you like an atm especially with their father in their life they didn\u2019t deserve what you did doe them. Now if you came into these kids lives at a much younger age like 4 and they were now 16 or however old I would think you would probably still look out for the kids if they treated you with respect. The fact of the matter is you gave them a better life and they didn\u2019t respect it or the fact you did t have to do any of it in the first place. College lmfao no way especially for ungrateful brats at that age they should understand finances to a point that they should be kissing your butt for all your efforts", "NTA. How stupid of these people that they're still trying to squeeze you dry", "NTA. The entitlement is strong with these ones.", "Ooof. She definitely was in it for the money, wasn't she? I'm so sorry.

She and her dirtbag family are delusional.", "I don't understand why you have to pay alimony after such a short marriage.

I\u2019d bet if those kids treated you better you might feel a lot differently.", "NTA\n\nThe fact she can't handle her own finances in no way means you owe her or her kids anything, especially since those kids have never treated you as a father.", "NTA. You have no obligation to her children. And they should be grateful because you paid for their tuition in a private school. You should be filing a restraning order so they would not harass you.

You were too good to them dude, you were being used from the beginning :( the entitlement of these people is stinky\n\nI hope you find someone that will actually be invested in a healthy, loving relationship with you rather than seeing you as a bank.

Within the a year she lost you, the house she lived in for the last three years, extracurricular activities she was involved in apparently, and will have to change schools at a time when peer supports and relationships are so important. That might be the worst displacement of all \u2014 she\u2019ll be in a new school with just a year or two of high school to go. That\u2019s not fun and once the other kids learn why she left her fancy private school and why she\u2019s suddenly \u201cslumming it\u201d at the public school, there\u2019s a good chance she\u2019ll be shamed and humiliated or pitied and outcast if she\u2019s still invited to or cross paths with her old teammates friends and classmates from the private school and she\u2019ll be bullied and mocked by the kids at the public school too. Yes there\u2019s a chance it might not go terribly for her, but there\u2019s more of a chance it\u2019s going to be very rough going and she\u2019ll be at risk through no fault of her own at a very tough time for a teen girl. And her brother will be away at school and gone, even if it\u2019s not the school he thought and was led to believe he would be able to attend. So your former stepdaughter is the person I feel the worst for.\n\nYes it sucks for your former step son too, but if his mom is now on food stamps and their homeless, he can apply for need based financial aid and has a good chance of getting it as he\u2019s been accepted to his dream school. If he has to take a gap year to work some to try to help support his sister and save a bit more for what the financial aid won\u2019t cover, he\u2019ll be bummed but it\u2019s survivable.\n\nIf your former stepdaughter gets mercilessly bullied and/or depressed, gets pregnant, drops out, or becomes an addict at 16 because of the trauma of the transition from high tone to homelessness and being plopped into a new alienating school after three years in a nice private school with a close knit friend group, will you feel guilty or sad or like maybe just maybe you sort of let her down at a vulnerable time and she is already suffering with the mom she has for her mom\u2019s mistakes.\n\nMaybe the private school offers financial aid too that you could contact the dean about out of compassion for your former stepdaughter and explain the situation and, if your willing, and if your former stepdaughter was happy at the private school and thriving there, see how much assistance or scholarship money she would qualify for based on her changes financial circumstance and consider offering to pay the school for your former stepdaughter\u2019s uniforms and activity fees not covered by the need based aid the school is willing to offer her.\n\nYes there is stigma related to students on financial aid at elite private school high schools. Everyone knows who they are. But sadly these are life lessons and if she\u2019s given a choice between being on partial financial assistance through the school and you making up the rest to get this young lady through private school, you might want to consider it and your accountant or tax attorney may be able to find a way to structure it through the school as a charitable donation to a needs based scholarship fund you establish for kids in this specific situation that could result in a good tax deduction for you. Just a possible thought.\n\nLegally, the prenup you negotiated with your ex doesn\u2019t legally obligate you to pay, but you\u2019re not heartless. You already volunteered to cover the kids private school tuition through the end of the school year, which leads me to believe you are aware of and wished not to worsen the disruption or trauma these innocent kids would have to endure being pulled out of school mid year. \n\nI hope that you will attend the high school graduation for both kids and that you shared some good times with them despite the financial incompatibility between their mom and you.\n\nIt may have been difficult for them to fully trust or bond with you when they entered your live at 13 and 15 and their worlds and lives and live styles and family dynamics changed overnight. They may have felt unsure of where or how they fit in, they may have felt guilty if they liked you too much or bonded with you that would be like being disloyal or betraying their bio dad. Or they just had been broken before when their bio parents broke up and they may have been more apprehensive and self protective and less open because they never felt secure that any love or security they knew would last.\n\nAnd it proved true. Their fears proved true and they were uprooted and displaced again. \n\nRequesting a (former) therapy session with you and both or each of the kids might help them reassure them and apologize that adult choices resulted in tough sad and powerless helpless disorienting and painful times for them, but that you do care for them and that you want them to know you will always hope and wish the best for them and would like to help mentor if they ever need guidance or have a question or idea they want to run by you. Admit that you always knew they had another dad too and that you could never replace them and didn\u2019t want to make them feel guilty or awkward, so you may have held back some and sometimes keep them at a distance, which you now regret.

We were only married for 3 years and the cause for divorce was issues with finances. We had separate bank accounts for our own savings and checking accounts for where our salaries went. I did create an extra credit card for her where I would deposit money in money in monthly just as fun spending money as I make significantly more and wanted her to have less stress with her finances. Even with this set up, she would consistently go over the limit and would even take lots of cash out of my wallet and personal safe without informing me.\n\nWhen we were married, she and her two kids (18M and 16F) from her previous relationship moved into my house that I own and I paid for their private high school tuitions. Their dad is in their life so they never saw me as anything other than the guy who married their mom, but I totally understand that because they did meet me much later in their lives and not as little kids.\n\nI got a really thorough prenup made before we married, so I basically kept everything I have except for some alimony I have to pay every month. After the divorce, Liza and her kids moved out and I informed her that I have closed the bank account I made for sending her money and I\u2019m going to stop paying for kids\u2019 private school tuition after this school year is over. So that way at least they finish the year out and have a few months to figure out next plans and transferring.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 3 months since then and I got a nasty call from her saying she can\u2019t afford rent anymore so her and the kids have to move in with her mother and basically berated me for \u201ctaking away\u201d the credit card attached to my bank account. Apparently the kids have also had to stop some of their extracurricular sports because she can\u2019t pay for the programs. She said I left her in \u201cpoverty\u201d and she had to apply for government assistance and food stamps.\n\nAlso when we were married I had mentioned potentially paying for her kids college tuition when the time comes, but it was never a set thing. Apparently she still thought this offer was on the table and mapped out how her son just got accepted to his dream school and the cost of attendance will be 80k per year, so she wanted to know how I would be sending the funds for this.\n\nI just told her she\u2019s crazy if she thinks I\u2019m giving up my hard earned money for someone else\u2019s kids I have no ties to anymore and that I covered her bills completely for 3 years so she should have saved her salary then instead of blowing through it on designer items. A lot of her family/friends and her kids\u2019 dad are all calling me saying I need to provide for the kids at least because I\u2019m their \u201cstep dad\u201d and that\u2019s a life long commitment. Also according to them it\u2019s not fair that I\u2019m taking away their opportunities to be at a fancy private school and college especially when I have the money to pay for all of it and keep up their lifestyle to how it was when they lived with me.

This will, in all likelihood, bolster any claim by his ex, should she pursue this in court, that he be compelled to continue to pay for the entirety of the children's current private education because it was *his* wish to change their school to a private institution that she cannot afford. Some courts have found that because the child cannot remedy the fact that their providers no longer want to be together, they cannot suffer losses due to the marriage dissolution. \n\n2) He would have to prove, hard-copy documentation, that the money paid for these children's private schooling while in his home was not paid directly by him using his personal signature on any document. If he cannot, or admits he of his own will took on the financial burden of educating them privately, his actions will further the claim any of these children might make by demonstrating that he has a history of dependably paying for the children's education needs as *his* priority. It would also add credibility to their claims that he did tell them he would pay for their higher education.\n\n3) He states that he did in fact say that he would pay for their higher education without any qualifiers such as \"...as long as your mother and I are together at that time.\". Should he be taken up on his offer by any/all of the children, he'll be in a position to either lie his ass off to the court and hope they believe him, or tell the truth and hope for the best from the courts."]}
