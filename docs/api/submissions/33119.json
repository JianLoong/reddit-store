{"id": 33119, "submission_id": "18jle7d", "title": "AITA for making my ex wife and her kids live in \u201cpoverty\u201d even though I have money?", "selftext": "I (46M) recently finalized my divorce with my now ex wife Liza (41F). We were only married for 3 years and the cause for divorce was issues with finances. We had separate bank accounts for our own savings and checking accounts for where our salaries went. I did create an extra account for her where I would deposit money in monthly just as fun spending money as I make significantly more and wanted her to have less stress with her finances. Even with this set up, she would consistently go over the limit and would even take lots of cash out of my wallet and personal safe without informing me.\n\nWhen we were married, she and her two kids (18M and 16F) from her previous relationship moved into my house that I own and I paid for them to go to a private high school. Their dad is in their life so they never saw me as anything other than the guy who married their mom, but I understand that because they did meet me much later in their lives and not as little kids. Regardless, I tried to keep a good relationship but neither of them ever wanted that and made me feel like an ATM.\n\nI got a really thorough prenup made before we married, so I basically kept everything I have except for some alimony I have to pay every month. After the divorce, Liza and her kids moved out and I informed her that I have closed the bank account I made for sending her money and I\u2019m going to stop paying for kids\u2019 private school tuition after this school year is over. So that way at least they finish the year out and have a few months to figure out next plans and transferring.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 3 months since then and I got a nasty call from her saying she can\u2019t afford rent anymore so her and the kids have to move in with her mother and basically berated me for \u201ctaking away\u201d the credit card attached to my bank account. Apparently the kids have also had to stop some of their extracurricular sports because she can\u2019t pay for the programs. She said I left her in \u201cpoverty\u201d and she had to apply for government assistance and food stamps.\n\nAlso when we were married I had mentioned potentially paying for her kids college tuition when the time comes, but it was never a set thing. Apparently she still thought this offer was on the table and mapped out how her son just got accepted to his dream school and the cost of attendance will be 80k per year, so she wanted to know how I would be sending the funds for this.\n\nI just told her she\u2019s crazy if she thinks I\u2019m giving up my hard earned money for someone else\u2019s kids I have no ties to anymore and that I covered her bills completely for 3 years so she should have saved her salary then instead of blowing through it on designer items. A lot of her family/friends and her kids\u2019 dad are all calling me saying I need to provide for the kids at least because I\u2019m their \u201cstep dad\u201d and that\u2019s a life long commitment. Also according to them it\u2019s not fair that I\u2019m taking away their opportunities to be at a fancy private school and college especially when I have the money to pay for all of it and keep up their lifestyle to how it was when they lived with me.

That\u2019s some big ass balls right there.", "WTF...  NTA... not even remotely.  You are divorced.  You had a prenup.  The kids didn't consider you their dad.  AND they have their real dad...  Doesn't sound like you adopted them.  I don't see what the problem is.  Legally, you are not responsible for HER kids.\n\nClearly she was bad with money if you are divorcing over financial issues.  No child support was set up.  She married you knowing there was a prenup.  What's done is done.", "So wait, their FATHER is saying that YOU should pay for their school? Wow. NTA. These people see you have money and are taxing you with guilt. No way. So sorry that they see life this way bc it sounds like you gave them every opportunity to be better.", "NTA she can't blame you for not being ATM and making her choices.

It seems you were aware that your money might be a motivation for your ex to entangle herself with you. Your precaution has paid off, so far.\n\nBe prepared, however, to argue in court whether or not you are responsible to pay for her children's future education. Some courts hold that a person can rely on another's promise to pay, and act upon it, and that the promisor must pay. If one of them chooses to pursue the court route, you must lay out documentation to prove that you have never intentionally taken on her children's financial care; only that of your wife; and convince the judge that you've *never* made any offers of future financial help for her children.", "Holy Wow: NTA\n\nHonestly you went above and beyond. Cut contact when you can. This dumpster fire is no longer your issue.", "NTA. Sounds like your ex needs a reality check.

If she and the father raised them half way decent they would have a treated you like the savior you were for them. In no way should you feel bad. She signed the paperwork and if the kids treated you like an atm especially with their father in their life they didn\u2019t deserve what you did doe them. Now if you came into these kids lives at a much younger age like 4 and they were now 16 or however old I would think you would probably still look out for the kids if they treated you with respect. The fact of the matter is you gave them a better life and they didn\u2019t respect it or the fact you did t have to do any of it in the first place. College lmfao no way especially for ungrateful brats at that age they should understand finances to a point that they should be kissing your butt for all your efforts", "NTA. How stupid of these people that they're still trying to squeeze you dry", "NTA. The entitlement is strong with these ones.", "Ooof. She definitely was in it for the money, wasn't she? I'm so sorry.

She and her dirtbag family are delusional.", "I don't understand why you have to pay alimony after such a short marriage.

You were too good to them dude, you were being used from the beginning :( the entitlement of these people is stinky\n\nI hope you find someone that will actually be invested in a healthy, loving relationship with you rather than seeing you as a bank.

Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***\n\nI (46M) recently finalized my divorce with my now ex wife Liza (41F). We were only married for 3 years and the cause for divorce was issues with finances. We had separate bank accounts for our own savings and checking accounts for where our salaries went. I did create an extra credit card for her where I would deposit money in money in monthly just as fun spending money as I make significantly more and wanted her to have less stress with her finances. Even with this set up, she would consistently go over the limit and would even take lots of cash out of my wallet and personal safe without informing me.\n\nWhen we were married, she and her two kids (18M and 16F) from her previous relationship moved into my house that I own and I paid for their private high school tuitions. Their dad is in their life so they never saw me as anything other than the guy who married their mom, but I totally understand that because they did meet me much later in their lives and not as little kids.\n\nI got a really thorough prenup made before we married, so I basically kept everything I have except for some alimony I have to pay every month. After the divorce, Liza and her kids moved out and I informed her that I have closed the bank account I made for sending her money and I\u2019m going to stop paying for kids\u2019 private school tuition after this school year is over. So that way at least they finish the year out and have a few months to figure out next plans and transferring.\n\nIt\u2019s been about 3 months since then and I got a nasty call from her saying she can\u2019t afford rent anymore so her and the kids have to move in with her mother and basically berated me for \u201ctaking away\u201d the credit card attached to my bank account. Apparently the kids have also had to stop some of their extracurricular sports because she can\u2019t pay for the programs. She said I left her in \u201cpoverty\u201d and she had to apply for government assistance and food stamps.\n\nAlso when we were married I had mentioned potentially paying for her kids college tuition when the time comes, but it was never a set thing. Apparently she still thought this offer was on the table and mapped out how her son just got accepted to his dream school and the cost of attendance will be 80k per year, so she wanted to know how I would be sending the funds for this.\n\nI just told her she\u2019s crazy if she thinks I\u2019m giving up my hard earned money for someone else\u2019s kids I have no ties to anymore and that I covered her bills completely for 3 years so she should have saved her salary then instead of blowing through it on designer items. A lot of her family/friends and her kids\u2019 dad are all calling me saying I need to provide for the kids at least because I\u2019m their \u201cstep dad\u201d and that\u2019s a life long commitment. Also according to them it\u2019s not fair that I\u2019m taking away their opportunities to be at a fancy private school and college especially when I have the money to pay for all of it and keep up their lifestyle to how it was when they lived with me.

This isn't a custody agreement that stays open and the parents can go back to court to revisit whenever they get pissy with each other.  The divorce is done.  She would need to file a new lawsuit and since there isn't a guaranteed payday, she's not going to get legal representation without funding it herself, which will definitely be more of a burden for her than it will be for him.  \n\nThere's also the time sensitive factor here.  The 18 year old is ready to go to college/university now.  It doesn't make much sense to sit around and wait 3 years to determine at the end of a dragged out legal process to find out how much he's going to get for school.  And it doesn't make sense to take out loans for $80K per year unless he's absolutely certain he'd get reimbursed.  So his alternative is to go to a cheaper, more affordable school.  In that case, they have no need to legally pursue a larger amount since he's not going to need it.  \n\nAlso, if the kid is 18 and the promise they're attempting to legally enforce was to him as funding for his own education, his bio parents have no legal claim here.  He might be able to file on his own (obviously he'd had some assistance/motivation) but he'd definitely have to be personally involved in the whole process.  There's a different desire trying to chase after all of these things when you're still a kid, with your own issues to deal with, rather than a scorned ex-spouse who's still mad about having to dial down the lifestyle she expected to enjoy for the rest of her life.  All I'm saying is, he probably wouldn't want to be bothered with all of it.", "If a parent with means can\u2019t be forced to pay for their own children\u2019s college in most states, I seriously doubt that a stepfather of only 3 yrs can.\nMy ex refuses to contribute for our own kid\u2019s college, and there\u2019s nothing the kids nor I can do about it in our state", "Even if he did get held to his \"promise\" to pay for college, I don't see how they can make him pay 80k per year for each kid- it's fairly easy to argue the promise was to help, not fully fund or was supposed to be contingent on maintaining certain grades or for a cheaper school or he had to approve the major or a whole bunch of mitigating factors. I would think the more expensive lawyer he can afford could probably keep him from paying 80k for 4+ years for each kid. Depending on how much money OP has, he could offer some sort of settlement of a smaller scholarship to avoid the hassle of court.", "That only applies if the promise resulted in actions that were otherwise detrimental (detrimental reliance) or the promise was something repeatedly made if it was only some verbal commitment. \n\nA vague mention of paying for college of your step kids once in the past, with you divorcing the spouse and the kids not being yours anyways, does not rise to the level of an actionable claim.", "Did they ever see him as a father figure, or was he just \u201cmoms boyfriend\u201d?", "HAHA! That\u2019s a good one. I guarantee you\u2019re only saying this because OP is a man. People like you would never have this expectation if the OP is a woman.", "Mate, you wrote a bible based on things you got out of your ass, you aren\u2019t as smart as you think you are", "The problem is this: Depending on their Country or State's *Family Court* laws, the ex is very well able to make this claim in Family Court as a custody/child support matter, post-divorce settlement and regardless of signed prenup, on behalf of her dependent child who resides with her, who is under the age of twenty-five and is seeking fulfillment of a promise to fully pay higher education costs. The promise OP made was made prior to either his step-son turning 18, or the young man being able to exercise his option to go to University by successfully graduating high school. Custody/child support issues such as these are not uncommon and can be brought into court after a child has become of legal age. \n\nAdditionally, the payout determined by the Family Court could be ordered rather quickly as the promise was made, if it can be established, the demand is timely and time is of the essence, and the OP has the wherewithal to honor his promise. The young man could begin attending the university of his choosing and incur as many loans as necessary until the payout is effected, then transfer to a less costly college if the payout ordered isn't as lucrative as anticipated.\n\nOne cannot imagine that OP's ex and her children would neglect to make *every* effort to have this generous promise fulfilled, particularly after she's stated their intentions to do so. Why would they not? They clearly don't intend to seek out cut-rate schools to apply to, when they can select finer universities where they can become associated with the upper echelon and move themselves into more powerful circles when they graduate and begin their careers.", "I think I'm dumb.\n\nI'm just not so dumb that I'd marry a woman with teenaged kids that I actually didn't give a shit about.\n\nI'm not so dumb that I'd look someone in their eyes and vow to be by them in sickness and on health then turn around and leave when they remained the same person I made that vow to for 3 years.\n\nPulled out of my ass?\n\nDown votes just mean truth hurts.", "I apologize for misreading your title, which prompted my lightening fast response w/o reading your text. I thought it read \u201cour kids.\u201d \n\nNTA, NTA,NTA", "Nope mate, downvotes mean you thought you made some kind of gotcha moment and commented it feeling all superior, and then everyone agreed that it simply was dumb", ">If you've never helped someone just because, try it, it leaves you with a good feeling\n\nHelp me then. Itll make you feel better about yourself", "Alimony may have been part of the prenup.  A one-sided prenup rarely holds up in court", "My mom has been with my step dad since I was 14 and I'm 38 now and he can be a really great guy.
