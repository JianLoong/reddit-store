My allergist uses a 0-4 point system - 4 means a severe allergic reaction and 0 means no allergic reaction. So I have an allergy level 2 to cats, but I don\u2019t care because I love cats and I\u2019m willing to put up with some discomfort to cuddle with the kitties. On the other hand, other people are so allergic to cats that they\u2019re eyes will swell up and they\u2019ll go into anaphylactic shock when they touch one. \n\nEven if someone doesn\u2019t have an allergy to something their body could have intolerance to it. In my understanding an intolerance is your body having an unpleasant reaction to something, but it\u2019s not as a result of histamines. So it\u2019s not really your job to judge how your sister\u2019s body feels in the presence of a cat. Only she really knows because she\u2019s the one dealing with her body day in and day out. \n\nObviously your sister is not having a life threatening allergic reaction to the cat, but it would have been preferable to tell her about the cat so she could stay with someone else or book a room somewhere. Your parents are asking too much when they say you as an adult living on your own can\u2019t have a cat because your sister might want to stay with you. \n\nESH.

They\u2019ve taken allergy medication and told me they were fine.

I do find several things strange about this story.", "YTA if somebody's staying with you regardless of your personal feelings towards them, you're meant to tell them if you have pets so they can then decide if they want to stay there, also you're not a doctor she might just have a pet hair intolerance, your treatment of her was unfair", "NTA, but you will be if you let me stay with you. She'll harm Jonathan by omission or commission. You can count in it. She needs negative attention. And it will be at you & Jonathan's expense. She would have begun sneezing nearly immediately if she had an allergy, had snot all over her face, broken out in hives, had trouble breathing, all that, & I know this because *I was allergic to cats for many years* until I got over it via exposure forced on me due to a cat showing up at my house in the dead of winter in a city with a kill shelter so I had to keep the lil Himalayan Kleenex-maker 17 years. Please, please do not entertain her shenanigans further by putting your cat in danger. New rules: she never steps over your houses threshold again for any reason. Good luck", "NTA. I know a weird amount of people who fake animal allergies bc they don't like animals or someone's pet. I dated a guy who was \"allergic\" to just one of my three dogs (ironically the most beloved and short-haired one). He later told me he didn't really like that dog, which affirmed it being fake. I'm allergic to cats, and I would know immediately after entering a home with cats bc my eyes would itch, and I'd be sneezing. She's not allergic, and honestly, you don't owe here a thing. You already made a lifetime commitment to that cat; she can accept him or just not come over.", "YTA. The example you gave is bizarre and makes it sound like you don\u2019t respect other people - you can be allergic to uncooked tomatoes only, so it wouldn\u2019t be that strange to still eat salsa. You have no proof that your sister isn\u2019t really allergic to cats (yes, I\u2019ve seen the comments where you add to the original story after people starting commenting that you were the asshole about one allergist supposedly telling your mom she wasn\u2019t allergic - I don\u2019t believe this is the whole story). Regardless, it would have taken seconds to warn her you had a cat, and she could have chosen to stay with you or not. I love cats but would still expect to be informed if friends I was staying with had a cat, the same way I\u2019d expect to know if they had roommates or children. It seems like you have some major issues towards your sister that should probably be worked out in therapy.", "NTA. I hate this. I am actually allergic to cats. I found out the hard way when stroking my friends cat that was sitting on my knee and suddenly I couldn\u2019t breath, hives appeared on my face and my hands came up in big red rashes. I didn\u2019t know what was happening, luckily my friends mum was a nurse and she knew what was wrong and sorted me out. It\u2019s not as bad now as I am older and don\u2019t touch cats but I can tell when they have been in a room, it\u2019s a certain smell in the room, I can almost taste it and then the rashes start.

If she was allergic, she would have reacted to to the fur without noticing. She only reacted when she learned there was a cat, that only happens when someone lies to get their way. \n\nIt doesn't require being an expert to have some knowledge and use it any more that it requires being a pilot to know that if a helicopter is in a tree, someone fucked up. \n\nAnd you can't compare allergies, which are visible even when minor, to depression, which can be completely hidden st all timss. \n\nI have a mild allergy myself and have enough common sense and basic education to know that you can't hide an allergy. But OP isn't the one being an allergist here, you're the one acting like an immune system response is comparable to a mental disease. You clearly know nothing about either of these things if you think you can compare tyem and use that comparison as a counter argument. \n\nI have a couple of mild allergies myself, nothing that can kill, but I know you can't hide an allergy reaction. It's just not how the immune system works. \n\nThe sister only \"reacted\" after being exposed to knowledge of the cat existing, not fur lying around the house. That's because she's not allergic, and anyone with a basic understanding of allergens and common sense knows that. An allergic person doesn't react physically to knowledge, they react to the allergin itself. You can't be allergic to knowledge. \n\nLiars exist, the sister absolutely is one, and it's valid to call it out since liars get people who are actually allergic killed because liars create skeptics or disbelievers.\n\nI don't need to be a mechanic to know that if a new car fails, someone fucked up. I don't need to be an electrician or plumber to know that if water is coming out of an electrical socket, someone fucked up. I don't need to be a programmer to know that if there are glaring bugs, someone fucked up. \n\nYou don't need to be an expert on it to have basic knowledge on a subject. After all, it requires basic knowledge to even go to the doctor to begin with, and it's basic knowledge that determines if an expert is even needed. If someone claims hives but doesn't have hives, that's just lying and doesn't require a follow-up.", "And btw, [OP confirms that the sister was tested. She's not allergic, just an asshole.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vlquo/aita_for_not_telling_my_sister_i_had_a_cat_when/jwvxud9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=2)\n\nSo perhaps you shouldn't make assumptions", "OP doesn't need to diagnose her sister. That was already done by a specialist in allergies (see copied comment: )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My mom and her dad know for a fact that she isn't allergic. They had her tested. I however am allergic to dogs. She wanted a family dog but we couldn't get one. So she decided to make sure I couldn't get a cat.\n\nAnd I'm sorry about your and your brother's depressions. Mental health issues are not being taken serious enough as people can't see them for themselves.\n\nHope you're both allright now.", "I have zero interest in fighting with her. My house and my cat are mine. She was welcome as a guest and would be welcome to stay while she finds an apartment or something. I just won't baby her lies any more.", "It\u2019s cool, you ever get to L.A. send me a messenger and I\u2019ll wipe you up some of the best salsa you will ever taste in your life.", "Wasn\u2019t that a post on AITA a while back? Stepdaughter \u201caccidentally\u201d let the cat out?", "Team OP on this one\u2026sister is batshit and sisters parents are pathetic", "Okay so you're just ignoring the content of my comment to fixate on your sister. Got it. Weird, but okay.", "Okay. This is important. Why didn\u2019t you put it in your original post instead of the salsa comment? So why did your mother support her knowing she was lying?", "I disagree with only one thing that you said.\n\nThere are people who are allergic to knowledge. I've met some.", "Has there been a new kind of allergy testing created that\u2019s 100% accurate? If so I\u2019d love to know!", "Thank you for your good wishes. \n\nJust so you know \u2013 the comment you copied was made to me after I made the above comment. This information should have been in the original post rather than the blithe comment about people saying they are allergic to tomatoes and eating salsa.", "You sound unhinged.", "Yep\n\nHave seen a couple over the years.", "Your comment said \"if you think\" I don't think. I know.", "To keep the peace. If we got a cat and not a dog she would have lost her shit. She was a spoiled kid. I love her and she has grown up a lot but that's why.", "Yeah. The lie detector test. \n\nWhen someone claims they break out in hives only after being exposed to knowledge, but not when exposed to the allergen itself, and they don't have hives, then that means they lied.", "You are splitting hairs just for the sake of being argumentative.\n\nIt would be easier if you just admit \"I didn't tell my sister about my cat because I wanted to trick her into proving she wasn't allergic.\" because it's clear that's what happened here. It seems you got the results you wanted, so why even dwell on it anymore?\n\nAt any rate, my advice about adulting 101 still stands. Inform any guests about your pets before they arrive. It's the bare minimum of decency.", "You sound like an understanding and compassionate person."]}
