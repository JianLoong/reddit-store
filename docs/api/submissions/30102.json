If you told her, she might think you had something to do with it.", "It sounds like you are trying to spare your friends from hurt but Ethan has to tell Noel. You guys are almost in college and he\u2019s got to be able to be an upstanding guy about these situations no better time to start. Y T A if you get involved. YWNBTA if you tell Ethan to be a good guy and do the right thing by Noel and tell her the truth, no need to be mean though.", "YWBTA for getting in the middle. I understand wanting to spare Noel\u2019s feelings but at the end of the day it\u2019s better for everyone if she hears it from Ethan herself. The best thing you can do is be there for Noel if the rejection hurts her.", "I'd encourage you to stay out of this. Ethan and Noel both need to handle their feeling on their own. Ethan can acknowledge Noel nicely but say he likes someone else. The sooner the better. \n\nYou discouraging Noel is not necessary. You never know who is going to like her, down syndrome or not, so don't let your assumption about that get in the middle of her romantic pursuits in the future! Just be her friend and tell her why she's awesome if things don't work out- same as you would for anyone else. \n\nYWBTA", "YWBTA- Ethan may have told YOU that he doesn't like Noel that way but he hasn't told Noel. He needs to tell her directly but kindly that he's interested in someone else and doesn't feel that way about Noel. You need to stay out of it as you telling Noel isn't really going to do anything to fix the situation because she needs to hear it from Ethan and not you.", "Stay out of this mess.  YWBTA for getting tied into a situation that has nothing to do with you.", "YTA - I don\u2019t think this is your place. Surely Ethan himself can kindly let her down. Or possibly could someone clue in a parent that can explain it to her? I understand you don\u2019t want her to be hurt, but I agree with the other person who thinks you should not insert yourself in this.", "YWBTA. There\u2019s no reason for you to be involved in this situation. If Noel asks for Ethan\u2019s number again, don\u2019t just assume. Ask Ethan if Noel can have it. If he says no, tell her Ethan doesn\u2019t want to give out his number. If he says yes, then let them have their own thing. Crushes are innocent and fun but by getting in the middle of this, you\u2019re turning it into a bigger deal than it needs to be.", "It depends on how you tell her. If you say it\u2019s because she has Down syndrome, Y T A. \n\nIf you tell her that Ethan is interested in someone else, therefore is not interested in dating her, totally fine. \n\nNAH.", "Don\u2019t get involved in this. Next time she asks for his number, tell her that you do not give other people\u2019s numbers out for privacy reasons. Change the subject she talks about him. Don\u2019t bring her up to him.", "Why do you want to be in the middle of this?  YTA.", "Yeah, don\u2019t get involved. Let Noel and Ethan work out their own relationship. Just be prepared to be there for Noel if/when she is rejected or hurt. You are a good friend for wanting to protect her and you mean well, but you don\u2019t want to meddle or make things worse.", "YWBTA for getting in the middle. I understand you want to protect Noel, but ask Ethan to be honest. Tell Noel he has a crush on another girl, but he would be very happy if Noel would be friends with him.", "NTA I see you are stuck in the middle already so too late to not be there, but If another asked for Ethan\u2019s number and he said no what would you do?  Say sorry I asked or expect Ethan to take call.  My one would be to respect Ethans privacy and not give out his number and as compassionately as possible pass that message on.  Can you speak To someone in her family honestly?", "I think you have to tell her that \"Ethan\" likes another girl, don't tell her who.  Be vague at first, but if Ethan finds out that this girl likes him back, then \"Noel\" is going to see them together and will have to deal with the feelings somehow. \n\nProbably better if it doesn't come as a complete shock.", "Why are you being a blocker??

This isn\u2019t a situation you should get in the middle of, but there is something you can do for Noel.  A lot of special needs folks can get fixated on a topic or even a person.  When you\u2019re together and she brings up Ethan, redirect her to a different topic.  Find creative ways to change the subject and distract her from her fixation.  Other than that, do nothing.\n\nOn the other hand, if Ethan is having problems, he can quietly let Noel\u2019s parents know she\u2019s fixating on him in an unhealthy way so they can work with her behind the scenes.  Even though she\u2019s 18, a lot of special needs folks get services until they are 21, so him letting her parents know he\u2019s uncomfortable with her obsession can give them some important information so they can work with her on this.  In other words, just because she\u2019s legally an adult doesn\u2019t mean she doesn\u2019t need some parenting help or guidance.", "Don\u2019t tell her \u201che won\u2019t like you back\u201d. Tell her that he likes someone else. It\u2019s not as harsh. People with Down syndrome can find love. Have you seen the documentary on Netflix called Down for Love? You should show it to her. \n\nNAH, but just say it nicer. Not like \u201che\u2019ll never like you\u201d. That\u2019s jarring. \u201cHe likes someone else\u201d is better.", "NAH but get yourself out of the middle of this situation.  Being sad sometimes is a part of life, and even if this will be a negative experience you shouldn't be trying to shelter her from it.  Teenagers get their hearts broken, it sucks but learning from it and growing is as important for her as it is for any other kid.  On top of that though, this isn't something you should be dealing with, it's Ethan's responsibility to explain his own feelings to her.  Console her if she gets upset, help her move on, she'll find someone who will like her.", "YWBTA if you tell Noel yourself, as she would most probably think this is your doing.  Ethan needs to tell her himself.  He's clearly a good guy but, he needs to do it himself.  You're a good friend but doing this would make you an ah.", "YWBTA if you got in the middle of this.\n\nTell Ethan to be honest with Noel. Tell Noel that she needs to ask Ethan directly for his number and that you aren\u2019t comfortable giving out people\u2019s numbers. Be prepared for Noel to be disappointed and sad, but you and Ethan both need to be direct about this.", "thanks", "i phrased it wrong, it's just ethan has flat out told me he doesn't like noel.", "okay. thank you", "that's the thing, ethan has expressed that he isn't interested in getting her number,", "my guy friend isn't interested in dating noel, but he is scared that noel won't talk to him again because she doesn't know how to handle rejection.", "this really helped. i'll do this today.", "But we are all strongly advising you not to be the one to relay this message to Noel.
