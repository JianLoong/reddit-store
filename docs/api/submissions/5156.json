We've been married 15 years, so for our anniversary he basically wrote a comic that fictionized our relationship. From how we met, through some of the struggles we've had, up to where we are now. One of our friends is a professional illustrator and my husband worked with them all year to make the story boards and and illustrate them all, then he had it printed by our friends comic company.\n\nIt's all very nice. And I definitely said thank you. But it's also just so cheesy. He's always been kind of cheesy, doing scavenger hints for Christmas presents, or poems leading up to valentines day. But this just felt so over the top. I just wanted to cringe at every page of this thing. It's not like it was done poorly or anything, it looks like a comic you buy at the store, but, it's a comic. You know? 15 years and he just hands me this comic book.\n\nSo I said thank you, and I read through it. But I didn't really react to it. And when I was done I set it down and we talked about what we would do for our date that night. He seemed fine right then, but at dinner he told me he was really hurt by reaction. He told me how much time and energy he had put into this, and how excited he was for me to see it and see our story written out like this, and just dismissed it.\n\nI told him it just didn't feel like a great 15 year anniversary gift and that I thought it was kind of cheesy. He was so hurt by this that he just paid for dinner and left. He said he needs time to himself. So he slept in the basement last night and went to work this morning and I haven't really talked to him. I don't think it was a big deal for me to respond this way because I didn't really like the gift. I'm just being honest about how I feel. But he obviously thinks ITA. So am I?\n\nAITA? \n\n\nEdit: Yes he got me other gifts. Very nice ones, including very nice earrings. I'm not mad about this gift or disappointed in it even. It just isn't the kind of gift I like and kind of makes me cringe to look through it. I thanked him for the gift and I certainly wasn't going to tell him I didn't like it. But when he pressed me on it I didn't want to lie to him.", "created_utc": 1671485812, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zq4c24/aita_for_not_reacting_more_to_my_husbands_gift/", "score": 388, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He put a year's worth of effort into it. Maybe it's not what you wanted, but it's thoughtful. If you love this man, then you find things about it to praise. You show more appreciation because his feelings should matter. It seems like he puts a lot of effort into showing you that he cares. So many women would kill for that from their partner.

Maybe from now on the two of you don't surprise each other with gifts, but instead mingle funds to get one special thing for the both of you. (My husband and I sometimes give each other a weekend getaway, that kind of thing.) \n\nWorth considering: People often give the kind of gifts they'd like to receive. Have you ever put a lot of time, consideration and energy into a creative gift for your husband--a scavenger hunt or the like? My guess is no, and if it feels wrong to you, then fine...but if you ever DID do something like that, you'd probably make his year.", "So your husband stayed true to form and gifted you with something thoughtful, time-intensive, yet a little cheesy and you told him that you didn\u2019t like it?? \n\nIt\u2019s the thought that counts with gifts and you\u2019ve had 15-years of married life to let your husband know that cold, materialistic gifts matter more to you than the thoughtful gifts that he prefers to give.

There have been a couple of times my husband got me something I wasn\u2019t very enthusiastic about but you know what? The simple fact he thought of me and tried mattered more to me than the gift, and I told him so. Many people have partners that never think of them, ever.

Maybe he needs to find someone a hell of a lot less shallow.", "YTA, this is just horrible.

So if you\u2019re not even that happy for some it\u2019s hard to fake the whole thing. \n\nAnd the main point is that she didn\u2019t complain about the gift.

You should be able to tell your partner how you really feel about something when they have asked you directly. Maybe you could have softened it by saying that you appreciate all the work he put into it - but you shouldn't have pretended to love it. It would be unfair to you both for him to think you loved it and to put that same kind of effort in again in the future.", "Edit: you got other nice gifts and you\u2019re still this picky? YTA.

We've been married 15 years, so for our anniversary he basically wrote a comic that fictionized our relationship. From how we met, through some of the struggles we've had, up to where we are now. One of our friends is a professional illustrator and my husband worked with them all year to make the story boards and and illustrate them all, then he had it printed by our friends comic company.\n\nIt's all very nice. And I definitely said thank you. But it's also just so cheesy. He's always been kind of cheesy, doing scavenger hints for Christmas presents, or poems leading up to valentines day. But this just felt so over the top. I just wanted to cringe at every page of this thing. It's not like it was done poorly or anything, it looks like a comic you buy at the store, but, it's a comic. You know? 15 years and he just hands me this comic book.\n\nSo I said thank you, and I read through it. But I didn't really react to it. And when I was done I set it down and we talked about what we would do for our date that night. He seemed fine right then, but at dinner he told me he was really hurt by reaction. He told me how much time and energy he had put into this, and how excited he was for me to see it and see our story written out like this, and just dismissed it.\n\nI told him it just didn't feel like a great 15 year anniversary gift and that I thought it was kind of cheesy. He was so hurt by this that he just paid for dinner and left. He said he needs time to himself. So he slept in the basement last night and went to work this morning and I haven't really talked to him. I don't think it was a big deal for me to respond this way because I didn't really like the gift. I'm just being honest about how I feel. But he obviously thinks ITA.

It is personal, thoughtful, and took effort. It is super sentimental, but that is kind of appropriate from a husband. \n\nI just have so many questions\u2026.

I\u2019m a history nerd, and my husband spent ages finding every historical event that happened on my birthday, every legend associated with the month I was born and my astrological sign, every famous person I share the date with, and tons of other cool stuff. He typed and formatted it all, including illustrations, and had it printed out. It was so thoughtful and unique. I didn\u2019t gush over it when he gave it to me, because I was shocked by his thoughtfulness, and he thought I didn\u2019t like it. I assured him I did, I was just overwhelmed. I didn\u2019t get diamond earrings, and I was okay with it. My husband is very creative and artistic.  The following year, for Valentine\u2019s Day, he presented me with a bouquet of a dozen paper flowers he handmade and painted.  He said he worked on them during his lunch break for almost 2 months. They\u2019re sitting in my living room, right now, and are still my favorite gift ever.

Can you tell me why someone would take so much time and effort and love for a gift for someone who doesn\u2019t even care like you?", "My husband actually made me something similar to this about our meeting, dating and early marriage just before we had our first child. He was teaching college at the time and had a student who was able to illustrate it after he wrote and gave him the panel ideas. It was SO cute. One of my favorite presents ever.", "Me too! Oh my gosh can her husband talk to my husband and give him some tips/ help?!", "For real. For my birthday one year when we were still together, my ex gave me a painting she had done of one of my favorite comic book characters. I was blow away by both the effort and thought that went into it.", "It\u2019s such an intimate gift - it\u2019s showing the moments *he* values and cherishes.  Those little moments that are so easy to forget, like the first time you bought their favorite snack - it means nothing to *you*, and *everything* to them.  \n\nGosh, I\u2019m now thinking about how I want to make a book for my husband!", "She got him an Australian horn thing he asked for, a sexy outfit for herself, and had sex with him for his gift. Geez\u2026what thoughtful gifts /s", ">couldn\u2019t give a damn about the comic that actually showed who he was, so how again is he an AH at all?\n\nGifts are for the receiver, not the giver.\n\nAfter 15 years, the man is upset about the gift he gave her that he MUST KNOW doesn't interest her. Yes it's a cute idea. FOR A COMIC BOOK FAN. Which this lady very obviously isn't.\n\nThe man gave her a gift for him. She politely thanked him, but he's butthurt because she isn't excited enough over this gift. Which is fucking absurd because he spent all this time and energy on something HE SHOULD KNOW DOESN'T INTEREST HIS WIFE.", "What does liking diamonds have to do with the kardashian...", "He also got her earings. The point of the comic was to show how much they've gone through together and that he thanks her for helping him at his lowest and being there for his highs. Its to show he cares and had been paying attention and loves what they have", "Yeah, and OP bought *herself* lingerie and had sex with him. You know, because she's so thoughtful and generous and, unlike her husband, gets perfect gifts. /s, obviously", "I'm not actually into comic books at all, however that is an incredibly thoughtful and loving thing to do, and it would be the effort and love involved that would make me emotional and appreciate it. \n\nI also don't like cars, but if my other half spent a year workingnwith a mechanic to make me a time line of modle cars from the important moments of our relationship I'd be moved. \n\nI don't like photos of myself, but if he took a year to make a photo album of our life together and also be moved. \n\nIt isn't the thing, its the sentiment behind it that gives the meaning. If you can't understand that then there is something missing in your soul.", "I agree that she would be TA either way, but I was surprised that some other people judged her as N T A which I think they wouldn\u2019t have if it had been clear that she also got an expensive gift. I wanted to point that out to people who might not have noticed. Her husband sounds like a sweetheart and I hope she learns to appreciate him.", "So? She has to love all gifts equally and enthusiastically?", "God I hope you don\u2019t have kids and treat them like this on Christmas too. I can just see you know saying thanks for the macaroni necklace kid and then trashing it in front of them hours later", "I get where you're coming from, but does her being a terrible gift giver mean that she HAS to like something? Likes and dislikes feel like a pretty weird thing to condemn someone over.", "No shit. He put all his love for you into that comic. Did you cry at your wedding?", "Very sweet. My husband and I have been together since I was 14 and he 17. Married over 11 years, together 19. And some of our favorite gifts are scrapbooks we\u2019ve made each other or sweet things like this. OP is majorly TA because not only did he spend a year doing a thoughtful thing, she got earrings too. Like Jesus Christ, what more does she want? Many years my husband and I don\u2019t even do anniversary gifts anymore and take a small trip or go to a fun event to celebrate instead.", "Right?! \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude11\ud83e\udee0", "Yeah, I know I'm not going to be able to be unbiased with this one because the WORK that went into that and the degree to which she doesn't recognize or value that just bums me out so much. There are people out there... this is a terrible way to look at it, but I've read so many r/relationships and r/AmItheAsshole posts where people kill themselves pulling off Christmas and have nothing to open that morning because their spouse didn't bother to do anything -- and is then mad at them for being sad... all those people just say \"I just want a card or something.\" \n\nThey'd absolutely die for something this sentimental. \n\nWe all have things that make us cringe, but this is one of mine. I'm not sure how you come back from it.", "I definitely think it could be a nice gift for people who aren't comicbook fans -- anyone who would value a sentimental gift that took a ton of effort might like this gift. \n\nI also don't see how this is a gift for him? It's not going to be fun for him to look back on if she hates it. He didn't give her a bowling ball inscribed with his name. \n\nBut you would think after 15 years he'd know he'd married someone who doesn't care for something like this. It's a bummer, but I don't think it's quite that selfish.", "Relax, There is nothing missing from my soul. I'm just saying you can't force someone to have a extravant reaction to something they arent to fond of. She says she appreciated the effort. I'm just if you really knew your wife then you would now what to get her.", "Maybe the best anniversary present in the long run. Better late than neven", "That\u2019s amazing insurance that you never leave him. Cause you can\u2019t leave before you know how the comic ends!!", "He sounds amazing. What a great gift.", "This is the most wholesome thing I have ever read this year. Pls except my poor person awards to you and your BF \ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5", "He did. He got her diamond earrings as well. She got him \"some australian horn thing\" and brought herself some lingerie for his present, claiming sex is a gift. So, the same thing can be said about her, only it's way worse because she expectsto get what she wants without reciprocity. She can't be bothered to do jack shit, he wasted a year on a woman who obviously doesn't value him the way he does her. It's pretty sad actually.", "You don\u2019t think she gave any hints of that in the past 15 years?", "Haha, I never even thought about that!", "You've heard of babytrapped, get ready for comic-trapped!", "Aw that is so sweet! Thank you!! :)", "Dude yall need to chill. You know nothing about her or how her reaction truelly was. Reading something and witnessing something is waaay different. Shit talking someone you no nothing about just one event about a gift. The lady doesn't like fricken comics books. You and no one else can judge and no one asked him to spend a year working on it. That was his choice. Have some respect. It's so disturbing seeing these comment shit talk her. This is nothing compared to what some people post on this group."]}
