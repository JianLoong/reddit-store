{"id": 32564, "submission_id": "18d1x2b", "title": "AITA for not wanting to be an aunt?", "selftext": "My sister got pregnant whilst casually dating a guy. He made it very clear that he wasn\u2019t ready to be a dad, but she decided to keep the baby and just be a single parent. She is nearly 40, so I guess she figured it might be her last chance to have a kid. This is all fine - she can live her life however she wants, but ever since then MY life has been impacted by her decision. I\u2019m expected to step in and help her out as the Auntie. Some people would love this, but I don\u2019t like kids and didn\u2019t ever want kids in my life. I find them very stressful and annoying, I\u2019m a quiet person who just wants peace. I planned to enjoy a child-free existence but now a lot of my free time has become kid-centric. What is most annoying is that my sister expects me to spend my holidays helping her take this kid on trips to Disney or other kid-themed places. So not only am I giving up my free time but I\u2019m also having to spend my money on these trips which don\u2019t feel anything like a holiday, more like hard work, to places I don\u2019t want to go and doing things I don\u2019t want to do. I feel I\u2019m basically there to provide free childcare. Also, because she earns a lot more than me, she books expensive hotels that I can\u2019t afford. When I\u2019ve tried to politely decline - e.g using my limited funds as an excuse - I\u2019m treated like I\u2019m being selfish or inconsiderate. On top of all this my sister and I have never been close. She has a quick temper and a sharp tongue and I was terrified of her when I was growing up. I\u2019ve always tried to spend as little time with her as possible because I honestly find her quite toxic to be around - she makes me feel anxious and on-edge all the time. But now that she has this kid, it\u2019s like I can\u2019t escape her. I feel horribly trapped. I\u2019m resentful that there is this unspoken cultural expectation to be a helpful aunt - why is it okay that her decision to be a single mother changes my life? I didn\u2019t get a say in any of this. But how can I tell her that I don\u2019t really want to be involved with her kid without sounding like an asshole, and without alienating the rest of my family (our parents and another sibling)?

No, I can't afford it, no I'm not babysitting - let your sister spin her wheels. If she complains to the relatives complain back - you didn't have a child and if you did you wouldn't spend your free time trying to foist it off on someone else. If your relatives run their mouth thank them for volunteering to go on the next vacation. Why does your sister equate how much you love her kid with how much your willing to do for free?", "Dude, you're being the AH to yourself. You are not obligated to do anything for your sister or her kid, why are you acting like you are? Who cares how she treats you when you don't even want to be around her? Cut her off and block her and any of her apologists. NTA", "NTA, but you should have laid down the law long ago.\n\nYou don\u2019t really get a say in being an aunt. That was your sisters call. You absolutely get a say in what KIND of aunt you want to be, and how involved. \n\nJust tell your sister you didn\u2019t consent to having a kid every time she pressures you. Your family might get upset, but you didn\u2019t. You can\u2019t change an entire culture by yourself, but you can change the expectations of you by setting and enforcing firm boundaries.", "NTA\n\n\"But how can I tell her that I don\u2019t really want to be involved with her kid without sounding like an asshole, and without alienating the rest of my family (our parents and another sibling)?\"\n\nYou don't.  You're right, you can't just say it that bluntly and expect to not get blowback.  You have every right to be as involved or not involved in Aunt-hood as you like, but you can't just wholesale say I don't want to be an aunt.\n\nHow you do it is by learning that the word No is a complete sentence.  Learn it, live it, love it.  It sounds like culture plays a role here and you've been raised to think you owe her your time because she chose to procreate and you don't.  \"No, I can't do that.\"  \"No, I have other plans that day.\"  \"No, actually it's not possible for me to go on that trip.\"  \"I'm afraid that's not going to be possible.\" \"I just can't do that.\"  Resist the urge to apologize or give specific reasons, because that's how they work on ways to trample over them.   Just learn to say no and mean it and know that you don't owe her your time or your money and you don't owe her an excuse or explanation for not volunteering to be free child care.  \"No, I can't do that.\" Eventually, she will stop asking.  She may call you names, she may get your parents to bitch at you, but just keep saying no and eventually they'll get the point.", "First step, do NOT go on that trip. Do something that YOU want to do and start declining. It is her child and if she wants a babysitter she needs to look elsewhere and not at you. NTA.", "You know you don't *have* to do any of this, right?\n\nJust tell her you're not interested, and repeat that when she tries to guilt you. Go NC or LC if you need to, but you're currently being TA to yourself here.", "NTA. \n\nBut I don't get it.  You don't like kids, and it sounds like you don't like your sister all that much either.  So what is the reason you can't just say \"no?\" \n\nIf you want to tread a middle ground of \"less\" involvement, then simply lean heavily on the \"I can't afford it\" theme.  Let her pay for your hotel room, your theme park tickets, even your meals while you are spending time with her and her kid.  Certainly you shouldn't be expected to spend your time AND your money?\n\nAnd be up front with the rest of your family about it.  If they shun you for this, they can take your spot and see how they like it.", "Seems like the real issue here is your inability to grow a spine and just stand up for yourself. \n\nIf you don't want to help her, then don't help her. It's really that simple.\n\nNot your fault she chose to keep the kid and have a child through a man who wasn't even ready. \n\nThough, if she's 40, the guy is most likely around her age so not sure what he was expecting.", "WHAT???  \nYou don't mention your age but you sound more like a 13 year old than an adult. Your sister can have all the \"expectations\" that she wants, that doesn't mean that you have to accommodate her.   \n\"No\" is a complete sentence. Why are you making excuses? Her decision, her child, her responsibility. If your parents and other sibling find that to be a problem then let them step up and help her out.  \nNTA", "Honey-child! Just say NO! Your sister isn't holding a gun on you, is she? If you're incapable of asserting your own wishes, how do you expect to get what you want.", "> I\u2019m expected to step in and help her out as the Auntie.\n\nPeople can \"expect\" whatever they want.

Don't go on the trips, don't provide consistent free childcare. But saying you don't want to be involved in the child's life is an ahole move. Do normal aunt things. Buy Christmas and holiday gifts. Attend the occasional school event. Go out to lunch once in a while. \n\nNot liking kids is not a good reason to cut off your niece. She's still a person and your family member. You don't have to spend tons of money or be the mom's personal assistant to be a decent aunt.\n\nNow if your sister is being rude and you don't want to be around her, that's one thing, but I'd phrase that more as \"You're not nice to me so I'm not going be around\" instead of \"I don't  want to be involved with my niece.\"", "No. a complete sentence.  That is how you do it, then hang up, turn around and walk away, block her, do whatever you have to do to maintain the peace you want.\n\nYTA only if you don't stand up to your bully.", "**NTA** \\- But how do you tell her?  Sometimes you just have to be blunt to get your point across.  You may come across as an AH to an observer who was unfamiliar with the situation, but that does not make you an AH.
