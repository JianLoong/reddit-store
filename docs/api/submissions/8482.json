I started dyeing my hair since last year and I change the color like every two months. However, I have always showed up in my workplace with a long black wig and it doesn't look fake at all since I'm south asian with natural black hair anyway. \n\nThe issue arose when one of my colleagues whom I have become friendlier with added me on my instagram. He saw pictures of me in my   shorter violet colored hair at a concert. When he saw me the next day in person at work he was a bit confused as I had long black hair again. He made a joke like \"you didn't tell me you had a twin sister. was that her on your instagram story last night?\" I replied no that was me and told him I'm wearing a wig right now and I always have at work. \n\nHe asked me why that was necessary and I just said I don't know I think I like to make a certain appearance at work and keep it separate. He said that's way too much work and started gossiping about it with few other coworkers. They said I am going way overboard to hide my true personality. Some of them started calling me Ms. Uptight whenever they see me. I also dress in a more formal style than others so that contributed to the name as well I guess. \n\nI asked them to stop and they only made it worse and more defensive. I guess I could just stop wearing the wig and show up normally but the thing is I really like the way I dress and look at work. Plus I would be out of there in a few months anyway.

This is a HR violation so report it. They are harassing you based on your appearance and making derogatory comments about it. Calling you names in the workplace is NEVER ok, no matter if they are curse words or just Ms. Uptight. If HR doesn't take it seriously, go above them. This is not OK and honestly, this is why I don't recommend adding people to your socials from work.", "NTA. Report their harassment to HR or supervisors.", "NTA - okay darling, you're awesome and it's a great work around to corporate culture to wear a wig. Promotions, blink impressions and such. You have the right to present yourself any way you want. They're AH.", "You are being bullied. This is workplace bullying. Take a week or two to record incidents and collect evidence and then hit up company HR.", "NTA. They are creating a hostile work environment for you and you should report it. And remember - retaliation is also reportable! You don\u2019t owe them anything outside of your work self. And it\u2019s interesting that with everything going on in the world, THIS is something they choose to focus on.", "NTA. You are dressing professionally and appropriately for work. How you present yourself at work is different than out with friends, or home alone, or with family. That is totally normal and healthy. Your coworker is the asshole for judging you, sharing your information, and getting others involved in bullying you with name calling. You need to block this person from your personal accounts, and be careful who you share with at your next job because you will be leaving soon. Keep doing you \ud83d\udc4d", "Go to HR. NTA. They are jealous because you have a more professional and put together look than they do.", "They are definitely harassing you and being all in your business. How you live your life away from work shouldn\u2019t bug them and during work either.", "I am a woman with a shaved head and I have many wigs. There are absolutely circumstances where I'll wear a certain wig with a certain outfit to convey a message or boundary. There's a Jewish tiktoker who uses a \"natural\" looking wig as her head covering. You're not alone and definitely NTA", "NTA at all. I remember seeing a video a few months ago from a black women speaking about how she feels the need to go above and beyond her white coworkers to appear professional looking at work to get the same level of professional respect that they do. It reminded me of this because the moment they found out you weren\u2019t as \u201cprofessional\u201d as they thought your coworkers started disrespecting you despite it being a choice you made that has no bearing on their lives whatsoever. Like others said I would go to HR, especially if you\u2019re leaving soon at least HR can get them to shut up until you go.", "NTA. Just very strange.", "Your appearance is not your personality. In any case, what you do with your hair is none of their business. Sounds like workplace bullying to me", "\"I'm Asian and I have cool hair. I think way too much about it. AITA?\"", "Run, do not walk, to HR. This is straight-out harassment, no different than if he was commenting on your short skirt or low-cut top. Commenting on others' appearance at work is a definite no-go.\n\nYou are being harassed, borderline sexually. NTA.", "NTA. That\u2019s bullying and never ok.", "If I showed up in my \u201ctrue personality\u201d at work I\u2019d get fired or sent home. Yoga pants (or no pants), tank tops no bra and unbrushed hair are not exactly the professional image most employers want to see. lol", "Calling a woman Miss Uptight is literally a sexist thing to do, the fact that they're implying her wig that looks like natural hair is a problem just sprinkles a dash of racism in the mix.", "Finding and preemptively blocking coworkers on social (except LinkedIn, and I don\u2019t post anything personal there - I barely post at all) is one of the first things I do when starting a new job. I\u2019m connected to *former* coworkers that I was friendly with, but that only happens once we no longer work together. If asked, I say point blank that I don\u2019t connect with coworkers on social media except for LinkedIn, so they can find me there if they like. Not sorry.", "Yeah, I always get downvoted when I link this too. I've stopped trying to argue with people who fling the phrase hostile workplace around. I don't know if they just don't like being wrong or are in total denial about how the world works, but people just don't want to understand this.", "My kids are lucky - we are a charter school district - the whole city - so educators can experiment and are not just stuck with a curriculum. My kids learned the truth behind the Trail of Tears in third grade and all about the civil rights movement and are learning the truth about slavery.", "You explained it better then I. Thank you!"]}
