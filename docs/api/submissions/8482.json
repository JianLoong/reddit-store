I started dyeing my hair since last year and I change the color like every two months. However, I have always showed up in my workplace with a long black wig and it doesn't look fake at all since I'm south asian with natural black hair anyway. \n\nThe issue arose when one of my colleagues whom I have become friendlier with added me on my instagram. He saw pictures of me in my   shorter violet colored hair at a concert. When he saw me the next day in person at work he was a bit confused as I had long black hair again. He made a joke like \"you didn't tell me you had a twin sister. was that her on your instagram story last night?\" I replied no that was me and told him I'm wearing a wig right now and I always have at work. \n\nHe asked me why that was necessary and I just said I don't know I think I like to make a certain appearance at work and keep it separate. He said that's way too much work and started gossiping about it with few other coworkers. They said I am going way overboard to hide my true personality. Some of them started calling me Ms. Uptight whenever they see me. I also dress in a more formal style than others so that contributed to the name as well I guess. \n\nI asked them to stop and they only made it worse and more defensive. I guess I could just stop wearing the wig and show up normally but the thing is I really like the way I dress and look at work. Plus I would be out of there in a few months anyway.
