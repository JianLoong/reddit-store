I won\u2019t go into the details but it was pretty distasteful. I shrugged it off but they just kept coming. The most low-effort and overused stuff I\u2019ve heard time and time again was being said and laughed at and I kept getting increasingly uncomfortable. Eventually I just left mid-routine and went home. \n\nHe texted me that night asking why I had to go in the middle of it and I told him I was uncomfortable with the jokes he was making and that I wouldn\u2019t have gone if I had known that\u2019s what he was going to do. He told me he thought I was being too sensitive and that he doesn\u2019t actually believe what he said, it was just a part of the skit. I told him joke or not it wasn\u2019t funny to me to hear that from someone I thought was my friend. He told me I need to grow up and that he won\u2019t be inviting me along anymore. I didn\u2019t care anymore and just left him on read.\n\nI\u2019m pretty sure I\u2019m not in the wrong here but wanted to hear other people\u2019s perspectives.

Well, never mind, he'll make a black friend or maybe a Jewish one. Or befriend a woman?", "NTA you are not sensitive for being uncomfortable with homophobic jokes from a straight cis man.", "So he is upset that you left early, and your the one who is overly sensitive? What a snowflake!\n\nNTA", "So you are so sensitive, that he threw a fit and bitched and moaned about you not liking his jokes? Sounds like he is the sensitive one and maybe should reconsider his career in comedy. NTA", "NTA. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t actually believe what he said\u201d is the big clue. He knows what he said was offensive. Pretending he didn\u2019t really mean it doesn\u2019t make it ok.", "NTA - Totally NTA \n\nYour friend appears unsympathetic. Unconscious bias is when you shrug off hate speech as nothing. It's not up to a straight person to decide that it's okay to tell gay jokes and not expect queer people to be offended by it. \"Just part of the skit\" does tell a lot about who he is. He's discarding your comment, ignoring that it's hurtful. This level of unintentional bullying was something I experienced way too much in school as well. \n\nI'm glad you're not going to be friends with him anymore. If he's not going to care about how you feel, that's not the kind of friend you want to have.", "NTA he knew. He was testing to see how much you'll tolerate.", "You're good. He's an asshole. Good you didn't waste more than a year on this clown.\n\nDo you suppose there will ever be a day when such things are in the past? Will we ever be free of haters?", "NTA\n\nYou also spelled \"former friend\" wrong.", "NTA - I took a course in standup from a guy who is a career professional in that biz. Most of us in the class had no intention to be on stage, but took it to be more comfortable in work meetings, giving presentations, and such.\n\nOne of the first rules he gave us was to never ridicule a group that you are not a part of. Be it an ethnicity, body type, nationality, sexual orientation, anything that's not your own or is something with which you do not identify.\n\nYeah, people do it for the cheap laugh.", "In this day and age, EVERYONE should have stood up and walked out.", "You're also under no obligation to stick around and listen to jokes, abuse or not.", "Those jokes show exactly what he actually thinks. I would not make homophobic jokes because I am not homophobic. Yeah, jokes are exaggerations, but it is clear he does think Those things", "Literally no one in this scenario is 95, and it's 2023, so what is your point?", "I don\u2019t think \u201cmodern observational\u201d and \u201cbigoted\u201d are really comparable. But whatever. OP is asking if he was an AH for leaving, not if his friend was the AH for making the jokes.", "Oh, I agree. But some people will swear up and down their friends aren't homophobic despite the obvious evidence, as shown here... so I wanted to make sure the point that *it matters anyway* got across.", "His point is that humour is subjective and that expecting everyone to laugh is highly unlikely. However in regards to OPs post it's actually a big issue I have with stand-up, there's way too much low brow shock humour(humour used loosely).", "I posted up above I think the OP is N T A. I was referring to the post above me which said that a joke is bad if not everyone laughs.", "the amount of downvotes is alarming... ig human rights isnt popular anymore", "Netflix explicitly DIDN'T censor Chapelle though."]}
