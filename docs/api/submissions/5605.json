Yesterday we had a small gathering of just myself, my husband, my sister and her husband, with our newborn at our house, whilst we had Christmas dinner together, opened presents, played board games. During a board game my husband passed me our son who was fussing saying he couldn't manage to settle him and for me to see if I could manage. I took our son and began bouncing him on my knee and kissing his face repeatedly saying \"ooh I got a secret kiss snuck in! And another one! And another one!\", just silly affectionate stuff really to distract our son who was fussing after being fed and burped and clean nappy so to me just needed some attention and distraction and cuddles. He calmed down and watched me whilst I was doing it so I knew what I was doing was working. My sister however seemed to find it incredibly embarrassing as she said \"you're in public, stop it\" several times to me quietly, then sat forward and shielded her face from viewed myself and my son with her hand and gave an impatient sigh until I stopped several minutes later. During this I just didn't react at all to what she was saying because in my head I was sure I was right to carry on comforting my son and showing him affection, but since then I've been worrying that I could or should have done something better or differently because she was obviously embarrassed and a guest in my house, and I just didn't react at all because I didn't know if I could or should do differently as my son was my main focus.
