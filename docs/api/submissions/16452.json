The list goes on to where she accuses me of flirting with \u201cher man.\u201d The thing is a ridiculous wall of text, and I\u2019m showing this to my boyfriend before we go to sleep.

They can just sound saint-like without actually having to deal with the consequences.\n\nSo you don't tell Eric... Do your coworkers suppose that the psychotic ramblings can be ignored and the girlfriend won't escalate or harass you any further? Or perhaps they just expect you to start being a dick to Eric as requested and don't tell him why?\n\nNot to mention the base level disrespect of not letting Eric have a say in his own life.", "Very very very very very very very mild YTA on going to Eric before answering Amanda that her \"requests\" are batshit crazy and that she needs to check herself while she's in YOUR living space.   \n\n\nOther than that, NTA. Sounds like overall you did Eric a favor.", "NTA. Your roommate gets to know when his GF is sending unhinged messages.", "NTA the new girlfriend is showing some huge red flags and this is and should be considered a safety concern for all of you.\n\nPeople who behave like this are more likely to be violent because they overreact to normal behaviors between their SO and the people they have built relationships with.\n\nThis type of behavior will lead to more and more control and isolation in the relationship.", "FA&FO?

I probably would have picked your path)", "NTA- at all. \n\nSomeone verbally harassed you, you didn't alter or exaggerate anything when  sharing text screenshots HIS partner sent, and your coworkers think that was petty? wtf.\n\nYou literally sent receipts and nothing else.

NTA I guess, but it could've been handled with more care if you wanted to have less dramatic results.", "NTA. \n\nA wall of text telling you to basically not interact with someone you live with is unreasonable.

Overly possessive is not healthy and something she needs to work with on herself or if her BF is doing stuff (unrelated to whatever she texted you) then that\u2019s between them.

I'm not sure what's with this hot new trend of making people's character flaws the problem of other people.

Your bf's bud needed to know about that at six months instead of six years. I'm shocked people said you bullied her...

Pfft you bullied HER? She tried to dictate how you should act in your own home.\n\n100% agree with this!\n\nThe fact that the girlfriend was trying to make the OP log out of Disney+ account *on her own TV, in her own home* is all kinds of controlling.

Like, this is something a teenager would do, not someone in their 30s. Text walls are generally never appropriate, but this is unhinged.", "Yeah, the ages got me too. Amanda sounds like a teenager with the \"her man\" comments over Disney+.   NTA OP. You probably saved your friend from some psycho bs later down the road. It's weird that your co-workers think you were wrong for this.", "Speaking for all gal-dom, OP needs to know it isn't OK for some woman to demand she stop doing normal things in her own home and if Eric wants to stay w/ the GF after this, he needs to keep her away from his roommates.\n\nEither way, Eric needs to know what his GF is doing  and take some action.\n\nI have no idea what is going on in the minds of people like Eric's GF, but no one should be expected to put up w/ it.", "A girl whose bf was texting like that would also deserve to know.

She's the ah here", "NTA Seriously... your disney account is an issue.", "There was no same conversation to be has there.", "It was made into \"her business\" when this crazy lady berated her for....being a pleasant roommate.  For being logged into a streaming service in her own home.", "See minding your own business works if it wasnt something she was made a part of. \n\nThe crazy gf, quite literally, gave her orders and harrassed her with a large complaint through text. Hence making it her business. \n\nThe gf should've spoken to her bf about it, not hate msg his longtime roommate and friend. \n\nAlso its none of the gfs business whos disney+ account they use. Or frankly who cooks at their own home.", "Bad take", "But Amanda accused OP of trying to steal her boyfriend. Isn\u2019t that OP and Eric\u2019s business as well?", "Lol, are you the gf?

Nothing wrong here.", "Don't start nothing, won't be nothing.", "Lmao. Nah you\u2019re wrong", "OP has her own BF in the house that I am pretty sure would have those concerns before a recent gf of only 6 months. Wanting to use a different streaming login just so Amanda can feel good about herself, when there is already an active account that the people who actually pay rent there use, is next level ridiculous. OP's BF agreed their friend should know that a NOVEL happened over something dumb. During Star Wars. Like really if Amanda wrote all that stuff during Star Wars time, she's clearly the monster.", "Lol, if she can't handle her alcohol to the point where she drunk texts that's on the person to be more cautious on their drinking habits.\n\nAlso the bsf of the bf is the one who wanted him to know. Plus whats wrong with showing the truth of what she msged, if it wasn't anything bad, then it shouldnt matter who sees. Clearly the bf had an issue, which means OPs bf was correct to have OP show him.\nAn frankly what better way to show the gfs concerns than through the msgs she sent to OP\n\nThe gf shouldve spoken to her own bf about her concerns. Rather than send a long list of demands, that was so ridiculous that the disney+ account had to be changed \ud83d\ude02", "Um\u2026 no.

If she Had Feelings for the other she wouldnt do this.\nIm not supporting insanity. Would have done the same. Maybe think before you write crap or feel the consequenses?!", "Nah this level of insecurity is a walking red flag. Not saying the boyfriend shouldn't try to talk to her but she honestly doesn't sound like she's ready for a relationship. Her boyfriend is allowed to be friends with his best friend's girlfriend. She sounds like the type that won't let her man have friendships with other women.", "Amanda, is that you?", "what?", "Absolutely not the girlfriend started this by sending unhinged texts for Absolutely ridiculous reasons. I'd want to know if my partner did that so I could leave the ridiculous. Nta", "Did you miss the part where she has a boyfriend that lives with them?

Are you okay?", "Found the GF", "Did you miss the part where OP has a boyfriend also?", "New fear: unlocked.", ">because the account owner can see where people have logged in from.\n\nI can confirm this with Netflix - I get an email saying that there was a new login on my account by XYZ in ABC place.\n\nHowever, I can't see this information on my DisneyPlus account, so I think that the GF is so controlling that she wants to know what her BF is watching.", "I\u2019m not going to be ignored!", "not the \"bunny bolier\" path!!  \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "I think it's weird AF to share streaming services anyways. I get to watch whatever I want by rotating out streaming services. I have Hulu all the time and then one extra, right now it's Peacock.

Don't want to insult your gf. Sorry, roommie, I can't pick up a gallon of milk for you. Your gf might think I was flirting. Dude needs to run fast from that chick.
