She currently has two older children to where her current youngest is 10 years old. I too have my own child who is a male and is 7. My sister and I were never close due to some family issues when I was younger. I was kind of a brat when I was a kid and I was NOT nice to her, whereas she was the opposite and was sweet and kind and caring.\n\nWhen I was 11 I had trauma done to me by my biological father till I was 13 and told my mother (all of this is important in a moment). My sister then started to hate me and called me a liar and that I wasn't telling the truth to get out of being trouble with them. After that, my sister couldn't stand me. She always chose my father even before then and was extremely close to that side of the family. She would never listen to me after that.\n\nNeedless to say, all of those events changed me and I'm not the person I was when I was a kid. I have since tried to mend my relationship with my sister. I have tried to buy presents for her kids and tried to be a great aunt to them whereas she has never bought my son a birthday present, wished him happy birthday, or even a Christmas present. I have taken her kids to school when she needed the help, and never even asked for gas money. I have picked her kids up early from school when I picked up my own child from school (They go to the same school). I have tried hard by babysitting and just being really kind to her since I went through those traumatic experiences. I wanted a relationship with my sister.\n\nMy husband (27M) is in the military. He has orders to go to South Korea and I'm going with him. We're leaving in February when she is due. I told her a few months ago that I would probably not be around when she has the baby and I haven't heard anything since about the baby. I have been kind of busy with work, my child, and my spouse (we're newlyweds) that I haven't really had time to reach out to her. My mother mentioned that she was having her baby shower in two weeks and asked if I got my invitation. I got really quiet and told her that no, I hadn't received it. It bugged me as all of my family members, even my single uncle, got an invitation and I did not. I chose to call my sister today and ask her why I didn't get an invitation.\n\nTo say she exploded at me was an understatement. She said that I pulled her away from her kids trick or treating to accuse her of stuff and that she didn't \"have time to deal with you (Me)\". I told her I didn't accuse her of anything and I was just curious why I didn't get an invitation and that I had really tried hard to mend my relationship with her. She laughed harshly and told me that I hadn't done anything and that I'm crazy. She then hung up the phone.\n\nSo...

You asked because your mother indicated you should have received an invitation.  Clearly, sis did something to intercept it.  It's her baby shower and she's entitled to determine the guest list.

Looking at this from your sister's perspective, I can see how you treated her when your were kids made her distrustful of you. I don't know the entire context of how you weren't nice, or how you \"acted like a brat\" toward her, but she seems to think you're willing to go out of your way to hurt her. Now I'm not saying this to say that you don't have trauma of your own, just that your sister does on her end as well. That's where the communication comes in. I don't think your sister truly understands what happened to you. Especially if she's getting inaccurate info from the father.", "NTA.  If everyone else, including single Uncle, is invited, it is natural to wonder where your invite is.\n\nThis sister who \"was sweet and kind and caring\" has changed also and not for the better.  Can your mom explain anything?  It seems your sister has spent years showing you who she is now, and that is not a sweet and kind and caring person.  Go South Korea and have a fantastic time; leave your worries in the US.", "Look on the bright side, at least you don\u2019t have to buy any gifts considering she never gave your child any either. NTA", "My husband said pretty much the same... It just hurts because family is really important to me. I guess I know where I stand now.", "I can add some clarification. She said I was accusing her of purposefully keeping me off the list when I asked why I didn't get an invitation because she said she spoke to me about it months ago. What she was referring to was me not being there for the birth of the baby. I never once said I wouldn't be there for the shower, and I would like to go and be with her.\n\nThere is also the fact she's still in contact with our birth father and is very close to him and I am... not. He and I have not had a relationship for years. And he always talks crap about me to her and tries to... turn her against me? That's what my mom says. I wouldn't know as I don't talk to him or my sister about him (sensitive topic). \n\nAnything else you would like to ask, I can add more clarification to... But this is all honest. It was literally a 2 minute phone call.", "It does feel that some significant information is missing here.", "I understand what you're saying. I have apologized for what I did to her. I was more of just mean verbally and took toys and stuff. This was all under the age of 10. I can understand why she feels that way but I have tried to make it up to her and I tried to show her how sorry I am. Thank you for your opinion.", "My mom has played mediator to us for years... and it's beginning to wear on her. The best she can give me is that my sister thinks of me as selfish, bitchy, and uncaring. Which I used to be as a kid, and I am not now. Most of my family have said I'm not who I used to be. \n\nI plan on going to South Korea and literally blocking her out of my life.", "You have been trying to hard to please her\u2026she has used you in a manner to her advantage. You should really stop trying so hard. She keeps treating you badly and you are not getting the message.", "Wouldn't it be surprising if your dad had done stuff to you, but not her?  Her not dealing with all that trauma could explain her behavior.", "You say you've been trying to have a relationship with your sister. Do you think you've been succeeding in general? \n\nAfter your change of heart, would you say your relationship with your sister has improved? Or is she just tolerating you?", "I agree.  I am leaning y-t-a and really feeling line this is a seriously spun side of this story with tons of missing context.", "I get that for sure, but she was older and probably remembers it differently, or maybe it impacted her more than you realize, who knows? If I were in your position, I'd make one last effort and write her a letter explaining how you feel and asking her what it would take for the two of you to have a better relationship and ask her how she's been feeling about how you've been reaching out/trying to be there for her. If she blows you off, or reacts badly, then you do have your answer. And I'm only suggesting a letter because of how you said how much family means to you. But, if you have a pretty clear idea already and don't want to write a letter like that, just reach out one last time explaining that you've tried your best to mend the relationship, but you're not willing to put up with her outbursts anymore and that you'll still be pleasant (for the sake of your mother), but she shouldn't expect to rely on you anymore. That being said, I wish you the best and I hope everything will work out.", "I think going NC with her is the right decision.", "She did mention to me once when I was seventeen that he had done some of the stuff to her, but she wouldn't go into detail nor would talk about it after that. I do think she hasn't dealt with it, but she won't talk about it and I can't force her.", "Tolerate probably, though I will say I think she harbors resentment about me coming out about the stuff done to me by my dad. And I think she can't let go of when I was an absolute bitch to her when we were kids. I mean like... ten and under age.", "That explains a lot.  Usually in these cases the groomer drops the older child when the younger is more alluring.  The two of you might need therapy.", "Well, there ya go I guess. It seems that, by own admission, your sister doesn't really like you even after your efforts. \n\nI hope you do manage to have some kind of relationship with her at some point nontheless. \n\nNTA for asking.", "This information is very helpful with figuring out a judgment. NTA.", "I received therapy and have come to terms with what happened to me. Which is part of the reason I tried so hard to get along with my sister and make up things to her. She never went. We tried to get her to go but she refused."]}
