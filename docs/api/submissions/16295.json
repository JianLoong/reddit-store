{"id": 16295, "submission_id": "136qf04", "title": "WIBTA to insist my neighbor keep a yard schedule?", "selftext": "For background I have a severely reactive rescue dog. She's terrified of other dogs and freaks out majorly when she sees them or hears them. My partner and I have been working with our vet and a behavioral trainer and we've made some progress, but my dog is still not truly comfortable anywhere but her own yard.\n\nA new lady just moved in next door, and she has two big dogs. They seem like nice dogs, they are quiet and she works with them a lot. The problem is that she works from home full time, and her dogs are always outside. She doesn't leave them there for hours or anything, but I never know when she's going to let them out or for how long. She also spends a lot of time out there with them after work and on weekends. I can hear her training and playing fetch or she'll have them out with her while she's doing yard work.\n\nTo be fair to her, she trains them and she doesn't let them run up on the fence, and if they do bark, she makes them go inside. They're still out on the other side of the fence though and my dog is now scared and reacting in her own backyard. When my dog starts carrying on, she is the one who has to go inside. She already can't enjoy walks and now she can't even enjoy being outside.\n\nI asked my neighbor if she'd consider a schedule for the dogs so that my dog can enjoy her yard too without the neighbor's dogs freaking her out on the other side of the fence. She was polite about it but said no, she bought the house with the yard for her dogs, and they use it. She said she'd be glad to tell me when she's leaving with them for a period of hours, but otherwise she's not going to change what she's doing day to day. So nothing changed and her dogs get plenty of outdoor time and mine gets none except for the stray times when she takes one of her dogs to a training class or takes both of them for a hike. I'm really upset and want to insist that we adopt a schedule so that my dog can have some outside time too.\n\nWIBTA if I insisted she work with me to adopt a schedule that's fair to all the dogs?\n\nEdit so to clarify: My dog does not get the same opportunity as her dogs, not even close. Her dogs have free access five days a week, weeknights, and weekends. My dog only gets outside time now when she says she is leaving for a class or a hike. If I let my dog out to sun herself at 10:30 on a Tuesday, sure enough, it won't be five minutes before she's letting her dogs out and then my dog freaks out and has to come in. She is not getting anywhere close to what they are getting.\n\nEdit again the fence is a privacy fence. My dog freaks out when she can hear and smell the other dogs as well as see them. She can't see these dogs but she knows they're there.", "created_utc": 1683127413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136qf04/wibta_to_insist_my_neighbor_keep_a_yard_schedule/", "score": 3843, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So your framing of \"insisting\" on a yard schedule is a full AH move. \n\nAnd she doesn't need to be consistent. Her dogs are well trained, she clearly watches them and takes them in when they bark, and seems overall lovely. You could say something like- I have a very reactive dog, would it be okay if I text you when she is out, ONCE a day, and ask that you keep your dogs in for 30 minutes or so, so that she can be outside? If I was your neighbor, I'd be okay with that, with the understanding that it won't always work (doesn't see the text message, dogs have to use go to the bathroom, she has plans already, etc). But if I had dogs and I got a text a couple days of week about the other dog being out, I'd be fine accommodating that. \n\nBut only on a temporary basis, so that leads to...are you training and trying to help your reactive dog? You say your poor dog doesn't get to be outside, but that is on you to solve, with training, therapy, etc. Your dog should be able to exist outside with other animals, especially the ones you described. Your dog does need physical exercise, and just being outside in a yard isn't enough. You need to be actively solving this problem for your dog, because that is what is best for your dog.

If he was ever over threshold I would create more distance between him and his trigger. He\u2019s now 2 years strong without a reaction. I feel for you, a reactive dog is hard and exhausting but it is 100% your responsibility to help your dog navigate the world as it exists. It is not the world\u2019s responsibility to cater to you.

She's terrified of other dogs and freaks out majorly when she sees them or hears them. My partner and I have been working with our vet and a behavioral trainer and we've made some progress, but my dog is still not truly comfortable anywhere but her own yard.\n\nA new lady just moved in next door, and she has two big dogs. They seem like nice dogs, they are quiet and she works with them a lot. The problem is that she works from home full time, and her dogs are always outside. She doesn't leave them there for hours or anything, but I never know when she's going to let them out or for how long. She also spends a lot of time out there with them after work and on weekends. I can hear her training and playing fetch or she'll have them out with her while she's doing yard work.\n\nTo be fair to her, she trains them and she doesn't let them run up on the fence, and if they do bark, she makes them go inside. They're still out on the other side of the fence though and my dog is now scared and reacting in her own backyard. When my dog starts carrying on, she is the one who has to go inside. She already can't enjoy walks and now she can't even enjoy being outside.\n\nI asked my neighbor if she'd consider a schedule for the dogs so that my dog can enjoy her yard too without the neighbor's dogs freaking her out on the other side of the fence. She was polite about it but said no, she bought the house with the yard for her dogs, and they use it. She said she'd be glad to tell me when she's leaving with them for a period of hours, but otherwise she's not going to change what she's doing day to day. So nothing changed and her dogs get plenty of outdoor time and mine gets none except for the stray times when she takes one of her dogs to a training class or takes both of them for a hike. I'm really upset and want to insist that we adopt a schedule so that my dog can have some outside time too.\n\nWIBTA if I insisted she work with me to adopt a schedule that's fair to all the dogs?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have a skittish golden retriever puppy who is scared of everything and everyone the first time she sees it/them and sometimes she just decides she is still going to be scared later. Like with suitcases. We\u2019re lucky enough to have a big field behind our house where dogs can go play off leash, and the first time she saw me open the gate to out there, she was not cool with it. But she trusted me enough to let me bring her out to take a look, and once she saw her brothers playing like it was nothing at all (because they go out there all the time), she was perfectly happy to run around and have fun because she trusted me and I am safe for her. Because she trusts me and I am safe for her and she trusts the rest of our family and we are safe for her, we have made a big deal out of teaching her the \u201cwatch me\u201d command so that when she\u2019s skittish or frightened we can have her look at us and see that we are calm and in control of the situation and everything is okay. That\u2019s what your dog needs, for you to be calm and in control and not agitated, because if you are agitated, so is she. She\u2019s already reactive, so instead of you being reactive too, try being calm and making her look at you so that she can settle.

Let me offer some practical advice from personal experience: I've fostered reactive dogs and we have a privacy fence and our neighbors all have dogs. The fence-barking was insane. You say they can't see each other but they can. So we bought some tarps, trimmed them to the full size of the fence, and attached them solidly along the fence, covering all the cracks between the boards. It made a HUGE difference. There are even fence barrier products you can buy (it is essentially a trap, just precut and probably better quality). Sure, they can still hear the dog and know it's there but the \"threat\" is diminished, and the barking/fence running all but disappeared. Another thing you can do is an interior fence. Just a few feet from the privacy fence in your yard, erect another kind of fence. Cheap wire or whatever. Keep the dog from being able to get up so close. You can even do pretty landscaping between the two fences if you want it to look nice. I sympathize with you because I've been through it and it is hard but also as a dog owner who specifically chose a fenced yard for my dogs I'd think your request was absurd and there isn't a chance I'd agree to it. Sorry.", "Insisting on a schedule is not fair or right. BUT, you could ask your neighbor if you could have 6-7am and 8-9pm, or something, that you daily let your dog out and she avoids letting hers out if possible. Pick times that are probably not convenient for her and would be easily avoidable. Offer a half hour instead of an hour if an hour isn\u2019t doable. And accept that if she says yes, it\u2019s her being kind, not because she \u201cshould\u201d or has to or anything, and maybe find out what treats/toys her dogs like and bring some over for her as a thank you - even if she says no.

But your neighbour is not there to give in to your 'wants'\n\nyou asked - she answered - thats the end of it", "But that\u2019s not an option and you have to accept that. Your neighbor is free to use her yard anytime as she pleases as is her right. I understand that it\u2019s set you back with your dog but it\u2019s time to move forward as the schedule is not on the table.", "Part of making progress is sometimes falling back a bit when you hit the next big step. Sorry to say it, but your dog getting \"better\" because they never had to be around other dogs because your yard had no other dogs to encounter around or in it, isn't really getting better because the dog's problem isn't being alone, it's being around other dogs. You aren't entitled to her makingor following a schedule. If anything it's on you to make a schedule for *yourself and your dog* and stick to it, regardless of if her dogs are outside, so that way your dog can ACTUALLY work on the problem instead of being allowed to run away from it. Your dog is going to bark? Buy the neighbors some ear plugs and warn them you're going to start exposure training your dog and they may be barking and you apologize in advance, like parents in apartment buildings sleep training their children. If your dog is going to get aggressive, get it a muzzle because muzzles are tools for safety and training not torture devices or an inherent sign of a \"bad\" dog. Your dog is never going to learn other dogs aren't all dangerous if you never show him that or allow him to be exposed to it long enough for him to understand that.", "I feel for your situation but you sound exhausting.  Also, although no you shouldn't immediately give up on a dog if it has issues, it's also ok to admit you are not the right person for this dog and it may be more suited to another handler.\n\nIf the entire world has to accommodate your dogs needs, then perhaps it's not the right fit for you.", "I feel for you and your dog, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re understanding what other people are saying. You\u2019re neighbor bought a house and piece of land and has every right to use that piece of land for their dogs. As a neighbor who loves dogs and who has a somewhat reactive dog, if you came to me with this proposition, I think even I wouldn\u2019t be able to say yes. It\u2019s tough to work around my own work schedule and life with my dog let alone a neighbors as well. \n\nI know you say there\u2019s no other options, but it is up to YOU to figure something out. Not your neighbor. Try more training. Work more on positive associations, ex. Open bar close bar, or more desensitizing. Maybe sound proof your fencing some. Maybe try that app that rents private space for your dog to give your pup a safe space to release energy. And ultimately, if you have exhausted all options and can\u2019t make something work, consider if your pups quality of life would be better in a different home that has no close by neighbors.\n\nAgain, I understand the struggle, but YWBTA if you continue to push this with your neighbor after they told you no and are already telling you when they leave for long periods of time.", "I did this with an old neighbor that had big aggressive dogs. Just added some extra fencing so my dogs couldn\u2019t get right up to the fence. Worked great", "Thank you for saying this. I really didn't know it was okay to do this. I thought it would be the worst thing I could do and we'd be failing her.", "Your neighbor is amazing (edit: compared to mine). My neighbor has 4 dogs who are outside unless it is freezing or raining, which in South Texas means almost 24/7. And they are not well behaved, nor quiet. They bark 75% of the time, at deer, at squirrels, at people walking by the front of the house, and worst at me in my own backyard. I literally can't go in my own backyard without 4 dogs barking so loud you think there was an intruder in their yard. People houses away have commented on their barking. I sleep with noise canceling headphones in order to not be awoken multiple times a night. My dog, thankfully, isn't reactive, but she will get annoyed by the dogs as well, and so she spends quite a bit of time indoors. Your dog is your problem to solve, find ways to encourage her to feel safe in her backyard. Don't ask someone else to do something you don't even want to do. (This is like a parent saying to another parent, \"Don't let your kids be outside so much, because their fun/life annoys/scares/etc my kids\") YTA", "YTA. Maybe try finding a safe, remote area in your area that you can take your dog, like a spacious park or a rarely used hiking trail or pond. Or adopt an earlier schedule so that she can go out before your neighbor wakes up to take her dogs out. Your dog is your responsibility and you cannot expect people to accommodate her needs.", "So, yes, YWBTA.\n\nBut I think you might need to take a step back and a breather here. You are, understandably, upset and frustrated. Those feelings are being unfairly hoisted onto your neighbor, who has not done anything wrong. Your neighbor has every right to use their yard whenever and however they want. To frame it a different way: imagine you had a severe phobia of tomatoes (stay with me here). Say that your neighbor had a big raised bed garden that contains, among other things, a big patch of tomatoes. Say that they liked to garden every morning, which happens to be when you like having coffee in your backyard. Having them prune and pick tomatoes so close to you really sets off your phobia.  \n\n\nCould you ask them to garden at a different time of day, and would that make your life easier? Sure, it doesn't hurt to ask. If they said no, would you try to insist that they change their schedule anyway? No - that would be ridiculous, because ultimately it is your issue, not theirs, and your problem to work around. You can't police the behavior of others, only change your own behavior.  \n\n\nNow, it sounds like you've about exhausted your options to change your own behavior (or really, your dog's behavior) through medication and training. I totally understand how heartbreaking and frustrating it is to not see any forward progress with a difficult behavioral case. The calculus you'll then have to make is this: What is your dog's quality of life? If it is poor, are you (you, not your neighbor) able to provide reasonable accommodations to improve her quality of life? If the answer is no, it may be time to consider behavioral euthanasia. This is, difficult as it is, sometimes the kindest option if QOL is poor and all other avenues have been exhausted - seeking a second opinion from a different trainer and/or different behavioral vet is not a bad idea if you have not done so already. \n\nIf you make that choice, it doesn't make you a bad dog owner. Crucially, it is not the fault (at all) of your neighbor or her dogs. If the fact is that your dog can only have a good quality of life never seeing another dog, it is understandable that you are not able to provide that for her.", "YTA. Sorry, but this is a you problem. It sounds like you have a great respectful neighbor.", "YTA and entitled to boot. YOU have a reactive dog. Your neighbor has behaved dogs and her own private property that she and her dogs have the right to enjoy. If YOU can't properly managed your dog you need to rehome it or deal with the life of having a reactive dog without making it anyone else's problem. YOU do not get to impose this upon your neighbor.", "YWBTA. Your neighbor is doing everything right, it\u2019s you and your dog that are the issue. Why should she have to walk on eggshells in her own yard because you bit off more than you can chew with a super reactive dog?", "Your neighbor provides you with regular, safe, controlled, predictable training opportunities and you\u2019re complaining?\n\nBet she\u2019d even have been willing to help you.", "WTF this can't even be serious. Of COURSE YWBTA. You are trying to force someone to NOT use their backyard? Your neighbor was perfectly polite, and more reasonable than she needed to be. Your dog is your problem. Take your dog to a dog park. or a forest preserve. \n\nIt isn't up to your neighbor to make sure your dog gets as much outside time as her dogs get, thats ridiculous.", "The situation you're in sucks, however you have no leverage to force anyone to follow your arbitrary schedule.\nYta if you try.\nI suggest investing in a privacy fence to maybe help your doggo. Best of luck!", "Wow is this even real? Obviously YTA. You're lucky she lets you use it at all. The entitlement is shocking.", "Instead of complaining that your dog can\u2019t go out, have you considered asking her for some help or tips? She sounds like a great dog mom and might be able to offer you some ideas. Do you leave the dog in the yard alone and it gets scared of the other dogs? Maybe if you were out there, you could help calm the dog. She does not seem unreasonable.", "YWBTA I think she was pretty accommodating with being willing to let you know when she is going to be gone for long periods.

It was ballsy, but fair enough of you to ask and she even agreed to let you know when the dogs are gone. There\u2019s nothing more to expect from your neighbor. This was, is and will be a you (your dog) problem.\n\nYou can\u2019t expect everyone to adjust to that and YWBTA if you push your neighbor even more.", "Have you tried using white noise so she is less likely to hear the dogs next door?\nA run for her so she will be on the other side of the yard to create more distance between her and the dogs ? \nSome sort of redirection where you use a clicker and the treat her?\nBeing outside w her on leash doing the above ? \n\nShe CAN be helped. It\u2019s just that you either weren\u2019t consistent or didn\u2019t use the methodology she needs to succeed.", "Yes you would be. And may I ask, when your dog starts freaking out is your reaction to just bring them in? Because you need to work more on corrected behaviors rather than punishment. When your dog starts to freak out, you need to step in and correct them. Even if it's refocusing them onto you or something else. I don't know the full parameters of your situation, but you simply cannot impose rules onto someone else and their property. She was polite enough to let you know when she and the dogs would be gone so you can have your time, and she didn't even need to do that. Take what you've got, and work with your dog on your side of the fence. Talk to the behavioral trainer and see what they reccomend you do to correct the behavior at home. Training doesn't mean it ends when the session is over, you and your partner need to put in the same effort at home to make progress.", "Sounds like you need to start training your dog buddy.", "YTA. The world does not revolve around you and your poor dog. I'm surprised she didn't laugh in your face when you made your first request. She's a better person than me.", "Yes YWBTA, you can't dictate when someone else uses their property. I'm sorry your dog is suffering but it isn't your neighbors problem. All you are going to do is anger your neighbor by trying to insist. No one has to do things your way. You need to put your energy elsewhere. I hope you find a solution and I hope you back off your neighbor. You don't want to end up having a feud with your neighbor over something you do not control.", "YTA, not your yard not your business what or when she or the dogs are in it.", "I also have a reactive dog. Except when he sees/smells/hears other dogs his first reaction is to attempt to eat them (he likes cats though). I sometimes joke that I need to implement a neighborhood dog walking schedule...but that's what it is- a joke. While it would be hugely convenient for me, no one owes me or my dog anything. Your neighbor is right, she bought a house with a yard for her dogs and its her business on when they are out there. While I greatly sympathize with you, YWBTA if you ask again.  \n\nI try to walk my dog later in the morning and evenings when most are done with their walks.

However, I\u2019m not sure if this is a crazy suggestion, but could the dogs meet on neutral ground somewhere? Empty dog park? That way there\u2019s no leashes (meeting other dogs while on leashes really triggers my dog to be defensive bc she can\u2019t escape when she\u2019s had enough)\n Could you and the neighbor and your dogs go for a walk all together on a quiet road or nature trail where they\u2019ll be with each other but slightly distracted from each other by smells and sounds? Maybe it would actually help your pup get more comfortable with them being over there on their side of the fence. \n\n\nMy dog is super reactive and has been her whole life but she does enjoy the company of  neutered male dogs. One in particular lives up the road and she has gotten over many fears by doing things with him and observing how he acts. We also taught her recall using this other dog.", "[removed]", "This is a training issue FOR YOU. You need months of solid training with someone who works with reactive dogs. Behaviorists like to medicate. Meds are great but not the answer alone. Get a trainer who can make real differences for your dog. There are podcasts dedicated to this.\n\nYou have options other than your yard. My very favorite trainers use decompression/sniff walks in the woods for dogs like yours along with a training program that uses controlled exposure. \n\nIf you can\u2019t dedicate yourself to do this, maybe your dog needs an owner with a bigger property or the ability to train intensively. It\u2019s not a flaw if you truly can\u2019t a reactive dog. They\u2019re difficult.", "I agree with the above. Maybe OP could ask the neighbour where they get their dogs trained and work with a trainer to help their dog get used to having dogs next door?

We have a dog who has severe fear agression and is literally afraid of EVERYTHING. She (L) is on meds and we worked with a trainer.\n\nWe decided to take in a stray dog. We figured we could see how it would go for a bit and if it looked like it wasn't working, we would take him to a shelter. Well, was NOT going well.  It was the height of Covid and we discovered there were no shelters or rescues that would accept self surrenders. Literally the only choice we would have had would be to turn him back out on the street. We couldn't do that.\n\nHe (A) was highly destructive so we had to limit his access to the house so he couldn't grab something and run, destroying whate we item before we could get it from him.  It was a YEAR of them being kept in seperate bedrooms (directly across the hall from each other) 24/7 and shuffling outside time. They clearly aware that the other was there. My husband and I stopped sleeping in the same bedroom and instead had each of us in with one of the dogs. As I said, we did that for at least a year. \n\nThen we got a very large heavy iron dog gate to put between two rooms. So then L and A were in a room on either side of the gate. That way L couldn't get to A but they could see each other and she could get more used to him. Since A was destructive, he and I would stay in the kitchen and L had run of the house. When my husband was home we, again, would each be on either side of the fence with one dog apiece. That was several months, still shuffling outside time and eating. \n\nWe then started taking them out in the yard together on leashes. Walking around the yard in wide berths keeping them far apart. When that seemed to be going well we started \"parallel\" walks in the yard. Started far apart and slowly bringing them closer together. We finally felt safe letting them together without any barriers.\n\nThe whole thing took at least a year and a half. And for several more months they were never allowed out in the yard together unsupervised. Our goal was to get to the point where they could at least be in the same room together even if on seperate sides.\n\nIt's been several years and they are now good buddies. A has led to being less agressive and reactive. She is sooo much more calm now. But we still have never left them home alone together out of an abundance of caution. \n\nFunny enough, a couple of year ago people moved in next door with two dogs. It freaked her the fuck out at first. Especially because we have a wrought iron fence and the would come right up to it and bark at her. But eventually she got used to it. She'll now run along the fence with them and snuffle through the fence. \n\nWe've had L for around 10 years. When we first go her she had to go through the employee entrance and not the lobby at the vets. To do a nail trim required a muzzle, two vet techs holding her down with the vet also partially holding her down while trimming her nails. Now it usually only takes a single vet tech (that she knows) and the vet, no muzzle. However, if it's more than a trim, the vet still wants a muzzle on her. Since having A (and the dogs next door) she can now walk through the lobby as long as it's not crowded.\n\nFrom where she started to where she is is a complete miracle. But she still has agression, needs a lot of accommodations, and an abundance of caution. 10 years . As our trainer said, she will NEVER be \"normal\".

How often are you training every day? Check out a dog behaviorist. Not just a behavioral trainer, but an actual educated animal behaviorist who specializes in dogs. I had to go to an emergency vet with specialists to find mine, and there was a waiting list. Click [here](https://www.thesprucepets.com/dog-trainers-versus-behaviorists-1118258) to read about the difference. You want someone with a PhD. \n\nObserving her specific triggers can be helpful, and so is knowing what she may be working with in terms of instincts. What breed is she? How old is she? What is her diet and general health? What do you know about her history? Obviously her history should be taken with a grain of salt since you weren't properly aware of her reactivity prior to adoption, but it's still good info to have.\n\nAlso, a tired dog is a happy dog. What are you doing to tucker her out? Do you give her kongs full of frozen pb or puzzle toys? She should NEVER be eating from a bowl at this point. She needs to be as mentally stimulated as possible. Making her work for her food is a really great way to accomplish working on this every day. Clearly, fear and anxiety play a huge role in her life, and exhausting her is massively helpful in decreasing that. While physical activity is important, mental stimulation is massively useful in tiring a dog out. Yes, keep up with walks and play, but training new tricks is SO powerful for building confidence, trust, bonding, and adequate exhaustion. If my dogs are extra pissy, it's ALWAYS because they aren't tired enough. \n\nDo you play hide and seek with her at home? That's a really great game that EXHAUSTS them. It is great for impulse control (waiting while you hide), recall (coming when you call them once from your hiding spot), and nosework (sniffing you out). Celebrate and treat when she finds you. My dogs run all over the house. They actually have to be separated and play one at a time because they get so overstimulated and excited that it can lead to play aggression if I'm not careful!\n\nThere's of information online about mentally stimulating your dog and basic enrichment. Check kikopup on YouTube. She has amazing games that dogs love. She teaches you how to train tricks.

It can be miserable.

Not the neighbors, YOUR DOG. Without you even saying what breed of dog you have, I can guarantee you it's a pit ruining an innocent person livelihood.", "YTA but all that aside it kind of sounds like this dog has 0 quality of life just based on her fears and temperament. I hate to be the only one to suggest euthanasia but if she is literally so terrified of everything she can\u2019t even be in her own backyard without shutting down it might be time to sit down and talk to a vet on what to do. She\u2019s medicated and seeing a trainer, if there hasn\u2019t been any improvement it might be time.", "Fuck YOU", "Exactly. YTA, OP.\n\nMy neighbor and I also have a privacy fence (basic chain link with the mesh fabric woven through it.) We both have multiple large, protective dogs who like to bark and showboat through the fence at each other. We both want to enjoy our backyards with our children. So: we both act like adults, and respect the fact that sometimes, the other person's dogs will be outside. And if I want my kid to nap, or my dogs to not start digging at the fence line, or to ensure that my hound dog isn't baying loud enough to wake the dead, then I'll keep my dogs inside while hers are outside. We both try to glance outside and check through the fence if the other's dogs are outside before we let ours out. And you know what?? Sometimes, I gotta let mine out anyway, cuz I got stuff to do and they need to go out. And vice versa. And my neighbor and I just try to enjoy our own space and realize the world doesn't revolve around us. Does respect help? Yes. Would it be nice if we could work out a schedule so both of our dogs got 50/50 yard time with bothering each other?? Ideally, yes. But that's not life. Sometimes both dogs are outside together. We accommodate. My hound dog is RELENTLESS when he's focused. It's just that singular, hound dog drive. He will not stop trying to get through that fence when my neighbor's biggest dog is outside, so we acclimated. He now has a lead outside. It's got plenty of length, 30+ feet, but it's the perfect length to stop him about 10 feet shy of the fence bordering my neighbor's yard. He's less inclined to mess with them when he knows he'll never get there, and now sometimes he's chill on his lead even when the neighbor's dogs are out. Point is, we made changes and figured it out.

And not because she isn\u2019t trying, but because she\u2019s bouncing around like a pinball. If she can detach, break, and then come back with a step by step plan for how to digest the ideas (lots of which are actually good ones), that might go better.", "Don\u2019t get me wrong, OP has no grounds to ask her neighbor for anything.

But you can't control what your neighbour does.\n\nYou might be able to make some accomodations in your yard. My maltese is a prolific barker particularly when people walk along our side fence. So we've made him a section of yard where he isn't up against the fence - in our case it was easy enough to do because of the shape of the yard/house. We just used some dog fence panel stuff from a local hardware shop. If that doesn't work you will just need to keep on with acclimitasation and desensitistion work. Same maltese had a bad groomer as a puppy (bad bleeding nicks all over his belly when we picked him up) & would not be groomed by anyone - it took nearly 2 years of desensitisation work to get him to the point where we can use clippers on him at all. His problems are nowhere as severe as your poor pups, but I wanted you to know that if you keep on it the problems may/should improve - it takes lots of time and lots of patience.\n\nMake sure your behavioural trainer is a trained and certified dog pyschologist and don't be afraid to get second opinions about approaches to rehabilitating your dog as your dogs needs are quite severe. Some behavioural trainers are great with simple or more common behavioural problems but can struggle with more complex needs. Not saying that is the case here, but I thought I'd point it out just in case.\n\nAussie shepherds are generally great dogs, smart and trainable. Obedience training and beyond helps stimulate their mind and get them thinking and focused and helps to build the bond between you and them. They'll take a lot of their cues from you. For a dog with more complex issues obedience training doesn't hurt but it also doesn't address the underlying issues - that is where the dog behaviourist/pysch comes in to figure out why the dog is reacting a certain way and what to do about it. It can take a lot of time, patience, and committment.  They can advise on ways to acclimatise and desensitise your dog to the presence of your neighbours dogs, for example.  \n\n**Take some time. Talk to your vet and trainer. Seek further advice and help if needed. Come up with a plan.** \n\nI wish you and your dog all the best.", "I was hoping to see the reference to exposure therapy.

I'm glad someone already posted about it high enough in the comments for OP to see it.", "Well, not quite. What's incredibly important is that exposure will actually make things worse if the dog is over threshold and reacting. The exposure to the stimulus needs to happen before the dog is past the threshold.

They may try taking their dog out on a leash to find the point where their dog is no longer taking food or able to focus on them, and start training from before that point. For example if the dog gets to halfway across the yard before it realizes there are other dogs in the other side of the fence and starts reacting, op could take them to just before that line and do the engage disengage exercises or some other reactivity exercises. \n\nAnd yes, it is often really tough and tiring to work with a reactive dog, but we can't make the world change for us.

This is one of the most entitled attitudes I\u2019ve ever seen on here, which is saying a lot.", "Exactly. The neighbor has already been very accommodating. OP\u2019s entitlement is kind of astounding.", "OP def has Main Character syndrome.", "I think you or OP is totally fine to ask, and you/they might be lucky and have a very understanding neighbour that is willing to do something to accommodate them, but there is no obligation for the neighbours and if they don't want to you just have to accept it.", "Exactly this for many animals. I\u2019ve owned horses and dogs my whole life. Horses are reactive. Curiosity and being reactive makes for interesting times.  \nMy horse would freak out at something, I\u2019d just scold them to knock it off and stop being a jackass. Horse calms down and goes about its day. \nWhy? The horse was reacting to the emotions of the person with it. I went about it as if it\u2019s an everyday thing they shouldn\u2019t be scared of, no reaction other than keeping them safe. It\u2019s hard to really explain- the problem isn\u2019t ignored per say,  it\u2019s just made insignificant. So the horse \u201csees\u201d it the same way. \nAnimals feed off the energy of those they are around. And this woman may not realize this. She and the dog were done wrong by the rescue. But the bottom line is she needs to do right by the dog. Get a trainer that can truly help this dog (certified or not since this rescue was obviously desperate to just dump it in someone). The rescue will not be taking it back. There\u2019s too many homeless strays to worry about a homed one unless it is being starved or physically abused. \nOr rehome it to someone that can handle the challenge. \nBottom line: not the neighbors problem.

Babies and toddlers can feel what their parents are feeling and if the parent is anxious you're going to have anxious kids.", "This.\n\nThe very rapid evolution of dogs due to Humans intentional and unintentional selective breeding of them means we've ended up where dogs are absolute experts at reading our body language. It's really cool, and a relationship that's quite unique, but they'll definitely be anxious if they read that their human is anxious.", "I've done exposure therapy and it's hard and a lot of work but it's so worth it. I've seen dogs really thrive under similar training conditions, where you slowly work so they can associate the fear with enough positive experiences that they dog can live a better quality of life.

I rescued dogs with wildly different needs and abilities, fostered them all, and ended up adopting the most traumatized because she worked so hard to be a good family member, and a second one because she gave us zero work. Dog training is not big in my homecountry, so I only taught them the basics but they were very intelligent and learned a lot by observing us. The traumatized one took two years to leave the apartment (and some body strength to almost force her the first time, despite she seeing the other dog going out and coming back twice daily), but she quickly started enjoying being walked. The second dog even watched my baby years later, when I needed to step away for a few minutes.", "If anything about half of them decide that life improved because they get a new treat every day.

Sadly, this reactive dog didn\u2019t have a good life, and his owner that rescued him could not handle him.", "I didn't want to write a novel on how to approach it but obviously you don't expose the dog for the whole time.

My cats love to go outside to their yard to sun themselves.  They wear latex claw tips to prevent them from hunting birds, they are microchipped, licensed, registered, up to date on all shots, wear a collar and /or harness with a name tag & several bells.  They do not leave their yard!  How is that possible you may say?  Simply put, they're trained. They go out wearing a harness and leash.  They are shown and learn where the boundaries are. Trees have bird netting so they can't get to the birds.  But I also use the trees to create safe high places, bolt holes, sun catchers etc., lastly, they are only out when I'm out!  They come when they're called, by their names!  \nUnfortunately I can't control other cats, but I've discovered ways to keep them apart.  Such as planting beds of catnip with chicken wire laid in the soil to prevent the cats from defecating in them and my flower beds.  \nI'm more concerned about Eagles & Hawks killing the birds than my babies doing so.  I've got a great video of a Hawk taking out a Magpie in my backyard.", "My sister and her husband bought two pedigree cats from a reputable breeder due to allergies.    \n\nThey had never been outside. They wanted to have inside cats only. It was impossible for the male cat. He kept trying to sneak outside and vocally let it be known he wanted outside.  \n\nHe was actively unhappy no matter what they did. So he\u2019s outside in the sunshine with his harness and leash. So he\u2019s safe, happy and wildlife is safe. They considered building a cattery, but he only wants outside in good weather. Since we live in the Netherlands, that\u2019s only a few months a year.   \n\nSince I met him, I do think some cats need the outside to thrive. But they have harnesses, leashes and safe outdoor spaces for that.

Cat patios are a very good alternative for kitties that wanna go outside.", "In Germany it's just normal to have cats outside. And no law against it. However here I have seen studies that bird numbers in residential areas have actually gone up over the last 50 years, but bird types nesting in farming areas/fields are in serious danger from farming practices.

Figure out what is the highest value (steak/egg/cheese/dried fish- smelly stuff) then try this:\n\n3 days, 3 times a day.\nHer dogs go out. You open your door & scatter food inside the house but next to the door. Once your dog is there, you cue \"yes\" the second she moves her focus (ear turn, eye turn, head turn) towards the outside. And you toss a piece of food on the ground. (You're teaching, stay here while understanding dogs are around, it is rewarding). You can break up the stress a bit by also tossing food further into the house & 'saftey'.
