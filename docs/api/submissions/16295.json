{"id": 16295, "submission_id": "136qf04", "title": "WIBTA to insist my neighbor keep a yard schedule?", "selftext": "For background I have a severely reactive rescue dog. She's terrified of other dogs and freaks out majorly when she sees them or hears them. My partner and I have been working with our vet and a behavioral trainer and we've made some progress, but my dog is still not truly comfortable anywhere but her own yard.\n\nA new lady just moved in next door, and she has two big dogs. They seem like nice dogs, they are quiet and she works with them a lot. The problem is that she works from home full time, and her dogs are always outside. She doesn't leave them there for hours or anything, but I never know when she's going to let them out or for how long. She also spends a lot of time out there with them after work and on weekends. I can hear her training and playing fetch or she'll have them out with her while she's doing yard work.\n\nTo be fair to her, she trains them and she doesn't let them run up on the fence, and if they do bark, she makes them go inside. They're still out on the other side of the fence though and my dog is now scared and reacting in her own backyard. When my dog starts carrying on, she is the one who has to go inside. She already can't enjoy walks and now she can't even enjoy being outside.\n\nI asked my neighbor if she'd consider a schedule for the dogs so that my dog can enjoy her yard too without the neighbor's dogs freaking her out on the other side of the fence. She was polite about it but said no, she bought the house with the yard for her dogs, and they use it. She said she'd be glad to tell me when she's leaving with them for a period of hours, but otherwise she's not going to change what she's doing day to day. So nothing changed and her dogs get plenty of outdoor time and mine gets none except for the stray times when she takes one of her dogs to a training class or takes both of them for a hike. I'm really upset and want to insist that we adopt a schedule so that my dog can have some outside time too.\n\nWIBTA if I insisted she work with me to adopt a schedule that's fair to all the dogs?\n\nEdit so to clarify: My dog does not get the same opportunity as her dogs, not even close. Her dogs have free access five days a week, weeknights, and weekends. My dog only gets outside time now when she says she is leaving for a class or a hike. If I let my dog out to sun herself at 10:30 on a Tuesday, sure enough, it won't be five minutes before she's letting her dogs out and then my dog freaks out and has to come in. She is not getting anywhere close to what they are getting.\n\nEdit again the fence is a privacy fence. My dog freaks out when she can hear and smell the other dogs as well as see them. She can't see these dogs but she knows they're there.", "created_utc": 1683127413, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/136qf04/wibta_to_insist_my_neighbor_keep_a_yard_schedule/", "score": 119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So your framing of \"insisting\" on a yard schedule is a full AH move. \n\nAnd she doesn't need to be consistent. Her dogs are well trained, she clearly watches them and takes them in when they bark, and seems overall lovely. You could say something like- I have a very reactive dog, would it be okay if I text you when she is out, ONCE a day, and ask that you keep your dogs in for 30 minutes or so, so that she can be outside? If I was your neighbor, I'd be okay with that, with the understanding that it won't always work (doesn't see the text message, dogs have to use go to the bathroom, she has plans already, etc). But if I had dogs and I got a text a couple days of week about the other dog being out, I'd be fine accommodating that. \n\nBut only on a temporary basis, so that leads to...are you training and trying to help your reactive dog? You say your poor dog doesn't get to be outside, but that is on you to solve, with training, therapy, etc. Your dog should be able to exist outside with other animals, especially the ones you described. Your dog does need physical exercise, and just being outside in a yard isn't enough. You need to be actively solving this problem for your dog, because that is what is best for your dog.

If he was ever over threshold I would create more distance between him and his trigger. He\u2019s now 2 years strong without a reaction. I feel for you, a reactive dog is hard and exhausting but it is 100% your responsibility to help your dog navigate the world as it exists. It is not the world\u2019s responsibility to cater to you.

She's terrified of other dogs and freaks out majorly when she sees them or hears them. My partner and I have been working with our vet and a behavioral trainer and we've made some progress, but my dog is still not truly comfortable anywhere but her own yard.\n\nA new lady just moved in next door, and she has two big dogs. They seem like nice dogs, they are quiet and she works with them a lot. The problem is that she works from home full time, and her dogs are always outside. She doesn't leave them there for hours or anything, but I never know when she's going to let them out or for how long. She also spends a lot of time out there with them after work and on weekends. I can hear her training and playing fetch or she'll have them out with her while she's doing yard work.\n\nTo be fair to her, she trains them and she doesn't let them run up on the fence, and if they do bark, she makes them go inside. They're still out on the other side of the fence though and my dog is now scared and reacting in her own backyard. When my dog starts carrying on, she is the one who has to go inside. She already can't enjoy walks and now she can't even enjoy being outside.\n\nI asked my neighbor if she'd consider a schedule for the dogs so that my dog can enjoy her yard too without the neighbor's dogs freaking her out on the other side of the fence. She was polite about it but said no, she bought the house with the yard for her dogs, and they use it. She said she'd be glad to tell me when she's leaving with them for a period of hours, but otherwise she's not going to change what she's doing day to day. So nothing changed and her dogs get plenty of outdoor time and mine gets none except for the stray times when she takes one of her dogs to a training class or takes both of them for a hike. I'm really upset and want to insist that we adopt a schedule so that my dog can have some outside time too.\n\nWIBTA if I insisted she work with me to adopt a schedule that's fair to all the dogs?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I have a skittish golden retriever puppy who is scared of everything and everyone the first time she sees it/them and sometimes she just decides she is still going to be scared later. Like with suitcases. We\u2019re lucky enough to have a big field behind our house where dogs can go play off leash, and the first time she saw me open the gate to out there, she was not cool with it. But she trusted me enough to let me bring her out to take a look, and once she saw her brothers playing like it was nothing at all (because they go out there all the time), she was perfectly happy to run around and have fun because she trusted me and I am safe for her. Because she trusts me and I am safe for her and she trusts the rest of our family and we are safe for her, we have made a big deal out of teaching her the \u201cwatch me\u201d command so that when she\u2019s skittish or frightened we can have her look at us and see that we are calm and in control of the situation and everything is okay. That\u2019s what your dog needs, for you to be calm and in control and not agitated, because if you are agitated, so is she. She\u2019s already reactive, so instead of you being reactive too, try being calm and making her look at you so that she can settle.

Let me offer some practical advice from personal experience: I've fostered reactive dogs and we have a privacy fence and our neighbors all have dogs. The fence-barking was insane. You say they can't see each other but they can. So we bought some tarps, trimmed them to the full size of the fence, and attached them solidly along the fence, covering all the cracks between the boards. It made a HUGE difference. There are even fence barrier products you can buy (it is essentially a trap, just precut and probably better quality). Sure, they can still hear the dog and know it's there but the \"threat\" is diminished, and the barking/fence running all but disappeared. Another thing you can do is an interior fence. Just a few feet from the privacy fence in your yard, erect another kind of fence. Cheap wire or whatever. Keep the dog from being able to get up so close. You can even do pretty landscaping between the two fences if you want it to look nice. I sympathize with you because I've been through it and it is hard but also as a dog owner who specifically chose a fenced yard for my dogs I'd think your request was absurd and there isn't a chance I'd agree to it. Sorry.", "Insisting on a schedule is not fair or right. BUT, you could ask your neighbor if you could have 6-7am and 8-9pm, or something, that you daily let your dog out and she avoids letting hers out if possible. Pick times that are probably not convenient for her and would be easily avoidable. Offer a half hour instead of an hour if an hour isn\u2019t doable. And accept that if she says yes, it\u2019s her being kind, not because she \u201cshould\u201d or has to or anything, and maybe find out what treats/toys her dogs like and bring some over for her as a thank you - even if she says no.

You do no get to decide when you\u2019re neighbor use their fenced yard, it\u2019s your dog and your problem. You even state yourself that her dogs are trained and just because your dog has a problem the world does not have to accommodate them.", "You 'want' a schedule. But your neighbour is not there to give in to your 'wants'\n\nyou asked - she answered - thats the end of it", "But that\u2019s not an option and you have to accept that. Your neighbor is free to use her yard anytime as she pleases as is her right. I understand that it\u2019s set you back with your dog but it\u2019s time to move forward as the schedule is not on the table.", "Part of making progress is sometimes falling back a bit when you hit the next big step. Sorry to say it, but your dog getting \"better\" because they never had to be around other dogs because your yard had no other dogs to encounter around or in it, isn't really getting better because the dog's problem isn't being alone, it's being around other dogs. You aren't entitled to her makingor following a schedule. If anything it's on you to make a schedule for *yourself and your dog* and stick to it, regardless of if her dogs are outside, so that way your dog can ACTUALLY work on the problem instead of being allowed to run away from it. Your dog is going to bark? Buy the neighbors some ear plugs and warn them you're going to start exposure training your dog and they may be barking and you apologize in advance, like parents in apartment buildings sleep training their children. If your dog is going to get aggressive, get it a muzzle because muzzles are tools for safety and training not torture devices or an inherent sign of a \"bad\" dog. Your dog is never going to learn other dogs aren't all dangerous if you never show him that or allow him to be exposed to it long enough for him to understand that.", "I feel for your situation but you sound exhausting.  Also, although no you shouldn't immediately give up on a dog if it has issues, it's also ok to admit you are not the right person for this dog and it may be more suited to another handler.\n\nIf the entire world has to accommodate your dogs needs, then perhaps it's not the right fit for you.", "I feel for you and your dog, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re understanding what other people are saying. You\u2019re neighbor bought a house and piece of land and has every right to use that piece of land for their dogs. As a neighbor who loves dogs and who has a somewhat reactive dog, if you came to me with this proposition, I think even I wouldn\u2019t be able to say yes. It\u2019s tough to work around my own work schedule and life with my dog let alone a neighbors as well. \n\nI know you say there\u2019s no other options, but it is up to YOU to figure something out. Not your neighbor. Try more training. Work more on positive associations, ex. Open bar close bar, or more desensitizing. Maybe sound proof your fencing some. Maybe try that app that rents private space for your dog to give your pup a safe space to release energy. And ultimately, if you have exhausted all options and can\u2019t make something work, consider if your pups quality of life would be better in a different home that has no close by neighbors.\n\nAgain, I understand the struggle, but YWBTA if you continue to push this with your neighbor after they told you no and are already telling you when they leave for long periods of time.", "I did this with an old neighbor that had big aggressive dogs. Just added some extra fencing so my dogs couldn\u2019t get right up to the fence. Worked great", "Thank you for saying this. I really didn't know it was okay to do this. I thought it would be the worst thing I could do and we'd be failing her."]}
