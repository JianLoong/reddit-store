Everything about her grates on my nerves and her very presence can instantly darken my mood. For the sake of family peace, I\u2019ve kept all of this bottled up. I try to keep contacts with her to a minimum but if we have to be in the same room together, I\u2019m always civil and polite. No one knows my true feelings toward her. \n\nMy dislike of SIL stems from her belief that she knows everything. No matter the topic of discussion, she\u2019ll have an opinion. Most of her knowledge are flat out wrong and the ones that are correct, she only has surface level knowledge but will hold herself out to be an expert. A perfect example and the reason why I\u2019m here is the following situation. \n\nRecently we had a family gathering where my niece (my sister\u2019s daughter, not SIL\u2019s) and her husband asked me for advice about buying their 1st home. The reason why they asked me is because my side hustle is collecting rental properties. I own about 3 dozen rental properties (residential and commercial), have a great working relationship with a couple of real estate agents and contractors, and have a personal relationship with the bank that finances most of my purchases. \n\nWe spoke for about 30 mins when SIL overheard and injected herself into our conversation. I would like to point out she and my brother rents and have never own any properties. She started to give contradictory advices that made no sense. Like I told my niece she should never buy a house in a flood zone because flood insurance is expensive and mandatory with a mortgage. SIL started to say that the niece won\u2019t have to pay flood insurance if she doesn\u2019t report to the bank that the house is in a flood zone because several of her friends got away with that. I looked at her like she just farted an arm out of her ear. I told her that\u2019s not how banks work but she argued she knows people who did that. Another example is that I told my niece that she should wait and work on increasing her FICO score while lowering her debt to income ratio in order to get the best possible rate. SIL asked what a FICO score is and after I explained it\u2019s the average credit score of the 3 main credit agencies, SIL told my niece she should just turn in the highest score and not the average. Once again, I told her that\u2019s not how banks work.\n\nAfter several terrible advices, I lost my temper and told her to mind her own business and keep her incorrect opinions to herself. This made her cry and started an argument between me and my brother. Our parents want me to apologize but I think it\u2019s time someone tells her she doesn\u2019t know everything.", "created_utc": 1670682664, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhty12/aita_for_telling_my_sil_she_needs_to_keep_her/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What your SIL did was disrespectful to you and a potential mess for your niece if she got confused and followed the advice.", "NTA - Your SIL was being rude with a massive helping of arrogant ignorance. People who stomp all over the conversations of others when they don't actually have the knowledge they claim are a major PITA. Every now and then they just have to be slapped down because nothing else gets their attention. She was actually recommending that your niece commit fraud which is totally out of line. She deserved exactly what you gave her.", "NTA- I can see how that would get annoying. Sure, you could have always been more polite about it or left the conversation but she just probably would have kept doing it. She could have also seriously screwed over your niece too.", "NTA. Please do not apologize. She desperately needed to know what an unbearable moron she is behaving like.", "NTA Sometimes it's not what you say but how you say it. You could have gotten your point across with out losing your temper. Family's are complex and everyone has a know it all opinionated relative that's dumber than a box of rocks. Your family is no exception.", "NTA- \n\nI'd tell them. First- she inserted herself into a conversation where I was specifically asked me about a subject in which I have extensive experience and she has none. She was repeatedly interrupting and providing factually incorrect information and arguing with me about something that she has no education or expertise of any kind. If she doesn't want to be told to mind her business, then she ought to just mind it on her own rather than rudely interject herself and actually provide harmful suggestions.", "I think it's a miracle you've managed not to blow up until now. Unfortunately family dynamics are sensitive and you may want to apologize for your temper while making it clear thats all you are apologizing for. You should absolutely not apologize for the actual message.", "Oh my hell NTA but your family sure are.", "NTA \nYou put her in her place. \nShe is annoying me and I haven\u2019t even met her.\nI knew people like her, and they are annoying AF.\nOne doesn\u2019t want to be rude and correct them and fight for word. but one day it\u2019s just too much to handle", "Nah. The niece is an adult though and probably had the ability to vet circumstance around information herself if the SIL was already asking for definitions. I\u2019m not sure why your brother cares what you said except that it may have seemed disproportionate or to take the low road against someone clearly not in your financial situation. Probably would recommend talking to your husband about how you actually feel because bottling stuff up isn\u2019t healthy", "NTA.", "YTA simply for being a landlord lmao, \"side hustle is collecting properties\" hahaha, stop being a leech on society", "ESH. Your sister-in-law doesn\u2019t know about purchasing real estate and should not have kept offering advice. But it sounds to me like you overreacted. What sensible person would take the nonsense advice she offered? Is your niece sensible? You admit you don\u2019t like your SIL, and this dislike may have contributed to your response.\n\nIt sounds like you are fairly well-off and knowledgeable if you own and manage several dozen rental properties. And, if your sister-in-law rents and doesn\u2019t know about FICO scores, she may have fewer advantages than you. Could she be trying to impress you and everyone around her by giving advice? People often behave in certain ways for a reason.", "NTA,  I'm constantly amazed at how people constantly rally around morons and demand that everyone tiptoe around people who are horrible to be in social situations with. \n\nThe only reason SIL is like this now is because no one cared enough to take the time to explain to her that her behavior makes everyone hate to be around her.  She needed to learn this more than anything else.  Her parents failed her miserably, and she'll be a social outcast for the rest of her life unless people like OP put her in her place.\n\nSIL is not a third grade child who doesn't get the math lesson, so everyone has to boost her spirits so she can still try.  She didn't get an answer wrong on a test. She failed to learn the basics of social interaction.  You did her a favor that apparently no one else ever has.\n\nIt's as if she keeps putting her hand in a flame, and she's been taught to blame the candle.", "Yeah , SIL is annoying & wrong but you lost your temper . Apologize for only that part of it .", "NTA, i'm annoyed, as a stranger on the internet who owns only one house but knows what a fico score is lol.", "<<No one knows my true feelings toward her.>>\n\nKeep telling yourself that, otherwise you'll have to admit you're an asshole too.\n\n\"Losing your temper\" because your SIL is expressing her random uninformed opinion on a subject is ridiculous.  Quit acting like your niece and her husband are fools who can't make their own assessment of the advice they are being offered. You had already had a 30-min discussion with your niece about this, surely that's enough time for them to decide whether you're worth listening to.\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here. Multiple know-it-alls.", "YTA. While your SIL may not have been giving the best advice, it was not your place to tell her to keep her opinions to herself and to mind her own business. You could have politely corrected her or redirected the conversation without belittling her. Your behavior was disrespectful and caused unnecessary conflict.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo: Don't engage with SIL, just tell your niece: \"Listening to many people is good. Just look at the property owning experience people have, and go from that when deciding whom to believe about property management.\"  Then drop it.", "Advices is not the plural of advice.
