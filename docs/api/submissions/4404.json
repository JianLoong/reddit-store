Everything about her grates on my nerves and her very presence can instantly darken my mood. For the sake of family peace, I\u2019ve kept all of this bottled up. I try to keep contacts with her to a minimum but if we have to be in the same room together, I\u2019m always civil and polite. No one knows my true feelings toward her. \n\nMy dislike of SIL stems from her belief that she knows everything. No matter the topic of discussion, she\u2019ll have an opinion. Most of her knowledge are flat out wrong and the ones that are correct, she only has surface level knowledge but will hold herself out to be an expert. A perfect example and the reason why I\u2019m here is the following situation. \n\nRecently we had a family gathering where my niece (my sister\u2019s daughter, not SIL\u2019s) and her husband asked me for advice about buying their 1st home. The reason why they asked me is because my side hustle is collecting rental properties. I own about 3 dozen rental properties (residential and commercial), have a great working relationship with a couple of real estate agents and contractors, and have a personal relationship with the bank that finances most of my purchases. \n\nWe spoke for about 30 mins when SIL overheard and injected herself into our conversation. I would like to point out she and my brother rents and have never own any properties. She started to give contradictory advices that made no sense. Like I told my niece she should never buy a house in a flood zone because flood insurance is expensive and mandatory with a mortgage. SIL started to say that the niece won\u2019t have to pay flood insurance if she doesn\u2019t report to the bank that the house is in a flood zone because several of her friends got away with that. I looked at her like she just farted an arm out of her ear. I told her that\u2019s not how banks work but she argued she knows people who did that. Another example is that I told my niece that she should wait and work on increasing her FICO score while lowering her debt to income ratio in order to get the best possible rate. SIL asked what a FICO score is and after I explained it\u2019s the average credit score of the 3 main credit agencies, SIL told my niece she should just turn in the highest score and not the average. Once again, I told her that\u2019s not how banks work.\n\nAfter several terrible advices, I lost my temper and told her to mind her own business and keep her incorrect opinions to herself. This made her cry and started an argument between me and my brother. Our parents want me to apologize but I think it\u2019s time someone tells her she doesn\u2019t know everything.", "created_utc": 1670682664, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhty12/aita_for_telling_my_sil_she_needs_to_keep_her/", "score": 710, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She needed to learn this more than anything else.  Her parents failed her miserably, and she'll be a social outcast for the rest of her life unless people like OP put her in her place.\n\nSIL is not a third grade child who doesn't get the math lesson, so everyone has to boost her spirits so she can still try.  She didn't get an answer wrong on a test. She failed to learn the basics of social interaction.
