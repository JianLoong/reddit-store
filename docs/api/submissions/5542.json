For bonus points, Make it a fun game with your kid.\n\n2. Airhorn.", "INFO: Why couldn't your daughter have both yours and your wife's last names?", "So ask your wife to share the joke with you.  You have told her you don't think it's funny and that it's disrespectful.  All your wife is doing is making excuses for her mom's bad behavior.  Personally I would go NC with her mom and keep your daughter away from her.", "She ain't going to hyphenate it, she just saying that to make you happy. If her mother that crazy about your daughter not having her last name, you think she going to be ok with her own daughter changing it by that too?", "NTA. My grandparents could never get my name wrong, and it's all of 4 letters and not crazy in any way. Makes you feel horrible that someone who claims to care abt you can't even bother learning smth simple like your name. \n\nSame applies to her last name, it's not like you strongarmed your wife *she agreed!!!* Even if I don't understand yr last naming logic it made enough sense to both of you you agreed to it. \n\nI can see within the next few years your ILs giving daughter the money for a name change as a \"joke\"", "NTA.  \nYour MiL needs to stay in her lane. It's between you and your wife, and frankly, you should have stepped on that right away, instead of letting her get away with it. And your wife should be calling out her mother, as well.", "NTA, but you need to have a fight with your wife really. You two are supposed to be a team, and your mother-in-law is going actively out of her way to treat your kid wrong and your wife is allowing it to happen. She is allowing her mother-in-law to come in and disrespect you and your child. Her actively talking to you like you are the antagonist and rushing it to the defense of her mother is her saying that she is not on you or your kids side and actively supports the antagonist in your house.\n\nYour mother-in-law should immediately pack her bags and leave, and then you and your wife need to have it out, and then determine whether or not your wife is willing to put in the work she needs to to keep your marriage going", "NTA. This is not the first time this has happened. Your MIL is out of line. Your wife enables this.", "NTA.  This is a hill to die in.  They are messing with your kid\u2019s identity.  Let your wife know she has two choices: 1) no more of this stuff and the family stays with intact or 2) the marriage is terminated, your kid\u2019s name is a settled prong of the divorce decree, and any attempt by her parents to misstate the kid\u2019s name will be cited as an incident of parental alienation to support a protective order barring their contact with the kid.", "Orrrrr they made an agreement on what they would name their baby if it was a girl and it was a girl so they named her as agreed \u201cof course.\u201d", "There us something wrong with it when they harrass op for years. Holy shit they are ahs for not letting this go by now. The kid has a name. Move the fuck on.", "She absolutely does not. Given how she jumped in when you interjected, she knows it's a fight but is trying to convince you that you're being ridiculous.", "First, NTA.  Second, you have bigger problems brewing. Your MIL is being intentional and aggressive.  Your wife is being deliberately obtuse and dismissive.  If you two can't get on the same page this will just escalate.", "Right, but if she's allowing her mother so much deciding power not only in her life, but yours and your child, if your mother-in-law wants her to go through it again, your wife more than likely will. Given that your wife does not have her own opinions and it's her mother's flying monkey, you shouldn't look at the possibility of her decisions being made based on her own will, but by what your mother-in-law wants", "She probably thinks even if she does get married she will keep her name like your wife did. And if she decides not too she will probably bully her in to submission like she's trying now.", "Wait til this kid goes to school and gets called by one name there, and one from MIL. It will piss MIL down the road when the kid has to write and spell her birth name, and not the last name MIL is doing. Op's wife and MIL are doing a serious disservice to this child by calling her the wrong last name. Soon the kid will need therapy too all because the wife and MIL can't stop harping on a name. They need to get it together.", "If she's allowing her mother to even have a foothold in this conversation, you can't listen to anything she's telling you cuz you're not having a two-way conversation", "NTA, your wife is enabling your MIL disrespectful behavior. You did the right thing telling her to leave.", "Everyone gets the dudes last name\n\nNTA", "NTA, your inlaws don't respect you or your family's name. Honesty time though, do they pay for you to have the life you have? Are you a \"kept man\" funded by your Wife's wealth through her family? Monetary power dynamics within a relationship can cause all sorts of problems with boundaries. If you accept their monetary patronage then you are tacitly accepting their control and making yourself subservient to your inlaws decisions. In that case your still NTA, unless you have been a completely dependent on their financial support in which case YTA. But only cause freedom isn't \"free\" it's earned either through your work and sacrifice, or the Inlaws charity and patronage of you the person they see as subservient.", "What makes it \u201cawkward\u201d is you mil continually misnaming your daughter.  Your wife is an asshole for allowing this to continue to happen.\n\n  NTA.\n\nNext time she brings presents over that have the wrong name on them, tell her no one by that name lives with you and don\u2019t allow your daughter to receive them.", "NTA\n\nTell her she can attend the dinner tomorrow alone, without you and your daughter unless her mother apologizes \"so it won't be awkward\"\n\nEdit to add: this would be well suited for r/justnomil you'd probably find some amazing ideas to handle this MIL if you post there as well.", "This. Hyphenated with your name last.", "It's a little unclear, but I think you're misreading it. The \"she\" in \"Of course, she ended up taking my last name\" refers to the daughter, not the wife. If I'm not mistaken, OP confirmed in a comment that the wife did not take his last name.", "Or calling 3 year old kids by their last name... At least in western countries that is really not common. I only got called by my *full* name if i really messed up... \ud83e\udee3", "If she thinks it\u2019s so funny, why isn\u2019t she laughing when you told her mom to leave?", "Option A, She's lying to you and actively enabling her mother. \n\nOr option B, she doesn't respect you at all. \n\nEither way, dude, this is not good. You don't have an In-Law problem, you have a wife problem. You need to skip all interaction with the in-law's until you figure out the issues inside your own marriage. They're just throwing gasoline on an existing fire.", "No she doesn't. Shes probably finding that this is a way to pressure you without actually looking like shes backtracking on your deal. It's no longer joking around if it's hurting your feelings and insulting you. Once you voiced your feelings she should have put a stop to it. If she thought it was so \"innocent\" it should be no big deal to ask her mother to stop.", "It seems they think you meant the \"of course\" about your wife taking your last name when I believe it was actually about your daughter", "Maybe it\u2019s time to rethink that.", "Me, too! Full first, middle and last name!! It was horrible!!", "Our kids have a hyphenated last name, so they get both our names. Just an idea if you end up having kiddos and don't want to risk this nonsense happening to you.", "Perhaps you should start addressing your wife by your last name. Will she think that\u2019s funny?", "They are being very disrespectful. They named their kids, you get to name yours. Due to their behavior, if you have any more children, none of them should be given their last name. It's not your fault they don't have a son to carry on their name.", "NTA \n\nWife should've shut that shit down. Instead she enabled her mother and didn't give a fuck about how it effected you. Pretty shitty of her", "What was the \u201cagreement\u201d?", "Did you not read the whole post?\n\n\n>When my wife was pregnant, we agreed if the baby was was to be born a girl, she would take my last name. If it was a boy, it would be her last name. Of course, she ended up taking my last name.", "Wife didn't want that.", "Middle?! Wth did you do? \ud83e\udee3\ud83d\ude02", "Spilling Kool-Aid on the newly washed kitchen floor, not coming home when my mom called me home, which was the most embarrassing part! She'd yell your full name from the front porch for the whole neighborhood to hear and everyone knew you were in deep trouble! \ud83d\ude02", "Oooh, the second one i can really feel... \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05 I always had to be home at 17.00, well, one time i forgot while playing with the neighbour's daughter\ud83e\udee3"]}
