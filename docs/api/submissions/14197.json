{"id": 14197, "submission_id": "12edma0", "title": "AITA for embarrassing my wife in front of our family when she tried to flex about how she is an amazing SAHM?", "selftext": "I (41M) am married to my wife Terri (40F) and we have two girls (13F + 12F). I work a full time job in sales and she has been a SAH wife/mom our entire marriage. This was completely by her choice even though we could have afforded childcare when our girls were little if she had chosen to not quit her job.\n\nI will admit, we have been having a lot of struggles in our marriage recently because I feel as there is an imbalance in the amount of time and effort we each put into our household. Some examples include:\n\n1) Although I work full time (8am-4pm M-F) and she is the stay at home parent, I am the one who wakes the girls up every morning, gets them ready for school, and packs their snacks and bags. Terri claims she\u2019s just \u201ctoo much of a night owl\u201d to wake up at 7am to get the girls ready for school.\n\n2) The girls will take the bus home and Terri will just take them to any practices or extracurriculars they have after school and that\u2019s it. She drives them around and stays at games for 1-2 hours max per day.\n\n3) When she chose to be a SAHM, it was our agreement that she would handle cooking meals and the cleaning/upkeep of our home and we would both split childcare 50/50. Yet it\u2019s become that she doesn\u2019t want to clean or cook anymore either to the point where it\u2019s all falling on me on top of my job. The girls have even called me at night when I had a work conference saying their mom hasn\u2019t made dinner and told them to \u201cJust get some snacks\u201d and wanted me to order food to the house because they\u2019re hungry.\n\nIt\u2019s been extremely hard because I feel like a single parent, and I honestly wouldn\u2019t even be this frustrated if she at least worked and I also worked while taking care of everything else. She simply doesn\u2019t do anything to add value to our household. Adding for clarity: we have had a conversation about this imbalance many times but she doesn\u2019t want to change anything because she is \u201ccomfortable\u201d with how things are at the moment.\n\nRecently, my family came over for dinner and my parents were complimenting how the house was so well kept to which Terri had to go above and beyond to talk about how hard she works to maintain our home and she\u2019s someone who has grown to really care about keeping up appearances with others. (She then went into more detail the entire night during dinner about she cares for our family and home day and night and all this bs). In reality, I had spent four hours from the moment I got home from work scrubbing every last room in our house because Terri had decided it was more important to have lunch plans that day with her friends.\n\nThis just completely pissed me off after the hours I already put in taking care of the girls, going to work, and cleaning the whole place and cooking the dinner. So I told my family exactly that, that it was all me and I\u2019ve been handling it alone infront of Terri. Now she is saying I\u2019m such an AH for embarrassing her and a bad husband and at this point I\u2019m so over it I\u2019d rather just be a single dad and move on with my life I don\u2019t even feel bad anymore. I\u2019m just so exhausted of asking over and over again for her to simply just do her job.

Honestly, you\u2019d be financially (and emotionally) better off without her \u2026", "NTA. I\u2019ll share my family experience here. My parents have three daughters in total (including me - the youngest). When my oldest sister was a kid, my mom decided to be SAHM despite her Sister In Laws saying that women should always have their own career. But my parents could not afford an extra helper at home. My mum also do not want help from her Mother in Law who was already taking care of many other grandchildren. So my parents came to an agreement for my mum to be SAHM and she would take over household chores. My dad works full time while taking night classes for a part time degree and still does his parenting duties. \n\nWhen I was 9 or 10 years old, my parents trust that I can take care of myself for a few hours after school and also know I could wake up early by myself to prepare for school. My mum started going out to work part time and have more time to hangout with her friends, whose kids also grew up. My dad could take on managerial jobs in his industry. Now, we are in our 20s to 30s. My dad has saved enough retirement fund for both himself and my mom if he decides to retire soon. My mum is the only one getting monthly allowance from her three kids and husband though she still goes out to work. In recent years, we could afford better household equipments like robot vacuums to lighten our load on daily chores as well. \n\nI think you should have a serious discussion with your wife again since she is not taking on the responsibilities which both of you agreed upon. Have a discussion on whether she is willing to start to work again so that both of you could afford childcare, though parenting duties and doing basic chores are still required even if she starts to work. I know that it is really tough and mentally tiring if one parent does everything. \n\nMaybe have a timeframe and if things does not get better over next few months, you can then consider a split or separation for your own mental health. Another possible idea is to let your wife know in what ways your children can be affected by her behavior since both parents are role models to them. Food takeouts are not healthy in a long run either and basic cleaning need to be done for hygiene purposes since kids are around.", "According to your comments you knew how she was before you married her.

Husband used to complain I did nothing around the house. At the time, I worked 3 days a week.

She did not have PPD and does not have any other mental or physical illnesses/disabilities. When we first got married and didn\u2019t have kids yet, there was definitely a huge imbalance because I was doing everything then too, but she started taking on some childcare responsibilities after we had kids. But she has always done this thing where she\u2019ll let things sit for days on days until I get sick of it and end up cleaning it myself.", "Unfortunately she is a Tony. Sorry to hear your family had to deal with it too. I\u2019ve been in complete support and encouragement to go back to work at least part time ever since the kids got older and were in school for longs periods of time.

It doesn't sound like he did immediately either but only after she kept on going and embellishing the lie. I don't think keeping quiet to save face benefits anyone but the liar in this situation. What does that teach the kids? When someone is sitting there lying and taking credit for your work you are supposed to sit there quietly and wait to have a respectful conversation later? A person this bold needs to be called to the carpet and embarrassed or they will just brush it off, like poor OP's wife has done every time he has tried to have a respectful talk about this imbalance previously. I think OP is right to be thinking he would be better off a single dad. The only counselling that will get through to his wife is a lawyer serving her divorce papers.", "No, she has never been diagnosed with any mental/physical illnesses or disabilities.

And, OP staying quiet in that moment (allowing his wife to take credit for his efforts/ allowing people to develop an untrue perception of how hard his wife works to take care of the home) is not at all fair to OP. Imo, OP was 100% in the right; lying in front of his family with him right there was incredibly bold, and she deserved to be called out and deserves the impending divorce. OP is NTA", "So the wife can go on and on and LIE about how hard she works and how she does everything in the house but OP is An AH for correcting her.. I don\u2019t think so", "It\u2019d be inappropriate if he brought it up out of nowhere but they\u2019ve had multiple conversations about how this is affecting him and she goes out of her way to take all the credit? No she deserved to be called out like that. Maybe now she\u2019ll make a change that everyone sees her for who she is. They\u2019ve discussed it privately already", "I think the question you are asking is, am I an imminent divorce'?", "She's not your wife, she's your extra kid.", "These darn Tonys...if you think about it,  everytime you ask her or talk to her about chores and doesn't do it...she's saying FU to you directly each time. How many FUs can you take? It took my sister 14 years to wake up, don't be like my sister.", "NTA - you probably need to have along talk with her about whether this union is a good fit for you long term. Hopefully she can make an effort to pitch in. Sorry bud.", "Has she actually been to a therapist? Depression can take on many forms. Tons of people seem completely great on the outside until they break inside and take their own lives. She should seek counseling and if she won\u2019t go alone try couples counseling so you can at least address the imbalance you are feeling in the relationship.", "Feel so sorry for this guy.  He made a deal when he got married and he got shafted.   Also, if he goes for divorce, he will lose even more.  Its so unfair to him.  Feel really sorry for the guy", "Pretty sure the kids are more responsible", "He knew how she was before marriage and kids. Why did he assume she'd just change all of a sudden. Yes she is the asshole but he shouldn't have expected a miracle when the kids arrived."]}
