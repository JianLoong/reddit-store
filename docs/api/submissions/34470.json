He would hold me, arm under my butt and my legs around his waist. I still think it's super hot, but shortly after we'd moved out, he got hurt. He jumped up a ride on lawn mower into a gopher hole in tall grass and completely fed up his ankle.\n\nUnfortunately, he can't support my weight comforably anymore, and he probably never will be able to again. We were 18 when this happened, and through we'd been together for I while, some ppl expected that I'd leave him.\n\nWe've been together now for 14 years and I love him to pieces. Sometimes, when he's feeling really romantic, he'll even pick me up. He thinks it's funny how much I worry when he does that, and say he loves how much I care even when I lost something I loved.\n\nYour hubby is abusing you and he thinks it's funny to hurt you.
