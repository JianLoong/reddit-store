Before my project director left he recommended me for the position to the CEO (I did not know about this at first) and I was at this point doing such an excellent job that we completed objectives that hadn\u2019t been completed in years within my short stint at the organization.\n\nNow as a result I have seniority because of the project director leaving (8 months into the job) and during that time the CEO asked me if could do the position. I hesitated at first because the large scope of the project and I was new in reporting data. I told her if I can have a week got let her know and she said that we can definitely do that. Within that week I worked my ass off studying the project and worked with my former supervisor in tandem to get the hang of things, which gave a me a lot of confidence that I could do this. \n\nSo fast forward a week later and the CEO sits me down to tell me the great news. First I\u2019m getting a raise of one dollar, and second that a coworker who works in a totally different department with no grasp of what our program is now going to be my project director (along with a $6 raise). He does immigration and I do tobacco control. The reasoning according to the CEO is because he has managerial experience (so did I). \n\nSo already I\u2019m crushed by the news, and after a few days of letting it settle in, the newly appointed project director begins to ask me when do I have time to train him. I agree to help him and told him Friday. He switches it to Monday on my remote day, which I refused and told him Tuesday is possible. We never follow up on any of this because he gets busy with immigration work.  During following weeks my coworker, the interns, and our CEO are coming up to me to delegate. At this point rage begins to simmer in me and I begin to refuse to do things that a project director is supposed to be doing, delegating, managing interns, etc. I refuse to train my new boss because it\u2019s neither my responsibility and it\u2019s not in my job description and I begin to do the bare minimum because I realized that there\u2019s no point to it anymore. The CEO in retaliation begins to nickel and dime me on my gas reimbursement and cheated me of $100, which was so severe that our accountant out of pity fought to claw back at least $30 more bucks for me.  So at this point I am quiet quitting and looking for new work.

All the other project assistants there when I started had quit within a year. That left me as most senior and in a position to move up to the project manager role.\n\nInstead, they had the departing program manager run interviews, and she selected as her replacement an absolutely unqualified and difficult person. Chosen specifically out of spite for the organization based on her exasperated comments following the person's interview.\n\nSo then I had to train my new manager on not just what our assistant job was but also how to do her manager role.

Better to jump and fail than overthink and lose the opportunity.\n\nIf you want to roll the dice;  Go to the CEO and explain the 'why' you are where you are--that you asked for time to review the full scope, which you did and were ready to 'jump' - they came back and revoked the offer presenting it as good news.
