I was worried because the funding for our program has one year left on it. After multiple resignations and people being transferred out of the program, it was me and one coworker handling a project that covers 7 cities.  Before my project director left he recommended me for the position to the CEO (I did not know about this at first) and I was at this point doing such an excellent job that we completed objectives that hadn\u2019t been completed in years within my short stint at the organization.\n\nNow as a result I have seniority because of the project director leaving (8 months into the job) and during that time the CEO asked me if could do the position. I hesitated at first because the large scope of the project and I was new in reporting data. I told her if I can have a week got let her know and she said that we can definitely do that. Within that week I worked my ass off studying the project and worked with my former supervisor in tandem to get the hang of things, which gave a me a lot of confidence that I could do this. \n\nSo fast forward a week later and the CEO sits me down to tell me the great news. First I\u2019m getting a raise of one dollar, and second that a coworker who works in a totally different department with no grasp of what our program is now going to be my project director (along with a $6 raise). He does immigration and I do tobacco control. The reasoning according to the CEO is because he has managerial experience (so did I). \n\nSo already I\u2019m crushed by the news, and after a few days of letting it settle in, the newly appointed project director begins to ask me when do I have time to train him. I agree to help him and told him Friday. He switches it to Monday on my remote day, which I refused and told him Tuesday is possible. We never follow up on any of this because he gets busy with immigration work.  During following weeks my coworker, the interns, and our CEO are coming up to me to delegate. At this point rage begins to simmer in me and I begin to refuse to do things that a project director is supposed to be doing, delegating, managing interns, etc. I refuse to train my new boss because it\u2019s neither my responsibility and it\u2019s not in my job description and I begin to do the bare minimum because I realized that there\u2019s no point to it anymore. The CEO in retaliation begins to nickel and dime me on my gas reimbursement and cheated me of $100, which was so severe that our accountant out of pity fought to claw back at least $30 more bucks for me.  So at this point I am quiet quitting and looking for new work.

Turns out he isn't good at math", "NTA. Something similar happened to me. I was hired at a small nonprofit in a project assistant role. All the other project assistants there when I started had quit within a year. That left me as most senior and in a position to move up to the project manager role.\n\nInstead, they had the departing program manager run interviews, and she selected as her replacement an absolutely unqualified and difficult person. Chosen specifically out of spite for the organization based on her exasperated comments following the person's interview.\n\nSo then I had to train my new manager on not just what our assistant job was but also how to do her manager role. It was epic bs and caused years of strife. I should have quit then. Good on you for quitting now.", "Nta. You were screwed over and have every right to leave. Just think twice about burning bridges abruptly like that as it could affect you with future jobs", "NTA you'll never be the ah for quiet quitting (awful term btw its not quitting)", "NTA. \n\nThey\u2019ve shown that you\u2019re of value to them only in the role your in. You\u2019ll never get any promotions. Their word is garbage. Bad management and favoritism from the top down.", "Definitely NTA I have heard similar stories like that before and it's the absolute worst when you have put so much time and effort into things just to have that be the outcome.", "NTA.  Do your actual job description and no more.  Don't volunteer for extra, which includes training your superior.  The manager's superior should be doing that.  Also, it's not quitting if you're still doing your job.  It only seems that way because you, me, and most other working folks are massively overworked and underpaid for the work that is actually happening.", "Just submit an overly nice resignation letter with 2 weeks notice. List an hour or two that you will be available to train people. Then quiet quit and shuffle papers for two weeks.", "NTA - but writing is now on the wall.  Start looking for a new job, especially if you've managed to upset the CEO.  \n\nTake this as a lesson - sadly, instead of seeing your ask for time to consider as a good/thoughtful/conscientious thing; they saw it as a weakness and lack of initiative. Better to jump and fail than overthink and lose the opportunity.\n\nIf you want to roll the dice;  Go to the CEO and explain the 'why' you are where you are--that you asked for time to review the full scope, which you did and were ready to 'jump' - they came back and revoked the offer presenting it as good news. By how upset everyone is with you currently - seems that it's because you are the subject expert being asked to prop-up those around you, including the one who got the job you were offered.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
