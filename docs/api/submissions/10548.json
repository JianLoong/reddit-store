It just doesn't work that way. If you have problems, communicate. Your BF at the very least should be willing to hear you out (if not, he doesn't do his job very well).", "NTA \nI understand where you're coming from, but be careful, cuz reciprocating might make matters worse.

This could probably clear up the situation which might just be a misunderstanding.

If so, I\u2019d make them more regularly so you have a valid reason to not make extra. \n\nI do think the in laws are being passive aggressive and unfair. Perhaps a middle ground would be asking them if they\u2019re home when you are cooking if they\u2019d like some. Make enough for them if so, but making extra just in case is a wasteful and unreasonable. \n\nI would also go for more single serving frozen meals like burritos or Amy\u2019s foods.

The answer to this is better communication and drawing firm boundaries (and sticking to them), not petty revenge. You say you live in their home, and your avoidance of some questions on this post leads me to believe that you're not contributing to the cost of rent/utilities and that you don't really even pay for food. Idk there's alot you're leaving out. \n\nAlso, a quick peek at your post and comment history makes you look incredibly sketchy. This is like your 3rd post to this sub in a week and the only thing you're consistent about is the fact that you and your partner are in a toxic and exhausting relationship. Some of your (mostly deleted) posts say that you're a 28yo woman, but your oldest comment (from 2 weeks ago) is you claiming to be a man who got an STD after using the pull-out method when you lost your virginity and talking about the physical symptoms you experienced on your \"junk.\" Also, ngl it seems a bit off that your account was created in 2021, but the only activity is from the past 14 days.\n\nIdk, if this post is true, you all suck tbh.", "He does.

And even when i don\u2019t buy it\u2019s my bf buying for us which is something that\u2019s supposed to happen anyway. That business is between me and my bf. \nIt\u2019s the situation in the house where something in the kitchen is being made (even if it is the food i bought for myself) i am just expected to give it to everyone or just ALWAYS keep a share. But not the same standards for them.", "I do think if we were married it would be different. \nAnd to answer whether i have somewhere to go or not partially true.

Most people would assume that you\u2019re not paying rent, which means you should be helping out in the house. I\u2019m not saying you should be Cinderella and do all the chores, but if you aren\u2019t paying rent nor is your bf paying rent/utilities you can\u2019t expect respect from his family. And honestly I think that\u2019s what you want. So I would suggest making a family meal once a week with extras and telling them, oh I made extra X on (insert day), you can have some of that but I don\u2019t have enough of why I\u2019m making to share. Also start paying for part of utilities if you want to have a day in the household.", "Ok but are you working and paying rent? I've had this situation before and when I wasn't paying rent while living with my then-bf and his parents because I didn't earn any money, I contributed food (through foodstamps) and cleaned. So this is a situation where it's like what are you personally contributing to the house? Maybe they don't include you in things because they think you're lazy if you bring nothing to the table and rely on their son for everything. Either way, it's time for a family sit-down where everything is put on the table, what you are expected to contribute, what your bf is expected to contribute, and negotiate these terms if they feel unfair, such as making extra food every single time. Maybe a weekly meal chart can be made with who makes what and for what meal and what day.\nForgot to judge, ESH if terms have not been set already because no clear communication causes unnecessary rifts like this. YTA if you're not doing your part in the house.", "Sounds like a tough situation. But have you addressed this with your bf at least?\n\nYou know them Better than I do. But I\u2019ve never seen a situation with things being bad before marriage turning into a happy marriage. It only ever gets worse. Obviously I hope Im wrong.
