Spent life savings after retirement to build a \u201cdream home\u201d which they can\u2019t afford upkeep on but could easily sell for $500k profit and live the rest of their lives (they\u2019re 81 and 71). MIL makes a point to say they\u2019re \u201con a fixed income\u201d every time she can but they piddle a ton of money away on things like new TV\u2019s and just random shit of no real value, and lots of wasted food.

She called her step-grandma of her own accord and said she\u2019d like to contribute her turkey to them to save money on thanksgiving and even drove the two hours round trip to deliver it to them a few days ahead of the holiday. She and I were both very proud of her for this. \n\nCut to thanksgiving and neither MiL or FiL mention the turkey (they\u2019re not really a \u201cthank you\u201d kind of family so it\u2019s not really strange). Husband notices the turkey in the oven is massive so asks his mother where daughters turkey is. She said it wasn\u2019t big enough (it was 13 pounds for 5 meat eaters) so they spent $60 buying another one. Husband told his mother she better not say anything that would hurt daughters feelings and was extremely upset on her behalf and filled me in. After dinner and packing up, he has me grab the original turkey from the (one of two fully stocked) freezer and take it to the car, and told our daughter that we will have a dinner on our own so she can enjoy this damn turkey that she effectively earned herself. He also venmoed his mother the exact amount she paid for her turkey. \n\nThis morning I wake up to texts from MiL accusing me of \u201cstealing food from their mouths\u201d and \u201cthey can\u2019t afford food\u201d  and were planning on making the other one just \u201cfor the two of them\u201d. \n\nTBH, neither of us really give a shit about turkey, but it was a funny way to make our daughter feel better about not being appreciated for the effort she made and gave us a little chuckle on the drive home from listening to MiL and FiL bicker for 6 hours.  \n\nSo, AITA?\n\nETA: I suppose I should mention we also brought 5 of the 7 sides, 2 of the 3 pies, and the wine.

Did your daughter tell them the size before? Maybe once it got there, they realized and went and bought another verus causing problems. Theyre older and this seems extremely petty.

But your MIL accepting the free turkey for thanksgiving and not using it - damn straight you can take that thing back. She was an AH for that to your daughter here.", "Ew.  You stole food from your parents freezer and you have to ask if YTA?  Betting you\u2019re the kind of person that brings a bottle of white to a dinner party and then gets angry that the hostess doesn\u2019t use it because they\u2019re serving beef.  And so you take it back when you leave.  I bow to your pettiness.  \n\nYTA", "NTA - they should have been more grateful and appreciative of what they were given, after all, isn't that the point of Thanksgiving?", "NTA \n\nHow tacky, trying to swindle their granddaughter\u2019s free turkey from work to stock their freezer. The sheer audacity to take advantage of that generosity.", "I\u2019m sorry but you lost me at their excuse for not thanking your daughter. Great excuse", "NTA. Your daughter said the turkey was her contribution for *thanksgiving*, not to stock their freezer. Beyond that, you gave them the money for the turkey they DID buy, so you didn't steal food from their mouths- you actually gave them their main dish and now they have $60 to buy more food. \n\n\nThis would make me not want to spend holidays with them.", "This feels similar to the \"Marble Rye\" episode from Seinfeld. The inlaws were way bigger assholes here but taking back a gift is also faux pas. NTA. I'd go \"justified asshole\" if I could.", "YTA and super tacky. I can't imagine going through someone's fridge and just taking the food home with me. Also if my husband asked me to do it I'd tell him to pound rocks. Like if he wanted the turkey so bad he should have grabbed it himself.", "NTA - I laughed at this one, this is a clear case of justified TA. Good heist.", "NTA but I do kind of understand where the in laws are coming from as far as turkey size is concerned. People might not realize it but 13 lbs is not a big turkey. I\u2019ve seen 40+ lb turkeys and 20 lbs is roughly the size that\u2019s enough for my family. They definitely shouldn\u2019t have kept it to themselves though, that was shitty.", "NTA. That turkey was plenty big enough for the number of people, and your dd contributed a turkey for Thanksgiving dinner, not for their personal use.", "Sorry, NTA. She didn't offer her turkey to them as a gift - she brought it to be eaten at the party. \n\nIf she had brought a tray of dinner rolls or something for potluck and they had hidden them away for themselves instead of serving them, nobody would think that is right.\n\nShe deserves to see her turkey enjoyed, and enjoy it herself.", "NTA. Thank you for the chuckle. I think it's a justified AH because you paid them back and then they made it about the money. \n\nMind you, I understand their reasoning for getting the big turkey. And there could have been some communication instead of the heist beforehand, like when you said to them this is going to hurt the daughter, could have told them they can remedy it by returning it to her and telling her to please enjoy her earned turkey. Most likely, she would have regifted it back anyways. Or not. Either way she sounds like a good kid.", "NTA, and those people are terrible.", "I appreciate your perspective. I forgot to add to the original post that SIL and I team up each year and bring all the sides, drinks, and desserts. A conversation was had about the size of the turkey. \nPetty, yes, but I have never once heard a thank you from this woman\u2019s mouth and this time it was at the expense of my daughter\u2019s feelings.", "The entire food was brought by this family and SIL. The older parents didn't contribute except for the new turkey which this family sent money for. So the older parents literally didn't spend any money on Thanksgiving. Sure, they hosted and cooked their turkey.", "Sorry, I\u2019m trying really hard to see your side, but you lost me at them having to cover the other costs for hosting. From the sounds of it they all still stayed for dinner, they just took the smaller turkey after and paid for the bigger one. Don\u2019t the in laws actually come out ahead here? They can go buy the same size turkey that was stolen and still have money left over, right? Because if so it just sounds to me like they sooking they were called out on their turkey hijinks.", "What! I\u2019ve made an 11 pound turkey for 8 people and had leftovers", "Did you uh... Read the post past the title? Or? Did we find the parents?", "Definitely a YTJA situation.  A good read in any case.", "I just fed 7 people with a 13 pound turkey, and have leftovers. That is plenty big enough for 5 people.", "13 pounds with 7 sides is ABSOLUTELY plenty of food for 5 people. I fed 4 people with an 8 pound turkey and sides with no problem and still leftovers. And definitely NTA", "The rule of thumb is 1-1.5 lbs per person, and that will yield leftovers. A 13 lbs turkey is more than enough for 5 people. Just served a 14 lbs turkey for 7 people, and more than half the turkey is in the fridge and freezer.", "Agreed, my side of the family will do a big turkey and it will get eaten and my mother fully utilizes all the leftovers and carcass. However, this was for 5 people who were eating meat, two of whom were 70+ and one of whom was a 7 year old child. I know for a fact (they have a history of wasting food) that at least half of even the small turkey would be thrown away.", "We had a 14lb turkey for five people and have about half (probably more) left over. 13lbs. is huge unless people are gluttonous pigs about eating.", "My thing is, if there was any merit to the turkey being too small, the in laws should\u2019ve mentioned it during the drop off/asked about the size before accepting it. Instead they pulled the bait and switch.", "You clearly don't have my cousins at your table lol\n\nIt's really variable. Depends on the rest of the meal, the eating habits, and even the birds have a lot of differences.", "Same here\u2026.13 seems to be the average at my grocery store for run ofmthe mill birds\u2026we had six and only ate half our 13 lb bird\u2026", "Don\u2019t turkey shame me!!  I\u2019ll eat a 13 lbs turkey myself if I want to!!!  /s", "Agreed. A quick search has 1 pound per person. \n\nNTA. That was really bad. There are so many ways to \"cover.\" Think it's not enough? Cook the large one the day before. Cook the small one while guests are there. Bury some reheated turkey on the bottom or dish it up on the plates of the ones who know. If you do it right, no one else will know. I mean who's going to look around and comment, \"Wow! You got that much turkey from a 13 pound bird? Just don't set our 4 legs. Sliced meat only and only the amount necessary. \n\nYou can easily hide cooked, sliced turkey in the 2 fully-stocked freezers and dispose of all the bones.", "Isn\u2019t being a glutinous pig kind of the whole fucking point of thanksgiving?
