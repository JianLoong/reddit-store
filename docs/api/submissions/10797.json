If you have really awful arthritis pain, an over-the-counter \\[OTC\\] painkiller like ibuprofen or paracetamol (Tylenol?) won't touch the sides of the pain.

I'm not home all day everyday, so I didn't know he continued to and he would put his roaches in the trash. Well, our baby fell asleep in the office. I thought it was fine, there's a pullout bed in there and it'll be easier than taking her to the nursery. The next morning, she wakes up at 8am. Completely lethargic. Unable to speak. Unable to walk or hold her balance. She will smile, but not respond to her name. I was so afraid. I also had no idea it was the medication she had somehow gotten into. There was no actual flower, no pieces, no edibles, in there the night I laid her down in the office, the only way it could have happened is by my husband throwing away a roach and her getting into the trash in there. I rushed her to ER not knowing anything about the ingesting or what was wrong. I thought my kid had brain damage, we put her through so many tests before they tested her urine and she tested positive for THC. I was livid and also so ashamed as a parent for letting that happen, cried all night non-stop praying she would go back to normal and I would have my baby back. We were in the hospital overnight to monitor here bc she basically passed out after all the tests the hospital gave her and wouldn't wake up til the next day in the early morning. \n\nThankfully, the hospital staff were really forgiving and didn't even call police, but they could have, they could have arrested us for neglect of our kids over this.

Of course. But that's not an excuse for child endangerment. Sure it's negligence rather then malice, but currently he's not being a safe parent to his kids.
