If she wanted to teach him a lesson...well done ! I hope he's learnt it. \n\nAll i said is what if she feels bad and doesn't want to fight with him, the path what she chose was clearly not the one. \nFlushing it down the toilet... You know it...she knows it..and i know it...you are obviously looking for a fight. So either intend to keep up that fight to teach him a lesson or keep it safe and then give it later when you feel he's learnt his lesson enough. \n\nYou think her husband's response would have been \" oh you flushed it ? Thank god. I learnt my lesson\" ?!\n\nOf course not. I completely side her for her reasons but not her actions ...that's all i mean", "Basic safety for their children also means she\u2019s closely watching them\u2026 which she isn\u2019t if this is a recurring problem and they\u2019re seconds away from eating dads edible. If she\u2019s a SAHM that\u2019s literally her whole job. Keeping the kids safe and watching them closely. I have a small child and know how quickly they can get into stuff IF YOU LET THEM or let them out of your sight. It\u2019s lazy parenting by both of them, not just him.", "Being married means being part of a team. It\u2019s not him vs her. It\u2019s THEM vs the problem. If this is a recurring issue then it\u2019s not hard to buy a locked box and solve the problem herself. She can even keep the key and give it to him like a child when he needs it if she\u2019s that concerned he won\u2019t use it. Trust me, he will.", "Definitely. Him leaving the edibles in reach was a HUGE no-no. My kids are older and I still keep my edibles out of reach and hidden in my room.", "I meant I had a rip-roaring panic attack, I was screaming and crying and could not breathe. It felt pretty bad to me\ud83d\ude02 That's why I said bad trip. Though yeah, that's not a term usually used with weed", "It is actually a hallucinogenic. It\u2019s just very mild and takes a lot to get to the point of like mushrooms and such. But taking too much edible at one can absolutely trigger hallucinations and violent vomiting. Ask me how I know \ud83d\ude05", "Exactly my point. They wouldn't have had any life threatening issues (I think) but if they had to go to the ER for any reason, and the healthcare workers ran a drug test, there would have been problems. A lot of them.", "i misread that part. she\u2019s still the AH\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f", "think i give af? lmao. constant ibuprofen isn\u2019t good for you either lmao. still the AH", "you\u2019re right he shouldn\u2019t leave it out. and imagine saying someone needs to be in pain to teach them a lesson. feel bad for ya my friend God bless", "ohhh good idea. what medicine do you prefer instead? painkillers? great healthy substitute!!", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23. probably think i\u2019m feeding kids weed lmao. what\u2019s my attitude towards minors?\ud83e\udd23", "dude, I\u2019m not fighting with you over this. have a good one!", "how is he risking their lives. and why would they bring them to a doctor to test? to take the father away from the kids? it\u2019s interesting how people still think this shit is true devils lettuce. he\u2019s gotta keep it better hidden FOR SURE. not even close to risking their lives lmao", "I don't agree. I believe she would have flushed any medicine down the toilet at that point after catching their children about to take it. I think it's firmly YTA. He forced her hand to keep the kids safe.", "I read your comment. I'm just amazed that you think your wife couldn't possibly react in a panicked way if she thought her children were in danger of being removed from her care and her husband be put in jail.", "I\u2019m not looking for a fight. Just honestly asking what the alternatives really are. How do you make someone realize they\u2019re putting they\u2019re family at risk when the refuse to realize it. I mean, maybe she shouldn\u2019t have flushed it but what should she have done. Moved it for him, again, told him again not to leave it out and prayed that next time she caught the kids before they ate it again? If he\u2019s leaving it out he\u2019s either a careless AH or using it for a lot more than pain relief.", "I don't believe you're a primary caregiver, tbh. It is impossible to NEVER LET THEM out of your sight unless you're locking them up when you do other necessary things. Like...do they stay in the bathroom with you when you have to use it? That's a couple minutes of easy eat the left-out edible time.", "Hopefully you're right.\nStill, he's an adult and if he keeps this behaviour up and refuses to even try seeing the problem he has to live with the consequences. She can't solve the issue for him. \nOP is very much NTA here.", "You\u2019re fine! I was just curious as I\u2019ve never witnessed someone refer to it that way. Some people definitely react poorly to weed and it\u2019s not necessarily for everyone.", "Yeah I once made brownies that were WAY too strong and was high, paranoid and hallucinating for days. Like anything, the poison is in the dose. And when you\u2019re dealing with small bodies who don\u2019t understand drugs it can go very badly, like anything else.", "\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I don\u2019t care that you think they\u2019re the asshole. \n\nShe didn\u2019t offer him only ibuprofen for the next year. Not that I agree with your dipshit opinion on pills anyway. But. She offered him one dose because he didn\u2019t have his weed. \n\nYou said you misread it; I was just saying that unless you want a bunch of comments like this one, maybe you should edit your comment so it isn\u2019t a massive fucking overreaction. Fucking Christ. Am i getting through to you at all? Probably not.", "He could've sent his own kids to the hospital. If OP hadn't walked in right then, that's what was going to happen\n\nBetter his kids life over his own, he's been warned multiple times\n\nAnd other pain medication was available", "Bruh nobody has an issue with him using weed to help his pain. The problem would be the same if he left oxys where is his literal children can reach them (well no, it'd be closer if he crushed the oxys and put them in a fucking cookie within the reach of kids). The issue isn't what the medication is, it's his refusal to take a modicum of responsibility over it and to protect his children", "No, more like you sound completely irresponsible", "you too!", ">how is he risking their lives.\n\nPeople can be allergic to pot, people can have SEVERE reactions to ingesting THC, especially for the first time, and need to be hospitalized for it.", "A full cookie is way too much for a grown ass adult. Imagine a four and six year old ingesting half a cookie each. That\u2019s going to bring on a lot of negative reactions for those kids, which will need medical intervention, and likely lead to their father getting into a ton of trouble.", "Again, we can agree to disagree. It\u2019s not that deep for me. As I told the person above me, it\u2019s my whole job to not let my son out of my sight and to keep him safe. When I go to the bathroom he\u2019s safely secure in his bounce seat. He\u2019s 8 months. He\u2019s very fast and very quick. I know better than to leave him to his own devices even for a minute. \n\nHer kids are a bit older. 4&6 can easily be kept in a playpen, we have one that\u2019s 71x59x26\u201d and if I had kids her ages they\u2019d be very safe in there and it\u2019s very secure for those moments you are in the bathroom or cooking dinner, etc. \n\nThey\u2019re a team. Marriage is supposed to be a team. It\u2019s supposed to be THEM vs whatever issue at hand not them against each other. Buying a locked box and making sure these things are kept safely away is a good solution to the problem. Not just showering OP with NTA and demonizing the father.", "We can agree to disagree. To me, it\u2019s ESH. As a parent of a small child I wouldn\u2019t dream of leaving him alone long enough to get into my weed or his fathers weed. If I have to go to the bathroom I put him safely in his bouncy seat where he can\u2019t get up. 4&6 can be safely put in an enclosed baby area with toys if she has to let them out of her sight. I\u2019m a SAHM myself right now, and it\u2019s literally my whole job to watch my son at all times and not let him hurt himself. \n\nMy husband and I do not leave out weed or weed paraphernalia out but we did buy a locked cupboard for these items and we also put it upstairs in another locked room. It\u2019s worked out wonderfully.", "We can agree to disagree. To me, it\u2019s ESH.

Lol. Good luck with that. Ridiculous.", "No, not agree to disagree, you're simply wrong because you haven't been there yet. My kids are 19, 15, and 13. I never had this particular issue, but I definitely know how fast they can disappear as will you when, you, know, they can walk, open doors, have enough social awareness to actively deceive you.", "If you really truly think you can just keep 4 and 6 year old kids in a playpen and they won't get out, oh boy. Have fun.", "Do you really think you can keep a 4 and 6 year old in a playpen? You are going to have a very rude awakening to parenting.", "Disagreeing is fine as long as it stays civil, which this very much did, so no problem :)\nThe difference to you and your husband is OP's husband not putting his stuff away despite being asked repeatedly imo. You guys are careful (which is pretty awesome), he is not ^^", "It was an adult dosage, taken by kids. That's just using your head\n\nIts his own fault, he needs consequences.", "All cookies are dosed to get adults high. Some are dosed to get adults ridiculously high. It's clear you don't have kids. As a pothead parent, this shit would NEVER happen under my roof. My husband has gotten lazy in the past leaving his pen around his bedroom and I have to nag his ass into submission real quick. Because with kids you never know when they are going to decide to get curious or invade what you think is \"your space\" they are too unpredictable. So as the ADULT you ensure certain precautions if you choose to be about that life. At the end of the day, if a kid gets ahold of weed the adult will always be the asshole.", "A child should not be eating any sort of cbd  cookie without a doctor prescribing it. These kids don\u2019t have a prescription, so even if it\u2019s a cbd cookie, it that does not make it okay.

The kids I\u2019ve watched 4-7 seem to love being in there. We have a ball pit, sensory board, literally all kinds of fun activities in there and none have complained. It\u2019s okay to agree to disagree or simply keep scrolling. No need to be rude.", "Absolutely and I agree with you. But I personally think that OP should be looking at solutions to the problem not just getting rid of dads medicine etc., I truly believe in finding solutions not just blaming the guilty party. I hope they find something that works for them. For us, keeping these items in a locked cupboard in another locked room has been awesome. Not everyone has that much space, but the locked cupboard or box is a cheap solution to this recurring issue.", "what\u2019s an \u201cadult dosage\u201d. cannabis is prescribed to young children by doctors. tell me what the \u201cadult dosage\u201d was? can you?", "when did i say it was ok for them to earth the fucking cookie or ingest weed. show me. and again until we know the dosage i\u2019m not listening to hospital bullshit", "Amen to that :)", "Yeah, I can\n\nThe cookie was meant for the adult husband-so an adult dosage was given\n\nStop being obtuse", "You're just choosing to play dumb at this point."]}
