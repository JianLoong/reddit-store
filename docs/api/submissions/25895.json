We hit up the beaches and had a great time. I took a lot of pictures at the beach, where, of course, L was wearing a swimsuit.\n\n\nA few days ago, my mother visited our house. I told her all about our trip to Cape Cod and how awesome and scenic it was. I pulled out my phone and I told mom that I was about to show her our beach pictures, but L began tugging at my arm and pleaded with me not to show any pictures of her in a swimsuit. She told me that it\u2019s about \u201cmy issues at school\u201d, and I immediately understood that she was having a flashback to when she was getting hounded by her evil teacher. I did my best to reassure her, however, and I let her know that it was all alright, and I showed mom the beach pictures anyway, including pictures of her in a swimsuit.

Big time and to a pretty horrific degree.\n\nYour daughter is fighting hard to take her self image back and you ignored her concerns.

Ugh.", "Her: *\"Dad this is triggering bad memories of me being sexually harassed by my teacher\"*\n\nYou: *\"Sucks to be you\"* Proceeds to share photos of her wearing minimal clothing anyway.\n\nYTA and a terrible parent.", "YTA. What a simple, straightforward request from your daughter, and instead you decide treat her like she has no say in who sees her body. Shame on you.", "YTA. Respect your daughter's boundaries.   You just retraumatized her.", "Of course YTA, why would you do that??? She was traumatized by that experience and didn't want you to show anyone her pics, why wouldn't you respect her wishes???", "Why do people find it so difficult to respect a simple request? As a parent,  you should want to respect your child and make her feel safe. By ignoring her request and dismissing her feelings,  you showed her that she can't trust you. Was showing off vacation pictures worth damaging your relationship with your daughter? YTA is", "YTA.\nYour daughter expressed a boundary and you stomped on it and did what you wanted anyway. You didn\u2019t have to show any pictures of her in a swimsuit, you could have shown ones she wasn\u2019t in, or was fully clothed in. You chose to do the exact thing she asked you not to do. What you did was horrible anyway, but the backstory makes it so much worse. She has trauma and PTSD tied into her feelings on this, and you STILL trampled over her boundary. You just reinforced the idea that something with which she has had no control over in the past, she still has no control over, because you deem it to be silly. You\u2019re the asshole big time.", "YTA she trusted you to have those pictures and to tell you she was uncomfortable and you completely disregard her feelings. She has trauma and you triggered the helpless feeling that she felt when she was being harassed. You\u2019re lucky if she ever lets you take a picture of her again and she\u2019ll probably never wear a bikini.", "YTA\n\nShe told you it wasn't okay. Then you (someone she trusts) got out your phone to show someone pictures of her that she absolutely did not want shared. Looking back, don't you think the sum of those parts could have made for a very upsetting reminder of what she went through?\n\nYou need to understand that you were wrong, apologize, admit wrongdoing to her, communicate that your intentions were not to do her any harm and *really listen to and take in everything she has to say*.", "\u2026 how do you even have to ask? Of course YTA - in what planet is your desire to show off vacation pics more important than your child\u2019s distress?

You shouldn't even take pictures of someone in a swimsuit on the beach without their permission, much less show these pictures to anyone.

It\u2019s clear she really does need it after that traumatic event. Second, she asked you one thing.

Does this really require any further explanation for you?", "YTA what part of \"please don't\" was so ducking difficult to understand?", "Another man your daughter should be able trust violates her comfort zone? What could go wrong? YTA.", "YTA. Your child did not consent for you to show her swimsuit photos to her grandmother. She has very legitimate issues surrounding this and instead of respecting her, just brushed her off. How is she supposed to feel safe around you if you ignore her like this.", "YTA - Omg! This is such a horrible violation. Shame on you.", "YTA. You\u2019re supposed to protect your daughter and instead you plowed over her boundaries and exploited her. It\u2019s sickening.", "YTA. I have no issue with you showing your mom the photos - but do it privately when L is not around so it doesn't cause her emotional distress.\n\nAnd, please get L into therapy ASAP", "YTA.

By removing her agency like you just did, that\u2019s exactly what you are.", "YTA-she asked you not to show the pictures because of the trauma she was subjected to. You ignored her request and showed them anyway.  How could you do that to your own child. You re-traumatized her and for what reason?  Why reason could you possibly have to do that to your child?", "YTA- No is a complete sentence. You completely disregarded her request.

The LAST thing your daughter needs right now is another person disrespecting her boundaries.", "Massive YTA.\n\nShe literally asked you not to show the pictures, you knew why, and it was related to a serious trauma that she experienced.", "Wow. Dude. YTA. As the father of a daughter myself, this post is sickening. You essentially just told her that her body is not hers to make decisions about, reinforcing what her teacher was doing to her. You'll be lucky to hear from her ever again after she turns 18.", "YTA. 100%   You're not a bad dad, but you made a big misstep that you can right. It would not have hurt you to wait on the pictures, and I'm sure grandma understands. \n\nUse this as an opportunity to apologize and talk privately with her, and ask her what she is looking for in terms of you and your wife's support.

His daughter set a clear, reasonable boundary, directly related to her trauma.  \n\nAbiding by the boundary would've cost nothing.

L clearly has some sorts of trauma and op just don't care", "Theirs a HUGE difference between showing embarrassing photos or stories and having your daughter go through a traumatizing event and begging you not to show photos of her in a swimsuit because it's fucking triggering her and causing painful flashbacks.\n\nShe BEGGED him to just skip the photos and he decided to make it clear that her mental health and clear triggers meant nothing and proceeded to continue the showcasing of photos. \n\nAssuring someone with words does nothing when your actions show your refusal to care.\n\nShe went through hell being sexually harassed by a former teacher and asking for photos not to be shared is a very SMALL request.\n\nExpressing a reasonable boundary isn't wrong. He chose to ignore a reasonable boundary because he could. And the fact he shows no remorse after hearing his kid CRYING shows a LOT about his character. To understand what his actions are doing (he admits he knows it was causing flashbacks and a possible PTSD episode ffs) and doing it otherwise makes him one of the worst kinds of parents out their. Just beyond a sorry excuse of a parent.\n\nThis wasn't some embarrassing story or baby photo. This was full of purposeful harm done towards his kid with full knowledge that he was doing it."]}
