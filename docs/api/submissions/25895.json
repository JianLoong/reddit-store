Can't you atleast listen to her pleas?\n\nYTA big time, infact biggest one I saw today.", "YTA that you really even have to ask the internet\u2019s opinion. Get a clue you waste of space. You are literally re-assaulting your precious daughter. What a complete tosser you are. I hope your daughter has a good support system.", "She specifically told you not to\u2026\n\nRespect her boundary\u2019s.\n\nYTA", "Let me rephrase your title.\n\n\"Am I the asshole for going against my daughter and making her relive something traumatic?\"\n\nDefinitely the ah here op. Go apologize to her and take her out for a treat", "YTA. What the fuck? It was a very simple request that you had absofuckinglutely no reason to deny. \n\nDelete the pics that have her in them. It\u2019s the very minimum you can do.", "Yta you had 0 reason to go against her wishes.", "YTA boundaries were not respected by her teacher, and you just proved that you also aren\u2019t a safe space and don\u2019t respect her boundaries which she clearly tried to set with you. \n\nMy eyes are tearing up just thinking about how hurt your poor teenage daughter would have been.", "YTA. Your daughter has PTSD and you just disrespected a simple boundary. The correct attitude would have been \u201cof course honey, do you want me to delete the pictures so you feel safer ?\u201d. Do better.", "Yes, YTA! \n\nYou knew she was flashing back and triggered and you flat out ignored HER NO. \n\nShe said no. \n\nAfter being sexually harassed and stalked. \n\nMajor asshole move toward your daughter. \n\nGood luck rebuilding that trust.", "YTA. Holy yikes dude. Daughter begged you not to and you completely disregarded her autonomy. Like damn at least wait until she isn\u2019t around and show your mom? This is so wild to me.", "YTA, and please hear me out. It may not seem like a big deal to you, and it probably wasn\u2019t a big deal to her before the events you mentioned, but what you did was damaging to a degree that can be difficult to understand if you aren\u2019t familiar with trauma like this. \n\nI\u2019d like to believe you\u2019re just na\u00efve, so I\u2019m going to explain to you why you are not only in the wrong here but may have actually done serious damage to L. \n\nVictims of sexual harassment or violence must work through the trauma of **having their boundaries ignored or dismissed by the aggressor, often in a way that makes them helpless or feel helpless to stop it.** \n\nYou obviously aren\u2019t the person who stalked and harassed her, so why does this matter? Because that\u2019s not how trauma works\u2014especially not from such recent harm.\n\nHere are some similarities to consider when thinking about why L was triggered:\n-you are a man in a position of power over her, and she trusts you\n-she showed that trust when she told you she was triggered and asked you not to do something that made her uncomfortable\n-instead of reassuring her by respecting her boundaries, you tried to reassure her by dismissing her concerns and boundaries\n\nIn other words, **you violated and dismissed her boundary in a way she was otherwise powerless to stop.** \n\nNow, she has to reconcile your response to her reasonable request with her image of you as a person she can trust. The two easiest ways are:\n1-\u201cMy request was unreasonable and I need to get over this\u201d which is a very dangerous mindset to have for hopefully obvious reasons\n2-\u201cI can\u2019t trust him anymore, so I need to be more careful around him to avoid getting hurt\u201d which is probably not how you want your daughter to feel about you\n\nEven ignoring the relevant trauma here, what you did was break her trust and ignore her feelings. The trauma just means that your mistake cost her a hell of a lot more than it would have otherwise.", "YTA when someone tells you something is traumatizing, you don't get to say \"no it's not\". god", "oh my god you\u2019re awful \ud83d\ude2d", "YTA 100% for all the reasons in the comments. I'm assuming your mother didn't try to stop this and is aware of the situation, so she's awful to.", "YTA for gods sake read up on trauma - you are probably grossly unaware of how lasting and deeply cutting these type of experiences are. She\u2019s not going to get better in a few weeks or even a year, she\u2019s not going to get better with your bizarre and cruel exposure therapy. Trauma stays with you for years. You\u2019ve made it worse. Please get yourself right so you can support your daughter.", "NICE. Thanks for showing her that her consent means nothing with YOU too. Good job. BIG YTA.", "YTA. You get like an A+ for that shit parenting tho. Bonus points for destroying your daughter's trust in you to that extreme and so blatantly too.", "YTA.\n\nI mean come on dude, she specifically told you it would trigger her ptsd, you knew it would trigger her ptsd, and you did it anyway. Get your shit together.\n\nGood luck fixing your relationship. You might never win her trust back, and you\u2019re going to need to accept that because you absolutely don\u2019t deserve it.", "Well shit, as long as you told her it was okay, you can do whatever you want with images of her. She doesn\u2019t get a say in it at all, does she? Property should be seen and not heard. \n\nI really don\u2019t understand how these guys go around fully thinking half the population isn\u2019t human.", "I\u2019m an old man and not prone to emotional responses but this one, this one made me tear up. As a father, I can\u2019t imagine doing as he did.", "**MEGA YTA**\n\nThis means that in every interaction you have ever had, you are TA due to this judgement spilling over. In every interaction you will ever have, you are TA. You have become Jung's ideal AH.", "This can't be real.", "YTA and it\u2019ll probably take a lot of work to get any trust from her again. By taking the action you did, you communicated to her that her boundaries mean nothing and you are not a safe person.", "YTA for betraying your daughter and being so monumentally disrespectful and dismissive.", "YTA - congratulations, you\u2019ve begun stripping away at the trust your child has in you. I hope you feel proud of yourself.", "If she has a problem with ppl seeing it why she wear it", "YTA. Your daughter was sexually harassed by a teacher and she is undoubtedly carrying trauma and clear body issues. She asks you to not show a picture of her wearing something that she obviously feels uncomfortable sharing and now another man smashes all over her boundaries and her autonomy. Only this time it's her own dad \ud83d\ude33How dare you! How dare you add to her trauma and how dare her gran not stand up to you either. You've both let her down massively and made things worse as she clearly can't trust you to keep her safe whilst she heals!", "Sorry but YTA, if she\u2019s going through a related traumatic event, then there\u2019s no reason for you not to respect her wishes, especially when it comes to something so private.", "YTA \n\nyour daughter was violated by someone who didn\u2019t respect her autonomy, and now you\u2019ve done the exact same thing to her. \n\nYou stolen a sense of safety for her that you\u2019ll be lucky to ever get back. You KNEW her request was related to her trauma, and yet you still purposefully did the thing that you knew would upset her", "YTA. \nHer: \u201cI really don\u2019t want you to show her those photos.\u201d \n\nYou: \u201clol get wrecked.\u201d", "YTAYTAYTAYTAYTA", "It\u2019s crazy you can write this and not know YTA. You essentially told her she doesn\u2019t have a right to her own body by showing her in a swimsuit when she asked you not to. It\u2019s her body. She didn\u2019t give you consent and you dismissed her. Was it worth losing your relationship with your daughter? You scarred her for life and made her relive something traumatic. She needs therapy and a better dad.", "YTA she clearly told you not to. You ignored her boundaries and took away her autonomy and power over images of her own body.", "I often wish that people must take 3 years of therapy before having kids...\nAND be evaluated afterwards...\n\nIt does sound like an intrusion into human rights, but damn, it would help\n\nYTA", "YTA. Good grief. \n\nYOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT IS BEST FOR HER. Hire a professional to help your daughter and listen to him or her.", "The grandmother sucks too, as it doesn't seem like she stood up for her granddaughter.", "This \ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5", "I don't disagree with you but it sounds like it was a couple of photos in the middle of all of the vacation photos. I'm sure OP could have glossed over them while still showing his Mom the other photos."]}
