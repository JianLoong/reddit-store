We still live in our childhood home. My sister co-owns it with our mom and I had moved out but it became too expensive. I'm currently living in the nursery. All the baby seems to do is scream and cry. I'm not even sure she actually ever sleeps. My sister says the baby has colic but it doesn't really seem like she's doing anything about it. Tonight the baby cried for 3 straight hours, 11pm-2am. I was supposed to work at 7am today, up at 5am, but because the baby kept screaming I haven't slept so I called and left a message calling out. \n\nAfter listening to the baby cry for 3 hours, including right outside my door while my sister walked around the hall with the baby I went to her room and begged her to get the baby to quiet down. My sister was laying on the bed with her eyes closed while the baby laid in the crib screaming. She burst into tears and told me if I had any suggestions to feel free to make them because she had tried everything. I remarked that obviously she hadn't because the baby was still crying and I didn't think her laying there letting the baby cry was going to do anything. My sister just got more upset and yelled at me to fuck off. Then our mom woke up and got involved and told me to go to my room.\n\nThe baby has finally stopped crying and I heard my sister complaining about me to mom through the wall.\n\nI wasn't trying to hurt her feelings, I was just desperate for the baby stop stop crying. In the two weeks she came home from the hospital I haven't had a single night of sleep and it's starting to take it's toll. I've never been around babies before so this is all new to me, my sister works with babies as a nanny. \n\nAm I an asshole?", "created_utc": 1677143062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/119t6xq/aita_for_asking_my_sister_if_she_could_stop_her/", "score": 1311, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are absolutely the only person desperate for the baby to stop crying.\n\n>In the two weeks she came home from the hospital I haven't had a single night of sleep and it's starting to take it's toll.\n\nYou poor thing! I can only imagine how much this must be affecting you and only you. Because you are the only person in the house who needs sleep. Your sister's experience as a nanny has taught her everything she needs to know about parenting, and she absolutely adores the sounds of her sweet child screaming it's head off at all hours of the night.\n\nUgh, YTA. On behalf of your sister, fuck off.\n\nDon't like it? Get out of her house.", "YTA. Your sister is physically recovering from having a baby. Her hormones are everywhere, her body is healing from a trauma, she\u2019s feeding another human, and she\u2019s not sleeping. As tired as you feel, I can promise you it\u2019s significantly worse for her. You said she hasn\u2019t tried anything, but the baby woke you up when she was walking in the hallway. It sounds like she\u2019s trying everything she can.\n\nSometimes you just need a moment to collect yourself. Which again sounds like your sister was doing when she laid down. Would you prefer her to keep walking around and collapse while holding the baby? Instead of judging her and being an ass, why don\u2019t you help her? If you haven\u2019t been around babies before, congratulations you are now. Time to learn how to take care of a tiny human. If you can\u2019t do that, then take care of your sister. Make sure she\u2019s eating, do the laundry, run errands for her, do the housework, or give her five minutes to take a shower.", "YTA. I've got an idea though. \n\n1. Tell your sister how to stop the baby from crying. Even though she's a nanny, she's useless without your help. \n2. Publish your techniques. You'll become fabulously wealthy very quickly as no-one else has been able to solve this problem yet. \n3. Use your wealth to buy your own home so that you don't have to live in someone else's.", "Of course YTA. Babies can't be magically turned off- especially if it has colic, which is intensely painful for them. Sleep on the couch, offer a bit of help, or move out.", "YTA \n\nA two week old baby has one way to communicate and it\u2019s too cry! That\u2019s all\n\nI suggest buying ear plugs and a white noise app", "YTA.\n\nWow what a selfish *****\n\nSo your living in your sisters house in her babies nursery and you have the absolute audacity to tell her to get her 2 WEEK OLD to shut up. You absolutely made that situation worse. Do you think your sister enjoys listening to a screaming child when she just gave birth hasn't slept is running on fumes and has her mooch complaining it's still not enough?\n\nJesus go to the sofa or get some headphones.\n\nEver heard the phrase beggars can't be choosers", "Oh look, someone not knowing anything about infants making demands of a new parent without making even the slightest effort to understand what was going on. How unsurprising.\n\nYTA. Maaaaassively so.", "YTA. Is it me or are there more and more people here who don't understand how basic human stuff works. \n\nDad doesn't want to be present at birth \"cause babies  remember fuck all anyway\", now you looking for a Killswitch on a baby. If you want to stay at her place and you know a baby is on the way, you read up on things, to learn and you help out and don't add extra stress to the mother. What is this \"I don't like babies\", anyway? You behave like one.", "YTA. Colic is complicated. Sometimes it's indigestion, but studies have shown that sometimes it's a migraine-like neurological distress. \nBy the time you walked in and saw your sister with her eyes shut, she had already exhausted her options and needed to take a moment to breathe. Colic is one of the biggest reasons shaken baby syndrome is a thing, and the fact your sister is choosing to center herself instead of losing patience is a *GOOD* thing. \nSpeaking as a mom of three - two of them being twins - this won't last forever. I know it's hard to listen to, but it's even harder for your sister to learn how to be a mother without you being a judgemental jerk. \nHighly recommend noise cancelling headphones. They're a lifesaver. Also, you should really make it up to your sister by cooking meals occasionally, or doing laundry for her and the baby. The best way you can show her love and support is by doing whatever you already know how to do, since infant care isn't on your list of skills (that's ok, by the way).", "YTA.  As much as it annoys you now, imagine if it had to suck on your boobs every couple hours and still kept on crying.", "As a mom to a 7 week old baby, YTA. Babies cry. Sometimes they cry for no reason. Sometimes they cry no matter what you do. Sometimes, for everyone's safety, you have to put them down for a minute and breathe. \n\nYou want sleep? So does your sister. If you're not going to help her or move out, the least you can do is not make it worse for her.", "YTA, it\u2019s her house, don\u2019t like it? Move out! You clearly have no idea how hard babies are! You think you\u2019re suffering? How do you think your poor sister feels? My baby was the same and there is literally nothing she can do to stop it, it just eats away at you, it\u2019s so draining I get that but she just went through the physical side of birth and the hormone drop, she\u2019s also the main caregiver so magnify your frustrations by about a million and that\u2019s how your sister is feeling.", "YTA. My son had colic for a hellish six weeks, and 25 years later, I can still hear those screams. There's nothing to do for it, no cure or treatment that will stop it. We walked endless miles with my son, rubbed his back, rocked him, swayed with him, sang to him... none of it made a difference. There were times when I cried right along with him, and times when I had to lay him down and walk away because my nerves were so frayed I had no clue what else to do. And I had a supportive mom who used to come in after a full day in the office and go straight for me to relieve me! I don't even want to think about how much more terrible it would have been had she started in bitching to me the way you did to your sister...\n\nAs desperate as you are for the baby to stop crying, I can assure that your sister is much more so. Being only two weeks postpartum, she's dealing with the aftereffects of birth (both hormonal and physical) along with the colic. Her child is screaming like they're in pain, she's undoubtedly doubting herself and her skills as a mother, and your attitude and remarks aren't helping. She needs support that she isn't getting from you, and if you can't offer that, the least you can do is stay out of the way and not jump on her. For now, everyone in the house should be obeying the number one rule of baby care: When the baby sleeps, if at all humanly possible, you sleep. That may mean three-hour stretches, but three hours is better than none at all.", "Dude. I don\u2019t wanna hate on you (no really!) - but please - Google a thing or two before you tell at your sister and/or post such stuff. I mean you\u2019re literally on Reddit - how can you not post this on one of the subs here!????\n\nBabies cry. Period. And if anything, I have sympathy for your sister because this is a BRAND NEW baby, that she doesn\u2019t fully know the signals and symptoms of. It takes a while to parent until you recognize signs of meltdowns and problems and crying and hunger and tiredness and pain and etc etc in your own child. Contrary to popular belief, this stuff does NOT come with any kind of an instruction manual\n\nPlease. At 23M, you\u2019re frankly too old to not be able to either help your sister, at least with not complaining as a low bar - or googling this shit so at least you don\u2019t blame her for what is so completely out of her control\n\nI don\u2019t wanna call you an AH but you\u2019re def a bit clueless", "YTA, a baby is not a machine with an off button. I can understand if she feels bad or maybe even inadequete as a mother for not getting her baby to be quiet. She doesn't need someone complaining about that right now, she needs someone to help her", "You\u2019re desperate for the crying to stop? Imagine how she feels!! YTA she literally burst into tears and you still think you\u2019re possibly in the right here?", "That's a new born they cry, that's what they do, no baby is laughing or is quite all the time \n\nYTA", "YTA causing extra tension in the house is what is making the baby cry so much. Try helping out and bonding with the little thing.", "YTA...a massive, gaping AH", "Yes YTA. Move out if you can't deal with it. Babies cry. Your sister can only do so much. Educate yourself regarding colicky babies.", "YTA. Babies cry alot. I once had a friend visit me and my baby was crying, I went through every need they can have and nothing worked. She asked me what I do now. Start again. \nYou just... Start again. But sometimes it drives you insane and you need a moment. If the baby is safe and crying, that's ok. There is advice that if your getting too overwhelmed, to put the baby in their cot and walk away for a bit. \nNext time, your up already, try to help settle the baby. If it doesn't work, you will get some understanding of how it is and how at times you can be doing all the right things but the baby cries.", "YTA. You make it sounds like your sister is lazy and just love listening at her crying baby. Jeez!", "YTA. Why don't you pick the baby up and make it stop crying if you think it's so easy? What a jerk. Imagine looking at your burnt out and exhausted sister trying to take care of a baby and making it about yourself. The poor girl just went through one of the most physically painful and demanding experiences of her life and all you care about is yourself. It's her home. She doesn't have to answer to you. If you hate it so much then gtfo and rent somewhere else. She was probably laying in bed because she hasn't slept for days and she couldn't take it anymore. You're a dick and a horrible brother.\n\" In the two weeks she came home from the hospital I haven't had a single night of sleep and it's starting to take it's toll\"\nYou're right. You're the victim here. You're the one really struggling. \n\"I've never been around babies before so this is all new to me\"\nCongratulations now you know that they cry. Dick.", "YTA\n\nYou think your sister doesn't want baby to stop crying? Either man up, or shut up.", "YTA. The baby is 2 weeks old. You think your sister wants her baby to cry? \n\nAlso she co-owns the damn house. If you have a problem living there you are free to move out.", "You should look up colic, OP - I know you're frustrated, but it's very, very unlikely that your sister is doing something wrong; some newborns really are just like that, and there is *nothing* you can do about it.  Some babies really do just scream for no reason that anyone can determine.\n\nI do have some sympathy, because you're stressed and sleep deprived, but YTA.", "YTA\n\nWhat do you suggest she do? Tape the baby\u2019s mouth shut? This is just how raising a baby goes.", "It's a bit of a shock, isn't it. Suddenly you go from a world where people can be reasoned with to a situation where there is nothing you can do to stop a colicky baby from crying. It's very difficult.\n\nI want to tell you you're not an AH because you're sleep deprived and everyone has the right to be a bit unreasonable when they haven't slept, but I'm afraid YTA, if only softly, because your poor sister is dealing with a colicky baby and doesn't need you moaning as well.\n\nI have never met her and I know nothing about her except what you've written but I promise you that if she could stop the baby from crying she would. This is not her being lazy, it's a baby being a baby.", "YTA\n\nColicky babis are in pain and just cry. There's not much you can do about it. Instead of asking your sister what you can do to help her, you know like she's helping you by letting you live in her home when you can't afford your own place, you guilt trip her and make her feel horrible, thinking only about yourself.", "YTA - babies, especially newborn babies, are ridiculously difficult to settle. Some may sleep through the night but most will struggle to calm. Your sister is a nanny but this is HER baby and she may be struggling because not only is HER baby poorly but all of her training as a nanny might not be helping. So no, she can't just 'stop her child from screaming' because it's not just a child, it's a sick newborn.\n\nI'm not sure if there is a father in the picture but being a new mother can be a very isolating, scary situation if your support network is nonexistent or barely existent. I know she has you and your mother but she also has loads of hormones still raging throughout her postpartum body. She is clearly struggling as she was lying in her bed with her eyes closed - not because she was trying to sleep but probably to ground herself or calm herself before she acts on emotion. I imagine she's using all of her energy to care for her baby and doing so can take such a toll on the physical, mental and emotional wellbeing of a parent.\n\nHowever, I do understand your frustration because I know how hard it is to sleep with this noise in the background. Have you tried earplugs, white noise machines, listening to podcasts via headphones, etc...?\n\nIf anything, I would probably start saving up money to move out, cause disrupted sleep patterns will continue for at least 5 years.", "So she owns the house with your mom and is letting you stay there (are you paying anything?) and you\u2019re gonna give her shit two weeks after having a baby?!? YTA and a giant one at that. She\u2019s clearly struggling and going through a lot and needs help and support. She\u2019s obviously not getting any sleep either. You need to move out and grow the fuck up.", "YTA. How do you think she feels with the same thing happening AND she's healing from having the baby!!? Some babies get colic, there's nothing you can do about it except try to comfort them and let it run its course. She can try a warm bath, some gripe water, or Humphreys 3's (have to ask the pharmacist for the Humphreys) but there's no guarantee any of it will help. Good luck to your sister.", "I would say yes. YTA. This is a baby, not a thing you can plug out or make it stop. I can understand that it is frustrating for you because you need your sleep and have to work early. But this baby is two weeks old and it\u2019s also new for your sister to have a baby. Of course it\u2019s hard especially in the beginning. Also with the baby having colic.\nTry to be more understanding and maybe help out your sister a little bit if you have time. Or move out or something. But don\u2019t blame your sister and her baby for your frustration. They can\u2019t do much more right now and I\u2019m sure she\u2019s trying her best.", "YTA, this baby is weeks old and you are blaming your sister for them crying. They have no other way to communicate. Your sister has never been a mum before, she's 2 weeks into an entirely new world, and you've decided to berate her for not being good enough at it, like she isn't more tired than you. You've missed a bit of sleep. She's missed all the sleep you have + growing this child for 9 months + had to push the child out or had major surgery for her to come out. You are every new mother's worst nightmare.\n\nLook into newborn development and see what you can do to support her so you can both get a bit of sleep.", "You've asked the question, and have been given a resounding answer, but you don't like it because it's not what you want.

Easy solution.", "YTA\n\nYou keep asking how the baby is going to stop screaming if your sister is just laying there.\n\nThe answer is: it's not. The baby will scream no matter what your sister is doing, she could try to feed it, change it, sing to it, scream at it, do the boogie while dressed as John Wayne, *nothing* is going to stop the screaming short of killing the kid.\n\nThere's a reason that otherwise loving, competent parents will sometimes shake their infants so hard, that they get brain damaged, and this is one of the main factors. \n\nSo if you think you're desperate imagine how your sister feels, when she has to deal with you, acting like some \"know it all\"-asshole on top of it.", "YTA. I had to touch up on my knowledge of colic just now (to see if there's anything new on it) and I suggest you do the same.  I couldn't imagine being a mother or anyone in that situation. You'd be surprised how many parents risk shaking their baby because of it.  \n\nYou aren't the only one suffering from this. I suggest reading the article on kids health about it. Maybe you can tag team and try some of these to help. I know it's not your baby and responsibility but it's also not the babys fault for us having no solid solutions for this. The fact that you can't move out, helping out is better than breaking down your sister. Shes already probably feeling like she's failing and a bad mother.  Just cut her some slack.", "YTA. \n\nIf you can\u2019t handle the crying baby, move out. It\u2019s not your house, and it sounds like you\u2019re living on their charity and goodwill. \n\nNew baby\u2019s are hard. Baby\u2019s with colic are just next level to that. It\u2019s not as simple as \u201cOh, I\u2019ll just do X, Y, and Z\u201d and the baby will stop crying.

But you might want to start making plans to find some other room-mates to live with, hopefully you can afford it!", "Soft YTA working with babies as a nanny is different than having your own; your sister is still physically recovering from the birth and is also dealing with all the hormonal changes that come with Baby Here. Take your stress about not getting enough sleep, add on the stress and worry of \"my baby is sick\" and all the things I mentioned previously, and that's where your sister's at.

We still live in our childhood home. My sister co-owns it with our mom and I had moved out but it became too expensive. I'm currently living in the nursery. All the baby seems to do is scream and cry. I'm not even sure she actually ever sleeps. My sister says the baby has colic but it doesn't really seem like she's doing anything about it. Tonight the baby cried for 3 straight hours, 11pm-2am. I was supposed to work at 7am today, up at 5am, but because the baby kept screaming I haven't slept so I called and left a message calling out. \n\nAfter listening to the baby cry for 3 hours, including right outside my door while my sister walked around the hall with the baby I went to her room and begged her to get the baby to quiet down. My sister was laying on the bed with her eyes closed while the baby laid in the crib screaming. She burst into tears and told me if I had any suggestions to feel free to make them because she had tried everything. I remarked that obviously she hadn't because the baby was still crying and I didn't think her laying there letting the baby cry was going to do anything. My sister just got more upset and yelled at me to fuck off. Then our mom woke up and got involved and told me to go to my room.\n\nThe baby has finally stopped crying and I heard my sister complaining about me to mom through the wall.\n\nI wasn't trying to hurt her feelings, I was just desperate for the baby stop stop crying. In the two weeks she came home from the hospital I haven't had a single night of sleep and it's starting to take it's toll. I've never been around babies before so this is all new to me, my sister works with babies as a nanny. \n\nAm I an asshole?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You\u2019re getting a roasting here, so I thought I\u2019d offer some advice on helping your sister & the baby. FYI I had premie twins with reflux and colic.\n\nIt\u2019s worth getting some medical device on if it is colic or reflux. If it\u2019s reflux, keeping the baby on a slight tilt will help keep the acid down (so not horizontal), eg lie the baby on your chest when you\u2019re slightly propped up in bed with a pillow. Obv taking care to support the baby\u2019s neck, she can\u2019t support her head yet.\n\nThere is medication that can ease colic, worth trying.\n\nIf your sister is breast feeding she may want to try excluding certain foods. Sadly for me, if I ate chocolate it made the colic worse, a cruel twist of fate. If she\u2019s bottle feeding, look into dairy intolerance, we tried soya milk (didn\u2019t work for us). Ask the baby\u2019s doctor/healthcare person about the above suggestions.\n\nHelp your sister out - a stressed and depressed mother will lead to a stressed and miserable baby\u2026 \n\nIf all else fails, prep for the nightly scream-a-thon.

Your sisters body is recovering from birthing that child. Imagine how exhausted every single system in her body is! \n\nI put yta, but really, I think you're just uneducated in the infant department. It may be helpful if you once in while step in and walk/rock the baby. The baby can sense the tension, and your sister would be so grateful for the help. \n\nSome tips if it is gas causing the crying \n- keep baby upright while walking around, doing a gentle up and down bounce ( you may get barfed on).\n-give a gentle belly massage moving in small circles from right to left.\n-warm baths.\n-prop baby up so they are laying on their left side ( do not leave the baby unattended in this position).\n- lay baby on their back, bend their knees gently push them up  near the belly, and make slow circular movements.\n\nIf the baby is breastfed, your sister should track what she's eating herself, something could be upsetting the babies stomach. If she is fed formula, she might need a different kind.", "YTA. \n\nyou need to read up on colicky babies. I also can\u2019t stand the sound of a baby crying but colic is a whole other ballgame.

I was so exhausted but I remember being up on a school night til 12am walking my poor little niece around trying to soothe her. No one likes hearing a baby crying -- least of all her mother.

Instead of being an AH about it then you could have offered to hold the baby and soothe them for a few minutes whilst your sister took that time out so she could try again.

I pity anyone you marry.", "Let me explain:\n\n* babies cannot tell us what they need, they can only cry and we can only guess and do trial and error\n* a baby may cry because they are hungry - if they still cry after feeding, or if they refuse to feed, they are not hungry and feeding them won\u2019t make them stop crying\n* a baby may cry because they are tired - if they cry after having had enough sleep or if they cannot fall asleep, then you cannot make them stop crying by trying to make them sleep (note that walking up and down with a baby is a quite successful method when it comes to making them sleep - ovbiously your sister was doing that and obviously it did not work)\n* a baby may cry because they want physical contact, want to be held (see above, your sister was holding the baby and walking up and down for hours - it did not work)\n* a baby may cry because they are in pain - but unless they have a foolproof reason to believe they are in pain (e.g. a wound, a previous operation that they are healing from) you cannot go give them pain meds because they have very new and fragile bodies and we are not doctors and we do not even know what\u2019s wrong. Some babies struggle with hurting tummies - we call that colic.\n* a baby may cry because the world outside the womb is so very different and frankly way more exhausting and irritating than the world in the womb that they were used to: there is light and weird noises, and there is gravity, and they have to breathe and to digest food, and they may feel cold or they may dislike feeling clothes on their skin, and they miss hearing mum\u2019s heartbeat and miss the constant energy coming through the cord and the darkness and the warmth and the floating in water, in short a bay may cry because they are missing the womb, and there is nothing you can do about it really, but some babies really struggle with that adjustment, and we call that colic, too.\n\nNow, why did your sister put the baby down in the crib?
