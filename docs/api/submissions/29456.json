She never made trips to see him, never offered financial support, never got involved in his medical care/medical power of attorney, nothing.\n\nAunt married a very stereotypical 'neck-beard'; overweight, no job, doesn't contribute to house chores, has more steam hours than I do somehow, and really doesn't parent his kids whatsoever. He was a lot more fun to be around when I was a kid because I didn't realize how immature he was. Whenever they come to family functions aunt usually tells me (never asks) that I am now watching her kids while she hangs out with cousins, which I was probably going to do anyways because I do enjoy hanging out with my younger cousins.\n\nRecently, she had complications with a very safe non-life threatening condition and had to go back to the hospital. This means step uncle has to watch his kids by himself because she's recovering.
