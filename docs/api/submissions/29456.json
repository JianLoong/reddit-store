She never made trips to see him, never offered financial support, never got involved in his medical care/medical power of attorney, nothing.\n\nAunt married a very stereotypical 'neck-beard'; overweight, no job, doesn't contribute to house chores, has more steam hours than I do somehow, and really doesn't parent his kids whatsoever. He was a lot more fun to be around when I was a kid because I didn't realize how immature he was. Whenever they come to family functions aunt usually tells me (never asks) that I am now watching her kids while she hangs out with cousins, which I was probably going to do anyways because I do enjoy hanging out with my younger cousins.\n\nRecently, she had complications with a very safe non-life threatening condition and had to go back to the hospital. This means step uncle has to watch his kids by himself because she's recovering. My parents are out of town and he keeps sending me videos of all three of them (2f, 7m, 11f) misbehaving inside the hospital, climbing on furniture, saying stuff like \"really need some help right now lol\", or \"I don't know what to do haha.\" I have a pretty mean concussion right now, so I really don't want to leave my house or do anything for that matter. Extended family keeps telling me that I should go help because \"I'm the closest\", but I live two hours away and really haven't ever driven that far before. AITA for saying no?\n\nEDIT: blocked grandmother who keeps asking me to help and stopped being on my phone up until now, thanks for all the advice.

I think you should let Auntie Lazy rest and recover while you, Uncle Neckbeard, take the kids home to unwind! I have to turn my phone off and rest my head per doctors orders, so I won\u2019t be able to text anymore. Good night!\u201d", "NTA..And \"NO\" is a *complete sentence*!", "You're underage, you have a CONCUSSION, you can't drive with a concussion, you're two hours away, he's an adult, he's a step uncle? Is your mom and aunt step siblings? Your mom and your aunt don't even like each other. Why are these harassing someone with a TBI? \n\nWtf is wrong with people. NTA.", "NTA. He\u2019s a grown ass man who should be taking care of the kids.", "NTA. Reply back - Sorry, I can\u2019t help you. I am home sick with a concussion. \nYou really shouldn\u2019t be driving while you have that headache anyway. \nTell the extended family, Thank you for your concern about my health. I can\u2019t go. Leave me out of the reply thread.", "NTA.", "Not your monkeys not your circus.", "NTA - you are just a teenager yourself and you are absolutely not responsible for your aunt\u2019s kids when their father is able bodied and can take care of them but just doesn\u2019t want to!!", "NTA - Concussion or not, they are his children, he's a full grown adult and should parent them. If he's unable to parent them, that isn't your problem.", "You don\u2019t have to have an excuse to be able to say no. Your step uncle\u2019s circus act isn\u2019t your responsibility. It\u2019s good you said no and didn\u2019t go. Boundaries and fences are made for good living. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Like, you\u2019re 17, don\u2019t you have school or something?", "How is someone a step-uncle? Was this your mom\u2019s step sister\u2019s husband?", "NTA. You have a concussion. It\u2019s not safe for you to drive 2 hours to deal with some noisy, obnoxious kids who aren\u2019t use. (Not blaming the kids here.)", "Good lord, NTA. Even without a concussion. It's his responsibility, not yours. He's being immature and my guess is sexist by trying to foist them on you.\n\n(But small point, his weight and facial hair have nothing to do with his deficiencies. You don't want to casually insult people who are overweight among your readers.)", "NTA x 1000.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want someone who had a concussion watching my kids, first of all. That doesn\u2019t sound like an appropriate carer.\n\nEven if you didn\u2019t have a concussion, your uncle would still be a dick for expecting this of you. Parent your own children, sir.\n\nI hope you begin to feel better soon and that these jerks back off now you\u2019ve stood your ground.", "NTA", "NTA, sorry, fam, I can\u2019t, doc\u2019s orders cause of a concussion.", "What the hell is a step uncle?", "the fact that you have a concussion and they're expecting you to drive two hours is absolutely WILD and completely unsafe without even mentioning the fact that you've never driven for that long before.\n\nyou are so NTA hun. good for you for standing up for yourself.", "NTA. What a useless man. If he wants to create children he can take care of them", "NTA!\n\nThis guy is unwilling to care for, supervise, and corral his own kids, so he chose to harass a minor with a concussion who is relatively new to driving to drive TWO HOURS to do so for him?! He's irresponsible and unrealistic, and apparently so are your other relatives. Feel free to ignore this.", "NTA you have a CONCUSSION omg expecting a 17 year old with a concussion to drive 2 hours to help a grown man take care of his children is insane.", "Honestly, driving there yourself, or even riding 2 hours while someone else drives you to their house, could result is dizziness, nausea/vomiting, headaches and even passing out. Any of those  symptoms would require bedrest, which you cannot get if you\u2019re babysitting 3 kids-one of which is a toddler. \n\nAren\u2019t you still in school yourself? Why does your family think you\u2019re the only person that can help? \n\nNTA.", "NTA. i dont even need to read the rest. NOT your kids NOT your problem. not your circus not your monkeys.\n\nedit: read it now, block the uncle. you wont lose anything in life dropping that dead weight.", "Nta. If you have a concussion you should be careful driving, and certainly not that far. You also need rest and to not be around loud children. Tell your family to take care of their own damn children.", "NTA and please stop watching the kids when they come over.  Go visit a friend for a couple of hours if you have to.  It\u2019s time their sperm donor actually became a parent.", "NTA.\n\nLiterally none of the backstory is relevant. They're his kids and his responsibility.\n\nHaving said that you should not be driving with a concussion.", "Why are the kids at the hospital? \n\nThe dad should take them home. \n\nAnd your family wants you to help out someone while they are in the hospital, while you yourself have a medical condition that requires you to rest, and not have too much stimulation? \n\nThat is just disregarding your own health and safety for their convineance. \n\nNTA", "NTA. He\u2019s a grown ass man who should be taking care of the kids.", "NTA, enjoy your video games and hope you feel better!", "NTA. Uncle Neckbeard can tend to his own kids.", "NTA - you are not responsible in this situation, the Dad is. Your family seems a bit misogynistic in thinking you need to step up.", "You have a concussion!  You shouldn\u2019t be driving or taking care of rowdy kids!  He can take care of his own kids or pay a babysitter.", "You can't babysit.  Dr.'s orders.  You need peace and quiet or you can have bad consequences.  Might that shut them up?", "NTA. I\u2019ve had 2 concussions and no. I drove after my second one and it\u2019s a miracle I didn\u2019t hurt myself or others. Drove in a complete haze. Driving in general with a concussion is not safe. Not to mention light and noise sensitivity. Rest and get better. If you don\u2019t nurture that type of injury you may regret it. Take it from Migrain McGee.\ud83d\ude42", "NTA, wow, they are huge AH\"s, hope you've told your parents what they've been up to. Stand your ground. I hope you feel better soon.", "Yep. He's the father but somehow the 17YO is better equipped to deal with 3 kids??? I call BS. And agree that 2 hours isn't really all that close. Plus it doesn't sound like there was an end date; just come babysit until not needed anymore.", "This is what I was thinking. I've had more than a few concussions, driving while concussed is dangerous. Also headaches and blurred vision can sometimes come and go. (At least for the times I was knocked unconscious it did) A two hour drive and then trying to monitor 3 young children and possibly a 2 hour drive home in the dark is a super big ask. Pass on that mess. \n\nNTA - Aunt needs to realize her husband is useless as a guardian for the children and find them a professional babysitter, and OP needs to begin refusing to monitor her children at family functions simply because now they feel entitled to her services.", "I agree, it\u2019s that those two things feed into how he does/doesn\u2019t take care of himself. Doesn\u2019t work out, doesn\u2019t shave, etc. not that those things make him \u201cnot take care of himself\u201d, they\u2019re just products of it. When I met him he was a healthy weight and ever since getting a wife gained a ton by doing nothing.", "had a first uncle that wasn't blood to me but was family, aunt divorced him and married another guy, neckbeard. I usually call him by his first name or step-uncle in private to differentiate. Much closer to the first uncle.", "I'm confused by how he's a step uncle, are the kids not his? Because it sounds like OP's mom is the aunt's bio sister, or at least half sister since they have the same dad. So someone married to OP's bio aunt is just her uncle, no step about that", "Not quite the closest.  Step uncle is closer and is a actual parental adult. Just a lazy one apparently.", "There's the whole concussion issue as well. OP shouldn't be doing anything right now, especially not a long drive followed by taking care of children. That's asking for an accident or brain damage!", "Definitely wasn\u2019t the intention to leave me alone, both parents had work trips around this time and couldn\u2019t get out of it. Not my first round of brain injury and the first 24 hrs were manageable, so I said I was ok on my own.", "Don't worry, my mum DNA is worried too. OP should be being supervised NOT SUPERVISING OTHERS and certainly not driving.", "Wait. You have a concussion...and you're alone??\n\nYou shouldn't be alone. Wherever your parents are, they should be flying back to you.", "Ignore everyone contactin you. Block them if you need to. Send your parents a text asking them to contact you asap. Tell you parents what's happening and let them deal with everyone else (hopefully your parents go scorched earth on them.)", "We call him step uncle because aunt had a two kids a long time ago and they got divorced, new guy (step uncle neckbeard) is her new husband. Really only talk to old/bio uncle now. I either call him step uncle or his real name.", "> Not my first round of brain injury\n\nAnd you're 17?\n\nYou have heard that repeated brain injuries can have serious consequences later in life? Whatever the hell you're doing to keep being injured, you need to stop.", "I've had a concussion due to a scootering accident in my 20's.  Those are no joke.  Tell Uncle Neckbeard and his Fabulous Flying Monkeys that if you give in, you'll likely end up in the hospital next to your aunt or in the morgue.", "Send him some medical information on concussion phrased so a 10 year old can read it.   Then forward same to all the pests in family.  Then turn off phone and rest your hurting brain.", "It was very last minute, both were out for work and one is coming back tonight and the other on Tuesday. My college friends were hanging with me today at my house and played cards with me. I\u2019m only alone yesterday and tonight.", "I appreciate the concern, I\u2019m involved with a lot of athletics and it tends to happen with the sport I play. This is the second time I\u2019ve had it happen and I\u2019ve learned to take it easy afterwards and tell others no headshots.", "audiobooks.", "You need to be more concerned about the head injuries.  I get that young people never think terrible things can happen to them, but they can.  Brain damage, intercranial hemorrhage, and aneurysms are not a joke, and repetitive head trauma increases the risk exponentially every time it happens.  You don\u2019t want to go take a nap one day because you have a headache and wind up in a vegetative state.", "Have you heard of [CTE](https://www.alz.org/alzheimers-dementia/what-is-dementia/related_conditions/chronic-traumatic-encephalopathy)?\n\nWhat is happening to you now could result in that later."]}
