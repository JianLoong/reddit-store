You had one condition and they broke it. The good thing is that they have a couple of months until another bill is due so they can take that time to figure out how to pay for their car. Also, $700 is kind of a lot for a vehicle so maybe they need to downsize? I am assuming it is an SUV or truck for that cost. Unless, of course, it is a truck that is needed for work.", "Stop enabling them. They lied to you and gave your money away so clearly they don't need it. NTA", "Is there a treatment program that your sister could get into locally? It's so hard to get yourself pulled out of addiction...", "NTA. If you want to continue to help your parents you can almost certainly pay the bank or car company directly.", "NTA", "NTA. Why are you paying for their car again?? So they don\u2019t help drug addicted sister?? I don\u2019t really get that. I\u2019d stop paying it. You can\u2019t stop them from giving sister $ even if it if wrong. Stop paying. Then they will have to divert the cash to car payment and drug sister wins w to deal with her $ problems herself. Giving $ to a drug addict you may as well flush down the can. She\u2019ll spend it on drugs. Count on it.", "NTA. The money was given to them for a specific use. There's no reason that they couldn't put it to the car ahead of schedule. They were given instructions not to give it to your sister. They failed to follow. And I'm sure that when you were younger, they told you that actions have consequences.", "I've changed my mind. You're all YTA !  No one who can't afford a Mercedes needs a Mercedes period!  Things have changed and dad needs too downsize his car and probably other lifestyle choices.", "Sell the Mercedes. Problem solved", "I'm trying to think what car this could possibly be. I just got a 2023 Kia soul which for me was an absolute SPLURGE after my $4,000 car that I used up until it died for good. My payments are only $240 a month for this brand spanking new car, even though it was marked up to the high heavens. Wth could this thing be?", "NTA you gave them money under a condition help you sister with her drug problem by not giving in and they broke that promise I\u2019d stop giving the money to them and tell them maybe if they respected your boundaries you\u2019d be able to help them", "NTA and 700 for a car payment is way too high.", "NTA. Your parents lied to you and, in effect, stole your money. $700 per month is a big deal, in my book at least. You're certainly in the right to not give them more money for the next three months, and/but you also need to have a sit-down with them, with an earnest discussion about your money and helping your sister. They showed total irresponsibility in diverting the money you gave them to your sister, because I assume they knew that you're not willing to underwrite her addiction.\n\nIncidentally, sometime people excuse behavior like this, saying well it was for her [fill in the blank] not for drugs! But the person you're talking about wouldn't need to be taking money from other people at all if it weren't for the drug-taking. So don't let your parents try to talk you our of your thinking this way, and let them know what they did to you was dishonest and they need to earn your trust again.\n\nGood for you for regularly putting money into savings.", "NTA. Your parents are enablers. Do not fund their luxury car & sister\u2019s drug habit.", "NTA - Don't give them one more red cent. Go find another place to live. It's not fair for you to have to watch your parents kill your sibling.", "!nta! i\u2019m sorry sweetie having an addict in the family is a heavy burden on everyone involved :( i would really stop giving them money though. or find a way to pay it without sending them the money first", "NTA. Stop giving them money because unfortunately they are fueling her addiction.", "You are never an asshole for not giving away your money, they aren't entitled to it, its entirely yours to keep or give to them.", "NTA your parents are fleecing you, hard. There isn't a rational reason why someone who can't afford their own bills would have a car that costs $700/month. If you keep falling for this stuff, YWBTA to yourself. There is no amount of money you can give them that will shift their  \"golden child,\" mentality to you. It really sucks, and I absolutely know how that feels, but you need to be the one person who prioritizes you.", "Stop the enabling.", "Well said!", "Yes, exactly. I bought my 20 year old truck for 6500 outright and paid about 300 in advance for 6 months insurance on it. 200ish for permanent plates/registration. It doesn't have bluetooth or an infotainment screen, but it gets me where I need to go. I do miss the backup and side cameras that newer vehicles have, but it feels so much better having something that's 100% mine, even if I were to lose my job tomorrow.", "Probably a brand new luxury full sized SUV.", "I work at a bank lol. Most payments I see are in the 2-5 hundred range but brand new SUVs, trucks, and luxury cars can have extremely high monthly payments. It's a terrible idea to get a loan like that, in my opinion, and I hate that we often approve folks for loans with monthly payments that, in addition to the couple hundred in full coverage insurance, end up eating a majority of a person's paycheck.", "The parents might have absolutely terrible credit, though, in addition to a luxury vehicle. I drive a 2022 Trailblazer (there were literally no decent used cars in my area when my other one went to car heaven) and my payment would have been far better if my credit was better. But still, $700? Does OP have proof that the payment is that much?", "Civics are great cars. They'll take you to the ends of the earth.", "Logged thousands of miles doing college debate all over the mid Atlantic, hundreds of miles per trip going home from college, not once did it break down on me anywhere or give me any issues on a road trip. 160,000+ miles and still going strong", "Damn, dude got me, I was all sympathetic, too.", "Yep, that's exactly how I described my Civic too ('04, I had it til 2020 then I gave it to a friends' kid and it is still going). Never left me on the side of the road."]}
