Your parents basically defrauded you to pay for drugs.   If they want to help kill her,  that's their (IMO disturbing) prerogative.

Stop helping them. NTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou and your parents had an agreement. They broke that agreement. You are 100% within your right to stop providing additional help to them especially given that it is a large monetary support.", "NTA. Your parents need to go to a clinic for codependency. They cannot fix your addict sister with love and money. You need to protect yourself and not get sucked into the middle. \n\nSide note, I\u2019m sorry. Addiction tears families apart in the worst of ways. Big stranger hugs to you.", "NTA,\n\nSave your money and you\u2019ll thank yourself in the future. Clearly they\u2019re going to help her regardless even though you set your conditions so they\u2019re doing this to themselves.", "NTA, and if they want help with the car, you can set up a direct withdrawal from one of your accounts instead. If you still even want to pay for it.", "NTA. Don't give them the money anymore and when they ask tell them they can enable your sister's addiction with their own money not yours.", "NTA.\n\nJust tell them, without the fuck off, that they violated your agreement and you\u2019re ending it.  You are not subsidizing your sister\u2019s drug use directly or indirectly, and you\u2019re not sacrificing your economic stability and future so they can.\n\nPoint them to resources  for parents dealing with their children\u2019s drug addiction.

They don\u2019t need the help. If you help them make sure you pay the company directly. Don\u2019t give them cash.", "NTA the money wasn't theirs to give to your sister. \n\nAlso a thing for you to learn here: never give money. If someone needs a bill to be paid and you want to help, you ask for the bill details and pay the bill yourself. If someone asks money for food, you buy the food with them, you don't give money. That way you can ensure the money goes to what it was asked for and agreed to.", "\"I now I just feel like telling them to fuck off because my money was wasted on her\"\n\nDo it.  Right now.

It\u2019s wonderful you want to help your parents, but by paying their car payment, you are actually enabling your sister. Let them know you will not give them any more money because they continue to enable your sister, and you refuse to help do that. If they are struggling financially, they can trade their car in for something with a much smaller payment.", "Nta\n\nThey\u2019re taking advantage of you and your kindness.

Maybe you can set it up so that, the money goes straight to the car payment only. And not give them cash every month.", "NTA under any circumstances. It's your money, and it sounds like they broke a trust.\n\nI disagree with the black and white attitude in a lot of these responses though.\n\nYour sister is still their daughter. They're her parents. Of course they're going to want to help her. Whatever she does wrong, they still love her and want to keep her out of trouble. They just don't know how. \n\nI don't know what the best solution is. Maybe cutting them off is necessary but please, at least, talk to them about this and how they breached your trust.", "NTA, they broke the agreement so you are fully justified to stop giving them money.", "NTA. Stop giving them money.", "NTA. They broke the agreement.", "NTA.  You are perfectly within your rights, legally and morally, to not pay their car payment.   \n Heck at 23, you're a hero for supporting your parents like this for so long.  \n\nSo, your family is leaking $$ to your sister and won't stop.  This becomes a situation of self-preservation for your family and for you.\n\nYou can advise your parents to stop, I bet you already have, but you can only make yourself do or not do certain things.  Let your parents figure this out *without your* financial help; you have the rest of your life to think about.  Please care for yourself and your future.", "NTA- and I would just stop altogether.
