That's what our politicians keep telling us.", "Found the Cigna rep", "Yeah, that was not mine nor my mother\u2019s experience with glioblastoma. 100ks of dollars (multiple brain surgeries are more expensive than ass surgery, who knew!)out of pocket. Medical bankruptcy. I\u2019m not trying to be a dick, but the person you responded to just had a v bootstraps view of cancer treatment (I pulled myself out of 10k dollars of debt and everyone else should too!) that is not the normal for the United States.", "You don't know what my co-pays were. *I* created those low monthly payments. It was not a suggestion. I suspect they were ok with it because they got them every month, and no one had to call & call. Those payments started as soon as I got the 1st bill. Wanted to get out Infront of it.", "I don\u2019t know about other countries. I live in the US and understand the health crisis here. I cannot comment on other countries and what they do.", "Seconded - A Brit", "You said you had to pay $10k out of pocket. That is what I was referring to. That is **relatively** low compared to what someone without insurance would have to pay.\n\nI'm not trying to attack you. What I'm trying to communicate is that sometimes we have to recognize that we are in a place of privledge, and our experiences cannot always be compared to someone else's.... And, it is sad that healthcare is seen as a privledge instead of a basic human right.\n\nMy monthly health insurance payment is roughly the same amount as my monthly rent. I'm fully aware that many people cannot afford that. It's not as simple as \"I did it, so you should be able to do it, too.\"....", "Having to pay $10K out of pocket for cancer treatment is not a place of privilege.", "NTA. She's in a tough spot and cancer is scary af, yes, but guilting and shaming you isn't okay.    \nYou don't have the money to donate. Her pressuring you isn't going to change that. You do not have to go into debt to pay for her treatment.", "EVERY STATE in the USA has Medicaid - it\u2019s medical coverage for anyone low/moderate income who is diagnosed with a medical condition can apply for Medicaid and free or reduced healthcare .\nThere is no reason to be crowdfunding for \u2018cancer treatment\u2019.", "NTA. Crowdfunding begging is out of control. My friend has cancer and started a campaign.  I must admit I was a bit appalled to find out that they started it, in their own words, that they viewed it as an opportunity to collect money, even though they didn't need it.  They anticipated that they would have unforseen expenses and then said that they would also buy luxury items.\n\nBased on that I wasn't planning to donate, but later felt that I better at least \"make the list\" as a donor to be supportive.  Which is just ridiculous, but in this case these are very good friends and the amount given was affordable. Which is NOT your case. So again. NTA.", "NTA yes cancer treatments are expensive but she doesn't get to judge those who cannot give. Life is expensive and giving is a choice and shouldn't be tied to friendship.", "NTA. No.\n\nFor some reason, people head for a \"GoFundMe\" as a means of asking for, and/or giving \"support\" for just about everything, these days.  \n\nI know I'm old fashioned ... I'm old ..  but we gave emotional support, physical aid, when we could, and actually put some effort into fundraising, as a group, with an activity that brought us together to share in the effort.  We did a fundraising dance or even car washes. And as much as it was work, to start, we had the companionship and team feelings ... plus a lot of laughs ... while helping someone who needed it. The feeling of community was, in itself, rewarding, as we banded together to help someone we cared about.  Often strangers joined in, and also had the warmth of being a good person.  Gathering things for a family was a coordinated effort, with people pulling stuff out of their own homes, and feeling good about being needed, and being able to help.\n\nClicking a few buttons on a computer page ... ?\n\nMoney.\n\nNothing else.  Absolutely nothing else.\n\nOh ... Forgot. You get to write 3 sentences about how you just LOVE \"being there\" for them.", "NTA: Who asks for money outside the go fund me to people they know socially?", "NTA. The simple truth is you cannot afford to donate. I'm sorry for your friend's diagnosis, but if you don't have the funds, you don't have the funds. And although some charities have seen significantly lower donations since the pandemic, there are some she could apply for instead of badgering you. My sister's insurance did not cover all of her treatments and the center she was treated at directed her to some charities that paid the remaining balance.", "NTA.  You don't have the funds.", "NTA.

We do not have a right to demand other people's money, even in light of callous, unfair and poorly organised healthcare systems.", "NTA but maybe reword your post - \u201cI recently found myself in a difficult situation when a CLOSE friend of mine . .  .\u201d \u201c. . . But we\u2019ve never been particularly close.\u201d", "ok, but the friend is an AH, too. start a gofundme if you want, post the link in all your social media, etc, but don't personally reach out to harass the people who haven't donated.", "It is tacky simply to be born somewhere? Really?", "Yes, the friend made a choice of questionable tact. Agreed. But I try to be more forgiving of breaches of social niceties when things like cancer are involved. You know, huge life upheavals that cause untold physical and psychological damage, where your options are typically \"pay out the ass and you may survive\" or \"be poor and you'll definitely die.\" Desperation and trauma cause people to act in weird ways.", "And with 'the people' you mean lobby groups with huge funding to push through their will, right?", "I mean. I\u2019m from here and I think it is tacky AF", "How expensive medical costs are doesn\u2019t matter. People should not expect others to help them with medical treatment. If they can, great. If not, deal with it by finding other avenues to pay.

Got a 10000 bill for treatment is privileged? Really?\n\nEveryone has the option to negotiate payments for healthcare bills. You have to ask, but the hospitals/doctors offices want some payment rather than nothing.", "I think you missed the point of my comments... \n\nThe current state of healthcare is tragic, unfair and abusive. People shouldn't have to resort to begging to simply stay alive. And it is an objective fact that there is a great divide in the experiences between someone with insurance vs someone without. Not only in costs but access to treatments.\n\nThe original commenter said they were able to do it without asking for help, since they have insurance, and implied others should be able to do it, too. But, that's not the reality for many who can't afford insurance.\n\nI've dealt with major medical challenges with and without insurance. The experiences were night and day... Thankfully, the most costly was after I had health coverage. Even with a \"good\" job, i dont know what I would have done if faced with the full costs of those bills. I had to cover 20% and still paid somewhere between $15-20k..."]}
