On top of that, I'm currently going through a tough financial situation of my own, and I simply can't afford to donate a substantial amount of money to her cause.\n\nWhen I told her this, she got incredibly upset with me.

On the one hand, I understand that cancer treatment is incredibly expensive, and I know that my friend is going through a lot right now.

When my friend was dying of cancer I promise you it meant more to her that I showed up for her till the very end giving rides to chemo, spending the night and reading to them when they were lonely, and hanging out with them for years versus giving them a single monetary donation.

If she can't accept that as an answer that's her problem. It sucks what she's going through but that doesn't mean she can emotionally blackmail people into giving her money. And yeah, it is shitty to hit people up individually to donate to their causes.

She was recently diagnosed, right?  So, unless she's late stage or has started chemo or radiation treatment, then she's probably still able to work.  And she may have some medical bills, but those may not be racking up really high yet.  Has she stated what this morning ney is going to be spent on?  Because, based on your post, it sounds like it may be a money grab.", "NTA  \n\n\nDon't let her guilt-trip you. She's not entitled to one cent of your money.

It is never OK to pressure someone into donating for a charitable cause.
