He's a consultant.  ETA:  Actually more like a paid intern or an apprentice.  Look up what either of those pays in your industry in your area, and if neither does, ask a friend who's in a union what sounds reasonable.  If it sounds like a lot for a 9-year-old, give him some so that he sees a return for his labor, but put the rest in a savings account for him.  My local credit union will segregate money in a parent's account in a minor child's name, and when they turn 18 they can do the paperwork to claim that money with the parent's consent.  It's a great start to adulthood.", "NAH, you're giving him a chance to do what he loves and to learn more about it. I do think you should pay him a little bit for helping though. I think it's awesome that he has this opportunity.", "NAH. It\u2019s a bonding activity for you both. He loves doing it, you love doing it, and it\u2019s productive. But if he\u2019s doing actual work for you that you\u2019re making money on then he should get some money. Like $10 every hour he\u2019s helping you. If you continue to have him do this without pay then you may start being the asshole.", "I mean\u2026you are, quite literally, using his labor. I\u2019ll say NAH since you seem genuinely keen to involve him in something you both enjoy, but it might be worth finding another coding activity you can both do together purely for fun so your son never looks back on this experience thinking he\u2019s been used. The lack of compensation for your son and the power dynamic of you having him \u201chelp\u201d are the things that might make you the AH if he continues to do your actual work.", "As long as your son truly enjoys doing them, then NAH. Your wife is rightly looking out for your son. I would just check that he is doing them because he wants to and not just because he wants to spend time with you/wants to impress you (if he is this is ok but maybe look at doing something not work related to do with him too)", "NAH he\u2019s learning something he wouldn\u2019t have had exposure to, she doesn\u2019t want her kid exploited so pay the kid", "I would be interested in what your company would think of this. I know even letting someone see my computer screen can be grounds for termination.", "LOL I think you were here with the same story about your 9 yo princess programmer daughter and how her coding wasn\u2019t tHaT gOoD, but suddenly when it\u2019s a boy, \u201chis solutions are usually great\u201d mmm yeah you thought we wouldn\u2019t notice the same story premise??", "INFO\n\nWould your company be okay with you doing this?", "NTA \n\nYour son enjoys it and he\u2019s learning as long as he\u2019s not forced or doing to seek approval then he\u2019s fine", "NTA if the kid enjoys it. Tho toss him an hour pay. This will show him work is rewarded, especially if you use his work in final product. It will show your wife you don't expect \"free\" labor. \n\n\nIf the kid doesn't like it and tou have him do it anyway then YTA but that doesn't seem to be this situation.", "Hahahahaha! Well, this is an embarrassment of riches. You should pay your son an \u201callowance\u201d, for helping you. You are teaching your son skills and he likes it, so it isn\u2019t the worst things. Plenty of kids babysit for younger siblings or work in a parent\u2019s store with out pay. Maybe set up a small side business and teach your son how to work on side projects together and split the pay? When he\u2019s older, he can take on more and more.", "You just reinvented the father-son apprentice tradition\n\nHe's having fan, learning a trade and bonding with his dad; **Triple Win**\n\nNTA", "NTA. It's educational, it's not interfering with his school and you're not forcing him to do it. I wonder how your wife feels about all the child actors, models and youtube influencers out there.", "Nta. Kid is enjoying it and you get to spend time together. Just make sure you reward him for his efforts", "NTA\u2026it seems that he enjoys coding and is enjoying learning more.  It seems like an amazing father-son bonding time.  If you were making him do this against his will then you\u2019d be the AH.", "Of course NTA, but you should take the opportunity to teach him a life lesson and \"pay\" him an allowance of some kind for doing this with you.\n\nIf he's that intelligent and already obsessed with coding at age 9, let him get a taste of the incentive structure and he'll be a millionaire by the time he's 20.", "9 years old and already coding? Don't listen to the wife, she just wants to start drama but also give your boy a reward and tell him how proud you are. I'm just starting to learn how to code and your 9 year old is already probably coding more complicated scripts than what I'm trying to learn.", "I don\u2019t think so, seems more like bonding and teaching. As long as he isn\u2019t being forced to do it or finish if he doesn\u2019t want too. He should get some coin for it though since he is truly helping with your job.", "NTA.\n\nHOWEVER, I would be careful here, if you become dependent on his solutions, then you are no longer hired for your skill, but your son's skill.  In a classroom setting this could be considered cheating as you are asking someone else to do your homework, so teaching your son about those kind of boundaries may be difficult if you allow this.  Also, do you give credit to your son?  Does work know that on occassion he's coding your work?  If so, then I guess its okay, but if he is also not given credit then that also says something.", "I'd say NTA. As long as he's interested in it and wants to do it, you're not exploiting him for free labor.", "NTA. Bringing kids up to speed in the family business when they're ready has been the norm for a very long time. And (speaking from personal experience here) you're doing him a huge favor for when he starts taking programming classes. Everyone else will feel overwhelmed and lost. He will feel like a superhero.", "NTA. Reddit is wild sometimes. Your son is *voluntarily doing something he enjoys*. He is getting bonding time with you, learning a great skill and presumably can stop any time he wants.\n\nI used to help my mum with her work when I was a kid. Children have been working in the family store or on the family farm or whatever else for generations. \n\nSaying you\u2019re exploiting him or stealing his intellectual property is hilarious.", "NTA.\n\nI'm completely baffled by your wife's reasoning. It sounds more like you're giving him an apprenticeship that will greatly benefit him in the future.\n\nAlso, it doesn't sound like you're forcing your son to code for you; as written here, it sounds as if he's perfectly free to walk away and not do any coding if he doesn't want to.\n\nWhy does your wife object to this? It's really peculiar.\n\nNTA.", "NTA  \nSounds like you are encouraging and challenging his natural skills and interests. I would just be sure that you acknowledge his work both verbally and with some kind or reward/payment and make sure it stays completely voluntary. The moment he doesn't want to do it anymore, you stop.", "NTA. \n\nIf he\u2019s really that interested in coding and he is the one to initiate this then I see nothing wrong with it as long as he gets some form of compensation. Whether it\u2019s a new toy at the end of the week and money towards his college fund, his favorite meal, or whatever.", "NTA. Sounds like a great bonding and educational opportunity. I do think a treat for his work is in order. \n\nThe people acting like he's doing all your work don't know the difference between writing a few lines of work and doing the whole job.", "I'm sorry son, Mom says you were having too much fun bonding with Dad. You go play video games by yourself. /s\n\nNTA!!", "YTA.  You're taking his intellectual property and claiming it as your own.  You can create other coding projects for him that aren't related to your job.  What happens when you get a promotion based in part on your son's work?  Will that be fair to the other candidates who couldn't use your son's work?  Your wife is right.", "YTA since you\u2019re using the work that your kid wrote. You literally are using his labor in this situation", "Why does this savor so strongly of the dad with a 9 year old *girl* who started learning code, asking us if he was T A for straight up putting her down?\n\nIn any case yeah, YTA. You're exploiting your kid.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

But really you are teaching him an amazing skill. We are living in the age of technology. Knowing how to code can open so many doors for great paying jobs. He wants to learn and help. You would be doing him a disservice by not teaching him and letting him help.", "As long as you are checking his work and compensating him for it, NTA.  This sounds like a great father/son activity and learning experience for your son.  I could understand your wife being concerned about possible exploitation if this wasn't something your son enjoys.  As long as he enjoys it, I see no problem.", "Fantastic! I'm a programming lecturer and you're giving your son such an incredible learning experience. Nothing beats practical problem solving. It would be cool, though, to make him up a little pay packet for his work.\n\nEdit. NTA", "NTA how else is he going to learn to code?  however, it wouldn\u2019t be wrong of you to give him some money for helping.", "NTA. This is no different than teaching him to paint, woodworking, auto mechanics etc. Your son has talent and desire and you're enabling him to hone a very useful skill.", "Christ no! You are setting him up to have a great future.", "This is how my cousin learned and he started off making well into the 6 figures right out of college. Encourage this!", "Please adopt me and teach me a highly marketable skill while praising me for creativity.", "If your son is learning and enjoying himself who cares, NTA", "Holy shit you\u2019re NTA. This is amazing bonding time for you and your son and he\u2019s learning a skill that\u2019s super useful.", "This is exactly what I was going to say. He's found something he's good at and could be making money doing when he gets older. You can encourage him to learn more about coding by paying him for his work. NAH assuming you make this small change, but you'd be TA if you continued using his work purely for your own benefit.", "This sounds absolutely brilliant! Also good man op.", "Exactly this! You will be the asshole if you offer him nothing in return. Even if he\u2019s gaining something about of this dynamic because he enjoys coding, the reality is that you certainly ARE using him for labor, which doesn\u2019t have to be a bad thing! Just offer him some kind of compensation, financial or otherwise. You could offer to take him for a fun outing or something like that. There are opportunities for even more bonding and fun here!", "How is it any different by using a kid's labour by making them do chores like washing dishes or mowing the lawn.", "INFO: How do corporate boots taste? Sounds like you lick a bunch of them.", "Lol there\u2019s no *way* he\u2019s giving credit to his son, if his employer found out about this he\u2019d be immediately fired.", "I used to go help my grandmother after school. She was a school librarian at a different, but nearby, school... 20 years later, I'm a librarian.", "Yeah he droned on and on at length over how silly it was for her to be a \u201cprincess programmer\u201d but all of a sudden when it\u2019s a boy, he\u2019s this coding baby genius\ud83d\ude02", "It is generally accepted that parents can ask children to help with household tasks as they all live in the home and contribute to dirty dishes etc. The issue here is that a 9-year-old child is completing work OP was hired for, without compensation or recognition. Honestly I think many employers would fire OP if they found out the reality of this situation as 9-year-old children are not legally able to work in many countries and especially not without the employer\u2019s knowledge. I think it\u2019s a grey area situation which could quickly devolve to an exploitative one.", "I fucking love princess programmer, I wish we could all send her like encouraging cards or whatever.", "Honestly this is a way to kill his love for coding as he grows up so sorry, YTA. Get him coding things that are fun for him when he solves them like minecraft. Commodifying your kids fun is grossly capitalistic and cam ruin the experience after the fact.", "NAH. As long as he likes it, fine. Mom is right in being concerned about it happening daily for an hour a day. He has a life of work ahead of him, he could be playing or socializing in that time.", "NTA to your son. I don't think it's bad intention. \n\n\nBut if it's corporate work , you should not be giving it to him. Instead find him another personal project.", "NTA. Your son is lucky to be already learning a skill that could potentially help him make a living in the future. What is more, you are spending time together doing something you both enjoy. I believe you wife should be ecstatic. I certainly would.\nGreat parenting, OP.", "NAH. I do think however that you should consider paying him. If you are regularly incorporating it into the work you are paid for, in a literal sense you are technically using him as an unpaid labor source. It doesn\u2019t sound like that was your intention or something you are abusing by any means, but now that you see his work is at that level, he is more than deserving to get paid for it if you are. \n\nI would approach this as another learning opportunity for him. Help him learn how to determine/negotiate the worth of his labor while he\u2019s still developing his skills.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s having fun!  That\u2019s the equivalent of getting mad when father and son play sports together to have fun, and the father implements some of the kids\u2019 strategies in his own play.", "NTA since you\u2019re not forcing the kid and it sounds like he enjoys it. Still, I think you should be paying him. You are using his work as your own.", "NAH. You should definitely throw him some walking around money if he\u2019s doing useful work though. It will motivate him. A kid who can code like that at his age won\u2019t even need to go get a CS degree to be successful. He can just get a meaningless Associate\u2019s degree from a community college to have a piece of paper for HR. I sure wish my daughter had taken me up on my many offers to learn to code. Instead, she took out loans for 5 years of out-of-state tuition flailing through 3 different majors and then dropped out.", "NTA, and good for you! I\u2019d personally give him money every time you use his code. :) \n\nMy dad was a computer programmer - I desperately wish he taught me it, growing up!", "NAH. Sounds like he's enjoying this, and you aren't forcing him to participate - if he's that advanced in his understanding, what about looking into the adult lego sets like Mindstorms, that let you create and program robots from lego. On your days off, or in the evening, flip it around to you helping him with coding projects that are purely for fun - let him take the lead. I bet you'd both really enjoy projects like that, and it's going to make for amazing bonding time with your son that you'll both cherish.", "NTA I would just call this extra curricular activities, like learning to bake, or working on grandpa's car, or carpentry, or learning to ride a horse, or learning an extra language, or learning how to throw pots if mum was a potter, or sculptor or painter, or whatever. Or a kid going out hunting with his dad. I do not see how it is any different. It just so happens dad is a software engineer.", "Nta. How's mom's relationship with her parents?", "NTA. We own our own company and 2 of our kids love \"working\" with dad. He finds ways to utilize them on the weekends and breaks but it's never forced. We also give them a (very) small percentage of the profit from the job if they help on it. There is nothing wrong with letting your child do something they enjoy and it creates a special bond.", "Yes, and there\u2019s also a tax benefit to paying your child\u2014 I think it\u2019s an income up to ~$13,000 that your child doesn\u2019t owe tax on.", "YES!  At 9, I was already doing basic bookkeeping work for my father's accounting firm.  He showed me how to proof the monthly books of some clients, a process that is self-checking, and let me run with it.  (This was back almost in the Pleistocene--okay, 1960s--when everything was recorded by hand and checked using a printing calculator.)\n\nI was paid.  Very little of that was pocket change, but it went into a bank account for me, and my parents made the point that work ought to be paid.  In today's economy, when everyone wants young adults especially to do things for \"exposure\", the message that contribution ought to be paid for is an excellent one.  It teaches children that they don't deserve to be taken advantage of.\n\nNAH, unless you *don't* start paying him.", "Op, do not pay him.  My guess is that you have a confidentiality agreement and you are violating it with your son. \n\nSecond, one can make a case that while they own your work, they don't own his.\n\nWill it ever come to that? No. But please ... don't teach your kids that everything is transactional and about money ... or they'll grow up to be the in the majority of commenters on this forum.", "Ya NTA to his son but the legal liability and the company regulations might be a different story.", "You can also open an IRA for your kid as soon as they can report earned income. Starting that at age 9 would be huge.", "Imagine telling your boss, yeah lil timmy wrote modules 3 and 5 out of 15. \n\nIt's just not the same.", "If his father was a groundskeeper or a dishwasher in a restaurant and he brought his kid in to do his work for him it would be the same.  OP isn't having his kid do household chores.  This is work that his company is paying OP to do.", "Well, that\u2019s unnecessarily rude."]}
