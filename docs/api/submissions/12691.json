He's a consultant.  ETA:  Actually more like a paid intern or an apprentice.  Look up what either of those pays in your industry in your area, and if neither does, ask a friend who's in a union what sounds reasonable.  If it sounds like a lot for a 9-year-old, give him some so that he sees a return for his labor, but put the rest in a savings account for him.  My local credit union will segregate money in a parent's account in a minor child's name, and when they turn 18 they can do the paperwork to claim that money with the parent's consent.  It's a great start to adulthood.", "NAH, you're giving him a chance to do what he loves and to learn more about it. I do think you should pay him a little bit for helping though. I think it's awesome that he has this opportunity.", "NAH. It\u2019s a bonding activity for you both. He loves doing it, you love doing it, and it\u2019s productive. But if he\u2019s doing actual work for you that you\u2019re making money on then he should get some money. Like $10 every hour he\u2019s helping you.

I\u2019ll say NAH since you seem genuinely keen to involve him in something you both enjoy, but it might be worth finding another coding activity you can both do together purely for fun so your son never looks back on this experience thinking he\u2019s been used. The lack of compensation for your son and the power dynamic of you having him \u201chelp\u201d are the things that might make you the AH if he continues to do your actual work.", "As long as your son truly enjoys doing them, then NAH. Your wife is rightly looking out for your son. I would just check that he is doing them because he wants to and not just because he wants to spend time with you/wants to impress you (if he is this is ok but maybe look at doing something not work related to do with him too)", "NAH he\u2019s learning something he wouldn\u2019t have had exposure to, she doesn\u2019t want her kid exploited so pay the kid", "I would be interested in what your company would think of this.

Well, this is an embarrassment of riches. You should pay your son an \u201callowance\u201d, for helping you. You are teaching your son skills and he likes it, so it isn\u2019t the worst things. Plenty of kids babysit for younger siblings or work in a parent\u2019s store with out pay. Maybe set up a small side business and teach your son how to work on side projects together and split the pay?

Don't listen to the wife, she just wants to start drama but also give your boy a reward and tell him how proud you are.

He should get some coin for it though since he is truly helping with your job.", "NTA.\n\nHOWEVER, I would be careful here, if you become dependent on his solutions, then you are no longer hired for your skill, but your son's skill.  In a classroom setting this could be considered cheating as you are asking someone else to do your homework, so teaching your son about those kind of boundaries may be difficult if you allow this.  Also, do you give credit to your son?  Does work know that on occassion he's coding your work?  If so, then I guess its okay, but if he is also not given credit then that also says something.", "I'd say NTA. As long as he's interested in it and wants to do it, you're not exploiting him for free labor.", "NTA. Bringing kids up to speed in the family business when they're ready has been the norm for a very long time. And (speaking from personal experience here) you're doing him a huge favor for when he starts taking programming classes. Everyone else will feel overwhelmed and lost. He will feel like a superhero.", "NTA. Reddit is wild sometimes. Your son is *voluntarily doing something he enjoys*. He is getting bonding time with you, learning a great skill and presumably can stop any time he wants.\n\nI used to help my mum with her work when I was a kid. Children have been working in the family store or on the family farm or whatever else for generations. \n\nSaying you\u2019re exploiting him or stealing his intellectual property is hilarious.", "NTA.\n\nI'm completely baffled by your wife's reasoning. It sounds more like you're giving him an apprenticeship that will greatly benefit him in the future.\n\nAlso, it doesn't sound like you're forcing your son to code for you; as written here, it sounds as if he's perfectly free to walk away and not do any coding if he doesn't want to.\n\nWhy does your wife object to this? It's really peculiar.\n\nNTA.", "NTA  \nSounds like you are encouraging and challenging his natural skills and interests. I would just be sure that you acknowledge his work both verbally and with some kind or reward/payment and make sure it stays completely voluntary. The moment he doesn't want to do it anymore, you stop.", "NTA. \n\nIf he\u2019s really that interested in coding and he is the one to initiate this then I see nothing wrong with it as long as he gets some form of compensation. Whether it\u2019s a new toy at the end of the week and money towards his college fund, his favorite meal, or whatever.", "NTA. Sounds like a great bonding and educational opportunity. I do think a treat for his work is in order. \n\nThe people acting like he's doing all your work don't know the difference between writing a few lines of work and doing the whole job.", "I'm sorry son, Mom says you were having too much fun bonding with Dad. You go play video games by yourself. /s\n\nNTA!!", "YTA.  You're taking his intellectual property and claiming it as your own.  You can create other coding projects for him that aren't related to your job.  What happens when you get a promotion based in part on your son's work?  Will that be fair to the other candidates who couldn't use your son's work?  Your wife is right.", "YTA since you\u2019re using the work that your kid wrote. You literally are using his labor in this situation", "Why does this savor so strongly of the dad with a 9 year old *girl* who started learning code, asking us if he was T A for straight up putting her down?\n\nIn any case yeah, YTA.

I believe you wife should be ecstatic. I certainly would.\nGreat parenting, OP.", "NAH. I do think however that you should consider paying him. If you are regularly incorporating it into the work you are paid for, in a literal sense you are technically using him as an unpaid labor source. It doesn\u2019t sound like that was your intention or something you are abusing by any means, but now that you see his work is at that level, he is more than deserving to get paid for it if you are. \n\nI would approach this as another learning opportunity for him.

Still, I think you should be paying him. You are using his work as your own.", "NAH. You should definitely throw him some walking around money if he\u2019s doing useful work though.

He can just get a meaningless Associate\u2019s degree from a community college to have a piece of paper for HR. I sure wish my daughter had taken me up on my many offers to learn to code.

Sounds like he's enjoying this, and you aren't forcing him to participate - if he's that advanced in his understanding, what about looking into the adult lego sets like Mindstorms, that let you create and program robots from lego. On your days off, or in the evening, flip it around to you helping him with coding projects that are purely for fun - let him take the lead.

Kids can 'work' in safe contexts for short periods of time. \"Child labor\" is not 1 hr of computer coding every couple of days.

If he likes it, is good at it, and continues to do it for you, then it\u2019s kind of like bonding with him, right? \nMaybe set up a bank account for him and deposit minimum wage into it for him so when he\u2019s a little older, he\u2019s got $$ to be responsible for!", "I think exercising your son's gifts are different from exploiting them. NTA. My best friend is a mathematician and computer scientist. Its amazing to me what her kid can do that I never learned to do, frankly.\n\nLearning is a good thing. So, remind your wife that your son is expanding his skill set. He's not actually performing your job. You still have to make sure he got it right, don't you? Offer him some reward every time he's right, until his reward comes from being right. And one day, as is the natural order of things - he'll be smarter than you are and the earth will keep spinning.", "NTA. As long as he enjoys it and you aren\u2019t forcing him to sit there to do the work I don\u2019t see the problem. It\u2019s a good skill to have that he could use in a lot of different ways and possibly even a career one day.", "So... are you paying him for doing your job for you? YTA", "Yeah YTA\n\nYou are using your son for labor, you are farming out your coding - that you are being paid for - to a child, which I imagine you are NOT paying him for - since you don't mention any renumeration.  So that would actually be *slave* labor\n\nIf you want him to do\\learn coding, find some interesting challenges on the Internet for him to get into.", "INFO:\n\nWhat are the confidentiality and proprietary information agreements you signed with your company? Because you could easily be risking your job if you are doing anything more than talking general implementation strategy, and not actual syntax.", "NTA.", "NAH. And I\u2019m not sure you should pay him. I think paying him would reduce his interest in coding and make your relationship a little bit commercial when it\u2019s a bonding thing.", "NTA; if you wanna work out an allowance thing, you can do it, but there's nothing wrong with what you've been doing.", "NAH but pay him. \n\nMy dad did something similar with me.\nI did data entry from paper sheets for him so he could focus on actual important stuff (was entered by 2 people, reconciled, and corrected so no harm in having a young teen do it). \n\nI got paid quite well for a 1st job (but less than what it would cost to hire someone or outsource it) which meant I could buy more video games. \n\n20 years later, I work in data science.", "NTA. this is amazing. Your kid is going places and it\u2019s because you are developing his mind! My parents made me pull weeds at that age. Id rather know coding \ud83d\ude04. Regardless I\u2019ve got the nicest lawn on my block and it\u2019s all due to habits instilled early.", "NTA it\u2019s literally nature at work. If it was a farm you\u2019d have him doing small jobs like collecting eggs etc to help the family and teach him a the same time. \nIt\u2019s literally developing his brain. It\u2019s your job as parents to do this.", "I doubt it was the same person, even if the premise is similar", "Exactly. Either the kid is a once-in-a-generation prodigy, the work is mind-numblingly simple, or (god forbid!) someone might be lying on the internet.", "There is an issue that could crop up with pay though. Especially in children, but true for all ages, offering an extrinsic reward for something intrinsically motivating reduces interest in it. Obviously eventually you get paid anyways but psychologically it might hurt his interest in coding. For example if a child loves reading and her parents offer her 5 bucks for every book she reads to encourage it even more, she\u2019ll have a brief spike in interest before reading far less.", ">  like you're giving him an apprenticeship\n\nApprentices, get paid\n\nThere are child labor laws\n\nThere may be security and confidentiality clauses in the OP's contract\n\nThe OP is misrepresenting his work to his employer\n\nThere may be a case that the OP is stealing his sons IP\n\nThere are a million and one other ways for the OP to encourage his son to learn coding other than farming out work that the OP is paid to do to his sone - approx. 5-6 hours of work a week by the sounds of it which as a software engineer the OP is probably getting paid in the region of $80 - $150 or more an hour to perform, so you could possibly even include fraud", "> You're taking his intellectual property and claiming it as your own\n\nDidn't think of this angle when I made my YTA comment", "> How is it any different by using a kid's labour by making them do chores like washing dishes or mowing the lawn.\n\nIts different because the OP is making money of his child's work.  The OP is also misrepresenting his work to his company.  There could also be a case of stealing his sons IP", "get the kid an ankh necklace and kufi hat, time to rise and grind bozo", "Now I'm picturing OP being the laziest worker fathomable, handing in completely unworkable bits of code obviously written by a child and not even looking at them. I'm sure if this was real he would be totally shocked upon his inevitable firing.\n\nI guess if I had to come up with a reason OP would lie about this I'd say maybe he does have a 9 year old son that programs, but he's using \"it's definitely for work I've created a genius\" to cover for pushing the kid, giving him hours of extra curricular dad-homework every week when he's got real homework to work on. Sort of like the nerd version of the pushy sports dad."]}
