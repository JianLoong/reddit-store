My lord child", "Your stretching. \n\nOP - is there more to this story? \n\nLike, based on the comments I am currently swatting at, unless your husband has some sort of abusive history with you, do you really think his behaviour is as bad as most of these comments? \nLike was there was malicious intent in bringing you to dinner?", "Just clarifying that no, I would not love to go to an expensive dinner. We\u2019ve been married for a while and sometimes all someone wants is to go home and rest, we can do fancy dinner another time.", "What on earth makes you think I wasn\u2019t clear this was her husband\u2026?\n\nIf he showed up with flowers to take her to a fancy dinner, the intent would be better but it would really depend on if she\u2019s someone who likes surprises or not. But it\u2019s really not relevant because he was in no way attempting to do something nice for her.", "It\u2019s very inconsiderate to make plans for someone without consulting them. This is, like, Social Interaction 101.", "Thanks for adding in. \n\nMy point wasn\u2019t about you loving a fancy meal, but that if the destination was different the end result would/could have been different as well. I totally understand you not wanting to go to dinner (you and I are in similar boats) but I go every time because she wants me to. It sucks. But she is happy and that\u2019s good enough for me.", "So, OP commented and said no, an expensive dinner out wouldn\u2019t have made a difference. But it did change your stance. \n\nYour original comment you opted to use \u201csomeone\u201d instead of husband. By removing the relationship from the post makes it sound like the husband is no more than an acquaintance. Yes, that makes a significant difference", "For sure it is, but it happens. A husband caving into a dinner request by his parents isn\u2019t exactly the social event of the year. She literally just had to go eat dinner. Sure if he had signed her up for some sort of volunteer program or physical labour but dinner? Really? \n\n\nI am guessing we have a solid 20+ year age gap", "No, nothing changed about my stance at all. My opinion would be slightly different about a completely unrelated situation that didn\u2019t happen. That has nothing to do with my stance on this.\n\nIt\u2019s a crazy thing to do no matter what your relationship.", "Yes, really. It would\u2019ve cost OPs husband absolutely nothing at all to be totally transparent and ask (yes, ask) his wife if she was interested in going to dinner. Sometimes after a long day at work I\u2019d honest to god rather to do volunteer physical labor than be forced to play nice and socialize for hours. \n\nAnd idk how old you are. I\u2019m old enough to treat my wife with common courtesy and respect and to expect she treats me the same way. We\u2019re going strong after a decade so we must be doing something right ."]}
