If he planned something nice for her as a surprise, but she was exhausted after work/had another genuine reasons why she wanted to go home instead, but he still insisted she had to do the thing with him because it was something she normally liked, and he wouldn\u2019t take her home, she would absolutely be justified in calling her own transportation and leaving.
