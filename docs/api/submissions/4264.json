{"id": 4264, "submission_id": "zg52gq", "title": "AITA for asking my neighbours to be more considerate?", "selftext": "My neighbours are a young couple in their 30s (Annie and Bill), they've had a baby a couple months ago. The baby came home last month after 3 months in hospital. My wife is friendly with Annie, we can't have children so whenever we have a neighbour with a baby my wife makes friends with them. We have my mum staying with us, as she is no longer able to live independantly.\n\nMy mum has complained several times that she can hear the baby crying, especially at night. My wife says the baby has bad reflux, and they are trying to deal with it. The baby screams several times a day, its awful listening to the poor thing cry for so long. It does feel like they aren't dealing with the baby as quickly as they should be. The baby screamed for 10 minutes solid the other night. My wife says that the baby screams when they bathe it, as Annie has told her that baby doesn't like being bathed. Baby is always crying and its frustrating, especially when mum needs peace and quiet to recover from surgery. \n\nSince the baby has come home, there is no longer any room on our street during the day as we have on street parking. This is making it difficult to get mum to appointments as she can't walk to the end of the street to get her in the car but we also can't park in the middle of the road as it blocks the road and can take over 10 minutes to get her in the car due to mobility issues. There had always been at least one empty bay outside our house but now it is always occupied by either someone from their families visiting or one of the healthcare professionals involved in the baby's care. \n\nI reached a breaking point at the weekend. Mum had been home alone all day and she was in tears when I got home from work. Wife was away visiting friends. She said the baby had been screaming all day long. It was still crying when I came home. I went and knocked on Bill and Annie's door to ask if they could quieten the baby. I could see through the frosted glass that Annie was sat on the bottom of the stairs not even trying to calm the baby down. When she came to the door, she apologised and said she had been trying to calm baby down, but the new medication was making him constipated, and he was straining to poo. She had Bill had gone to pick up an emergency prescription to try and help. I snapped as she clearly hadn't been trying as she was on the stairs and told her that they need to be more considerate of others and if she didn't quieten the baby then I would log a noise complaint with the police. Annie was upset at this and closed the door in my face. When my wife came back, she told her what I had said. \n\nNow my wife is angry with me as I was making life difficult for a young couple with a sick baby and is giving me the silent treatment. I feel like I may be in the wrong because of how my wife has reacted, but at the same time, the baby is always crying and I think they need to be more considerate of their neighbours.", "created_utc": 1670519702, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zg52gq/aita_for_asking_my_neighbours_to_be_more/", "score": 2190, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

On street parking means it's game for anyone, even if it's an inconvenience to others.  Filing a noise complaint because of a *crying baby* is ridiculous.  I actually hope you do and you come back here to indicate how big of a laughing stock you are for doing so. \n\nExpecting someone to be able to magically stop a baby from crying that has health issues is also unreasonable. That's not how babies work.  Just because the baby was crying when you went over to make your ridiculous demand and wasn't being held doesn't mean the parents aren't actively trying to soothe their child and instead are taking a moment to catch their breath - as reasonable parents and people often times do when things get stressful.", "YTA. And a huge one at that! She was sitting on the stairs. You decided she clearly wasn't trying to calm the baby bc of that. \n\nShe likely HAD been and then laid the baby down and went to take a moment for herself. I've had to do the same with my kids. It's better to put them down if you're frustrated and walk away to take a breather. You ever try calming a baby if you're frustrated? It doesn't work. \n\nThey are doing their best, but sometimes a baby with medical issues is inconsolable. Instead of asking them to be considerate, which I'm 100% sure they're trying to do, why don't you be patient? Play music in your home to drown out the sounds. Watch TV. But don't be as AH to a new mom who is probably burnt out, exhausted, and trying her best. \n\nI don't even want to imagine how you would be as a parent in this situation.", "YTA. You can't possibly be serious with all this.", "I'm going to get hate for this, but thank God you can't have kids. Your lack of empathy and inability to sympathize are outrageous. Real babies aren't like dogs or dolls. I would hate to see how you would've treated your wife or your own child.", "YTA. Have you considered how the couple feels? They're the ones in charge of a sick baby they can't placate.\n\nAsking for some consideration about parking is completely reasonable \u2014 letting them know that you need accessible parking at certain times is well within neighbourly relations. At this point, though, I think you've probably burned a bridge.", "Holy shit YTA!\n\nHospital for 3 months? Still has medical professionals doing home visits? Is on medicine?\n\nIt\u2019s very clear to me that this isn\u2019t a typical baby. This is a *very* sick baby with parents who are trying to do everything they can to ease its suffering. You can\u2019t just put a gag on a sick and suffering *newborn*!\n\nInvest in some sound proofing for your mother if you must but also invest in some fucking compassion for your neighbours who are clearly overwhelmed.", "Yes, YTA. This young couple is obviously struggling with the child. I don't even understand the comment about there being no room on the street \"since the baby came home.\" It's not like the baby came with a car included.\n\nBabies are a part of life, (one would think your mother would understand that,) and there's no guarantee they're going to be quiet when you want them to be. The new parents obviously didn't ask for all this. And you want to add to the new parents' stress by being a dick? If you can't handle it, then move.", "Excuse me, how did this escalate from the wife telling you that her husband was out getting the baby's medication, to you accusing her of \"not trying\" and threatening to call the police? She did absolutely nothing to warrant that snap from you. You happening to catch a glimpse of her sitting there is not indicative of \"not trying.\" You have no idea what's happening behind closed doors with this clearly very sick baby. Go apologize.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Do you really think your neighbors enjoy having their baby scream? They\u2019re just doing the best they can. Their baby had to live in the hospital for *three months* so clearly they are dealing with some really serious medical issues on top of all the regular baby stuff. They\u2019re not annoying you on purpose. \n\nIf you require a certain number of parking spaces and never being able to hear your neighbors, then it\u2019s on you to move somewhere with dedicated parking and farther away neighbors. Part of city life is that you coexist with other people and you can hear each other. If you don\u2019t want to do that then move to the suburbs.", "YTA. Babies cry, sick babies cry more. It\u2019s not your job to judge new mom for sitting on the stairs\u2014if you\u2019re annoyed next door imagine her life inside with a person she loves in pain. Now she has to deal with you? Get your mom noise cancelling headphones. Reserve the car space on days you need it, or ask the people parked there to move, or ask the city to make a handicap spot. Your problems are yours alone to deal with. Leave those poor people alone.", "YTA - If you think it\u2019s rough to live next door to a crying baby with health issues, imagine living WITH the crying baby with health issues. It\u2019s completely overwhelming and demoralizing. They are quite obviously struggling right now. I promise you, they are not choosing to have the baby cry. If they could press a magic button to make it stop, they would have pressed it long ago. \n\nYou also aren\u2019t entitled to primo street parking. Go get the car for your mother if you\u2019re so worried and mind your own business.", "So let me get this straight.\n\nTheir baby is so sick, it spent the first three months of it's life in the hospital, and has healthcare workers come to visit several times a week.\n\nThe baby cried for *GASP* a whole TEN minutes the other night, and you think this is a sign they aren't doing everything they can. What do you want her to do, sit and have an honest conversation with a literal baby about how disruptive they're acting....?\n\nYou and your mom are incredibly self centered. The world does not revolve around you. **Why do you think your mother's recovery is more important than the baby's?** Try to have some empathy, for god sake.\n\nYTA. A huge gaping one.", "What do you expect them to do, muzzle their baby?  YTA", "I am not a mom and will never be one by choice. But holy crap are YTA. Try thinking about what those parents are going through instead of yourself. Yes, it's hard to listen to a baby cry but how do you think the parents feel that their NEW BORN BABY WHO WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF IT'S LIFE feel? Maybe the NEW mom was sitting on the steps because she needed a mental break. \n\nIn case I wasn't clear, YTA.", "YTA. Don\u2019t need to explain why.", "YTA and this is coming from a person who hates babies", "YTA. I don't have kids, never will have kids, but even I know sometimes, ESPECIALLY with babies with health issues, there might be no stopping that crying. Could be she had been trying to quieten the child all morning and you just saw her when she was taking a momentary break when nothing else was working.\n\nAs far as parking goes, you could have talked to them about it rather than just sitting there letting your frustration reach a breaking point, that doesn't do anyone any good.", "YTA\n\nGet yourself a white noise machine.\n\nYou have no compassion for your neighbors who are struggling with their infant. \n\nSitting on stairs not doing anything\u2026.really? You don\u2019t know what she has been doing or not doing and what they are dealing with.", "YTA. Babies cry. Sick babies cry a lot. It\u2019s tough for everyone, including the mom and dad who can\u2019t seem to calm them no matter what they do. And frankly, I\u2019ve let my child cry alone for a few minutes while I stepped outside to regain a sliver of my sanity. Being a parent is really, really hard, even before neighbors come knocking to make their child free judgments on people who are just doing their best. \n\nGet some noise cancelling headphones for your mother and leave those people alone.", "YTA. Are you more angry with yourself for not being able to afford a big house on a nice piece of land? Sounds like you\u2019re taking it out on the neighbors that you can\u2019t afford the lifestyle that you want. If you live in close proximity to neighbors with insufficient parking and insufficient noise blocking, then you need to understand that\u2019s your choice and it\u2019s not your neighbors fault the street is set up that way and you decided to move in anyway.", "YTA - You focus on berating parents who are physically and emotionally maxed out. You failed to explore things you can do to cope given this situation will not likely last forever. Can your mom wear noise cancelling headphones, listen to music, or a book on tape with headphones? Plan out-of-the-house family experiences like driving to view holiday decorations and lights. Explore community day programs for senior folks or online meet ups. When we increase positive stimulation in our own lives we decrease our focus on what annoys us. Control what you can control.", "YTA \n\nThey have a baby. They aren\u2019t setting off fireworks or using power tools! \n\nIf your mother has mobility issues, get an accessible parking pass and petition your local government to put a space there for you. God forbid that your neighbours actually have people visit!", "YTA - As you can see, your mother and you are not the only ones in existence!", "YES. YTA! Their newborn took 3 months to come home from the hospital and they're regularly visited by medical professionals. You need to calm down and have compassion, there is literally nothing they can do but cope with their baby's needs. The street parking isn't yours exclusively and you should move if its so critical that you have designated parking.", "YT major A. You actually think you're going to win this? \n\nMove. Just solve all your problems and move. Your wife can stay in the house though. She's compassionate and sounds lovely.\n\nYour poor neighbors are trying to handle not only a completely life altering event with a new baby, but now navigating what sounds to be a colicky baby. Parent's just don't jump into being a maternal/paternal instantly and know exactly what to do either. This is all brand new to them. \n\nFor you to shame the poor momma for sitting down for one minute and call her inconsiderate to others is absolutely abhorrent. You have no idea what her sitting down for just one minute could have meant. She needed a second and you berated her and threatened to call the police for a crying baby. Guess what - she's probably crying too for more reasons than you may think. \n\nSuch an AH. End of story. \n\nSigned, A Mom.", "I'm not going to judge, but I want you to think carefully about what might solve these problems.\n\n1. Can you get a disabled tag for your car and a disabled parking space for your mother so that she doesn't have to walk so far? Call your city/the apartment complex/your elected officials.\n2. Are there any practical ways to minimize the noise? Can you change your mum's room? Can you put her bed on the other side of the house? Would a white noise machine do anything? Can you ask the baby's parents to change their rooms around? If not, what do you expect the parents to do? They hear the cries much more loudly than you do.\n3. If you don't have a practical solution or favor to ask, then there is no point in contacting the parents.", "Yes YTA, I'm not sure that this really needs explaining as it seems like it would be stonking obvious to the average human with any ounce of compassion or humanity.", "FYI, if a baby is in the hospital for 3 months before it is taken home, it has major issues. YTA hugely.", "YTA. \n\nYou have no idea what that poor new mom is going through. You really think they enjoy hearing their baby cry the whole day so they don\u2019t try to soothe the baby? If you think it\u2019s hard to live next door to a colicky newborn, try actually being the parents of one. \n\nThat new mom is probably very stressed, tired and sleep deprived. You just added on to her troubles.", "What exactly do you expect them to do?  Smother the baby?  YTA. You'd better hope you never experience hard times that require other people's understanding.", "Info:\nWhat do you suggest they do?\n\nYta", "Hahaha this has to be a troll. On the off chance it's not...\n\nYTA.\n\nPlease please call the cops. How do you think that'll go? Better hope a complete AH cop without kids shows up or my money is you being arrested for harassment and/or assault (depending what \"snapped\" means).\n\nYou're not entitled to street parking. Get a handicap tag & spot of your mom qualifies. \n\nFor the noise, buy noise canceling headphones. \n\nTo make up for being such a massive AH, apologize and offer to baby sit for a night (make sure your wife is up for it first as they probably won't trust their kid alone with an AH like you) and pay for your neighbors to go for a nice dinner.", "YTA and this comes from someone who can\u2019t stand screaming babies either. What do you want them to do? I can guarantee that the screaming is 100 x worse for the parents. She was probably sat on the stairs because she was about to lose her mind and needed a break. You are horrible", "YTA how do you expect them to quiet the baby? Tell it to stop? Have you ever been around a baby? Lmfao this is so ridiculous", "YTA\n\nI absolutely guarantee that as miserable as you are, the parents of that baby are ten times more unhappy. It's absolute hell when you can't help your baby and all they do is cry. When all you hear is crying day and night, it's enough to make a normal person snap, which is why people will tell you it's ok to put the baby down and take some time to compose yourself.\n\nYou just added the fear of a noise complaint to the issues this couple is already dealing with.", "YTA. The world does not revolve around you and your mother. Your mother has issues? Guess what, so does the baby!!!  And what do you expect the police to do? Arrest the baby? This has got to be the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. Get ear plugs, buy headphones, move, do anything other than ever interacting with your neighbors ever again!", "YTA. The biggest, actually. Seriously, I can't say much more without getting put in timeout here.", "Imagine complaining that street parking spaces are being taken up by medical professionals trying to treat a sick infant.\n\nGet your mom some earplugs You're both grown adults, you should be able to figure out how to deal with noise by now. YTA", "YTA get over yourself. Babies cry. Babies with issues cry a lot and sometimes there isn\u2019t a damn thing a parent can do to stop it. And whoa you caught her sitting for a moment. That\u2019s called taking a breather because she deals with a baby that has had and continues to have health issues. Stop being the obnoxious judgmental neighbor.", "YTA  you cant hold a baby 24/7 and if you are frustrated imagine how they feel, not sleeping right, no peace in their home.  The words I'd really like to say to you cant be posted.  \n\nLeave them alone!", "YTA.  You think it\u2019s bad for your household, try theirs.  Those poor parents are dealing with a child that spent 3 months in the hospital and is still having medical issues.  They probably are beyond exhausted, stressed and feel like complete failures.  You what shouldn\u2019t happen to them?  Have a neighbor harass them while they are suffering through this.", "It's a sick baby it's going to scream and she is also recovering as well. I don't even like babies YTA", "oh, wow. YTA\\*I\\* had a baby with reflux. He would scream for HOURS, and literally nothing could be done. I tried, my husband, my parents. We did different feeding, different beds, swings, meds...You're only thinking of YOUR experience here! 30 feet away, there is a family in agony. You're suffering?! Try being the mother of a baby that is in intense pain, and being unable to help, to soothe, to make him feel safe. She walked away for a minute and sat at the stairs? Yeah, I bet she did. She's exhausted, she's frustrated. She's in hell.Stop being such a selfish jerk and bring over a casserole. Buy your mom some earplugs. Put a stool at the end of drive, walk your mom down to it, seat her, then pull the car around.The baby will grow out of this. You will remain an asshole.", "YTA. But to try to be constructive, maybe buy a white noise machine for your mom's room? Probably won't fully drown out a baby but I think they can help a ton to make it manageable.", "Wow you have gone have gone beyond asshole. They know the baby is crying and they would also like the baby to cry less; do you think they enjoy it? Do you think your shouting is going to quiet the baby down? You need to stop it immediately. It's not their fault there is no parking on the street, either. Suck it up and deal, same thing with your mother. Get her some earplugs or something but Jesus christ you gotta knock that shit off.", "Clearly YTA. It's unfortunate that your wife is unable to have children, it sounds like she would have been a loving and caring mother. It's obvious that you should never be a parent. \n\nYou can control the situation with some ear plugs or even a pair of noise cancelling headset where you mother could listen to music or watch television as a distraction from the baby's crying. \n\nThese poor parents cannot control their baby's health issues and force their child not to cry.\n\nYou have obviously never been around an inconsolable baby, and for the sake of that child please make sure that it never happens.", "I have no kids, never wanted kids, but you are a huge YTA.

Babies aren\u2019t born with buttons you push to make them stop crying. And this baby obviously has serious health issues if he spent 3 months in the hospital. Eventually, reflux eases up (for most) and the crying will lessen. They may still have guests coming and going, but nothing you can do unless you move somewhere with dedicated parking spaces.", "YTA. It is normal for a baby to cry for more than 10 minutes. Sometimes they take ages to calm down. If the baby has bad reflux then it's worse (like bad heartburn) and there s nothing the parents can do to calm the baby. Annie sitting at th ebottom of the stairs may have been her trying to calm her own nerves from the screaming.\n\nWhat is not normal however is for the couple to come back after *3 months* so it's likely there were complication during the birth or the baby was sick.

I\u2019d be terrified to add stress to that situation, for fear they would take it out on the baby.  For crying out loud, think about the big picture!  Wanna help?  Maybe make friends and ask if you can help them, watch the baby while they take a walk or prepare some food for them or just sit and have a cup of coffee with them while they are dealing with a difficult and sick newborn.
