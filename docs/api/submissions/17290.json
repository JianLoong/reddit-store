I work late and tend to end up staying up for a while to relax when I get home, so when the kids woke up pretty early I was extremely tired and woke her up so she could keep an eye on them so I could get some sleep before work. \n\nWell, I guess she was really tired because she ended up falling asleep on the couch at some point in time and the kids ended up destroying the house. Without getting into too much detail, there were several huge messes that needed to be cleaned up immediately. I had to do my laundry and shower and all that for work, so I couldn't really help but I did make my own food so she didn't have to worry about that and could just focus on cleaning (normally she makes my lunch so I don't run late). She seemed a bit down when I left, probably upset about all the mess that had to be cleaned.\n\nSo when I got home I figured I'd check on her and ask if it got better and if she had a good mother's day. She got upset and snapped at me how could she possibly have a good mother's day when the only thing she ever does is have to take care of the kids and clean up huge messes and not sleep when she wants so she can serve me dinner when I get home (I don't ask her to cook every day for me but I'd like a nice meal at least half the week after working hard, it's up to her when those days are and these last few days she didn't really cook but just made fast simple foods.

Had them help you make her breakfast maybe. You should have had the house clean and the kids happy and clean and stuff to make your wife\u2019s day as easy as possible while you were working and then you should have come home with flowers (or whatever it is she likes, a potted plant, a bottle of wine, whatever) and a hot meal so she didn\u2019t have to cook.

She wanted to feel like a whole human being who is appreciated and celebrated for the hard fucking working she does every day in taking care of the kids and you. You couldn\u2019t even give her that.
