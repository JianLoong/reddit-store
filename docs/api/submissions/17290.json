I work late and tend to end up staying up for a while to relax when I get home, so when the kids woke up pretty early I was extremely tired and woke her up so she could keep an eye on them so I could get some sleep before work. \n\nWell, I guess she was really tired because she ended up falling asleep on the couch at some point in time and the kids ended up destroying the house. Without getting into too much detail, there were several huge messes that needed to be cleaned up immediately. I had to do my laundry and shower and all that for work, so I couldn't really help but I did make my own food so she didn't have to worry about that and could just focus on cleaning (normally she makes my lunch so I don't run late). She seemed a bit down when I left, probably upset about all the mess that had to be cleaned.\n\nSo when I got home I figured I'd check on her and ask if it got better and if she had a good mother's day. She got upset and snapped at me how could she possibly have a good mother's day when the only thing she ever does is have to take care of the kids and clean up huge messes and not sleep when she wants so she can serve me dinner when I get home (I don't ask her to cook every day for me but I'd like a nice meal at least half the week after working hard, it's up to her when those days are and these last few days she didn't really cook but just made fast simple foods.

Are you planning on waking up early with the children , making all their meals and having a nice hot dinner ready for your wife? Have you ever given her a day off?  You stay up late to \" relax\" after working hard - your words. When does your wife have time to relax ? She works hard as well. You have that time because YOUR wife takes care of everything else!  If you skipped staying up late and got up with the rest of your family you would have time to participate in getting the kids ready for the day, prepping meals, cleaning up , HELPING to parent the kids that you helped create.", "Isn't that convenient for you.", "Jesus christ on a bike man\n\nHELP YOUR WIFE", "Big yikes to ALL your replies my dude. Whatever she may or may not want to do on a day off is up to her (and I\u2019d imagine sleeping in / just not having to stress would feel amazing for her). You don\u2019t get to deny her self care or me time because you deem her chosen activities unworthy.", "She couldn't go anywhere or do anything anyway. Because her job is 24/7/365.", "Ahhhhhhh, even worse \ud83d\ude00", "It's also irrelevant if she has (outdoor) hobbies or a social life.\n\nSome people just aren't very social or like to stay home. How she chooses to spend her off days shouldn't influence if she has any. \n\nIf she wants to sleep in and watch Netflix she should have the opportunity to do so once in a while.", "Why? Why doesn\u2019t she make plans, have any kind of outlet? Does she have an opportunity?", "That's a good one. Know any more?"]}
