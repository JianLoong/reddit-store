Karen is very outspoken about being childfree. She will frequently bring up, without being asked, how she never wants kids, thinks they're annoying ad too expensive etc. I truly dont care whatsoever that that is her view and would never advise anyone who doesn't want kids to have them.\n\nAnyway we were all talking about movies being out in theatres when my wife made a comment about how we hadnt been to a movie in 3 months and wont be for awhile most likely. Said something about how its hard to get out for a date night and if we do there's just other things we'd choose. Karen then said without being asked \"Dont expect us to be babysitting for your date nights, I do NOT want to watch a baby\". I  responded \"dont worry, I would never have you watch my child.\" My sister and husband laughed, my parents smirked but didnt say anything. Karen seemed embarrassed, didnt say much for awhile and then left about half an hour later without my brother.  \n\nYesterday my brother texted me that my remark was rude and I should have just kept it to myself and she now thinks my whole family hates her.

Your comment was exactly as polite as hers.", "NTA and why is she offended?\n\nShe has made it abundantly clear she doesn't want to be around children. So why would she expect you to ask someone so hostile to kids to look after yours? She is the rude one.

He can ask them individually.", "Speaking as a vehemently childfree person: NTA and I don't even understand why she was offended. If she even was offended: is perhaps your brother making a fuss about nothing?", "NTA. She was rude first, you were just returning her energy.", "NTA. What in the world? You weren\u2019t soliciting a babysitter and she just declared she would never?  She should have seen your response coming. \n\nMethinks the lady doth protest too much.", "NTA. The woman made a point of telling you she refused to babysit. Period. Your response was appropriate considering her behavior.", "Nta \n\nWhy would you leave your kid with some who is shows open disdain for them?\n\nAnd why would she be pissed for you giving her exactly what she says she wants?", "So your comment was rude but not his wife\u2019s? Your brother and his wife sound like jerks. NTA.", "NTA, the whole family's opinion of her didn't change because you made one sarcastic comment. If she didn't want to get called out then she shouldn't have said anything anyways.", "NTA - she made a rude statement & you kindly answered to reassure her she would not be asked. Now SHE is insulted? It\u2019s kind of crazy that she\u2019s upset for getting the result she wanted.", "NTA. Her statement started it - you were reacting. In any event, you should be able to play it off as funny banter.", "NTA\n\nShe hates kids, why would she assume you'd ask her to watch them?", "NTA \n\nShe was rude first. You replied in kind. \n\nIf she\u2019d kept her mouth closed, she wouldn\u2019t have been met with a) your snark or b) a request for babysitting in the first place.", "You simply responded to her rude declaration. Sounds like she wanted attention. I\u2019m childfree by design and have never felt the need to talk about it or make such ridiculous declarations. NTA", "NTA: it is pretty rude for her to make that comment. You weren\u2019t even asking. Your SIL clearly has insecurities. No parent wants to hear how annoying someone else thinks their kid is so I get why you made that comment.", "NTA.  Perfect response honestly. She wants to be mouthy, she can take it.  Sounds like she doesn't only dislike kids, she sounds insufferable.", "NTA\n\nI'm 100% on the child free train, probably with views even a lot of them would find going a bit far. But two big things spring to mind that clearly make you NTA. \n\n1. You didn't fucking ask, If people are going to throw things out unsolicited then they have no right to be upset if someone gives an unsolicited response. This clearly falls under \"If you can't take it, then don't dish it out\" \n\n\n2. Your statement could have just meant \"I know you don't like kids, so I would never have you watch my child\" Even if you don't take that assessment, it's very reasonable that someone child-free would not have the demeanor nor the knowledge to watch someone's kid. So they would be a very bad choice just for your kids sake. Assuming you care about your kid, and maybe about the CF person, you would not want to put either of them in that position. \n\n\n\nLike I said I'm completely CF, but I'm not a dick about it. Fine to bring up when asked or relevant, but like a lot of things sometimes it's best to just shut the hell up about it. No one needs 15 minute updates letting us know you still feel <whatever>.", "Nta, she was very rude, you just agreed with what she said, lol.", "NTA.

I find it odd that your brother expects you to keep everything to yourself when his wife is continuously doing the exact opposite.\n\nI mean, if you constantly comment about how much you don't want children.

She\u2019s obnoxious and her rude opinions needed to be addressed.", "NTA. FAFO.", "NTA you confirmed her wishes. Why would anyone ask someone who vehemently hates kids to babysit?\n\nBeing butthurt doesn\u2019t make it valid, it\u2019s up to her to decide how she presents herself to others and whether she\u2019s proud of it.", "NTA but I like the \"random\" name you chose for her.", "NTA, not at all.  OP is just reassuring the child-free SIL that they intend to support her child free existence.  Why would this be offensive to SIL?  Seriously, why?  No parent in their right mind would push child-care onto someone so vehemently against children.", "NTA Her remark was rude. You just clarified that you wouldn't ask her anyway.\n\nIf she doesn't want to watch your kid anyway, why is she acting so butt hurt over being told you wouldn't ask.", "NTA\n\nShe should have just kept her mouth shut.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t keep her remarks to herself, so why do you have to? Ask your brother that. And ask why she even assumed with her attitude she\u2019d be chosen?", "Ha! Great response, she sounds insufferable to be honest\n\nNTA", "NTA. I can understand the fact that she was upset everyone laughed at your joke though. Maybe she does not understand that she needs to stop putting the childfree subject on the table so often?", "NTA-She was loud and proud to announce they would not babysit for you. You were simply  confirming that you knew her choice and accepted it.", "NTA who would logically ask someone so vehemently anti baby to watch a baby? She can\u2019t have her AH cake and eat the baby too. She should stop being so rude if she\u2019s that sensitive", "NTA - who asked her to?", "NTA - she's made being childfree and quite frankly just disliking children a significant part of her personality. She goes out of her way to ensure everyone knows that she doesn't want or like kids (and babies). Then right after she literally says \"don't ask me to watch your baby,\" when you confirm that you definitely wouldn't have her watch your baby, she's upset? Like I get it...she's upset that you gave off the impression you feel she's unqualified to watch your child, or your child wouldn't be safe, etc. But that's because SHE'S GONE OUT OF HER WAY TO MAKE IT EXTREMELY CLEAR SHE VERY MUCH DISLIKES CHILDREN. So why does she then expect you to ever think she's a qualified babysitter?", "NTA at all", "NTA but as as side note, does your area have a drive in theater by any chance?

You could very easily say that you made that statement out of consideration of her feelings, not the very obvious implication of incompetence. NTA", "NTA-Lack of sleep alone makes it harder to bite one's tongue in the face of rudeness, not to mention hormones and stress. If she didn't constantly center herself, she wouldn't have gotten her feelings hurt. That's on her.", "Lol NTA", "NTA. She\u2019s made it clear she has no interest and you gave her reassurance.", "You need to go to her house and make comments about her place like, \u201cI would never have that color of paint.\u201d \u201cYour couch is something I would never dream of having in my house.\u201d If she has any pets, DEFINITELY comment negatively on them. \u201cThat breed is SO ANNOYING.

Even though she started it, she probably feels like it was an attack on her character.\n\nI was talking to my therapist once about confrontations. I usually avoid them because I tend to get overwhelmed and cry, and then feel guilty because while I'm really *not* trying to manipulate people with tears, it often comes across that way. So I just avoid them all together and keep my mouth shut. I was worried I was avoiding necessary conversations though. My therapist said if I'm not sure about saying something to ask myself the following:\n* Is it true?\n* Is it kind?\n* Is it necessary?\nThat stuck with me and I try to keep it in the back of mind. IMO, you both were honest but unkind. I could see how thr movie comment your wife made may have seemed like a sort of passive aggressive request for babysitting. She might have been annoyed that you were hoping she'd volunteer when she's tried to make it clear that she wouldn't want to babysit given how vocal she's been on the subject. \n\nShe was being very self centered (she sounds young?), but a better response might have been a \"We understand. We'll find someone else.\" Even delivered in a curt tone would have been appropriate I think - which still gets across your point, but doesn't embarrass her.\n\nRemember that the decision to remain childfree still brings a lot of unwanted commentary with it. If it sounds like she's a bit defensive about her decision, she's probably reacting to things that have less to do with you specifically and more to do with society and other comments she's gotten.

I drove in to see a friend, and ended up babysitting her sick kid because she and her husband both had work emergencies.

She's let you know about her opinions on children before, I saw your response as a \"yes, we know how you feel about children by now, you mention it all the time!\" kind of response, which, while cheeky, isn't really rude.  If nothing else, you were reaffirming that you know she is child-free by choice and wouldn't push the boundaries that she has already set.\n\nAs a goodwill gesture, maybe reach out to your brother and say that your response was more in line with respecting her wishes about not being involved with children, and not a reflection on how the family feels about her.
