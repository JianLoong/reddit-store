My oldest is 8 and my youngest is 4. The boys are very, very close and adore each other. My 4 year old son was diagnosed with epilepsy when he was 2 and it has been difficult for him. Sometimes he is so sickly he can only lounge on the couch. He needs extra monitoring. He has meds he takes. He has regular doctors visits, etc. It's a lot for a small kid. My older son was always excited and eager to be a big brother and has been so good to his brother since the diagnosis especially. They light up around each other. My oldest cheers every milestone his brother reaches and he comforts him on the bad days and celebrates his progress on the good days (the epilepsy set him back with walking for a while and on the extra bad days he needs to be carried).\n\nOur youngest had a really bad couple of weeks and was very sickly. Then yesterday he was doing better. When my older son came home from school he arrived at the same time my ILs decided to drop by for a visit. My youngest ran out to greet his brother and the oldest was so happy to see his brother back on his feet and running to him like that. They were hugging and the oldest was cheering on the youngest and my ILs... well.\n\nThe honest truth is my ILs are hardly ever around and the boys aren't the most familiar with them. So it took a few to notice them there. I went up to my ILs and they commented that the boys had a weird reaction to seeing each other since the oldest was only at school. The kids reaction to their grandparents was sort of muted but they did greet them and talk a little bit and my oldest wanted to know if he could watch some Avatar with his brother and I told him he could.\n\nMy ILs were griping about the boys and how they should have been more excited to see them than each other. They asked me why I wasn't concerned with such an obsession over each other. They said the youngest acted like they were strangers (which to him they pretty much are) and how the oldest cared more about a 4 year old than grandparents who could buy him gifts. I sort of laughed and said they were talking like they were jealous. They said it was like they weren't even there when the boys saw each other and that it was wrong and they should have gotten the running hugs and joy. They told me I should not be letting the boys act that way with each other. I told them to leave. They complained to my husband (who was not home at the time) and he ignored them. Then last night they sent me a bunch of messages saying the same stuff and saying I was rude for kicking them out. I told them they behaved worse than my kids ever had and they needed to stop acting like children.\n\nThis started another tidal wave of messages from them saying I was rude and speaking to them with \"such disrespect\".\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681816498, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qjs1h/aita_for_telling_my_ils_they_behaved_worse_than/", "score": 454, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The in-laws sure are though", "NTA and the fact that your kids recognize love as the important thing and not \"gifts\" says more about your quality as a parent and hopefully for their future happiness. It is all too often when siblings do not like each other and you are lucky to have this source of joy and love in your house. But to try and smooth things with your ILs you should try to focus on that in future and not on their (your IL's) behavior. \"It's weird obssession\" - \"No, it is sibling's love\"... if they can't recognize it as such says more about their family than yours.", "NTA - you are right in holding your ground and I am glad your husband is backing you up.

Your boys have a wonderful sibling relationship and your in laws seem to be on the 'friends of my parents' - level for the kids.

If you show them that you're really interested in them, their likes and dislikes, you'll be the greatest dude.
