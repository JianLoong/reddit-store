My oldest is 8 and my youngest is 4. The boys are very, very close and adore each other. My 4 year old son was diagnosed with epilepsy when he was 2 and it has been difficult for him. Sometimes he is so sickly he can only lounge on the couch. He needs extra monitoring. He has meds he takes. He has regular doctors visits, etc. It's a lot for a small kid. My older son was always excited and eager to be a big brother and has been so good to his brother since the diagnosis especially. They light up around each other. My oldest cheers every milestone his brother reaches and he comforts him on the bad days and celebrates his progress on the good days (the epilepsy set him back with walking for a while and on the extra bad days he needs to be carried).\n\nOur youngest had a really bad couple of weeks and was very sickly. Then yesterday he was doing better. When my older son came home from school he arrived at the same time my ILs decided to drop by for a visit. My youngest ran out to greet his brother and the oldest was so happy to see his brother back on his feet and running to him like that. They were hugging and the oldest was cheering on the youngest and my ILs... well.\n\nThe honest truth is my ILs are hardly ever around and the boys aren't the most familiar with them. So it took a few to notice them there. I went up to my ILs and they commented that the boys had a weird reaction to seeing each other since the oldest was only at school. The kids reaction to their grandparents was sort of muted but they did greet them and talk a little bit and my oldest wanted to know if he could watch some Avatar with his brother and I told him he could.\n\nMy ILs were griping about the boys and how they should have been more excited to see them than each other. They asked me why I wasn't concerned with such an obsession over each other. They said the youngest acted like they were strangers (which to him they pretty much are) and how the oldest cared more about a 4 year old than grandparents who could buy him gifts. I sort of laughed and said they were talking like they were jealous. They said it was like they weren't even there when the boys saw each other and that it was wrong and they should have gotten the running hugs and joy. They told me I should not be letting the boys act that way with each other. I told them to leave. They complained to my husband (who was not home at the time) and he ignored them. Then last night they sent me a bunch of messages saying the same stuff and saying I was rude for kicking them out. I told them they behaved worse than my kids ever had and they needed to stop acting like children.\n\nThis started another tidal wave of messages from them saying I was rude and speaking to them with \"such disrespect\".\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681816498, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qjs1h/aita_for_telling_my_ils_they_behaved_worse_than/", "score": 1196, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they don't, that's their choice and I respect them as people with needs and feelings and things happening in their lives.\n\n*they commented that the boys had a weird reaction to seeing each other* \n\n**They are wrong.**  In the circumstances, it's a delightful reaction.  \r  \n\r  \n*My ILs were griping about the boys and how they should have been more excited to see them than each other.* \n\nSomething deeply wrong in these people's brains and hearts, that **they can't celebrate joy** with their grandkids, that **they try to make it about them,** instead. \n\n*They asked me why I wasn't concerned with such an obsession over each other.* \n\nWhy would you be concerned?  These children are showing love and concern and the ability to have empathy and celebrate joy together.  This is wonderful.  It's not obsession, it's family being family to each other.  Obviously, **these cardboard cutouts haven't a clue how to do family with love and empathy.**  Your poor husband. \n\n*that it was wrong*\n\nNope.  **THEY are the ones doing wrong** here.  No one else.\n\n*They told me I should not be letting the boys act that way with each other.* \n\n\"letting\" them?  Celebrating with them, enjoying their joy in the achievements, what's not to be happy about?  \n\n*I told them to leave.* \n\n**Good for you.  Excellent of you.**\n\n*They complained to my husband (who was not home at the time) and he ignored them.* \n\n**He is also excellent.**  Do a bit of patting each other on the backs, for having raised delightful kids.\n\n*Then last night they sent me a bunch of messages saying the same stuff* \n\nWhat dried up old prune hearts they must have, **all obsessed with their power and control and meanness.  And now, trying to hurt you with their nastiness.**\n\n*and saying I was rude for kicking them out.* \n\nNope.  **You were protecting your children from people that are cruel and joyless** and haven't a clue what love really is.\n\n*I told them they behaved worse than my kids ever had and they needed to stop acting like children.*\n\nThat's fair.  You could have said much much worse true things.  \r  \n\r  \n*This started another tidal wave of messages from them saying I was rude* \n\n**Projection.**  They rudely dropped in.  **They rudely expected kids they've ignored to reward them** with excitement at their very presence.  **They said comment after comment that was nasty,** belittling, humiliating, mean, insulting, dismissive of true love and joy, all aimed at getting attention to them, instead of happy kids being happy together.  **The rudeness was all theirs.**  You spoke some truth to them, but it wasn't rudely done at all.\n\n*and speaking to them with \"such disrespect\".*\n\nThere are manipulators and abusers who think that they should be given the respect due to someone in authority, like a king, from us.  But we are adults, and they are adults.  They are just peers, not in authority over us.  When we talk of respect, we mean the respect between peers.  What they really mean is they want our compliance to their demands, whether they speak the demands or only hint at them.  \n\n**You were not disrespectful.  But they were, to you and your children.  And now, even more so to you.** \r  \n\r  \n*AITA?*\n\nNTA.  \n\nFor these **emotionally and verbally abusive attacks that they are now subjecting you to**, you do not have to keep on reading them or replying.  **It's okay to block them** now.  And if they \"drop in\" uninvited again, it's okay to say to them that \"our new rule is visits by invitation only.\"  And then not let them inside, as you go in and lock the door on them.  **Protecting your children is not rude.  Protecting yourself isn't rude.**", "NTA\n\nYou realize they were subtly hinting at incest, right?

My kid could barely care less about any of them, but he is better with the in-laws because they at least show that they give a shit.", "We don't. We have worked hard to ensure he doesn't give up his own life/childhood for his brother.", "He doesn't always feel good and struggles when he's in his bad times. That's what I meant by sickly.", "He had a sister who died when she was an infant. He was too little to remember her though.", "6 times in 8 years they have seen the boys. My youngest didn't remember them at all.", "Maybe if the grandparents stopped thinking they're ENTITLED to love, they might put more effort into EARNING it.", "Like is there anything sweeter than siblings who adore each other? They should have been weeping over the cuteness.", "These grandparents sound so much like my dad\u2019s parents who used to get super jealous of my maternal grandparents who actually made an effort to spend time with me.  They used to get weird about stuff like how siblings got along too.", "which is so wild. like, rule of thumb with children is to not engage in *any* sort of power struggle, because it sets a terrible standard for how adults and peers are supposed to interact with them. (also they're children and cannot properly wield most types of adult world power, so having a power struggle is ultimately childish of the adult, because the adult needs to be the one with the final say in many many situations. that's a safety thing. children need to know consent, but. you know what i mean.) \n\nbut to engage in an IMAGINARY power struggle with two children who have NO IDEA what you're pressed about? the mental gymnastics. holy shit.", "How on earth will they be excited to see grandparent if they don\u2019t have fun times, affection and good memories with them? It just makes sense to be excited for someone you know vs someone you barely see", "You should ground your inlaws and take away their mobile devices for a week. If they're going to act like children, they should be disciplined.", "Oh ok. Thanks. Wishing him all the best. My first cousin has epilepsy since he was a kid. He is 30 something now living a happy life. Wish the same for you", "a kid feeling like they NEED to care FOR their siblings is different than a kid WANTING to care ABOUT their siblings. sounds like elder tot is here as a helper within his healthy capacity of his own volition. good for him, wish i'd learned early on what those healthy boundaries for my personal ability to provide care were. sounds like OP is already doing a great job of teaching that to her kid. more power to her.", "I\u2019m not the one that said relationships need to be transactional. The person I originally replied to said that and the whole point of my comment was asking them why that doesn\u2019t seem to apply to the brother\u2019s\u2019 relationship. That\u2019s what doesn\u2019t make sense.", "Okay I kinda get the misunderstanding here. I think. The boys have been together since the beginning and have built their close relationship from the start, so their affection was \"earned\" over time. The ILs think they're entitled to the same level of affection even though they haven't actually spent the time to get to know the boys. They think that they can buy affection with gifts or that they've already earned it just for being grandparents, but they haven't. Does that make sense? The point is that the ILs aren't entitled to affection just for being related. And that the younger brother \\*did\\* earn affection, by building the close relationship with his brother.", "THIS", "I\u2019m not policing them, I\u2019m simply concerned about how our of the ordinary they are. We all want our children\u2019s emotions to be what we expect of them and they are that way for a reason. Therefore it isn\u2019t healthy if they dissent from that.", "What\u2019s wrong with what I\u2019ve said?", "Like I said I do think he should care. It\u2019s how emotionally invested he is, not that he\u2019s emotionally invested. \n\nRegarding the problem with him being excited, once again, like I said, it\u2019s not just being excited it\u2019s more than just that as I detailed in the comment you\u2019re replying to.", "Love cannot be earned.", "this is the absolute dumbest take anyone could possibly have about this situation. It's actually truly impressive what a dipshit this comment has proven you to be", "right? there's LAYERS to this assholery. hey grandparents, great job managing to be ableist towards a four year old with epilepsy, homophobic of two brothers not even in grade school yet, judgemental of your son's wife in a very traditionally sexist way, and having some of the worst capitalism brainworms the world has ever seen. like not to sound luke a tumblrina but there are words for these cultural phenomena and i hope OP is comforted in some small way by knowing that others see these bigoted in laws for who they really are \n\nNTA, OP. best of luck with your delightful kiddos.", "bro, you've officially hit the negative triple digits of comment karma. ive never seen anyone die on a sadder, wetter, or worse hill. just leave it. just... just leave it alone.", "It is completely healthy for a child's emotions to dissent from what a parent expects. Parents don't understand the inner workings of their child's mind perfectly. The child is an individual, not an extension of the parent. You can make guesses as to how they might react to a situation, but you can't prescribe how they should feel.", "If the parents were forcing the older brother into some sort of caretaking relationship, I would agree with you that it's inappropriate. But based on what's in the post I don't think there is any indication that the older brother is acting out of anything other than a concern for a dear family member. If your only concern here is that the brother is \"too\" invested in this situation (which does impact him hugely), then I think you may be projecting something onto this. The correct amount for the older brother to care is... however much he cares. Because his feelings are his and no one else's, and he's entitled to react to the situation as he sees fit.", "Why does it matter that I\u2019ve hit such low karma? People are downvoting me a lot yes but why does that matter?  \n\nI\u2019m happy to not die on this hill and have my mind changed but so far people aren\u2019t doing that and are taking issues that I\u2019ve either already explained my response to or can easily respond to. If others were to change my mind then I\u2019m fine with that.", "I\u2019ve not disagreed with you on the fact that because they live together they are going to be most convenient playmates. I have however said that despite living together there are going to be barriers such as age gap and the illness. \n\nMy goal is simply to explain my point of view to you whilst listening to yours.", "How is it ableist? Him being sick is definitely going to cause issues with bonding because as the post says it\u2019s sometimes putting him out of action full stop. That\u2019s all action. Including bonding. That is all I was saying so I don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s ableist?", "it's simply an illustration of the fact that you're fighting a losing battle here. your opinion is unpopular. your view of how children should have compassion for each other is misguided. please take a step back and do some reflection on this. \n\nyou cannot possibly ascertain from OP's initial post with 100% certainty wether the elder tot feels as though he NEEDS to care FOR his brother's disability or if he WANTS to care ABOUT his brother's disability. in my opinion, the post suggests the latter, which is an age appropriate response to someone you care about being sick. being overjoyed that a sibling is feeling well enough to run and play? perfectly acceptable. \n\ndo you even work with kids? have kids? where are you coming from on this? honestly, never mind. you've taken many of these comments in bad faith, and i truly shouldn't even be responding to you. just.... just touch grass bud. please.", "They\u2019ve apparently overcome those barriers and are close. \n\nYou seem very attached to the idea that they cannot genuinely have a close relationship, despite all evidence to the contrary.", "I don\u2019t have a problem with them forming the relationship. My whole point, and the way that this all started was me asking another user why if they\u2019re saying that people\u2019s time and love is earnt then how can that be applicable to the boys. \n\nAs you\u2019ve said they\u2019ve apparently overcome those barriers and are close. That means that if they managed to form a bond that doesn\u2019t rely on the things the barriers prevent then their bond wasn\u2019t earned because the barriers are stopping the development of the earnable things. That proves my point that the other user\u2019s earning respect etc. thing isn\u2019t applicable to the boys."]}
