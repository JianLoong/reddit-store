My oldest is 8 and my youngest is 4. The boys are very, very close and adore each other. My 4 year old son was diagnosed with epilepsy when he was 2 and it has been difficult for him. Sometimes he is so sickly he can only lounge on the couch. He needs extra monitoring. He has meds he takes. He has regular doctors visits, etc. It's a lot for a small kid. My older son was always excited and eager to be a big brother and has been so good to his brother since the diagnosis especially. They light up around each other. My oldest cheers every milestone his brother reaches and he comforts him on the bad days and celebrates his progress on the good days (the epilepsy set him back with walking for a while and on the extra bad days he needs to be carried).\n\nOur youngest had a really bad couple of weeks and was very sickly. Then yesterday he was doing better. When my older son came home from school he arrived at the same time my ILs decided to drop by for a visit. My youngest ran out to greet his brother and the oldest was so happy to see his brother back on his feet and running to him like that. They were hugging and the oldest was cheering on the youngest and my ILs... well.\n\nThe honest truth is my ILs are hardly ever around and the boys aren't the most familiar with them. So it took a few to notice them there. I went up to my ILs and they commented that the boys had a weird reaction to seeing each other since the oldest was only at school. The kids reaction to their grandparents was sort of muted but they did greet them and talk a little bit and my oldest wanted to know if he could watch some Avatar with his brother and I told him he could.\n\nMy ILs were griping about the boys and how they should have been more excited to see them than each other. They asked me why I wasn't concerned with such an obsession over each other. They said the youngest acted like they were strangers (which to him they pretty much are) and how the oldest cared more about a 4 year old than grandparents who could buy him gifts. I sort of laughed and said they were talking like they were jealous. They said it was like they weren't even there when the boys saw each other and that it was wrong and they should have gotten the running hugs and joy. They told me I should not be letting the boys act that way with each other. I told them to leave. They complained to my husband (who was not home at the time) and he ignored them. Then last night they sent me a bunch of messages saying the same stuff and saying I was rude for kicking them out. I told them they behaved worse than my kids ever had and they needed to stop acting like children.\n\nThis started another tidal wave of messages from them saying I was rude and speaking to them with \"such disrespect\".\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681816498, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qjs1h/aita_for_telling_my_ils_they_behaved_worse_than/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is heartwarming to read how your kids are so close to each other. Your ILs are just opinionated imbeciles.

Yet, they think they are qualified to advice you about your sons. \n\nWhy do they deserve running hugs and joy? What have they done to deserve that? Have they shown love to your sons?

I can't shake the feeling your in-laws would have toned down a notch or two, had they known...", "NTA - Your in-laws were jealous and rude.   It's so sweet that the brothers love each other so much.", "NTA\n\nYour inlaws are ridiculous people if they think their brothers being happy to see each other is \"unhealthy obsession\" \ud83d\ude02", "NTA -- Respect is a two-way street, and the office of \\[grand\\]parenthood does not give the ILs right-of-way/priority. Your ILs just outed themselves as entitled to unearned time and attention.", "NTA block them. That\u2019s the best answer.", "NTA- Sounds like my FIL and his wife. ILs are more concerned that the kids aren't showing them attention because the kids could be using them for money rather than being excited about being with or showing empathy to family. Seems like you now know why they don't spend a lot of time with their grandkids. Your kids don't have something your ILs can get out of them.", "NTA.\n\n>My ILs were griping about the boys and how they should have been more excited to see them than each other.\n\nI would have thought that grandparents would have been pleased to see such a close bond between their grandchildren. Unless they were self-important and demanded to be the centre of attention, in which case it doesn't matter what they think.", "NTA. I\u2019m a preschool teacher. I\u2019ve taught many sibling in my decade-plus. Feeling anything less than joy at the sight of siblings genuinely and openly loving each other is just weird. Envy and disdain is disgusting. I\u2019d be wary of allowing your in-laws around them unsupervised.", "Definitely NTA. The in-laws sure are though", "NTA and the fact that your kids recognize love as the important thing and not \"gifts\" says more about your quality as a parent and hopefully for their future happiness. It is all too often when siblings do not like each other and you are lucky to have this source of joy and love in your house. But to try and smooth things with your ILs you should try to focus on that in future and not on their (your IL's) behavior. \"It's weird obssession\" - \"No, it is sibling's love\"... if they can't recognize it as such says more about their family than yours.", "NTA - you are right in holding your ground and I am glad your husband is backing you up. You should consider going no contact if they keep it up. Next time they text, say you are disengaging from the conversation and if they continue you will block them. \n\nThe tough thing we learn as we get older not all adults act like adults.", "NTA at all. Your in-laws think your sons should have given them  the hugs and kisses because they hardly ever see them and could give them presents? What a transactional (and entitled) attitude. Maybe they dont know the meaning or basis of close loving relationships.", "Their criteria for how much you should love someone is who can buy the best gifts. And they\u2019re not even bothered about saying so! You\u2019ve raised loving, caring, non-mercenary kids and your ILs don\u2019t understand this. The less you see of them, and the less influence they have on your kids, the better, honestly. What sad, shallow people.

Your oldest is showing love and compassion. He's being a supportive big brother. He's doing AWESOME!!! And it's just weird af for anyone to demonize that. \"Aren't you disturbed that your kid shows affection for his family?!\" is just... kinda unhinged. They're saying your disabled child doesn't  \"deserve\" affection and that's just blatant bullshit.", "nta. but i\u2019m having an emotional morning and tearing up at the thought of how nice your boys are to each other", "NTA. They \"drop by\" which I'm guessing from context was an unannounced visit. They then get upset when their young grandkids, who were not expecting them, don't drop everything to make a big fuss over their grandparents.  Who is being disrespectful to whom?
