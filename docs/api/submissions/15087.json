My oldest is 8 and my youngest is 4. The boys are very, very close and adore each other. My 4 year old son was diagnosed with epilepsy when he was 2 and it has been difficult for him. Sometimes he is so sickly he can only lounge on the couch. He needs extra monitoring. He has meds he takes. He has regular doctors visits, etc. It's a lot for a small kid. My older son was always excited and eager to be a big brother and has been so good to his brother since the diagnosis especially. They light up around each other. My oldest cheers every milestone his brother reaches and he comforts him on the bad days and celebrates his progress on the good days (the epilepsy set him back with walking for a while and on the extra bad days he needs to be carried).\n\nOur youngest had a really bad couple of weeks and was very sickly. Then yesterday he was doing better. When my older son came home from school he arrived at the same time my ILs decided to drop by for a visit. My youngest ran out to greet his brother and the oldest was so happy to see his brother back on his feet and running to him like that. They were hugging and the oldest was cheering on the youngest and my ILs... well.\n\nThe honest truth is my ILs are hardly ever around and the boys aren't the most familiar with them. So it took a few to notice them there. I went up to my ILs and they commented that the boys had a weird reaction to seeing each other since the oldest was only at school. The kids reaction to their grandparents was sort of muted but they did greet them and talk a little bit and my oldest wanted to know if he could watch some Avatar with his brother and I told him he could.\n\nMy ILs were griping about the boys and how they should have been more excited to see them than each other. They asked me why I wasn't concerned with such an obsession over each other. They said the youngest acted like they were strangers (which to him they pretty much are) and how the oldest cared more about a 4 year old than grandparents who could buy him gifts. I sort of laughed and said they were talking like they were jealous. They said it was like they weren't even there when the boys saw each other and that it was wrong and they should have gotten the running hugs and joy. They told me I should not be letting the boys act that way with each other. I told them to leave. They complained to my husband (who was not home at the time) and he ignored them. Then last night they sent me a bunch of messages saying the same stuff and saying I was rude for kicking them out. I told them they behaved worse than my kids ever had and they needed to stop acting like children.\n\nThis started another tidal wave of messages from them saying I was rude and speaking to them with \"such disrespect\".\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681816498, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qjs1h/aita_for_telling_my_ils_they_behaved_worse_than/", "score": 1884, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they don't, that's their choice and I respect them as people with needs and feelings and things happening in their lives.\n\n*they commented that the boys had a weird reaction to seeing each other* \n\n**They are wrong.**  In the circumstances, it's a delightful reaction.  \r  \n\r  \n*My ILs were griping about the boys and how they should have been more excited to see them than each other.* \n\nSomething deeply wrong in these people's brains and hearts, that **they can't celebrate joy** with their grandkids, that **they try to make it about them,** instead. \n\n*They asked me why I wasn't concerned with such an obsession over each other.* \n\nWhy would you be concerned?  These children are showing love and concern and the ability to have empathy and celebrate joy together.  This is wonderful.  It's not obsession, it's family being family to each other.  Obviously, **these cardboard cutouts haven't a clue how to do family with love and empathy.**  Your poor husband. \n\n*that it was wrong*\n\nNope.  **THEY are the ones doing wrong** here.  No one else.\n\n*They told me I should not be letting the boys act that way with each other.* \n\n\"letting\" them?  Celebrating with them, enjoying their joy in the achievements, what's not to be happy about?  \n\n*I told them to leave.* \n\n**Good for you.  Excellent of you.**\n\n*They complained to my husband (who was not home at the time) and he ignored them.* \n\n**He is also excellent.**  Do a bit of patting each other on the backs, for having raised delightful kids.\n\n*Then last night they sent me a bunch of messages saying the same stuff* \n\nWhat dried up old prune hearts they must have, **all obsessed with their power and control and meanness.  And now, trying to hurt you with their nastiness.**\n\n*and saying I was rude for kicking them out.* \n\nNope.  **You were protecting your children from people that are cruel and joyless** and haven't a clue what love really is.\n\n*I told them they behaved worse than my kids ever had and they needed to stop acting like children.*\n\nThat's fair.  You could have said much much worse true things.  \r  \n\r  \n*This started another tidal wave of messages from them saying I was rude* \n\n**Projection.**  They rudely dropped in.  **They rudely expected kids they've ignored to reward them** with excitement at their very presence.  **They said comment after comment that was nasty,** belittling, humiliating, mean, insulting, dismissive of true love and joy, all aimed at getting attention to them, instead of happy kids being happy together.  **The rudeness was all theirs.**  You spoke some truth to them, but it wasn't rudely done at all.\n\n*and speaking to them with \"such disrespect\".*\n\nThere are manipulators and abusers who think that they should be given the respect due to someone in authority, like a king, from us.  But we are adults, and they are adults.  They are just peers, not in authority over us.  When we talk of respect, we mean the respect between peers.  What they really mean is they want our compliance to their demands, whether they speak the demands or only hint at them.  \n\n**You were not disrespectful.  But they were, to you and your children.  And now, even more so to you.** \r  \n\r  \n*AITA?*\n\nNTA.  \n\nFor these **emotionally and verbally abusive attacks that they are now subjecting you to**, you do not have to keep on reading them or replying.  **It's okay to block them** now.  And if they \"drop in\" uninvited again, it's okay to say to them that \"our new rule is visits by invitation only.\"  And then not let them inside, as you go in and lock the door on them.  **Protecting your children is not rude.  Protecting yourself isn't rude.**", "NTA\n\nYou realize they were subtly hinting at incest, right?

It would be a good idea for this kid, he shouldn't be a constant emotional cheerleader - he should know that he's okay having feelings that aren't always positive towards his sibling now, or as he gets older. But it's entirely possible to be frustrated or sad *and* be supportive. We're not in their house, so we don't know the exact details of their dynamic.

That age gap really isn't very big, and they're both still kids. It might be harder if it was a teenager and a toddler.

Of course you can't prescribe how a child may feel, but if a child is reacting very differently to what you'd expect, you would want to change and help that. Yes it's not perfect but parents try to encourage the behaviour they expect. Therefore I think parents should be encouraging the level of care you'd expect of an 8 year old, not the one this one shows", "No, absolutely not. You can't assume that you can change your child's feelings to be the ones you want them to feel, or that the ones you expect them to have are the right ones. Life is full of the unexpected and you have to roll with the punches sometimes. First of all, every child is an individual and will have their own unique reaction to things; you can't expect everyone to develop at the same rate or in the same way. There is no one right way to be, ever. You can't always just change the things about another person, or about your life, that you don't like. Sometimes you have to accept that things won't go the way you expect them to. Honestly, there are 50 posts a week in this sub from people in blended families who totally wreck their relationship with their kids by trying to force a relationship with a step-parent or -sibling that the kid doesn't want. And it's the same exact logic that leads to parents sending their gay kids to conversion camps. You can't make people feel the way you want them to and doing that only hurts them and pushes them away.\n\nWhat a parent should be worrying about isn't whether their child lines up with what they expect. They should be worrying about whether their child is healthy and happy! If he was showing troubling behavior, aggression or anger or something, then that would be cause for alarm. But in this case what he's showing an excess of is care and empathy. That's a *good* thing. If he's REALLY excessive then maybe the parents need to talk to him about healthy boundaries, looking out for yourself and all that. But it doesn't sound like he's codependent or anything, he just loves his brother.\n\nFeelings are literally something physical in our bodies. There are specific neurons firing in our brain, sending out a particular balance of chemicals to our entire body. You *cannot deny them*. To some degree you can reason with them. But ultimately, you *need* to meet people where they are, even if it's not where you think they should be, because to do otherwise is to deny reality. And in this specific case I don't think trying to change OP's son's behavior would do anything other than damage the bond they have with each other, and potentially with the parents as well.\n\nTo attempt to put it more succinctly, if your solution to a problem starts with the word \"should\", you don't have a solution, you have a criticism.", "Sounds like now you're stuck on the ages tbh.

The fact that he ignored them tells me he\u2019s seen it and he\u2019s had it, long before this incident.", "NTA. As a grandmother myself, I would have loved seeing these brothers being so close and cheered them on for it. The fact that the older child has so much love and support for his little brother can\u2019t possibly be a bad thing. The jealousy is strong here with the grandparents. It\u2019s really baffling how often kids are more mature than adults these days.", "NTA- I\u2019m going to tell you exactly what I told my own mother when she made a similar complaint- it is not up to the child to create a relationship. It is up to the adult. If a kid reacts to you in a certain way, it is because of how you have interacted (or not interacted) with them in the past. If you don\u2019t take the time to cultivate a relationship, how can you expect anything different?", "This whole story just tells me what great parents you and your husband are. Your older son doesn\u2019t resent his little brother and the extra attention he needs for his health, he celebrates and supports him. The older is obviously secure in knowing he is loved as well. You guys just keep on doing what you\u2019re doing, loving each other. NTA", "Tbh i wouldnt be shocked if there were notes of \"Boys shouldnt love their brothers so much because it's not manly. Or they'll be *gasp* gay!\" \ud83e\udd22", "NTA -- Respect is a two-way street, and the office of [grand]parenthood does not give the ILs right-of-way/priority."]}
