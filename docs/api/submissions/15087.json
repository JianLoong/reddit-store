My oldest is 8 and my youngest is 4. The boys are very, very close and adore each other. My 4 year old son was diagnosed with epilepsy when he was 2 and it has been difficult for him. Sometimes he is so sickly he can only lounge on the couch. He needs extra monitoring. He has meds he takes. He has regular doctors visits, etc. It's a lot for a small kid. My older son was always excited and eager to be a big brother and has been so good to his brother since the diagnosis especially. They light up around each other. My oldest cheers every milestone his brother reaches and he comforts him on the bad days and celebrates his progress on the good days (the epilepsy set him back with walking for a while and on the extra bad days he needs to be carried).\n\nOur youngest had a really bad couple of weeks and was very sickly. Then yesterday he was doing better. When my older son came home from school he arrived at the same time my ILs decided to drop by for a visit. My youngest ran out to greet his brother and the oldest was so happy to see his brother back on his feet and running to him like that. They were hugging and the oldest was cheering on the youngest and my ILs... well.\n\nThe honest truth is my ILs are hardly ever around and the boys aren't the most familiar with them. So it took a few to notice them there. I went up to my ILs and they commented that the boys had a weird reaction to seeing each other since the oldest was only at school. The kids reaction to their grandparents was sort of muted but they did greet them and talk a little bit and my oldest wanted to know if he could watch some Avatar with his brother and I told him he could.\n\nMy ILs were griping about the boys and how they should have been more excited to see them than each other. They asked me why I wasn't concerned with such an obsession over each other. They said the youngest acted like they were strangers (which to him they pretty much are) and how the oldest cared more about a 4 year old than grandparents who could buy him gifts. I sort of laughed and said they were talking like they were jealous. They said it was like they weren't even there when the boys saw each other and that it was wrong and they should have gotten the running hugs and joy. They told me I should not be letting the boys act that way with each other. I told them to leave. They complained to my husband (who was not home at the time) and he ignored them. Then last night they sent me a bunch of messages saying the same stuff and saying I was rude for kicking them out. I told them they behaved worse than my kids ever had and they needed to stop acting like children.\n\nThis started another tidal wave of messages from them saying I was rude and speaking to them with \"such disrespect\".\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681816498, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12qjs1h/aita_for_telling_my_ils_they_behaved_worse_than/", "score": 820, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If they don't, that's their choice and I respect them as people with needs and feelings and things happening in their lives.\n\n*they commented that the boys had a weird reaction to seeing each other* \n\n**They are wrong.**  In the circumstances, it's a delightful reaction.  \r  \n\r  \n*My ILs were griping about the boys and how they should have been more excited to see them than each other.* \n\nSomething deeply wrong in these people's brains and hearts, that **they can't celebrate joy** with their grandkids, that **they try to make it about them,** instead. \n\n*They asked me why I wasn't concerned with such an obsession over each other.* \n\nWhy would you be concerned?  These children are showing love and concern and the ability to have empathy and celebrate joy together.  This is wonderful.  It's not obsession, it's family being family to each other.  Obviously, **these cardboard cutouts haven't a clue how to do family with love and empathy.**  Your poor husband. \n\n*that it was wrong*\n\nNope.  **THEY are the ones doing wrong** here.  No one else.\n\n*They told me I should not be letting the boys act that way with each other.* \n\n\"letting\" them?  Celebrating with them, enjoying their joy in the achievements, what's not to be happy about?  \n\n*I told them to leave.* \n\n**Good for you.  Excellent of you.**\n\n*They complained to my husband (who was not home at the time) and he ignored them.* \n\n**He is also excellent.**  Do a bit of patting each other on the backs, for having raised delightful kids.\n\n*Then last night they sent me a bunch of messages saying the same stuff* \n\nWhat dried up old prune hearts they must have, **all obsessed with their power and control and meanness.  And now, trying to hurt you with their nastiness.**\n\n*and saying I was rude for kicking them out.* \n\nNope.  **You were protecting your children from people that are cruel and joyless** and haven't a clue what love really is.\n\n*I told them they behaved worse than my kids ever had and they needed to stop acting like children.*\n\nThat's fair.  You could have said much much worse true things.  \r  \n\r  \n*This started another tidal wave of messages from them saying I was rude* \n\n**Projection.**  They rudely dropped in.  **They rudely expected kids they've ignored to reward them** with excitement at their very presence.  **They said comment after comment that was nasty,** belittling, humiliating, mean, insulting, dismissive of true love and joy, all aimed at getting attention to them, instead of happy kids being happy together.  **The rudeness was all theirs.**  You spoke some truth to them, but it wasn't rudely done at all.\n\n*and speaking to them with \"such disrespect\".*\n\nThere are manipulators and abusers who think that they should be given the respect due to someone in authority, like a king, from us.  But we are adults, and they are adults.  They are just peers, not in authority over us.  When we talk of respect, we mean the respect between peers.  What they really mean is they want our compliance to their demands, whether they speak the demands or only hint at them.  \n\n**You were not disrespectful.  But they were, to you and your children.  And now, even more so to you.** \r  \n\r  \n*AITA?*\n\nNTA.  \n\nFor these **emotionally and verbally abusive attacks that they are now subjecting you to**, you do not have to keep on reading them or replying.  **It's okay to block them** now.  And if they \"drop in\" uninvited again, it's okay to say to them that \"our new rule is visits by invitation only.\"  And then not let them inside, as you go in and lock the door on them.  **Protecting your children is not rude.  Protecting yourself isn't rude.**", "NTA\n\nYou realize they were subtly hinting at incest, right? All because they didn't get worshipped?\n\nIt's very telling that they also view the value of their relationships with what can be got out of it, i.e. the gift comments.\n\nThese are not people you want around your kids. They will 100% try to drive them apart.", "People who are respected have usually done something to earn it. \n\nAdditionally, how often are they around *ANY* kid? They seem to have a really skewed idea of how one behaves. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "So they have said what they expect their grandchildren to be, givers of praise and love into their sad old lives because no one else is doing it, and they're too egoistic or dense to realize they cause it themselves.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You sound like a great mother who is raising two great young men. It would have been so easy to ignore or brush off their inappropriate comments and carry on but you had a strong enough spine to call them on it and kick them out. I feel sorry for your ILs and their demented thoughts process. I'm curious if your partner had siblings or not and what their relationship was like as children.", "Definitely NTA. As a child I always hated being coerced into showing physical affection or having to fake enthusiasm for people I didn\u2019t really even know. It\u2019s not a child\u2019s job to make a grown-ass adult feel validated! It\u2019s important to teach your children about bodily autonomy and that they are responsible for their own actions and emotions and not those of others. The only thing your kids \u201cowe\u201d to guests in your home, regardless of the relationship, is courtesy. And I didn\u2019t see any indication whatsoever that they behaved rudely.", "omg  i love the love they have for each other!!!! NTA btw sheesh", "NTA, your inlaws are awful and immature. Keep on protecting and nurturing your sons bond and don't let anyone teach you anything about your own children.  \nThe audacity of the grand-parents, please !", "Your ILs aside, while the youngest is sick, I hope you don\u2019t let the older brother do everything and focus on him too.", "Does your husband have siblings? If so what is their relationship like? I think this might explain a lot.", "NTA for sure. It sounds like your boys have a lovely relationship, have your ILs ever reacted like this before?? Weird way to react to loving brothers who don't know them very well. It also sounds like you're also making sure your oldest has a life of his own and still chooses to be there for his brother, so I think you're great parents of wonderful kids <3", "This type of thing is exactly why we don\u2019t have contact with either side of our families. NTA. You\u2019re doing a great job and it\u2019s refreshing to see siblings be so loving and encouraging to each other.", "In now way shape or form are you an asshole. Op this is parenting done right!! This was a heartwarming read (other than your sad excuses for in laws) you an your husband sound like wonderful parents and your sons sound like treasures! \nNta!", "NTA- Especially not for raising kids who prioritize their siblings' wellbeing over people \"who could buy him gifts\". Is there any way we could encourage that fine young man into politics, and could he be persuaded to do so in England? It'd be worth the wait from my POV to have at least one person in charge whose principles couldn't be bought...", "NTA. Your ILs can go F themselves and that high horse they keep riding around on.  The fact that your kids love each other so much is so freaking adorable! Never let them lose that spark. I know siblings that delight in tormenting each other (not in that funny way only siblings can, but straight hatred) and seeing affection between siblings is great.", "NTA. My father has always complained that my (now grown) children never call him or stop by for a visit. well, of course they don't Dad, you have been telling them to sit down and be quiet for over 20 years! Who wants to go hang out with someone like that?!?", "NTA. That\u2019s bond is beautiful but can anyone explain what sickly means?", "My paternal grandmother was like this. She use to whine and complain how she never saw us and how we never showed her excitement or joy when we did. As a small child I remember my parents coaching us to act excited when we see her. We were told to run out and yell for her every single time. I didn't realize until I was an adult how batshit crazy that was. NTA one bit.", "\"waaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh this eight year old doesn't wanna be my friend, make 'im be my friennnnnnnnnnnnd you MEANINE!\"\n\nFucking losers, NTA", "Disconnected old heads act like the fragile snowflakes they accuse the younger gen of being lmao nta", "NTA. This is narcissism. My FIL behaves like this and guess what? We've never allowed him to even meet our kids. Presents aren't the way to a child's heart. Prescence IS. What they just witnessed is what happens when someone meets a love language need and someone doesn't.", "Nta your boys sound so sweet. I love that they have such love for one another. Your inlaws are being ridiculous.", "To me, it\u2019s quite the tell that when they complained to OPs husband, he just went on and utterly ignored them.", ">it's really sweet how supportive your eldest **(who is only 8)** is with his younger brother.\n\nI\u2019m glad you highlighted that he\u2019s only 8 because I think that\u2019s why it\u2019s actually more concerning than sweet. At the age of 8 he surely shouldn\u2019t be that invested in his brother\u2019s illness or get so much joy from him being back on his feet. I mean at the age of 8 just think about how young that child is to be involved with this.", "Best wishes on your surgery and recovery.", "I completely agree with you. It's sad to see grandparents who only focus on the materialistic aspect of their relationship with their grandchildren. They should be happy to see the boys loving and caring for each other, not jealous of them. And you're right, their behavior is very immature. NTA.", "I'm getting right-wing vibes. Letting brothers hug is grooming them to be gay after all, didn't you know?", "> It\u2019s really weird that they insist that the boys shouldn\u2019t love each other.\n\nI'm guessing the closest thing those two have ever come to love was when they inserted the stick.", "Love that super cute hope whenever I have kids their like that with eachother!", "Are you saying it\u2019s weird he cares about his brother? Even more so, his sick brother who\u2019s FINALLY feeling better again after a few weeks?? \n\nWhen are children supposed to start caring for others??\ud83d\ude2c", "involved with...his younger brother's wellbeing? is this satire\n\nit's nice to see siblings who get along so well and actually like *and* love each other and you think it's weird because the eldest is \"only 8\" like? if ur baby brother has been sick half his life you are going to be happy to see him bounce back after 2 weeks of being ill. they live in the same house. they hang out after school. it would be concerning if he didn't care about his brother's health (and related limitations?) and only cared about his games or whatever. what fresh hell", ">at the age of 8 just think about how young that child is to be involved with this.\n\nAre you serious? Putting responsibility on kids, or ignoring them in favor of another family member, is bad. But they know when things are wrong, and it's better that they understand what's going on in an age-appropriate manner. Otherwise it's scary.\n\nMy dad had a blood clot in his spine and was suddenly paralyzed when we were kids. He eventually regained the ability to walk, but it was a long, long road involving a stay in physical rehab. It was a whole big thing. We went to PT appointments and cheered on my dad on, and were so excited when he did. It made us feel less helpless.\n\nAs for epilepsy specifically, I developed it at age 15. It's not a thing you can separate from family life, you're going to be sick & have doctor's appointments, possibly always. Everyone is going to be involved. If kiddo felt responsible for his brother's care, that's one thing. OP should make sure that her healthy kid's needs aren't shunted aside. My sister would help me out, but she never was pressured by herself or others - I checked in with her about it both then and when we were adults, and she's VERY up front about her boundaries. Help with homework? Yes. Holding my head when my meds made me throw up? Nope, but she'd bring me Gatorade after.\n\nWith these kids, it just sounds like he's just glad that his brother is having a good day. It sucks so bad to see someone you love in that situation, and you treasure the good days when you find them. I don't mean to come down on you hard, but this is reality for us on both sides of the fence - as much as you want to shelter the younger members of your family from rough stuff, you can't always.", ">you can\u2019t just tell a kid to love you cause you\u2019re their grandma. \n\nExcept the kid you're sticking up for here does seem to love his brother just because he's his brother.", "What is wrong with you?", "This is...an odd take. They are siblings. Unconditional love exists. Why does their relationship need to be transactional? It sounds like the older brother is simply happy to be there and spend time with his little brother, so what doesn't make sense?", "You guys are amazing parents and your boys are lucky to have such a wonderful, loving and supportive family!", "Thank you! I\u2019m very nervous", "Seriously? Jeez it says nothing about that and everything about how self-absorbed the OP's ILs are. That kind of AH-ery knows no political bounds.", "Children learn to care for others at an age younger than 8, yes, but this is a bit beyond caring for others. This is supporting the younger brother through the hard times and being very very proud and happy when the younger one is getting through it. \n\nFor that, you need to be much more emotionally developed than 8. I mean think about yourself when you were 8. Can you really imagine slotting that 8 year old you into this post\u2019s situation and it acting the same way as the older brother is here? This reminds me of one of my sisters. She went through something similar, supporting her partner through a health problem. Can I imagine her 8 year old self doing the exact same? No I can\u2019t.", "I do think the 8 year old should be able to care about his brother\u2019s health. But the care would be as much as sad that the brother is out of action and then happy when he\u2019s back. What\u2019s described here though is supporting the brother through all the bad times and being invested in every little milestone. That\u2019s more than just caring about his brother\u2019s health.", "How? They\u2019ve grown up together and developed a relationship by living together and being close, not just he being related.", "What do you mean? If you tell me why you think someone\u2019s wrong with me I can explain but I\u2019m not sure what you mean right now.", "Well, I always get the more experimental ones. The most interesting one was bubblegum, orange and mint flavors lol. My husband loves chocolate flavors and my son loves citrus flavors. He also has a soft spot for raspberry flavor too.", "It's \"grandchildren are our reward and are there for us to spoil\" taken to its logical extreme conclusion. The kids stop being living things and turn into cardboard cutouts designed to play a specific role.", "I was specifically referring to them acting like it was weird for brothers to be close and hug each other. The rest of it is just them being self absorbed assholes, yes.", "\u201cOh no - it\u2019s the consequences of my own actions\u201d\n\nYour in-laws are odd, you seem like a good parent, don\u2019t let this rattle you. How did your partner take it?", "So the thing that concerns you is that he's developing emotionally faster than he should? What do you think the parents should do differently then? Emotional development is shaped by our lived experiences and his lived experience is that he has a brother who he loves that is sometimes too ill to even walk. It's maybe unfortunate that he has to be aware of things like this at his age but it's even more unfortunate that his brother is sick at all. It's an unfair situation and thinking about the way things \"should\" be doesn't help them change reality. That's life sometimes.\n\nYou can't just plop an 8 year old version of your sister into a thought experiment and use that as the barometer of what's normal. She's a different person, with a different life. Who knows how she would have handled this situation at 8 if it was something she'd been aware of for a full quarter of her life?", "are you really policing the lived emotions of an 8 year old. that's weird", "Wtf are you talking about?", "I mean it's his brother. They live together, he sees how he's doing on a day to day basis. Of course he's emotionally invested... his brother's illness effects the entire family, him included. What's the problem with him being excited about something that impacts not only his brother's life, but also his own?", "Yes they\u2019ve grown up together but in the mere 4 years of that happening, the younger brother has hardly been able to do anything that\u2019s earned love or bring himself closer to his older brother.", "The boys have a close relationship.
