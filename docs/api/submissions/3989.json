I truly don\u2019t know why it\u2019s become such a sticking point.\n\nI (28F) have two nieces (8 & 5) from my sister (38F). They\u2019re my only family, but I\u2019ve never been super close to my sister or our mom (63F), so I\u2019m not super close to the kids. Even less so when I moved 6.5 hours away a few years ago, and they live in the same city. I only see any of them during Christmas, a week over the summer, and one weekend trip close to the girls\u2019 birthdays. They\u2019re good kids, I love them and have fun with them, but we just aren\u2019t that close.\n\nA month ago I asked my sister what the kids wanted for Christmas and she said she was finally relenting on their wish for tablets, but asked if I could get them because both her and mom are tech incompetent, while I\u2019m a software engineer. So I said cool- got a tablet, headphones, and a large squishamallow for each of them. Got good deals all around, so I only spent $125 on each kid.\n\nThe problem came up because I also saw one of those \u201cpick a kid off the tree\u201d charities, where you buy gifts for low income children. I had always wanted to participate, and since it\u2019s the first year I\u2019m not a broke grad student, I thought, why not!\n\nPicked a 10 year old girl who wanted books, science kits, and board games. And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just because I\u2019m passionate about girls in STEM or also love reading and board games, but I found myself getting so excited to shop for this kid. Ended up getting like 20 presents- a mix of board games, science kits, clothes, a skateboard, brain puzzles, journaling kit, and a bookstore gift card. Took advantage of Thanksgiving deals, spent about $250 for $350 worth of presents.\n\nWell, we share an Amazon account and I guess they saw all the purchases, assumed it was for my nieces, and called to ask. When I explained, they were both so upset with me? They said that they aren\u2019t able to get the kids much this year (both teachers), and if I had that kind of money, I should be spending it on family instead of some random kid I will never know. I hadn\u2019t really thought about the fact that I don't actually know this kid, but retorted that my nieces have three adults buying them gifts, while this kid might only get presents from the charity.\n\nWe argued in circles, they accused me of being cold / not really loving my nieces, and hung up in a huff. But have been pestering me about it over text for a week now. I feel like I\u2019m missing some unspoken social cue and being punished for doing a nice thing??", "created_utc": 1670207693, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcuaht/aita_for_spending_so_much_more_on_a_kid_i_dont/", "score": 45, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
