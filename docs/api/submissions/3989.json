I truly don\u2019t know why it\u2019s become such a sticking point.\n\nI (28F) have two nieces (8 & 5) from my sister (38F). They\u2019re my only family, but I\u2019ve never been super close to my sister or our mom (63F), so I\u2019m not super close to the kids. Even less so when I moved 6.5 hours away a few years ago, and they live in the same city. I only see any of them during Christmas, a week over the summer, and one weekend trip close to the girls\u2019 birthdays. They\u2019re good kids, I love them and have fun with them, but we just aren\u2019t that close.\n\nA month ago I asked my sister what the kids wanted for Christmas and she said she was finally relenting on their wish for tablets, but asked if I could get them because both her and mom are tech incompetent, while I\u2019m a software engineer. So I said cool- got a tablet, headphones, and a large squishamallow for each of them. Got good deals all around, so I only spent $125 on each kid.\n\nThe problem came up because I also saw one of those \u201cpick a kid off the tree\u201d charities, where you buy gifts for low income children. I had always wanted to participate, and since it\u2019s the first year I\u2019m not a broke grad student, I thought, why not!\n\nPicked a 10 year old girl who wanted books, science kits, and board games. And I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just because I\u2019m passionate about girls in STEM or also love reading and board games, but I found myself getting so excited to shop for this kid. Ended up getting like 20 presents- a mix of board games, science kits, clothes, a skateboard, brain puzzles, journaling kit, and a bookstore gift card. Took advantage of Thanksgiving deals, spent about $250 for $350 worth of presents.\n\nWell, we share an Amazon account and I guess they saw all the purchases, assumed it was for my nieces, and called to ask. When I explained, they were both so upset with me? They said that they aren\u2019t able to get the kids much this year (both teachers), and if I had that kind of money, I should be spending it on family instead of some random kid I will never know. I hadn\u2019t really thought about the fact that I don't actually know this kid, but retorted that my nieces have three adults buying them gifts, while this kid might only get presents from the charity.\n\nWe argued in circles, they accused me of being cold / not really loving my nieces, and hung up in a huff. But have been pestering me about it over text for a week now. I feel like I\u2019m missing some unspoken social cue and being punished for doing a nice thing??\n\n\\--\n\nEdit: Glad to know that I'm definitely not an ass in this situation, and that people are more concerned with the shared Amazon account. \ud83d\ude02 I'll definitely get my own after this. My mom got it years ago, and my sister and I only used it occasionally, until it just kinda grew into a family account. Same with Netflix and Disney, but those don't have my credit card info on them...\n\nI'll still be gifting the tablets to my nieces, they're blameless in this. It's just always something with my mom and sister.

I can't believe they resent gifts for a low income child.", "Nta. You\u2019re an angel who just created an unforgettable Christmas for someone. Bless your heart. How any person but especially a PARENT could be upset about that, I cannot wrap my head around. Shame on your family for guilting you.", "NTA you did a lovely thing, the more you do for the disadvantaged, and for the community, the better person you are. Also, your nieces didn't ask for those things, you gave them everything they asked for, definitely NTA. you're a very good person", "NTA. I've got grandkids getting a bunch from us. But we also picked a 10 year old Lego loving boy from the angel tree. I know what it's like to not be able to make Christmas for your kids- what a blessing you are.", "NTA this is really nice of you! I can\u2019t afford Xmas this year and it\u2019s been hard since my mom passed in April, I\u2019d never behave like that. My kids aren\u2019t entitled to my siblings or relatives money just because they\u2019re related. I\u2019m thankful for anything they get.", "NTA. Criticizing you for spending for an unfortunate child is just tacky.", "NTA - your sister and mom are", "I agree with all of this. NTA, OP.", "Depends on if they know OP can afford it, and how freely she's inclined to spend as a general rule; I don't have a ton of money, but I've offered to pay for a friend to get some art that was about in that price range, for instance.  \n\nAlso, it may have been discussed beforehand; as an example, the mother of one of my partners gave me a particular spending limit for the stuff she was going to get for me. It turned out I was able to get about five hardcover books for about $50, due to when she asked, even though I'd normally consider that too much because ordinarily it would be significantly more than that. The tablets might be a similar situation.", "Great point on the other tree kids. I'll keep that in mind for next year!", "I guess I'm just comparing my family to others I grew up around, and feel like I'm not that aunt that goes to your ball games, recitals, etc. I do face time them every two or three months while catching up with my sister. They don't talk for long, because they're kids, but seem engaged. So maybe \"not super close\" is a bit of an exaggeration on my part.", "Not to mention gift cards can be used for things other than the kids, or traded more easily for drugs and things (my sister has done this). Niche interests or things specific to the kid are a little harder. Its why if I get my niece nice things, I customize it to make it harder to sell/trade. Ill add her name on it (nicely, not sharpie) or things to make it less desirable as a resell.", "No, please don't! Teach them the way. Tell the kids that you are picking out gifts for a child that needs them. Have them help pick out a few things and a book or game for each other. \n\nIt could be a new thing to have them help you pick out things for the tree of giving and each other. Teach them to give.", "I love this idea! Don't know how I'd coordinate with living away, but I know there's something similar in my hometown/ where they live. I'll figure that out for next year!", "No kid needs more than a fire, end stop. They are $50 lol.", "https://www.wealthysinglemommy.com/free-christmas-gifts/", "NTA\n\nThe tablets are MORE than generous. They are being entitled but it's not up to them how much you choose to give charitably. It's simply not their money and it's weird AF that they are acting like it is.", "NTA.  I always love how people feel entitled to other's money, especially family.  You already got a major purchase out of the way for you nieces that mom and grandma couldn't handle, and it is your money to do with as you please.", "They told you what they wanted and you gave it! I love what you did for this little girl and when she goes on to win a Nobel one day and talks about how her love of it all started when some lovely stranger gifted her a big box of opportunities for learning you can know the investment paid off! Yeah ok so we don\u2019t know that she will go on to win a Nobel but I think we do all know that she will be so incredibly grateful for those gifts and she will use them and learn and very hopefully inspire herself to a much better future. Those are not just Christmas presents you are giving. You are giving her hope and inspiration and compassion and a chance to escape. NTA at all and it\u2019s a shame your family can\u2019t see that if they are getting kids that young tablets then they really are pretty damn wealthy already.", "NTA!\n\nYou\u2019re not doing anything bad to your nieces. They both got GREAT, expensive gifts and unless your sister and mom have infected them with their entitled attitude they would probably be super happy to share in their good fortune with another kid who doesn\u2019t have a generous aunt. \n\nI\u2019m sorry that the shitty adults are ruining what could have been a great Christmas with their entitlement and jealousy. \n\nAlso, one thing I hate is people who pocket watch. If they want to be so involved in your finances, let them make some of those student loan payments.", "NTA", "All of this. OP, get your own Amazon account. Send your nieces their gifts, and keep in mind just how entitled your mom and sister are. THIS is who they are.", "OP got the niece's exactly what was asked for (tablets) and then even more (accessories and a toy) and the family is mad that it is not enough?!?!?!\n\nOP is a good person, and I hope that the sister and the mother get their heads out of their asses.", "Wow. That's heartbreaking. Could the charity give out info like that?\n\nMy family is donating gifts instead of giving me presents (this is what I wanted for the winter holiday). We picked out a \"soon to age out\" girl from a group home. Now I'm wondering if I should call and see if she has younger siblings also in the home or who she has access to and grab the littles something, if she does have any.", "I mean honestly, that is why I wince whenever I read of people buying brand new bikes for kids on these lists. Like that is super nice and all but so easy to resell or return to the store. Plus, honestly, even low income children do not need a brand new bike. I never had one, just hand me downs or from yard sales and such.\n\nWe did an angel tree this year and we got her some new sneakers, a light zip up jacket, and a couple toys. I figure hopefully the parent would not sell shoes or a jacket that kiddo could actually use, especially because they weren't too expensive", "Do it! They can pick out things online for a tag they get. \n\nAs far as mom and sister, I'd just assume they were stressed and not being honest about the money pressures of inflation... they saw all that stuff and thought it was a Christmas miracle. They they lost their minds... but if old scrooge can change, they can too.\n\nI'd just send them an email. Tell them you didn't realize they were feeling so stressed about the holidays. That you understand, but that doesn't change your plan to help someone less fortunate.\n\n Going forward, you'd like the nibblings to help pick out gifts for those less fortunate and each other every year as a new family tradition. This year, they can help by making cards to include in your gifts and picking out something for each other under $20."]}
