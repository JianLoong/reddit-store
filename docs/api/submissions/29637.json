{"id": 29637, "submission_id": "17g77c9", "title": "AITA for telling my vegan sister she can't serve only vegan food at our family reunion?", "selftext": "Hey all, I'm genuinely torn about this and need some clarity.\n\nEvery year, our family has a reunion where different members host. This year, it's my younger sister's turn. She's been vegan for about 3 years and is quite passionate about it. We all respect her choices and make sure there are a good variety of vegan options whenever we have family gatherings.\n\nWhen she announced she'll be hosting, she also said that the entire menu would be vegan to align with her beliefs and that it's a chance for the family to try something different. Some family members were excited, but others, including many of the older folks, were pretty upset and felt like they were being forced into her lifestyle, even if just for one meal.\n\nI spoke to her privately and asked if she'd be open to including a few non-vegan dishes for those who aren't keen on a full vegan menu. She got quite defensive, saying this was her chance to showcase veganism and that for one meal, everyone can give it a go.\n\nI respect her beliefs, but I also think that forcing an entire family to adopt her choices, even if just for one meal, isn't fair. She's now upset with me for not being supportive and says I'm not respecting her choices.\n\nAITA?\n\nUPDATE:wow! lots of good thoughts! ,thought I would answer a couple questions here so they're not lost in the comments:\n\n1. There is no set rota, the hosting goes to whoever wants to host most / hasn't hosted before, in this case she wanted to host\n2. We have managed to come to a compromise where people can bring their own food as long as it doesn't contain meat, which I think is fair.\n3. just for some more context, she works at a well known UK fast food place, so has no issues handling / preparing / serving meat, although I get that this can be different at home.", "created_utc": 1698247168, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17g77c9/aita_for_telling_my_vegan_sister_she_cant_serve/", "score": 8457, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I wouldn\u2019t attempt to cook meat for someone. I wouldn\u2019t even know where to start. I\u2019d order food with meat in it or I would be fine with someone bringing a meat dish they prepared. Everyone has different comfort levels with meat and with vegan food. \n\nOn the meat eaters side, some vegan food can upset their stomachs if they aren\u2019t used to imitation products. \nOn the vegan side, I\u2019m not comfortable handling raw meat and that\u2019s pretty reasonable to not ask her to do it. \n\nIt\u2019s one meal, a compromise shouldn\u2019t be this hard.", "Have to go with YTA. It's one meal, and she'll be serving food that everyone can eat, and it's perfectly possible for her to be an amazing host without catering to people's *preference* for meat dishes.\n\nIf a friend whose religion forbids pork invites me to their place for breakfast, the fact there's no bacon with my pancakes isn't them forcing their beliefs onto me. But if I asked them to provide bacon because it's my preference, I'd for sure be disrespecting their beliefs.", "NAH but this is totally on you guys, not on her. You guys apparently had agreed that she should be the next host and Vegans have an ethical stance against purchasing animal products for any reason, so I\u2019m not sure what was expected from this. If you wanted animal products to be served I don\u2019t know why you all agreed on her being allowed to host in the first place. Asking her to pay for and serve animal products is asking her to compromise her morals and her beliefs, it\u2019s just shitty.", "Honestly, I think YTA. Not in a big way, I get it\u2019s not what you usually look forward to or are used to with meals. But it\u2019s one meal! I grew up with two vegetarian friends (whole family) and when they had me over, even as a kid, I knew I shouldn\u2019t expect or ask for meat.\n\nYou say you respect her beliefs, but want her to go against them for you all in her own home. Veganism is based on a strongly held personal belief related to their morals, and in that way is similar to religion. You wouldn\u2019t go somewhere a Muslim is hosting and expect them to still serve pork to you because YOU love and eat it. You\u2019re asking her to put aside her beliefs for your taste. \n\nThere is still tons of variety and delicious options with vegan food! So so much! Be more open-minded to something different for one meal. If you really expect to just completely hate any meal with no animal products, smash a burger before hand and politely pick at whatever looks best when you\u2019re there.", "She's catering and ensuring that everyone has something they *can* eat (allowing for allergies, dietary requirements etc) even if it isn't what they'd *normally* eat. \n\nI've worked in catering and have frequently heard \"oh no, I don't want that it's vegan\". One free sample later and they've chosen to order that same menu item, despite non-vegan items being available. It's just prejudice. \n\nYour family sound like they're being very closed minded. They can go without animal products for one meal, it won't hurt them, and nor do they have an ethical position which mandates eating animal products at every meal. \n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nSuck it up for one meal.  I am not a vegan nor any form of vegetarian. However, sometimes we do things for people we love.  Eating a meal made from someone you love, surrounded by people you love, is a pretty easy sacrifice to make.  \n\nIf this family reunion is Thanksgiving, then I would definitely have some honey baked ham and turkey ready for me for when I get home!  Yeah, and all the sides too.", "NAH. She is ensuring everyone has something to eat and unless she is stopping people from bringing meat into her home, she is not *forcing* her views/diet on others. She is just putting a barrier at what she is comfortable cooking. However, others have made food they are not accustomed to, for her, so I get that they might feel like they are not being respected the same way they respected her diet.  You were just bringing their feelings to her attention. Neither is an asshole thing to do or feel.", "Oh, come on.  It's not like vegans eat only lima beans and onions.  Is your sister in charge of the food?  If you didn't want a vegan person to make all the food, you should have picked someone else.  You can't expect a vegan to make beef stew.  People will absolutely live after eating a vegan meal.  You know what's a vegan meal?  Pasta and red sauce without meatballs.  Served with french bread and oil for dipping.  You have eaten lots of vegan meals in your life without realizing it.  Peanut butter and jelly.  Life will continue, and most people won't even notice that everything is vegan.", "YTA. It's one meal and she's hosting. People act like vegan meals come from Martian farms via teleportation. It's literally just everything you eat except for the meat, dairy, and eggs. Honey of you're going to be weird about it. It's like someone says the word \"vegan\" and people forget they have been eating vegetables and fruits for years. Oreos are vegan. \n\nThere will probably be a fruit tray, some vegetables and dips and some larger family style dishes.  If you are interested in being helpful, let her know some things you think will be crowd pleasers. A burrito bar? Baked beans? Grilled vegetables? \n\nIf anyone is upset they can do whatever vegans have done for decades and bring a little something for themselves or eat before or after.\n\nEdit: if you want to offer some good faith help, remind your sister that a lot of people are sensitive to soy and that she will want to label any food that has unexpected ingredients so nobody eats anything they're allergic to.", "YTA, it's one meal. Okay, fair enough if she spends the entire reunion as a lecture on veganism and actively tries to make her guests feel guilty, that would be wrong. But it's a vegan hosted party, I really don't see the wrong in her show casing vegan food there as everyone can eat it? The logic of, \"we accommodate your diet why not ours?\" isn't as sound as you think it is - her diet has to be accommodated for as her diet doesn't conform to the norms, she wouldn't have anything to eat if nobody actively thought to. Whereas, everybody CAN eat what she's offering, they just don't want to.\n\nI honestly just think this is more about it being 'vegan' than anything else. When I worked in a pub we would write up new beers on chalkboard menus, I remember changing the sign to a new beer, the same guy who had bought it earlier and liked it, came in a couple days later after I had added to the chalkboard 'vegan' (I'd forgotten when I first changed it and updated it later), he must've forgotten he'd already tried it and absolutely baulked at the idea of a vegan beer haha! Same thing when I used to hand out free hot meals for Food Not Bombs, which if you don't know is an organisation that uses binned food from supermarkets to use up otherwise 'wasted' food from being sent to landmills. Had a couple people happy enough to grab a free bowl knowing it was from a bin but as soon as I said vegan would put it down again haha\n\nIt's one meal though, it really won't hurt your family to try out her food!", "NTA I feel like if she was hosting her own get together then the menu is the menu but when you\u2019re hosting an annual whole family thing like a reunion you should host with everyone in mind. If the entire family makes sure there are options for her I feel like she should show them the same courtesy.", "INFO: Does the host always prepare 100% of the menu, or do people usually bring sides/desserts?  Is she amenable to that?\n\nI wouldn't ask a vegan to prepare non-vegan food, but I think she's being unreasonable if she's preventing other people from bringing their own dishes.  At reunions I've attended and heard about, food is a very important component (and because I live in the South, it's often pretty unhealthy and delicious), so yeah, preventing Uncle Chuck from bringing his famous shrimp-stuffed jalapenos or asking Grandma to figure out how to make her chocolate icebox pies vegan would be a recipe for sadness and resentment.\n\nReserving judgment until I know more.", "YTA - she\u2019s not forcing a lifestyle on you, she\u2019s hosting and cooking. She happens to be vegan so she\u2019s a cooking a plant-based menu. \n\nDoes your sister comment on everyone\u2019s menu when they host? Do you all do this all the time or is it just because it\u2019s \u201cvegan\u201d. You guys can go without meat product for 1 meal", "NTA, folks expect certain kinds of things at big family get togethers and barbecues, and it's the worst when all the good stuff won't be there because of a vegan host insists on not being left out of the hosting rotation.\n\nIt's only the past few years now that Beyond and Impossible are at least capable of tasting close enough to meat for burgers unlike those old horrible bean burgers.\n\n  I know the new ones have beans but they actually work well enough to get me to buy the packages when they're on sale and treat them the same as the ground beef I use.  I'm by no means vegetarian, but I try stuff and if it works I'll keep using it.", "NTA if it were the other way around most of the comments would be about accommodating her and how even one meal should be something she can eat etc etc.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s wrong for her to try to force others into something that they\u2019re not comfortable with. I\u2019m sure everyone provides accommodations for her when she visits, so I don\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t extend the courtesy.\n\nIf she doesn\u2019t want to handle the food herself, she can at least offer for others to bring a dish they\u2019d enjoy or she can order something already made.", "Nta just don\u2019t provide her vegatarian options in the future", "NTA, and I say that as a vegetarian.  I would not feel comfortable preparing meat dishes but I would extend the offer that anyone who wants to prepare and bring some can.\n\nEveryone accommodates her dietary choices and doesn't give her a hard time for her beliefs, right?  She can certainly extend the same courtesy.\n\nThe way I see it, eating meat is normal part of the natural order of things.  I just personally choose not to because it makes me happy.  That's my choice for what I feel is best for me.  But I won't condemn others for choosing to eat it.  Hell, I literally have no other vegetarians/vegans in my life.  But like you, my family considers me when planning get togethers.  They'll often have vegetarian dishes available and have no issue if I make something myself to bring (and when I do I make enough for everyone to try but am not offended if they don't).\n\nAs the host, it's her duty to be hospitable and considerate of the needs and preferences of her guests, within reason.  Offer to help out and provide the meat dishes if she'll just agree to allowing them to be served.", "YTA. It's one freaking meal. I'm not vegan, but if someone - anyone - wants to host and cook whole a meal for me and my fam, I'd be thrilled.   \n\n\nwinner winner vegan dinner", "YTA. She is hosting, so it is her house, her rules.  She isnt starving people or forcing them to eat anything that goes against their beliefs.  One meal without animal products is perfectly nutritious.  Hopefully your family will learn something, as they enjoy veggie platters, hummus, fruits and nuts, pasta with red sauce and creamy sauces, veggie burgers with toppings, oreos, frozen desserts, etc.", "YTA. Is there some reason you think you absolutely have to eat animal products in every single meal? As long as she's accommodating anyone else's restrictions, she's in the clear. \n\nAs a dedicated vegan, she probably knows the tricks to make vegan dishes that don't even taste vegan and you wouldn't guess if you didn't know in advance.", "I went to an all vegan Thanksgiving dinner once. I wasn\u2019t looking forward to it because I love a traditional Thanksgiving dinner. However, it turned out to be a fabulous meal, which everyone thoroughly enjoyed. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re missing until you try it and it\u2019s only one meal if you hate it, you can stop by Bob\u2019s Big Burgers on the way home.", "was leaning towards NAH until the very end when she became an asshole. She has no right to be upset for a reason like this. NTA. Tell her to quit being an asshole just because you voiced your opinion.", "I would literally just pass on this year's even. I'm nit going to an all vegan reunion. Thats like a bunch of different foods. It's like the main event of the occasion all through the occasion. Nah, not going.", "People that have a problem with it could always just bring their own dishes if they don\u2019t want to eat vegan meals. Which, by the way, vegan meals can be pretty amazing with the right spices and a good chef. \n\nI just can\u2019t imagine a scenario where it would be ok if at the next family gathering all you cooked was meat and told her \u201cit\u2019s only one meal, you can give meat a go\u201d and the double standard makes me petty. So NTA for me.", "NAH maybe N T A. Depending on what you mean by \u201cdefensive\u201d I don\u2019t think anyone is wrong for requesting meat options but I also don\u2019t think she\u2019s in the wrong for refusing. If you want a meat option you can bring one for yourself or plan a meal before/after accordingly.\n\nI\u2019m sure there is always someone who has to \u201csuck it up\u201d based off the type of food available at every family reunion and most of the time it would be impossible to accommodate everyone\u2019s preferences/wants/needs.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to want alternatives to just vegan meals, but I don\u2019t think I\u2019d rely on a vegan host to make the accommodation for a multitude of reasons.", "NTA\n\nIf y\u2019all cater to her dietary preferences she should cater to yours.

Plenty of substitutes can land afoul of other people\u2019s dietary requirements.", "NTA\n\n\nI was on a limited diet for over 6 years (meaning no beef, no pork, nor any red meat). That was MY decision. I never forced others to eat the same way I did because that is a personal choice. I don't like steaks, my family loves them. I do me and they do they. They eat any chance they have, I don't. When we are at my house, if they wish they can bring their own. If possible, there will be an option of their preference provided by myself. Why? Because that is being a good host. Also because while I didn't ear ANYTHING of beer and pork, they all made sure that I had more options when they hosted and it is a way to reciprocate on their attentions. \n\n\nYour sister is being a dick. The only thing that will come out of this is that some of your family on next gatherings won't provide options for her and it will be well earned. She is in for a rude awakening. You can't treat others this way and expect they will remain to be considerate towards you.", "YTA. It\u2019s one meal. Nobody needs to eat animal products at every meal. It\u2019s not forcing anything. You don\u2019t choose the menu when you go to a party at someone\u2019s house. I\u2019m pretty sure she could lie and say some things weren\u2019t vegan and none of you would know the difference.

I can\u2019t see a problem if she\u2019s the one providing the food. The other option is to not have the vegan host a food event. I\u2019ve been vegan for a very long time and I would never host a food event but if I did the food would all be 100% vegan. It would be delicious but I also know not everyone would be willing to try it and that\u2019s their choice. But I could never buy or cook or have meat or dairy or eggs in my own home or in my kitchen, I just couldn\u2019t so I hope my family and friends would know better than to ask me to host\u2026 because everyone in my family and friend circle knows any food I am providing is going to be vegan, no exceptions. \n\nOn the flip side of that, I don\u2019t expect people to have vegan options for me and I would hope they know that\u2019s not something they have to do.", "Kind of shocked by the number of Y T A judgements. OP didn\u2019t do anything AHish by asking if \u201cshe would be open to\u201d having some non vegan options. She did it to make the host aware of potential problems because, as we know, older family members tend to get hostile when things aren\u2019t the way they want. She\u2019s in no way saying things have to be a certain way, she\u2019s just trying to have a family gathering without conflict.\n\nClearly NTA", "NTA, but your sister is a huge one. \n\nIf it was her wedding, her birthday party, any other event that is about her, then she would have all right to choose only vegan menu. \n\nBut this event isn\u2019t about her, it is family reunion, it is about all of family members. She is just a temporary host for this year. All previous hosts respect her lifestyle and provide vegan options. If it confronts her beliefs and she doesn\u2019t want to prepare / have non-vegan food, it\u2019s absolutely okay. Then she should miss her turn as a host and go for party that will host someone else and gives her vegan options as usual. It would be best solution for all. \n\nBut this is not about her own principles and beliefs. She explicitly makes it about forcing other people to do things they don\u2019t want to. She want to \u201cshowcase veganism\u201d, not happy family meeting. Jerk move, imo. \n\nFinally, when some conservative older family members don\u2019t attend reunion / start complain and arguing on the reunion/ \u2026 it will be completely your sister\u2019s fault.

She wants people to prepare vegan dishes for her when they host, but she does not want to offer non-vegan dishes for others when she hosts. In other words, you have to accommodate her dietary preferences, but she doesn't have to accommodate yours. I could see her not wanting to prepare meat as reasonable, because she may not want to handle animal flesh. A reasonable compromise would be to offer a mix of vegan and vegetarian dishes and/or to allow others to bring dishes as well.", "I assume she would be offended if those who preferred meat options bring their own.  The fact that she has always been accommodated for her meal preferences by others, she should also be considerate of others.", "NAH. Their disappointment is understandable but they're not entitled to anything, she's the host and if she's not comfortable cooking dishes with animal products in them, it's unethical to force her to, unless a guest is willing to prepare stuff at home/before the party and bring it in, instead of making her cook it. The guests won't die for not eating animal products for a single meal, it's really normal even among meat eaters to not eat animal products every single meal. There are many ways to get to a compromising solution here, nobody has to get mad for this and it feels like a very petty dispute.", "YTA\n\nYou will not die from one meal of fruits and vegetables.", "NTA.

I cried real tears of anguish at not being able to sample egg plant grown from my loves garden this summer. So that being said I am very supportive of her wanting to show non-vegans how amazing some vegan food can be. \n\nHowever, the vote of her being the asshole comes from her expecting everyone to make sure there is vegan food when they host but refusing to accommodate anyone else when she is hosting. That is just rude and thoughtless .", "NTA. How would she feel if a non vegan hosts and they refuse to accommodate vegan diets? And claim it\u2019s just for one meal so vegans can suck it up and eat a piece of meat? It\u2019s not okay. I get with not wanting to cook it but not wanting anyone to bring non-vegan to try vegan is not okay. Vegan excludes many things such as honey, eggs, and dairy. Allowing others to bring vegetarian would be at least easier to accept.", "NTA. Food policing isn't cool, not even for \"just one meal\".

Because he's not forcing his choice on others.", "Ugh vegans.", "NTA - Since other hosts have gone out of their way to have vegan options for her when , it's only right that she does the same and have something that everyone else is willing to eat.

Reddit is so bizarre sometimes. I don\u2019t eat red meat (by choice) and I\u2019m planning to become vegan at some point down the line. My family has always being kind enough to give me options with no red meat in it, and I\u2019m sure they would do the same if I went full vegan. Your family has been kind to cater to her lifestyle choice in every reunion. The bare minimum she could do is return that kindness. If she doesn\u2019t want to cooke or order options with meat in it, she should allow people to bring their food. If she doesn\u2019t want meat in her house, she should give up her turn hosting.

I completely understand her wanting to share her passion for vegan food but why does she think it\u2019s ok to force people to eat it?

Vegan dishes are a fucking nightmare, since so many of them involve hidden death on a plate. Almond milk, vegan butter (often contains nuts), vegan cheese (often contains nuts), you get the idea.

Something that seems minor like switching brands can be the difference between totally safe and not at all safe. \n\nIf it's vegan and it's not just straight up grilled vegetables, I'm out. Not worth my ER copay and a $200-$400 Epi use. If I can bring my own food, I'm happy to bring something vegetarian that I can eat.", "NTA It would be one thing if her motivation was that she can't ethically have meat in the house and told everyone that if she is to host it would have to be that way, but she is doing this to be *evangelistic* about veganism.\n\n>I spoke to her privately and asked if she'd be open to including a few non-vegan dishes for those who aren't keen on a full vegan menu. She got quite defensive, saying **this was her chance to showcase veganism and that for one meal, everyone can give it a go.**\n\nAnyone deliberately hijacking a family gathering to use it as a chance to evangelize *whatever* to a captive audience is an AH.\n\nETA: There are too many people to respond to individually, so I'm going to add this here. My objection is that the vegan sister's direct response to being asked to accommodate those who didn't want to eat only vegan food is that she wanted to showcase her vegan food and that they could eat it for one meal. This is her in no uncertain terms deliberately choosing to force vegan food on others even against their will, for her own reasons. It's this attitude of wanting to force others to give what she is passionate about a try that sticks in the craw. She sees this as her chance precisely because family members will feel obligated to attend the annual gathering, so she will have a captive audience in a setting where she is in control of the menu and refusal will be hard socially and practically. \n\n It's not the *what* so much as the *why.* Personally, I wouldn't care about having to eat a single meal of food that I am known to dislike at a gathering (life happens), but if I knew that the host was choosing to host precisely so that family members who she knew didn't like that style of food would be forced to eat it, with the hope that they would be won over to liking it, every mouthful would taste like ashes -- or I might not attend at all. The attitude, not the food, would taste disgusting.

There's no expectation that my diabetic friends or those just trying to keep healthy are going to make me a sugar-laden dessert when I come to visit.

And everyone's kids running and screaming all over the dang place, but *everyone* was doing exactly what they wanted to do, and it was great. \n\nThen one of the middle school kids asked her dad if he would invite the family into the kitchen so she could play her middle school clarinet recital over a bluetooth speaker.

Then they put the recital on and it was.. a middle school recital on a bluetooth speaker. Nothing special about it, except that everyone in the room was silent and focused on the speaker. No one said a word until it was done, and then everyone told her how great she sounded and how amazed they were that middle schoolers could be so good at their instruments. You couldn't tell her playing from anyone else in the band through that speaker. \n\nShe looked so proud of herself, and her parents were beaming. And it was all because the family decided \"This is what's important right now. Someone in my family wants to share something they made with us and it's our job to love on them in this moment\"\n\nIt was like I was in a foreign country for about 10 minutes, but it changed me a little.

However, there are plenty of \"accidentally vegan\" products as well as mainstream recipes that either don't include animal products or only include animal products that can be substituted or omitted without significantly impacting the taste, texture, or appearance of the food. If the sister is using this as an opportunity to punish non vegan relatives by serving nothing but tofu or nut loaf or whatever it is the family finds off-putting, then she's A.H. here.

I mean, it\u2019s not all salads and fake meat, Oreos are vegan ffs. There\u2019s a difference between accommodating someone with a specific diet and complaining about having to eat food without animal products. I doubt she\u2019s going to evangelize to them, she just wants to show off vegan food that tastes good, especially when so many people insist that food without meat and dairy and such has to be gross and not filling enough. I bet she could make a few dishes and never tell anyone they\u2019re vegan, and the people eating wouldn\u2019t know unless she said so. She\u2019s had years to be the stereotypical vegan and she\u2019s had to deal with her choices being limited. No one\u2019s choices are being limited here, unless it\u2019s something like a person that\u2019s allergic to nuts and she uses a lot of nut-based dairy alternatives in everything, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019d be happy to cook for certain allergies. No one is having their choices cut down to \u201cjust eat the bread\u201d or \u201cwell we made you a salad\u201d here. In my opinion, these are adults that need to be open to something new, instead of deciding beforehand that it\u2019s just not going to work for them.\n\n\nIf someone just can\u2019t stand not having animal products on the table, maybe she\u2019d be ok with having people bring a couple dishes, so she isn\u2019t the one buying said products, and is avoiding potential cross contamination during the cooking process.", "So then they can stop providing vegan options for her when they host and you won\u2019t consider them AH?", "I agree with you. I have lots of food allergies so I don't expect people to give up their usual foods. I pregame and if nothing is edible, I either have snacks waiting or I eat out after.

I do not like mushrooms, eggplant, sprouts, artichokes, etc. So, there really is a limited amount of vegan food I can actually eat.

I get you but she\u2019s accommodated at everyone else\u2019s house, she has no interest in reciprocating that courtesy.
