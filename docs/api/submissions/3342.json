And every year, I order in and have a few friends over for a lowkey night. But this year, I decided to go all out because I was feeling like it. I made a reservation at a nice little restaurant, got a stunning new dress and a pair of thigh high boots. I have never worn high boots, but have always wanted to. I saved up for them for quite some time, and finally got them. \n\nNow, I usually turn to my friends for fashion advice. One of my friends, Amy, had her mind fixed on her opinion. Amy didn't quite like the boots on me, and said they were cute but wouldn't go with the dress I had bought. This was odd, because the rest of my group thought they would go perfectly. I decided to disregard her opinion and got the boots anyway. A couple days pass by, and I get a message from Amy saying that she now owns the exact SAME pair of boots as me because her mom decided to buy them for her. I was obviously confused, but she said that her mom knew she loved high boots so she decided to get them for her. I didn't believe this, but I let it pass.  Then she goes on to tell me that she's planning to wear them to my party. I laughed and told her that I was planning on wearing mine, so she should wear something different for the day. Amy brushed that off and said the boots didn't go with my dress, and that I didn't even know if I was gonna wear the dress I had ordered (it hasn't come in yet, and I tend to have fitting issues, especially at the hips) so I should not count on being able to wear them. This pissed me off, and I told her that I'd ordered the dress one size bigger than I require so the fitting wouldn't be an issue and that I was definitely wearing the boots to my party. \n\nAmy then asked me if I had an issue with her owning the same pair of boots as me, and accused me of having internalised misogyny. I told her that I didn't care if she owned the same stuff as me, but I just didn't want her to wear them to my party because I'd like to stand out and feel special on this one day.  However, she's now decided that I'm an asshole because I can't stand any girl having the same things as me, and I'm sick of this argument. \n\nAita?\n\nEdit: THIGH high boots. Short asf dress. That's the look. I don't care if she wears the same boots or even the dress as me to any other occasion. Also, I'm not trying to tell her not to wear thigh high boots.

But where is the so called \u201cinternalized misogyny\u201d coming from or are we just throwing out buzz words to manipulate people into getting our way?", "NTA. Time for a lesson in \"kill 'em with kindess\" - rock the look and when she shows up tell her how flattered you are that she wanted to look like you.  This only works if you be very sincere and lay it on thick.", "She doesn't sound like a good friend. NTA.", "This is almost a carbon copy as a post from a couple months ago lmfao. Girl having birthday party asked for a friends opinion on the dress, the OP was like \u201cno it isn\u2019t flattering, you won\u2019t look good\u201d, went out, and bought the exact same dress, showed up to the party in it, and the friend who\u2019s birthday it was, was rightfully upset. NTA, your \u201cfriend\u201d sounds like the kind of person who puts others down just to make themselves look like a \u201cgood and caring friend\u201d. Frankly, drop her my guy. Not worth the time or energy.", "NTA. Trust me, if she's this awful to you, she's this awful to everyone but you're all afraid of saying anything. Drop her and everyone else will be relieved she's not there. If they're offended, they're probably not great friends either", "OMYGOSH!! She didn't want you to buy them and was jealous as soon as you got your boots. Went out and bought a pair for herself and is now trying to guilt you into not wearing them OR WORSE shaming you into not wearing them at YOUR PARTY. Why are you friends with this person? NTA", "NTA. Drop her. She's not a friend.", "Nice friend you've got there. You should lose her. She is jealous of you. She can't just give you that one day of all days?\nNTA", "NTA..... and i totally wouldn't rescind the invite. But i totally would take pictures with everyone and tell her she's excluded when she tries to hop in and let her know you told her you didn't want her dressing like you at your bday affair\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Yup, she knows exactly what she\u2019s doing and she\u2019s hoping you\u2019ll bend to her competitive whims. Very weird, not cute. NTA", "NTA Yes she \"loved\" the boots and thought they looked great on you so she lied and got  them for herself.  She is NOT your friend and you should drop her like a hot potato.", "She's probably going to be one of those brides who gets mad when a close friend chooses to wear a white dress and exactly the same veil. Terrible analogy. NTA.", "***THIS***", "Why do you still hang out with her? She\u2019s the literal worst. Please get rid of her. She sounds extremely jealous and insecure to the point of being a real AH.", "Ppl\nR always mad about something  so it doesn\u2019t shock me", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
