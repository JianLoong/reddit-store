And every year, I order in and have a few friends over for a lowkey night. But this year, I decided to go all out because I was feeling like it. I made a reservation at a nice little restaurant, got a stunning new dress and a pair of thigh high boots. I have never worn high boots, but have always wanted to. I saved up for them for quite some time, and finally got them. \n\nNow, I usually turn to my friends for fashion advice. One of my friends, Amy, had her mind fixed on her opinion. Amy didn't quite like the boots on me, and said they were cute but wouldn't go with the dress I had bought. This was odd, because the rest of my group thought they would go perfectly. I decided to disregard her opinion and got the boots anyway. A couple days pass by, and I get a message from Amy saying that she now owns the exact SAME pair of boots as me because her mom decided to buy them for her. I was obviously confused, but she said that her mom knew she loved high boots so she decided to get them for her. I didn't believe this, but I let it pass.  Then she goes on to tell me that she's planning to wear them to my party. I laughed and told her that I was planning on wearing mine, so she should wear something different for the day. Amy brushed that off and said the boots didn't go with my dress, and that I didn't even know if I was gonna wear the dress I had ordered (it hasn't come in yet, and I tend to have fitting issues, especially at the hips) so I should not count on being able to wear them. This pissed me off, and I told her that I'd ordered the dress one size bigger than I require so the fitting wouldn't be an issue and that I was definitely wearing the boots to my party. \n\nAmy then asked me if I had an issue with her owning the same pair of boots as me, and accused me of having internalised misogyny. I told her that I didn't care if she owned the same stuff as me, but I just didn't want her to wear them to my party because I'd like to stand out and feel special on this one day.  However, she's now decided that I'm an asshole because I can't stand any girl having the same things as me, and I'm sick of this argument. \n\nAita?\n\nEdit: THIGH high boots. Short asf dress. That's the look. I don't care if she wears the same boots or even the dress as me to any other occasion. Also, I'm not trying to tell her not to wear thigh high boots.

If your SO really wanted you to do something, a minor thing to you but very important to them, would you not do it just because you don\u2019t care/get it? or would you do it anyways, even if you don\u2019t care, to make your SO happy? \n\nAs someone\u2019s friend, even if you don\u2019t agree with it, especially in this case of a birthday party, wouldn\u2019t you want to do what makes your friend feel happy and supported?

Can you please reread my post and understand what it is I'm posting about? I asked her ONCE if she could save them for later because yes, the \"stupid pair of shoes\" are important to me. She had a meltdown and accused me of a bunch of stuff. I'm asking whether it was inappropriate or unreasonable to ask a friend of mine to not wear the exact same thing I'm wearing to my party. That's the conflict. My party isn't ruined, even if she shows up in the same dress as me. People would only judge her for it. I just hate the competitive energy she brings with her.", "If my friend said \u201cyou can\u2019t wear those shoes because it\u2019s my birthday\u201d I would find a new friend.

I just turned 22 a few days ago and had an awesome day because I spent it with a really good friend. Same with 21st, awesome day with great friends.

WTF? \nSounds like you beat her to the outfit and she\u2019s pissed. But still is trying to beat you. \n\nAgree that nobody wears it if you want to keep her as a friend.

Uninvite her and enjoy wearing your new boots on your special day.", "NTA in my opinion. I don't quite understand all the Y T \u00c0 and E S H. I don't think your demands are crazy. You said you saved up for the boots, clearly this is something that is very important to you. You already talked about it way before. Another commenter mentioned that she tried to talk you out of buying the boots as a manipulative strategy because she probably already knew she would get the them from her mom and wanted to wear them. I had the same feeling all along reading your post. She is gaslighting you in my opinion. If she would be a good friend, she would be happy for you and let you enjoy them that way on that one day. It's not that you're asking her to wear something ugly, cut her hair or cover herself up (referring to the bridezilla comments lol). I am sure she has other nice shoes to wear. She feels off to me.", "Amy isn't your friend. NTA", "Uninvite Amy from the party  => problem  solved.\nNta", "NTA at all. here's what you do: wear what you wanna wear. your other friends all know you want to wear the fit, so in their minds, you are the Leader, and miss girl is the Follower. better yet, send a photo of you in your outfit or just the boots or whatever to the groupchat maybe an hour before the party starts just to hype yourself up and get your friends excited. \n\nthen if miss girl shows up in the same boots, *don't say a word* about it unless someone else does. if someone point out the fun coincidence, you can say something about how happy you are that she found another pair but you wish she would have mentioned it so you could give her a coupon or whatever, just to drive home that you had yours first. if someone calls miss girl out, step in and say something about how sweet it is that she wanted to match on your birthday. if miss girl brings it up first, k!ll her with kindness.\n\nshe sounds like a not-awesome friend anyway, and it might be fun to get a little petty. if that's not your style thats fine, go ahead and enjoy your dang birthday! no matter what she ends up looking like a weirdo since everyone else knows that you were number one and its obvious shes trying to one-up you", "NTA- she seems to want attention, if she wears them then tell her to leave or that would be a consequence it\u2019s your birthday not hers. She seems like the type that would do this again too, so maybe also rethink this friendship.", "NTA.

NTA", "NTA. Your friend has issues. This was all set up, starting with her trying to talk you out of it when your other friends were supportive. Her accusing you of \"internalized misogyny\" seems more like projection based on her actions toward you and trying to make you insecure and second guessing yourself when she's the problem. I'd drop this friend so quick if it were me.", "ESH neither of you gets to tell the other what to wear.", "NTA honestly it just sounds like you should uninvite her given that you guys are not close friends, based on the fact that you two don't have a meaningful relationship and can't even really communicate, and her behavior toward you is suspicious.\n\nI'm not going to define what her behavior really is and what the source of it is, but it sounds like she doesn't actually like you, I'm someone who doesn't like you shouldn't be at your birthday party", "NTA. That\u2019s some mean girl stuff right there and she\u2019s only going to continue to exhibit these weird jealous behaviors until you either call her out or cut her off.

She\u2019s a shitty friend. The internalized misogyny comment is bs. She\u2019s trying to manipulate you. Eff her.

YTA for keeping hood rats in your circle.", "NTA. I say let her wear the boots and see how it goes down. She very openly in front of your other friends tried to get you to not wear them. So they know this about her. It is going to look very tacky when she walks in with the same look that you had already presented to everybody else. Then never talk to her again and tell your friends what she ended up doing. I would probably want to tell them first before she puts her own spin on it.", "YTA", "They're just shoes ffs, why does it matter.", "Seriously, end the problem.", "It's just a thing that's happening right now in the sub, people jump on new posts to be negative I think entirely to get negative points", "To me, Amy doesn't really sound like a friend, but a \"frenemy\"", "Yeah it really sounds like she isn't a friend, she's just a woman who knows you too much", "That was the first thing that went through my mind.", "Is this a reference to something? I know it's a country song, but that doesn't make sense to me. Sorry, I'm a bit lost sometimes.", "Then that's not her fault. If she didn't know I was gonna wear those boots, then it's not her fault for accidentally ending up wearing the same thing. Also thigh high boots aren't the problem. Amy could wear any other pair of those. It's the buying exactly the same ones as mine after putting me down about it and then wanting to wear them to mine. If she'd gotten them because she liked them and worn them on a separate occasion, I would have not cared. And stop reaching, please. I am the last person to tell my friends what to wear to my party.

You don't buy them on a whim. 3) what an effort to wear they are. These are not your go to boot. \nThe chance of it happening randomly is sky high. \n\nEven so, it's not the wearing the same thing that's the problem. It's the manipulation and general ickiness leading up to it. Put downs. Lying. Entitlement. Gross. What a trash friend. \n\nIf friend had simply said \"omg, you look killer. I need to get a pair of those!\" And wore them another time it would have been fine.", "This is the better way to put it. She has gotten physically close just to be negative.

You be you, do you and wear whatever makes you feel happy, beautiful and confident - and if your friend ends up wearing the same or something similar, consider it a compliment of your style and her as not mature enough to express it that way, hence her childish attempts of talking you out of that. How does it say: imitation is the highest form of flattery!? And evaluate your friend in terms of qualities that *actually* matter for a friendship, as in: is she someone you can rely on having your back in a crisis, whom you can call up at 2am if in trouble, who is supportive in the really big life issues etc. If she is, then don\u2019t sweat the small stuff like the boots drama; if she is not, then maybe she is not a friend but more an acquaintance at this point.", "Thank you!!", "Thank you!!", "They are just some sad little gamer with nothing better to do.", "You edited your post to add \"party\".
