And every year, I order in and have a few friends over for a lowkey night. But this year, I decided to go all out because I was feeling like it. I made a reservation at a nice little restaurant, got a stunning new dress and a pair of thigh high boots. I have never worn high boots, but have always wanted to. I saved up for them for quite some time, and finally got them. \n\nNow, I usually turn to my friends for fashion advice. One of my friends, Amy, had her mind fixed on her opinion. Amy didn't quite like the boots, and said they were cute but wouldn't go with the dress I had bought. This was odd, because the rest of my group thought they would go perfectly. I decided to disregard her opinion and got the boots anyway. A couple days pass by, and I get a message from Amy saying that she now owns the exact SAME pair of boots as me because her mom decided to buy them for her. I was obviously confused, but she said that her mom knew she loved high boots so she decided to get them for her. I didn't believe this, but I let it pass.  Then she goes on to tell me that she's planning to wear them to my party. I laughed and told her that I was planning on wearing mine, so she should wear something different for the day. Amy brushed that off and said the boots didn't go with my dress, and that I didn't even know if I was gonna wear the dress I had ordered (it hasn't come in yet, and I tend to have fitting issues, especially at the hips) so I should not count on being able to wear them. This pissed me off, and I told her that I'd ordered the dress one size bigger than I require so the fitting wouldn't be an issue and that I was definitely wearing the boots to my party. \n\nAmy then asked me if I had an issue with her owning the same pair of boots as me, and accused me of having internalised misogyny. I told her that I didn't care if she owned the same stuff as me, but I just didn't want her to wear them to my party because I'd like to stand out and feel special on this one day.  However, she's now decided that I'm an asshole because I can't stand any girl having the same things as me, and I'm sick of this argument. \n\nAita?\n\nEdit: THIGH high boots. Short asf dress. That's the look.

Focus on all the great things you are and that you\u2019ve done in your life, and want to do, and stop caring about something so very unimportant.", "Why are you trying to tell someome what to wear lmao. Don't got any other problems than being the main character? You sound so fucking exhausting, you are bitching about everyone here in the comments who doesn't share your opinion. Why aks in the first place?", "I get it... and I must admit your friend seems to be a bit of the \"AH\" here for refusing to honor what doesn't seem like an unreasonable request.", "\u201cspecial on my birthday\u201d  You\u2019re a bit old for this, no?", "Of course you can wear an outfit just because it makes you feel good. But your point was that if your friend also wears those boots, it takes *attention away from you*. To me that indicates you're more interested in having other people look at you than just wearing something that makes you feel good by itself. And it has nothing to do with being misogynistic. I am a woman, and I would say the same thing to a man who didn't want someone else to wear the same pair of pants to his birthday party because he wanted to look hotter than everyone else.", "But they are shoes. Who cares? Why let it ruin your birthday or friendship?", "I don\u2019t care about your outfit. I think you need to just appreciate that friends want to come out and celebrate with you.", "My birthday is important to me, and I like making a big deal out of it, especially since this is the only party I've ever thrown.", "I heard you. And no, I'd want all my friends to look stunning. Wear whatever they want, dress modestly or not.. it's their preference. It's literally only about wearing the same thing as me to my party.", "It\u2019s a normal term that people use quite literally all the time. Gold star for trying though \u2b50\ufe0f", "And they're important to me? Maybe not to you, and that's okay. I never asked the sub if this is an important matter. I asked if it's unreasonable of me to ask someone to not wear the same thing as me on my birthday. That's the conflict. Not whether I should celebrate my birthday or not, how old I am to feel special on my birthday, whether it's petty or not. The judgment is about whether it's okay or not to ask that of someone.", "Chill out, you\u2019re being mean", "As someone who never had a birthday party, no I'm not. No one's old enough to make a big deal out of their birthday. Not at 20, or 30, or even 90.", "The point is OP is right to air her feelings, and I honestly would prefer my friend asking me not to do something, then say nothing and be secretly peeved. \n\nThe entire story implies the friend is intentionally trying to gaslight OP giving the events leading up to it", "And I do. Amy is always competitive though, and I just don't want that energy at my party.", "I\u2019m still voting ESH, but I truly do hope you have a lovely birthday.", "For sure. People say \u201cdo this shit\u201d all the time, but it\u2019s not usually a sign of approval. Love the star. Thanks!", "Okay, so your boots are important to you, fine, I totally respect that. But why are HER boots important to you too? Yes, I do consider it entirely unreasonable to demand others change their wardrobe because you're going to wear something and you don't want copycats. Even if it's your birthday. Even if she is actually being a copycat on purpose. It's just boots. You're not gonna look any less stunning just because you're not the only one wearing them.", "YTA. i don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable to ask, but how you\u2019re handling the issue by making it a bigger of a conflict than it needs to be makes you sound controlling and insecure. she can wear whatever what she wants even if the reasons do seem sue and you can uninvite her instead of telling her not to wear it, which you can\u2019t do. \n\nor you could roll with the idea of her wearing the boot at the party and being the bigger person there and joking around that you\u2019re twins. or that she has great taste. the party is already about you and the whole day is about you. so yes, sure her wearing the boots - same ones as you - is obviously important to you, but is it worth a conflict with a friend? is it really gonna ruin your whole day or party just because she wears it?\n\nso, yes AH for making it into an argument. you could\u2019ve just dropped it after she said no.", "So is OP. Read the comments of others. It's just infuriating when people post things here and go full butthurt when they hear the sometimes hurtful truth.", "Your boots won\u2019t make you feel special. Being surrounded by people who want to celebrate you and hang out with you will.", "How have you never had a birthday?  Are you less than a year old?", "And OP is letting someone\u2019s shoe choice get under her skin. She is old enough to rise above it and enjoy the party.", "Then you... don't invite her to your party.", "You\u2019re the one having a mini meltdown over your friends shoes. Maybe be mindful of the energy you\u2019re putting out there. Maybe you\u2019re one of those people who thrives on drama, but if it were me, I\u2019d really just want to relax and enjoy the party.", "Although I think this whole outfit debacle is silly, if you don\u2019t want to be around someone with competitive, antagonistic energy, it\u2019s time to cut Amy loose.", "Then you're an AH too. OP, you're not.", "Look at you, being obtuse for no reason. :) how cute.", "Please read the post again. Never made it into a conflict. Just merely asked her if she could save them for a later date. She immediately started accusing me of misogyny.", "I read her comments and while I understand you think she\u2019s the AH in this situation, I don\u2019t think anything she said warranted such a rude response from you. I just think maybe you need to step back and evaluate how you talk to people on the internet. She\u2019s a real person behind the screen. Just a thought, trying to leave a bit of positivity on your very negative post", "Why do you get to decide that? Yes, people around me will make me feel very special. But my outfit will as well. And I don't think that's shallow to want to look and feel amazing on your birthday.", "Not everyone has loving parents.", "Um I don't get it. I never had a meltdown, or any drama. Simply asked her if she could wear the boots at a later date. And then she went off on me at the request.", "Just insults? I\u2019m guessing this means you have no counter argument. Im going to bed. Have fun being in the angry place!", "So her being rude to others is fine, then getting the echo of your actions/behaviour back is mean? Something is out of balance here and it is not OP wanting to be the only one wearing those boots.", "You literally posted your dilemma on a sub that facilitates people giving you feedback. That\u2019s why they get to say that.", "What does that have to do with your birthday?  You\u2019ve had at least 19 birthdays.", "Let her choose her own shoes. She\u2019s a big girl.", "Ignore this troll arguing with you, OP. Some people come on here and comment because they \u201clove the drama\u201d. Your friend is a drama Queen. She isn\u2019t acting like a friend. Disinvite her from the party. Her friendship isn\u2019t genuine. I\u2019m sure you will look stunning and have a great night without her trying to overshadow you. This isn\u2019t about trying to police her body. This girl seems to be straight up single-white-female.\n\nNTA. Anyone saying you are? Well that says more about their behaviour than yours", "No, I just have no interest in continuing a conversation with someone deliberately looking to misinterpret the shit I say. \n\nHope you wake up less annoying.", "Give me one instance where I've been rude.", "I literally said birthday PARTY. Never celebrated my birthday before.", "Well first of all to your friend? You let it slide when she said she didn't like the boots in combination with your dress, but took note of it. She got the same boots (which she didn't even buy) and now you want to keep her from wearing them? Or is that normal to you? Didn't know there is an unwritten dresscode for birthday parties.", "Wait what? She didn't want me wearing the boots that I picked out for myself, and then she ended up getting them for herself and lied that her mom bought them because she had been wanting them for a long time!! Never once has she worn or talked about wanting to own such boots. I don't have a problem she got them, but to wear them to my party knowing I'm wearing them too, and is a big part of my outfit is rude. I simply asked her if she could save them for later, and she was the one who snapped and started being, wait for it, RUDE. Never once was I mean to her."]}
