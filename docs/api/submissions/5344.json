By the time the person in question came along, it was entire group of people being absolute assholes to the 'new girl'.", "Probably not, just the women folk. OP should just develop a tradition of not dealing with idiots and let the future ex bf and his fun loving brothers carry on without her. I am sure these boys have a slew of questionable other antics. NTA.", "I also thought it was going to be the family wearing funny sweaters.\n\nAlso, I call BS on using the phrase 'family tradition' for one family member who likes to harass his brothers' girlfriends.", "JFC", "Sounds like a good way to trigger an ED in someone. Yikes.", "In my first marriage, my MIL passed out red suspenders to everyone one Christmas Eve. It was adorable. Until it wasn't. My FIL yelled for my husband and physically turned me around so I was facing my husband and ran his hand in between my suspenders and my breast. He barely touched me, but he did, in fact, touch me. I later told my husband it made me uncomfortable, and he got ticked off and said, \"oh, you laughed.\" Maybe I did emit some surprised nervous chuckle, but I was really disturbed by it!! And I knew if I said anything, there would be a fight that ruined the whole evening and would last for weeks after, both in my own home and with my FIL. He very much enjoyed making people uncomfortable and keeping them off balance, and anyone who didn't allow him to continue doing it was persona non grata.", "Except that was actually intended to namecall and ridicule one person by calling them stupid. Santa fucking a reindeer (I'm guessing, but also probably right), is not somehow an indictment of the wearer.", "Haha I loved that story and this reminded me of that as well! Maybe it\u2019s wisdom with age, but if I have to be hazed to be part of your family, I\u2019d much rather be alone.", "That one was a doozy, alright \nPeople are very strange..", "It's fake, but it did take a strange person to write such a bizarre fiction.", "Exactly, this cannot be real.", "So, no couch or loveseat? Beds?  Log from the woods?  I find it hard to believe that a family cabin has no other options...", "NTA, but I wonder if this rule is for everyone or not. I would be curious and ask others who would have gone through the experience before you. Was there any other reactions from others??", "If you can't wear it to a elementary school xmas pageant, it's not an ugly xmas sweater. NTA.", "Nta. If it had been an ugly sweater party, I would have said wear it. But it wasn't, and it wasn't even a traditional ugly sweater it was a crude sweater meant to embarrass you. \n\n2 things I find alarming. \n1. Why is the brother allowed to make a tradition to haze and make fun of new girlfriends?\n 2. Your boyfriend's reaction to you not wearing it is a huge red flag for me. If this relationship continues, he's going to put his family and their wants/opinions/needs above yours. I could understand being disappointed that maybe you didn't wear it but he should have defended you and you're right to not wear it. \n\nPersonally, I would be rethinking my relationship. And how supportive he was towards me in the rest of our life.", "Never trust a family culture where hazing is acceptable.  They will keep doing it.  NTA", "Definitely NTA- that doesn't sound like a family tradition, it sounds like hazing/bullying.", "So all the males in this family have a \u201ctradition\u201d to haze new girlfriends and possibly embarrass them in front of a new family? And because you didn\u2019t participate, your boyfriend was the one that felt embarrassed. Why? Because he became the joke over you? Aww poor him.  This to me just seems like a cruel way to be mean to new girlfriends. And it\u2019s very unwelcoming", "NTA, but I would be seriously concerned about how your boyfriend thought it was ok, it seems like you were going to be made a joke out of by him and his family.", "NTA.  Thats not a tradition, that's hazing", "NTA  \n\n\nI would reconsider the whole relationship, he sounds like an ass. His brothers sound like asses.  \nThe whole thing to me sounds just like trying to humiliate and put the new partner 'in their place', which is gross. Honestly, I wonder if they would make a boyfriend wear it.\n\n  \nEither way, it sounds gross and controlling considering how much of a faff they made about you being your own person and not wearing it.  \n\n\nIt would be a bit more forgiving if everyone wore an ugly sweater but even then, you are allowed to say no if you feel uncomfortable with it. That's what they are trying to put in your head currently. That you are not allowed to say no. This is incredibly toxic.", "NTA They have a family tradition of bullying the new person, that he made up. Yeah if I were your boyfriend I\u2019d have ended that idea before it ever got to you.", "NTA. they sound mean.", "NTA. I don\u2019t even mind the \u2018new girlfriend has to wear the ugly jumper thing\u2019 I read this as being a a bit of fun and like you said you were on board with that idea. Making you wear a rude and embarrassing jumper is just inappropriate.", "NTA. Those sweaters are all made of plastic and absolutely destroy the environment. The vast majority are also manufactured by human beings kept as slaves (or treated like them). \n\nSo I\u2019d make a statement about \u201cI don\u2019t support the destruction of the planet or the enslavement of other people for a Christmas sweater.\u201d", "It\u2019s only been a few months op. Dump him. Nta", "Meeting family is stressful. The family adding to it by singling out the new person by insisting they wear a gaudy sweater is fucked. They sound like bullies.

If you wanted to participate cool but forcing anyone to do something they are not comfortable with is ridiculous  your boyfriend and his brother owns you an appogy.", "NTA. A right of passage for a new girlfriend? What is this, college hazing? This is sick and you did right. Having to humiliate yourself to be accepted by a family is a red flag. I would run.", "NTA.\n\nIt would be cute if everyone is wearing an ugly sweater. Forcing you to wear one you dont like is not ok.", "It\u2019s a \u201c fu\u2026.Ed up tradition\u201d. Time someone ended it anyway.", "NTA, when is it right to embarrass and humiliate someone on purpose?  You shouldn\u2019t be put into a situation that is shaming.  Good for you standing up for yourself.  This is a red flag, not just about bf, but his family that condones this behavior.", "NTA. But why not run out and get an ugly sweater of your picking?", "NTA  -I missed the point that this wasn't a sweater that your boyfriend bought, it's a sweater his brother bought because his family is hazing you.\n\nLike let's call it what it is, what you're describing is a hazing. You should stop dating a guy who prioritizes his brother getting to disrespect his new partners over his new partner being comfortable", "NTA.\n\n> it's his brother's (he has three) family tradition to make new partners wear an ugly Christmas sweater of their choosing as a \"rite of passage\" \n\nSeriously consider if you really want to be with a guy that believes that people need to be bullied, humiliated and hazed as the price of admission to a relationship.  Or who has no problem with his brothers dictating his behavior, let alone the behavior of somebody they've never met.\n\nGive yourself the gift of breaking up with this guy while you're still only a few months in.", "NTA  \n\n\nsounded more like they wanted you to wear a vulgar cristmas sweater not an ugly one,  they should have been more clear", "You could get creative and sew or glue felt, tinsel etc over the offensive image to make it all your own. Malicious compliance.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a Christmas party, not a frat initiation.", "Definitely NTA. Your boyfriend sucks. He should have your back. He cares more about what everyone else thinks. \n\nYou don't have anything to feel bad about or apologize for. That isn't a tradition, it's degrading and fucking stupid.", "Ugggh, NTA! Any tradition with the sole purpose of \u201cmake someone miserable and uncomfortable to see if they\u2019re capable of earning our acceptance\u201d needs to be tossed out a twentieth story window and never spoken of again. This family seems like it might not be worth the price of entry.", "NTA.

I'm a guy and my brother and sister in law bought me a sweater that was... not okay... not okay in the same way as you describe. I'm American and now live in the UK where apparently this kind of thing is, IDK, more amusing. Maybe I'm an uptight prick but I wasn't into it. I ended up wearing the sweater to show up to the house and then \"oh gosh it's so warm in here\" maybe 30 minutes later, stripping it off and down to a Christmas tshirt I bought instead. \n\nAnyway, I can see this from both sides but I really have to just stick with NTA as your boyfriend knew it was making you uncomfortable and you guys could have come up with a compromise - like mine was. There should always be a way around these things.", "Info: What was on the sweater?", "NTA. Requiring you and only you to wear an ugly and distasteful sweater is hazing, making you the butt of a nasty \u201cjoke\u201d.  Do you really want to date someone in a family that behaves this way to each others girlfriends?", "NTA this is gross.", "nta, you could have worn a ugly sweater (my niece wore one yesterday, it says \"my ugly sweater\" and has a few xmas thingys hanging off of it, and just mishm ash of colors, etc) that doesn't have vulgarity on it. Frankly, I would seriously reconsider this relationship.", "NTA. Is it a tradition for all partners to wear it or only female partners? My spidey sense is tingling.", "If you're not comfortable, he's the AH for pushing it.", "NTA. There is no need for a rite of passages, especially one that make you uncomfortable. I wouldn\u2019t have worn it either.", "NTA if all of the guests were wearing something like that it'd be different, but their idea of fun is to put a new person in something vulgar and embarrassing during their first holiday with the family?  These do not sound like kind people, and your bf should have stood up for you.", "NTA. An ugly sweater vs vulgar sweater are two different things. If there is anything you can\u2019t tolerate about partner\u2019s family, especially if they\u2019re close/won\u2019t change, it may be better to get out before more strings are attached", "NTA. If it was just an ugly Christmas sweater I'd say take the stick out of your ass, but it's not.  It could hurt your job and more importantly it makes you uncomfortable.", "NTA. This sounds really toxic and gross. Dump the bf.", "NTA. It\u2019s not okay to force people to wear vulgar clothes they\u2019re uncomfortable with or else face social shunning. Your bf is an AH and you should have him post on this sub so Reddit can tear him a new one.", "NTA\n\nUh, there\u2019s a fun \u201cugly Christmas sweater\u201d tradition and then there\u2019s making someone uncomfortable by making them wear what sounds like a pretty sexually charged sweater. \n\nThat\u2019s not fun. That\u2019s mean-spirited.", "NTA- I also thought by the title you were going to refuse to participate in a group ugly sweater tradition (in which case- I would agree with you being a stick in the mud/wet blanked) but purposely embarrassing you on the first meeting? Thats a stupid tradition. Nope. I think you've got some red flags on that family and might want to nope all the way on out.", "ESH, and you\u2019re the asshole for one classic reason on this sub: inability to have adult conversation at the appropriate time.\n\nOthers are assholes, for making a joke too serious and therefore not funny.", "Indeed, there's no point in continuing with a family who wants to Haze you, it's only going to get worse", "Agreed NTA. Here's the scary part for me:\n\n>My bf and I have been dating for a few months, and he invited me to meet his family for the first time for Christmas dinner. According to him, it's his brother's (he has three) family tradition to make new partners wear an ugly Christmas sweater of their choosing as a \"rite of passage\" (his words) for entering the family.\n\nThey've only been together for *a few months* and she's \"entering the family\"? When did dating someone for a few months equate to joining an entire family? That's employing your family to rope someone in. And I don't trust for a moment that someone wouldn't have snapped pictures that could be shared with employers or who knows else to keep her in line. If the mask is falling off at the three-month mark.... girl, run fast, run far, change your number, and warn everyone you can about this dude.", "Exactly. Hazing is not a tradition. Traditions should be things everyone is comfortable doing, and are all in agreement about. This is just bullying, especially when it's forced on people who haven't met the family yet.\n\nI can't bear the type of people whose supposed sense of humour is \"accept my mockery of you or you're not welcome\". They expect people to adapt to their sensibilities but refuse to do the reverse.", "This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve seen hazing behavior posted here before. I don\u2019t understand how basically humiliating and harassing a new partner is \u201cwelcoming to the family\u201d. Along with demanding them to take part in a traditions that are usually outdated and swing towards picking on women.", "Exactly.\nThe moment he told her, \"the ugly sweater is a rite of passage,\" that could have inspired another rite of passage in her mind: if she decides not to, and he doesn't support her, he's out.\n\nSeems like it's heading that way anyway.", "I thought it was a typical ugly sweater that was literally disgusting, like, in a bad condition", "This post really makes me angry.  Instead of seeing that they making a guest uncomfortable they turn it around make her the grouchy jerk who doesn\u2019t know how to have fun. Yuck yuck yuck.  Those bros are gross.", "I agree. It sounds like it's the tradition of the brothers, not the family. Either way, your BF should be backing you up.", "Side note: I've always found it depressing how quickly \"ugly xmas sweater party\" turned from this cute ironic celebration to a mass marketed crap show.\n\n\nIt was like 2 years between \"lol I went to good will and found this tacky sweater \" to \"COME GET YOUR DELIBERATELY UGLY SWEATER.

OP can't. Don't even understand how it's \"bullying.\" They didn't ask OP to wear a sweater that says she's a slut or \"Stick in my chimney,\" or anything of the sort, and Op isn't Santa, so it's really just testing if OP is OK to joke around with.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, why would anybody at work see her sweater? She's didn't have to wear the sweater to work. What a bizarre thing she said.", "And pictures. They'd def take pictures so evidence of OPs compliance and humiliation would be forever coming back to remind her.", "Its the family version of [that one consulting meme](https://www.reddit.com/r/consulting/comments/axu3v7/heres_where_the_fun_begins/) lmao", "Unless the family are subject some some kind of mystical prophesy or witches curse.\n\n18 are the number of the family and 18 they shall remain, at the birth of a new member the oldest returns their lifeforce to the family pool, and thus the cycle continues."]}
