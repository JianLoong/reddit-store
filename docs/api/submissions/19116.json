So I am in a friend\u2019s wedding next month. Recently we had her bachelorette party in another city. 9 out of 11 bridesmaids went, plus the bride. I only knew the bride (high school friend). All the other girls knew each other from college/work friends. I don\u2019t live by any of them.\n\n\nWe all flew/drove far to Bach. A few girls (bride included) flew to a different city airport and drove to our destination, since it was cheaper for them. It was too difficult for me to try to coordinate times so I just flew into the city of the Bach and ubered to and from airport. (Cost was similar for me). \n\n\nWe used Splitwise to tally all expenses. Everything was split equally. First, I shit you not, these girls spent over $700 on groceries/alcohol for Thursday-Sunday. All while ordering $130 worth of food for Thursday night (that i arrived late to and had to eat cold leftovers). Then we all ate out for two meals friday and one meal Saturday. What the hell they spent that money on, I don\u2019t know. A few bottles of wine that I didn\u2019t drink from because they finished it Thursday night? They also split decorations cost, about $250. In my experience that\u2019s usually the job of the MOH. She did nothing extra btw, but she got o share the biggest room with a private bathroom with the bride.\n\nBut whatever, I wasn\u2019t going to make a fuss. What pissed me off was when they included me in the split for the rental car they used, claiming it as a \u201chouse expense\u201d since it was used to get groceries and alcohol. Um, if this car was available, why was i stuck spending $100 on Ubers to/from airport??? We also did not use it to go downtown, we ubered from air bnb. \n\nAnyways, I\u2019m pissed, and I\u2019m hosting all these girls day of wedding at my house. I spent probably $1200 on this Bach (was really only anticipating $800 since I don\u2019t eat much on vacation). I am obviously getting food and drinks for day of wedding and decorations for my house. Would it be bad if I asked the other girls to split the cost? I feel embarrassed even thinking about it (when you host, you provide- that\u2019s how I do it). I can afford the food and stuff, but since these girls want to split everything so equally, I\u2019m tempted to split that with them.\n\nWIBTA if I sent them requests for cost of food/drinks/decorations for things I buy for day of wedding?", "created_utc": 1686053517, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142e2de/wibta_for_charging_the_other_bridesmaids_for/", "score": 62, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Then yes, you should send them an invoice to be paid upfront before anyone sets foot in your house.", "How much are you spending?", "I would absolutely have them split the bill with you.

I questioned the car rental and that\u2019s when she told me it was a house expense and if I had an issue with it we could discuss with everyone. However, no one else challenged it so I did not want to be that person to make things difficult for everyone.\n\nMy thinking was - if they\u2019re the type to split everything, why not split costs for wedding day?", "Exactly. \n\nOP is going to get a lot of NTAs because this sub sometimes values revenge and retaliation above all, but why chose this drama when OP should have spoken up back at the bachelorette party.", "Would probably be couple hundred (200-300). Answered in another comment.", "No the costs were not discussed. The other girl couldn\u2019t afford the air bnb/flight. I did not have a a problem with that. I had a problem with the excessive spending done while there as well as not getting any input on what we wanted for food/drinks. (I did make one request though, and they conveniently forgot to get it). \n\nI did not expect to pay for decorations and rental car either. My share of the rental car was less than one Uber ride from airport. They didn\u2019t even offer to pick me up. And any other Bach I went to MOH was in charge of decor.", "Oh ok I see now. Well hang in there, you're almost through the craziness. \ud83d\ude09", "I am 100% with you on the rental car and you needed to speak up then. But otherwise, for a weekend of fun and frivolity that doesnt seem like much.\n\nI know thats subjective but if it truly was out of your budget, you should have interjected then and not used this getting ready as a chance to get them back", "NTA- but I would say maybe get decorations (depending on how much your trying to spend on them) your self and let them know ahead of time that you would not have any food or drinks (other then tap water) at your place and people will need to supply there own. All while making it clear that your contribution is the house and decorating and that\u2019s it\u2026\n\nBut also I can\u2019t see too much alcohol and food being needed for pre-wedding stuff, so you might still end up spending the most money. You can get let them know now that you all will be spilting the cost, or pre map out what the cost is (through an app like Sam\u2019s club or Instacart.) send it to them now and say that you expect the money one week before the date or you can not get the items", "NTA.  But I am the AH, because it took me until the end of your post to realize that 'Bach' is not a city.  You were abbreviating Bachelorette.  I am going to now go sit quietly in the corner with my dunce cap securely fastened to my head.", "NTA.  It can get expensive.  Couch it as you\u2019re providing the location, if they want more, ie., drinks and snacks they will need to chip in x amount.  Then stick to budget for the extras.", ">that i arrived late to and had to eat cold leftovers\n\nLearn to use a microwave, learn to be on time, and learn to stand up for yourself better.\n\nESH", "YWNTA. Same rules must be followed for splitting costs at your place as was at the Bach.", "NTA. I used to have a group of friends who were very similar to the bridesmaids you are describing. Whenever we planned vacations or trips they would accrue huge costs and split it between everyone (even though I didn't agree in advance and I was a vegetarian so they would normally spend hundreds on food they wanted and I would request a couple of small things). What I came to realise is that they genuinely didn't think they were doing anything wrong. They didn't even look at it like that. Should they have had more consideration, because not everyone earns the same amount of money / has different expenses and priorities? yeah, definitely. But ultimately in the end I had to put my foot down and started saying \"you guys get what you want and split it, i'll take care of myself\". It might not work in every scenario and definitely caused a few uncomfortable moments for me, but I would much rather that than paying hundreds for things I didn't even use. In this scenario, I would most definitely ask them to cover their share of costs. Weddings are expensive for the bridal party! The same reason they wanted to split the costs can be said for you. I would just say something like \"I'm starting to prepare for hosting, does anyone have any specific requests they'd like me to include? I am planning to keep to a budget of X amount which will come to roughly X amount each. Confirming this is ok?\"", "NTA but the person who needs to split the costs with you is the bride. This is her wedding and these are her bridesmaids. If she wants everyone to get ready together, she is supposed to provide the space to do so. It\u2019s not supposed to fall on someone else.", "YWNBTA.\n\nThey are doing it to you, so you should do it to them. Also, bridesmaids, normally split the cost of this type of thing.  It\u2019s not like they asked you in advance.", "NTA everything is split equally", "nta ask them to split, that's clearly the route they're going", "Right! I don\u2019t even have 11 friends!", "To be fair, microwaved leftovers never taste good.\n\nI wasn\u2019t late because I can\u2019t be on time, but rather because my flight got in later than everyone else\u2019s.\n\nLearn to stand up to myself? Fair enough, I should\u2019ve done that. \n\nI think ESH is a fair judgment, thank you.", "But those two still benefit from the event at your house. You shouldn't feel that you're getting back at the others for overcharging you at the bachelorette, just splitting costs like they did. Food and drinks for one day won't come nearly as high as a whole weekend event, plus it's in your hands how much you spend. Tell everyone beforehand that you're getting X, Y, and Z for the day so the split costs come to $$.\n\n You're still being generous in opening up your home to people you don't really know. I mean, you won't be charging them for chair and bathroom use and all the phones they'll be charging up at yours, right?", "They should be lucky you're not invoicing your \u00fcber", "I mean, I get it - it's hard to be the \"squeaky wheel\", especially in a group of people you don't know. \n\nBut I'm not sure the alternative - staying quiet and letting it fester like this - is really any better. Nothing to do about that now, of course, just a thought for the future.", "Where is the bride in all of this? It\u2019s her wedding. She should be providing food for her 11 bridesmaids. That\u2019s just common courtesy.", "Maybe instead of asking to split (it does seem petty and I'm always the one spending the least in a group) ask people to bring things they can easily pick up.  Honestly, if you like the bride and want to stay friends I'd just suck it up.  You should have refused the rental car on principle and you didn't.  Let that be a lesson.  But is the $200-300 worth the friendship?", ">To be fair, microwaved leftovers never taste good\n\nA far sight better than cold, congealing leftovers.", "Only people who attended should pay", "You may want to head to a wedding sub for this then - but in my opinion etiquette would dictate that you offered to host, you dont charge guests. \n\nIf you were voluntold to host, different story. \n\nI think one thing youll want to consider - what will the bride think? Is getting back at them worth potentially causing drama and upsetting her?"]}
