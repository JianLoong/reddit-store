But being tired is not the only affect of being pregnant, and it's not the one most people are even thinking of. \n\nNow, there is a lot of variability in how pregnancy impacts people so these may not be true for every individual pregnant person, but let me explain to you why people would offer a pregnant women their seat. So, according to the CDC website \"during late pregnancy\" women's balance may be impacted. This is important beacuse 1: \"changes in a pregnant women's hormones impact ligaments and joints\" (this is so the body can change shape more easily to fit or squeeze out a baby). Beacuse of this a pregnant women is not only more likely to fall over then another healthy adult but she is more likely to be injured by a fall. The baby also risks being injured by the fall, or it causing a miscarriage. (Think about how pregnant women are no longer allowed on a lot of rides.) Also, according to the CDC \"Prolonged standing or heavy lifting can cause an increased chance of miscarriage or preterm delivery (premature birth).\" (Also, while  less common, some people experience light headiness and are more likely to fall that way.) \n\nOn top of that, being tired in pregnancy is not the same sort of thing as being tired outside of pregnancy. Yes, pregnant women often get less sleep due to being uncomfortable or various other symptoms but that's not what I mean. Pregnant women's hearts and lungs have to work harder then those of people who aren't pregnant. Now, pregnant women's ribs actually expand so their lungs can increase in size but their hearts stay the same size and just have to work harder which makes all forms of physical activity (including standing) more work then it is for nonpregnant people. \"During pregnancy, the amount of blood pumped by the heart (cardiac output) increases by 30 to 50%. As cardiac output increases, the heart rate at rest speeds up from a normal prepregnancy rate of about 70 beats per minute to as high as 90 beats per minute. During exercise, cardiac output and heart rate increase more when a woman is pregnant than when she is not.\" Also, again, this can impact the fetus. When a pregnant women gets winded from excursion it can impact the amount of oxygen going to the fetus as the body prioritizes the mother over the child. \n\nAnd then of course pregnancy can cause a variety of uncomfortable or painful symptoms in the legs or hips that are again not the same as being tired. So for example I would get random horrible leg cramps when pregnant, which is apparently a normal thing some women get. (Mine were always in the middle of the night though, I feel not so luckily as it would wake me up 2-4 times a night.) You can have the baby pushing on your pelvis in a way to get horrible pelvis pain which can make standing difficult. Luckily this mostly didn't happen to me but I know someone who had this pretty bad. \n\nAs it turns out having a whole second person inside of your body displacing your organs and living off of you (and the changes your body has to make for this to even be possible) is not the same as just being tired.", "Then you can explain to them that you need the seat because you have foot issues, i would consider that a good enough reason to not give up your seat. HOWEVER being tired from standing all day is NOT an excuse to not give up your seat. It doesnt matter if he was in priority seating or not, it's called being a decent human being.", "I agree\n\n- providing op wasn't in the priority seats", "You would have been an asshole, too.", "Ahhh we have two assholes here then.", "You are wrong many pregnant women get light headed and they are at risk of falling if they stand on public transport, if you have feet problems then you are disabled and don't have to give up your seat but this asshole does.", "Ugh - the loose hip joints!

If I turned quickly - my huge liquid filled preggo belly would just sort of keep going and yank me off balance.\n\nOp - you do you - personally, I find the energy I get from helping someone else have a better day makes my feet not hurt so bad.\n\nIn the past couple of years - I\u2019ve have 5 surgeries, 18 chemo infusions, and 30 radiation treatments - I wouldn\u2019t tell you this if it weren\u2019t an anonymous forum because the point of this story isn\u2019t to get a pat on the back.\n\nYou know what made some days a lot better?
