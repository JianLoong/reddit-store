But being tired is not the only affect of being pregnant, and it's not the one most people are even thinking of. \n\nNow, there is a lot of variability in how pregnancy impacts people so these may not be true for every individual pregnant person, but let me explain to you why people would offer a pregnant women their seat. So, according to the CDC website \"during late pregnancy\" women's balance may be impacted. This is important beacuse 1: \"changes in a pregnant women's hormones impact ligaments and joints\" (this is so the body can change shape more easily to fit or squeeze out a baby). Beacuse of this a pregnant women is not only more likely to fall over then another healthy adult but she is more likely to be injured by a fall. The baby also risks being injured by the fall, or it causing a miscarriage. (Think about how pregnant women are no longer allowed on a lot of rides.) Also, according to the CDC \"Prolonged standing or heavy lifting can cause an increased chance of miscarriage or preterm delivery (premature birth).\" (Also, while  less common, some people experience light headiness and are more likely to fall that way.) \n\nOn top of that, being tired in pregnancy is not the same sort of thing as being tired outside of pregnancy. Yes, pregnant women often get less sleep due to being uncomfortable or various other symptoms but that's not what I mean. Pregnant women's hearts and lungs have to work harder then those of people who aren't pregnant. Now, pregnant women's ribs actually expand so their lungs can increase in size but their hearts stay the same size and just have to work harder which makes all forms of physical activity (including standing) more work then it is for nonpregnant people. \"During pregnancy, the amount of blood pumped by the heart (cardiac output) increases by 30 to 50%. As cardiac output increases, the heart rate at rest speeds up from a normal prepregnancy rate of about 70 beats per minute to as high as 90 beats per minute. During exercise, cardiac output and heart rate increase more when a woman is pregnant than when she is not.\" Also, again, this can impact the fetus. When a pregnant women gets winded from excursion it can impact the amount of oxygen going to the fetus as the body prioritizes the mother over the child. \n\nAnd then of course pregnancy can cause a variety of uncomfortable or painful symptoms in the legs or hips that are again not the same as being tired. So for example I would get random horrible leg cramps when pregnant, which is apparently a normal thing some women get. (Mine were always in the middle of the night though, I feel not so luckily as it would wake me up 2-4 times a night.) You can have the baby pushing on your pelvis in a way to get horrible pelvis pain which can make standing difficult. Luckily this mostly didn't happen to me but I know someone who had this pretty bad. \n\nAs it turns out having a whole second person inside of your body displacing your organs and living off of you (and the changes your body has to make for this to even be possible) is not the same as just being tired.", "Then you can explain to them that you need the seat because you have foot issues, i would consider that a good enough reason to not give up your seat. HOWEVER being tired from standing all day is NOT an excuse to not give up your seat. It doesnt matter if he was in priority seating or not, it's called being a decent human being.", "I agree\n\n- providing op wasn't in the priority seats", "You would have been an asshole, too.", "Ahhh we have two assholes here then.", "You are wrong many pregnant women get light headed and they are at risk of falling if they stand on public transport, if you have feet problems then you are disabled and don't have to give up your seat but this asshole does.", "Ugh - the loose hip joints!

If I turned quickly - my huge liquid filled preggo belly would just sort of keep going and yank me off balance.\n\nOp - you do you - personally, I find the energy I get from helping someone else have a better day makes my feet not hurt so bad.\n\nIn the past couple of years - I\u2019ve have 5 surgeries, 18 chemo infusions, and 30 radiation treatments - I wouldn\u2019t tell you this if it weren\u2019t an anonymous forum because the point of this story isn\u2019t to get a pat on the back.\n\nYou know what made some days a lot better?

I'm arguing *him* being singled out to give up his seat because he's a young man.", "Why do they have to explain private medical issues to a stranger? \n\nThe pregnant lady have other seats and other people to try. Seems like a shocked pikachu who hung around and moan at them in a passive aggressive tone. \n\nWas her sitting down more important? Or was the fact someone said no to her more important?", "Please, start the non-obviously disabled vs pregnant discussion.", "Only one, the woman demanding a seat.", "I don\u2019t think you read the comment you are replying to.", "Why did she not ask the 20 other people on the bus?", "Probably because she knows who is is, and found it easier to directly ask someone she knew personally. \n\nIt can be really intimidating to approach a group full of headphone-wearing, phone-staring strangers, get their attention and ask them for a seat.", "Even if she had OP is still an asshole for Turning her down, elderly, disabled and pregnant women are supposed to get seats over anyone else.", "Because he's a young man who looks able-bodied so *obviously* he doesn't need a seat. /s", "If you're disabled you have a reason to have a seat. If you don't advocate for yourself then no one else will. It doesn't make a pregnant person an asshole because they asked for a seat.", "If you have chronic pain you\u2019re more than welcome to talk to your doctor about being considered disabled. Chronic pain is considered a disability. Judging by the many comments saying disabled people would also deserve a seat\u2026yes they would defend you. I\u2019m 29 and physically disabled and I\u2019ve never had an issue getting a seat when I explain I\u2019m disabled or if I have my cane. If you don\u2019t want to advocate for yourself that\u2019s a you problem.", "Respectfully, I\u2019m going to disagree with you. If you asked me to stand and indicated you had health issues I would, as I\u2019m young enough. When I was pregnant, I had a LOT of issues that made me unwell. Especially since so many disabilities are invisible, I would never push back if someone advocated for themself, and I\u2019m sorry if you\u2019ve had that experience in the past.", "And either he is lying that she kept pestering him, or she kept asking him because he was taking up the priority seat meant for elderly, disabled and pregnant passengers. But I\u2019m not completely convinced the entire story isn\u2019t made up. Either way, AH.", "ya I'd go ESH bc it isn't okay to pester one person like that. He shoulda got his ass up, but it's also common curtosy to only ask once and move on. \n\nYou'd think someone else would have noticed and offered up a seat - it's pretty sad nobody did, so I do feel bad for her. She was being an ass,  but OP was def the bigger one imo.", "Or thought maybe since she knew who he was that he might be more willing to give up his seat since people often are more empathetic to someone who\u2019s not a complete stranger.", "Australia. I know some people work longer hours but it\u2019s not that common.", "Negative attention is better than no attention. But that's what my cat belives so take it with a grain of salt.", ">And disabled folks\u2019 choice to be disabled, obviously\n\nlooking to be offended or did someone say that?", "Well, it is in the same sense as the elderly have a choice. Unless completely disabled they could all (elderly or disabled) off them selves I guess. Not a choice most make.", "The bus only had one seat. He was the driver.", "I\u2019ve delivered babies for 20 plus years and just need to tell everyone to ignore this person pseudo science.", "\u201cNothing about humans is natural.\u201d Proceeds to explain a natural process.", "Clearly you do need to be convinced, seeing as you made your initial comment stating otherwise. What if someone has an unseen disability? Are they not noticeably sick enough for you?", "Sounds like you fall under disability in that case, so no. Being tired and having actual physical/health conditions don't fall under the same umbrella. \n\nPregnancy, while temporary, is still a health condition that deserves the same courtesy.", "No? Because you're disabled? Very very simple logic to follow.", "That would fall under the disability category.", "unlike op, you actually have an excuse not to give up your seat.", "Not the same. OP isn\u2019t disabled, he\u2019s just an AH. I don\u2019t even feel like I need to justify my opinion because the majority of decent people would never be rude to pregnant woman the way OP was simply because they pleaded for a seat. \u201cNo\u201d would\u2019ve been fine, still rude, but not as rude as shit-talking her to his friend while she\u2019s standing right next to him.", "You are disabled. OP is not. He's just an AH. Like it's not that hard to comprehend. I wouldn't expect you to give up your seat to another disabled or elderly person anymore than give it up to someone that is pregnant.", "Yup!", "Society as a whole doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s right, just that the passengers wouldn\u2019t get up.", "Or a bus full of selfish/oblivious assholes. I\u2019m disabled and I used to ride the bus everywhere for years. You\u2019d be amazed how many people have zero interest in being considerate to anyone but themselves, even when faced with someone who has a visible disability.", "Not really, even though she knew him, if he says no the first time I don\u2019t think he was gonna change his mind after being asked the 3rd, 5th, or 10th time. At that point she could have asked someone else and would have been sitting down.", "Because bills gotta be paid?", "Why assume she isn\u2019t? Every pregnancy is different and many women struggle throughout the entire thing\u2026 also she told OP she was struggling", "yea cause if it\u2019s a regular seat then she should\u2019ve asked someone else and i doubt there would be no one on a bus willing to give up a seat for a pregnant women, now if the guy reveals it was a priority seat then he\u2019d definitely be TA", "Yeah I know. I was responding to above who said that being pregnant doesn\u2019t grant you special privileges. But it actually does in the form of priority seating. I should have been more clear lol so many ppl are responding to me lol", "that doesn't make him less of an asshole", "I do agree that she should have gone and asked someone else after he declined giving up his seat or gone to the bus driver for help. Having said that she shouldnt have had to ask more than once, he should have just gotten up for her. \n\nI guess the woman recognized him from his Aunt which is why she persisted. Maybe she wasnt comfortable asking others. I have to question what the other people on the bus were doing. If i was there and saw a visibly pregnant woman standing i would have gotten up. Maybe she wasnt visibly pregnant yet, maybe everyone had headphones in, i dont know.", "You're right they dont. If they had a condition then that's another story but OOP just said they were tired. Being tired isnt a disability.", "I absolutely will not.\n\nStanding up for a pregnant woman is common courtesy and the world is a better place like that. This is where all discussion ends for me.\n\n*Especially* when it's a young healthy person who'd stand up.\n\nNot standing up is selfish and entitled.", "Because she knew his aunt and knew him...she may have been to shy to ask anyone else. My mom fainted on the subway when she was pregnant with me because noone offered her a seat and she was to shy to ask.", "I think that\u2019s the craziest thing\u2026 it was someone he knew and still said no?", "He didn't he was just being lazy ! If he had a disability then he wouldn't be an asshole, man way to many comments like yours on this thread is disgusting.", "She isn't entitled to his seat just because she's pregnant tho. She should have accepted his no and asked someone else.", "In the US it is pretty much expected if you work a salary", "I think people like to try out their writing chops.   They might try to write a scenario that's finely balanced or write a scenario where they are the asshole but written in such a way that they can get people to agree that they are not.", "You might need to get more continuing education credits.", "She kept talking at him. His friend asked who she was because he could clearly hear her on the other side of the phone. At worst this is ESH", "ok i see your point but why couldn\u2019t she go and ask someone else for their seat instead of constantly pleading with the op for his seat, the way op written it makes it seem like she didn\u2019t even try", "No. It makes anyone in the priority seats, not moving the AH.\n\nThe priority seats are the ones you're legally required to move.\n\nOP is entitled to the non-piority seats.", "Standing all day will also make your feet/ankles hurt unless op has feet of steel. He didn\u2019t need to explain to the pregnant lady that he was in pain and tired, she should have just asked someone else on the bus after he said no.", "If you're sitting in the back. On a full bus.\n\nBut thoes in need ask you to move and not someone sitting in the priority seats... Is that fair?\n\nThe problem is it doesn't seem like op was in the priority seats, meaning he is not required to move.\n\nThe woman should have asked someone sitting in thoese seats or get on a different bus.\n\nIf someone with a Buggy wanted to get on the bus, but someone with a wheelchair was already there / priority seats full they wouldn't be allowed on and are required to wait for the next bus.\n\nThe women singled him out because he looks young and 'doesn't need to sit'.\n\nYour logic that he doesn't need to sit, is the same as him not needing to move.", "Not here. You people are so screwed over.", "I wasn\u2019t there, so can\u2019t assume a reason but there\u2019s many possibilities! Maybe the other seats were out of reach, or the ones nearest had elderly/disabled people in them, or maybe OP was seated In a seat designated for disable/pregnant/and elderly.", "OP hasn't shared where in the world they are. There are a lot of places where buses don't have such a thing as priority seating. In those places, everyone is expected to prioritize people with greater needs, no matter what seat they are sitting in. I suspect that's the case here.", "As i said before, being tired from standing all day is not a disability. If he's that sore he should get better footwear. I used to work retail including long 10 - 13 hr shifts and would often have to stand on the way home which was an additional hour.", ">The problem is it doesn't seem like op was in the priority seats, meaning he is not required to move.\n\nMy stance is *completely unrelated* to what is required. It is based on *common courtesy*.\n\nFrom there, *nothing* you write is relevant to me.", "Yeah that is why I said \"in the US\" after all", "I don\u2019t know of any footwear brand that helps your feet feel no pain after standing/walking for 12 hours. You said you had to stand. If you did not have to stand, would you choose to sit? I\u2019m sure you would. On the bus you have the choice to sit or stand and he wanted to sit. Either way the woman should have asked someone else for a seat after he said no."]}
