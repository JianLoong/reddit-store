At this point, she can't go 5 minutes without making some loud obnoxious sounds. She'll shriek, clap her hand, cough loudy, sneeze loudly and just make strange noises that I don't even know how to describe. My parent [both 49] and I [15] have all asked her why she does this. \n\nShe claims that she is neurodivergent, she says she has ADHD and Autism and thinks she probably has something else too. She even sent us videos talking about these disorders and why people with them need to make these noises to feel okay I guess. I don't think she has them because I did research and she doesn't seem to have any other important symptoms of these disorders.\n\nThe things is when we are out and around people she still makes these noises which is very embarrassing, but she makes them a little more quietly and less frequently. I told her that this proves she can control it but she says she can only control it a bit for a few hours but she shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable in our house by trying to control it. \n\nMy parents are just going along with it and allowing her to do this even though they don't believe her. I told her to go get a real diagnosis if she is really serious about this and so that she finds ways to stop doing this but she refuses. My parents tell me to let her be but it's just so annoying. Even if I stay in my room, I hear all the obnoxious sounds she makes all day. I have to put on headphones which are uncomfortable when I'm really tired of hearing it.\n\nLately, I've been calling her names each time she makes an obnoxious sound. I will also sit in the living room because I hate staying my room all day and will loudly play music she doesn't like and sing badly and sometimes make fun of the noises she makes. All this makes her angry. My parents tell me to stop because she went crying to them about it but I said if they don't force her to go to therapy I won't stop.\n\nMy parent are clearly stressed about all this and I feel kinda bad but I don't really feel bad for annoying my sister back.

Is she formally diagnosed with ASD and ADHD or has she just decided she has these?  People are often right when they suspect but are undiagnosed but most want the validation of a formal diagnosis.  It can be expensive so some aren't able to be assessed.  Your sister has that opporunity.\n\nSome of your sisters symptoms sound like it could be Tourette's.  It's a tic disorder, it's not just about swearing at people.  It can come on suddenly.  But in order to be diagnosed it needs to have been occurring for longer than 7 months and other things need to be excluded (it's a clinical diagnosis after other possible things are ruled out - you'd need an EEG and a brain MRI or other diagnostics).\n\nYour parents aren't handling this very well and are basically enabling her.  She could very well have all of these and a diagnosis will open up new supports for her, but if she's not behaving like this in class she is either masking or she's doing this for attention at home.\n\nShe may have tried it to see how she goes but found it worked very well so has escalated.\n\nBut you cannot change your sister, you can only change your response to her.  If she's deliberately being antagonistic then you need to leave the room.  If her outbursts are loud then noise cancelling headphones may be appropriate.  Your sister can't complain that these are making fun of her because they are actually strategies to protect you and your mental health.\n\nAre you able to talk with your sister at all?  Perhaps asking whether it would be a good idea if she was assessed and would she consider it.  It will open up doors for her.  She may be scared that she is wrong in her personal guess at a diagnosis, or there are actually other mental health issues going on.", "NTA .\nYour parents are AH they should be taking her to doctors and therapist . You are a child (something which others are forgetting ) . \n\nIf your sister has real issues these need to be addressed and requires therapy . If she is faking it for attention she still needs therapy as there is something wrong with her as at aged 16 this is not normal behaviour to begin with and needs to be reviewed by professionals (she is not a toddler that this behaviour could be accepted ).\n\nAs to you it seems that you have had enough , but be mindful whilst she may be faking these symptoms it does appear that she is suffering some sort of mental health issue to be faking these symptoms . \n\nDemand your parents get her looked at pronto", "NTA - but your parents need to step up and make her go get a real diagnosis of any alleged condition so she can get help. Even if she is \u201cneurodivergent\u201d one would think this pattern of behavior impacts her quality of life too and she would want help.", "Nta. Your sister needs to get off tiktok.", "This isn't about anyone being TA, it's about your parents needing to take your sister to be evaluated right now.  There are conditions that result in people making noises and saying loud and sometimes embarrassing things that are not under their control.  Your sister needs to see a psychiatrist and/or a neurologist yesterday.  She's 16.  Not only can your parents make her get an evaluation, it's their job to make her be evaluated.  It's a health issue, it's serious, and it needs to be addressed.  And if there's no physical basis for her behavior, then she needs to see a clinical psychologist to get to address the problem.", "Sounds like your sister wants these illnesses...", "NTA - I would say E S H but if your parents and her don\u2019t want you to show your annoyance at her behavour then imo they need to get her a diagnosis.", "Sounds like your sister is wanting attention. Self diagnosis of mental health disorders is not appropriate. Your parents should take her to the doctor for testing so she can get proper medicine and treatment.\n\nYou getting frustrated with her is understandable, as your parents at best are enabling her and at worst ignoring real health issues. If your sister truly does suffer from ADHD and autism, you'd probably feel like shit knowing that you're teasing her. You need to have an honest conversation with your parents about your sister's behavior and how it is impacting you. If they still do not listen, talk to your teacher, or school counselor and let them know what's going on at home. Teachers and counselors are mandated reporters, meaning that they are required by law to report abuse of children to authorities (which if your sister truly has these medical conditions and your parents are ignoring them this would constitute abuse). This may be a harsh way to go, but if your parents aren't going to do their job, someone needs to be the responsible person and that person can be you.\n\nESH.", "This one is difficult to judge honestly. I\u2019m going to say ESH but it would be Y T A if she actually does have a diagnosis. Now let me explain:\n\nFirst off, your parents need to make sure she gets evaluated ASAP because if she does have a diagnosis she deserves to get the help she needs NOW! And if she does have a diagnosis you need to apologise to her and you and your parents need to educate yourselves. She might have Tourette\u2019s syndrome, it\u2019s one of the more common disorders to be paired with ADHD/ASD (OCD is another one for example). I do find if she\u2019s faking ticking/stimming this consistently I gotta say I\u2019d be impressed. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t have a diagnosis and this is just another one of the \u201cbeing neurodivergent is cool so I\u2019m gonna pretend I am\u201d BS self diagnosis based off of Ticktock videos your parents need to nip that in the bud ASAP and this can probably also be done with an evaluation.

I have two sons on the spectrum with adhd, properly diagnosed. I probably am on the spectrum myself but I haven't been properly assessed/diagnosed and so I don't go around claiming to be. Until she is officially assessed/diagnosed she cannot claim to be on the spectrum or have adhd, it's insulting to those that have been. Your parents need to do something about this.", "I\u2019m going with NTA which I know will get me some heat. \nMental disorders are not something to be flung around. I had a best friend who despite being told she does not have ADHD by a top psychiatrist, still convinced everyone she did - then she wanted to have insomnia\u2026. You see the theme. \n\nShe sounds more like she\u2019s lacking attention from your folks and using social media to not only have the \u2018in thing\u2019 but to gain said attention and to go to therapy will expose her. \nI clap my hands together weirdly when I\u2019m stressed without knowing.

I'll be blunt. It's trendy to appropriate several \"common\" conditions such as autism as an identity. I know a 20 yo case who engages in similar behavior. I'm willing to bet your sister is consuming \"information\" online in what can only be described as echochambers (essentially propaganda) of such conditions. \n\nThe evidence you're right is the control she has over the loudness AND her refusal to be (or not be) diagnosed properly.\nThe fact that NEURODIVERGENT is NOT medical, psychiatric nor psychological terminology but an attempt of feeling special and even above \"normal\" people or as the call us \"Neurotypical\" is also relevant.\n\nI personally think it's a disservice to the people who actually suffer from this conditions and a shameless desperate narcissistic desire for attention.\n\nUnfortunately I don't see what you could do, reasonably at least. Unreasonably, you can imitate to extreme degrees her behavior and claim the identity as your own.

I am now 23 and am able to kind of control them, so they are not visible, but they are still here. Stimming vocally is also something I did, and my mother especially was terrible about it. I think what helped me was that my sisters mostly ignored it and I had a couple of friends that didn't mind my tics. I would disrupt class regularly and nobody ever asked to get me diagnosed. Now I don't feel the need for a diagnosis, but I am certain it is an autism trait. You should think about the consequences of your name calling, because if she really cannot control it, like I couldn't and you are being an AH about it, it will only get worse for her and for you and your family. Imagine somebody telling you to stop something you don't even realize you are doing. It makes a person feel worthless and like a piece of sh**, and the consequences are lasting.", "NTA. People need to stop self diagnosing themselves off of TikTok videos. Sounds like a cry for attention.", "Duck tape her mouth shut!", "No judgment because your parents are the real AHs here. They need to make her see a real doctor and figure out what's going on. There are a variety of reasons she might be showing these symptoms, from a physical disorder to a psychological disorder to an attempt to get attention in a dysfunctional way that could be addressed in therapy. But it's neglectful of your parents to ignore her strange behavior. It's their job as the parents to get her medical attention.", "Unfortunately it's become trendy to self-diagnose with certain conditions. Some of these self-diagnoses are accurate, some are not and are more attention-seeking.  Be careful. You're not a doctor and you don't know what's going on with your sister. She clearly identifies with some of the things she's read, so until she goes through a diagnosis process, don't say or do things that you might regret if it all turns out to be real. If you can't handle it, don't act out in annoyance or revenge, just retreat as much as possible. Otherwise you may well be YTA.", "Drag her to a professional who can diagnose her. If she is, then you're the AH and if she isn't, she's the AH.\n\nDelf diagnosis at that age sounds like she just wants attention, if she really refuses.

How come no one is looking for a doctor to get a diagnosis? I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with ADHD... There are people who cannot stop making sound and fidgeting.

I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say they\u2019re from being adhd or being autistic\u2014 more of stress/anxiety. \n\nMy partner has both verbal and physical ticks when their anxiety plays up. Their verbal ticks revolve around the words \u201cmeow\u201d and \u201click\u201d\u2014 when they begin to think about the workload they have from school, they release a random meow or just say lick again and again. I\u2019ll be honest\u2014 they don\u2019t bother me. I want to marry this person, with that comes accepting them. \n\nOn another note\u2014 you do not get to decide if your sibling is faking things or not. That\u2019s why there are professionals. \n\nYour sibling is right about the aspect of verbal ticks\u2014 while my partner does them out of anxiety, your sibling is doing them for comfort. These two things can be mutual. \n\nYou are more than likely not going to find \u201cofficial\u201d documentation about \u2018ticks\u2019. I know my partner struggled with its diagnosis. What you will find is communities surrounding it. \n\nYour sibling isn\u2019t doing these for attention, from the way you described it\u2014 they try to muffle themselves in public. They just need comfort. \n\nI recommend asking them about it instead of shutting all communications down.", "YTA for insulting her, not for being annoyed. It's quite impressive of her to do these sounds days on end, when she's alone, etc if she's acting. So chances are she's not acting. That said, she should indeed not self diagnose and she may not have ASS at all.", "Unless you have very, very good reason to think she's faking, YTA\n\nIt sounds like Tourette's, which often co-presents with other conditions like autism.\n\nAs it happens I'm a Tourette sufferer myself, so let me share some insider's insights here.\n\nTics can be controlled up to a point, in the sense that they don't disappear but get \"re-routed\" to behaviours that are less visible in certain circumstances \u2013 when in company, I tend to do this almost unconsciously, so people don't notice it so much, but it's still there and I still know. Please do not take this as a sign that it's not a real problem. It's a coping mechanism, not a fix. \n\nTrying to hold it in is like trying not to scratch a horrible itch: it takes all the willpower and focus you have.\n\nWhen I'm tired and get to relax after a long day, I grunt. Some evenings I grunt pretty much non-stop. I have the incredible luck that my husband manages to happily ignore it, but it's still incredibly annoying and frustrating to me. Not to mention, it's exhausting, because on any given day I'll be putting all that energy into random movements and noises. I've been stuck with this problem \u2013 for which, by the way, there is no proper treatment \u2013 for nearly 40 years now.\n\nSo as annoying and embarrassing as it certainly is for you, remember you get to walk out of the room or do stuff on your own, far from your sister's tics. She, on the other hand, has to deal with it 24/7 and probably will have to do so for the rest of her life. She doesn't get to take a break from herself.

At the same time she hasn't been diagnosed with anything of any kind and if I understand correctly her noise level and such changes in different situations, she could just be attention seeking. My advice, get better headphones, encourage your parents to have her see a Dr as she may actually have a serious problem, don't be an AH. Even if she is doing this for attention, something could be going on with her somewhere else and this is her acting out due to some problem. Does she do this in class? While driving?

And your sister is right, autistic people, but females especially, do often have the ability to exercise SOME control of it for short periods of time - it's called masking and it's exhausting and uncomfortable and nobody should be asked to do it.

I am 40 and still learning about it, having three totally different daughters who are all suspected as being on the spectrum (but doctors and teachers all missed the signs I was pointing to for the first few years of me trying to get them support, until a medical profession finally saw the older one in sensory overload and suggested we go and tell the doctor that it was their suggestion she be referred and not just a parental observation). I can guarantee that you aren't qualified to make a diagnosis though, so stop deliberately belittling and berating her because if you are wrong then you are making it harder for her.

I know it\u2019s hard because you\u2019re their kid and it\u2019s not your business to make decisions for your sister but maybe do some research on your own, look for credible websites and resources, not to prove that your sister doesn\u2019t have a diagnosis but on why getting an answer is important and then present them with the information.

I used to make noises like that too when I was younger without much control over it, and sometimes still do, although much less frequently. It is true that these noises are difficult to control and if you suppress them long enough will just burst out, much like a sneeze. You can control them in public, but like your sister said, it is exhausting and difficult.

It's being more talked about in the nurodiverse (since there's a long list of what counts) spaces, I know specifically in AFAB autistic. Doing things like allowing ourselves to stim and use aids.

These are very real, and the information your sister has told you is correct when it comes to tic disorders. Tics are INVOLUNTARY sounds or motions that can sometimes be highly disruptive (load shouts and yells) or obscene (swear words etc).   \n\n\nWith TS, it is very common for tics to start presenting during teenage years. Tics can usually not be \"controlled\", but many of them can be suppressed for some period of time. this takes a huge toll and is incredibly tiring. It also varies widely from person to person how well you're able to suppress tics. Some people can go an entire day at school or work without tics, but will usually have to sleep 12-14 hours a day because it is so tiring. Other people can only suppress them for minutes at the time. In both cases, you'll usually end up having to \"release\" the energy you've suppressed when you get home/out of public spaces. Tourette's also has a significant co-occurrence with ADHD (About 50% of people with TS will also have ADHD).   \n\n\nYour frustration is understandable, as tics can be very disrupting for those around you. However, ask yourself. If YOU think these tics are embarassing when you're out and about, imagine how your sister feels. In a sense, the fact that her tics are quieter and less noticeable in public, is actually proof that they are involuntary. Some people here are saying she's doing it for the attention. If that were true, she would either do it to the same extent in public (wanting attention from anyone and everyone), or she would just stop it in public (because the attention she wants is specifically from you, your parents or her teachers, etc.). She's trying her hardest, and likely expending A LOT of energy to keep her tics as non-disruptive as possible when in public.   \n\n\nYour parents should take this more seriosly, and get her diagnosed. While there aren't many viable medicines or treatment options for tics, understanding the tics, their causes and how it affects both the person with the disorder and those around them can improve all of your lives. Most developing countries will have an association for those with Tourettes and tic disorders, along the lines of the Tourette Association of America.  These associations, or your GP/local mental health provider would be the best place for your parents to start:  https://tourette.org/about-tourette/overview/  \n\n\nShe's not the AH, as again, tics are involuntary, and can only be controlled/suppressed in limited ways for a limited length of time.   \n\n\nYou're not the AH, since frankly, I don't expect a 15 year old to understand or even know about tourettes/tics.   \n\n\nYour parents are the AHs, for not taking it seriously and getting her diagnosed.   \n\n\nSource: I've lived with Tourette's Syndrome for about 27 years now, and I've been active in my national Tourette's association for about half that time.", "Lol, Cartman did this in an episode of South Park.
