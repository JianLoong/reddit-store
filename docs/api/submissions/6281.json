At this point, she can't go 5 minutes without making some loud obnoxious sounds. She'll shriek, clap her hand, cough loudy, sneeze loudly and just make strange noises that I don't even know how to describe. My parent [both 49] and I [15] have all asked her why she does this. \n\nShe claims that she is neurodivergent, she says she has ADHD and Autism and thinks she probably has something else too. She even sent us videos talking about these disorders and why people with them need to make these noises to feel okay I guess. I don't think she has them because I did research and she doesn't seem to have any other important symptoms of these disorders.\n\nThe things is when we are out and around people she still makes these noises which is very embarrassing, but she makes them a little more quietly and less frequently. I told her that this proves she can control it but she says she can only control it a bit for a few hours but she shouldn't have to feel uncomfortable in our house by trying to control it. \n\nMy parents are just going along with it and allowing her to do this even though they don't believe her. I told her to go get a real diagnosis if she is really serious about this and so that she finds ways to stop doing this but she refuses. My parents tell me to let her be but it's just so annoying. Even if I stay in my room, I hear all the obnoxious sounds she makes all day. I have to put on headphones which are uncomfortable when I'm really tired of hearing it.\n\nLately, I've been calling her names each time she makes an obnoxious sound. I will also sit in the living room because I hate staying my room all day and will loudly play music she doesn't like and sing badly and sometimes make fun of the noises she makes. All this makes her angry. My parents tell me to stop because she went crying to them about it but I said if they don't force her to go to therapy I won't stop.\n\nMy parent are clearly stressed about all this and I feel kinda bad but I don't really feel bad for annoying my sister back.

Is she formally diagnosed with ASD and ADHD or has she just decided she has these?  People are often right when they suspect but are undiagnosed but most want the validation of a formal diagnosis.  It can be expensive so some aren't able to be assessed.  Your sister has that opporunity.\n\nSome of your sisters symptoms sound like it could be Tourette's.  It's a tic disorder, it's not just about swearing at people.  It can come on suddenly.  But in order to be diagnosed it needs to have been occurring for longer than 7 months and other things need to be excluded (it's a clinical diagnosis after other possible things are ruled out - you'd need an EEG and a brain MRI or other diagnostics).\n\nYour parents aren't handling this very well and are basically enabling her.  She could very well have all of these and a diagnosis will open up new supports for her, but if she's not behaving like this in class she is either masking or she's doing this for attention at home.\n\nShe may have tried it to see how she goes but found it worked very well so has escalated.\n\nBut you cannot change your sister, you can only change your response to her.  If she's deliberately being antagonistic then you need to leave the room.  If her outbursts are loud then noise cancelling headphones may be appropriate.  Your sister can't complain that these are making fun of her because they are actually strategies to protect you and your mental health.\n\nAre you able to talk with your sister at all?  Perhaps asking whether it would be a good idea if she was assessed and would she consider it.  It will open up doors for her.  She may be scared that she is wrong in her personal guess at a diagnosis, or there are actually other mental health issues going on.", "NTA .\nYour parents are AH they should be taking her to doctors and therapist . You are a child (something which others are forgetting ) . \n\nIf your sister has real issues these need to be addressed and requires therapy . If she is faking it for attention she still needs therapy as there is something wrong with her as at aged 16 this is not normal behaviour to begin with and needs to be reviewed by professionals (she is not a toddler that this behaviour could be accepted ).\n\nAs to you it seems that you have had enough , but be mindful whilst she may be faking these symptoms it does appear that she is suffering some sort of mental health issue to be faking these symptoms . \n\nDemand your parents get her looked at pronto", "NTA - but your parents need to step up and make her go get a real diagnosis of any alleged condition so she can get help. Even if she is \u201cneurodivergent\u201d one would think this pattern of behavior impacts her quality of life too and she would want help.", "Nta. Your sister needs to get off tiktok.", "This isn't about anyone being TA, it's about your parents needing to take your sister to be evaluated right now.  There are conditions that result in people making noises and saying loud and sometimes embarrassing things that are not under their control.  Your sister needs to see a psychiatrist and/or a neurologist yesterday.  She's 16.  Not only can your parents make her get an evaluation, it's their job to make her be evaluated.  It's a health issue, it's serious, and it needs to be addressed.  And if there's no physical basis for her behavior, then she needs to see a clinical psychologist to address the problem.", "Sounds like your sister wants these illnesses...", "NTA - I would say E S H but if your parents and her don\u2019t want you to show your annoyance at her behavour then imo they need to get her a diagnosis.", "Sounds like your sister is wanting attention. Self diagnosis of mental health disorders is not appropriate. Your parents should take her to the doctor for testing so she can get proper medicine and treatment.\n\nYou getting frustrated with her is understandable, as your parents at best are enabling her and at worst ignoring real health issues. If your sister truly does suffer from ADHD and autism, you'd probably feel like shit knowing that you're teasing her. You need to have an honest conversation with your parents about your sister's behavior and how it is impacting you. If they still do not listen, talk to your teacher, or school counselor and let them know what's going on at home. Teachers and counselors are mandated reporters, meaning that they are required by law to report abuse of children to authorities (which if your sister truly has these medical conditions and your parents are ignoring them this would constitute abuse). This may be a harsh way to go, but if your parents aren't going to do their job, someone needs to be the responsible person and that person can be you.\n\nESH.", "This one is difficult to judge honestly. I\u2019m going to say ESH but it would be Y T A if she actually does have a diagnosis. Now let me explain:\n\nFirst off, your parents need to make sure she gets evaluated ASAP because if she does have a diagnosis she deserves to get the help she needs NOW! And if she does have a diagnosis you need to apologise to her and you and your parents need to educate yourselves. She might have Tourette\u2019s syndrome, it\u2019s one of the more common disorders to be paired with ADHD/ASD (OCD is another one for example). I do find if she\u2019s faking ticking/stimming this consistently I gotta say I\u2019d be impressed. \n\nIf she doesn\u2019t have a diagnosis and this is just another one of the \u201cbeing neurodivergent is cool so I\u2019m gonna pretend I am\u201d BS self diagnosis based off of Ticktock videos your parents need to nip that in the bud ASAP and this can probably also be done with an evaluation. A medical professional would be able to see right through it and would tell her to cut it out real quick if that\u2019s the case.", "NTA you\u2019re clearly just a stressed out kid who need their parents to step up.\n\nI think you should just ignore your sister nosies you don\u2019t have to think what she\u2019s doing is right but name calling her or calling her out isn\u2019t going to change anything,I don\u2019t know if talking to your parents is going to change anything but stress them out and make them blame you.\n\nYou can\u2019t control what they do but you can control what you do try putting headphones on or join after school programs,hang out with friends or do a hobby,my point it don\u2019t let her control your life and just do your best to ignore it maybe when you\u2019re more relax try talking to your parents again.", "NTA, sounds like she's doing it for attention. I have two sons on the spectrum with adhd, properly diagnosed. I probably am on the spectrum myself but I haven't been properly assessed/diagnosed and so I don't go around claiming to be. Until she is officially assessed/diagnosed she cannot claim to be on the spectrum or have adhd, it's insulting to those that have been. Your parents need to do something about this.", "I\u2019m going with NTA which I know will get me some heat. \nMental disorders are not something to be flung around. I had a best friend who despite being told she does not have ADHD by a top psychiatrist, still convinced everyone she did - then she wanted to have insomnia\u2026. You see the theme. \n\nShe sounds more like she\u2019s lacking attention from your folks and using social media to not only have the \u2018in thing\u2019 but to gain said attention and to go to therapy will expose her. \nI clap my hands together weirdly when I\u2019m stressed without knowing.

I'll be blunt. It's trendy to appropriate several \"common\" conditions such as autism as an identity. I know a 20 yo case who engages in similar behavior. I'm willing to bet your sister is consuming \"information\" online in what can only be described as echochambers (essentially propaganda) of such conditions. \n\nThe evidence you're right is the control she has over the loudness AND her refusal to be (or not be) diagnosed properly.\nThe fact that NEURODIVERGENT is NOT medical, psychiatric nor psychological terminology but an attempt of feeling special and even above \"normal\" people or as the call us \"Neurotypical\" is also relevant.\n\nI personally think it's a disservice to the people who actually suffer from this conditions and a shameless desperate narcissistic desire for attention.\n\nUnfortunately I don't see what you could do, reasonably at least. Unreasonably, you can imitate to extreme degrees her behavior and claim the identity as your own.

I am now 23 and am able to kind of control them, so they are not visible, but they are still here. Stimming vocally is also something I did, and my mother especially was terrible about it. I think what helped me was that my sisters mostly ignored it and I had a couple of friends that didn't mind my tics. I would disrupt class regularly and nobody ever asked to get me diagnosed. Now I don't feel the need for a diagnosis, but I am certain it is an autism trait. You should think about the consequences of your name calling, because if she really cannot control it, like I couldn't and you are being an AH about it, it will only get worse for her and for you and your family. Imagine somebody telling you to stop something you don't even realize you are doing. It makes a person feel worthless and like a piece of sh**, and the consequences are lasting.", "NTA. People need to stop self diagnosing themselves off of TikTok videos. Sounds like a cry for attention.", "Duck tape her mouth shut!", "No judgment because your parents are the real AHs here. They need to make her see a real doctor and figure out what's going on. There are a variety of reasons she might be showing these symptoms, from a physical disorder to a psychological disorder to an attempt to get attention in a dysfunctional way that could be addressed in therapy. But it's neglectful of your parents to ignore her strange behavior. It's their job as the parents to get her medical attention.", "Unfortunately it's become trendy to self-diagnose with certain conditions. Some of these self-diagnoses are accurate, some are not and are more attention-seeking.  Be careful. You're not a doctor and you don't know what's going on with your sister. She clearly identifies with some of the things she's read, so until she goes through a diagnosis process, don't say or do things that you might regret if it all turns out to be real. If you can't handle it, don't act out in annoyance or revenge, just retreat as much as possible. Otherwise you may well be YTA.", "Drag her to a professional who can diagnose her. If she is, then you're the AH and if she isn't, she's the AH.\n\nDelf diagnosis at that age sounds like she just wants attention, if she really refuses.

How come no one is looking for a doctor to get a diagnosis? I don\u2019t think it has anything to do with ADHD... There are people who cannot stop making sound and fidgeting. I don\u2019t remember what the name is but it is an actual condition.\n\nUntil your parents seeks professional help how do we know if she\u2019s faking or not?", "YTA. \n\nFrom your post, I\u2019m going to bet that it\u2019s verbal ticks. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say they\u2019re from being adhd or being autistic\u2014 more of stress/anxiety. \n\nMy partner has both verbal and physical ticks when their anxiety plays up. Their verbal ticks revolve around the words \u201cmeow\u201d and \u201click\u201d\u2014 when they begin to think about the workload they have from school, they release a random meow or just say lick again and again. I\u2019ll be honest\u2014 they don\u2019t bother me. I want to marry this person, with that comes accepting them. \n\nOn another note\u2014 you do not get to decide if your sibling is faking things or not. That\u2019s why there are professionals. \n\nYour sibling is right about the aspect of verbal ticks\u2014 while my partner does them out of anxiety, your sibling is doing them for comfort. These two things can be mutual. \n\nYou are more than likely not going to find \u201cofficial\u201d documentation about \u2018ticks\u2019. I know my partner struggled with its diagnosis. What you will find is communities surrounding it. \n\nYour sibling isn\u2019t doing these for attention, from the way you described it\u2014 they try to muffle themselves in public. They just need comfort. \n\nI recommend asking them about it instead of shutting all communications down.", "YTA for insulting her, not for being annoyed. It's quite impressive of her to do these sounds days on end, when she's alone, etc if she's acting. So chances are she's not acting. That said, she should indeed not self diagnose and she may not have ASS at all.", "Unless you have very, very good reason to think she's faking, YTA\n\nIt sounds like Tourette's, which often co-presents with other conditions like autism.\n\nAs it happens I'm a Tourette sufferer myself, so let me share some insider's insights here.\n\nTics can be controlled up to a point, in the sense that they don't disappear but get \"re-routed\" to behaviours that are less visible in certain circumstances \u2013 when in company, I tend to do this almost unconsciously, so people don't notice it so much, but it's still there and I still know. Please do not take this as a sign that it's not a real problem. It's a coping mechanism, not a fix. \n\nTrying to hold it in is like trying not to scratch a horrible itch: it takes all the willpower and focus you have.\n\nWhen I'm tired and get to relax after a long day, I grunt. Some evenings I grunt pretty much non-stop. I have the incredible luck that my husband manages to happily ignore it, but it's still incredibly annoying and frustrating to me. Not to mention, it's exhausting, because on any given day I'll be putting all that energy into random movements and noises. I've been stuck with this problem \u2013 for which, by the way, there is no proper treatment \u2013 for nearly 40 years now.\n\nSo as annoying and embarrassing as it certainly is for you, remember you get to walk out of the room or do stuff on your own, far from your sister's tics. She, on the other hand, has to deal with it 24/7 and probably will have to do so for the rest of her life. She doesn't get to take a break from herself. And she sure as hell doesn't need your judgment, your comments or your criticism.", "Yta for antagonizing her noises... At the same time she hasn't been diagnosed with anything of any kind and if I understand correctly her noise level and such changes in different situations, she could just be attention seeking. My advice, get better headphones, encourage your parents to have her see a Dr as she may actually have a serious problem, don't be an AH. Even if she is doing this for attention, something could be going on with her somewhere else and this is her acting out due to some problem. Does she do this in class? While driving?

And your sister is right, autistic people, but females especially, do often have the ability to exercise SOME control of it for short periods of time - it's called masking and it's exhausting and uncomfortable and nobody should be asked to do it. Tourettes is another one where you could watch a thousand videos of different people with Tourettes and see a thousand different ways to present with it. I am 40 and still learning about it, having three totally different daughters who are all suspected as being on the spectrum (but doctors and teachers all missed the signs I was pointing to for the first few years of me trying to get them support, until a medical profession finally saw the older one in sensory overload and suggested we go and tell the doctor that it was their suggestion she be referred and not just a parental observation). I can guarantee that you aren't qualified to make a diagnosis though, so stop deliberately belittling and berating her because if you are wrong then you are making it harder for her.

These are very real, and the information your sister has told you is correct when it comes to tic disorders. Tics are INVOLUNTARY sounds or motions that can sometimes be highly disruptive (load shouts and yells) or obscene (swear words etc).   \n\n\nWith TS, it is very common for tics to start presenting during teenage years. Tics can usually not be \"controlled\", but many of them can be suppressed for some period of time. this takes a huge toll and is incredibly tiring. It also varies widely from person to person how well you're able to suppress tics. Some people can go an entire day at school or work without tics, but will usually have to sleep 12-14 hours a day because it is so tiring. Other people can only suppress them for minutes at the time. In both cases, you'll usually end up having to \"release\" the energy you've suppressed when you get home/out of public spaces. Tourette's also has a significant co-occurrence with ADHD (About 50% of people with TS will also have ADHD).   \n\n\nYour frustration is understandable, as tics can be very disrupting for those around you. However, ask yourself. If YOU think these tics are embarassing when you're out and about, imagine how your sister feels. In a sense, the fact that her tics are quieter and less noticeable in public, is actually proof that they are involuntary. Some people here are saying she's doing it for the attention. If that were true, she would either do it to the same extent in public (wanting attention from anyone and everyone), or she would just stop it in public (because the attention she wants is specifically from you, your parents or her teachers, etc.). She's trying her hardest, and likely expending A LOT of energy to keep her tics as non-disruptive as possible when in public.   \n\n\nYour parents should take this more seriosly, and get her diagnosed. While there aren't many viable medicines or treatment options for tics, understanding the tics, their causes and how it affects both the person with the disorder and those around them can improve all of your lives. Most developing countries will have an association for those with Tourettes and tic disorders, along the lines of the Tourette Association of America.  These associations, or your GP/local mental health provider would be the best place for your parents to start:  https://tourette.org/about-tourette/overview/  \n\n\nShe's not the AH, as again, tics are involuntary, and can only be controlled/suppressed in limited ways for a limited length of time.   \n\n\nYou're not the AH, since frankly, I don't expect a 15 year old to understand or even know about tourettes/tics.   \n\n\nYour parents are the AHs, for not taking it seriously and getting her diagnosed.   \n\n\nSource: I've lived with Tourette's Syndrome for about 27 years now, and I've been active in my national Tourette's association for about half that time.", "Lol, Cartman did this in an episode of South Park.

Avoiding getting one just seems very convenient? \nShe also seems like she\u2019s mixing up stims and tics. Tics are uncontrollable and don\u2019t come with autism or adhd but can be suppressed for a couple hours which is what she seemed to say when you asked about her being able to control it. Stims are traits of autism and usually aren\u2019t just random noises but repetitive noise or movements, they can be controlled. It\u2019s not common that somebody will randomly start ticing or stimming so it\u2019s very likely she\u2019s doing this for attention.\nUnfortunately both ADHD and autism is now a TikTok trend and there\u2019s so much miss-information being spread which has somehow made being neurodivergent trendy. \nA lot of the symptoms of both these conditions are experienced by a neurotypical people just not to the degree that makes the condition (eg. Fidgeting, bad attention, getting anxious when meeting new people, hating small talk etc) she may have just seen a few symptoms that she experiences and exaggerated them to get attention? Or she may actually think she has them and some placebo effect has made her start making noises?? \nThat being said if she actually has these conditions and is being made fun of because of the symptoms this could really effect her mental health. Growing up neurodivergent Is hard especially if your family doesn\u2019t support you. I would definitely sit down and have a serous conversation with her about why she thinks she has these conditions. I would also recommend her looking at the RAADS test and autism quotient which are pretty reliable sources for if she is genuinely worried she may have autism. \nAlso if she is faking it please let her know how harmful that is towards the community and people that suffer from these conditions.\nI hope you and your family and sort this out and she gets a diagnosis if she needs one.", "People don't fake being mentally ill, they fake being mentally healthy.  What would she get out of behaving like this?  What prize does she receive?  Even if she is doing it \"on purpose\", it's because she's got some strange complex of motivations and ideas about the world that causes her to behave this way... even though really it only worsens her own social position. That, too, would be mental illness.  You can also count all the people in history who were ever abused out of mental illness on zero hands.  So, yes, YTA.\n\nAlso, I would suggest that she probably fears therapy because it is scary.  Go check out r/therapyabuse.  It's not a risk-free undertaking, particularly for a minor.", "Maybe your sister has Tourette's or some other tic disorder if she is not on the Autistic Spectrum. Please take her to a doctor for evaluation. I am sure your tough love methods are not helping. YTA", "OP: your sister has said she thinks she is ND and is behaving in a manner you find irritating, talking about how it effects you and seeking a compromise seems like the best option, but just trying to drive her out of the space you share intentionally for something that for her is potentially not under her control feels mean spirited.\nIt sounds like both of you frankly could do with a pair of noise cancelling headphones.\n\nCalling her names again is just mean, let\u2019s pretend for a minute that you are actually 100% right and it is attention seeking and she knows this (which is very rare and also a hell of an assumption to make, and thus not one I agree with making). This attention seeking behaviour would likely be a cry for help. And you instead are choosing to be unkind. Even if you don\u2019t agree, try to show your sister some love and compassion, and work through this maturely. You come off to me as someone who is very against change, a trait that you might want to look into.", "NTA faking disorders is disgusting and self diagnosing isn\u2019t valid or real. Just makes you a real AH.", "So, the thing about you trying to disprove self diagnosis is that you actually don't know what's going on inside your sister.  I'm guessing you haven't done a deep dive on how dopamine affects not only mood, but memory and voluntarily body movement.  You probably don't know the role of serotonin in maintaining body temperature, weight and involuntary movement.  You probably have no clue how estrogen affects how those (and other hormones).  The other thing is that most medical research is done on males (see Estrogen, referenced above), which fucking sucks because, as you may have noted, your sister isn't a boy.\n\nOne thing I want to point out is that people say she's faking it for attention.  There's two points about this.  One is that your sister, like you, is still a child and should be getting attention, especially if there's scary stuff like \"oh, my brain doesn't work like the people around me\" going on.  The other is that normal people really value being normal and won't pretend to be \"special\" by being not normal.  (Also, a narcissist is a person with extremely low self esteem to the point they can't handle the slightest criticism, and so the majority of narcissist are actually conscientious to the point where they grind themselves down trying to be perfect for everyone.  They'll lie about things they're ashamed of, not about things that would make them seem 'lesser' in the eyes of others.  Let's stop diagnosing people we don't like as narcissistic, shall we?)\n\nYou mentioned in a comment that trying to keep up your own shrieking and loud music is driving you crazy and that you don't know how long you can keep it up.  That proves that you do have control over it and you could keep it up indefinitely, right?  Try doing it, even at low volume and less frequently, in front of strangers in crowded places.  I'm sure it'll be totally easy and that you can in fact just keep screaming all of the time.  \n\nHere's the thing, at the end of the day your sister does need help, but most of the help for autistic people is a kind of conversion therapy with similar suicide rates as gay conversion therapy.  There are occupational therapy practices that would likely make life easier for her, but you can't shame her out of this.  Medication is the gold standard for ADHD (and yes, autism and ADHD go hand in hand) because if you can't just will yourself into having willpower, because willpower is a cocktail of hormones that \"normal\" people just get to have.  \n\nI also want to point out for the people who think it's a fad to say your autistic or ADHD, even if someone is wrong about their diagnosis (ADHD and OCD in women can be hard to suss out), they have something going on.  It's up to your parents to arrange appropriate medical care for your sister.  She needs to see someone who specializes in autism in girls and women.  I had a seizure and my neurologist (a literal brain scientist) said I \"don't look autistic\" and I was tempted to ask him if he'd like to see me scream and beat my head with my fists.  \n\nI get that you're tired of living in a situation that is stressful for you, and even you say that it's uncomfortable for you to expose yourself to your headphones for long periods of time.  Imagine if the whole fucking world was like that.  Imagine if your sister was making loud noises to spite and shame you.  Honestly I get that it's winter and we're still  in a pandemic but I think for real you just need time apart.  Your sister will only make more noises the more stressed out she is, so calling her names and blasting music she hates is working against your end goals.\n\nIn short, please learn now, in middle school, that your experience is not the experience of all people.  What works for you will not always work for other people.  And please, for fuck's sake, learn to believe people about their lived experiences.  You are a side character in her life, don't become a villainous one.", "This is going to be unpopular, but ESH.

Even more messed up if she refuses to go to an assessment and chooses to self diagnose. People don't usually sled diagnose for no reason. But it's a possibility here I suppose. Also, in regards to the \"controlling it\" thing, I'll explain it as if she was autistic. So controlling it is called masking, and if someone is forced to do it (mask) 24/7, like at work, at home, with friends ect, it can lead to extreme decline of their mental state. If they always have to mask, it leads to autistic burnout, which can be a very serious thing. You know what, ESH.

If she won\u2019t go to a doctor, she is faking it. Period. So many people fake this stuff nowadays and those of us who are genuinely neurodivergent get a bad rep.", "NTA. \nSounds like sister is wanting attention bad.

I have been diagnosed with both and I can confirm that, although I myself don't do it, lots of people with autism do make frequent random noises and it's not something they can control. I don't make any of the sound your sister makes but I do have a tic where I occasionally sniffle and it has annoyed people. \n\nI think your sister is a tiny bit of an AH for self diagnosing and insisting she has neurodivergence when she's never been evaluated. I feel like that invalidates the rest of us who have gotten officially diagnosed. And when people who self diagnose don't actually have what they say they have it makes the rest of us look bad and further encourages stereotypes. \n\nI also think you're a little bit of an AH because you're reaction is super immature. If she had an actual diagnosis and proof she couldn't control the sounds would you still react that way? Would you still mock and make fun of her? Because if the answer is yes then you'd be a major AH.\n\nAlso your parents are MAJOR AH for not getting your sister evaluated and into therapy.\n\nETA: Did these noises start kind of out of nowhere?

I knew I had depression before seeking the help of medical professionals, but that doesn't mean we strictly self diagnose and not follow up with a professional. Especially when treating a disorder. Also, if medical professionals can easily misdiagnose someone, then I would expect someone who is not trained who self diagnoses to misdiagnose at a higher rate. Just because you read something online doesn't mean you have it. Specifically, with mental health disorders there's a lot of overlap in symptoms from one diagnosis to another. So not being trained to understand this and what specifically to look for a lay person could easily misdiagnose themselves.

I have faced a lot of gaslighting in my life, and unpacking and over-coming that has been very difficult. It's taken therapy, confronting members of my family, discovering things I didn't know until recently (like that I saw a speech therapist because I didn't talk in nursery, despite being able to talk) and a whole raft of other things that have lead me to the conclusion that I am autistic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe amount of doubt that can come with this when you've faced a lifetime of gaslighting is not easy to overcome.

I don't think you give a flying monkey about people who have self-diagnosed, I think you think all autistic people are only autistic after an official assessment from a psychiatrist, and that that might not always be available, or might be super hard to get for someone, doesn't mean anything to you. Thankfully for me I also think your opinion on self-assessment is **trash**.

Self assessment can be valid, basing it on a single social media video isn't, but spending a lot of time researching on the internet, looking at the autistic lived experience (which has absolutely nothing to do with your weird and stupid race analogy), looking at tests made by autistic people to help indicate if someone may benefit from exploring an official assessment or not (like the ones on this site: [https://embrace-autism.com/about/](https://embrace-autism.com/about/) ) and directly talking to autistic people where you end up with overwhelming evidence that you likely are autistic, is.  \n\n\nNeed I add that most people who are **newly** assessed as autistic have suicidal ideation, and this is very much because a lot of them haven't found other autistic people to be around, and as a result feel incredibly isolated and misunderstood, should factor in to how you treat people.  \n\n\nhttps://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/study-reveals-high-rate-of-possible-undiagnosed-autism-in-people-who-died-by-suicide\n\n[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1074742722001228](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1074742722001228)  \n\n\nYour argument being repeated that essentially mocks anyone who self assesses people who have yet, for whatever reason, to be assessed, is frankly horrifying.\n\nAs per my other comments on this post, I'm not in a position to say if the OP's sister is or isn't ND, but just making an assumption they're not itself is a big part of the problems presented in the above links.\n\nAgain, something you might find useful if you want to actually educate yourself instead of spewing hateful nonsense on the internet:\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1AUdaH-EPM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1AUdaH-EPM)  \n\n\nIt's rare, but well done, you're someone who has successfully pissed me off on reddit.

The hospital has seen an increase in this.", "I agree with this post until the last part.  Instead of stooping to her level, take this to a different adult, like a teacher or counselor.  They *have* to take this seriously.", "My 9 year old is autistic and has made these noises almost exclusively since... as soon as she could make them, I guess. She's mostly nonverbal.", "So is she doing this around her friends and at school too? Because if not that's an easier way to call bullshit, and if yes, then the school really should be contacting your parents about it.", "My son has Tourette\u2019s, its a Syndrome that has a really tight classification for diagnosis, he sees paediatricians, neurologists, psychologist and neuro-physchiatrists in a pretty often schedule to help him improve daily functioning. it\u2019s a devastating syndrome that has always been the butt of jokes making it really difficult to be treated with kindness in society. This social media trend has made it 100 times worse.  He\u2019s 9yo he\u2019s never even been on TikTok. He often talks about \u2018not wanting to live anymore\u2019 because of how the public respond to him. It\u2019s devastating and cruel and the people seeking attention from it are furthering the heartache, not helping with awareness.", "Is this seriously a tiktoc trend!?!? Wtf is wrong with people!!", "No, she is doing what a ton of teen girls are doing right now, TikTok diagnosis and taking on mannerisms to prove it. She does need evaluation, because that\u2019s what finally helped us get it to stop. We could call it out with medical proof, and just like that, step daughters self diagnosed Tourettes magically disappeared.", "The problem is that many doctors and even governments take  an official diagnosis and use it as an excuse to strip away a person's rights. There's even a chance to be put on a \"Do Not Resuscitate\" list against your will if you're diagnosed with autism.\n\nAlso, if you live with symptoms long enough, you are likely able to properly identify your problem. \"Looks like a duck, walks like a duck.\" Meanwhile a doctor sees you for an hour every couple of months and, for many, disregards what you're saying because you don't \"act autistic.\"\n\nTalk with a therapist about it, sure, they can help you navigate that, but self diagnosis is extremely valuable.", "It's totally fine to not want to be referred to as neurodivergent. I was mostly taking issue with the idea that people who do call themselves that are just \"trying to feel special\", when that is not necessarily the case.", "This is becoming very common amongst teenage girls this age. The self diagnosis and acting out in the way they see whatever they have diagnosed themselves with is becoming more frequent, as claiming mental health diagnosis is the new counter culture.  \n\nMy step daughter decided she had Tourettes for the past six months. After some medical proof, she has been confronted by us and her therapists. Suddenly the Tourettes was gone! It\u2019s like a god damn miracle!/s\n\nShe tried a couple of times to reintroduce it, but she just gets shut down now. \n\nParents need to take her in because she is likely faking (due to this popping up after diagnosing herself via TikTok, and having restraint in public) but they will have the tools to call her out after she doesn\u2019t get a diagnosis. \n\nTrust, we tried the \u201cit\u2019s a phase, just ignore it\u201d thing, but what we realized was she was using this to get attention with peers, and her bigger issue is establishing relationships based on unhealthy foundations. Groups of friends that try to out do each other in who has the bigger diagnosis, who is more suicidal, etc. It lead her to purposefully overdose on her other meds, so she could tell her friends she went to the er and gain the dopamine hit of attention (she has admitted this since). She is now in residential home to work on these issues\u2026\n\nOP if you see this, please show your parents! Action needs to be taken before this behavior worsens and can end dangerously.", "We don't live in a perfect world sadly, but there are resources available for people who don't have insurance or insurance doesn't cover the cost of the diagnosis or treatment.", "I agree with seeking therapy. Obviously there are extreme things that can happen to people, but that shouldn't be the only reason why you don't seek medical help. Also, going to the right doctor or therapist is key. A general practitioner probably isn't the best to go to for an autism diagnosis and treatment (maybe for a referral if needed) unless they're trained. That's why you should seek out a specialist who is trained and works with people with autism.", "Either way, she really needs that diagnosis.  She isn\u2019t qualified to make the call.  Neither are you.  Neither am I.  Neither is anyone who isn\u2019t a specialist.", "Yeah definitely - agree with you there.", "People like that exist (such as OP's sister), and do real harm, but making a blanket statement like \"neurodivergent is just a way to feel special\" is harmful as well, because many actual autistic people use that term, and they still deserve to be taken seriously.\n\nThe same goes for the terms \"queer\" and \"non-binary\", and for the latter I'm not really sure what other term you would use. People also get accused of attention seeking for calling themselves more specific things like bigender, agender, genderfluid etc. so if you don't feel like a man or woman you basically can't win.", "I think they actually have found young people who did develop tics through the power of suggestion through viewing those TikToks (could honestly also be the trauma of Covid). That said, I do hope that more people who truly have neurodivergencies are getting support and help that they might not have previously .", "Yes, okay? The resources aren't endless and don't tend to be next-day. I'm lucky enough to have great insurance and live in a very urban area with lots of kinds of doctors in easy driving distance (or over video call, which is turning out to be a lifesaver for a lot of patients!), along with my own car and easily obtained PTO... and I still have a hell of a time getting certain on certain specialists' calendars. The system ain't great.\n\nIf someone says they're a textbook case for PTSD and that the related grounding techniques they've looked up have been super helpful, that sounds like someone who's on top of their shit; why is that a bad thing? The barriers they're experiencing in getting professional help ain't my business and I shouldn't judge them for not having overcome them yet.", "I explained the extreme to show how bad it can get, but there is tons in between. You can get treatment without official diagnosis of autism, although I'll admit, ADHD is more complicated as there are medications you need a diagnosis to obtain.\n\nI'd recommend looking up all the problems caused by an official autism diagnosis though. They range from medical discrimination to not being able to immigrate into other countries to being put on a DNR like I mentioned before. \n\nAnd given how far behind the medical communities in countries like the US actually are in terms of understanding autism, it can take a ton of work to find even a specialized therapist that knows what is actually helpful vs harmful for autistic people.", "OCD is also pretty popular. \nMy sister actually has OCD and hates it. Liking to be organized is *NOT* OCD, it\u2019s just liking things organized", "I was diagnosed at 36, about a year ago. I had no idea there was something driving my issues until I started seeing autism posts on Facebook. I was reluctantly suspicious, but it was really hard to find someone to diagnose an adult female...my family and friends were required to answer questions to confirm. \n\nBut knowing is always better than not knowing, though I won't get all those years back.", "You're preaching to the choir. I'm in the same boat have good insurance and find our healthcare system frustrating to navigate at times. Yes, resources aren't often easily come by or take time to get, but it doesn't take years. If it does than my apologies. \n\nThe OP was referring to their sister's self diagnosis of ADHD and autism. My response was to have their parents seek diagnosis and treatment for their daughter as OP believes their siblings may be making this up. Another redditor with similar issues was making a stink about my apparent \"abliest\" comments about self diagnosing. I don't necessarily have an issue with someone self diagnosing, but in order to treat the disorder with the help from anyone in the medical field you need a professional diagnosis. \n\nIn today's world people read something online and think they have the symptoms and self diagnose as such. Which may be ok for having a cold, flu or something else you can buy OTC medicine and treat. But it's another to say you have autism or ADHD when you haven't been diagnosed. Same goes for PTSD, depression and other mental health issues. At the end of the day what good is a diagnosis if you're not going to treat the issue? Which I believe is often the point for people to self diagnose for certain conditions as it allows them to say they have XYZ and use it as an excuse. Whereas if they wanted to treat the disorder they would seek the help of a medical professional. Sure they could research online for ways to manage it, which may be helpful but may also cause harm if it's not something they should be doing or taking.", "I'm so sad to know this is a thing. I hope they never have to truly experience a disassociative episode. It's a terrible feeling to know you're not in control, even if it's the mind's way of protecting us. I only experienced it once due to past trauma and now have to be constantly aware that it could happen again if I'm in a similar situation.", "Actually, none of us can mask 100% of the time. None of us. And home is actually the most common place to be able to relax the control and stim if we need to without fear of judgment. \n\nAlso, it's common for ASD and ADHD to have comorbid disorders. These can present additional symptoms or changes to existing symptoms. So no, we don't stay the same our entire life...that's wildly inaccurate."]}
