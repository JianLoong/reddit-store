{"id": 21933, "submission_id": "14wqwt8", "title": "AITA for telling her to never call my child annoying again and making her leave?", "selftext": "I've been seeing 29f \"Tasha\" for 2 years and she stays here with me (30m) pretty often these days. I have a 10yo daughter \"Anne\" who I have on a week on week off basis. Anne and Tasha do get along well but I've noticed that the more than Anne stays here, the more \"touched out\" she's becoming and losing patience quickly with my kid. Not in a mean way but it's getting under my skin a lot.\n\nSo like, my daughter loves people in general. She talks a lot and to be fair, a lot of it is her friend drama. She also makes a point to want you to watch everything she is watching on her tablet so frequently she will come up and be like \"watch this, it's so funny\" and most of the time it's not even remotely funny but she thinks it is and just wants to include people. Or she will stand directly behind you sometimes for no apparent reason and loves touching people. So at least 90% of the time that I have my daughter is quite literally a never ending conversation with very little time between not talking. Tasha is an introvert and needs more space than the normal introvert I've noticed. Which is great on weeks that we don't have my daughter because I love being able to sit here with her and just have a few hours without speaking at all but that's not possible on the weeks that we have my daughter.\n\nSo I picked up Anne on Sunday afternoon and by yesterday morning Tasha was acting weird.bshe said she didn't want to get up from bed to grab herself a coffee because \"as soon as Anne sees me in that kitchen she's going to come out and talk my ear off and I don't want to deal with it today. I'd like to wake up in peace.\" Okay, whatever, I go get her a coffee and set Anne up at the couch with the TV going to give Tasha some \"peace\". But 20 minutes later Anne comes in to our bedroom, sits on the edge of the bed and says \"so whatcha guys doing?\" Tasha just puts her coffee down and walks out of the room and says \"showering\". I go in to the bathroom to ask if she's good because she's acting weird and she goes \"no offense but Anne is super annoying. I don't know how anyone can talk that much and not get tired of their own voice. Love her but holy fuck is she annoying.\" I told her she better not ever call my kid annoying again and she just looks at me and says \"literally every fucking kid is annoying. I'm not being malicious. Your kid is annoying and you know it.\" So I told her to leave. She packed everything she had here and took off, without talking to Anne, who was asking what was going on, and now refuses to answer any of my texts or calls and has blocked me on social. AITA?\n\nETA: the reason why I freaked out was because my kid was in the other room and could have easily heard her say this had she been eavesdropping, which she sometimes does. I feel it's a conversation needed to be had when my kid isn't around. Tasha didn't say it to be malicious and I do know that. She made a point to not say it directly in front of my daughter but it still doesn't make it okay. Tasha does feel it's justified however because before she left that bathroom, she made a point to say \"your daughter literally tells me she loves annoying people and you're going to sit there and get pissed at me when I tell YOU that it's working. I will never communicate my frustrations with you again.\" Tasha does love Anne a lot and goes out of her way to plan things with Anne directly (like all day spa trips or mani/pedis for the two of them frequently), today was just weird.", "created_utc": 1689080818, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wqwt8/aita_for_telling_her_to_never_call_my_child/", "score": 15, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kids are annoying, that's just the way it is, and if she can't deal with that then she shouldn't date a dad.

You went papa bear, and that's what you're supposed to do.", "ESH.\n\nI get that Tasha needs space and silence. As an introvert, I sympathize. However, she has her own place as well, so if she needed some time away from the kid, she could have just taken a few days alone at her own place instead of lashing out.\n\nOn the other hand, you should teach your daughter that people need space sometimes and to not try to anny people on purpose or stand directly behind them. That it's okay for people to want to sit in silence for 10 minutes if they need, and that sometimes grownups are talking, and she should not interrupt.", "YTA, your kid needs something, she needs to learn to self play and that life doesn't revolve around her.

You knew your girlfriend wasn\u2019t in the mental state to deal with your daughter\u2019s constant conversation and yet let her come right on into the bedroom and sit down and start right in.  \nYour girlfriend shouldn\u2019t have insulted your daughter, which makes her suck, but then again she\u2019s not wrong.  It\u2019s not always the parent or parental figures job to engage and entertain a child.  It sounds like your daughter lakes the ability to keep herself entertained and occupied for any extended period of time, and that can get old really fast, especially for someone leaning towards the introvert side of things.\n\nSounds to me like you need to figure out how long you want to be single for because until you can teach your daughter that you and whomever you date don\u2019t need to be involved in absolutely every aspect of her life all time time, you\u2019re gonna continue down this path\u2026", "ESH, but you\u2019re a lot more the AH than Tasha is. \n\nTasha should not have said that your child is annoying where there was a chance Anne could overhear her.\n\nHowever, you need to face the reality that *your child is annoying.* Anne is ten years old, not a toddler!

At 10, she should be starting to learn that she can't always touch people, she doesn't get to dominate conversation 100% of the time, and that she can watch things on her own sometimes. It's great your daughter is such a people person, but if you don't teach her self-control, she is going to be a people repeller.\n\nYou really dropped the ball when your girlfriend made it clear she needed recharge time, and instead of helping to give it to her by scooping up your daughter and distracting her out of the bedroom, you instead poked the bear, and then blew up on her when she told you her feelings. \n\nTreasuring your daughter is 100% commendable, but you need to learn how to take care of your next girlfriend's feelings at the same time.

This entire post is a long, long list of the ways Anne annoys Tasha, some of which are clearly on purpose. How could you have typed this out and not realized how annoying Anne sounds? Tasha even made a point not to call Anne annoying in front of her and you still kicked her out in case your daughter was EAVESDROPPING. Seriously, wtf?", "NTA. Relationships are for a reason, a season or a lifetime. Tasha was for a season.\n\nMan oh man chatty 10 year olds can be irritating. I feel her. But that's what kids are like. An adult with better emotional skills would have 1) recognized that it was her problem not the kids and either started taking more alone time on kid weeks or told you that the relationship wasn't working for her instead of getting snitty with a child 2) had that conversation when your daughter wasn't in the other room. Kids have ears like bats and your daughter would have found that crushing.\n\nI think the relationship is over and probably for the best. You handled that like a parenting rock star. There's better relationships out there waiting for you and your kid.", "YTA a little. Anyone who has kids knows that they can be pretty annoying and Tasha has no obligations to put up with something that most parents struggle to endure too,  also knowing that Tasha is an introvert  there are things that can be done to make ends meet and imo a 10yo is able to understand that people some times needs space and what boundaries are. When you confronted her about her lack of patience you didn't even wanted to talk about it or understand her way, you just casted her out. Yeah, your kid is important, being a parent is hard, specially when is split like your case, but still.

This level of needing constant interaction and feedback is normal and healthy for a younger child, but at ten Anne needs to be learning how to entertain herself and give people space. And Tasha is entitled to space in her own home, which she communicated to OP without getting into the no-win situation of parenting a child who isn't hers. OP chose to not set or enforce boundaries with Anne, setting everyone up for failure.\n\nAnd if it hasn't happened already, Anne is going to start having social consequences outside of home for this kind of behavior. Other children are going to start pulling away from her and not including her because she's just too much for them. Teachers at school are going to start really pushing back on how disruptive constantly talking is in class. Anne will always be an extrovert, and it's normal for a child of parents who aren't together to need reassurance that they are wanted and loved. But everyone needs to learn some basic social skills in order to thrive in adulthood. Anne doesn't seem to be getting that, *especially* with non-consensual surprise touching.

You need to set some boundaries for your daughter. She cannot be the center of attention all the time. She cannot be allowed to monopolize other people\u2019s time.

Perhaps get her involved in outside activities, sports, or Girl Scouts. I would recommend talking to a counselor. \n\nYour girlfriend, on the other hand was simply trying to be honest with you and while she shouldn\u2019t call your daughter annoying, at least you know where she stands.
