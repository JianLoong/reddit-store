I have a 10yo daughter \"Anne\" who I have on a week on week off basis. Anne and Tasha do get along well but I've noticed that the more than Anne stays here, the more \"touched out\" she's becoming and losing patience quickly with my kid. Not in a mean way but it's getting under my skin a lot.\n\nSo like, my daughter loves people in general. She talks a lot and to be fair, a lot of it is her friend drama. She also makes a point to want you to watch everything she is watching on her tablet so frequently she will come up and be like \"watch this, it's so funny\" and most of the time it's not even remotely funny but she thinks it is and just wants to include people. Or she will stand directly behind you sometimes for no apparent reason and loves touching people. So at least 90% of the time that I have my daughter is quite literally a never ending conversation with very little time between not talking. Tasha is an introvert and needs more space than the normal introvert I've noticed. Which is great on weeks that we don't have my daughter because I love being able to sit here with her and just have a few hours without speaking at all but that's not possible on the weeks that we have my daughter.\n\nSo I picked up Anne on Sunday afternoon and by yesterday morning Tasha was acting weird.bshe said she didn't want to get up from bed to grab herself a coffee because \"as soon as Anne sees me in that kitchen she's going to come out and talk my ear off and I don't want to deal with it today. I'd like to wake up in peace.\" Okay, whatever, I go get her a coffee and set Anne up at the couch with the TV going to give Tasha some \"peace\". But 20 minutes later Anne comes in to our bedroom, sits on the edge of the bed and says \"so whatcha guys doing?\" Tasha just puts her coffee down and walks out of the room and says \"showering\". I go in to the bathroom to ask if she's good because she's acting weird and she goes \"no offense but Anne is super annoying. I don't know how anyone can talk that much and not get tired of their own voice. Love her but holy fuck is she annoying.\" I told her she better not ever call my kid annoying again and she just looks at me and says \"literally every fucking kid is annoying. I'm not being malicious. Your kid is annoying and you know it.\" So I told her to leave. She packed everything she had here and took off, without talking to Anne, who was asking what was going on, and now refuses to answer any of my texts or calls and has blocked me on social. AITA?\n\nETA: the reason why I freaked out was because my kid was in the other room and could have easily heard her say this had she been eavesdropping, which she sometimes does. I feel it's a conversation needed to be had when my kid isn't around. Tasha didn't say it to be malicious and I do know that. She made a point to not say it directly in front of my daughter but it still doesn't make it okay. Tasha does feel it's justified however because before she left that bathroom, she made a point to say \"your daughter literally tells me she loves annoying people and you're going to sit there and get pissed at me when I tell YOU that it's working. I will never communicate my frustrations with you again.\" Tasha does love Anne a lot and goes out of her way to plan things with Anne directly (like all day spa trips or mani/pedis for the two of them frequently), today was just weird.", "created_utc": 1689080818, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wqwt8/aita_for_telling_her_to_never_call_my_child/", "score": 803, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kids are annoying, that's just the way it is, and if she can't deal with that then she shouldn't date a dad. As parents, we get to call our kids annoying, but I don't know **any** parent who's going to be OK with hearing \"your kid is fucking annoying\" about their child from someone else. You went papa bear, and that's what you're supposed to do.", "ESH.\n\nI get that Tasha needs space and silence. As an introvert, I sympathize. However, she has her own place as well, so if she needed some time away from the kid, she could have just taken a few days alone at her own place instead of lashing out.\n\nOn the other hand, you should teach your daughter that people need space sometimes and to not try to anny people on purpose or stand directly behind them. That it's okay for people to want to sit in silence for 10 minutes if they need, and that sometimes grownups are talking, and she should not interrupt.", "YTA, your kid needs something, she needs to learn to self play and that life doesn't revolve around her.

It\u2019s not always the parent or parental figures job to engage and entertain a child.  It sounds like your daughter lakes the ability to keep herself entertained and occupied for any extended period of time, and that can get old really fast, especially for someone leaning towards the introvert side of things.\n\nSounds to me like you need to figure out how long you want to be single for because until you can teach your daughter that you and whomever you date don\u2019t need to be involved in absolutely every aspect of her life all time time, you\u2019re gonna continue down this path\u2026", "ESH, but you\u2019re a lot more the AH than Tasha is. \n\nTasha should not have said that your child is annoying where there was a chance Anne could overhear her.\n\nHowever, you need to face the reality that *your child is annoying.* Anne is ten years old, not a toddler!

This entire post is a long, long list of the ways Anne annoys Tasha, some of which are clearly on purpose. How could you have typed this out and not realized how annoying Anne sounds?

Relationships are for a reason, a season or a lifetime. Tasha was for a season.\n\nMan oh man chatty 10 year olds can be irritating. I feel her. But that's what kids are like. An adult with better emotional skills would have 1) recognized that it was her problem not the kids and either started taking more alone time on kid weeks or told you that the relationship wasn't working for her instead of getting snitty with a child 2) had that conversation when your daughter wasn't in the other room. Kids have ears like bats and your daughter would have found that crushing.\n\nI think the relationship is over and probably for the best. You handled that like a parenting rock star. There's better relationships out there waiting for you and your kid.", "YTA a little. Anyone who has kids knows that they can be pretty annoying and Tasha has no obligations to put up with something that most parents struggle to endure too,  also knowing that Tasha is an introvert  there are things that can be done to make ends meet and imo a 10yo is able to understand that people some times needs space and what boundaries are. When you confronted her about her lack of patience you didn't even wanted to talk about it or understand her way, you just casted her out.

This level of needing constant interaction and feedback is normal and healthy for a younger child, but at ten Anne needs to be learning how to entertain herself and give people space.

OP chose to not set or enforce boundaries with Anne, setting everyone up for failure.\n\nAnd if it hasn't happened already, Anne is going to start having social consequences outside of home for this kind of behavior. Other children are going to start pulling away from her and not including her because she's just too much for them. Teachers at school are going to start really pushing back on how disruptive constantly talking is in class. Anne will always be an extrovert, and it's normal for a child of parents who aren't together to need reassurance that they are wanted and loved. But everyone needs to learn some basic social skills in order to thrive in adulthood. Anne doesn't seem to be getting that, *especially* with non-consensual surprise touching. If that one lasts into puberty Anne is going to have some massive problems.\n\nAnne isn't a bad child, but she is at the point where she needs guidance as she starts to transition into the next phase of childhood and puberty.", "This should be the top answer.", "I have to agree with this because even you say she talks constantly. You need to set some boundaries for your daughter. She cannot be the center of attention all the time. She cannot be allowed to monopolize other people\u2019s time. I don\u2019t know if she needs to find friends or hobbies, but she does need to figure out how to occupy her time. How is her behavior in school, does she talk nonstop? Perhaps get her involved in outside activities, sports, or Girl Scouts. I would recommend talking to a counselor. \n\nYour girlfriend, on the other hand was simply trying to be honest with you and while she shouldn\u2019t call your daughter annoying, at least you know where she stands. If she\u2019s not able to tolerate your daughter and her idiosyncrasies and you are not willing to set boundaries, then you need to reconsider the relationship.", "Opie I would say NTA, but firstly you and Tasha was it or not very compatible especially with you having an energetic daughter and secondly I think you should try to teach a daughter about when to talk much I want to not talk at all.

It is so hard being an introvert and having someone who needs to constantly be near you and talk at you. I am an introvert with a high touch extroverted child. It is exhausting and really annoying at times.

It won't end well.", "So as a 40f who loves kids I\u2019m going to say YTA. Your daughter needs to be taught boundaries which you aparently are not doing. It\u2019s not okay for anyone, no matter their age, to just stand behind someone for no reason. And it\u2019s cool that she likes physical touch but she needs to be taught consent because not everyone wants to be touched all the time.

I have three kids under five and I get touched out so they have been taught that when someone says space you give them space.

How do you gauge that?\n\nAs an introvert myself who actually prefers to be alone, even just sitting in a room with another person and not talking is still too much after awhile.\n\nI just dealt with this because I was in the hospital. My parents would visit EVERY DAY, sometimes more than once (morning and evening). But nothing was new in anyone's life so we had nothing to talk about. So we'd sit there in silence and I'd give them the TV remote and say \"turn on whatever you want\". But they'd stay for HOURS sometimes. I finally had to break it down that while I love them, I need my alone time and them just being there makes me uncomfortable and anxious. I told them that their visits weren't really for me, but for themselves and that's not how it's supposed to be. And it was unfair because I was completely captive. When I visit their house, I can leave the room, or leave the house whenever I want; I was trapped in my hospital room and there was no escape. I'm sure there were some hurt feelings though they never admitted it. They said they understood, but still tried to come visit every other day. Two visits a week is plenty. And about all I could stand.\n\nSo, when you say she needs more space than a normal introvert, whatever that means, but don't take steps to stop your daughter from harassing her and let her have that space, yeah, eventually she's gonna get fed up and say something hurtful. \n\nIt seems like even though you understand she's an introvert, you weren't sensitive to that or bothered trying to teach your daughter to be sensitive of it either.

If you\u2019re incapable of speaking with your daughter or letting your girlfriend vent then this relationship is doomed. You kicked her out for expressing her emotions WHEN YOU ASKED!", "You\u2019re assuming it would be a terrible thing but it might\u2019ve been very good for Anne if she was eavesdropping  to hear Tasha say that - even if it stings. Tasha obviously doesn\u2019t feel free to say it to her face in a real conversation. As Tasha said you know she\u2019s annoying and someone needs to tell her she\u2019s annoying rather than pandering to it. \n\nThis is a classic kid from a split family issue. They don\u2019t get truly  good parenting because both parents, either out of guilt or whatever, are treating them with kid gloves. Someone needs to tell Anne she\u2019s annoying which is not funny or cute and not respecting boundaries and if you\u2019re not then she will have to learn this from other people whether it\u2019s from Tasha or someone crueler at school etc. and it will hurt her far more from others teaching her this than coming from you who she knows loves her. \n\nTasha is your guest.  It\u2019s becoming her home too to your advantage and if she\u2019s choosing to stay there with you  and she\u2019s expected to have a kid around half the time that is not hers there every other week that gets old and you never get into a rhythm but rather a  constantly bouncing back-and-forth readjusting \u2013 that\u2019s a tough situation for anyone. \n\nThe back-and-forth also creates what I call the backdoor syndrome that divorced children fall into where as soon as they don\u2019t like the rules or start to get any real parenting at one house, they simply bounce back to the other, playing this back-and-forth, and at that point their maturity stops developing because they\u2019re never forced to grow and change from a situation that forces them to grow and change. They often won\u2019t  like rules  that are ultimately the best thing for them.\n\nOn top of that any anyone who is honest knows kids can be very  annoying. The difference is when a husband and wife have raised the child from birth it\u2019s less shocking when you say that about your own  child than when someone else from the outside says it. Both my husband and I have said that about our own child to each other, more than once, and the other one instead of taking offense and kicking the other person out of the house, which is what you did, simply nods in understanding, agrees and gives the other a big hug. \n\nWe\u2019ve had exchange students come as teenagers into our home as well as our own child. What I learned is taking on someone else\u2019s teen without any historical background with each other  is much harder than raising your own child which with you have years of developing a shared understanding. You need to realize you\u2019re asking this of any partner whom you wish to keep you company, realize that is a lot to ask of anyone to expect them to raise a child not their own always perfectly with a smile on their face never and loosing it. Even birth parents can\u2019t uphold this impossibly high standard.  Realize you are coming along with what single people frankly call baggage. That\u2019s a lot to ask of someone and in return you need to approach them with extra compassion,  understanding and tolerance. In a fact, you betrayed Tasha by not supporting her when all you had to do was give her a hug and say I know honey.\n\nYou will need to learn how to navigate this. If you want a relationship with Tasha or anyone you\u2019re going to get yourself in trouble by prioritizing your daughter over her. You need to figure out a way to balance both so that both of their needs are met - Tasha\u2019s needs clearly are not being met right now. Anne desperately needs to learn boundaries and it sounds like no one\u2019s bothering to teach her that. Step up with your parenting and your loving. You would have to do a complete 180 with Tasha right now with a sincere major apology and major stance shift in order to save things - the fact you\u2019re asking if YTA and framing it the way you did shows you\u2019re not ready for that yet. But guarantee you\u2019ll eventually run into the same issue with the next person you date.

You can hardly hear yourself think sometimes.\n\nBut Anne is a kid, and she has a need. If you shut her down too much she's gonna internalize that and it can be unhealthy growing up, she could end up in abusive relationships. Also if you want her to talk to you about the important stuff later on, you have to listen to the pointless stuff now. Because it's not pointless to her. If you shut it down now, all she's gonna learn is \"this person does not want to know about me\". There's no important or unimportant for Anne.\n\nIt's possible to enforce boundaries though! With my daughter, we have a very strict \"you let me have breakfast in peace\" rule, she knows to come to us only if it's really important, otherwise it's \"go play in your things and come back to see me in 15 minutes\". We also have more than 1 kid, so we will also shut her down when she's suddenly talking over someone else or interrupting a conversation or something, and that's fine. They have to learn to respect others and talking orders too! But her turn to talk does have to come eventually. If you explain things calmly to them, they are able to understand that \"I'm tired and I don't feel like talking right now\". But they're not mind readers.\n\nYou are NTA. Tasha is. Not because of how she feels, but because of how she handled it. She didn't enforce any boundaries, she just let it pile on and on until she blew up, and nobody ever deals with thing well when they blow up.

If she does, you should apologize for your unfair overreaction and make sure that she has a safe zone in her own home.", "This comment makes me wonder if you yourself have ever been assessed for if you might fall on the spectrum/have ADHD/etc? I say this as someone with many wonderful autists in my family and friend group, and who worked with kids who were diagnosed, and parents who had never been, but simply because it was before neuropsych testing was widespread. \n\nOr might you yourself just not have been raised to consider other people\u2019s needs? Not just Tasha\u2019s here (for some head space to start her day and brace for dealing with Anne), but Anne\u2019s, to have a parent be able to do the painful loving work of correcting her behavior? Not just her socially inappropriate interaction style, but that she\u2019s on screens all the time, can\u2019t self-entertain, emotionally lives at the level of gossip, etc. How do you guide conversations with your daughter- or do you just let her talk at you? Do you ask her questions to help her elaborate on her descriptions, build her skills in storytelling and go deeper into her feelings and the feelings of others? Because that will help her development and also to be easier for others to tolerate talking to. \n\nAs a teacher, I\u2019d probably have flagged your daughter as one of the kids I was concerned about, both for social reasons (she told Tasha she likes to annoy people- is she bullying or being bullied? She touches people inappropriately- that is Not Okay) and for academic ones, if she\u2019s not reading extensively. \n\nTasha sounds like she\u2019s really gone above and beyond to cultivate a relationship with your daughter, and you denied her her ability to take care of her basic needs or set any boundaries. She\u2019s also watching you deny your daughter the parenting she needs- I wouldn\u2019t expect Tasha to come back, and I would recommend you look for some counseling and read/listen up on things about parenting and child development so you and Anne can both ultimately be happier and more successful in relationships.", "You done fucked up with a good woman then. She is absolutely allowed to want to have a quiet moment and you completely disrespected her, invalidated her feelings while also setting your daughter up for social failure. \n\nI wouldn't come back after being kicked out for voicing an absolutely valid need. \"But still\" is an excuse used by middle schoolers, grow up. \n\nYTA, both to your girlfriend AND your daughter. You've set them both up for failure, your relationship health and daughters social skills have both suffered because of your lack of boundaries and empathy.", "Your child is annoying, teach her boundaries. You probably lost Tasha since you dismissed her concerns and now you\u2019re blocked. Help your daughter work on her annoying social skills. I love kids but no one wants to be bombarded with someone who needs nonstop attention and won\u2019t stop talking. I know 4 year olds that have learned how to stop doing this. YTA", "She could\u2019ve been less harsh by\u2026 not suddenly dropping this on OP while annoying ass Anne is in the room next door. Granted, there may have been convos about boundaries before but as it stands, Tasha walked away and said \u201cyour kid sucks\u201d to OP kinda outta the blue. Obviously OP and his daughter suck, but Tasha could\u2019ve handled this in a classier way. \n\nI\u2019m not saying I\u2019d have done better, but this is AITA not \u201ccan I understand why this person was upset\u201d lol.", "this! I don\u2019t get the whole drama because she said the kid was annoying. Even if she heard it\u2026 When my daughter was ten and talking nonstop after me showing her that I need some rest I told her in a friendly way that she should stop being so annoying. People stop pampering their kids so much, they\u2018ll get into trouble later if they don\u2019t learn to respect boundaries", "Saying \"literally every kid is fucking annoying\" is.", "This all of this why can't he keep her occupied and why is it so bad of her to need time to herself", "I agree after a re-read. I think what my problem was here was that I couldn't find a place where the two of them talked about this BEFORE Tasha started wildly walking into other rooms as soon as the kid showed up.", "Soon she\u2019s going to be a closed off teenager who never says anything to either of her parents. OP is allowed to enjoy her chatty phase while it lasts.", "So you're saying EHS because they can't communicate or plan visits instead of the reason I said? \n\n6 of one, half dozen of the other", "Not knowing when OP and Anne's mother split, I'm willing to give some grace for how old Anne has gotten without getting the guidance she needs. If the split was happening in early elementary school, both parents likely had other battles to fight to make sure Anne stayed happy and healthy when many other children are learning these skills. But learning basic social cues and personal boundaries cannot be put off any longer without some significant consequences for Anne.", "I love my kid to the moon and back but holy smokes she would talk the ear off a dead person. Sometimes I have to lock myself in the bathroom just for 2 minutes of peace and quiet. When she was in school it was awesome, but summer break is here and I\u2019m already going bonkers.", "There's probably a reason Anne is talking about friend drama. It's not unlikely that she's creating some of it with her behaviour.", "They don\u2019t know how to respect boundaries because they have never been taught and they come from homes where boundaries are non existent or they are so strict he be unattainable.  It\u2019s called emotional neglect. They may be taken care of in every other way but to live a life with no boundaries is setting them up for a hard life ahead.", "And their teachers will react the same way, but b/c everyone around them pulls back they don't even realize that's not a normal reaction. They get deeper and deeper in their own constant talking and don't even realize the other people aren't participating in the conversation.", "They live together.", "Yes, this is what makes it ESH to me. Anne needs boundaries, but Tasha could also stay at her own place sometimes if she wants peace and is overwhelmed.", "Yeah she's definitely getting told she's annoying elsewhere and leaning into it because she wants attention but also doesn't know what she's doing wrong. Or she just doesn't care because it still gets her attention.", "The person you responding to is mentioning how OP says his daughter is constantly watching things on the tablet and trying to get others to watch it too. Implying they are a tablet parent.", "Yep. My 11 year old does like attention and sometimes I do have to be like \u201cbro. I told you 5 times now that I need some space cause I\u2019m working/doing laundry/trying to shower\u201d cause she\u2019s a kid, but she is also constantly outside playing with her friends or blaring music in her bedroom. \n\nAt 10, they\u2019re going to be annoying sometimes, but they\u2019re old enough to have boundaries.", "Oh my God, this sounds like one of my friends. She will text me paragraphs of overexplained information that I can only stand to skim through and will text me every little thought that pops in her head. Stuff like \"This woman at the store just...\" and \"This guy sitting in the waiting room is doing something weird.\" She does the same thing with all her social media, like Facebook and SnapChat. I've been trying to get across to her that not everyone wants to hear every thought that crosses her mind and that her long-winded explanations can be shortened to 1-2 sentences.", "I think thats the main issue with this post, OP is doing absolutely 0 to correct behaviour that he knows is driving his gf insane", "I work with kids full time - all day. Yes listening to the chatter is part of caring for them, but it\u2019s also okay for another person in the household to set reasonable boundaries and need some quiet time. Tasha didn\u2019t take it out on the kid, she made a reasonable attempt to have her needs met without hurting Anne\u2019s feelings by removing herself from the situation.\n\nI think the previous poster here is right - her father should have been like - hey Anne, GF needs some quiet time for a minute and redirected her at that point to a self directed activity or gone out and chatted with her while Tasha took her time.\n\nIf Tasha wasn\u2019t actively planning outings with Anne and making sure she felt loved and cared for I\u2019d say maybe the relationship wasn\u2019t for them, but that\u2019s not the case. She\u2019s asking for a half hour of quiet.", "Absolutely right! Children are born little savages who need to be civilized. So many people don't want to invest the time it takes to address socially incorrect behavior and teach them how to behave.", "he\u2019s a man, that\u2019s why he leaves it all to Tasha to deal with", "Tasha walked away and said \u201cshowering.\u201d OP followed her into the bathroom and demanded to know what her issue was like it was some big mystery, even though she had made her need for space very clear. If OP hadn\u2019t asked, the conversation wouldn\u2019t have happened at that place and time. Also the concern that Anne might be eavesdropping is another Anne problem. Tasha did nothing wrong.", "Dude, every kid is annoying. They're kids, that's part of it. The role of a parent is to teach them other people have feelings too.", "It's hilarious to me the amount of people saying she's childish and must hate children because she wanted her partner to respect her boundary? Like there's literally a bluey episode (which is a kids tv show) where the mom asks the dad to keep the kids entertained because she doesn't have the energy to talk to anyone at the moment. The whole episode is about how it's normal for some people to need time to themselves and that should be respected, needing time to yourself doesn't mean you hate the other person.", "You are right.\n\nAnne's behavior could also be a result of the splitting of her parents. Seek as much attention as you can in the limited time you have with mom or dad. No matter what, it is a sensible subject and OP and Anne's mother should discuss how they want to treat it. Anne should in no way feel punished, unloved or not welcome. But she needs to understand that people can be annoyed by certain behavior.\n\n Especially towards Tasha she needs to respect her boundaries, because Tasha is not one of Anne's parents, therefore needs more privacy, like not entering the bedroom Tasha and OP share.", "Not necessarily. My husband was this way as a kid and he was taught boundaries, he just didn\u2019t care about them because his ADHD caused a lack of impulse control. He never felt like he could slow down enough until he was medicated for the first time.", "\u201cShe stays here with me pretty often these days\u201d to me sounds like she has her own place but chooses to stay at his house often.", "It's most likely people at school. 10 is actually a bit past when people stop wanting to deal with the annoying kids, especially if they're girls. 10 is typically when things first start getting cliquey", "I am a mum to 2 and step mum to 2 and let me tell you all  my children irritate me to the point I don't wanna hear the sound of their voice for a bit because people get over stimulated people are allowed to be annoyed if someone (yes even a child) won't shut up n give them a break he might be okie with never hearing silence when his child's their doesn't mean everyone else hasto be", "There\u2019s a difference between \u201cchattering\u201d and \u201cwill keep following you to continue the conversation\u201d. If OP doesn\u2019t teach his kid or find another way to occupy her attention, this will continue all the way into adulthood when people are less likely to tolerate this.", "LMAO great point here. He mentions the woman loves his daughter and does fun things with her but the MOMENT she appears human and needs a break he kicks her out. \n\nMassive asshole. \nYTA op", "Please. \ud83d\ude44", "Plus, Anne's parents have known her since she was a baby and have learned to adjust to her level of activity. For someone who is used to their own space, it can be a hard adjustment to have someone around ALL the time, even if she weren't needing constant attention."]}
