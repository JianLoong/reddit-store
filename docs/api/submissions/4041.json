Sounds like she harbors some resentment that u moved away but that\u2019s her problem not yours. U R ABSOLUTELY NOT WRONG! Mom sees them everyday but her daughter just lost her child & almost her life, that trumps graduation. I\u2019m a lil surprised sis didn\u2019t say u should go cuz my sis really needs! Shame on them for not showing u the love & support u need & deserve. I have some shitty fam but decided the ppl around me who love & support me may not be blood but they\u2019re my chosen family. Blood isn\u2019t thicker than water when there is love mixed in. U have loving supportive ppl around u, lean on them. I\u2019m very sorry for your loss & the extra pain your family has added to the situation. Have a blessed holiday with those who r by your side! \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA NTA NTA idk how much I can stress that. Your true family is who is with you now blood or not. Honestly I feel for you, I had a scary experience and almost died when giving birth to my son through emergency c section. He is alive thank heavens and he is two now\u2026I\u2019m sorry for your loss and your mother is the worse if she can\u2019t muster to care about you like that. Honestly she makes it sound like a chore from your post and that isn\u2019t how anyone should treat their child no matter they are an adult now or not. I\u2019m gonna be in Brazil for two years and my own mother is already talking about visiting me while using the excuse of bring my cat for me when they start allowing them to come to Brazil again. I haven\u2019t even left yet, spend the holidays with those beside you who truly care! They are your real family", "This breaks my heart.\n\nI'm sorry that your mom is not making any effort to be there for you for the good times, and the worst of times. \n\nIt might be best to go no contact for a while. Focus on your husband, kids, friends, and of course, yourself. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nNTA", "NTA", "As a mother, you couldn\u2019t keep me away from my daughter- ESPECIALLY if she was having a child or suffering the loss of her baby. \n\nYou deserve better and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.\n\nMy father basically abandoned me when I became an adult. We lived two states away and he never even bothered to come see me or meet his grandkids. Up to a point I did all the traveling/calling  and then finally just stopped. When he passed away- I hardly grieved his loss- I was far more hurt by his apathy. His behavior ended our relationship and I learned to cling to those that want me in their lives. You shouldn\u2019t have to beg your parents to love you.", "NTA\n\nYou can see who they favor, and it is clear that even if you are paying she is not interested.  However Op, what I will tell you is that you should keep this in mind, cause you never know but one day she may call you cause she wants to see you, or how she loves you and it will be cause she wants something from you.  Then you will have to decide if her treatment of you in the past is worth giving her what she wants.", "OP=NTA\n\nBut recognize that you do have more than children and husband.  Your church friend and husband went out of their way.  So you look to have a bigger \"created\" family than you may recognize.\n\nI'm sorry that you went through all this and I hope you have recovered from your surgery and that there were not any permanent complications.", "NTA\nYour church friend sounds nice.\nI'm glad you live where you are fully accepted, appreciated and supported. I hope you can \"drop the rope\" with yr mom and let her start being the one making an effort to support yr relationship with her. Sounds like the old one sucks. If you get to forge a new, grown up relationship with her, please do it gradually and with BOUNDARIES. Don't push yourself past your comfort zone. \nWait until you feel safe where you are before considering increasing communication and contact.", "I read your story to my wife, who immediately replied \u201cwow. You know how that feels.\u201d I\u2019ve lived on the East Coast of the US for 12 years and my mother has never come to see me- she lives on the West Coast. I\u2019ve had cancer, I developed seizures (now under control but once an unknown disorder), I got married. Nothing. I ended up going out to that coast recently to see my pregnant best friend and it was pulling teeth to get her to drive 75 minutes to see me. \n\nThe simple matter is that some parents are good parents only when it\u2019s convenient. You aren\u2019t convenient, so she\u2019s not a good parent. I\u2019m so sorry she failed you and I\u2019m so sorry you don\u2019t have the mom you need. You are not the asshole in any way and please do what you can to take it slow as you recover. \n\nI\u2019ve also found therapy helpful when dealing with the harm my mother has done to me. Considering the circumstances, it\u2019ll be extra helpful for you right now. NTA and good luck.", "I was always an afterthought and my mother has never asked about my children or my grandchildren. It took me years but I finally went NC and my older sister tried to berate me for it. But of course the golden child will always stand up for the parent/parents that treat them and their kids like they are the best", "My blood still lives in the US (we in Europe). Ever since we moved closer to my wife\u2019s family, mine keeps saying: when are you coming home for a vacation so we can see you?\n\n1. Going home is not a vacation\n\n2.

She behaves much better because of it, but we're all some level of low contact which also helps"]}
