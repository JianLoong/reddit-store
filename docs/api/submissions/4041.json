I\u2019ve lived here for almost 15 years. I married here and had two children. When I first got pregnant, I begged my mom to come and stay with me for a couple of weeks as I was going to give birth to my first child and her first grandchild. We\u2019d pay for her ticket of course but she said it wasn\u2019t her problem that I decided to have a baby on the other side of the world and she couldn\u2019t come anyway because she had work and studies.\n\nI sadly had a miscarriage last month and almost died from complications  (haemorrhaged severely, went into cardiac arrest and had to undergo emergency surgery to save my life). \n\nI was telling a friend from church about it later and how after a scary situation in life even as a grownup I still wished for a mummy cuddle. My friend called me a couple of days later and very kindly said she and her husband would like to pay for a ticket for my mom to come so we could spend the holidays together. \n\nI called my mom who told me her passport was expired and a new one will only be ready by mid January. Oh that kinda sucks I thought but I guess I can wait a bit more. \nBut then she told me that she can only come in February after my sister\u2019s graduation. \n\nAt this point I became so upset. Ive lived here 15 years and not once did anyone bother to come and visit me. Its always my husband and I paying to go and see them at least once a year. \n\nThey\u2019ve always had each other for events like these. My parents were there for my sisters\u2019 marriages, first births, holidays, when they\u2019re ill or going through hard times. I haven\u2019t had that and dealt with every difficult situation with only my husband by my side.\n\nI told her not to bother anymore and cancelled her ticket. Even almost dying is still not enough to get her to leave things for a while and come stay with her eldest daughter for a few weeks. I\u2019ll spend the holidays with the only people who seem to care about me: my children and my husband.\n\nAITA? Guess I needed to vent a little.\n\nEdit: Thank you everyone so much for reading and responding to my post. I didn\u2019t expect this post to blow up like this. \nI think I\u2019m ready to accept that my family moved on and I\u2019m not exactly a priority - more of a second/third thought. \nI did think that paying for a ticket (again) would have been enough for my mom to want come visit since all she needed to was pack and drive the 20 minutes to the airport (plus as a South American, a trip to England is very much the trip of a lifetime).\nIt\u2019s a sad realisation that you\u2019re not as nearly as important to your family as you imagined but I guess at least now I can move on.\nThank you all so much for the good wishes, the lovely messages of encouragement and reality checks. I appreciate it.

My in-laws live 20 mins away and my parents claim we have showed \"favoritism\" to them because we visit with them much much more often and use them for babysitting much more often, and then get really mad when I tell them \"You moved 3 hours away, 5-6 hours round trip, and I TOLD you this was going to happen because that changes how often we will be able to come see you\". \n\nExtrapolate that out across the entire world and while I don't really agree with not seeing you for 15 YEARS, I can imagine that it might not be in the budget or they might not have the time off.\n\nIt's a sad situation, but ultimately this is all a result of something you chose to do, and you have to own your part in that and then react to their decisions based on your decision.", "NTA. So sorry for what happened OP. Please, take your time to recover and stay away from this hampering your mental health.\n\n*virtual hug*", "I agree, but there are plenty of other excuses other than just paying for a flight. Many people have plans, work, school, or other obligations they have agreed to that they might have a hard time dropping unexpectedly for several weeks at the last minute.\n\nNow, whether or not any of those apply to OP's mom I couldn't tell you, but there are plenty of valid excuses beyond the cost of the flight.", "I guess there\u2019s a chance it could be that but my parents have flown before and my mom went to Paris a few years before I came to the UK.", "My son - their first grandchild was born in 2017, that\u2019s when I first begged mom to come. My sisters had children after that.", "Yeah, this was my thoughts as well. She's NTA for how they're reacting to her invitations, but picking up on very short notice and traveling across the world is not something most people can reasonably do, and it's not surprising someone would suggest planning something like that for a few months down the line when they might not have anything scheduled or whatever.\n\nMy parents moved away and give me endless shit for not being able to see my kids as often as my in-laws (who still live 20 mins away) even though I specifically told them that this was going to happen because a 5 or 6 hour round trip drive wasn't something I was going to be willing or able to do other than a few times a year.", "My heart goes out to you.\nIt feels like a big rejection and also a betrayal - which is plain horrible even in the best of days.", "My husband does have family here but unfortunately they\u2019re much worse than mine. He had to cut contact with them a while ago (a whole \u2018nother story). But you\u2019re definitely right about seeking relationships with older ladies in church. I think that\u2019s a great idea and will definitely try that.", "My mental health went up after I went completely NC with my womb incubator/eggdonor.\n\nYour future self will thank your past self for going NC, trust me. Forget them and keep your chosen family around you.", "Consider therapy love. Advice is correct here about moving on, but moving on from parents will always hurt. And you just got out of something scary and very sad. So along with husband and friends, put another person in your corner, someone to help you navigate the pain.", "Ouch. So sorry that hear that.", "is your mother able to pack up and leave her life for several weeks?", "Yep. Explained that perfectly. \nEven when we did go on holiday I felt like a stuck out like sore thumb. Sucks that there\u2019s no effort to come at least once, see what your life looks like\u2026 My family always say that yes it\u2019s too expensive but in 15 years they could have saved enough money for at least a couple of tickets.", "I feel like this as well and when I moved out their plan went through the window.", "NAH. It sounds like your mom is hurt by your decision to relocate, and she\u2019s put up emotional boundaries as a result. Of course she favors your sisters now. They\u2019re part of her life. They\u2019re going to be there to take care of her as she ages. You can\u2019t be, because your life is elsewhere. It\u2019s not fair of you to expect your relationship with her to be the same when you choose to leave.", "INFO:\n\nSo let me get this straight: You're upset because your mother, who lives in a different country, can't simply drop everything, cancel previous commitments, and rush to your side, on your schedule, because you want a hug?", "I'm an expat living a solid 13hr flight away from home for over 12 years now. I love my parents and they are both very loving to me in most of the ways that count and we do keep in regular contact via Facebook/messenger. But my dad has yet to come visit me here. My mom is too afraid to travel alone so she came with me 12 years ago when I first moved (her family is from here and she has aunts/cousins here but I don't have contact with them outside of her) and once in 2017 with my sister(her only visit) and aunts to visit me a bit, but also visit the extended family here. My brother came once the first year I moved (my aunt paid for it as a graduation gift for him).  I try to go home once every year and it's expensive. But apparently it's ok for me to save and spend but not for them (they are all very capable of saving and covering the cost of a visit). Also in the 12 years I've lived here I've received exactly 0 phone calls from home. I always have to be the one to call there, they all claim not to know how to dial the international number to contact me, after like 6 years of writing it down for them multiple times I just gave up. My parents have been 'planning a visit' since 2016 but always end up going on a trip somewhere else instead. Not gonna lie, this shit hurts, and deeply. I feel like I've grown a whole life here and become a whole different person and I want to share that with them and share my world and why I love this place. But it's like they just don't care enough to be bothered with a 13 hr flight. It really sucks and makes me feel unloved sometimes.", ">At this point I became so upset. Ive lived here 15 years and not once did anyone bother to come and visit me. Its always my husband and I paying to go and see them at least once a year. \n\nNTA. If I were you, I'd stop visiting them and spend that money for a nice holiday with your family (husband and kids) as they're the ones that love and support you. Your mom has clearly move on, so should you.", "I am very sorry for your loss.  I wish I could be there to give you hugs and love.  Have a wonderful Holiday season with your family!", "NTA.  While I can see that if your mother is not fond of traveling or flying (fearful etc) that she might put off seeing you and never manage to make it happen, though that's pretty lousy to never ever visit and see your home and new country, etc.  But... if my daughter had a traumatic experience and nearly died, I'd be there ASAP!  I think I'd just stay put in my own country for a while and give excuses as to why you can't come and see if your mom gets tired of that.  Then you can say \"exactly how I feel\".", "As the daughter that chose to move away, I totally understand this, albeit just within the US. My dad always held it against me that I chose to leave my home state and move half way across the country, the only time he ever visited was when my sister had a destination wedding near me, and that was 15 years after leaving home. He's passed away now, but he wouldn't have never come unless it was for a wedding. \nMy mom (they were divorced) has been a bit better since I had a child (at age 38, so about 20 yrs after I moved!) but up until then, she had only visited me one other time. \nMy twin sister has a college aged daughter close to me now and has been to visit her about 3x a year. I was just recounting how when I moved to college, I had a broken foot and nobody helped me move across the country or visit me the entire time I was in college. \nIt's been interesting as my 80 yr old mom reflects now, she acknowledges that I was the one that always got the shaft, mostly because I wasn't pushy and was independent, where as my sisters got more because they demanded things of her (time with grandkids, money for weddings/ college).\nI just wanted you to know that it hurts, but it'll be ok. Be happy that you have a husband, kids and friends that love and appreciate you. Hopefully your mom will reflect someday like mine has, the acknowledgement made me feel a bit better.", "There must be thousands of us. \ud83d\ude1e", "Likely millions. I am very much opposed to preaching needing relation because of a lineage coincidence", "You probably wouldn't have to do anything for no contact, and they probably won't notice. Don't worry though, they will contact you when they need money or something, I'll bet.", "Yes it HURTS", "Thanks for the clarification!", "Lineage means Nothing when they don\u2019t value you and treat you as nothing"]}
