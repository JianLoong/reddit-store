My friend called me a couple of days later and very kindly said she and her husband would like to pay for a ticket for my mom to come so we could spend the holidays together. \n\nI called my mom who told me her passport was expired and a new one will only be ready by mid January. Oh that kinda sucks I thought but I guess I can wait a bit more. \nBut then she told me that she can only come in February after my sister\u2019s graduation. \n\nAt this point I became so upset. Ive lived here 15 years and not once did anyone bother to come and visit me. Its always my husband and I paying to go and see them at least once a year. \n\nThey\u2019ve always had each other for events like these. My parents were there for my sisters\u2019 marriages, first births, holidays, when they\u2019re ill or going through hard times. I haven\u2019t had that and dealt with every difficult situation with only my husband by my side.\n\nI told her not to bother anymore and cancelled her ticket. Even almost dying is still not enough to get her to leave things for a while and come stay with her eldest daughter for a few weeks.

And without the previous example of mom's immature attitude, the waiting until after graduation if there was no special \"event\" that you were requesting mom's presence for, is also totally reasonable. Both are actually reasonable.\n\nThe context changes knowing that your first request for her to come out during your first birth was rejected, but this could have been decades ago - and people change in that time. \n\nThe implication is a request to come out for the wedding and for the second birth and also for this third birth were also all rejected, but that's only implied and not explicitly stated.  Then of course is the fact that you annually go visit them, presumably on your own dime, and with no reciprocation.  If so, then NTA.

I\u2019ve had family or friends from home visit me a grand total of 3 times in 10 years. And sometimes I get bitter about it.

She's a narcissist like yours. \n\nThe thing I've learned is that you won't get the mothering you need from your not good enough mum. You have to learn to mother yourself.

You can't be mad that your family doesn't want to make that huge trek for weeks at a time just to visit.  Yes it's disappointing, but would you be getting the same attention as your siblings had you not left?\n\nPeople have their own lives and schedules, and it's not always easy to carve out large swaths of time.  As for the expired passport, mine has also expired so I guess that actually happens.\n\nI sympathize that your parents don't visit.  My mother live 8 hours away by car, and she hasn't visited me in 15 years.  I ALWAYS have to go to her.", "INFO: you say your mother has work and studies, can she take the time from work to come?

Your sisters get everything from your parents, so when you parents need something themselves in the future, you parents will be lucky because your sisters can help them carry their burden.
