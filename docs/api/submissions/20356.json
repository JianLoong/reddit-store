Like I will literally move the plate when she reaches out.\n\nShe got upset the first few times but now she orders what she actually wants to eat instead of half her meal consisting of grazing off my meal.\n\nSo absolutely, 100% NTA", "NTA.  I totally agree.  I lost a friend who decided to take one of my THREE chicken fingers without asking.  I was hungry for the rest of the work day.

Everybody wins.", "Definetely NTA, you asked him if he wanted fries before getting your orders, then you bought him some after he started to grab some, he should be happy! For your patience and kindness smh!", "NTA\n\nWhy was he upset? Like seriously\n\nMy partner told me their order the other day of a chicken sandwich, small fry and a oj from a fast food chain. I also got him a chocolate chip Oatmeal cookie bc I was getting one and knew the second he saw mine he'd want one.

Like dude why.", "NTA\n\n#thatAITAfryguy DOESN'T SHARE FOOD.\n\n> telling me he was only taking a few.\n\nAnd that's a *few more* than were available for him to eat.", "NTA. I would have been so appreciative that you went out of your way to get more fries, even though he originally said he didn\u2019t want any.", "NTA. What is he, five years old? He's an adult, he made his decision to not get fries, therefore, he's not entitled to have any of yours and then pout when you get him his own (brilliant move, by the way). Tell him to grow up.", "NTA. When you guys aren't doing food stuff, it might help to sit him down and talk to him. \"You might think it's cute, but it's not. I get the amount of food I want to eat that I'm hungry for. You dig into that when you insist on not getting something for yourself. If you actually only took one or two bites or fries, I wouldn't care. This wouldn't be an issue. But you don't and you seem to be oblivious to that. So from now on, if I'm getting food and you get nothing because 'you're not hungry', then don't reach for my food. If you want just a little, then either ask me to order a larger portion for myself so you can pick at it, or get something small. I don't know why you're getting mad at me about this because I'm setting a pretty ordinary boundary. Don't pick off my plate. I don't like it.\"", "Honestly, the way you wrote this, I can feel the frustration rolling off it.

I vote NTA for buying him his own fries, and for telling him exactly why. The silent treatment after was probably not the best follow-up, but again, I get it and don't really blame you if it's been an ongoing issue. But I'm not sure he's entirely TA either. Food is a complicated subject for many people, and it sounds like you both need to sit down and have a calm, honest discussion about the whole thing.

Get your grubby mitts off my food though.\n\nI find it infuriating. \n\nPlus I\u2019m a leftovers person. If I\u2019ve ordered more food than I\u2019ll eat I will take the rest home and eat it later. I bought the amount of food I wanted. If I offer to share, I mean it. If I don\u2019t offer, I will probably say no to anyone except my kid.\n\nBoundaries need to be respected. Please keep yours. He needs to grow up.", "NTA. I usually share my fries with my husband because I am not a big fry person. BUT, about 2x a year I order my own fry specifically because I want fries and he knows that when I make that special declaration, he is not to touch those fries until I say so or he will regret it. That said, we have a very clear communication about that. If it's one of the rare times I don't want to share, I tell him upfront so that he knows that glares will be delivered, pissiness will ensue and he will be in trouble if he dares to try to eat even 1 fry before I have declared them as available (he can eat a whole large fry in the time it takes me to eat 10 so yeah, sharing means I basically get maybe 10, sometimes less...)\n\nIf you routinely share the fries, you may need to declare upfront that 0 fries will be shared this time, lol. I think buying him his own fry was perfectly acceptable when you realized he was going to eat too many of yours.", "NTA. But maybe you should talk to your husband about this further. There could be something going on with either disordered eating or body image stuff. \n\nMy sister used to order things like salads but would then eat a bunch of her husbands fries or steak for the longest time and she recently confessed that she was having issues with an eating disorder. She felt better ordering salad and eating his food because she was applying morals to food. She has since stopped and just gets what she actually wants. \n\nIdk. It might be jumping the gun but men can have issues with eating disorders too! Wouldn\u2019t hurt to check in on him is all I\u2019m saying.", "So may be unpopular answer but NTA. This probably isn't the first as stated by the way you wrote this. If he's gonna eat maybe 3-5 fries, annoying but ok. Eating half your plate is just rude. I wouldn't talk either after he probably got passive aggressive with you ordering him a fry.", "Nta - if he wanted fries, he should have ordered his own. Not sure if this is some sort of food issue for him or just he\u2019s clueless, I can\u2019t say. But you did nothing wrong.", "NTA", "NTA. Who the heck gets upset over extra fries?! Sheesh.", "NTA. I can\u2019t stand people who do this. If you want something, fucking order it. I am not giving you permission to take mine and in fact due to some traumas when I was much younger surrounding not having enough food, this actually puts me into a rage filled tailspin.", "NTA for buying him fries (the answer to your question). E S H for giving him the silent treatment instead of just finishing the argument.", "NTA. And this could be one of those weird fetishes that both men and women get-you know the type-they want to eat what's on your plate just coz it's on your plate or you touched it or whatever. My suggestion is to just keep buying him his own fries instead of you getting stressed all the time. Buy him his own fries but before you give it to him, show him that you ate 1 fry from that container. Then he'll feel he is eating fries from your plate.", "NTA. I might be biased because this is a personal pet peeve. I fkn hate when people touch the food on my plate and just help themself.", "NTA! I'm the same way and my wife thinks I'm crazy.", "NTA. Taking your fries after saying they didn't want any is just rude. I used to be firmly in the camp of don't you dare touch my food, but I've since added my husband as an exception to that rule. Dude rarely finishes his plate (he just doesn't eat much), so I get whatever he doesn't finish. Since I get about 1.5 meals whenever we go out, dude can have whatever he wants off my plate. lol.", "Joey doesn't share food! \n\nNTA \ud83e\udd23", "This is why I'm single. I get all the fries I want.", "NTA eating off my plate when I haven\u2019t offered is my biggest fucking pet peeve in life like it actually makes me see red.

I love my husband to the moon and back but he\u2019s one of those people lol.

But the partner is a long-time food thief and it clearly annoys OP each time he does this so I understand.", "My friend who does this does it so she is ordering less food thus seeming weight conscious", "Yeah exactly lol, like at this point you know you want fries when you order things so why the whole \u201csong and dance\u201d about not wanting fries?", "... are you okay?\n\n\nYou high horse against younger people is unhealthy but pretty common but the rest is more terrifying  \n\n\nI'm german and seperate finances is pretty common and has been around longer as in for example the us. Our men internationally get called cheap often. But reading a cute story and going on a rant how other people will be confused (the irony) and go on to tell a tale about evil women intentionally manipulating their partners out of 10$ a month is... something.", "I\u2019m in therapy thank you very much and have made progress but regardless of MY issues, no one has a right to take MY food.", "i understand that. it doesn\u2019t hurt to ask if he wanted his own after the fact of taking some of her own. \n\nbut all in all this is petty to me. are you that upset over sharing a large fry with your husband? you wont die from not getting 100% of a large fry. \n\nbut in that case if he said he didn\u2019t want one and she doesn\u2019t want to share. there are other ways to go about communicating that other than being rude.", "The Iranian french fries are not the issue here?", "[deleted]", "the entitlement is astonishing lol", "My ex would say he didn\u2019t want anything when I was cooking. I would cook what I wanted and then he would have \u201cjust a taste\u201d taking about 1/4 of the food. I started asking are you sure - I will be cooking the exact amount I want to eat. I\u2019m happy to do a bit extra if you want some.", "Whereas, I am the opposite- I\u2019m the \u201ccannot eat the whole meal so always gives her husband the leftovers\u201d type.

It\u2019s because she asked him not to touch her food, and he did it anyway.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about food, it\u2019s about respect and boundaries.", "Both are male", "I had a friend who started pushing boundaries, just small things that didn't bother me too much. One time he came over, I was making myself nachos. I asked him if he wanted nachos, he said no. Then he ate over half my nachos, which was my dinner. \n\nWe are not friends any more. Literally that was the last time we hung out.", "she hasnt specified that but seeing that she\u2019s married her husband should know that about her. if not then she needs to communicate that as i said or he needs to learn how to respect that", "\u201cActually it\u2019s about ethics in food ordering\u201d give your head a shake", "She has specified, as she said she knows from past experience that he'll clear her plate"]}
