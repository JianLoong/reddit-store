Like dude why.", "NTA\n\n#thatAITAfryguy DOESN'T SHARE FOOD.\n\n> telling me he was only taking a few.\n\nAnd that's a *few more* than were available for him to eat.", "NTA. I would have been so appreciative that you went out of your way to get more fries, even though he originally said he didn\u2019t want any.", "NTA. What is he, five years old? He's an adult, he made his decision to not get fries, therefore, he's not entitled to have any of yours and then pout when you get him his own (brilliant move, by the way). Tell him to grow up.", "NTA. When you guys aren't doing food stuff, it might help to sit him down and talk to him. \"You might think it's cute, but it's not. I get the amount of food I want to eat that I'm hungry for. You dig into that when you insist on not getting something for yourself. If you actually only took one or two bites or fries, I wouldn't care. This wouldn't be an issue. But you don't and you seem to be oblivious to that. So from now on, if I'm getting food and you get nothing because 'you're not hungry', then don't reach for my food. If you want just a little, then either ask me to order a larger portion for myself so you can pick at it, or get something small. I don't know why you're getting mad at me about this because I'm setting a pretty ordinary boundary. Don't pick off my plate. I don't like it.\"", "Honestly, the way you wrote this, I can feel the frustration rolling off it.

The silent treatment after was probably not the best follow-up, but again, I get it and don't really blame you if it's been an ongoing issue. But I'm not sure he's entirely TA either. Food is a complicated subject for many people, and it sounds like you both need to sit down and have a calm, honest discussion about the whole thing.

BUT, about 2x a year I order my own fry specifically because I want fries and he knows that when I make that special declaration, he is not to touch those fries until I say so or he will regret it. That said, we have a very clear communication about that. If it's one of the rare times I don't want to share, I tell him upfront so that he knows that glares will be delivered, pissiness will ensue and he will be in trouble if he dares to try to eat even 1 fry before I have declared them as available (he can eat a whole large fry in the time it takes me to eat 10 so yeah, sharing means I basically get maybe 10, sometimes less...)\n\nIf you routinely share the fries, you may need to declare upfront that 0 fries will be shared this time, lol. I think buying him his own fry was perfectly acceptable when you realized he was going to eat too many of yours.", "NTA. But maybe you should talk to your husband about this further. There could be something going on with either disordered eating or body image stuff. \n\nMy sister used to order things like salads but would then eat a bunch of her husbands fries or steak for the longest time and she recently confessed that she was having issues with an eating disorder. She felt better ordering salad and eating his food because she was applying morals to food. She has since stopped and just gets what she actually wants. \n\nIdk. It might be jumping the gun but men can have issues with eating disorders too! Wouldn\u2019t hurt to check in on him is all I\u2019m saying.", "So may be unpopular answer but NTA. This probably isn't the first as stated by the way you wrote this. If he's gonna eat maybe 3-5 fries, annoying but ok. Eating half your plate is just rude.

E S H for giving him the silent treatment instead of just finishing the argument.", "NTA. And this could be one of those weird fetishes that both men and women get-you know the type-they want to eat what's on your plate just coz it's on your plate or you touched it or whatever. My suggestion is to just keep buying him his own fries instead of you getting stressed all the time. Buy him his own fries but before you give it to him, show him that you ate 1 fry from that container. Then he'll feel he is eating fries from your plate.", "NTA. I might be biased because this is a personal pet peeve. I fkn hate when people touch the food on my plate and just help themself.", "NTA! I'm the same way and my wife thinks I'm crazy.", "NTA. Taking your fries after saying they didn't want any is just rude. I used to be firmly in the camp of don't you dare touch my food, but I've since added my husband as an exception to that rule.

My dad not being his dad and being horribly abusive to our mom, he didn't want to have to be in any way kind to my dad, but wanted to help take care of us (his sisters) so he'd put up with my dad showing up almost every weekend to feed us sort of out of brotherhood/obligation if that makes any sense at all.", "> You might be thinking - why didn\u2019t you split it into two bowls \n\ni\u2019m over here think who the hell eats french fries out of a bowl lol", "Interesting. My neighbor asked me to buy him a pack of smokes. I said I had too little money. So then I felt bad and I think I found like an old pack with a few and I told the staff where I live if they could give it to him. They said he quit smoking. I was so confused.", "Cigarettes drive people loco just like any other addiction", "Does he (literally) live in a van - sometimes by a river - and have no teeth left from years of meth use? Purple stripe in his hair? If so, tell that crazy fucker hi for me.", "Mustard yellow 70\u2019s Ford truck with a rusted chain substituting as a tailgate and opens only on the driver\u2019s side. Lives in a trailer with last year\u2019s Christmas tree lurking in the corner. Several cats. Has just enough hair for a rockin combover. Doesn\u2019t smoke crack anymore, smokes those non filtered cigs back to back. God love him, he tries.", "This has always irked me ever since I was a kid. Adults would ask for \"a taste\" of my food or a \"sip\" of my drink, and would take half, if not all. It made me grow up not willing to share food with anyone unless I trusted them 100%.\n\nWhen it comes to my husband, if I don't want a full portion, I'll ask him if he wants to share. If he says no, I get my own. Or if I wanted a few fries, I ask beforehand. And I literally take no more than 4 fries (or 2 sips of his drink) and then don't ask again.", "Yeah.  She doesn't do it much any more.  Early on I asked my husband about it and he just kind of shrugged.  I guess she had always done it and it was normal to them. \n\nSome time later, when we were over and ordering food, I insisted that my husband order a side for her (and one time a meal)  I think she started getting the hint when food just appeared for her.  She still kind of does it but not every meal.   My big thing is that she could ask instead of walking and just grabbing like a feral child. The second part of it is that I HATE being stood over, it makes me nervous. \n\n(And the sharing fries makes sense when your kids aren't going to eat them all.  Yesterday, I threw away four almost full sides of fries when we went out for lunch but even when we share sides, we put them on a plate in the middle of the table and pass them when needed.)\n\nEdit wrong word", "Very impressive communication.", "I would have bought a lot of high calory snacks and left them on display so she would keep eating them and gain weight.", "Disordered eating is very real and unfortunately it isn't taken as seriously in men as it is in women \ud83d\udc95 I'm just glad my husband and I were able to figure out a message that keeps him happy and still allows me to get cookies lol\n\nBefore we did this, we just wouldn't buy any snacks. Which means anytime I had access to anything sweet I would eat way more than I needed to and feel so gross after. We both have different kinds of disordered eating and have had to really communicate to find something that works for both of us", "The Iranian yogurt post is one of the ones that brings a smile to my face every time. I would find it equally amusing if it were real as I would if were fake, because even if it\u2019s fake I\u2019m glad someone used their creative energy to make such a funny post. And if it\u2019s real- well I love knowing that somewhere out there a man exists that bought 2 extra fridges to feed his Iranian yogurt addiction."]}
