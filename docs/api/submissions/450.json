My partner and I have an eleven month old puppy. He\u2019s very agile and well trained. He goes to doggy daycare and is very friendly with big and small dogs though he regularly prefers playing with bigger dogs because they can match his speed. \n\n\nA couple days ago, we took our puppy to an off leash dog park (he\u2019s a regular at off leash dog parks.) He was running around and chasing a big dog. While chasing the bigger dog, our dog accidentally bumped into an old lady walking with the assistance of a walking stick. She did not fall or wasn\u2019t hurt. \n\nBefore we could say sorry and call our dog back, she started screaming at us at the top of her voice that we should watch where our dog is running and controlling where he goes; that he\u2019s out of control running around like that and bumped into her. \nMy partner told her that well it is a dog park and she cut him off and starting screaming again saying that we shouldn\u2019t tell her not to come here and that we should control where our dog is going. \n\nWe kind of left the issue at that and continued walking and we could hear the lady hurling abuses still. She continued on her walk and we saw her again later. This time our puppy was again chasing another dog and he almost went close to the lady again while running. We called our dog back and as he turned to come back to us and she started screaming again in front of everyone that we should control the dog and that it\u2019s a dog park and a people\u2019s park and people of all abilities should be accommodated in this park. \n\nMy partner and I left the dog park shortly after.

In an off-leash dog area humans are responsible for themselves and hugging the edges if they have mobility or injury concerns. At the parks near us there are even liability disclaimers along those lines at the gates. I\u2019ve been knocked over by dogs when I was in the middle of the park. I was choosing to stand on the race track, so it\u2019s on me.", "NTA. It's an off leash dog park. The old lady shouldn't have been there if she didn't want to be around excitable dogs. \n\nI had a similar instance where a young woman was in the fully fenced off leash dog park, taking photos of trees. All of the dogs in the park (around 8 of them playing together) went over to check her out. None of them jumped up or anything, just sniffing and seeing if she had any treats. And then she started freaking out, telling us to 'control our dogs' and how they should be on leashes and such. \nI did recall my dogs away (as did the other owners) and try and distract them with a ball. And then I told her is was an off leash dog park, so what did she expect. It's clearly signposted, with lots of rules and warnings on display before you can even enter the gates, and again once inside. She continued to rant at us, so we all just ignored her until after she left (through the gate past the signage). \nSome people just don't have brains, or don't use them, and are too wrapped up in their own little world to pay attention to the world around them.", "NTA why is she hobbling around an off leash dog park and getting mad dogs are being dogs lol\n\nHowever I wouldn\u2019t let my dog run off leash if they didn\u2019t have a perfect recall. I\u2019d work with your dog more before being in that situation again for the dogs safety above all else.", "NTA You need to pay attention to what's going on around you when you're at an off leash dog park. Dogs are chasing each other and running at full speed. At the dog park we go to, dogs may swerve to get around you, but not always. I had my leg broken about a year and a half ago at the dog park and I didn't blame the dog. My head's on a swivel now when I'm there.", "NTA. That's just one of the dangers people are supposed to be aware of at dog parks. She needed to take steps to keep herself out of the line of fire so to speak. People who enter need to be on alert for where dogs are running.", "NTA.  It's a space specifically set aside for dogs to run around and play off their leashes. It sounds like she probably needs to be a good deal more aware of her surroundings.", "NTA. Your dog was doing exactly what dogs are fully expected to do at an off leash dog park. If the woman doesn't like it, she should stay out of their (the dogs') park.", "NTA. Usually I don't side with pet owners, but the lady was in an off-leash dog park lol. Pretty clear-cut.", "Seriously? I know she is a old lady but in what alternate reality could you be considered an asshole for trying to apologize politely for something that was absolutely not your fault?\n\nNTA", "Dogs in play aren't easy to control. If you're not an able bodied person or willing to get bumped into, you should probably avoid areas where dogs are running off leash, enjoying dog activities. Hell,  I'm a dog person and still skirt around groups of playing doggos.\n\nDid she expect you to scold your puppy, and for it to understand wtf it was in trouble for?\n\nSome people are idiots, NTA", "NTA. We no longer go to dog parks since we have a fenced-in yard but for a year we lived in an RV and regularly took our dog to off-leash parks as we traveled.\n\nI\u2019ve never seen a park throughout the US that wasn\u2019t fenced with a securely locked gate. They are also usually relatively small,  or wide open spaces like children\u2019s parks, and frankly usually dirt, not grass. \n\nSo for this woman to come in, I feel like she gave up her right to scream at you for your small dog running into her. Now that doesn\u2019t mean a dog owner isn\u2019t still supposed to be in control of their dog, but frail non-owners should be prepared for off leash dogs running around. Just saying\u2026.", "NTA. You had control of your dog, there was a minor accident, it happens.

It hurt like hell but I didn\u2019t yell at the dog or owner.

That old lady was just an entitled nut job.", "NTA. Take a picture of the part of the sign that says 'off leash allowed' or whatever the verbiage is. Go over to her and point it out. Tell her that she takes her own risks when coming into an off leash allowed park at that point and if she wants to be around controlled pets, she needs to stay in leashed areas or get a robotic dog that you need a remote control for. Point out that if she were to fall/get hurt, it would be a shame, but she's effectively signing away her liability by putting herself in harm's way and if she's aiming for a lawsuit, she's going to waste money on a whole lot of nothing.\n\nThen continue your day in your legally allowed area to have your dog off leash.\n\nI say this as someone that does not like off leash dogs because I'm a bit afraid of dogs. So guess what I don't do? I don't go into dog parks with off leash allowed. Wow. It's almost like I'm an adult, capable of making adult situations about what I want and don't want to deal with. \n\nAlso inform her that if she keeps it up, you're going to record her interactions with you and your dog and her being in the park so that you have backup for harassment. \n\nIt's like going to a playground with playground equipment and slides and swings and then getting mad that there's kids there.", "Yes and no i understand hes a puppy, but not everyone likes dogs or wants to interact with them, you really should have good recall of your dog before going to off leash parks, its for everyone\u2019s benefit", "I don't have a dog and I don't hang out in dog parks. So my opinion might not be valid. If I'm wrong, I'm sure the masses will let me know. \n\nSo, yes, it is a dog park where dogs are allowed to run around off-leash, but does that mean they can just run into people? Your dog didn't hurt her and didn't cause an accident, but according to your post, he did bump into her. \n\nChildren are allowed to run around at a children park, but I wouldn't let my kid run *into* a person (with or without a cane). That's just not appropriate. \n\nI suspect this lady was okay with the notion of dogs playing fetch on the grass or running with their people, but not with a dog running into her. That *could* hurt her and she does have mobility problems so she is probably extra anxious about falling. \n\nI do petsit and walk my neighbor's dog for her sometimes, and I have never let the dog run into people or jump on them (if in can stop it). These just do not seem like appropriate behaviors to me. \n\nSo, I think you were a little bit YTA for letting your dog bump into a disabled lady. \n\nNow, I think that lady was a mega asshole for yelling about it. I can understand her coming to the park without a dog--maybe she thinks of it as a park at which dogs are allowed to be off-leash, rather than a park that caters exclusively to dogs--but yelling at people like that is very rude.", "YTA.  You are not being honest about the park at all and you thought people wouldn\u2019t notice when you slipped in the last sentence of the woman yelling at you.  It\u2019s a PARK.  Parks aren\u2019t made solely for DOGS. If an old lady was there with a walking stick without a dog it\u2019s definitely not only for dogs.  And your partner said she cut the dog off??? LOL.  The dog is the one running fast, how could she cut him off?\n\nEverything about this post honestly screams narcissist to me.  Your dog is a puppy, but according to YOU, it\u2019s:\n-agile and well trained\n-very friendly with all dog sizes\n-prefers big dogs because they can match his speed (question, can your dog outrun usain bolt? Inquiring minds want to know)", "Absolutely true. I have seen idiots bring toddlers into off B leash parks (not in strollers) and get upset if running dogs come too close to them. I have Al  as I seen idiots come into the parks with their fast food and wonder why dogs are interested.", "OP stated that the dog returned upon being  called the 2nd time the cranky old woman wandered through the OFF LEASH PARK.

That's the whole point.", "Ah, \u201cdogs are being dogs\u201d\u2026 the excuse for every single dog attack and shitty dog behavior that\u2019s ever happened.

However, dogs do run a lot faster than little kids. I did mention in one my comments that the lady was aware of the dogs running and kept walking in their way. I\u2019m a regular in dog parks and have had dogs run into us, bump into us and we understand that that\u2019s what dogs do. Under reasonable circumstances, we do make sure our dog is not in people\u2019s way (asking him to \u201cwait\u201d if people are in front of him, \u201cstop\u201d if he\u2019s too close etc) \nI wanted to apologize to the lady right away but any conversation that contains abuses and yelling in public is not a civil conversation so we didn\u2019t engage her once she kept going off.

It's rough out there.", "Well it\u2019s probably a park with dogs allowed off leash, if its not fenced off then its public property, so the old lady can walk through there and expect not to get bumped into by a puppy, and plus you just never know with people she might be frightened of dogs or had a bad experience from dogs, so a responsible dog owner would have better recall on their dog before going to a offleash area to avoid issues of any kind", "Are you going to respond to any of the other points I made, such as your partner yelling at her that *she* got in a dog\u2019s way?
