In my early 20's I drank alot. And I mean ALOT. Slowed down in my 30's and in the past 5 or 6 years I've tapered off slowly but still it's been a weekly vice with some exceptions. After talking through alot of this with one of my closest friends, we agreed to just go completely sober (for the same reasons lol). This was last summer.\n\nFast forward to this past December and I told me wife that I would be giving up the booze for advent so if we got invited to a christmas party it would be an easy out. Christmas came and went and then I took my kids on a road trip to visit some family friends. When I got back, I was sitting at dinner one night and was just super tired and the kids were being rowdy and I was just really over it all. Wife says maybe I should have a drink. I laugh and say something jokingly like, \"I know, right?\" So she goes to grab a couple bottles and then sets them down in front of me, and asks which one I want. I say that I have things to do, so not now, but maybe later.\n\nNew years day came up and then another buddy of mine suggested that a whole group of us guys should do a dry January. Naturally, I thought it would be good to join them. So I mentioned to my wife that I would be jumping on the dry January train with some guys and she got all weird and started asking what games I was playing. I told her I wasn't playing any games.\n\nShe says, \"Yeah you are. Your not doing a dry January. That's what you do when your giving something up, but your not giving anything up because you dont even drink.\" I said that clearly, I like to drink alot and anybody who knows me knows that. Then she says, \"Yeah well you didn't drink on Christmas.\" I was like, yeah, I couldn't because I had to drive the kids out of state. \"You could of drank on the trip.\" No, I was staying at a hotel and had to drive the little boys back each night. \"If you wanted to drink you could have had a drink new years eve but you didn't.\"\n\nAt this point, I'm like I don't know why your even angry about this and she says, \"I've known something this whole time. It doesnt add up. I offered you a drink the other night and you didn't take it.\" I told her I had work to do and she immediately fires back that I don't work in the evening any more (which is true). She finally just says, \"You LIED to me, its dishonest and a stupid mind game that youre playing.\"\n\nI dont feel like I lied to her. I wasn't trying to pull a fast one on her. She's just heard me promise a hundred times before that I would manage my drinking and after lots of promises and no action, I decided just do it and dont bother telling anybody.

It's great you chose to quit, but if I was in your wife's position, I might feel like you didn't trust me enough to at least say something like \"I haven't drank in x weeks, I'm going to try and keep it going for now.\" (Not saying she doesn't feel like you trust her, just that I think that's how I would maybe feel in her shoes)", "I would look into why you didn't feel comfortable telling her. Are you trying to avoid a more intimate relationship and sharing about yourself. Did you think she would be against you quitting. Sometimes when we get healthy the people around us act out because it changes the dynamic. \n\nYou went through a radical change and it was a healthy one so that's amazing. But for some reason the number one supporter in your life, or who is supposed to be your number one supporter, you didn't feel a need to share or talk to them about it. Why do you keep them at a distance. Maybe it's your fault, maybe it's not", "The reason i'm saying YTA is because if this is an argument it seems like your wife is at her wits end other wise why be so demanding rather or not you have drank?", "A lie by omission is still a lie. I can't fathom why you wouldn't tell your spouse, of all people, that you decided to quit drinking. Especially when she directly confronted you about it. She's not mad that you quit drinking, she's mad that you're lying to her and keeping things from her. This is clearly important to you and if you're lying to her about this important thing, what other important things might you be lying about?", "NTA. I saw your reasoning for not telling her in the comments, and I get it.\n\nIf it helps, research has found that telling people that you're making a major life change can actually sabotage your efforts. There\u2019s a thing called the intention-behavior gap, and publicizing intentions can compromise the drive to follow through. Part of this is because you get the same mental reward for talking about doing a thing as you do from doing it.\n\nI've dealt with substance abuse, too. In my situation, it was best that I didn't tell anyone. What actually worked was quietly cutting out the people, places, and situations that facilitated it in the first place. This obviously isn't a thing that will work for everyone, but I'm mentioning it to point out that you definitely *can* succeed at this kind of goal without announcing it.", "YTA\n\nMan, you *started out* just fine.\n\n> I told me wife that I would be giving up the booze for advent so if we got invited to a christmas party it would be an easy out.\n\n... why?

I totally understand why your wife would be pissed that you didn't think you could have her as you confident, and that you didn't want/need her help. It's a life partner's job and duty to support their SO, and you basically just show her she was useless at her job. \n\nYou had your reason I guess, but I understand you wife for feeling \"not good enough\" because you didn't even need her help or think she would be important enough in your life to be put in the loop.", "I would say NTA, but I\u2019m not 100% with you. If you truly want to quit drinking or at the very least turn it into an occasional thing, then you need to make anyone in your life who drinks with you or is with you when drinking aware of what you\u2019re trying. Your wife\u2019s reaction rubs me the wrong way, but she\u2019s not entirely in the wrong either. You should\u2019ve told her point blank \u201chey, I\u2019m trying very hard to cut back on my drinking, so can you help me with that and support me?\u201d That\u2019s all you had to say. You can\u2019t exactly blame her for feeling like you kept it from her cause from the sound of it you never told her an outright no, you kept saying maybe later.

I think, once everything is cooled down, you should sit her down, and tell her that.  One less broken promise.  Look, I know sobriety isn't easy, but take it one day at a time, and keep up the good work.  Take it one day at a time because some will be harder than others.  If you keep to not drinking, a year from now you'll find you feel a hell of a lot better mentally, physically, and emotionally.  Your family will also be happier.\n\nFor now give your wife time to cool down.  YTA, but you're NTA at the same time.  Are because you didn't make sure she knew you were serious.  NTA because you are finally keeping a promise to her, even if she didn't realize it.\n\nGood luck.  I'm not a drinker, never have been, but my mom was.  You ever wanna a clear picture of what alcohol does to a person, and their loved ones DM me, and I'll tell you.", "So I get that the whole accountability circle isn\u2019t always helpful and you didn\u2019t want to drag your wife into a situation where you could create disappointment. Understood.\n\nBut as the daughter of someone who has recently gotten sober, withholding information about this 1. Can seed doubt about what is happening, why things are happening, did something occur to prompt the change, is everything OK health wise, etc. and 2. Make your loved ones worry that something that they do inherently triggers or has triggered strife in your not drinking. \n\nLike you\u2019re not the asshole for not coming out forthrightly, but when asked about it, having a \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to work on my relationship with alcohol; haven\u2019t drank since thanksgiving and hoping to keep it up\u201d discussion is helpful in at least trying to soothe those anxieties as they may bubble up. Transparency is good when dealing with loved ones who care about you and your well being, and generally loved ones of people with substance issues generally want to create environments to help someone feel more secure and surefooted.", "The question I have is WHY haven't you been honest with her? Is is because you don't feel like she'd be supportive of your sobriety (which is possible since she apparently was deliberately pushing alcohol at you to see what would happen).\n\nAnyway, CONGRATULATIONS on your sobriety!\n\nNow go do something about whatever messed up dynamic you have going on with your wife.  \n\n\nETA: Read comments and I get it now. Super happy for you and I expect once you explain it this way, your wife will be too.", "YTA you say you dont FEEL like you lied but you literally did though? \n\nSo MONTHS ago you decided to go completed sober and didnt tell your wife. I mean, okay, not the kind of marriage I would want but it doesnt make you an AH. \n\nBut then you started making up excuses for why you werent drinking. Thats what makes it super weird. And then when she clocked on you were making excuses you doubled down entirely and are making out like **she's** being ridiculous for noticing the complete *lies*. \n\nIf you were just trying not to make a big deal of it in case you start again you could just say \"Oh I just feel like being sober at the moment\". No big commitment, nor a lie, but an honest take about where your at. Instead you've just been weird about the whole thing and told outright lies about working, and needing an excuse for parties and all the rest...", "~~INFO~~ did you not tell her because you were afraid you\u2019d start drinking again and it\u2019ll be all for nothing (you didn\u2019t trust yourself)? Or you didn\u2019t tell her because you think she\u2019ll sabotage your effort?\n\n\nETA: NTA. OP, you\u2019re doing something great, at your own pace. If what works for you is keeping it to yourself for the time being, so be it. It wasn\u2019t a lie. It was a private effort.", "I don't know that I'd go all the way to YTA, but you really should have just told her and I honestly have to wonder if there's some deeper reason why you didn't. If there is a reason, that's fine, but it's something you need to confront head-on and work through. \n\nYou did essentially lie by omission and I could see why some would see that as a type of mind game.", "Congratulations on making the decision to not drink anymore and for every day that you have resisted.  NTA for not telling her\u2026but why are you still not saying anything?  Do you think she will\u2026?  What?  There is a reason and you don\u2019t have to tell us, but why don\u2019t you co fire in your partner?", "Why\u2019d she so mad you don\u2019t want to drink? How much does she drink??", "Info: does your wife drink a lot, and might she think that you view her as a bad influence there?", "I have some questions. Before deciding to get sober, was your wife and you similar in your drinking habits? In other words, were you her drinking buddy and maybe she misses that relationship with you? Do you consider yourself an alcoholic and have you gone to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings? \n\nNow I have a suggestion, if you ever blacked out while drinking, have ever felt you couldn\u2019t stop drinking, or periodically binge drink, you might want to try going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and see what they offer. The general suggestion for people who start going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings is to do 90 meetings in 90 days and get a sponsor - someone in AA with long term sobriety who you can discuss issues such as you\u2019ve described. These would include your past drinking, why you\u2019ve decided to stop drinking, how to stay sober, and generally be a supportive person.\n\nIf you are concerned about someone else\u2019s drinking, you could also look into Al Anon, a support group for friends and family members of alcoholics and addicts. But, from what you\u2019ve written, my suggestion is to try going to AA and see what it has to offer you.\n\nYou are definitely NTA for trying to be sober and I think it is wise to first become better informed, and get support, before having a conversation with your wife.", "You did lie and for what? If you want to quit drinking that's great but I have no idea what you're doing keeping it from your partner and why you can't just say you've stopped drinking. That's a big thing to omit especially if your relationship with her has been effected by your drinking habits. What do expect to gain? Yta for playing games.", "YTA you had ample opportunities to tell her the truth. But you didn't. You were already dry in December so you can't do a Dry January. Now your wife is going to think about what else your keeping from her.", "In your effort not to be untrustworthy you quadrupled down on lying to your wife.

However, YTA for not just telling your wife, \"hey, I gave up drinking for good\". Why the constant excuses when all that could be avoided by this one comment?", "YTA, you are lying to your wife. Just tell her the truth. Giving up booze isn't some terrible thing", "Of COURSE YTA. It's a significant change, and one you've talked about.\nAnd it sounds like she already knows, given that she hasn't seen you drink in weeks, and said so.", "lol @ all the Y/T/A votes \n\nNTA at all OP and congrats on making a good choice! No clue why your wife is so pissed lol maybe she needs to evaluate how much she drinks", "YTA what game are you trying to play here, of course you need to tell your SO you\u2019ve decided to quit something you regularly do. Why were you hiding this from her OP", "NTA, she is. You\u2019re making an extremely healthy decision and it seems like you were very transparent with her beforehand that you were going to change your habits. She\u2019s being unnecessarily manipulative here and should not be pressuring you into something you want to do", "NTA but your wife is being super weird. Is it a case of her needing to drink and having you as a support for this? Stick with it though, you are doing the right thing, well done.", "NTA.  Sometimes doing it alone is the only way.  \n\nWith that said, she\u2019s upset because she feels like you pushed her out of a major event in your life.  As your partner, life events are expected to be shared.  It builds intimacy.  I\u2019m sure that wasn\u2019t your intention, but she may need to hear that.  Time for a serious chat.", "Honestly I\u2019m going to go with NTA, only because you deciding to quit drinking & staying true to your word before telling her was good. Sometimes when we want to do something & we tell someone they give us the dopamine rush without us doing anything. \n\nHowever, I do feel as if you should have told her in January that you have quit drinking & the one month was a way to solidify the decision.", "NTA. Why wouldn't she just be like. Hey you haven't had a drink in a while good for you! And then leave it?  Makes no sense. If alcohol was a problem and you promised to give it up and didn't in the past it makes complete sense why you wouldn't say anything now.", "Nope, and hang in there, you won't regret it. Alcohol is poison.", "NTA why the hell is she angry at you for staying sober? You don't have to drink every month to still be a drinker. You would have to be dry for about a year to be a garenteed non drinker. Shesoundsd like she's judging you because she has a problem. You don't have to tell her that at all, and choosing not to drink for a month or two and being a non drinker are two different things unless you declare you are now a non drinker.\n\n\nNo wonder you didn't say anything. it sounds like she would have pressured you into drinking. I didn't tell anyone when I quit smoking, quitting something is easier when other people don't have expectations of you. That said, when you quit alcohol you usually have to quit alcoholic mates and even sometimes bad relationships. Good luck.", "NTA but it kinda feels like there is a reason behind you not telling her and if I had to guess it's linked to her weird and overblown reaction to you not drinking lately and wanting to have a dry January when she should be happy and proud that you haven't been drinking.", "NTA.\n\nI'm genuinely dumbfounded. Unless there's more as to why you didn't tell her outside of your explanation which I totally think is fine as is, she's completely and utterly in the wrong. Usually news like this is met with a \"congrats, so proud you're doing this\".\n\n\"You lied\"? Lied about what exactly? Has she not noticed you've not been drinking since the summer? Would have thought that would have been a **VERY** obvious change. I feel like if she was the husband, people would be giving her shit for not noticing and being an attentive husband or how she clearly doesn't care enough about you.\n\nBut seriously how do you not notice your borderline alcoholic partner going from drinking every week, to not drinking for months straight?", "NTA though there\u2019s a reason you weren\u2019t more up front with her, and her oversized and weirdly negative response to your not drinking probably has something to do with it.", "NTA.

No need to make it wierd, even if you feel slight embarrassment.", "NAH\n\nI can see from your responses that jumping into saying you've stopped drinking is a big step for you, and having these little steps to get you along is working well. However I can also see that when confronted you didn't response clearly and honestly and it makes sense your wife would be angry about that. \n\nI think that many people use quite black and white thinking which makes it seem like you have to be one thing or another. \n\nYou can be trying not to drink and still be drinking. \n\nYou can be trying not to drink and not be drinking. \n\nYou can be not drinking for a month and still trying to do a dry period. \n\nIt doesn't have to be one way or another but i think you need to explain it clearly to important people in your life rather than dodging it. \n\nIt sounds to me a bit like \"I haven't been drinking for a few months and I'm still trying not drink\".

My husband started working out last year without some big annoucement and I was happy for him (and for me!) when I realized what he was doing because it meant he was going to be healthier and hotter, ngl. \n\nYou quitting drinking when you're a problem drinker not only means you'll be healthier in the long run, but you'll also spend less money on alcohol, both of which benefit both you and your wife.\n\nI'm guessing she's feeling insecure because your marriage has a deeply-rooted, unhealthy pattern in which you're the drinker and she's the enabler.  The enabler likes that role because they're with someone who won't leave because they can't function on their own.You getting out of that pattern makes her feel like you might grow past her and this relationship.\n\nYou'd probably both benefit from counseling and/or AA and Al-anon to figure out how to relate in healthy ways moving forward.", "Info: if your wife wants you to quit drinking, why keep plying you with alcohol?", "I get OP.

It\u2019d be different if your drinking problems weren\u2019t the reason you were abstaining but you are saying it is. \n\nIt just also lined up with the answers you gave as those were some of the expressions of the abstaining though not exactly the reason you were abstaining?\n\nAll the reasons you gave her (driving, etc.) are definitely good reasons not to drink and I\u2019m sure are still true but it\u2019s not why you started with this specific dry period per se and I think that\u2019s where she\u2019s coming from.", "She's not mad about me not drinking....she's mad that I lied to her.", "Wife barely drinks.

And congratulations, btw. You're doing a good thing, and you seem to be sticking to it.

And get clear on your feelings about it.

Don't do the 'oh well I lapsed this weekend so I may as well give up on giving up' thing.\n\nIn my experience, there can also be a fear of committing to totally quitting that puts you off, so you just keep telling yourself 'just for this month' and then next month 'just another month'.

Whatever his reasons, he shouldn\u2019t have been that evasive with his partner.", "Or he\u2019s playing games, just like his wife said. OP might be a dry drunk still stuck in the habits of drinking, but instead of being less-than-honest with his wife about how much he\u2019s drinking, he\u2019s lying about not drinking at all. \n\nWaiting for her to notice, telling her he\u2019s not drinking because he has to work when he wasn\u2019t working.

What you\u2019re doing is commendable.", "Sure, but that's still generally not a healthy dynamic and building an accountability circle is a good thing for those struggling with addiction provided they do so with people equipped and willing to be part of that.\n\nIn short, while that might be an understandable thing for OP to do, I would still suggest it's something he should probably take a closer look at.", "Just want to add I think you are coming from a good place and intentions, OP. I have issues with drinking. I was tired of making declarations of how I was going to do better to my loved ones, then failing and feeling I was just a disappointment.\n\nYou weren\u2019t trying to lie is how I\u2019m seeing this, but save everyone from disappointment while also doing the real work.\n\nAnd also proving to yourself you wanted to do this and aren\u2019t just performing to keep your word but actually really meaning it.\n\nI think you should just express this if that\u2019s the case.\n\nI think people who don\u2019t have issues with alcohol or substances might not understand how hard it hits you to want to do better but be failing and if we do it without declarations it\u2019s a bit less scary.\n\nWe look like bad people when we say we want to be better with alcohol and then can\u2019t do it. And they just don\u2019t understand it because they aren\u2019t an addict/have some issues. We want to mean it.\n\nAnd when you fail over and over it builds the reputation of being an alcoholic who didn\u2019t mean what they said and they just want the kudos and pretend they were going to do the work and don\u2019t do any.\n\nBut that\u2019s not how it is. You could go weeks without a drink after such a declaration and slip up still.\n\nHumans view time linearly. We'd like to have the idea or desire, and then make it happen, and have no scrambling around. A to B feels more comfortable than A to C to E to B back to A when we are trying to get somewhere.\n\nUnfortunately, most progress is not linear. I'm not sure any is. You could work out at the gym and be making amazing linear seeming progress than get injured and have to start all over with a set back.\n\nThere will be bad days and good days and the people we make the promises to stop drinking to don't always understand when a failure comes up because to them if there was a chance for failure still, we would not have said we were going to succeed and change yet. And they don't get to see us everyday and see those bad days. They have a limited picture compared to the one going through it. But people who struggle with alcohol often want to change before it fully really happens. That's why it succeeds - the person really did want to change and that want has to come before the change. But it's a messy way there sometimes even still.\n\nI also don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any truth to this but I\u2019ve heard it\u2019s also better to not talk about your goals till you complete them because it rewards your brain and some people get enough good feelings from saying what they will do, that they never actually follow through.\n\nMaybe you can assure her you would have eventually opened up about this and were still just trying to do the real work?", "This is an excellent summary of what went wrong, thanks. I really wanted to make it to a year (or a long time) without telling her so that it could be \"my little victory\" but clearly that was selfish and short-sighted.", "Yeah but you didn\u2019t.  You just didn\u2019t drink right? Those aren\u2019t the same thing", "And do you understand why that would make her very sad, and very hurt..?\n\nIt might have come out as anger, but underlying that is just sad. And hurt. \n\nYou have hurt her really badly by not trusting her with this - *and I understand why you did it*. \n\nIt makes sense that you didn\u2019t trust yourself and so you started out doing this in secret. I totally get that. \n\nBut it\u2019s gone on for ages now and your wife is aware that you excluded her and it makes her so very, very sad that you are still lying to her now. \n\nDo you want her to feel hurt & sad & excluded? I\u2019m guessing not. It sounds like you quite like each other, most of the time?\n\nI get that giving up alcohol was initially all about you & your needs. That\u2019s ok. That\u2019s the way it needed to be. \n\nBut you\u2019re past that now. It\u2019s time to explain, and to include her, and to make sure she knows that you starting off in secret had *nothing to do with her and everything to do with you*. \n\nBecause right now she doesn\u2019t believe that. Because of how you\u2019ve kept the lie going for too long. \n\nGo right now & tell her this. Do not wait until she forces a \u201cserious conversation\u201d on you. Be an adult & take responsibility for resolving this. If necessary show her this post.\n\nETA: and it\u2019s ok that as part of the resolution, you ask her to continue the pretence that it\u2019s not really happening. Because I know my crazy brain likes to rebel against most things. Including / especially my own brain. So if I have any kind of \u201crule\u201d in place then it\u2019s more likely to screw me up than if I kinda ignore what I\u2019m doing with 99% of my brain. If you need her to be really proud of you but still not put much focus on you not drinking then you can ask her for that kind of support. If you need her to continue the pretence outside of the 2 of you that you are just \u201ctemporarily not drinking\u201d then I\u2019m guessing she would support you in that.
