At first I thought everything was going great and that we matched well! A couple days after moving in one of the roommates told us that her parents were going to gift us their old furniture because they were planning on buying all new anyway. \n\nI was excited because our apartment did not come furnished and my roommates had already talked about going to buy furniture and we would all just split the cost. I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to afford that at the beginning of the school year and I\u2019m also more careful with the money I make. My parents don\u2019t help me with rent because I chose to move out instead of living at home and I also have a job I go to almost every day after classes. My roommates don\u2019t have to worry about money as much because they both work but their parents cover rent for them so they have extra to spend.\n\nAnyways, the same day her parents came and moved all the furniture in I got a venmo request for $75. I asked my roommate about it because I thought her parents were just being nice by giving us their old furniture. She actually said her family felt a lot of pressure to furnish the apartment by themselves and thought the whole situation was unfair because I haven\u2019t contributed anything at all to the apartment. This is not true because I previously sent her money to split the cost of cleaning supplies and I had also bought a Brita pitcher for everyone to use. She said she was being generous with the Venmo amount because her parents\u2019 furniture was worth thousands and the other roommate had already contributed by ordering a $75 rug so this was the only fair solution. We got into an argument and I refused to send her money because she never spent any to begin with, it was a gift from her parents. \n\nThe next morning I got a text saying there was going to be a \u201croommate meeting\u201d after I got back from work to settle things. When I walked into the apartment I noticed that there was a massive TV set up even though we all previously agreed not to get one for this semester because of our busy schedules. The girl who practically proclaimed herself head roommate told me \u201ccheck your venmo\u201d and there was a new request for $166 which now included the TV. \n\nI started crying and told them I couldn\u2019t handle all these additional expenses right now because I pay my own rent and everything left over I really need to save. They said I was probably lying about paying my own rent and was trying to make them feel bad by pretending to be poor. They said if I don\u2019t send the money by next week I shouldn\u2019t be allowed to hang out in the common area because it\u2019s unfair I didn\u2019t contribute to make it a \u201chome\u201d like they did.

Keep it in your room when not using it in the living room and that way you\u2019re not using \u2018their\u2019 furniture - and if they are going to use the TV when you\u2019re there then they\u2019ll just have to live with you being able to see/hear it - that\u2019s what happens in public spaces (which a common area is to a certain extent.)\n(And any other bits you may need for the living room)\n\nLastly!!

If she objects to that, well then she'll comprehend why you aren't paying her for that free furniture.", "Holy\u2026 NTA\n\nYou did not ask for any of the furniture, or the TV. If there were expectations of you to provide an equal amount of money and/or \u2018goods\u2019 for the apartment that should have been discussed, not thrust upon you with no warning. \n\nYou owe them nothing but your share of the rent/bills.", "NTA...If you didn't agree to pay beforehand, then they shouldn't be making requests, and you're under no obligation to pay.  People cannot simply decide after the fact that you're going to pay them money.  Hold your ground and just say no.  They're going to have to learn to communicate and negotiate.", "NTA  \nAt least now you know which roommate is a manipulative snake. \n\nEither her parents gifted the items and she is lying to you to make $ off their generosity.

No way in Hell.  What's next a hot tub and they wanting 1/3 of the cost, say 1500.00?  You didn't agree to any of this and need to tell them it was nice of her parents to gift them furniture, thank you, but they didn't pay anything so you are obligated to pay them nothing. and as far as the TV goes, again thank you for getting it, but that is on them, not you for the cost.  And walk away.", "NTA. Free furniture that your roommate is going to keep should not be costing you anything. A tv and rug that will ultimately move with one roommate should not cost you anything. If they want you to stay out of the common area then they should pay you not to use that space that you are entitled to.", "NTA. You did not ask for any of this, you didn't sign up for any of it. Your roommates are TAs. Stand up for yourself. Tell them you are going to use the common area and they'll just have to turn the TV you didn't ask for off when you go in there.", "NTA. You didn't agree to any of the expenses and you also won't get to keep any of the items when your lease is up. Don't send them any money, it sets a bad precedent for the remainder of your time together. Keep to yourself and be the \"difficult\" roommate if you have to. \n\nMy roommates in college tried to get me to pay for their groceries and do all of their dishes until I started keeping my things in my room and not being home.", "NTA. No one should be splitting the cost of items because then who is taking that item when you move out? Do you get to take the couch cushions since you paid for part of the couch? Each roommate might own different pieces and that means they get to keep them when they move out. Jointly buying shared furniture is stupid.", "Stop crying. That's not helping anything. Stop explaining your finances. That's just ammo for them to use.\n\nYou pay rent you are entitled to use the common areas. Period.\n\nYou don't own the TV. You don't have to pay.

You need to stay firm with them and tell them no. It is not your responsibility to pay off the tv the roommate wanted.", "Nta.  Also don't split the cost of non perishable items.  Because then what happens when one person moves out?   I learned this the hard way when I did this.  They kept everything and I didn't get anything,   nor any money back because of depreciation (I was much much younger).\n\nThere is some other good advice here", "So, if you pay for 1/3 of the TV, do you get to take 1/3 of it with you when you leave?", "This is so dishonest I think you need a lock on your door. Nta", "I hope you can get out of that lease. Run like hell. If this is day one your going to be miserable this semester. NTA.", "NTA. You can just make unilateral decisions about things like purchases for a home!!! They need to get your permission about things like this BEFORE they just go out and buy them. You did not agree to going in on the tv. Her request for you to pay for used furniture that was gifted to her is actually funny.\n\nI say plan on being out of there when the lease ends or find someone to take over your part of the lease because this roommate sounds like she is going to be a nightmare.", "NTA. Anything placed in the common area can be used by anyone else. If they don\u2019t want to share it they can keep the stuff in their room. Tell them you will never pay for anything you haven\u2019t already expressly agreed to, and you specifically agreed on no TV already. Go get some kind of decorations from a goodwill for a few bucks and tell them the total is over the $75 so you consider everything square.", "Oof, ESH. I would detangle these two things.\n\n1. Contributing $75 to furnish the apartment is reasonable- it's a flaming deal. Part of moving into an apartment is furnishing it and it's not unreasonable that her parents felt pressured to get you guys some basics. There also  no way your Brita and cleaning supplies equaled out that contribution. So tell them you'll need some time to scrape it together but pay her the $75.\n2. That said, it's totally unreasonable for them to assume that you're able or willing to join them in kitting out the apartment. Write out a script and then call another meeting to set boundaries around spending. Tell them that it's absolutely unacceptable for them to imply that you aren't broke, or to assume that you can spend the way they can spend. Let them know that you  aren't contributing to the TV since you agreed to not purchase one and that you won't be contributing to other furniture or electronic purchases. And that use of the common areas is included in your lease so that's not a card they have the legal or moral authority to play. You'll happily not use any of the electronics they buy but need them to understand that you have zero budget for other apartment amenities, welcome their getting them for themselves.\n\nHopefully they won't be hateful about it but these chicks don't sound particularly mature or level headed.", "Roomates: they shouldn't ask for money after the agreement has been made, and they don't get to tell you what you can and can't do in a shared space.\n\nBut\n\nOP: a share in the cleaning products and a water filter jug is not contributing a fair third to setting up the apartment. I can't comment whether $75 is a good deal on what they brought, or whether you need to get yourself to the shops, but this isn't a good start to a new living arrangement.\n\nESH", "NTA\n\nBut I am, if you can float the 75, do it, and then when you move out take 1/3 of the furniture with you to screw them over.", "Ask for her parents contact information and tell her you are going to arrange a payment plan with them. I'm betting the parents have not asked for the money but your room mates have decided you owe them for the parents generosity.\n\nOn the outside chance the parents have asked for the money explain that you are indeed poor despite their daughters arrogant assumption and are responsible for all your own bills and as such would never have agreed to pay an amount you couldn't afford. Then offer to pay $20 a month (or whatever you can afford) until their bill is settled. If you are polite and honest you'll likely shame them into telling you to forget about it if not you are not paying more than you can afford.\n\nIf they try to keep you out of communal areas report them to the landlord you have a legal right to use them irrespective of whatever your roomates choose to put in them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'd also note that if you pay $75 towards the furniture, you can then in future claim that you're a 1/5 owner of that furniture. When you move out, take whatever bits of it you like with you. I'd also start insisting on all expenses being shared on a document accessible to everyone, and that unanimous agreement was required to buy anything in future, in advance of that purchase.\n\nYour roommates aren't too smart. Isolating a roommate on week 1, when that roommate has a key and access to all their stuff? Very very stupid.\n\nThings have gone bad very quickly, so if I were you, start looking for a way out. Also see if you can, break the consensus - if one of your new roommates is driving this financial assault against you, speak to each of the others on their own, one at a time, and get them to understand your position. Don't let it be \"them\" vs you. If this woman is the nightmare I suspect her to be from your story thus far, chances are the other women aren't completely happy with her.

In my experience, roommates are jointly responsible for getting everything set up.  You got the sofa?  I\u2019ll bring a table and chairs etc.  So I agree that contributing to cleaning products and buying a pitcher isn\u2019t really an equal contribution to the setup.  However, we never did joint purchases where you own stuff together because roommate situations are usually by their nature temporary.  Everyone takes what they brought when you\u2019re not living together anymore.  It just makes things unnecessarily complicated and messy, especially if you can\u2019t agree who gets what.  In this situation, the roommate gets money and the couch, essentially making OP rent furniture from her.  It would have been better for them to decide what they need, and then figure out who will provide it.  To pay for a couch the roommate is basically borrowing from her parents is not right.", "Yeah I asked her who got the furniture when someone moves out because she\u2019s demanding money for it and she said that\u2019s for her parents to decide LOL.

I\u2019ve only known her for like barely a month, she is not my family!", "Then nope, if you send them money and she wants to keep the TV when she moves out then she'd need to buy you out. If her parents \"own\" the TV at moveout you don't need to pay for that shit.", ">She says she wants our apartment to feel like a home and family!\n\nTypical predatory behavior.
