Does the layout of the properties restrict access to portions of other properties? \n\nThere might be some right-of-way issues if so...", "I think it'd be reasonable to offer B access for specified purposes (say, I dunno, she had a kid and wanted to get a swing installed, it's probably easier to carry that through a yard than through the house) too, but as a basic principle, it's your yard, not a right of way.\n\nIt's definitely going to be annoying for her if she's been used to the convenience of wandering through your back yard, but that was a privilege never a right.\n\nNTA - and she's mostly an asshole for getting heated about it, rather than questioning at all.\n\n(With a side bet that if she'd approached you really pleasantly in the first place, you'd probably have been way likelier to offer an accommodation anyway!)", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStop discussing it.", "NTA - I live in a townhouse that is in the middle of the row. Our backyard is \u201clocked in\u201d. We access it through our house. Why would I demand my neighbours install a gate so I can access their backyards? It makes zero sense.", "Why do you have a landlord if you own your home? That's not how owning a home works.", "NTA. There's no reason in the world that she can't get a ladder or stepstool in case there is an emergency. Or, she can talk to whoever she rents from and demand that they provide a solution (that might be the best option as she'll likely push it too far and end up moving lol).", "That\u2019s how we feel! We obviously don\u2019t want anything to happen to her but if her building is on fire, we\u2019ll probably be on fire too. No matter what happens, if we leave the gate open on the shared side, she will still be trapped in our yard as the other exit gate is also locked.\n\nHowever, we also don\u2019t want to risk much more likely events happening (i.e. our snowblower/yard equipment being stolen, someone breaking in through the yard, someone opening the gate and being bitten by our dog, etc.) all because she is worried about a fire/break in happening.", "Exactly! I felt like a dick for thinking that but it\u2019s like\u2026 you chose to live somewhere that had the potential of being landlocked in the back.", "I just don\u2019t understand why with her logic, it falls on us to ensure her safety! We need to sacrifice our privacy and safety so she can stroll to and from. Plus, she was clearly trying to access our yard at some point today when she realized the gate wouldn\u2019t open.", "Minas Tirith  for the win.", "Nope! She put the blame on us since we were the ones that officially \u201cclosed her off\u201d.", "I think she'd get in and out of her property via the front door, and then there's a back door that opens onto the now-closed-in back yard?", "It\u2019s classified as a single family home and our town only requires front egress. She has her own front yard facing the street with a front door. She does still have a sizeable backyard and back door that she could escape from but she would be trapped as their property line is blocked by everyone\u2019s else property lines.", "Yes, she has a front door that leads to the street. She also has a back door and backyard that is still available to her, she just can\u2019t leave the backyard without climbing a fence. Our town only requires one point of exit which would be her front door.", "[Here is a picture](https://imgur.com/a/qk5x778) that explains the layout. According to the town, they have no right to our property, however, according to the owner/tenant, they believe they do. After we put up our fence (in orange), her backyard became landlocked. She still has access to go/leave from the front entrance which is all that is required by our town.", "We did offer access to the landlord (who owns the property)! Literally, you have to replace appliances or whatever, we\u2019ll open it up. It\u2019s just not a free for all, open 24/7. \n\nI think it\u2019s more so that she is annoyed that she can\u2019t walk through the yards. She does a lot of gardening and landscaping and I think the fence also now shades some of her plots. But again, those aren\u2019t our problems and it doesn\u2019t override the fact that it\u2019s our backyard and property.", "Any of those reasons are good enough, but he dog one esp.  Fences for dogs to keep them from wandering away is super common.", "Her concerns are about convenience, not safety. You've been entirely reasonable & accommodating about allowing access when there's a real need. If she's so concerned about bears coming through her front door & needing to run out through the back yard, she can move.", "Correct! She still has a backyard that she can use, she just cannot leave it unless she goes through the house.", "Isn't that usually how row house back yards work? She's weird.", "I am confused. Can the neighbor not escape through the front door? I get things happen in all parts of the house but that seems like a reach.", "Escape what? Fire? She can keep a step ladder handy.\n\nNTA... she is being illogical", "NTA. I feel for your neighbor, she is loosing access she thought she had. But she is a renter of the property next door. You own your property. As such you have a right to control access. You made a reasonable accommodation for access to the communal utility space. That is all you need to do. If she wants a back yard she should move to a rental unit which comes with one.", "NTA. I\u2019m having a hard time picturing exactly the space, but regardless it\u2019s your property. She does not need access to it. She doesn\u2019t need an exit through the back of her home. As others have said if she\u2019s really paranoid about something she can purchase a ladder or step stool to use in case of emergencies. Allowing her access to your backyard is a liability for you as a homeowner. You don\u2019t want her getting injured on your property that you allowed her entry to. It sucks for her that she thought the property she rented was more accessible that it was, but that seems to be on her landlord, not on you.", "Does she not have a front door? I\u2019ve lived in many townhomes that have a backyard that is locked in between others. Also did you get your other issue solved about the 10 feet?", "NTA\n\nWhoever has subdivided their property such that a tennant cannot access their home without going through your property is an asshole.", "NTA. Even some detached homes have such small side yards that they don't have gates and only have access to the house. You have no requirement to even provide access to the landlord of the house next door. And yet you still put in a gate to be neighborly. Sorry, neighbor. There's no reason for you to be able to wander through your yard freely. If there's a fire and she has to be evacuated from the backyard, I'm sure the fire department will be able to break down the fence.", "NTA assuming there is an exit at the front?\n\nWhat is the problem?", "ESH, you seem to be more concerned with being a jerk than a decent neighbor. What do you think she'd do anyway? If it's truly a safety matter you need to do better than stand on \"but it's MINE\"!", "Tbh the walls of Minas Tirith are nothing compared to a good old fashioned Gronding", "Points for the LOTR reference \ud83c\udfc5", "Thank you! We pointed out that several of our neighbors also have similar situations- none of them have gates. It\u2019s all apart of choosing to live in this type of home.", "Yes, she has a front door that leads to the street and still has a back door that still leads to the backyard! If her house catches on fire, ours will most likely be too so we\u2019ll all be in trouble. \n\nWhen I said that, she moved onto a burglary and at that point, I just gave up and just shrugged.", "She 100% has already complained to the landlord. Honestly, I agree, if this is such a big deal to her, she shouldn\u2019t be living in an attached house.", "The crazy thing is that she still has a back yard that is now completely fenced in and private, all free of charge! I get that it\u2018s now different than when she originally signed her lease and that she might not be happy but it\u2019s not fair for us to now make it up to her by allowing access to the yard.", "[Here is a badly drawn diagram](https://imgur.com/a/qk5x778) that wasn\u2019t allowed in the original post. I agree though! That is one of our main points, along with us not wanting her coming into the yard with our dog and potentially getting harmed. I don\u2019t understand how she doesn\u2019t understand our perspective!", "She does!\n\nYes, thankfully, the town was able to perform a \u201clot line revision\u201d after lots of time going back and forth and providing documentation. It\u2019s just been headache after headache with this house.", "She has complete access through the front of the house, it\u2019s just the backyard.", "It\u2019s a matter of leaving our backyard completely open and unlocked. We have a shed with valuables, a dog that we would like to stay safe and confined in his own backyard, and we would like to enjoy our own space without her just wandering through when she feels like it.", "The neighbor lady has a landlord.", "We own our home, our neighbor rents and has a landlord.", "Many one family houses have fenced backyards. WTF does she think people do \u201cwhen there\u2019s an emergency\u201d in those?", "Maybe she could buy a little step stool? Then in the case of this ridiculous emergency situation where someone is chasing her through her backyard ams blocking the door to the house she could easily jump over the fence?", "INFO: How do the neighbors on the other side of her manage exit from their enclosed back yard?", "Two means of egress are often required and frankly are a better arrangement in case of fire or the like. However she has the two means of egress her front and back doors.  In building code there is something called \"area of refuge\"--ie a place to get away from a building fire. Her front and back yards provide that. She has no need to come into your backyard.", "I like your little handdrawn picture lol", "Tell her to have a gate built in the fence that is in the back of her lot!", "Thanks! That clears it up, I wasn\u2019t picturing attached in my brain because I was thinking of corner lot homes my family has lived in. It seems like she seems like have understood this situation was always a possibility just based on what she rented. She just wants the status quo because it was in her favor.\n\nETA: just don\u2019t engage on her it anymore, if possible. A dog is reason enough alone to not have unlocked gates, and not allow someone to enter or exit whenever they feel like it.", "Thanks for the drawing. \n\nINFO: Does the landlord of B own the basement units under your residence and the B residence? I'm confused as to why anyone from B needs access to a basement door to A in the first place.\n\nAlso, why did the renter in B really want access to your yard? Does she park in the driveway? Something is missing.....", "Not to mention if she got hurt on your property", "The other middle unit (C) has a completely closed in backyard too, they own the unit and installed the fencing themselves- they did not install a gate because the end unit next to them would not give permission for their backyard to be used as an easement for access. The end unit (D- also owned by another couple) does not have any fencing and is completely open.", "No, the basements are separate. We originally agreed to put the gate as we did not want to have to pay someone to remove the fence panel and reinstall if B needed to get a large appliance into their basement (i.e. a water heater) through the bilco door as our lot directly faces the street we live on and the side street. \n\nThis was done as a good faith gesture with the property owner (not renter) before all of this nonsense started, even though it was not required. \n\nShe has nothing to do with our backyard. I think she\u2019s just used to the free access to walk to and from. She might also be upset that our fence now shades her garden plots but that\u2019s the only other reason I can think of. Her biggest issue is \u201cin case of an emergency\u201d.", "Sometimes there's an alleyway. I lived in a rowhome that had been converted into apartments, and there was an alleyway running behind all the backyards to provide rear access without having to go though any of the homes.", "I wish we had a similar system as it would avoid all of this!", "Ironically this was in a city notorious for terrible infrastructure."]}
