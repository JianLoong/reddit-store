Our backyard is \u201clocked in\u201d. We access it through our house. Why would I demand my neighbours install a gate so I can access their backyards? It makes zero sense.", "Why do you have a landlord if you own your home? That's not how owning a home works.", "NTA. There's no reason in the world that she can't get a ladder or stepstool in case there is an emergency. Or, she can talk to whoever she rents from and demand that they provide a solution (that might be the best option as she'll likely push it too far and end up moving lol).", "That\u2019s how we feel! We obviously don\u2019t want anything to happen to her but if her building is on fire, we\u2019ll probably be on fire too. No matter what happens, if we leave the gate open on the shared side, she will still be trapped in our yard as the other exit gate is also locked.\n\nHowever, we also don\u2019t want to risk much more likely events happening (i.e. our snowblower/yard equipment being stolen, someone breaking in through the yard, someone opening the gate and being bitten by our dog, etc.) all because she is worried about a fire/break in happening.", "Exactly! I felt like a dick for thinking that but it\u2019s like\u2026 you chose to live somewhere that had the potential of being landlocked in the back.", "I just don\u2019t understand why with her logic, it falls on us to ensure her safety! We need to sacrifice our privacy and safety so she can stroll to and from. Plus, she was clearly trying to access our yard at some point today when she realized the gate wouldn\u2019t open.", "Minas Tirith  for the win.", "Nope! She put the blame on us since we were the ones that officially \u201cclosed her off\u201d.", "I think she'd get in and out of her property via the front door, and then there's a back door that opens onto the now-closed-in back yard?", "It\u2019s classified as a single family home and our town only requires front egress. She has her own front yard facing the street with a front door. She does still have a sizeable backyard and back door that she could escape from but she would be trapped as their property line is blocked by everyone\u2019s else property lines.", "Yes, she has a front door that leads to the street. She also has a back door and backyard that is still available to her, she just can\u2019t leave the backyard without climbing a fence.

Literally, you have to replace appliances or whatever, we\u2019ll open it up. It\u2019s just not a free for all, open 24/7. \n\nI think it\u2019s more so that she is annoyed that she can\u2019t walk through the yards. She does a lot of gardening and landscaping and I think the fence also now shades some of her plots. But again, those aren\u2019t our problems and it doesn\u2019t override the fact that it\u2019s our backyard and property.", "Any of those reasons are good enough, but he dog one esp.  Fences for dogs to keep them from wandering away is super common.", "Her concerns are about convenience, not safety. You've been entirely reasonable & accommodating about allowing access when there's a real need. If she's so concerned about bears coming through her front door & needing to run out through the back yard, she can move.", "Correct! She still has a backyard that she can use, she just cannot leave it unless she goes through the house.", "Isn't that usually how row house back yards work? She's weird.", "I am confused. Can the neighbor not escape through the front door? I get things happen in all parts of the house but that seems like a reach.", "Escape what? Fire? She can keep a step ladder handy.\n\nNTA... she is being illogical", "NTA. I feel for your neighbor, she is loosing access she thought she had. But she is a renter of the property next door. You own your property. As such you have a right to control access. You made a reasonable accommodation for access to the communal utility space. That is all you need to do. If she wants a back yard she should move to a rental unit which comes with one.", "NTA. I\u2019m having a hard time picturing exactly the space, but regardless it\u2019s your property. She does not need access to it. She doesn\u2019t need an exit through the back of her home. As others have said if she\u2019s really paranoid about something she can purchase a ladder or step stool to use in case of emergencies. Allowing her access to your backyard is a liability for you as a homeowner. You don\u2019t want her getting injured on your property that you allowed her entry to. It sucks for her that she thought the property she rented was more accessible that it was, but that seems to be on her landlord, not on you.", "Does she not have a front door? I\u2019ve lived in many townhomes that have a backyard that is locked in between others. Also did you get your other issue solved about the 10 feet?", "NTA\n\nWhoever has subdivided their property such that a tennant cannot access their home without going through your property is an asshole.", "NTA. Even some detached homes have such small side yards that they don't have gates and only have access to the house. You have no requirement to even provide access to the landlord of the house next door. And yet you still put in a gate to be neighborly. Sorry, neighbor. There's no reason for you to be able to wander through your yard freely. If there's a fire and she has to be evacuated from the backyard, I'm sure the fire department will be able to break down the fence.", "NTA assuming there is an exit at the front?\n\nWhat is the problem?", "ESH, you seem to be more concerned with being a jerk than a decent neighbor.

If her house catches on fire, ours will most likely be too so we\u2019ll all be in trouble. \n\nWhen I said that, she moved onto a burglary and at that point, I just gave up and just shrugged.", "She 100% has already complained to the landlord. Honestly, I agree, if this is such a big deal to her, she shouldn\u2019t be living in an attached house.", "The crazy thing is that she still has a back yard that is now completely fenced in and private, all free of charge! I get that it\u2018s now different than when she originally signed her lease and that she might not be happy but it\u2019s not fair for us to now make it up to her by allowing access to the yard.", "[Here is a badly drawn diagram](https://imgur.com/a/qk5x778) that wasn\u2019t allowed in the original post.

However she has the two means of egress her front and back doors.  In building code there is something called \"area of refuge\"--ie a place to get away from a building fire. Her front and back yards provide that. She has no need to come into your backyard.", "I like your little handdrawn picture lol", "Tell her to have a gate built in the fence that is in the back of her lot!\n\nAnd if the rear fence is brick, have her buy an emergency ladder that she could keep in the backyard so she could climb over her back fence in case of fire.

That clears it up, I wasn\u2019t picturing attached in my brain because I was thinking of corner lot homes my family has lived in. It seems like she seems like have understood this situation was always a possibility just based on what she rented. She just wants the status quo because it was in her favor.\n\nETA: just don\u2019t engage on her it anymore, if possible. A dog is reason enough alone to not have unlocked gates, and not allow someone to enter or exit whenever they feel like it.", "Thanks for the drawing. \n\nINFO: Does the landlord of B own the basement units under your residence and the B residence? I'm confused as to why anyone from B needs access to a basement door to A in the first place.\n\nAlso, why did the renter in B really want access to your yard? Does she park in the driveway? Something is missing.....", "Not to mention if she got hurt on your property", "The other middle unit (C) has a completely closed in backyard too, they own the unit and installed the fencing themselves- they did not install a gate because the end unit next to them would not give permission for their backyard to be used as an easement for access. The end unit (D- also owned by another couple) does not have any fencing and is completely open.", "No, the basements are separate. We originally agreed to put the gate as we did not want to have to pay someone to remove the fence panel and reinstall if B needed to get a large appliance into their basement (i.e. a water heater) through the bilco door as our lot directly faces the street we live on and the side street. \n\nThis was done as a good faith gesture with the property owner (not renter) before all of this nonsense started, even though it was not required. \n\nShe has nothing to do with our backyard. I think she\u2019s just used to the free access to walk to and from. She might also be upset that our fence now shades her garden plots but that\u2019s the only other reason I can think of. Her biggest issue is \u201cin case of an emergency\u201d.", "Sometimes there's an alleyway.

I have lived in attached houses / townhouses before and their backyard fences had gates to a space or alley in the back that seperated them from other properties, so everyone had access From the back.   But if it doesn't have backyard access, then it doesn't have backyard acess, and that's that.  \n\nAnd, B will be able to escape, to her backyard.

She clearly thinks she is your Superior, since she was comfortable enough to attempt to enter your backyard without speaking to you, and harangue for not having access to your space", "I don\u2019t see why this is such an issue. If you were in your back yard and your house was on fire, you would have to break or hop over a fence to exit as well. I\u2019m sure her breaking the fence in such an extreme situation would be excused.", "So her logic is, if there's an emergency and she can't escape to the street via her front door, she would prefer to run through her backyard into yours and then out through your house or side yard to the street?", "What does the black rectangle behind the houses represent?\n\nIs it like a fence from other properties your row butts up against?", "She rented that property not yours.", "Yep my first thought during a robbery is running into a neighbor's backyard.

She feels that she needs two. \n\nThe thing that gets me is if there\u2019s a fire, like she\u2019s worried about, we\u2019ll also probably be on fire and the fire department is two seconds away.

She just cannot leave her yard through the gate that enters into our property.", "Want to also throw out that in the UK, the standard fence is made from thin wood that a small child can easily break by accident (this is from personal experience, I was that small child)", "NTA, I'm a long-term renter, and would be thrilled to receive a fenced in yard at no cost to me.", "Actually you often can", "Is she able to leave her backyard? Or is she fenced in on both sides.", "I'm in a townhouse neighborhood, and code here is that the fences cannot fully block off a middle neighbor's access. So, there has to be gates and openings for things like construction companies, lawn crews, and emergency escape for the middle neighbor - it's a fact of life for townhomes. \n\nI'm really surprised this isn't the code where OP is. I'm going against the grain and am saying YTA, because by keeping the gates locked, your neighbor is trapped in the event of an emergency that requires them to escape from the back.", "Yes, the lady that lived here before us often hung out with her in the backyard and would chat over the bushes. We have no interest in doing that.", "Well, I\u2019m going to have to listen to the ones that make that decision over a random person on Reddit on that one.", "A house fire.", "depends on the zombie. havent you ever seen night of the living dead? little girl used a trowel to (is it a rule violation if im talking about a movie?) her mom.", "Unless they are World War Z zombies in which case you're f****d as they are super fast", ">I don't think you're an American. You have a strange view of the US. \n\nI was born in the US, raised there, and spent most of my life there. I don't think you understand your country.\n\n>There's no way the zombie apocalypse would be over in the US in a matter of weeks.\n\nWorldwide a matter of weeks. It's incredibly easy to kill hordes of unarmed people with guns. Zombies are even less dangerous than living people.\n\n>Not everyone has a gun here. Most of the guns are owned by some of the people. It also will vary from state to state.\n\nCompared to most of the world, there are lots of guns in the US. There are stockpiles of rifles and ammo at Walmarts and Bass Pro Shops, to say nothing of gun shops. It's one of the few countries that allow ordinary citizens to own military grade weaponry, like anti-tank weapons. The police are all armed, with many police forces having tactical gear, sniper rifles, and even tanks. That's to say nothing of the armed security guards (in a lot of countries it's commonplace for police to not carry guns most of the time, let alone private security), and a LOT of people own guns they keep in their home for protection, a LOT of people open carry, a LOT of people conceal carry legally. America has a lot of guns per capita, and a lot of American citizens personally own guns. There really is a gun problem in the country that's not limited to a handful of people.\n\nAnd all of that is before we even take into account military bases strewn through out the country, and of course there's the national guard, state guards, and private armed militias. \n\nIn a zombie apocalypse in America you're pretty set. Inside the cities not only are there going to be lots of guns just because of the population concentration, but you'll also have large and well funded police forces to sweep up the zombies. You'll have less services as your location gets more rural, but in that case it's more likely that those around you will not only be armed, but armed with rifles as opposed to handguns.", "If she\u2019s really worried she can just keep a ladder by or against your fence in case of an emergency.", "I don't get it, she has no access to the street except through your backyard?", "[Here it is!](https://imgur.com/a/qk5x778) I linked it a few times but it wasn't allowed in the main post.", "She honestly should be asking her landlord. Not strangers who happened to become neighbors and have no legal obligation towards her.", "Well then NTA at all, the situation has nothing to do with right of way and she'll just have to suck it up.", "I've lived in several that are brick walls between. They're fairly easy to climb over though, did it many times as a student when we were friends with the neighbours", "She is completely fenced in. Other neighbors had already previously fenced their sides, our fence was the one that sealed her in.", "Her landlord can easily install a gate, right? We lived in a house like that and our next door neighbors had a gate replaced. It was a vinyl fence or something.", "Where I live this would not be allowed. That's why I vote everyone here sucks. You for building a fence right on the property line. Instead of two or three feet back from it. And her for her reaction. Yes it's inconvenient for her. And I understand why she's upset.", "My neighborhood is like this. Four homes all attached and backing up into a steep slope with heavy brush and a creek. If the two end neighbors fully fenced in, the middle neighbors wouldn't be able to bring around lawnmowers, construction equipment (e.g. one middle neighbor recently had a new balcony installed), or be able to escape if there was a fire or something blocking the front door.  Code here is that townhouses aren't allowed to completely fence in their neighbors.", "The problem is that their property line is superseded by everyone else's so they cannot put a gate in because no matter where it's placed, it would be on someone else's property lines and she would be entering into another person's backyard.", "Oh I see. Still, unless you want to, you don\u2019t have to give her free access to your backyard. Same goes for her other neighbor.", "You not seen the jumping the fences scene in Shawn of the Dead?\n\nhttps://youtu.be/_2srt1h-wGU", "100%, it's only a six foot fence. She is probably 5'10.", "Correct, the gate between us has a padlock, our driveway gate has keyed lock mechanism."]}
