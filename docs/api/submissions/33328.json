My (38F) MIL (61) and FIL (66) have always been irresponsible with money. They\u2019ve spent every penny and more that they\u2019ve earned and made no provision for retirement. My MIL hasn\u2019t really worked, but has always been a big spender. My FIL has planned to work until he dies, but he\u2019s had health issues for a few years now.\n\nMy DH (38) has a brother (28) and sister (41). SIL has inherited her mum\u2019s ways and overspends. BIL is more responsible, but doesn\u2019t earn a lot. Both BIL and SIL have relied a lot on in-laws over the years, both financially and childcare and general help. My husband has had nothing from his parents in the 20 years we\u2019ve been together, either financial or any of the usual things you do for family - help with moving, childcare, or even general care or support (he has always had to call them, for example). It\u2019s like adult neglect. My husband has done well for himself and we have both worked very hard to now have a comfortable lifestyle with a good sized house in a nice town. We don\u2019t have loads of spare cash, as most of it goes on renovating our house, which currently has an annex (longer term plan is that we use the annex as our kitchen).\n\nMy in-laws are great fun.

They are lovely people and we get on well enough with them for short periods and they\u2019re lovely to our children. \n\nHere\u2019s the AITA. My MIL has recently explained that FIL is likely to lose his job and they will have to live in our annex for the long term as they don\u2019t have any money.

I have said that his sister and brother should be paying them back, or they could live with his Grandma (she lives alone and needs care, but MIL would rather live here because it\u2019s nicer).
