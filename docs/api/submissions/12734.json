I'm with you. I like staying in a classier place with nicer amenities. Go for it and enjoy!", "NTA\n\nAs long as you spend enough time with your family you can enjoy your nice room when you all go to yours. It\u2019s not like you all will be together nonstop and sleep in the same room.\n\nyou say you never travel and this may your only chance. This is an extra reason for you not being an AH but I would strongly suggest for you to try and travel a bit. I know it may be the money but it\u2019s one thing worth saving for", "If you're going to Vegas in August or September having a nice pool with misters and lots of bars will be way better than the holiday Inn I would think. Don't even think about changing and staying in a crapph spot if you can help it", "NTA You want the whole Vegas experience. It's the one place you don't want to scrimp. I have been many times, and it's such a vibrant, fun place to be. I would try to convince your family that it's going to be worth it if they stay on the strip as well. From the Bellagio, you can walk to all the good places. Taxis are expensive, and busses are slow.", "INFO: could everyone in the family reasonably afford the better accommodations?\n\n- if they could afford it, then it is everyone\u2019s choice what their own preference would be for how to enjoy vacation. For some, spending money takes the fun out of an activity. Others don\u2019t care as much. Vacation is supposed to be fun, so I see no wrong and NAH.\n- If it would be difficult for the rest of your family to pay for a better hotel, then YWBTA. You would be putting yourself on a pedestal, basically saying where they are staying is not good enough for you. \n\nI feel you though. I\u2019ve done a lot of travel and if you get used to nicer places it is hard to appreciate lesser hotels especially if it\u2019s supposed to be vacation.", "NAH\n\nBut is it really a \u201cfamily\u201d vacation at that point?  If you don\u2019t actually want to vacation with them, just don\u2019t go.", "NTA - everyone is paying their own way. Your way has loftier aspirations. If they were say paying for flights or a car rental, and you\u2019re ditching them for luxury while still using the other parts, then you\u2019d be ta. But if y\u2019all are all paying your own accommodations, travel, etc, they can suck eggs.", "YWBTA, but I get where you are coming from too. \n\nMy family tends to stay at different hotels during trips and it's a royal pain. Those that can afford the nicer hotels do. But, transportation and meeting up then becomes difficult. Just going for breakfast is an entire ordeal because you can't just go downstairs to the hotel lobby, someone has to do their morning routine then drive/taxi/bus to the rest of the family who gets angry having breakfast so late. And who is going to travel when everyone insists everyone should go to them? Bleghhhh.", "You can do whatever makes you happy, but you aren't going to see the grand canyon from a vegas hotel room.", "YTA not for your preference but because on a family vacation, you\u2019re making it clear that you prioritize the fancy hotel over time and experience with family. How did you think they were going to feel?", "YTA if you are doing it despite knowing it's hurting your mothers feelings but you do you, you can book whatever hotel you want.", "YTA.\n\nIf this is a family trip then you should probably be staying with your family. I'm sorry for saying this but splurging out on expensive rooms while your family are 'slummed up', regardless of if it is their own choice, is just going to make you look like a pretentious dick who's waving his money in his family's face. \n\nJust wait until next year.

We plan on renting a car. Or as tourists is it better to go for public transpo when available?", "Yes they can easily afford better accommodations. Both my mother and grandmother make more than I do. We have 5 months to plan and save for the trip.\n\nI'll add the room they want to stay in is off the strip and is $180/night for a holiday Inn. I want to stay in a bellagio suite on the strip for $300/night. We're staying 3 nights so at most they will be saving $360 all in order to stay at a objectively worse location.\n\nWe live in FL so we're literally traveling across the country for this vacation, already planning to spend thousands.", "I guess we can all agree that vacation accommodations can make or break the trip, just like how pineapples make or break a pizza.", "I actually don't travel at all and that's why I want to splurge and have a nice time.

If OP has enough money to upgrade everyone, he can do that.\n\nIf OP doesn't have enough, he should just save some money now, and go on a solo holiday later.", "I don't go on vacations. Maybe once every decade.", "Do not rent a car. There is way too much traffic. Parking would be a nightmare. There is a bus system called the Deuce. It's a double-decker bus that stops at every major hotel on the strip and goes down to Fremont street. They run like every 15 minutes. You can buy a 24-hour pass for just a few dollars.", "nta let them know, if they can\u2019t agree then i don\u2019t see what\u2019s wrong with it. you\u2019re supposed to enjoy a vacation, live it up!", "I think you\u2019ve gotta look at two aspects:\n- to what extent is it rude\n- to what extent does it interfere with the intent of the trip\n\nI personally think it isn\u2019t necessarily rude. The group simply doesn\u2019t agree on where best to stay. \n\nOn the other hand if this will get in the way of group meals, coordinating activities, time together, you might still be an asshole for doing it. I could see where this might become a logistical pain for everyone just so you can stay in nicer hotels.", "My cousin got married in Vegas. It was a family wedding and we stayed off the strip because there were kids with us. There was a shuttle bus to get to the strip. \n\nNTA but find out if their hotel has a shuttle and where it goes in comparison to your hotel. If you're renting a car check distances between hotels..\n\nHave they checked distance/calculated inconvenience of staying off strip?", "GREAT example", "yes!  pineapples definitely make pizza better.", "NTA. I\u2019d do it. Idk if Circus Circus still exists - but it was a cheap Vegas stay at the time - and the carpets were sticky. Sticky!", "I get what you\u2019re saying, especially if you\u2019re paying your own way, but family vacations are hard enough to plan without the added problem of one person being in a different building or neighbourhood.  Not to mention hurting your mother\u2019s feelings.   How many other family members are going?  It may not be the costs to your mother and grandmother that are swaying to a cheaper hotel, OR maybe the others would be on your side and help convince a nicer stay.  \n\nCan you find a way to compromise?  You do the work looking into other hotels in the same price range?  If they give better deals with more room bookings.  Investigate the conveniences & marvels of the fancier places to talk the family into the benefits?   Could you get the best suite at the hotel they want?  \n\nDo you expect to spend a lot of time in your hotel room?  Sometimes spending money on the room is not worth it if you\u2019re only laying your head down to sleep.   If it\u2019s the proximity to the nightlife and after dark fun you want to explore, be upfront about it.  Maybe they\u2019re not considering", "OP says everyone could easily afford it. Makes the situation more complicated IMO", "Well you can splurge it up if you want. You have free will after all. But your family will probably view you as I said. If your mother is upset, then other members of your family probably are/will be as well. Being on vacation with a disgruntled family member(s) really takes all the fun out of it, and just isn't worth it in my opinion.", "Awesome. Thank you. Do you know if the rentable scooters are a thing there?", "finally, someone of culture.", "No, makes the OP an even bigger AH.   \nBecause this is a family together event, and he\u2019s choosing to be elsewhere for the duration, and could bring his family across the road to join him but is choosing to be separate.", "So when we go to the canyon and they all want to be cheap and not take a helicopter tour, I should sit out as well? Genuine question. Because that sounds super unfair to me. \ud83d\ude15\ud83d\ude1f", "Yes, there are several places that rent them", "They don\u2019t want to stay across the road though. They want the less expensive accommodations.\n\nI\u2019m not sure why anyone\u2019s preference is more valid than the other. I assume OP does not mind if everyone stayed in the nicer hotel.", "Okay so I read another comment of yours saying that your mother and grandmother actually make much more money than you, and now I'm conflicted. If they have that much cash on hand but just don't want to spend it then... Well, I guess it's not really fair to expect you to want to sit out on enjoying the finer things in life. \n\nSo I hereby change my opinion and deem you NTA.\n\nBut I'm still not sure whether or not you should get an awesome room and go on a helicopter tour. I guess it depends on how the rest of your family feel, and if they're going to be tense about it.", "NTA but if my parents had given me significant financial gifts to put me in the position to upgrade (college fund, home deposit etc) I'd consider upgrading them too.", "I think you should go on your own trip. I definitely don't think you're an asshole but if your mom and grandma both think you are, Reddit isn't going to fix this. \n\nYou say you never go on vacations, so the Grand Canyon and Vegas are pretty good for a make up vacation. I think you should go on the vacation you want. \n\nNAH.", "NTA. You can still meet them every morning to do stuff, your just having a better time lol", "It sounds like your vision of this family vacation differs from your mom's.  Is staying at different hotels the only thing that you want to do differently? Are you also planning to splurge on fine dining and premium seats at shows while the rest of the family eats moderately and sits in the upper tiers? You say that you \"never take vacations\" and \"this is a one-time thing.\" If you're honest, is this the once-in-a-lifetime travel experience you've always dreamt of?\n\nIf not, if you're going mainly because it's important to Mom, then how about going super budget this time and saving your money for the trip that YOU really want (even if that means returning to Vegas and the Grand Canyon on your terms)?\n\nIf that won't work, then at least commit to one event and one meal a day with the rest of the family.  Otherwise it will hardly qualify as a \"family vacation,\" IMO.\n\nSame City + Better Hotels + Fancy Meals + Premium Tickets = YWBTAH", "So, we're still 5 months out and we're starting to plan and book. This is the first hangup so far. I don't see dinner or shows being a problem cause my family hates \"the nosebleeds\" as they call them, and none of us are super pressed for fine dining. (Though we do argue about the tip. Lol) I can see them opting out entirely for a show, just wanting to retire for the night, but at that point I can pretty guilt free break away and enjoy my late nightlife. \n\nThe only other big thing I can see us not agreeing on is a helicopter tour at the canyon. They want to do a cheaper hummer tour and I want to fly. I'm not sure if I can afford both, or have time for both, so I'm at a bit of an impass there too.", "Vegas is very walkable.  I stayed at the Luxor last time I went and everything on the main strip is walking distance.  I took a taxi to Fremont and walked about there.  It's super flat so it's not at all taxing to walk around in Vegas.\n\nI rented a car didn't use it for any inside Vegas stuff but used it to get out of the city and do like a canyon hiking or whatever.  When I go again I'd do the same thing walk everywhere and just taxi from the strip to Fremont if I want to do that again.\n\nDef stay in a large hotel/casino right on the main thoroughfare.  The savings of staying in El cheapo hotel are lost to the inconvenience of it.", "If you really need a car sign up for Turo. There are a ton of cars available near the strip and you don\u2019t have to pay for parking.", "If you stay at the Cosmo. You can get a room that has better views of the fountain than most rooms at the bellagio.", "My first thought of Circus Circus.\nThis dates back to about 6 years ago."]}
