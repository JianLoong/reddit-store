It may not be the costs to your mother and grandmother that are swaying to a cheaper hotel, OR maybe the others would be on your side and help convince a nicer stay.  \n\nCan you find a way to compromise?  You do the work looking into other hotels in the same price range?  If they give better deals with more room bookings.  Investigate the conveniences & marvels of the fancier places to talk the family into the benefits?   Could you get the best suite at the hotel they want?  \n\nDo you expect to spend a lot of time in your hotel room?  Sometimes spending money on the room is not worth it if you\u2019re only laying your head down to sleep.

(Though we do argue about the tip. Lol) I can see them opting out entirely for a show, just wanting to retire for the night, but at that point I can pretty guilt free break away and enjoy my late nightlife. \n\nThe only other big thing I can see us not agreeing on is a helicopter tour at the canyon. They want to do a cheaper hummer tour and I want to fly. I'm not sure if I can afford both, or have time for both, so I'm at a bit of an impass there too.", "Vegas is very walkable.  I stayed at the Luxor last time I went and everything on the main strip is walking distance.  I took a taxi to Fremont and walked about there.  It's super flat so it's not at all taxing to walk around in Vegas.\n\nI rented a car didn't use it for any inside Vegas stuff but used it to get out of the city and do like a canyon hiking or whatever.  When I go again I'd do the same thing walk everywhere and just taxi from the strip to Fremont if I want to do that again.\n\nDef stay in a large hotel/casino right on the main thoroughfare.

But I don\u2019t really understand this. If you stay at an upscale hotel, you\u2019ll probably want to enjoy the pool and other amenities. So you\u2019re just going to meet your family for dinner, or see them at a casino? If you\u2019re going there with them- like as a family reunion or get together- you\u2019d see a lot more of them if you were all at the same hotel. Maybe that\u2019s what your trying to avoid? Staying at a different hotel gives you some space, and time away from them. Family reunion- lite.  I travel a lot - two or three countries a year - but usually just with my partner or one friend.

And if that's the case, they should *absolutely* book a hotel on the strip.\n\nThere are inexpensive hotels on the strip. Flamingo, LINQ, Circus Circus, etc. An off-strip hotel will likely only be cheaper by $20 or $30.\n\nPlus, if they stay off-strip, then they'll be spending money on a taxi to get them to the strip. For the cost of an off-strip hotel + taxi, they could just book a room on the strip. Or worse, if they rent a car, they have to deal with parking on the strip, which can be an expensive hassle.\n\nIt's honestly one of the biggest mistakes you can make when booking your first trip to Vegas, and I think u/CoolCrab69 's mom would regret it if she ends up staying off-strip.", "When I lived in Utah I drove to Vegas several times.

It's amazing. The off strip non-casino hotels are ok, but not the vegas experience imo.", "The holiday inn probably doesn't have resort fees or parking fees so they're saving more than that, but it seems kind of lame to stay in Vegas and not stay on the strip.

Just stay away from circus circus.", "Can you do the separate rooms and offer up your much nicer space as the \"getting ready to go out\"/\"touch base\" spot so that everyone can spend some time together enjoying each others' company and nice views before dinners/gambling/shows and everything else you guys plan to do?\n\nFor the record, I agree with you 100% on the room price. $120/night isn't that much for *three* nights when you're already spending all that money in other areas. Maybe if it were 7+ days, sure. I'm always blown away by how inexpensive you can get a pretty nice (or REALLY nice hotel room in Vegas) compared to prices you'd pay in my neck of the woods (New England). \n\nI once stayed in a corner room of the hard rock hotel (with amazing views and a full walk in shower) for under $100/night.

Depending on when your trip is the fountains at bellagio might not be running...They're actually going to be setting up the grand stands over the water front.

Are the places you are picking only slightly more expensive than where others want to stay?\n\nIf you want to stay somewhere else, at the end of the day, it is your money. But, what are you missing out on and what issues are you causing? For example, are you driving your own car, so that no one has to drop you off and pick you up from your hotel to do group activities?
