We both like cooking well enough and pay for subscriptions to several recipe websites (epicurious, nytimes) and consider it an investment because sometimes there's really creative stuff there. Especially since we've had to cut back on food spending recently and eating out often isn't viable, it's nice to have some decent options if we're feeling in the mood for something better than usual. (I make it sound like we're snobs but we eat box macaroni like once a week)\n\nBecause we work different hours, even though we're both WFH we almost never cook together, so I didn't find out until recently that she makes tweaks to basically every recipe she cooks. I had a suspicion for a while that she did this because I would use the same recipe to make something she did previously, and it would turn out noticeably different, but I brushed it off as her having more experience than me. But last week I had vet's day off on a day she always had off, and we decided to cook together because the chance to do it doesn't come up often. I like to have the recipe on my tablet, and while I was prepping stuff I kept noticing how she'd do things out of order or make substitutions for no reason and barely even glanced at the recipe.\n\nIt got to the point I was concerned she was going off the rails, so I would try to gently point out when she'd do things like put in red pepper when the recipe doesn't call for it or twice the salt. She dismissed it saying that we both prefer spicier food or that the recipe didn't call for enough salt to make it taste good because they were trying to make it look healthier for the nutrition section (???). It's not like I think her food tastes bad/too salty but i genuinely don't understand what the point of the recipe is or paying for the subs is if she's going to just make stuff up, and there's always a chance she's going to ruin it and waste food if she changes something. I got annoyed and said that the recipe was written with what it has for a reason, and she said she knows what we like (like I don't?), so I said she didn't know better than the professional chefs who make the recipes we use (& neither do I obviously)\n\nShe got really offended and said i always \"did this\" and when I asked what \"this\" was she said I also got mad at her once because she'd make all the bits left over after cooking into weird frankenstein meals. I barely remembered this until she brought up that time she made parm grilled cheese and I wouldn't even eat it (she mixed tomato paste, parm, & a bit of mayo to make a cheese filling because it was all we had.. yeah I wouldn't touch that with a ten foot pole even though she claimed it tasted good). She called me \"stiff\" and closed minded so I said i didn't get why she couldn't follow directions, even kids can follow a recipe, and it's been almost a week and we're both still sore about it.", "created_utc": 1668626641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yx3cle/aita_for_saying_my_girlfriend_thinks_she_knows/", "score": 796, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The recipes are still helpful to provide a loose guideline, but of course you should adjust them to reflect your own personal tastes. The best chefs in the world would tell you that.

We both like cooking well enough and pay for subscriptions to several recipe websites (epicurious, nytimes) and consider it an investment because sometimes there's really creative stuff there. Especially since we've had to cut back on food spending recently and eating out often isn't viable, it's nice to have some decent options if we're feeling in the mood for something better than usual. (I make it sound like we're snobs but we eat box macaroni like once a week)\n\nBecause we work different hours, even though we're both WFH we almost never cook together, so I didn't find out until recently that she makes tweaks to basically every recipe she cooks. I had a suspicion for a while that she did this because I would use the same recipe to make something she did previously, and it would turn out noticeably different, but I brushed it off as her having more experience than me. But last week I had vet's day off on a day she always had off, and we decided to cook together because the chance to do it doesn't come up often. I like to have the recipe on my tablet, and while I was prepping stuff I kept noticing how she'd do things out of order or make substitutions for no reason and barely even glanced at the recipe.\n\nIt got to the point I was concerned she was going off the rails, so I would try to gently point out when she'd do things like put in red pepper when the recipe doesn't call for it or twice the salt. She dismissed it saying that we both prefer spicier food or that the recipe didn't call for enough salt to make it taste good because they were trying to make it look healthier for the nutrition section (???). It's not like I think her food tastes bad/too salty but i genuinely don't understand what the point of the recipe is or paying for the subs is if she's going to just make stuff up, and there's always a chance she's going to ruin it and waste food if she changes something. I got annoyed and said that the recipe was written with what it has for a reason, and she said she knows what we like (like I don't?), so I said she didn't know better than the professional chefs who make the recipes we use (& neither do I obviously)\n\nShe got really offended and said i always \"did this\" and when I asked what \"this\" was she said I also got mad at her once because she'd make all the bits left over after cooking into weird frankenstein meals. I barely remembered this until she brought up that time she made parm grilled cheese and I wouldn't even eat it (she mixed tomato paste, parm, & a bit of mayo to make a cheese filling because it was all we had.. yeah I wouldn't touch that with a ten foot pole even though she claimed it tasted good). She called me \"stiff\" and closed minded so I said i didn't get why she couldn't follow directions, even kids can follow a recipe, and it's been almost a week and we're both still sore about it.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I didn\u2019t know shit about cooking until the last 2-3 years and I did the same as you. Bought cookbooks and signed up for subscriptions. I typically would make the recipe the first time by the book and follow all the rules perfectly. After I got comfortable, I would make changes and tweaks when I thought it was necessary (same goes for baking). That\u2019s the fun in cooking/baking, recipes always say that you can change it up. If you\u2019re doing it together, maybe next time have a conversation after the meal on ways you could each try making the recipe your own, seeing as though this is both a passion of yours.

I prefer America\u2019s Test Kitchen to either Epicurious or NYT, because ATK goes into the science behind the method so you can learn skills that you can apply to other recipes... or so you can feel confident improvising. Ex: if I\u2019m missing an ingredient, I almost never have to google what a good substitution is, because I have a base of knowledge that means I understand what it is that is important about the missing ingredient (flavor vs. pH vs. fat content etc). \n\nI\u2019ve never seen a commercially produced recipe (even from ATK!!) that actually uses an adequate amount of garlic.", "Recipes are intentionally designed to be bland to meet the needs of the absolute most people.

You have a different style of cooking and that is fine. Lots of people will try a recipe as written and then next time tweak it. Some very good cooks who know their spices and combinations are able to do that on the first try. My husband looks for a recipe as an idea than adds to it.

Will you add hot sauce to the meal after the fact if the recipe doesn't call for it?", "People who write recipes write for the person who almost never cooks. They get super specific, and \" put enough water so that the pasta is completely covered with a bit extra because some of it will be absorbed and you need some for later\" is ridiculous to write when you can say 4 cups of water. But the idea is that if you have made pasta prior than you have an idea what that process entails. I've never measured pasta water or rice water a day in my life.", ">But I always do all the steps, yeah, measuring the water included if its on the list. Is doing that pointless or something?\n\nYou (and the gf!) should watch \"Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat\" on Netflix! Because you follow recipes to a T you have a question like this; I'm getting the impression that you're not learning how to cook but rather just following instructions. If you took some spare time to learn the basics, you may not be so hesitant to her tweaks and feel more confident to do the same when you're cooking by yourself as well!\n\nRice you want to be precise because you don't want it to be too dry or mushy, pasta just needs to be submerged with extra water to account for loss via steam or absorption. Pasta water has starch in it and if you add some to your pasta sauce it helps the sauce cling to the noodle :)\n\nAlso, experimenting in the kitchen is supposed to be *fun*. It's art. Get messy, make mistakes, and learn. You're not submitting your dinner to a competition and I highly doubt your girlfriend is going to rake you over the coals if you add to much salt or put it in an herb that doesn't meld well one night. The kitchen in your home is a safe place to take cooking risks, and even if you can't be convinced to deviate and experiment, please don't deter your gf from doing it.  \n\n\nGood luck!", "You've actually hit on something really important here. Learning how to read a recipe and *understand* it is a really cool part of skilling up as a cook. Figuring out what all the different elements are doing, which parts are essential, what is flexible, what's been written to sound appealing vs what's actually true and necessary, etc. \n\nIn some recipes getting the amount of noodle boiling water right will be really helpful, perhaps because the starchy water will be used in further steps. In others it's irrelevant. Even when it is relevant, it won't be accurate to the drop and getting it approximately right is likely good enough and you can safely eyeball it. \n\nRecipes are a communication tool and a good one will include some explanations or indications about WHY it's been written the way it has and what's most important to get it right. But they're also an advertising tool and can definitely lie to you to make themselves sound better. For example, see this classic article from 10 years ago (!) about why recipes lie about how long you need to fry onions for to caramelise them: https://slate.com/human-interest/2012/05/how-to-cook-onions-why-recipe-writers-lie-and-lie-about-how-long-they-take-to-caramelize.html \n\nYou might enjoy websites like SeriousEats that showcase the recipe development process of switching up different variables (ingredients, cooking time) to observe the effect. Or there are some good youtube channels along those lines, such as Ethan Chlebowski.", "I think it's just using common sense and some critical thinking skills. You're using the water just to boil the pasta and discarding the water afterwards. The dried pasta isn't going to absorb all the water you measure and put into the pot. \n\n\nFor another recipe, yes perhaps you will need to to measure water like making packaged ramen or soup since you'll be cooking with the water, seasoning it, and eating it at the end. \n\n\nOr if you're cooking rice then yes you need to measure water because the rice *will* absorb all the water.", "[removed]", "Part of cooking is learning what is important to do exactly right and what is flexible. Baking generally needs careful measuring and shouldn't have adjustments without a fair amount of knowledge about baking chemistry. Most regular cooking is very forgiving. You can switch out ingredients and adjust amounts within reason based on taste. In a recipe, ingredients have a purpose, whether that is an amount of moisture or oil or caramelization or flavor development. People who cook a lot understand how to substitute in a way that the recipe still works well. Like, if a recipe calls for potatoes and you don't have those, you can use carrots just as easily because they have a similar texture and cooking profile. You would not want to substitute tomatoes without making other adjustments because tomatoes have much more acid and a completely different texture and cook time. If you want to make a recipe healthier, you can sometimes substitute cream for Greek yogurt but it depends on what the cream is supposed to do. Yogurt will add the right texture but may not emulsify other ingredients the same way. \n\nIf it makes you feel more comfortable to follow a recipe exactly, then do that, but you are in the tiny minority and definitely should not criticize your girlfriend for making substitutions.", ">I'll be honest the responses to this post are making me feel like a space alien.\n\nIt's good you are aware of this cause I think most of us are thinking it! \ud83d\ude06\n\nFor many people cooking is a passion and can be fun.

It sounds like you think you're not getting your money's worth out of the subscriptions you both pay for if what she does (as far as you're concerned) is tantamount to creating her own meal, independent of the recipe.\n\nIf this is *such* a big deal to you that you feel like her tweaks render the sub payments basically a waste of money, then why not simply cancel the subs you pay for instead of haranguing your girlfriend for going off book? You're not looking at the forest for the trees and that alone makes YTA.\n\nYou could have had a lovely time cooking with your girlfriend and instead you filtered your response to her creativity through a fiscal lens.

The simple truth is the 99% of all recipes for non-baking is meant to give you the rough outline of how to cook and how to cook something identical each time.\n\nEvery chef should tailor the food to their own tastes. Some like it more spicy, some like it less, preference over salt, health needs, etc. Even ingredients can change up. Don't like pork? Try chicken or pork. Not a fan of certain vegetables? Swap them around.\n\n\"Cooking is an art, not a science.\"\n\nThe only, *only*, form of cooking where you need to follow the recipe is Baking, and that's because it's more of a science than an art. And even there, with *experimentation* you can find a better recipe for what you like. There's a meme out there about how to change up your cookies. If you like crispy, use more of this, if you like soft, add more of that, you want them darker do this, etc.\n\nBut if you're 100% rigidly following the recipe on every dish you cook, that's fine. But you'll always make things taste the same. But by experimenting you can find you like it your way more than the book. The classic example is garlic. For a lot of westerners, garlic is the king of ingredients and adding more to dishes just makes them better. Even is some savory dishes that don't call for garlic, adding a few bulbs can elevate the dish far beyond what's in the book.\n\nThe book is trying to please the palate of as many people as possible and so, even if it is good, its not as good as if you tailor it your tastes.\n\nInfact, this is what professional chefs do all the time: they find a recipe they like and change the factors until it becomes something even better. New spices, different levels of spices, different ingredients, measurements, cook times, temperatures, etc. Even access to different ingredients can change things greatly.\n\nBut the main reason you're ana sshole is because up until you saw her cook, you didn't find anything objectionable with her food, generally. You even chalked up how the dishes taste different to her \"greater experience.\" I infer from that that you mostly enjoyed her cooking (aside from a one off dish you mention) and have had no reason to distrust her skills or approach.\n\nIt sounds like a kid that loves mom's best dish and then finds out years later that she ground up veggies into them so you'd eat your damn veggies and having a breakdown, refusing to ever eat it again.

That being said, I could understand being upset if you were expecting a specific recipe with specific ingredients and someone goes off script - that parm grilled cheese sounded repulsive. But if it\u2019s every day cooking and you do like the end result, there is no reason to object to it.
