I was feeling kind of bad for being upset over this but this made me feel like me feelings were justified. I do want to clear a couple things up.\n\nFirst off, I totally get why some people thought in this instance my husband was seeing helping with his child as \"babysitting\". Usually he's all for putting in 50/50 with our child. He stays up late, fixes bottles, changes diapers, etc. He's usually a very doting and loving father, which is why his comment threw me off so much. And my MIL has also helped a lot by watching my child so I can take naps or run errands, again which is why I was so thrown off by her comment.\n\nA lot of people asked about our living situation. We are temporarily staying with my MIL while saving for a down payment on a home. She stays at home and has offered to take care of the baby when I go back to work. There wasn't really anywhere else I could stay as others suggested either. My family has also been treating the surgery as no big deal and expected that I would have no problem with the baby. And even when they offered to come help for the day they all backed out last minute so I was feeling very on my own.\n\nAs far as the aftermath my husband and MIL both apologized for what they said. Everyone was exhausted from the 4 days I was in the hospital. My husband wasn't sleeping while at the hospital and my baby was apparently very fussy since it was the longest time she was away from me since giving birth to her so MIL had no sleep either and everyone was just frustrated with the entire situation. I guess they both just said the first thing that came into their heads with no sleep after I asked for help. I was honestly relieved because neither of them have ever acted like that before and it was completely out of nowhere. Everything has been good now. I am still healing but my husband and MIL have been a huge help with the baby. I go back to work in about 2 weeks and I'm trying to get as much rest as possible beforehand as well.", "created_utc": 1688160784, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nctg5/update_aita_for_wanting_more_help_with_my_child/", "score": 234, "replies": ["I\u2019m glad to hear you are being more supported now. \n\nRegardless of the explanation for their earlier response to your request for help, did they acknowledge that their expectations were completely unrealistic and, in fact, cruel to expect of anyone? \n\nBecause saying things in the heat of a tired and overwrought moment is one thing, but the basis of what is said (their belief that \u201ca mother\u2019s love for her child\u201d should be able to transcend physical inability and that your feelings and needs don\u2019t matter) is really alarming. If they truly carry those beliefs and just usually hide it better, then it could mean bad things for the future. (Taking it to an extreme, if you were diabetic and having a hypoglycemic event would they tell you to suck it up and delay treating yourself of the baby was crying? Would they tell you that severe depression should be ignored until it was convenient for them to support you in getting treatment because the baby needed something?)", "Glad to hear things are better. I still can\u2019t believe how mean they were to you for asking for more help after surgery. Especially when two of them couldn\u2019t seem to do it without you.", "My husband acknowledged that he was in the wrong and did not realize how much actual pain I was in. My MIL didn't but we are both a bit awkward with big emotions toward each other so I know she genuinely meant it.", "You don\u2019t have a baby and suddenly identify solely as a mother. You\u2019re allowed to have your own wants and needs. Your well-being and health is just as important as the baby\u2019s. (Maybe more since you\u2019re recovering from 2 surgeries and you\u2019ve also just grown a human being.)\n\nI\u2019m glad y\u2019all communicated and you finally got some help. It sounds like you gave each other some grace.  Hopefully y\u2019all\u2019s relationship will be better for it. This won\u2019t be the last time this happens, especially with all baby. Keep advocating for yourself and your needs. And enjoy motherhood <3", "Just read the original post . Wow. I really hope this is the last of this behavior from them but then I saw that you just had your baby so really they have helpful for approx 7 weeks Which is nothing. I hope the trend continues but just be prepared for a rocky road. No amount of sleep deprivation would cause two people to react that way. Doesn\u2019t bode well for them OP. Maybe get in touch with a couples therapist to make sure you guys are on the same page.", "You are absolutely not in the wrong. My mom stayed with me for a month and a half after my surgery, I stayed upstairs for a week because we all know when you go down you just want to start doing stuff and I\u2019m SO glad I did that. Honestly if anyone is able, have them bring you meals for a bit there is NOTHING wrong with that and after all the trauma and experience you\u2019ve been through you 10000000% DESERVE IT. The more you take care the faster you\u2019ll heal. The one advice I was given was take ALL the help you can if you have it.", "Walking after surgery is different from lifting.  You also just had a baby and then a surgery.  Everyone recovers differently.  I don't care if MIL had surgery and then competed in the Olympics.  She isn't you.  \n\nHusband needs to step up and be a partner.  I hope he actually apologized and not just acknowledged he was wrong.  Frankly he sucked for his response and then sucked again for whining to mommy.\n\nTake care of yourself and don't accept being treated poorly.\n\nI hope you are feeling better.", "I had a very minor appendectomy. Like the most minor appendicitis I could have had. I couldn\u2019t sit up for 2 weeks without excruciating pain, let alone carry a baby.", "Your MILs attitude is really troubling. It's like \"I suffered and sacrificed my health and physical well-being, so you should too\" and that's a really damaging mentality to have.\nAlso, what nonsense about risking her life, killing a tarantula to save her kids. Tarantulas aren't even dangerous to humans. Getting bit is on par with being stung by a bee, unless your allergic you're there is no danger to your life."]}
