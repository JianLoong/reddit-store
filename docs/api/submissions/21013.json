I was feeling kind of bad for being upset over this but this made me feel like me feelings were justified. I do want to clear a couple things up.\n\nFirst off, I totally get why some people thought in this instance my husband was seeing helping with his child as \"babysitting\". Usually he's all for putting in 50/50 with our child. He stays up late, fixes bottles, changes diapers, etc. He's usually a very doting and loving father, which is why his comment threw me off so much. And my MIL has also helped a lot by watching my child so I can take naps or run errands, again which is why I was so thrown off by her comment.\n\nA lot of people asked about our living situation. We are temporarily staying with my MIL while saving for a down payment on a home. She stays at home and has offered to take care of the baby when I go back to work. There wasn't really anywhere else I could stay as others suggested either. My family has also been treating the surgery as no big deal and expected that I would have no problem with the baby. And even when they offered to come help for the day they all backed out last minute so I was feeling very on my own.\n\nAs far as the aftermath my husband and MIL both apologized for what they said. Everyone was exhausted from the 4 days I was in the hospital. My husband wasn't sleeping while at the hospital and my baby was apparently very fussy since it was the longest time she was away from me since giving birth to her so MIL had no sleep either and everyone was just frustrated with the entire situation. I guess they both just said the first thing that came into their heads with no sleep after I asked for help. I was honestly relieved because neither of them have ever acted like that before and it was completely out of nowhere. Everything has been good now. I am still healing but my husband and MIL have been a huge help with the baby. I go back to work in about 2 weeks and I'm trying to get as much rest as possible beforehand as well.", "created_utc": 1688160784, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14nctg5/update_aita_for_wanting_more_help_with_my_child/", "score": 72, "replies": ["I\u2019m glad to hear you are being more supported now. \n\nRegardless of the explanation for their earlier response to your request for help, did they acknowledge that their expectations were completely unrealistic and, in fact, cruel to expect of anyone? \n\nBecause saying things in the heat of a tired and overwrought moment is one thing, but the basis of what is said (their belief that \u201ca mother\u2019s love for her child\u201d should be able to transcend physical inability and that your feelings and needs don\u2019t matter) is really alarming. If they truly carry those beliefs and just usually hide it better, then it could mean bad things for the future. (Taking it to an extreme, if you were diabetic and having a hypoglycemic event would they tell you to suck it up and delay treating yourself of the baby was crying? Would they tell you that severe depression should be ignored until it was convenient for them to support you in getting treatment because the baby needed something?)", "Glad to hear things are better. I still can\u2019t believe how men they were to you for asking for more help after surgery. Especially when two of them couldn\u2019t seem to do it without you.", "My husband acknowledged that he was in the wrong and did not realize how much actual pain I was in. My MIL didn't but we are both a bit awkward with big emotions toward each other so I know she genuinely meant it."]}
