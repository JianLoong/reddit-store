I told her quite early on, that I didn't want to cut to the cord. I know it's just me and that I'm making it weird, but I find it really squeamish to cut into human flesh. It seems like a medical procedure and I'm REALLY uncomfortable with it. My wife appeared to accept my decision at the time but under protest. \n\nNow the big day is upon us, my wife has pressed the issue again. I told her I want to be involved in every way I can, including catching the baby and handing him or her (we don't know the sex) to their new mum. \n\nI feel that my wife has a Hollywood idea of birth, including that I cut the cord. She also wants me to get in the shower with her and rub her back during labour, which she saw on a Netflix show. I've asked why the cord is so important to her and she couldn't say. AITA?\n\n\nEdit - To answer some common questions:\n\n1/ The squeamishness is only about the cutting. I am a first responder so I've seen every kind of gore you can think of. Blood, guts, screaming etc. I am used to these things. \n2/ I don't want to get in the shower but I will because it's a reasonable request and it's a way I can compromise given my feelings about the cord.\n\n\n(Probably) Final edit: Thanks so much for all your comments, I believe I have read all of them. We are going to go with mum cutting the cord while I hold her other hand and control the camera remote as she would like a photo of it. Some of you suggested this, many thanks. \n\nIt's 1am here (Victoria, Australia) and we go to the hospital in a few hours so here's hoping for a little sleep.

My husband didn't want to with our son and I was fine with that. When it all happened, though, the doctor asked him and he just did it sort of out of shock and probably feeling like he should. He said it was a lot more like jelly than he expected lol. He delivered our daughter on the bathroom floor by himself. I'm pretty sure the paramedics asked him if he wanted to, I can't remember if he did. Also, I did NOT want to be touched, spoken to, or looked at during my first lavour haha. Your wife might end up feeling that way.\n\nBirth is honestly really fucked up. I don't know how else to put it. Whatever way it happens it's going to be messy, bloody, and kind of violent. I suggest no one goes into it with any real expectations or big hopes about what might happen. I've seen so many people be depressed about their birth \"experience\" when the important thing is for everyone to come out alive and as unscathed as possible. \n\nMy husband stepped in my actual shit and my amniotic fluid exploded all over him when my daughter came out. He didn't care at the time even though that's obviously fucked lol. You might not mind cutting the cord. You might still say no. You might not even get the opportunity to either way. Just be there for each other and know how absolutely fucking terrifying the idea of giving birth is for someone. The person giving birth has so little control over anything that is going to happen or when that the little things they can control can really matter.", "NTA\n\nI've never met a single person whose birth plan went how they thought, from both big and little changes. But having one is comforting at a time of high stress and pain. I wouldn't argue about this with your (very pregnant!) wife if you don't have to - you know her wishes, she knows yours. No need to debate it. But decline and help her cuddle the baby while the cord is cut.\n\nI hope everything goes fabulously for all 3 of you!", "NTA\n\nIf you don't want to cut human flesh, especially if you feel that is a *violent* action to do towards another person or it is a medical procedure then you shouldn't.\n\nBut what do you mean you are going to catch the baby? I'm guessing she is planning on doing more of a home birth kind of thing? You do understand how messy and horrifying watching a birth can be with there also being a lot of tearing so if you are squeamish about cutting the cord I really think you need to make sure you know what you are getting in to.", "NTA - If you're not comfortable literally cutting the cord, I think the last thing that should be between you and your newborn is essentially a very sharp knife.", "Just popping in to say my husband was squeamish about it too and didn\u2019t cut the cord. I still felt like he advocated for me, protected me, encouraged me every step of the way and overall was an active partner through the entire process (including getting in the shower with me and doing hip presses during contractions which were a huge savior- pro tip pack swim trunks and bring a birth ball into the shower if you can). NTA just make sure to share with your wife all the ways you are eager to participate and support both her and your newborn and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be okay.", "NTA: My husband never cut the cord with our two boys and I don\u2019t care. \n\nHonestly my favourite thing was the midwife who took photos (I had a c-section) and one of them is my husband looking at our son for the first time. \n\nBeing truthful I don\u2019t know a lot of fathers who do cut the cord.", "NAH.   It's unfortunate that you aren't able to do one of the things she is dreaming of, but you aren't.  Both of you are communicating clearly so there won't be any surprises, and you don't have much time.  It is what it is.  \n\nAlso - have the two of you discussed what will happen if she ends up needing a Caesarean?  Sometimes they let the partner stay in the room - if you think that will be too uncomfortable for you, maybe discuss that ahead of time, and get out before you faint or vomit.  Or what happens if she and the baby get split up for a bit after the birth, will she want you to stay with her or go to the baby?   Have you seen pictures/video of placentas so you're prepared for that part?  \n\nIf the two of you get a chance to tell them at the hospital about your wishes/priorities, do speak directly to the medical personnel and whoever is listening to/recording/reading your birth plan, and tell them that although you know your wife wishes it, sadly you will not be able to cut the cord.  \n\nThe part about rubbing her back while she stands under hot water seems pretty straightforward, though. Just take some swim trunks and a towel and flipflops to the hospital (so you aren't ever walking barefoot on hospital floors, and you aren't risking slipping and falling.)  Do you have an issue with that one too?\n\nWhere possible, be gentle with her and be flexible with each other.  Where that is not possible, forgive each other.", "NAH here I guess but this is hardly a \u201cHollywood idea of birth.\u201d Both of the things you mentioned are completely normal and common.", "Info: Have you seen an umbilical cord before (in person or video/picture)? I wonder if you're overthinking it. I worked 4 years as a labor and delivery nurse before I switched units and umbilical cords are more like rubber hoses than anything else. To me, they never seemed like human flesh. The delivering provider will clamp the cord in two places and you'll cut between it, and it won't be super close to baby.\n\nNot trying to diminish your feelings on the matter or anything, just want to make sure you have correct expectations. For example, I don't like watching the initial incision on a c-section because it cuts through recognizable human flesh and my brain does not like that, but I've cut many umbilical cords and never had a problem (to me they are so far removed from what is recognizable as human). \n\nI don't know if any of this helps, or makes sense, but that's how it works for me.\n\nAnd it absolutely does not hurt the baby or the mom.", "You're a first responder so if you were responding to an unassisted birth would you still be too squeamish to cut the cord?", "NAH \n\nOf course you don't have to\n\nShe probably is just looking for more ways to share the experience with you. She's literally doing all of the work , maybe from her perspective, you doing that means you're taking a more active role. I doubt it'll matter at all in the moment because there will be an actual baby, which is way more exciting than cutting the cord.", "NTA if you don't feel comfortable doing it, don't do it. This is but a mere second in the baby's life. No one will really care in the long run...unless your wife makes a big deal about it. \n\nIt's not the momentous occasion that movies make it out to be.", "NTA. She can cut it if she wants.", "NTA, you\u2019re offering more than my hubby is lol. He won\u2019t catch our son even, he\u2019s super squeamish about bodily stuff and I don\u2019t want him to do anything he\u2019s not comfortable with. (Hell he even hates feeling heart beats lol) \n\nHe\u2019ll be a great dad regardless, he doesn\u2019t have to cut the cord or catch the baby to be one.", "i guess its to late if its already tomorrow. but have you thought of donating the umbilical cord? depending on with who, you can get on a preemptive list of ppl to receive cord blood if you guys need it for your child later, medically.\n\ngood excuse. \n\nI ...can't cut the cord. a professional has to, so they can professionally preserve the cord for our baby's future.", "NAH. We all have a vision of how we\u2019d like the birth to go. Can\u2019t blame her for that. But I don\u2019t blame you for not wanting to cut the cord either. My husband wanted to, but he was very shaky both times, and it freaked him out. But now he gets to point to the kids\u2019 belly buttons and say \u201cI helped make that!\u201d lol\n\nThey will ask you if you want to cut it in the delivery room. Just say \u201cno.\u201d She\u2019ll be busy and probably won\u2019t even notice you didn\u2019t do it. I didn\u2019t watch my husband do it either time. I was getting stitches. Trust me, she is not going to be worrying about this after the baby is here.", "NTA, You really should just go ahead and cut the cord.\n\nYou see that you're a first responder? I'm honestly surprised you haven't cut a cord before. If you're not generally grossed out by blood or gore or medical procedures, then you should just go ahead and do it. Literally anyone can. That's why it's traditional that the Father does.\n\nUnless you have some sort of literal medical phobia that prevents you from being around blood and whatnot, then you should just cut the cord. It's a relatively simple ask. Sure, you can put your foot down on this, but it's a poor choice of how to pick your battles.\n\nYou have every right not to, but you should, simply because your wife would like it. It's literally nothing.", "I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever heard the cord being called human flesh and it\u2019s a bit off putting.", "Life is full of uncomfortable moments. Your wife has had 9 months of them and you\u2019ve got a lot of them to look forward to while you look after a baby (like the baby vomiting in to your mouth moment). Lots of uncomfortable moments that you can\u2019t opt out of.\n\nBut this one you CAN opt out of. Why make life more uncomfortable than it needs to be? You wouldn\u2019t want her to do anything she was uncomfortable with if it was easy to opt out right? \n\nAlso the \u201cperfect birth\u201d doesn\u2019t include the father being grossed out, so cutting the cord while grossed out isn\u2019t really creating the best moment for her even if you try.\n\nNTA", "NAH. \n\nMy husband didn\u2019t want to cut the cord. Same as you, he felt really grossed out by it and it seemed like it would be hurting the baby, even though logically he knew it wouldn\u2019t. I had a c-section, so the nurses cut it. If I have a vaginal birth this time, either my mom or I will cut it. No big deal. \n\nI said NAH because pregnancy hormones have a way of making really insignificant things seem like a big deal, so I don\u2019t think your wife is an asshole either. I once cried for an hour because my husband didn\u2019t want to invite his cousin to our baby shower, so I was convinced he wasn\u2019t excited about our baby. Once the moment passed, I realized that sometimes, anxiety and hormones don\u2019t play well together. Definitely talk to your wife about it and reassure her of how excited you are, just in case pregnancy anxiety brain is rearing it\u2019s ugly head.", "NTA. You've discussed this early on, you're very supportive otherwise, and only have 1 simple boundary. This is very fair.", "NAH - I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a Hollywood idea of birth to have you cut cord but it\u2019s also okay to not do that if it makes you feel squeamish.", "Nta. Make sure the doctors know how you feel so they know not to ask.", "Nta if you don\u2019t want to\nThen you don\u2019t want to. But my husband didn\u2019t until the moment came and he did\u2026so don\u2019t over think it.", "Info:  is this a home birth?  You don't really catch the baby and no hospital that I'm aware of does the shower thing.", "You can take a swimsuit and wear it in the shower and help support her, then you'll feel more comfortable and she'll have someone she trusts there during the hardest time of her life. Explain to her why you don't want to cut the cord. She can actually cut it if she wants, or the doctor can. It can sometimes be difficult or messy. Maybe you could be holding the baby while they are cutting the cord.", "NTA, my fianc\u00e9 isn\u2019t sure he can even look at the cord without feeling squeamish. Don\u2019t feel bad, it is what it is. I put in my birth plan if he can\u2019t do it I will. Good luck, hope everything goes well with the birth of your baby!", "My husband didn't either.  Don't blame him, to be perfectly honest I'd have rathered not be in close proximity myself.  Shit like this doesn't matter, it's showing up day after day and being an involved parent that counts.  NAH", "NTA, you don't have to do anything that makes you uncomfortable. My husband didn't cut the cord or look when the baby was crowning. He told me before that he didn't want to do those two things specifically. He is squeamish and anxious. I don't even remember for either one if the doctor asked him. Or if he changed his mind actually! \ud83d\ude06 I was so out of it for both, I wasn't paying attention. I'll have to ask him.", "NTA. I have 2 kids and my partner didn't cut either of their cords. Ultimately, it's your decision. It might seem important now, but once she's in labour everything else will quickly stop mattering.", "Could you say a no that sounds like a yes? Like when they ask say \u201cI would love to be involved, may I hold him while it gets cut?\u201d Or something which gets you in there while not doing the actual cutting part. Or ask you wife if she wants to plan for her to cut it if she feels strongly about the cord being cut? With support obviously. I also think there will be so much going on in those first seconds after birth that fears, wants, and things you fixate on for the duration of your pregnancy kind of get lost in the chaos of the moment often.", "NTA just because there doesn't need to be anything that could potentially go wrong, and if you're uncomfortable, something could go wrong. \n\nThat said, I don't understand you. Call me crazy, but if I were to ever have a kid, I'd ask if I could sterilize my personal knife and use that. It's symbolic, I guess", "When doc asked my husband if he wanted to cut the cord he turned white and nearly fainted, a nurse had to grab the IV stand he wobbled into. The man loves us enough to be there but can\u2019t handle any kind of body stuff at all. You do what you can. It won\u2019t matter once those little eyes are looking into hers.", "I\u2019m pregnant rn and I would never expect my husband to have to do that. Just be there for your wife and newborn. The doctors can handle the umbilical cord\n\nNTA", "NTA. The thought of an umbilical cord being cut has made me feel queasy my entire life. I\u2019m a cis woman so if I have a child I wouldn\u2019t be the one cutting the cord (thank god) but I\u2019ve just had a weird intrusive thought my whole life about the act and feeling of cutting through an umbilical cord and it makes me feel physically ill lol. It sounds silly but I\u2019m totally with you. You shouldn\u2019t have to do this if you\u2019re not comfortable. It doesn\u2019t take away anything from your wife or the baby.", "NTA but it does seem important to your wife. I was fine with my husband not wanting to do it. My doula actually cut the cord! Is there anyone else who could do it like that? Will your wife read these replies and realize it's very normal to not want to cut the cord?", "How you think things are going to go is probably quite different from what will actually happen. By the time that baby is born I suspect she won\u2019t care. \n\nFWIW my husband is squeamish and did it. I don\u2019t see the big deal but I guess it helps the dads feel involved.", "Cut the cord, it lets you be part of the new life, and it took me two snips.", "NTA she doesn\u2019t need you fainting; though she\u2019s going to spend hours feeling like she\u2019s trying to pass a bowling ball (I couldn\u2019t get an epidural; low BP) so if you find when the moment comes and you\u2019re euphoric and want to surprise her it\u2019d be nice. If not she\u2019ll just be focused on your beautiful baby.", "Nta.  My ex didn't want to cut the cord either.  Your choice.   I couldn't then and still don't see why it's expected.", "NTA\n\nYour wife needs to accept that you aren't comfortable doing it. That is your right as a human adult. She has no right to \"press the issue\".

It\u2019s your choice and you have the right to decide. \n\nBut she is going through 9 months of pregnancy, discomfort, organs shifting everywhere, hormones all over the place and way more. Even after she gives birth, it will still be a few more months of discomfort. Giving birth is really not easy. Someone I know went into labor, asked for an epidural but couldn\u2019t receive one, went through hours of excruciating pain. Maybe consider feeling uncomfortable for a few seconds? \n\nStill not the asshole though.", "NAH - I wouldn't cut the cord either. It's a thing you're either comfortable with or you're not.", "NTA but just so you know, there are no nerve endings in the cord, so it will not hurt her or the baby.", "NTA , I have the best husband and he didn't feel comfortable cutting the cord so he didn't.\n\nAlthough if she has her mind set just agree and just tell the dr once she delivers the baby that you don't want to and I highly doubt your wife will even notice. After the pain and holding your baby for the first time I don't even notice what's happening between your legs", "My husband said no to a lot of the birth experience before we got there - no looking below the sheet, no cutting the cord, no holding the baby before the nurses clean her up, etc. I wasn't too worried about what he wanted to do, since I had my own job to manage.\n\nWhen we were in the room, in the thick of it, he couldn't not do it. He was right there, saw and  did everything. The moment of seeing our daughter be born made him want to be a part of it in a way that he didn't think he would. \n\nNTA for your feelings before, but you might feel different when it's happening.", "NTA.  My husband didn't want to either with our first - he knew even before her birth, but I wanted him to wait on making the final decision until it was actually time - so you know who the doctor asked next?  Me!!  It was really pretty amazing...it was like a physical, almost ritualistic acknowledgement that she was her very own person with her very own life.  Maybe your wife would be interested in cutting your baby's cord herself?\n\nThat being said, my husband did express regret later and that after watching me cut the cord he felt like he'd denied himself something incredibly special.  Fortunately was able to do the honors with our second child.  By that time, after dealing with spitups, diapers, and blowouts, he was no longer put off by cutting the cord.\n\nI hope that can be the case for you, too, but if not, maybe you could cup your hands around your wife's as support while she does the honors?", "Dude, as a first responder you have seen much worse.\nJust cut it .", "I think it\u2019s a support thing, she\u2019s going through the worst pain imaginable, risking her life, and giving herself permanent bodily damage to have your child and she wants you to contribute so she feels less alone. I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t want to give birth, but she can\u2019t just say no thanks like you can so that\u2019s not a hill I would die on. I would just be there for my partner in that situation in anyway she needed me to be.", "Are you going to be squeamish about cutting your kid's fingernails?\n\nIt's not flesh - it's something that's no longer part of the mother or the child's body.\n\nBut, it's a personal choice.

I was surprised how \"fibrous\" it was, like cutting through a bundle of strings.", "She needs to stop watching the Hollywood version of giving birth and watch actual videos of it\u2026.very very different.

She wants it to be a special beautiful memorable day - and it will be - after hours of screaming, crying, and likely pooping in the doctor's hand lol.

This is a natural thing to be squeamish about. Even if it's your job/career. \n\nCutting the cord is part of a medical procedure. That medical procedure is giving birth/delivering a baby. There's an entire section of the medical field that focuses on the health and welfare of mother and infant to make sure both come out okay.

She also wants me to get in the shower with her and rub her back during labour, which she saw on a Netflix show.\n\nAnd you should never base your medical care or the medical care of your child on a tv show. Full stop. That's the easiest way to get sick or worsen already present conditions. \n\nNTA OP. You have every right to tell your wife \"no\" on this.

Maybe in the moment he changed his mind because we weren't sure if this was going to be our only kid (and we did end up being a one-and-done family) and he didn't want to miss out, or maybe Hollywood prepared him for a lot worse and then my labor wasn't nearly as screaming and traumatic as all that so he was able to get more chill about the whole thing, idk.

My mum was also there so she held my hand while that happened, but he told me before he wasn\u2019t comfortable with it and I respected his boundaries. However the shower and rubbing your back is totally normal and really really helps while you are in labour, my husband did this and it helped me so so much when I had my first baby. It\u2019s a really simple and affective way to support your wife and show her you are there to support her, and gets you involved in the labour and she will appreciate you for it.

Likewise not squeamish at all, it's that I think cutting a tiny human being's live flesh should be the job of one of the many medical professionals in the room.

Having my kids\u2019 dad present and cutting the cord felt important because it\u2019s tangible differences between the two that brought me comfort.  However, my backup was that I, myself would cut it which still would have differed from my own birth where they didn\u2019t offer that to the mother.
