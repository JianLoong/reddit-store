We have sent out our invites and they are slowly starting to come back to us. We have family across the globe and with our postal service strikes, we decided to send them out early. \n\nWe invited one of our friends (mid 20s F) and her partner (late 20s M). Her partner has been difficult. When we sent out the invites, he called me asking if the options on the invite, were the only ones available. The options are grilled salmon with a lemon and caper sauce, grilled chicken or mushroom stroganoff. The salmon and chicken come with baby potatoes and seasonal vegetables. I told him these were the only options, and we wouldn't be adding more but they can be amended if he has a dietary preference - one of our guests is a dairy free vegetarian and the stroganoff is being made vegan for them. He said he didn't like fish or mushrooms and thinks chicken is a bit plain for a wedding before settling on the chicken. A couple days later, he calls to change his mind and decides he will have the salmon. He then proceeded to jump between all 3 options a couple times, each time finding a reason to why he didn't want it (Salmon tastes too fishy, the chicken will be dry, stroganoff is too heavy for a wedding meal, etc). \n\nThis morning, I got a call from my caterer (who is his partner's brother), and he's contacted her asking if she can make him his own specific meal. He's asking for an expensive steak, vegetables, boiled potatoes and peppercorn sauce. I'll admit I kind saw red and called him annoyed that he tried to go around me and order what he wanted. The caterer laughed at him and told him that he had the options available and just to pick one. When I called him, I told him that he will be having the chicken and that if he doesn't like it then he can just go without as I won't have him calling the caterer to order something completely different. He wasn't happy when I told him, he argued I was being a bridezilla and that I needed to get off my high horse. His partner has also been in touch, constantly sending me messages about how I know that he needs to have 'proper' meat at every meal otherwise he's sick and that fish and chicken won't sustain him, and that 'it's just one steak, it's not like he's asking you to serve him a cow.' It's ridiculous, he can go without red meat for one meal, it won't kill him.\n\nAITA for suggesting that he gets what he is served or goes without?", "created_utc": 1669071878, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1dbae/aita_for_telling_a_wedding_guest_that_he_can/", "score": 2351, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And he was only a plus one!\n\nWeird guy.\n\nNTA", "NTA at all, he is not entitled to have his own separate meal just because he's picky. He went BEHIND YOUR BACK and then your friend encouraged/engaged in his behavior. You already have three options and it wouldn't be fair to you or your other guests that he gets a special meal.\n\nOff topic I now want mushroom stroganoff \ud83e\udd23", "NTA. its not too late to uninvite the friend and plus one snob. \n\nJust uninvite them, there very rude and very entitled. Do you want to hear complaints from them throughout your whole wedding. Or guests gossiping about them complaining. \n\nDon't bother with them, they're not good friends.", "Does he feel so emboldened *because* his brother is the caterer? Or did I read that wrong? \n\nI would have put that earlier in the story, it seems especially intentional knowing his connection to your wedding.", "NTA. Option 1don't eat. Option 2 eat what's served. Option 3 Stay home. You have a long and happy marriage.", "NTA\n\nThis just reminded me of that old video \"The annoying thing\"...LOL", "NTA I\u2019d contact the friend who's the real guest. He's just the +1 and could be replaced any day. \n\nI'd ask her if she's aware what her bf is doing. If she is I'd tell her that under these circumstances they're no longer invited. If she's not aware I'd ask her to leave this guy at home and come alone or bring another friend. \n\nSome people are unbelievable. The entitlement of this guy. And he's not even the invited friend but just the person dating the friend.", "Have you told his partner?", "NTA \n\nDisinvite that person immediately.", "I think you meant \u201cmore clear cuts\u201d. Gotta recognize what\u2019s at \u201csteak\u201d here.", "100% Why are these guestzilla's still invited?", "No joke my stepdad does this after we go somewhere and he doesn\u2019t like the food \ud83d\ude02 the other day we were at a function where most of the food was vegan or vegetarian and he stopped at KFC on the way home!", "OP should get the caterer to serve the steak frozen meal at the reception\ud83d\ude05", "I think OP mentioned somewhere that he already knew the caterer personally. So its possible that the topic of OP's wedding came up and he got to know.", "True, but it will specify the venue which often have in house caterers - he might have just contacted them", "NTA - Not at all the AH! He got three pretty different options. It will not kill him to not have cow meat for one meal. I would just tell them what this good person has written out for you. It is such a beautiful reply. Haha", "Yeah okay good point!", "Not that there is a chance of there being a whole peppercorn in a McDonald's but I would shove whole peppercorns in the burger and just let him break his teeth", "Furthermore with the bride approval", "Haha! I used to work in a position that was somewhat customer facing, but privileged customers, if you know what I mean. It honed my skills on how to say \"you're an idiot\" while being super nice where they couldn't complain. I'm a bit out of practice and have less effs to give these days.", "Better do him a Mongol, stay on the horse and shoot his kneecaps at a hundred paces away.", "But he's thier pal, bro!", "It says in the post that the caterer is guestzilla's partner's brother (I think - the pronouns are a bit hard to follow at that point).", "I'm genuinely not trying to be rude but \"tamponade\" instead of tapenade made me cackle.", "That's too funny, I love that.", ">\"tamponade\" instead of tapenade\n\nWhat, you don't make a lemonade-style concoction out of your tampons? It's great on chicken apparently.", "It's a must have at any vampire summer barbecue"]}
