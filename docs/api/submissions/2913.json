We have sent out our invites and they are slowly starting to come back to us. We have family across the globe and with our postal service strikes, we decided to send them out early. \n\nWe invited one of our friends (mid 20s F) and her partner (late 20s M). Her partner has been difficult. When we sent out the invites, he called me asking if the options on the invite, were the only ones available. The options are grilled salmon with a lemon and caper sauce, grilled chicken or mushroom stroganoff. The salmon and chicken come with baby potatoes and seasonal vegetables. I told him these were the only options, and we wouldn't be adding more but they can be amended if he has a dietary preference - one of our guests is a dairy free vegetarian and the stroganoff is being made vegan for them. He said he didn't like fish or mushrooms and thinks chicken is a bit plain for a wedding before settling on the chicken. A couple days later, he calls to change his mind and decides he will have the salmon. He then proceeded to jump between all 3 options a couple times, each time finding a reason to why he didn't want it (Salmon tastes too fishy, the chicken will be dry, stroganoff is too heavy for a wedding meal, etc). \n\nThis morning, I got a call from my caterer (who is his partner's brother), and he's contacted her asking if she can make him his own specific meal. He's asking for an expensive steak, vegetables, boiled potatoes and peppercorn sauce. I'll admit I kind saw red and called him annoyed that he tried to go around me and order what he wanted. The caterer laughed at him and told him that he had the options available and just to pick one. When I called him, I told him that he will be having the chicken and that if he doesn't like it then he can just go without as I won't have him calling the caterer to order something completely different. He wasn't happy when I told him, he argued I was being a bridezilla and that I needed to get off my high horse. His partner has also been in touch, constantly sending me messages about how I know that he needs to have 'proper' meat at every meal otherwise he's sick and that fish and chicken won't sustain him, and that 'it's just one steak, it's not like he's asking you to serve him a cow.' It's ridiculous, he can go without red meat for one meal, it won't kill him.\n\nAITA for suggesting that he gets what he is served or goes without?", "created_utc": 1669071878, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1dbae/aita_for_telling_a_wedding_guest_that_he_can/", "score": 88, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Cooking entirely one separate steak and sauce would be money and a chef having to focus on that. And I\u2019m not sure what kind of venue it is but if they don\u2019t have anything else they are doing that would require ordering in a single steak when steaks are normally a big shoulder/rump that the chef cut up themselves. That is not a typical kind of provisioning when you are in catering to have a single steak. \n\nHe is a ridiculous asshole and you are NTA. Having a meal that\u2019s not his favorite won\u2019t kill him.", "NTA. Bridezilla? He doesn't know what the word means. Is there such a thing as a guestzilla? You have been more than accommodating.

You\u2019ve been very accommodating with this guy.

He is a Guestzilla!! As other posters said disinvite them.

I\u2019m hurt that he went behind my back, called the caterer and tried and upgrade his meal. Fianc\u00e9 name and I really want everyone to enjoy themselves, he clearly will not, and I think it\u2019s best you two to not attend. I really do not want this to affect our friendship and I cannot wait to see you after the honeymoon and catch up. \n\n*that of course if you want to remain friends with her.

If he can't make a choice from the options available he can eat beforehand or afterwards.", "NTA Confused why he is still invited??? He called your caterer behind your back- doesnt matter if he knows them.  Thats it he's out.\n\nHe can eat a steak before he arrives.", "I could totally see like a cousin or Aunt/Uncle trying to pull this, the the PLUS 1 of just a FRIEND?!? Absolutely atrocious behavior. I'm mortified for you. NTA.", "You are so NTA. The only acceptable response from a guest to whom none of the options appeal is to graciously pick one and pretend to enjoy it. His behavior is entirely beyond the pale.", "NTA! This guy has some nerve contacting the caterer. You're not a bridezilla, this guy is guestzilla he is so rude.", "NTA. Agreed with everyone else, I would uninvite them both and cut off the friendships. But if you DON'T want to do that, then tell him he can show up to the wedding with a steak in a lunch pale and then explain to all the other guests why he can't eat any of the options offered. Hopefully it will embarrass the hell out him, and deservedly so. \n\nSo that's his option - chicken you provide, steak he brings (but cannot be reheated or microwaved), he skips the wedding, or he doesn't eat. And if he's too inflexible to accept one of those options, then you'll have to withdraw the invitation.", "NTA\n\nThat would annoy the hell out of me.... lol, I'd have told him never mind, don't bother coming.", "NTA, the entitled guess is TA, BIG TIME.", "NTA that guy is behaving horribly. I would have put an end to him changing his Ming way before you did. Calling the caterer directly is completely inappropriate in every way. He has no manners.

Rescinding the invitation to this super special guest sounds good to me.", "NTA, \n\nI would uninvite him personally after the stunt of calling the caterer and then calling *you* a bridezilla... he is hands down going to cause drama at your wedding.", "NTA at all. He should grow up tf. Its your wedding. him and the partner ATA.", "NTA He\u2019s definitely being a guestzilla, yikes. If the multiple options you are providing are not sufficient, I would let him know he\u2019s welcome to order his own food from somewhere else and eat before the event. If that\u2019s still not good enough, then you apologize you won\u2019t be able to accommodate his dietary demands and it\u2019s better if he not attend. You wouldn\u2019t want him getting sick. At this point, it sounds like he\u2019ll be an ass at the actual event, so I\u2019d be tempted to cancel the invite and save yourself the trouble and drama at your special event.", "NTA\n\n Those options sound delicious especially the mushroom stroganoff", "NTA. He is a \"guesszilla\", if it is such a problem then he can have his steak... at home. Honestly, not sustain him, a wedding meal?! Well this man seems to have a very toxic attitude, and your friend sounds like she is not in a very healthy relationship. His attitude and her response look like red flags to me.", "NTA. I'm suggesting you rescind the invitation, as you don't want him to get sick on your account.", "Uninvited them lol fuck that. Nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
