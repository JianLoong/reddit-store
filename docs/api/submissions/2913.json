We have sent out our invites and they are slowly starting to come back to us. We have family across the globe and with our postal service strikes, we decided to send them out early. \n\nWe invited one of our friends (mid 20s F) and her partner (late 20s M). Her partner has been difficult. When we sent out the invites, he called me asking if the options on the invite, were the only ones available. The options are grilled salmon with a lemon and caper sauce, grilled chicken or mushroom stroganoff. The salmon and chicken come with baby potatoes and seasonal vegetables. I told him these were the only options, and we wouldn't be adding more but they can be amended if he has a dietary preference - one of our guests is a dairy free vegetarian and the stroganoff is being made vegan for them. He said he didn't like fish or mushrooms and thinks chicken is a bit plain for a wedding before settling on the chicken. A couple days later, he calls to change his mind and decides he will have the salmon. He then proceeded to jump between all 3 options a couple times, each time finding a reason to why he didn't want it (Salmon tastes too fishy, the chicken will be dry, stroganoff is too heavy for a wedding meal, etc). \n\nThis morning, I got a call from my caterer (who is his partner's brother), and he's contacted her asking if she can make him his own specific meal. He's asking for an expensive steak, vegetables, boiled potatoes and peppercorn sauce. I'll admit I kind saw red and called him annoyed that he tried to go around me and order what he wanted. The caterer laughed at him and told him that he had the options available and just to pick one. When I called him, I told him that he will be having the chicken and that if he doesn't like it then he can just go without as I won't have him calling the caterer to order something completely different. He wasn't happy when I told him, he argued I was being a bridezilla and that I needed to get off my high horse. His partner has also been in touch, constantly sending me messages about how I know that he needs to have 'proper' meat at every meal otherwise he's sick and that fish and chicken won't sustain him, and that 'it's just one steak, it's not like he's asking you to serve him a cow.' It's ridiculous, he can go without red meat for one meal, it won't kill him.\n\nAITA for suggesting that he gets what he is served or goes without?", "created_utc": 1669071878, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z1dbae/aita_for_telling_a_wedding_guest_that_he_can/", "score": 294, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He is a \"guesszilla\", if it is such a problem then he can have his steak... at home. Honestly, not sustain him, a wedding meal?!

Hundreds of people come from cultures where they are the primary meats. \n\nBut to try to go around your back to your caterer is beyond the pale. Absurd. And the fact your friend not only thinks its okay, but her special man should get his very special steak?\n\n\"Hi Jane and John,\n\nI am sorry to say that since we cannot accommodate your demand that John have a proper meat at the wedding dinner, we just can't include you anymore. We wish you both the best and are glad we can give you this news before you make definite travel plans, just as I now have to give the caterer definite head count numbers. Sincerely, A. Bride\"", "NTA. Uninvite them.", ">This morning, I got a call from my caterer (who is his partner's brother), and he's contacted her asking if she can make him his own specific meal.\n\nOkay,, everything before that, he was just obnoxious, but this would have got an uninvite from me. I'd have immediately contacted them both and said they are both banned, and security will be there to escort them out if they attempt to go in. This is well beyond the pale. Do NOT let them attend. \n\nYou're being too soft on this. get control over it now\n\nNTA", "NTA. I would have rescinded the plus one and told my friend she can come without him or not at all.", "NTA uninvite them both, you don\u2019t need this drama in the lead up to your wedding.", "NTA\n\nThis is absolutely absurd behavior. If it were me, that guest would be losing their plus one and he\u2019d be uninvited.\n\nYou have been shockingly accommodating for even speaking to him about this. He sounds horrid", "NTA - what a guestzilla. Maybe they don't need to go to the wedding if a simple meal request is too difficult for them.", "NTA", "NTA and my god the entitlement! Staggeringly self absorbed. Terrible etiquette too. Is it too late to uninvite him?", "NTA WTF", ">This morning, I got a call from my caterer (who is his partner's brother), and he's contacted her asking if she can make him his own specific meal.\nHe called the caterer?!?!? He's not even the main party invited, he's the plus one. Uninvited them, then they can eat real meat at home.", "NTA.", "NTA- don\u2019t invite either of them.", "NTA he's an absurd guest and I would uninvite him.", "NTA.  Never heard of a guestzilla before but here we are.  \n\nHonestly sounds like they should just be uninvited since they clearly won't enjoy the reception without a expensive steak anyways.", "Why haven't you invited him and his partner yet? Your friend should be utterly mortified and apologetic this guy was psycho enough to find out who your *caterer* is and then call to demand a special meal. She should be melting through the floor levels of embarrassed and contemplating dumping him.\n\nThat she is not means she may need to have her invite rescinded. \n\nDo talk with your caterer before you do so, considering they are family, but this is super psycho behavior.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Do yourself a favour and uninvite him at this point because this guy is going to be in your hair complaining about the food and going behind your back to the staff making special requests all night.", "I've never seen a *Guestzilla*!", "This.  No more need be said.", "The fries  will be his potato and the lettuce  his vegetable", "This is exactly what you do if you\u2019re a picky eater. A much-loved, much passed around family photo is of my uncle eating McDonald\u2019s at a family wedding (he did sort of try to hide it).", "I was so relieved to read the next few lines that the caterer laughed at him and said no. Yeesh.", "No, an ice flow, \"I'm not your friend, buddy!\"", "Lol, what's the chance they actually got them anything?", "A few years ago I went to this very swanky event with my husband at a yacht club - think ultra ritzy yacht club, not your normal yacht club, this was one for the high flyers in a very exclusive touristy area. They served a lot of very small portions of things like oysters or scallops. I know a lot of people love that, but a lot of people don't - me included. At one point I snuck off to check on the kids, who were being entertained in another part of the premise. The kids were being served pizza. They had boxes left over and I was offered a couple of slices so I happily accepted. On the way back to the hotel we saw tons of people dressed up to the 9s going into the fish and chip shop. They all looked a bit guilty about it. I will gladly admit to being unsophisticated, but give me a good slice of pizza over oysters any day.", "I'm not a picky eater, but my grandmother was a terrible cook with questionable food safety practices (she often shopped the expired goods at the feed store).\n\nLet's just say we all knew the Jack in the Box was just down the street, you either stopped on the way there or on the way home, any guests were given fair warning and no judgement from us.", "I would have rescinded the invite.", "You try that, I'll try the salmon.  Seriously, any of the three would make a good meal.", "\ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "But he\u2019s not their buddy, guy!", "$5 gift card to the worst steakhouse in town?", "I had the mushroom Swiss one and it was good. It was a long time ago.", "But he's not their guy, pal!", "\"Their not his guy, friend!\""]}
