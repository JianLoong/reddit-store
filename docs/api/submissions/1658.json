After my boyfriend told me how he feels I asked Tess if I could talk to her and sat her down and told her in the nicest if she cover up more when my boyfriend was around because it makes him uncomfortable and that she should have a little self-respect for her self and that there are some things you should know to do and stuff after that we got into an argument which led her to tell me if my boyfriend feels some type of way of a grown woman dressing he should stay at his house and that if he can't control his self which also led to me calling her a tramp and a few other horrible words after that.\n\nafter that night we haven't been on good terms or talked in a few days I have been staying over at my boyfriend's house after those days to give her some space after the heated argument, but AITA?", "created_utc": 1667783609, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yo8m1b/aita_for_asking_my_roommate_to_cover_up_because/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have a weird typo and I can\u2019t tell if you meant \u201conly a bra\u201d or \u201cno bra\u201d \n\nIf it\u2019s the latter, based on the rest of the post and you calling her a tramp, YTA still but if it\u2019s the former E S H", "YTA. Congratulations on making your roommate, the one who splits the bills with you, the one who has been there for 2 years, who actually lives there, uncomfortable because your boyfriend can't control his dick.", "YTA. That\u2019s her home and it\u2019s been her home for two years. He\u2019s been your boyfriend for three months. He has absolutely no authority to tell Tess how to dress in her own home. She\u2018s not walking around naked or in a thong. She does not by any means need to change how she dresses in her own home to accommodate a a new man in your life has wandering eyes.", "Yta so something that never bothered you before but bothers your BF is now suddenly a problem for you to solve? Honey,  the one who needs to get some self respect is you, not your roommate.", "YTA of course. You don't ask women to make men comfortable. You tell your bf to control himself and if he can't he should stay home. This whole thing stinks", "YTA", "YTA-people should be comfortable in their own home.  She shouldn't have to modify her behavior for a guest.", "YTA boyfriend is a probably a creep and can\u2019t control himself", "YTA", "YTA. I was expecting you to say she was walking around topless.", "I was leaning towards YTA until you started the you should know what to do bit and then proceeded to get ugly back at her. Look, it\u2019s a public living space. If it makes someone uncomfortable, just wear more clothing. However, everyone grows up differently and there is no right way to feel comfortable with how you are dressed at home. Some families literally all walk around nude like it\u2019s nothing. At the same time, you wouldn\u2019t do that when you have company either, at least not most people. Yta for saying she doesn\u2019t have self respect and calling her a tramp and whatever else you called her. You should apologize and start hanging out at your boyfriends place.", "Of course YTA. In what world do you tell your roommate to have some \"self-respect\", and call her a tramp, are you *not* the AH? She's clothed. It's not like she's waltzing around nude.", "You threw away a friendship of 2 years for a relationship of 3 months all because your boyfriend is sexualizing your friend in her own home?

Wtf is with the name calling?!! With a \u201cfriend\u201d like you who the hell needs an enemy. Btw if you\u2019re bf was uncomfortable with what Tess was wearing then he needs to stay the fuck at his own place!!!", "Wow. You trashed a 2-year friendship and successful roommate living for a 3-month boyfriend with control issues. Way to throw away your life for nothing.", "YTA. BF doesn\u2019t have to look if he doesn\u2019t like what she\u2019s wearing. He does have that much self-control, right?", "YTA\n\nYour boyfriend doesn\u2019t respect her. That doesn\u2019t mean she has no self-respect.\n\nYou had no right to say that to her. You owe her an apology and you owe yourself some educating.", "You're a major AH and your boyfriend is a creep. He is staring at your roommate and using her clothing choices as an excuse t of his creepy behavior. That's her home, not his, she can walk around naked for all she wants and you can't demand shit. The fact that you even had the balls to tell another female what to wear just speaks \"I'm insecure and know that my boyfriend has a wandering eye but it's my roommates fault\". You should move in with your boyfriend just understand this won't last, he'll have you wearing turtlenecks and long skirts before the end while he's messing with a girl he has told you makes him feel \"uncomfortable\". Lol.", "Literally could understand if she came out in no clothes or even panties and a top.  Then it would be a bit... eh.  Like okay ask she put SOMETHING on but you literally said she's in shorts and a top without a bra. If someone told me in my house that I had to keep my bra on for someone not paying rent I'd have thought you had me fucked up. YTA. You had no reason to handle it the way you did, and hopefully you get kicked and this roommate finds herself a new one", "YTA\u2026. For obvious reasons but tramp?! Who even uses that word as an insult in 2022?", "This is easy, YTA.", "I\u2019m not giving a judgement here but I want to say something to everyone in the comments. They boyfriend is not right to be looking at other people but you all have to realize that a man cannot control his penis.

Honestly, the timeline doesn't matter as much as the fact that *she* lives there and *he* doesn't.  He has no say over what goes on there.\n\nSo, not only did you allow your boyfriend's opinion to intrude on your roommate's autonomy, when she (rightfully) called out that bullshit, you doubled down and insulted her.\n\nShe's right.  Your boyfriend can stay home, if it's a problem.  You wanna see him?  You go there.  Then he can avoid being \"uncomfortable\" around a grown woman, living in her own space as she sees fit.", "YTA. Go to his apartment instead of having Tess walk on eggshells in her own apartment.", "How the heck does he manage out in society? He sounds like someone I wouldn't trust around any other humans because apparently he miraculously is the only one not responsible for his actions!\n\nETA YTA, no question.  She is not responsible for dressing up for your guests. She pays RENT not to have to care about that. And lack of self respect? Naw, she has plenty: after all, she told you no.", "YTA. Tess lives there. Your boyfriend doesn't. He has no right to march into someone else's home and demand that they change their behavior.", "YTA.  If your boyfriend is uncomfortable, he should leave.  He has no right to demand she make herself uncomfortable in her home to appease him.  He sounds like a jerk.", "1000% YTA. It\u2019s her home\u2026she can dress how she wants, and the comments you made about her having \u201cself respect\u201d were super douchy, unnecessary and just all over shitty. \n\nDid I mention YTA? Because wow do you need to apologize to your roommate\u2026", "yta 100%. you (and your boyfriend) have 0 right to be telling your roommate how to dress in HER home. if your boyfriend doesn\u2019t like it, he needs to find another fix because she should not have to forfeit her comfort, in her safe space, for a grown man.", "Asking her to cover up a bit when bf around because hes uncomfortable, fine.\nTelling her to have self respect, not fine.

Can\u2019t figure out why you even have to ask based on what you wrote. 1) it\u2019s her home, she can wear what she wants 2) if you really had to say something to her you should\u2019ve stopped at bf is uncomfortable but you went way further than that and way over the line questioning her self respect 3) then you name called\n\nYou and your bf are AHs.

When he cheats on you - and he will - remember this moment.  He's told you he can't control himself and it's the job of women to reduce temptation.  It's not his job to keep his mind off sex.  And you lost a friendship over this man?  \n\nGirl.  YTA, and you're kind of a disappointment to women.  Pick a side.", "YTA 100% a man who is a guest in HER home (since I\u2019m assuming she pays rent) has ZERO right to dictate what she\u2019s wears.

It\u2019s the fashion rn to have women wear what they want and it\u2019s a man\u2019s penis fault if he can\u2019t control it. This guy just saying I\u2019m uncomfortable to come to your house. Your actions calling her names sucks but her not hearing that a guest in her half shared home is uncomfortable regardless if she will do anything about it sucks.

Do you really wanna side with someone you\u2019ve only been with a matter of months, instead of your long term friend who you live with? \n\nIt\u2019s an unreasonable request for him to make. Everyone else was fine with it before he came along. If this is an issue for him now, you can be sure there will be many more down the road. Do you really think it will last with him? How many people are you going to ask to change their ways so he can be comfortable before you get fed up and leave him?\n\nYTA, especially for how you confronted her over it. That was 100% uncalled for and cruel. Probably too late to salvage your friendship with Tess, I bet you ruined your relationship with her. So I guess keep this advice in mind for the next time something like this comes up in your life.", "You just know this guy was walking around with a boner in high school typing \"boobies\" on his calculator thinking it was hilarious.", "My first thought when I opened the post, until o got to the end.\n\nSELF-RESPECT?! OP, sweetheart, you\u2019re the one disrespecting her. How could you even make it about her self respect?! Wow\n\nAnd your bf is not ready for humans if he can\u2019t handle seeing skin. He needs to reflect, not Tess.", "This has got to be a joke. Tess is in HER HOME and deserves to dress however she wants to be comfortable. Your BF is a visitor and he gets NO SAY! WTF.

Its the first thing I do when I get off of work. Ain't no one gonna tell me I have to wear a bra at home!!!", ">And if your bf had the issue, he should be the one to say something.\n\nI disagree with this part. He was right to only bring it up with his girlfriend, as he doesn't actually get a say in the household. From there, it was up to OP to say something to the roommate or tell him to drop it. \n\nIf OP is also uncomfortable with how the roommate dresses, though, she should have left the boyfriend out of it. She could have said, \"Hey, I've been feeling uncomfortable with your outfits and wanted to see if you would be open to covering up a bit more in common areas.\" (If roommate said no to that, then that's the end of her part of the discussion and it's now up to OP and boyfriend to figure out if they can drop it completely, if they should hang out exclusively at boyfriend's place, if OP should move out, etc.) \n\nI do agree that the \"self-respect\" comment was wayyy out of line, and that alone would make OP TA.
