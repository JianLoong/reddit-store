But this year we were going to my grandparents\u2019 place and there would be lots of family there so I thought it would be easier to just avoid my brother and there would be more people who might be annoyed at my brother if he decided to be a jerk so he might not.\n\nBut like every time my brother decided to get drunk and make fun of me for my weight. He has this \u201cjoke\u201d where he pulls food away from me at dinner when I\u2019m about to take some and he says I don\u2019t need it because I\u2019m fat, or says I should go jog a lap around the house to earn it. He did it multiple times and every time I told him he needed to stop acting like a jerk. Like always my parents ignored him, but so did everyone else except my uncle who laughed at me with my brother. I told my uncle to stop laughing because it encourages him but he didn\u2019t.\n\nI ended up leaving halfway through dinner and taking all the presents I\u2019d brought with me.

He backhands you.\n\nA slap was a great insult, but a backhanded slap was far more demeaning. In the Bava Kamma Mishnah (the traditional Jewish interpretation of the law), a slap incurred a fine of 200 silver coins \u2013 but a backhanded slap required a payment of 400, the same amount as for spitting on someone. It was more than violence. It was degrading. It was what you gave to an inferior or a slave.\n\nImagine you\u2019re a low class slave in the ancient Roman world. You are powerless. You are marginalized. Your life is not your own. To try to run away would be a death sentence.\n\nThen, one day, like so many other days, your master backhands you. He expects you to cower and whimper and slink off back to your duties. Maybe he expects you to get on your knees and beg forgiveness. But instead, you look him in the eyes and turn your head to put your left cheek forward. You\u2019ve already insulted him by failing to break down, so he has the right (in his mind) to slap you again.\n\nBut he can\u2019t slap you with his left hand, because that is unclean for both of you. And he can\u2019t backhand, because your right cheek is away from him. To strike again, his only option is to slap you with the palm of his hand. And this was not the way to slap a slave. This was reserved for equals. If he chooses to slap you again, he is forced to upgrade your status. He has to bump you up to a higher class citizen in order to get his revenge.\n\nThis \u201cvictory\u201d may seem small, but it isn\u2019t. You have asserted your humanity and reminded the master you are not an object to be owned and controlled. To reiterate what I wrote about the extra mile, the offer of the other cheek was actually a way to unmask the power play, to non-violently subvert the system by playing right into the ridiculousness of it all", "\"Like there's evil, and then there's just being a dick.

Also, it's weird how your brother is SO obsessed about your food issues (even if you have issues), while his evident alcohol problem is FINE. Is anyone pulling the bottle or glass away from his drunk ass ever time he takes another drink? Maybe next Christmas should be an intervention about his drinking.   \nYou did the right thing. Feel free to leave toxic people behind - and these ARE toxic people. They'd rather see you suffer and be treated badly by a drunk bully than do the right thing - \"to keep the peace\". WHAT PEACE?  \n\n\nI've experienced this exact behaviour with my own blood family, and it doesn't change. Don't rationalize it. Don't excuse it. Don't dismiss your own feelings later, out of guilt. Have boundaries. Be prepared to go NC or LC. You can explain why (or not - at this point it's pretty self evident). They won't care until it impacts them - which it will. Once the chosen victim is gone, the bully doesn't just decide to reform - no, he'll find ANOTHER target in the family.   \n\n\nSomething not dissimilar happened to me, as I mentioned - twice, actually. The first time, it was a cousin of mine with a drug \"problem\". The only time he'd ever show his face was at Christmas. He'd show up late, bring a druggy friend or two, ignore his kid unless to use him as a weapon against his ex, be rude to everyone, stuff his face (and his pockets) and then leave as early as he could. The last time, he stole his boy's Christmas present to sell for drugs - my mother actually went around to the local pawn shops to get it back, which she did. After this, I said I would not be coming to Christmas in future if he was allowed. I didn't want to watch my nephew being emotionally abused and stolen from by his own father, and having his Christmas ruined, as well as that of his mother.   \n\n\nMY mother had a huge, ongoing hissy fit about it. For like two years. You can't tell me who to have in my house, this isn't your decision to make, why can't you just keep the peace....she really brought out the whole list. I didn't care. I said, it's YOUR decision who you invite or permit in your house - and it's MY decision where I go and when, and who I'll be around. I said I'd go for NYE or something, but that I was done watching my cousin destroy himself and his kid. My cousin worked on everyone during all this, guilting them in to trying to guilt me - I didn't care, because - like you - I'm not trying to force you to do anything. I'm setting up boundaries about what is ok with ME, and trying to force me in to a scenario is not ok.  \n\n\nTwo years later the cousin started a \"new job\" which required steel toed boots. My mother went and bought them for him, got him a bunch of warm work clothes and a BIG box of home made baking, and then went to some flop house to drop it off for him - where he BERATED HER for not bringing enough. She finally snapped and from then on he was \"uninvited\" to family gatherings - but it had to be about HER before she acted. I'm her only child and even me removing myself from Christmas didn't do it - no, SHE had to be abused by him directly, after she (ridiculously) bent over backwards for the love and approval of someone who'd sell her for drugs.  \n\n\nI'd like to say she learned her lesson. She hasn't. A similar situation arose not long ago, and again I removed myself (I won't bore you with the details). Let me just say that if I go somewhere as a guest, am there to do a favour, and am them randomly and pointlessly insulted by my \"host\", I don't ever go again. Like you, I just got up and left. Well, this made the ongoing relationship my mother has with these people awkward FOR HER, so of course my LEAVING was the issue, not the behaviour I encountered.  \n\n\nWhat did I learn that might be helpful? 1. People don't change until they have to change. 2. People are so terrified of confrontation or being bullied themselves that they'll GLADLY watch you get torn apart and keep silent. 3. Those people are not \"family\". They're just people you're genetically related to - and that doesn't count for much. Think of all the second and third cousins and so on that you have, that you don't know and will never even meet. They're \"family\".  \n\n\nMake your own family of choice, and weed that garden too.", "fuck those selfish shallow people. \n\nand they get to return/keep the ones for you anyways, seems win win, since that's all that matters.", "I cant believe they said you punished them \u201cfor no reason.\u201d As if you being harassed doesn\u2019t matter to them at all.

My dad yelled at my sister, my brother yelled at my dad (we are not a yelling family so it was a lot). After 24 hr or so my dad called and asked me sternly to come home.

They listen to you when you have problems and always have your back.\n\nSometimes those two types of families are the same people, and sometimes they are different.\nDo not be fooled by the illusion of obligation, that you have an obligation to be with your blood relatives who treat you like crap over friends or other relatives that respect you for who you are.", "NTA--Tell them they are all spineless cowards. Your brother is a bully and it is a shame that family enables him.", "NTA. Your brother and uncle and the rest of the lot ruined YOUR Christmas.", "Please pass this quote onto your family:\n\n\"Thou shalt not be a perpetrator, thou shalt not be a victim, but thou shalt never, not ever be a bystander.\"\n\nAnd for your family that did nothing:\n\"First they came for the Communists\nAnd I did not speak out\nBecause I was not a Communist\nThen they came for the Socialists\nAnd I did not speak out\nBecause I was not a Socialist\nThen they came for the trade unionists\nAnd I did not speak out\nBecause I was not a trade unionist\nThen they came for the Jews\nAnd I did not speak out\nBecause I was not a Jew\nThen they came for me\nAnd there was no one left\nTo speak out for me\"\n\n\nThis is abuse and bullying from your family.  You are doing the right thing by walking away.  Your family need to learn to shut down your brother's antics.  If your brother is willing to bully you, he can easily flip a switch on your cousins.\n\nOP, you are not at fault.  The only reason they had a good time was at YOUR expense.  Stand your ground.", "NTA- your family was only upset about the presents, not that you left. That is so sad. I would go no contact", "Wow.  So, what your family said to you was \u201cwe don\u2019t care how someone treats you, just leave the presents at the door.\u201d   No way you \u201cruined or brought down\u201d their Christmas. Your brother needs to grow up.", "NTA\n\nknowing but not say anything to hinder him being the jerk he is made the \"partners in crime\" they are as guilty as if they were saying it. the uncle that laughed about it was a jerk but he was honest about what he thought. he is from the same  bad side of genepool as your brother.\n\nthe rest of your family were not just innocent bystanders if christmas was ruined it's not you but them that ruined it. \n\nyou did the right thing by walking away, I think i would have pulled the turkey over his head and stomp him in the nose.", "NTA - you are not obligated to stay anywhere that you are made to feel uncomfortable. I also walked out of Christmas with my parents. Dad made me cry then yelled at me for crying. Just because they\u2019re family doesn\u2019t mean you have to put up with their S**t.", "Nta.  Tell them that you will keep it up until they put jerk bro in his place.", "NTA. I also have a family member who often gets drunk. They were formally rebuked by a family member over this and I haven't seen them drunk at a family event ever since. This was the most chill holiday season we've ever had. Practically a Hallmark commercial.\n\nPeople behave the way you allow them to behave.", ">Even though a few of them agreed my brother was being a jerk, they said they didn\u2019t do anything wrong and I punished them for no reason.\n\nCorrect. They did nothing. Nada. Zip. Zero. Zilch. They sat there and let your brother and uncle disrespect you, and did nothing to stop it.\n\nSend a group text saying that you \"apologize\" for not wanting to be treated like crap on Christmas, and that if the lack of presents upsets them more than your getting mistreated, then maybe they should see a specialist about it.\n\nNTA. And Merry belated Christmas.", "NTA!!! You absolutely did the right thing by making your boundaries clear. Kudos to you for not just sitting there and taking it to keep the peace.  You\u2019re welcome to celebrate with my family next year!!!  You deserve to be surrounded by people who respect you!", "NTA - your family are wrong by not doing anything to stop your brother they were doing something wrong.    \nI would never let someone treat another like that family member or not", "NTA.  They are all enabling your brothers childish behavior.  Your parents clearly failed to raise a gentleman.  Your uncles should be ashamed of themselves for laughing at your brothers jokes.  That they called your actions childish is unbelievable.  Your brother and uncles sound like the childish ones.", "Your family didn't care about you leaving and not being there, they were only upset becuase you took the presents you brought with you.  That shows how much your family cares about you.  NTA", "NTA. So they want the shit you can give them but don\u2019t want to actually treat you like a family member? They can\u2019t have it both ways. \n\nHonestly OP, I kinda hope you drop them. They sound like shit.", "NTA. You can come to Christmas with us next year! No one is allowed to comment on how much/little anyone eats and we graze throughout the day, play games, and we have a \u201cclean but ugly\u201d rule (comfy clothes, no makeup). No gifts are necessary but if so we have a $20 cap, no exceptions!", "Your brother is encouraging and enforcing a fucking eating disorder on you at family holiday dinners, and you\u2019re being childish for not wanting to endure that???? NTA. NTA about the gifts either, anyone who stuck up for me or checked him would have gotten their gift.", "NTA\nAh yes, the old \"We didn't do anything to help or hinder, so we didn't do anything wrong!\" defense.\nBy standing by and letting him continue, they pretty much gave their tacit approval of his actions. It's why he kept going. I'd suggest going LC with your extended family, and NC with your direct family and the uncle who laughed.", "While I agree leaving quietly was the right call, OP could have flipped a table and I would still have a hard time calling them an AH. It sounds like this is absolutely an ongoing issue that hasn't been addressed and has only gotten worse. NTA.", "Ugh, it took only until recently for my mother to try to break this dynamic. I was always teased for eating more than everyone else and my siblings and father would always comment on how much I was putting on my plate. Sure, I was overweight, but honestly not by that much, and their teasing made me amplify the criticism internally. Any attempts I'd make to defend myself were met with being told that \"Guys shouldn't care.\"\n\nMy mom never engaged in the teasing, would roll her eyes at the others, and occasionally said something to defend me, but it wasn't until I confided in her that I was bulimic in college and had developed body dysmorphia that she finally started being more proactive in her supporting me. While my dad occasionally slips, having someone in my corner helped cut down the comments immensely- I only wish she had interjected more substantially earlier.", "Agree.  Your family stood by silent while some drunk harrassed you, prevented you from enjoying your meal and was ruining your Christmas.  If you should attend another family function, I would make it contingent upon your brother being seated far away from you so he cannot pull food away from you.", ">\u201cYour family was more upset by losing your presents than caring for your presence.\u201d\n\nAnd, OP, THAT is what you respond with to every single family member. If they fire back with anything simply put.\n\n\"Families come in all sorts of packaging, kind of like gifts... you guys gave me an INCREDIBLY gift this year -- one I will remember for a very long time. The gift of seeing all of you for who you truly are. Cowards afraid to stand up to the family bully.

It\u2019s wonderful.", "NTA. But please tell them that they gave you the greatest gift of all. Finally knowing that they are all AHs. Tell them that you gave their gifts to Goodwill. If they hurry, they might find them. But doubt it because you have amazing ones.", "NTA Not taking a side is essentially siding with the bully. Worse, your family was letting you be the target because they know it would be one of them otherwise. You handled it in an exceptionally mature and calm way, so you've got nothing to feel bad about. Return those gifts if you can and treat yourself to something that makes you happy.", "NTA I have a brother like this, everyone one was keeping their heads down because they did not want to become a target of your brother and they are mad at you because you solo purpose for them is to be his punching bag and by walking out it took that away and highlighted their own failings.\nI have been no contact with my brother for over 8.5 years now and it was the best decision of my life.", "NTA.  Find your people, OP cause it ain't this lot.  Eff them, they're selfish pricks.   They're saying you ruined Christmas by not being the butt of their rude, lame jokes and by not buying them things.  They're toxic and you're better off without people like that.", "NTA. I\u2019d have punched him. You\u2019re a better person than I am. And the rest of your family are aholes too for not saying anything.", "NTA. You nailed it all directly on the head. Your points are exactly correct and valid.  No point in repeating what you already know, so I won\u2019t. But the point is, they wouldn\u2019t have had  \u201cthe whole mood brought down\u201d if they hadn\u2019t all acted like first prize assholes. They know it was wrong. But instead of holding your brother, and themselves accountable for their actions they play victims. They deserved to have the whole mood brought down as a consequence to their actions. One can\u2019t act like a shitty human being and then expect to be gifted and praised for it. \n\nI\u2019d drop every single one of them and remove the toxicity from your life. They have had years to change and haven\u2019t. They proved they won\u2019t now. It\u2019s all about their own selfishness.", "NTA. Respond to everyone with a copy and paste of the same response someone else suggested. They're mad because you held a boundary and they didn't get gifts they knew they'd love because they know you put thought into them.", "NTA. I would just cut contact with all of them.", "NTA\n\nMay as well get it out of the way saying this: They fucked around and found out. \n\nTime to go LC or NC with everyone that took part or enabled that crap. You don\u2019t need them and they certainly couldn\u2019t attempt to care about you", "Fear that they will be the next target or that \"they will have ruined Christmas\" for defending.", "This.  If you see a bully picking a fight and you don't take a side,  you are taking a side."]}
