But this year we were going to my grandparents\u2019 place and there would be lots of family there so I thought it would be easier to just avoid my brother and there would be more people who might be annoyed at my brother if he decided to be a jerk so he might not.\n\nBut like every time my brother decided to get drunk and make fun of me for my weight. He has this \u201cjoke\u201d where he pulls food away from me at dinner when I\u2019m about to take some and he says I don\u2019t need it because I\u2019m fat, or says I should go jog a lap around the house to earn it. He did it multiple times and every time I told him he needed to stop acting like a jerk. Like always my parents ignored him, but so did everyone else except my uncle who laughed at me with my brother. I told my uncle to stop laughing because it encourages him but he didn\u2019t.\n\nI ended up leaving halfway through dinner and taking all the presents I\u2019d brought with me. I didn\u2019t make a fuss, I just picked up my bags and left because we hadn\u2019t done presents yet and they were all still together in my bags. Later multiple family members told me I was being childish and trying to ruin Christmas for everyone by walking out and taking the presents. They said I brought the whole mood down for the rest of the night and everyone had a bad time because of me.\n\nEven though a few of them agreed my brother was being a jerk, they said they didn\u2019t do anything wrong and I punished them for no reason. I think that sitting around and not saying anything when he was making fun of me was wrong and I feel like if they weren\u2019t even willing to say a single thing against him or standing up for me they don\u2019t deserve to get gifts from me.

The fact that you left quietly shows a level of class and respect that your family seems to lack.  I hope you find others to spend the holidays with who actually understand the meaning of holiday spirit.  Find some happiness and don't let them guilt you about it.  Blood relative doesn't mean you need to absorb abuse.", "NTA. This is a pretty typical (and assbackwards) family dynamic. Everyone agrees that the bully (or abuser) is wrong, but they also agree that the victim should just keep quiet to keep the peace. \n\nYou brilliantly asserted your boundaries without making a scene. You didn't ruin Christmas -- they did by expecting one innocent person to suffer just because no one wants to stand up to the bully. \n\nThey ruined Christmas for themselves. They're just mad because deep down they do know that they're wrong for staying quiet, and you being so reasonable just makes them look extra bad. \n\nGood job, OP. hugs", "NTA.

They sat there and let it happen, kept their mouths shut while you were being bullied. I'm glad you \"brought the whole mood down,\" maybe they'll learn something about sticking up for you when your asshole brother starts up. BTW, he sounds like an alcoholic. Next time he digs at you, say, \"Tell you what. I'll join Weight Watchers when you join Alcoholics Anonymous. You really have a problem.\" \n\nNTA. But your family is.... especially your parents for letting this go on so long!", "NTA. Good for you for standing up for yourself. Hope you got the receipts for the presents you bought them. Go return them and get yourself something nice. Happy New Year!", "NTA. I would tell them all until they can show respect, they get nothing. Go no contact or low contact for a while.", "NTA. Bullying disguised as \u201cjokes\u201d is still bullying and unacceptable behavior. You should not have to tolerate it.", "NTA.

They don\u2019t deserve to be around you.", "NTA, I\u2019d go low to no contact for a while. Where was all this noise when you were being disrespected in front of everybody? It seems it only got personal when they realized they were getting no presents from you.", "NTA.  Not one of them spoke up for you, so not one of them deserved your presence or your presents.", "NTA. It wasn't that you punished them for no reason. The reason is none of them stood up for you that time, or it seems, ever. You didn't make a scene, so you didn't ruin anything. They did, particularly your entitled AH brother.\n\nI would go a step further and say that you will avoid further family events if your brother continues to act like a brat. When they hem and haw, ignore it and repeat the point: you aren't going to go out of your way to be teased and mocked, and be around people who find that behavior acceptable.", "NTA -\n\n Every person there who did nothing or didn't say anything was enabling your brother to bully you.  Their silence indicated approval/acceptance of his behavior  - at least that is how it appeared.  Shame on your parents for never stepping in and allowing him to get away with his bullying & behavior towards you...that tells me that either he is their favorite or they are embarrassed by your weight and kinda agree with him. I say this as a person who had a parent who was embarrassed by my weight most of my life (and that's a whole other story! lol)  I am so very sorry you were treated this way by your family. I agree, they were in a snit because you left (which should have made every single one of them embarrassed and ashamed of themselves and upset at your brother) but instead decided you 'can't take a joke'. \n\nIsn't it funny that the person who is making fun of us, or being cruel is never taken to task - but if we react then somehow WE are the problem child, being difficult etc?  Don't listen to them, time to go LC or NC with this bunch of inconsiderate ah's and not let them make fun of you or hurt you anymore.   You are worth more than how they treat you. \n\nTake care.", "NTA, I have a brother that behaves in a similar way when he gets drunk. Others not saying anything is the same as accepting it as far as I am concerned.\n\nI actually had a plan for how to deal with it this year, but we ended up leaving before he became arsehole drunk this year.\n\nSetting healthy boundaries for what you are willing to accept and actively enforcing them is IMO never the arsehole move.", "NTA but you're surrounded by them", "NTA  You calmly removed yourself from a horrible situation.", "NTA\n\nHow exactly did you punish them? It\u2019s not like you took the presents with your name on the tag as well.\n\nI think it\u2019s amazing you removed yourself from the situation instead of snapping or calling them out.

Your family not defending you makes them AHs.  Why should you reward that behavior by giving them gifts.  NTA.", "NTA. I'm sorry you had to deal with that on Christmas.", "NTA-Your family should stand behind you and address the brother. The fact they didn\u2019t speak volumes. You were right to leave and take your things with you. No one there should have been expecting you to put up with the abuse your brother intentionally inflicted. He does it because he knows no one will speak up and that is just horrible.", "NTA Why would you get presents for bullies or enablers? You would only be TA and only to yourself if you keep putting yourself in these situations. Spend your time with better people.", "NTA. You get no support, and on the off chance you ever decide to go again, don\u2019t bring one gift with you.

It's really sad that you leaving because you were miserable bothers them, and not the behaviour of the person making you miserable.", "NTA.

It was extreme taking the presents back but good for you and you're doing that makes me laugh.\n\nYour relatives are bitching at you because they did not and would not stop enabling your brother and your leaving shamed them and that is on them.

So sibling repeatedly gets away with screaming at me and cursing me out, and my parents blame me for \"provoking\" them. Just because we were born into families that treat us like crap, that doesn't mean that we have to keep spending time with them. You had every right to walk out and take your gifts with you.
