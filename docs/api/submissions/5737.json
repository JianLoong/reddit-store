But this year we were going to my grandparents\u2019 place and there would be lots of family there so I thought it would be easier to just avoid my brother and there would be more people who might be annoyed at my brother if he decided to be a jerk so he might not.\n\nBut like every time my brother decided to get drunk and make fun of me for my weight. He has this \u201cjoke\u201d where he pulls food away from me at dinner when I\u2019m about to take some and he says I don\u2019t need it because I\u2019m fat, or says I should go jog a lap around the house to earn it. He did it multiple times and every time I told him he needed to stop acting like a jerk. Like always my parents ignored him, but so did everyone else except my uncle who laughed at me with my brother. I told my uncle to stop laughing because it encourages him but he didn\u2019t.\n\nI ended up leaving halfway through dinner and taking all the presents I\u2019d brought with me. I didn\u2019t make a fuss, I just picked up my bags and left because we hadn\u2019t done presents yet and they were all still together in my bags.

They said I brought the whole mood down for the rest of the night and everyone had a bad time because of me.\n\nEven though a few of them agreed my brother was being a jerk, they said they didn\u2019t do anything wrong and I punished them for no reason. I think that sitting around and not saying anything when he was making fun of me was wrong and I feel like if they weren\u2019t even willing to say a single thing against him or standing up for me they don\u2019t deserve to get gifts from me.

I agree, they were in a snit because you left (which should have made every single one of them embarrassed and ashamed of themselves and upset at your brother) but instead decided you 'can't take a joke'. \n\nIsn't it funny that the person who is making fun of us, or being cruel is never taken to task - but if we react then somehow WE are the problem child, being difficult etc?

My advice would be to stand your ground. If someone takes a low blow, throw one right back at em. The comment will still sting, but in my experience it\u2019s the best deterrent.  Don\u2019t let someone else control you with their ignorance.  Much love cousin.", "NTA and I\u2019d flat out tell them that letting your brother harass you and laugh at you without saying anything was wrong. Letting someone you care about be treated that way is wrong and you leaving was the consequence of everyone\u2019s actions or lack of actions. I\u2019d tell them if they want you there they should act like it and act like you matter instead of letting you be shit on.", "Exactly. This is what I came here to say.", "That would have been my response, If nobody else is going to stand up for you doing it yourself would not have made you TA. It might have actually soured the celebration, but it certainly would have driven home the point (sorry).", "Or OP can just not buy their family members anything moving forward since they do not have their back.", "I do not handle people messing with my plate or food well at all.", "That\u2019s definitely an option.  It does suck that nobody in their family has the guts to speak up, but it seems like OP does want a relationship with them.  I think standing up to their brother themself is the best way to achieve that.  Turning the other cheek rarely works in my experience with bullies."]}
