But this year we were going to my grandparents\u2019 place and there would be lots of family there so I thought it would be easier to just avoid my brother and there would be more people who might be annoyed at my brother if he decided to be a jerk so he might not.\n\nBut like every time my brother decided to get drunk and make fun of me for my weight. He has this \u201cjoke\u201d where he pulls food away from me at dinner when I\u2019m about to take some and he says I don\u2019t need it because I\u2019m fat, or says I should go jog a lap around the house to earn it. He did it multiple times and every time I told him he needed to stop acting like a jerk. Like always my parents ignored him, but so did everyone else except my uncle who laughed at me with my brother. I told my uncle to stop laughing because it encourages him but he didn\u2019t.\n\nI ended up leaving halfway through dinner and taking all the presents I\u2019d brought with me. I didn\u2019t make a fuss, I just picked up my bags and left because we hadn\u2019t done presents yet and they were all still together in my bags.

I think that sitting around and not saying anything when he was making fun of me was wrong and I feel like if they weren\u2019t even willing to say a single thing against him or standing up for me they don\u2019t deserve to get gifts from me.

I agree, they were in a snit because you left (which should have made every single one of them embarrassed and ashamed of themselves and upset at your brother) but instead decided you 'can't take a joke'. \n\nIsn't it funny that the person who is making fun of us, or being cruel is never taken to task - but if we react then somehow WE are the problem child, being difficult etc?
