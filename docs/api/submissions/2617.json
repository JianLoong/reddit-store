I still live at home but pay rent every month and buy my own food, so it's not like I'm mooching off them. Anyways, my reason for locking my stuff up is my younger brother (17) won't stop stealing my stuff, and I had enough. The last thing stolen was a pair of my boots, and I got them back all damaged. I believe I should have been compensated by him for my boots and many other items that have been stolen ($700.00 impact, my other phone, a spare set of rims and tires) really nothing is safe around him. Instead of being compensated for my boots, my parents bought him a new pair so he wouldn't take mine. That was annoying itself because I was never bought anything like that unless it was Christmas or my birthday. It's not a big deal, but that annoyed me that he is rewarded for theft, and I'm still stuck with damaged boots. Boots that I bought myself. Today, when I got back from work and decided to turn on my Xbox to relax, it wouldn't work. After investigating, I found my hdmi port on the Xbox to be absolutely destroyed. It was working perfectly fine the night before and was broken when I got home from work. When I talked to my parents about it they told me that I can't prove it was him, and they are right, I don't have cameras filming my Xbox but I still believe he did it. Anyways, they act like I'm crazy for thinking he did that to my xbox and they say I'm over reacting for locking all of my belongings up.
