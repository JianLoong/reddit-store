Frankly, it kind of doesn't matter if your vegan or not, the question seems to be more how to extract yourself from a conversation politely. I don't think it's a problem that you zoned out the first time, but it's odd that once they brought you back into the conversation, you just \"shrugged and nodded and tried to focus on something else.\" However, imo taking about your favorite meats and insisting a vegan participate in the discussion when they don't want to seems like a mildly AH move to me. I think some ok alternate ways to handle it would have been: 1) straight up say that since you don't eat meat, you don't have a favorite meat and you'd rather just let them discuss amongst themselves and stay out of the conversation. 2) If pushed, that's a good time to simply excuse yourself to \"make a call\" and see if a break in the conversation would lead to new topics in a few minutes. 3) If you came back several minutes later and they were still talking meat, then maybe suggest a a slight shift in topic, like \"I still don't have a favorite meat, but I could talk about my favorite side dishes. I had a leak and mushroom strata the other day that practically blew my mind!...\" And 4) if they were *still* pushing, then that's when I'd say to myself, ok, I have done my best, they are making their own way into AH territory and I'd just excuse myself from the convo entirely.", "Ive ate meat my whole life along with my entire family and the closest we have ever come to a discussion about our favorite meat is the following:\n\n\"Do you want chicken or hamburgers for dinner?\"\n\nNta op but your friends are extremely weird.", "NTA- I don\u2019t typically talk with friends about meat in general, but I sure AF wouldn\u2019t do it if one of my vegan friends were there.

You could have excused yourself during the conversation that made you uncomfortable.

When eating habits (especially mine) come up, I just like to ask a different question. \u201cI prefer to talk about something more fun than lunch. What books are you reading/TV shows are you watching/Podcasts are listening to/Bonkers facts have you learned recently?\u201d Or I just ask an off the wall question that dovetails with their convo.

I live in pork country and rarely have conversations regarding meat unless we discussing what we should have for dinner.   NTA but odd conversation. OP I would say if you were uncomfortable with the conversation instead of staring blankly I would have excused myself to go to the bathroom or to get a drink.", "Same, as me then to get mad when someone doesn't want to answer? What a strange lot of people. \n\nI have alpha gal. I miss beef and pork. The only time I would bring up preference would be to mention my allergy so there can hopefully be chicken. That or I can just bring my own dish. \n\nBeing grilled a favorite meat is just....odd.", "Ah I feel like they would've been more insulted if I made the conversation about my feelings though. Would you prefer that if you were in that situation? It might have been more honest but I think for most it would only be more annoying. \n\nI'm not really comfortable discussing the things I used to eat unfortunately. And I didn't think about turning the conversation but that would've been a better idea probably, I'm autistic so it doesn't come too easily to me. I do appreciate that they were trying to talk to me though. I don't think they were trying to provoke me as some other comments are saying. I wish they would've been more mindful of the topic though.", "I don't talk about veganism to them a lot though which is one of the reasons I was surprised at their reaction. I'm aware it's not something everyone agrees with. I talk about it if I am asked \u2014 the most I do is vent about my feelings on my personal accounts (not to them directly) or get \"special\" meals at social events which I guess can be annoying but I don't really have any other options.", "I didn't which actually might have been part of the issue. I have a very neutral face but I'd assume they're used to it. I tried to smile the same way I always smile. I don't think talking about my feelings would have had a better reaction?", "This would be a low stakes story to make up also how is op dumb", "I did just listen though, or is zoning out like a very specific action? I apologize if that isn't the right expression. I'm not comfortable with those conversations because I don't think they're harmless and I was trying to distract myself. Is that disrespectful?", "I don't think it's passive aggressive to zone out. It's not passive aggressive to be bored.", "What is so wrong about zoning out when the conversation turns boring?", "I think they would have reacted the same way if I just left... I obviously can't say for sure\n\nI don't think my lack of attention was because of anything I had against my friends \u2014 can you explain why it seemed that way? I feel I was just uncomfortable with the topic because it's something I feel strongly about. It wasn't about not hearing others as much as it was about not hearing things that were upsetting to me. I understand from your comment that you don't like my ideologies though so we don't have to discuss that", "I'm a poor person in a third world country. I don't see why you feel the need to make these comments. I'm not here to debate anyone.", "18 and 19", "Do you have a resting haughty face or something? That's the only solution I can think of to why they would find you not participating to be \"acting superior\"", "You are NTA. These people don\u2019t sound like your friends.", "I've posted this 1000 times before. People are rude to vegans because everyone knows its kind of messed up to eat meat. (like you wouldn't eat a dog but you would eat a cow). Most people don't have the chutzpah to slaughter an animal themselves. \n\nWhen you mention you are vegan. it forces them to address the cognitive dissidence with eating meat, which they hate, so they try to turn the conversation on you.  Most the time, its via being accused of being \"pushy\" when you share facts about the food you eat and the ethical reason to do so. In this case, they wanted you to identify your favorite former meat so they could attack you for not being a \"pure vegan\" and feel better about their own choices.", "OP did explain, but they kept pushing it", "In the sense that you're deliberately trying to involve someone in conversations about things they do not want to talk about, yes.", "Feels like you intentionally missed the point of the comment.", "I don\u2019t give a shit about veganism, but it\u2019s obvious that the poster meant that it was not very inclusive to make a big deal about a conversation in which you know someone doesn\u2019t want to participate.", "Not directly, but yeah, why not. They didn\u2019t say eating meat is the same as being an alcoholic, not all comparisons are meant to be 1-1", "I\u2019d say be up front with them? They\u2019re your friends, there\u2019s no reason not to share feelings, especially when asked. If they ask you what your fave meat was before you went vegan, tell them that that the question makes you uncomfortable and you don\u2019t really have an answer. If they get upset with you about that, that\u2019s on them, not you.", "But what were your answers? In your post you make it sound like you refused to say anything at all.", "I would prefer you to name what is your actual favorite dish and say why it\u2019s your favorite. It\u2019s ok to steer a conversation a bit. Zoning out is really rude. Or state it makes you uncomfortable and bring up the food you do like or something else that\u2019s happened recently/new show/movie, being up just about anything in the news.", "It is discourteous.  you're actually conversing with people in the same room; it's not Fakebook with a bunch of \"friends\" you've never met.\n\nExcuse yourself if you don't like the topic of conversation.", "> it was about not hearing things that were upsetting to me. \n\nExcuse yourself from the conversation.  Go to the bathroom. Have a cigarette.  Check the weather outside.\n\nIf you can't handle a conversations that might upset you, you need to evaluate why.", "Your a poor person in a third world country with the internet and a computer, and able to to buy certain foods all year round that aren't locally sourced to satisfy the b vitamin requirements you would normally get from meat ....?\nAre you sure you know what third world means", "I get it what the OP is saying.  I've literally been called \"stuck up\" for  NOT saying anything before and keeping to myself when uncomfortable with the work lounge discussion (Literally called \"Little Ms. Stuck UP\").  People are ridiculous.", "Yeah after they just stood their saying nothing", "There's always at least one of those.", "\"Yeah\" \"I'm not sure\" and things like that", "Can you give me an example of how you would change the conversation like that? If you don't mind. They were asking what my favorite animal to eat was before. I'm not sure how to answer without being rude.", "I feel like it's more acceptable to \"zone out\" and keep to yourself when uninterested in a conversation than make an announcement and entirely the leave the room. \n\nDifferent strokes for different folks I guess.", "I can handle an upsetting conversation, but I don't think not wanting to listen to my friends casually talk about something I feel strongly about is a character flaw? It is sincerely hurtful to me and something very important to my identity and my values. That's not their problem though which is why I didn't want to participate in the conversation. Was not physically leaving a mistake?", "Do... you know what third world means? Or that poor people can have phones? I am in a very agricultural south american country. Most of the food I eat is locally sourced, from agroecological farmers, friends and my own garden. I take one b12 supplement. I don't understand the point of making these assumptions.", "Sheesh. I was only going read (and upvote since so many were saying what I was going to anyway). But no one needs a \u201ccomputer\u201d anymore when they have phones? And mine happens to be still hanging in there for over 10 years (now I hope I haven\u2019t jinxed myself & it will crash tomorrow). And though I\u2019m not vegan we were poor as dirt when I was a kid, only ate meat when we got it canned from the commodities truck or someone in the extended family went hunting. Both instances RARE. My grandma & mom knew how to cook & cook healthy. As far as I am aware the only place this is impossible are in far northern climates.  In the 70s the Canadian government tried to put an indigenous population, who had previously been on a high fat meat diet, on a mainly fish  & vegetable diet. They became extremely ill.", "It not rude to say you don\u2019t eat meat/that question makes me uncomfortable and to redirect the conversation to something you\u2019re comfortable commenting on. Such as a vegan restaurant you really enjoy if you want to stay on food. You can direct the conversation to other topics too. \u201cI\u2019d rather not. Did you see how many TS fans registered to vote!\u201d Or whatever else is currently happening in the news.\n\nYou just don\u2019t want to do the typical BS of calling them murders, mouths graveyards etc."]}
