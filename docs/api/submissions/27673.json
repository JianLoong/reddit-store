{"id": 27673, "submission_id": "16susj3", "title": "AITA for being rude about my veganism?", "selftext": "I think this might be a minor issue but I am severely socially anxious and the guilt is haunting me \ud83d\udc4e I didn't want to post this on a vegan sub because I think the answer there would be obvious. I know most people here are not vegan and I want to know what is objectively annoying for the sake of maintaining healthy human relationships. \n\nBasically I am vegan. I have been for a long time, everyone around me knows etc. I have strong opinions but I don't talk about it a lot because I don't want to be annoying and I try to be nice when people ask about it because I feel that is the most productive thing I can do. I try to just mind my own business but ultimately this is something that is important to me and my friends know that. \n\nI was talking to some of my friends today, eventually food comes up, eventually meat comes up. They were discussing their favorite types of meat and all that stuff, which is fine, but not a conversation I want to be part of. Obviously I was uncomfortable and zoned out a little. I understand suddenly going quiet and looking uninterested is not the nicest way to act but I'm not sure what else I could have done. \n\nThey saw I wasn't participating and started asking questions to me, like what my favorite type of meat was before I went vegan or just saying things to me directly, like, looking at me in the eyes. I was very uncomfortable at this point but I still did not want to be rude so I just shrugged and nodded and tried to focus on something else.\n\nEventually they get mad. Like Mad mad. Saying I'm so annoying for acting superior when they talk about these things or being rude and not answering their questions, accusing me of feeling x way. I had no idea what to do and I just explained that I was uncomfortable talking about this and they should probably be aware of that. I don't think I said anything mean to them in the entire conversation, I just wasn't participating \u2014 they can talk about whatever they want, but I didn't know why they wanted to involve me in it when they know how I feel about it. I still don't know what they wanted me to do... like they expected me to be enthusiastic about it?? I think it's obvious the thing we disagree on is our enthusiasm about meat?\n\nI honestly don't know. I hope this is not a stupid post. I just want to know if there was a better way to act in that moment because I want to talk about this with the friends involved and I want to avoid similar situations in the future. I know being quiet is rude and I hadn't explicitly set this boundary before because I am both bad at setting boundaries and afraid of sounding crazy so maybe it was my bad. I just thought it'd be obvious considering I don't really hide my opinions even if I don't bring them up daily, and even if it wasn't I was really sad at her reaction to my lack of interest. Thank you for any judgment.\n\nEDIT: Thank you for all the opinions. Just to give a little more context, I am autistic and bad at communication in general. This usually isn't an issue \u2014 my friends don't mind when I am quiet in conversations etc. It does mean however that I suck at social cues and at understanding how I am perceived by others. When I ignored the conversation, I thought I was being polite, but it was probably passive-aggressive to them unfortunately. I did reply to their questions with words, just not enthusiastically. This wasn't clear in the og post and I apologize. \n\nI also think they were just trying to involve me in the conversation and not trying to make me mad as some of the comments are saying. As uncomfortable as it was I assume they saw I was zoning out and wanted to engage with me. It was just a terrible topic choice. I think the best thing to do would have been to change the topic but unfortunately I was way too nervous in that moment to really plan my actions. I will keep it in mind the next time something like this happens.\n\nMy friends and I are young (18-19) and I don't doubt they are very online and easily influenced. It was just one girl who got really mad. The other was just watching. My main assumption is that there was a preexisting conflict between them and my choice to be vegan for whatever reason. I don't discuss it with them at all so I assume it is some kind of prejudice from watching annoying vegan content etc. Some people can get really defensive about entire groups of people and I understand why. \n\nI will try to talk them about it and apologize. Hopefully they will understand my point of view as well if I explain myself.

Frankly, it kind of doesn't matter if your vegan or not, the question seems to be more how to extract yourself from a conversation politely. I don't think it's a problem that you zoned out the first time, but it's odd that once they brought you back into the conversation, you just \"shrugged and nodded and tried to focus on something else.\" However, imo taking about your favorite meats and insisting a vegan participate in the discussion when they don't want to seems like a mildly AH move to me. I think some ok alternate ways to handle it would have been: 1) straight up say that since you don't eat meat, you don't have a favorite meat and you'd rather just let them discuss amongst themselves and stay out of the conversation. 2) If pushed, that's a good time to simply excuse yourself to \"make a call\" and see if a break in the conversation would lead to new topics in a few minutes. 3) If you came back several minutes later and they were still talking meat, then maybe suggest a a slight shift in topic, like \"I still don't have a favorite meat, but I could talk about my favorite side dishes. I had a leak and mushroom strata the other day that practically blew my mind!...\" And 4) if they were *still* pushing, then that's when I'd say to myself, ok, I have done my best, they are making their own way into AH territory and I'd just excuse myself from the convo entirely.", "Ive ate meat my whole life along with my entire family and the closest we have ever come to a discussion about our favorite meat is the following:\n\n\"Do you want chicken or hamburgers for dinner?\"\n\nNta op but your friends are extremely weird.", "NTA- I don\u2019t typically talk with friends about meat in general, but I sure AF wouldn\u2019t do it if one of my vegan friends were there.

Almost feels like they were baiting you and trying to get a rise out of you if they knew where you stood on this topic. A good friend would say \"wait this convo doesn't include you let's change the topic\"", "Without observing the conversation, I don't know the answer. It depends on what exactly you said and didn't say, and also your nonverbal communication. If it was just that you weren't enthusiastically participating and didn't seem comfortable with the topic, then fine. It is not rude to be quiet or introverted, or to not be super enthusiastic about a topic. On the other hand, if you came across as angry and ignoring them, or somehow implied that you looked down on them for eating meat, that's different. Like if someone asked you a direct question, and you just kind of failed to provide a meaningful response, that is kind of rude. Or if you glared at them with an expression like \"you are monsters for eating meat.\" We often are oblivious to the nonverbal signals we send, even if they are pretty clear to others. I will say that if all of your friends got angry (as opposed to just one super sensitive friend), this suggests you should have handled it differently. A couple other thoughts: When it comes to your opinions about stuff, what is obvious to you is almost NEVER obvious to other people if you don't tell them. People generally are not thinking about you or your beliefs, they are mostly thinking about themselves. In this case, for example, even if they knew you were vegan, they had no way of knowing you were not even comfortable talking about meat until you told them. A lot of vegans would have been perfectly comfortable in this discussion, e.g. \"Yeah I don't miss meat at all\" or \"sometimes I really miss pepperoni.\" I think you should have explained your position the very first time someone asked you a meat question, rather than let this drag on until eventually they got mad. And it could be as simple as, \"I'm sorry, but I think meat is gross, can we talk about something else?\" Anyway, don't wallow in guilt. If it will make you feel better, you could apologize to your friends, like, \"hey I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make you feel bad about for talking about meat.\" If you are comfortable doing so, it might also be a valuable learning experience to ask them why they were so mad, for example, \"I really didn't mean to upset you, could you tell me what I did or said that offended you.\"", "If your response to a direct question was to shrug and ignore them then I can understand you coming off as aloof and antisocial to them.

These people are not your friends because friends wouldn\u2019t torment you like that. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry they were so mean to you. You were uncomfortable and anxious and behaved in an absolutely understandable way.

Being quiet isn't rude, especially if you have a disagreement with the subject matter but don't want to go through the trouble of talking about it. sometimes talking is actually difficult and uncomfortable when you're introverted, people forget it's not some label analogous to \"quirky.\"\n\nExtroverts just sorta don't get this sometimes and for me it's caused scenarios where my coworkers think I dislike them when I'm really just tired of being social and want to go hide and recharge.", "NTA.\nMy aunt is Vegan.

Unbelievable that they would get mad about you being uncomfortable about talking about what meats you used to like to eat. I can relate it to myself being an alcoholic. Sober 8 years.

This shouldn\u2019t be a superiority thing.  It\u2019s as simple as differences in dietary choices.  As long as you\u2019re not preachy or judgmental about it, it\u2019s okay to set boundaries around what you\u2019re willing to talk about. \n\nI\u2019m not offering any judgement because you said you don\u2019t really hide your opinions.  Depending on what those are, you actually may be coming across as feeling superior and this disagreement is a bleed over from that.  I get the vibe that you\u2019re vegan on moral grounds.  And that\u2019s a perfectly valid reason.  But plenty of people aren\u2019t going to share those same moral concerns.  How that gets expressed will determine how that is received. \n\nThat said, the question that needs to be asked:  Do you respect their right to not be vegan?  Respect is a two-way street.

I haven't been in that situation, but visualizing it, I think I'd actually feel apologetic and probably express that, like \"oh sorry [vegan's name], are you cool with us talking about this?\"  I certainly wouldn't get mad at them for not enthusiastically participating in a convo like that. That's just weird af, and makes me think they feel guilty about meat consumption and are lashing out at you for that.\n\nI've had that experience before, where a meat eater feels guilty about eating meat in my presence because I'm a vegetarian, even though I've never said shit about it without being directly asked how I feel about meat consumption (and even then, I'm just like \"I don't personally like it because it makes me feel sad to think of what we put animals through to enable mass consumption of meat, but I understand that a lot of people need meat for various reasons.\" I'm personally pro-meat consumption for Indigenous peoples for whom it's a cultural practice and/or a necessity, and who are doing it in more sustainable and ethical ways).
