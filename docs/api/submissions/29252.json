It\u2019s her mail. Through the door I told her that I returned it to the post office. \n\nShe continues to beat on my door and I panic and called the police on her. The gave her a talked to and she explained she needs this zip code for her job. Crying and just being disturbed.  The apartment manager comes over and tries to diffuse the situation and asks if I just have any any mail  I could give her.

The whole thing isn\u2019t your problem.", "NTA for returning mail. You had no forwarding address so it would have been creepy to keep it. But I think I have to go with YTA for the restraining order. She only came by once and was obviously upset and confused. She likely wouldn't have come by again.", "NTA - I always wright \"Return to sender, no longer at this address\" on other peoples mail. You did what you were supposed to do. It's not like you just threw it away. The lady should have accepted your response and left.", "NTA. It sounds like the apartment manager didn't handle this well. If the police saw this woman's behavior and advised a restraining order, it makes sense that you proceeded.", "NTA - it was her responsibility to enter mail forwarding and change her address.", "NAH, but do hope the lady is able to find a new mailing address soon and help for what's probably rough situation.", "NTA. In my experience, the police do not suggest a restraining order over a dispute like this unless somebody is way out of line. They'd just tell the woman she can't use your mailing address as her own, and she'd back off. Maybe the apartment manager could help her change her mailing address\u2014but if she feels she has a right to use yours so she is in the right zip code for her job, that's a problem she'll have to solve.", "NTA.\n\nSucks that she's going through a tough patch but relentlessly banging on someone's door is not how you get someone to help you.  She should have left or spoken to the property manager directly to try and get some resolutions.  She used to live there, no issues with calling the manager and asking for a little help with the mail.", "YTA. A restraining order because a grieving frightened old woman comes to see if she has any mail?  Talk about no compassion and a complete lack of kindness. YTA.", "ESH \n\nShe shouldn't have kept pushing you after you said you returned it to the post office. You doing a restraining order and calling her crazy is embarrassing and childish and lacks empathy", "NTA for giving mail to the post office YTA for your response to everything else. You come across as extremely young or someone new to NYC (not sure if that\u2019s where you are but just what it sounds like to me)", "NTA for returning the mail, but you are fairly over-reacting to the overall situation (contacting corporate/restraining order).    \n\n\nAlso, this happened once and the police suggest a restraining order on the spot?  That seems odd.", "Everyone sucks- why are you so mad at someone who lost their home and significant other, who came for their mail. I just feel like the lack of emotion and empathy is crazy sometimes. I understand not wanting someone to cause disturbances in your home but that was also her home once, she came to get what she couldn\u2019t get before she had to leave. Sometimes the mail goes to the old address before you can get it switched to a new one. I also understand that maybe the way in which the situation was handled could factor into this but I also think that this could have been a lot better if you didn\u2019t just regard her as some \u201ccrazy ass\u201d old woman. Maybe she was upset or maybe she did raise her voice but at the end of the day if you were in her shoes, would you want someone putting a restraining order against you just because you came to get your mail!?", "NTA.  I have never heard of a job where a person would need a specific zip code.  She needs to put in a change of address.  If she needs a zip code, there are these things called post office boxes she could use.  As someone who had a person not write return to sender on a jury duty notice just leaving it sitting there resulting in a summons to appear (neither can be forwarded), you are doing the correct thing.  There are legal items that cannot be forwarded even with a change of address.  I do think the restraining order is going a bit far.", "ESH. You did the right thing by returning the mail, and you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not your problem whatever she\u2019s going through. Your apartment manager didn\u2019t handle this well and shouldn\u2019t be letting the old lady use the zip code when she\u2019s moved out. However, I think calling her crazy and getting a restraining order is a bit much. If she came over multiple times behaving like this, it would be different, but it was once, she\u2019s an old lady that\u2019s probably not adjusting well.", "She's homeless because her husband died and she has no other way to get mail. I understand not wanting someone else's mail delivered to your new place but I would also understand her extenuating circumstances. Most places/organizations won't even begin to try to help you without a physical address. And you put her down as crazy because she's in a horrible situation? Hell, lose my job, lose my home, have no hope, I might be a tad bit stressed mentally too. Wow, just wow. YTA.", "YTA you could\u2019ve at least tried to help or not be rude", "YTA. Where in your lease does it say that the property manager must inform you of the life circumstances and mental health status of previous tenants?", "I'm confused. I get why you took the mail to the post office the first time, but why, once the situation had an explanation and the apartment manager provided an easy solution (you just giving the mail to him) you dug in your heels and refused.  \n\n\nIs writing return to sender on each envelope so much easier than just handing it off to someone who is trying to make an old woman's last years a little less unpleasant? Is this some kind of \"bootstraps/libertarian ideology\" thing for you?  \n\n\nI think YTA because you seem to feel that your ability to make someone's life difficult is not an unkind, ungenerous, and thoroughly unpleasant thing to do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why are you wasting everyone's time so you can get denied for a restraining order against an old lady who came to your door one time?", "I feel bad for the lady. Her husband died, she lost her apartment and it sounds like she might lose her job now. Showing up at the apartment and terrifying the residents wasn't appropriate but I really hope she finds help.", "Someone aggressively banging on your door isn't entitled to kindness. Especially something that she has no right to in the first place (using someone else's address to get mail).", "Thank you! I feel as though no one has mentioned the complete lack of emotion in this situation and has only talked about whether she should have come for the mail or not.", "Possibly the OP insisted (and possibly the cops agreed and then just didn't bother, because that's extra work...)", "I didn\u2019t know this when she was yelling at me through the door? I only found out after the police arrived to make her leave and talking to the apartment manager.\n\nYou don\u2019t go to strangers doors banging on them for 10 minutes and refuse to leave when you don\u2019t get what you want.", "I dunno.   After telling her the mail was returned, she should have just gone away.  How did it take the police and property manager getting involved?  That's several minutes of hanging around, refusing to leave when you're essentially trespassing.", "NTA. They did help. They returned the mail to the sender as t he ey are legally obligated to do since they had no forwarding address and no knowledge of the mail needing to be held for pick-up for any reason. If the woman who moved out needed to receive her mail in that zip code she could have arranged something with the apartment office or a neighbor she knew rather than just letting it continue to come to her old address. It was the previous tenant who was rude and unreasonable.", "What does that have to do with the actual question of aita for returning mail?", "She needs the zip code, which means she's also committing fraud...", "Thank you! This whole thread of responses is ludicrous. How do I know who's just a grieving, frightened old lady banging at my door? I'm not going to shoot them, but I'm definitely not treating them with kindness when I have zero idea what their intentions are.", "Wouldn\u2019t the world be a bit better if we all took the time to put ourselves into someone else\u2019s shoes. Her world just blew up.", "If that's the case, then they are definitely over-reacting to a solitary event.", "That is true. I can completely understand your side of things, as to why I did not say yta, completely putting the blame on you. Thank you for clarifying. But I also wouldn\u2019t have put a restraining order on someone the first time they ever caused a disturbance. I hope that you have resolved it though. :)", "You responds shows no empathy, which is why there was context given after police arrived and management. Op is the AH for the restraining order and for trying to get the manager in trouble. I understand there was is a grieving process and it could of been handled differently but who are we to tell someone how to grieve when there world just crumbled", "Ok then, NTA for returning mail, YTA for everything else. Feel better?", "OK, but once the situation was explained and an easy solution for the future was offered, why keep making a vengeful production out of it?", "I absolutely agree. It is something my parents have always instilled in me. To have compassion and be understanding towards others situations.", "Yes, everyone grieves differently. But when someone's grieving makes other people feel unsafe, that is not OK. Empathy does not require people to allow others to make them feel unsafe.", "Especially our elders... This wasnt a dangerous junkie knocking on their door, it was an elder who lost their spouse & as a result lost her home, probably doesnt even know about being able to change address online, and is just looking for her mail.\n\nOne day we will all be senior citizens as well, hopefully OP doesnt find herself in a position where some younger A-holes call the cops on her for just trying to navigate life during trauma.", "At this point once the police got there at a certain point it was just about being mad and frustrated which let to unnecessarily restrain order on former tenants. I get where ppl felt unsafe but after hearing context you would think to back off a bit and not take it further then need to be", "If the police felt like it was prudent to suggest a restraining order I would follow their suggestion if I were in OP's place. They were on the scene and made that suggestion after assessing the situation and interacting with the former tenant. So you may see the restraining order as unnecessary but law enforcement felt it was. I'll go with the opinion of the professionals that were there.", "Thts is a suggestion all police use when shit happens like this, part of protocol. But it is up to you to make that decision of whether you do or don\u2019t. It just just because although it was there right to they didn\u2019t have to is the point.", "And there is a reason it is part of the protocol which is the point."]}
