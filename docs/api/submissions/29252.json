In my experience, the police do not suggest a restraining order over a dispute like this unless somebody is way out of line. They'd just tell the woman she can't use your mailing address as her own, and she'd back off. Maybe the apartment manager could help her change her mailing address\u2014but if she feels she has a right to use yours so she is in the right zip code for her job, that's a problem she'll have to solve.", "NTA.\n\nSucks that she's going through a tough patch but relentlessly banging on someone's door is not how you get someone to help you.

You doing a restraining order and calling her crazy is embarrassing and childish and lacks empathy", "NTA for giving mail to the post office YTA for your response to everything else. You come across as extremely young or someone new to NYC (not sure if that\u2019s where you are but just what it sounds like to me)", "NTA for returning the mail, but you are fairly over-reacting to the overall situation (contacting corporate/restraining order).    \n\n\nAlso, this happened once and the police suggest a restraining order on the spot?  That seems odd.", "Everyone sucks- why are you so mad at someone who lost their home and significant other, who came for their mail. I just feel like the lack of emotion and empathy is crazy sometimes. I understand not wanting someone to cause disturbances in your home but that was also her home once, she came to get what she couldn\u2019t get before she had to leave. Sometimes the mail goes to the old address before you can get it switched to a new one. I also understand that maybe the way in which the situation was handled could factor into this but I also think that this could have been a lot better if you didn\u2019t just regard her as some \u201ccrazy ass\u201d old woman. Maybe she was upset or maybe she did raise her voice but at the end of the day if you were in her shoes, would you want someone putting a restraining order against you just because you came to get your mail!?", "NTA.  I have never heard of a job where a person would need a specific zip code.  She needs to put in a change of address.  If she needs a zip code, there are these things called post office boxes she could use.  As someone who had a person not write return to sender on a jury duty notice just leaving it sitting there resulting in a summons to appear (neither can be forwarded), you are doing the correct thing.  There are legal items that cannot be forwarded even with a change of address.  I do think the restraining order is going a bit far.", "ESH. You did the right thing by returning the mail, and you\u2019re right, it\u2019s not your problem whatever she\u2019s going through. Your apartment manager didn\u2019t handle this well and shouldn\u2019t be letting the old lady use the zip code when she\u2019s moved out.

I understand not wanting someone else's mail delivered to your new place but I would also understand her extenuating circumstances. Most places/organizations won't even begin to try to help you without a physical address. And you put her down as crazy because she's in a horrible situation?

Where in your lease does it say that the property manager must inform you of the life circumstances and mental health status of previous tenants?", "I'm confused. I get why you took the mail to the post office the first time, but why, once the situation had an explanation and the apartment manager provided an easy solution (you just giving the mail to him) you dug in your heels and refused.  \n\n\nIs writing return to sender on each envelope so much easier than just handing it off to someone who is trying to make an old woman's last years a little less unpleasant? Is this some kind of \"bootstraps/libertarian ideology\" thing for you?  \n\n\nI think YTA because you seem to feel that your ability to make someone's life difficult is not an unkind, ungenerous, and thoroughly unpleasant thing to do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They returned the mail to the sender as t he ey are legally obligated to do since they had no forwarding address and no knowledge of the mail needing to be held for pick-up for any reason.

Her world just blew up.", "If that's the case, then they are definitely over-reacting to a solitary event.", "That is true. I can completely understand your side of things, as to why I did not say yta, completely putting the blame on you. Thank you for clarifying. But I also wouldn\u2019t have put a restraining order on someone the first time they ever caused a disturbance. I hope that you have resolved it though. :)", "You responds shows no empathy, which is why there was context given after police arrived and management. Op is the AH for the restraining order and for trying to get the manager in trouble. I understand there was is a grieving process and it could of been handled differently but who are we to tell someone how to grieve when there world just crumbled", "Ok then, NTA for returning mail, YTA for everything else.

I'll go with the opinion of the professionals that were there.", "Thts is a suggestion all police use when shit happens like this, part of protocol.

No, none of this is your problem but the apartment company is also not required to disclose any information and previous tenants (honestly it might even be illegal depending on where you are).
