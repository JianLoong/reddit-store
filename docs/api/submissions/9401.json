It was a great event, and things were going well for most of the evening. This was the first time I met Maggie's mother, but I had already met the rest of her family. \n\nWhen it came time for the bouquet \ud83d\udc90 toss, Maggie was one of the ladies in the group to try & catch it. I thought I had an opportunity to be funny and lift the mood, so I stood behind Maggie and slapped the flowers \ud83d\udc90 to the ground before she could catch them. Idk if she actually would have been the one to catch them, but I did it anyways. I was doing it as a joke, which I thought would be obvious to everyone (I was like 0.0001% serious, I'm actually not interested in marriage. I'm in my 20s). I really had no bad intentions & wasn't trying to upset anyone, I thought I would get a chuckle from the crowd.\u00a0 \n\nAfter I slapped the bouquet \ud83d\udc90 to the floor there was an audible *gasp* from everyone around, followed by an awkward silence. I was a little embarrassed but I laughed anyways to try to nonverbally show everyone that it was a joke. Nobody laughed. \n\nAfter a bit the moment had passed, and everyone was starting a big dinner. Nobody talked to me and I was getting a couple sideways glances. Maggie's mother eventually pulled me aside and (very respectfully) asked me to leave. To which I obliged. I didn't want to cause a scene. \n\n\nA few weeks later my GF & her sister are over it, but the mom still seems weird about it. I haven't spoken to her since then. Was this an AH move? Or was it just a lighthearted joke that was misinterpreted?", "created_utc": 1675811641, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10wgcq5/aita_for_interfering_in_the_bouquet_toss_at_my/", "score": 486, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were not funny.   You apparently do not know what funny is.\n\nI doubt your GF's sister is actually over it, she is just trying not to interfere in her sisters relationship.

Why did you decide to make this about you? It is not even your family.", "YTA and so rude and insulting to your girlfriend, she may not want to marry you either but she had to participate in this and you humiliated her AND her parents who likely had all their friends in attendance asking what AH your GF is dating.\nYou need to fall on the sword and make a major apology to her mother if you want any chance at a future with her.", "Yeah, YTA -- I think you knew that already.", "YTA\n\n>I thought I had an opportunity to be funny and lift the mood.\n\n\n\u2026Did.

Nobody talked to me and I was getting a couple sideways glances. Maggie's mother eventually pulled me aside and (very respectfully) asked me to leave. To which I obliged.
