My husband is her youngest child (30) and the only one out of her children who didn't have any children so originally I thought she was just projecting her excitement over him finally having a baby in weird ways but that's definitely not it. She does not act like this at all with any of her other kids and she 100% never acted like this toward my husband UNTIL she found out I was pregnant (we announced it after we found out the gender).\n\nAnyways, she has always been a super modest, very conservative woman. She showed zero skin because it wasn't \"lady like\". She never ever made any hint of inappropriate comments. She never would have dreamed about discussing her bedroom life. It simply was not who she was, or so I thought. But after I got pregnant she started showing up to my house randomly 2-3 times a week and asking my husband to leave with her to go run errands and other miscellaneous stuff that she could 100% do herself, with the excuse of \"I figured you'd like to go with me and get out of the house\". That's not weird but then it amped up to her started to show up with her bust completely revealed and asking my husband if he liked her shirt or if he liked her pants that look like they were painted on. Doing little spins for him. Then started the comments about her BF being a drunk and not being able to \"get it up\" and complaining that she wasn't having her needs met and how she needed a real man. Started coming over with gifts of money and expensive watches, etc for my husband. Literally showed up to our baby shower with stuff for my husband, not the baby. Started bringing him food (just him, not me) saying \"I figured you missed Mama's cooking\" (he hates her cooking and it always hit the trash can when she left). I had our daughter 3 months ago and shes held her twice, despite coming here once a week to steal my husband away. But the tipping point was her coming here yesterday unannounced at 7am and told my husband \"we need to take your pubes and glue them to your head. We know you got plenty.\" (He's balding). He just kind of looked at her and said \"what the fuck? That's weird.\" He was wearing grey sweats with no underwear and shit was clearly visible. He immediately went and changed. His whole demeanor changed after that comment and he looked super uncomfortable but she laughed it off. She did however keep touching him (rubbing his arms and back). After she left I told him I really don't want her here anymore. She makes me uncomfortable and quite frankly, she's starting to gross me the fuck out. I asked how he felt about it and how she's been acting and he said \"I don't get it, this is not the mom I know. She's acting like I'm her fucking husband but I can't just tell her she can't come here. She was a single mom. I'm her baby, blah blah blah\". He said I'm wrong in asking that she not be allowed here anymore, despite agreeing that she's being over the top weird. I don't want her near my kid. AITA?\n\nETA: as many have mentioned, I did consider this could be medically related to something. I honestly was leaning toward Dementia or Alzheimer's because I frequently see certain signs of this in my line of work (medical technician at a dementia unit). Dementia and Alzheimer's don't run in the family so originally I was fought on testing but she did agree to have a brain scan done a week ago because she was having migraines. My husband went with her to the appointment and the brain scan came back normal. From what my husband said, he did in fact ask the doctor if her scan showed any signs of possible deterioration that could be linked to Alzheimer's or Dementia and they said they had not seen any signs of that. She still acts completely normal at family functions when everyone else is around. Super reserved, not making inappropriate comments. When she's at my house and around my husband it's a completely different story. She acts like a nun in a cucumber patch.

Distancing herself from the baby and you so that she can feel like young once again.\n\nYou and your husband need to sit her down and talk to her. Tell her that what she is doing is not okay and is pushing him away from her. Her role as a grandmother is not about being old but just someone new to love. That grandmothers can be young, and sexy and anything they want. If she wants a younger man then she can go for it. \n\nThink of it as her way of going through a midlife crisis. Men are not the only ones to go through it. We go through them with life.

You said she acts totally the opposite around everyone else, so she absolutely knows what she's doing is inappropriate.

She's counting on your husband never saying or doing anything about it and that he won't want you to either. \n\nI don't know your in-law family situation.

I thought some just like those would be cute for a girl's night.\" And go from there. But that's a throwing a grenade into the mix kind of thing and that might not work for you and your husband. Because he would need a heads up and be ok with it, too. \n\nYou are definitely right that this is not normal or ok. Keep pointing out everything that is abnormal and wrong about her behavior and by writing things down and taking videos and pictures, you will have dates to show how long and how frequently it happens.

Instead of, \"she's being weird and gross and making me uncomfortable and I don't want her around anymore\" (which is valid), come from a place of concern. Approach your husband about sitting down with his mom (maybe in public) and asking if she's feeling okay, because she's not acting like the mom he knows, and he misses her. Your husband cannot let this continue, if not for your marriage, then for his mother's sanity and wellbeing. \n\nWith the sisters, maybe try, \"\\[husband\\] and I have noticed some extreme changes to MIL's behavior and we are concerned for her, because this is not healthy at all. We want to get her help and get to the bottom of the issue.\" And get the sisters in between the MIL and the husband. Your husband needs to talk to his sisters and tell them what's going on, since they don't believe you. \n\nIt doesn't sound like she's very interested in the baby, but maybe a door cam and changing the locks would be good. She sounds like she would go through your dressers to look for underwear or something.", "NTA but your husband needs to stop the visits. It's your house and safe space to. He needs to be able to prot ct that and not make excuses. Ask him straight how she would feel if she did this behavior to you guys child. There would be nothing he could say that wouldn't make you snap. He needs to set boundaries and man up.", "Definitely NTA. Husband should not be alone with his mother in any circumstance and you should video tape her behaving this way. I know you don't want to see her but may be worth it to be able to show others her grossly inappropriate behavior.", "Time for some cameras around the house. Record all the interactions when she comes over. After a few times, take the recordings to his family. It will absolutely stop. Might have some blowback too, so be prepared.", "NTA\u2026 sounds really creepy.", "NTA. If he won't confront her, then you need to do it in front of him. And also tell her it makes him uncomfortable as well as you, & ya'll do not want that behavior around your child. However, you do need to be gentle with her as much as possible, because it could still be a mental health issue.", "NTA. That's extremely disturbing especially with him being the ONLY boy. Record the behavior because you will have to call her out to have any chance of stopping it and since it is so out of character for her, if she plays victim or denies it, then I don't see anyone backing you up.", "NTA ew and no, sorry that your husband won\u2019t defend himself from that nastiness but it needs to be shut down. It needs to be two yes, one no when it comes to having people over - that includes for MIL.

You have a right to not have anyone who makes you uncomfortable in your home or around your child.

This is very incestuous. She may be feeling some kind of way because her \"baby\" is about to be a father, but that's something she needs to work out with a therapist. Your husband shouldn't have to be careful of what he wears at home because his mom is ogling his junk \ud83e\udd2e", "As an aside- people can have dementia without it showing up on scans.", "It\u2019s important to note that Alzheimer\u2019s dementia won\u2019t show up on a brain scan. The only way to diagnose it for sure is by brain biopsy. Since that isn\u2019t a popular diagnostic tool, it\u2019s basically a clinical diagnosis. There are lots of different types of dementia, though. A neuropsychological evaluation by a psychologist can be helpful in ruling in/out an organic brain condition.\n\nIn an older individual any sudden change in behavior is concerning. It doesn\u2019t mean anything is wrong, but it\u2019s good to be thinking about it.\n\nI have treated dementia patients with increased libido. It\u2019s not super common, but it does occur.

Maybe seeing it more as a bystander would knock some sense into him.

I hope your husband takes your side and goes LC to NC with anyone involved whos defending your MILs actions", "Record it and show the SIL?", "Video her behavior.

What are you trying to suggest?\"\n\nInstead of just reacting, force her to explain/elaborate.\n\nThe reality is that a lot of MILs get some weird things happening when they become grandmas, and it can be unique to only one of their sons.

Just keep it general like she's lost her filter and says some odd things, or sometimes she's dressing very differently.

You\u2019re not the asshole but neither is he in this situation either, that\u2019s his mom so I know it\u2019s going to be hard for him to grasp that his mom definitely should not be around with this weird persona of hers.
