My husband is her youngest child (30) and the only one out of her children who didn't have any children so originally I thought she was just projecting her excitement over him finally having a baby in weird ways but that's definitely not it. She does not act like this at all with any of her other kids and she 100% never acted like this toward my husband UNTIL she found out I was pregnant (we announced it after we found out the gender).\n\nAnyways, she has always been a super modest, very conservative woman. She showed zero skin because it wasn't \"lady like\". She never ever made any hint of inappropriate comments. She never would have dreamed about discussing her bedroom life. It simply was not who she was, or so I thought. But after I got pregnant she started showing up to my house randomly 2-3 times a week and asking my husband to leave with her to go run errands and other miscellaneous stuff that she could 100% do herself, with the excuse of \"I figured you'd like to go with me and get out of the house\". That's not weird but then it amped up to her started to show up with her bust completely revealed and asking my husband if he liked her shirt or if he liked her pants that look like they were painted on. Doing little spins for him. Then started the comments about her BF being a drunk and not being able to \"get it up\" and complaining that she wasn't having her needs met and how she needed a real man. Started coming over with gifts of money and expensive watches, etc for my husband. Literally showed up to our baby shower with stuff for my husband, not the baby. Started bringing him food (just him, not me) saying \"I figured you missed Mama's cooking\" (he hates her cooking and it always hit the trash can when she left). I had our daughter 3 months ago and shes held her twice, despite coming here once a week to steal my husband away. But the tipping point was her coming here yesterday unannounced at 7am and told my husband \"we need to take your pubes and glue them to your head. We know you got plenty.\" (He's balding). He just kind of looked at her and said \"what the fuck? That's weird.\" He was wearing grey sweats with no underwear and shit was clearly visible. He immediately went and changed. His whole demeanor changed after that comment and he looked super uncomfortable but she laughed it off. She did however keep touching him (rubbing his arms and back). After she left I told him I really don't want her here anymore. She makes me uncomfortable and quite frankly, she's starting to gross me the fuck out. I asked how he felt about it and how she's been acting and he said \"I don't get it, this is not the mom I know. She's acting like I'm her fucking husband but I can't just tell her she can't come here. She was a single mom. I'm her baby, blah blah blah\". He said I'm wrong in asking that she not be allowed here anymore, despite agreeing that she's being over the top weird. I don't want her near my kid. AITA?\n\nETA: as many have mentioned, I did consider this could be medically related to something. I honestly was leaning toward Dementia or Alzheimer's because I frequently see certain signs of this in my line of work (medical technician at a dementia unit). Dementia and Alzheimer's don't run in the family so originally I was fought on testing but she did agree to have a brain scan done a week ago because she was having migraines. My husband went with her to the appointment and the brain scan came back normal. From what my husband said, he did in fact ask the doctor if her scan showed any signs of possible deterioration that could be linked to Alzheimer's or Dementia and they said they had not seen any signs of that. She still acts completely normal at family functions when everyone else is around. Super reserved, not making inappropriate comments. When she's at my house and around my husband it's a completely different story. She acts like a nun in a cucumber patch.

It sounds like he needs help sorting out what his priorities are (I'm 90% betting deep down, it's you and baby, but he needs to work through that and see that issues will arise/harm is caused when this gets out of order)", "NTA< when I read your story the first thing that popped in my head was \"Oh she is scared of getting old\". She doesn't feel that she is ready to be a grandmother. She thinks I am only in my 50s and still vibrant and sexual and all those crazy things we older women say to ourselves when we get hit with the old feeling.\n\n The issue is that instead of accepting the new role she freaked out and started trying to act younger than her real age. Distancing herself from the baby and you so that she can feel like young once again.\n\nYou and your husband need to sit her down and talk to her. Tell her that what she is doing is not okay and is pushing him away from her. Her role as a grandmother is not about being old but just someone new to love. That grandmothers can be young, and sexy and anything they want. If she wants a younger man then she can go for it. \n\nThink of it as her way of going through a midlife crisis. Men are not the only ones to go through it. We go through them with life. She will be fine but the talk needs to happen ASAP or it will get out of hand and she will try to sleep with him (gross). \n\nGood luck and congrats on the new addition in your family", "NTA.  I've seen your edit about getting a brain scan.  It sounds like she is having a later mid life crisis or break of some kind.  She definitely needs help.  I'm sorry you are dealing with this.", "NTA.

Maybe suggest couples therapy if you think it\u2019s more likely he\u2019d agree to that.  Then you can bring up the issue with the therapist and frame it in a way where you are looking for a compromise, his mother has been making you uncomfortable but he doesn\u2019t want to completely stop spending time with her.  This will give you the opening you need to discuss the behavior with a professional.\n\nAnd if this is a genuine medical issue therapy will help him navigate that too.", "NAH - I think you need to worry less about kicking her out of your home and more about helping her.  Something is going on, medically.", "NTA. Your MIL has had a change in her personality which is worrisome. I get that your husband is uncomfortable telling his mother to stop coming over but his being uncomfortable does not trump what is best for the family particularly your child. No one wants to see that. Ew. I would have suggested a complete physical because sudden personality changes can mean a stroke or something involving the brain. But she's had a brain scan. And, you said she's her normal self around other family members. Plus this didn't start until you announced your pregnancy. Maybe this has something to do with your husband. Just spitballing here. Does he have a different father? And, your MIL is remembering that experience ...inappropriately placing those feelings on her son. I would start recording her when she comes over. Put a cam on the door and one in the common area. Don't tell her initially. Get some evidence and once she knows about the cams they will serve as a deterrent.", "NTA, video her the next time she comes over & acts inappropriately.

Friends? Co-workers? This sounds like she may have a heath/cognitive issue.", "If this is a sudden change in personality she needs to see a doctor immediately.  IANAD but she may have had a small stroke.\n\nYou and your husband need to be on the same page with this.  His mom needs help.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to be seen by a doctor.  A complete change in personality and particularly inappropriate behavior seems indicative of a medical issue.", "NTA, You guys need to be a united front, agree on acceptable boundaries, communicate them with her, and enforce them.

I've worked with people who've had strokes and also some were in different stages of Dementia. Let's not gaslight OP and find excuses for creepy behaviour. \nSome old gen boy mothers (and some sisters) are notorious for emotional incest.", "NTA, it's a hard transition for some moms to make when their son gets married and has kids, but MIL needs therapy or medical intervention. This is way beyond what's normal.", "NTA\n\nBut have you guys considered she might be showing early signs of dementia?
