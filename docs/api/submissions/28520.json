Your baby daddy is financial abusive.  Even threatening you.  Call a crisis helpline and get their advice for dealing with this situation.  It will escalate.\n\nHopefully apart from her ex, your mother will be there to support you.  Any friends?  Other family?", "NTA \n\nYou don\u2019t need to justify wanting to go to your father\u2019s funeral and wanting to take your son with you. Your boyfriend should be supporting your choices and not setting rules that stop you saying goodbye to your father.  \nIf he is worried about your son then he should come with you and look after his child.", "If you love your son, you need to get him away from your boyfriend. You said your boyfriend has punched a door over your son's crying and has said he will make you regret going to your dad's funeral. He's sending the message that he will hurt you. It's going to escalate and he will very likely physically abuse both you and your son. \n\nThe good he provides you and your son is nothing compared to the bad that's coming. As difficult as it would be to be a single mother, it's much more difficult to recover from an abusive partner and deal with the guilt of allowing your son to be abused. I'm sorry that there is a lot of pain in your future. You can choose to bear pain as an act of love for your son or to bear pain out of fear of your boyfriend. I wish you strength, courage, and compassion. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Can you travel with a friend who can help you out?\n\nI've been looking at other comments, and am very concerned about this abusive boyfriend. I really think you need to cut ties with this guy", "Info:  Why won't you go alone?  Won't lie I'm kinda with your partner because there is absolutely no reason or benefit for you taking a 6 month old on a road trip 2 states away.", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is an abusive asshole though.", "NTA. And seek help and ways to get away from this \u201cman\u201d\n\nHe will be keep you trapped if it continues at this rate. \n\nBest of luck", "NTA   you've made emends and bringing your son will possibly help with your closure and the path forward.   \n\ntake him with you, especially if baby daddy cant take care of him for 4-5 days", "INFO: If your boyfriend is responsible for the bills while you're responsible for the baby, why is it that your 'raging alcoholic\" father had to step in, what sounds like more than once to pay your bills? What's your baby daddy doing with his money??\n\nNo way in hell would I leave my baby with someone who has violent and abusive tendencies. He got so mad that your child was crying that he's punching up the home?? You don't trust him to watch your baby because you know your son would not be safe with him. You remind me of my friend and im gonna tell you the same thing I tell her; RUN!!!\n\nIf your mom is willing to watch your son while you're away then do that, if not, take your baby and go to the funeral. You'll regret it if you don't.  As to his threats, start gathering evidence that will show how unfit he is as a parent. And BE CAREFUL. A man that so freely threatens you is dangerous\n\nNTA", "Is it possible that your dad was trying to get back into your life, not because of your baby, but because he saw his baby needed help? Your boyfriend does not sound like a loving or safe person. I know you\u2019ve got to have a million things going on in your head, but take the time to consider if this is how you want your baby to be raised. You deserve better.", "Go ahead and downvote but I'm just going to say truth OP need to hear \n\nYTA:  First because mothers or fathers can't just take a child out of state without the other parent permission especially when the child is under a year. \n\nSecond hard truth. You put yourself in a situation where you are financially dependent on someone that legally doesn't have to support you.  Seriously what happens if he break up with you tomorrow.  You're screwed", "Generally taking a baby to a funeral is not a great idea. I would say this irrelevant of who your father was because babies pick up on their environment and funerals a very emotionally charged. So I think taking your son is a very bad idea. I also think driving two states away while highly emotional with a baby in the car just plain isn't safe.\n\nAs for the rest of it, if your dad had to pay your electric bill it tells me you and your bf have no money. If he can't pay the electricity/has trouble paying general household expenses I get him being unwilling to assist with the cost of your father's final arrangements or take the day(s) off work/lend you the only vehicle so you can attend the funeral. Sounds like money is very tight in your household.\n\nI'm sorry for your situation. This guy was still your father no matter how badly he messed up his life. I don't necessarily disagree with you bf not giving you money, allowing you to take the baby or lending his car to cross multiple state lines, but I do think he could be more empathetic to your situation. Asking your mum for empathy may be a bit much given she had to raise you alone with minimal support, but your bf should definitely be kinder. \n\nAs for what you do about the funeral, sorry I don't have an answer. I don't think anyone is obligated to assist you and you have no job to pay yourself. Maybe see if your mum can lend you money for a bus ticket and watch your son while your gone. Again I'm sorry for your pain.", "YTA You should go. I think it would be upsetting for your son.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If the OP suddenly comes into a decent amount of money then her bf would no longer have financial control over her, which means he could escalate other forms of abuse.  OP needs to be very careful in the near future as she has some hard decisions to make.", "Umm, that sounds illegal.", "Or OP can go alone.  Why would you want a 6 month old to travel on a car 2 states away for a funeral.  There is no benefit to the child being there.  \n\nWouldn't it make more sense for OP to go and leave the child  at home?", "You don\u2019t take a colicy baby on a road trip like that.", "if I could trust my boyfriend to actually take care of our son, I would. But our son has colic/reflux, we go through about 4 or 5 outfit changes a day, my boyfriend complains about how much he cries and has actually gotten angry over it and punched a door in our apartment. He works and I stay home because he \"doesn't trust daycares\" and I do 90% of the care taking for our son anyways.", "It's not true that you can't take your own child to another state without the other parent's permission unless you have a custody order that prohibits you from doing so or if you are a non custodial parent.  If OP and her boyfriend have no custody agreement he can't legally stop her.  That doesn't mean he can't take her to Court after the fact.  And he sounds like a controlling, abusive jerk who just might.  OP needs to be careful and certainly save any and all communication with the boyfriend to have to use in Court if necessary, especially that statement that he'll make her regret it.  I think OP should try to get that threat in a text or something.  \nShe probably cannot legally move out of state with the child without the other parent's permission; that varies based on how her state interprets their custody situation.  If they have a custody agreement that's formalized then she must abide by it.\n\nSource:      https://www.custodyxchange.com/topics/custody/advice/taking-child-out-of-state.php", "it is not", "Aside from the fact that he's 6 months old, so it's perfectly reasonable for her to want to keep him with her, no, it would not make more sense for her to leave him behind because he has colic and his father gets angry when he cries.

This boyfriend sounds like the sort who, in the near future, might be the reason your mother will attending your funeral.", "Your boyfriend is violent and dangerous. It is not normal or okay to physically damage your living space, and his threat that he will \"make sure you regret it\" is extremely concerning. You are in danger, and so is your infant son.

So that means everywhere I go the baby goes", "what?   apparently you've never hear of car seats.  I took my 6 month old TWINS from La to Va to GTFO out of La for a few weeks.   putting children in a car for a drive is now a bad idea?    \n\nasinine comment of the month award.", "Oh, absolutely she'd be in trouble financially.  She needs to find a better way to support herself and her son.  The boyfriend is very problematic here.", "If they aren't married and there's no custody agreement, it is absolutely legal. Doesn't mean he can't take her to court, but as the primary caregiver, who took the child to get out of a bad situation, she'll hopefully have the advantage in court.", "Did you read the comment I responded to. Where she said the child has colic and reflux issues. Causing them to go through 5 outfit changes a day probably because the baby will vomit on themselves.  \n\nThat's why I asked why she thought it was a good idea to bring the child. Geeze", "Maybe she thinks it's a good idea because it's still safer than leaving the baby with her boyfriend.", "But she's the one who's been dealing with that 24/7, not her mother and not her partner (who by her account just gets angry with the baby having colic, so could she even trust him to care properly for him?).\n\nThe baby can wear old clothes in the car seat (which will hold him in a posture where he won't inhale vomit) and she can pull over and change his clothes as needed during the journey. He'll probably actually sleep better in the car anyway. \n\nThen she can hope to get through the ceremony without incident, but if the baby does vomit during then she's still the best person to handle that.  \n\nDealing with a child with chronic colic is persistent monitoring to keep the child safe/clean, but each incident is usually fairly small and can be dealt with quickly and discreetly.\n\nOP is NTA, and the boyfriend sounds unworthy of her.", "I read it.  Colic is a thing, see my post where I posted about twins WHO HAD COLIC  and drove from louisiana to virginia. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGeeze.  live much?", "So genuinely curious were your twins the same way where you had to change their outfits 5 times a day?  If so how did that go for the ride did you constantly have to stop to change them or calm them down as they were crying? \n\nBecause I guess you're assuming I think OP an asshole but I'm asking for her sake.  I see no reason to bring a baby 2 states away for a funeral. Nothing there is beneficial to the child. It's just extra work for her."]}
