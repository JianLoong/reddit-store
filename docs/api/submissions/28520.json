As difficult as it would be to be a single mother, it's much more difficult to recover from an abusive partner and deal with the guilt of allowing your son to be abused.

He got so mad that your child was crying that he's punching up the home?? You don't trust him to watch your baby because you know your son would not be safe with him. You remind me of my friend and im gonna tell you the same thing I tell her; RUN!!!\n\nIf your mom is willing to watch your son while you're away then do that, if not, take your baby and go to the funeral.

You deserve better.", "Go ahead and downvote but I'm just going to say truth OP need to hear \n\nYTA:  First because mothers or fathers can't just take a child out of state without the other parent permission especially when the child is under a year. \n\nSecond hard truth. You put yourself in a situation where you are financially dependent on someone that legally doesn't have to support you.  Seriously what happens if he break up with you tomorrow.  You're screwed", "Generally taking a baby to a funeral is not a great idea. I would say this irrelevant of who your father was because babies pick up on their environment and funerals a very emotionally charged. So I think taking your son is a very bad idea. I also think driving two states away while highly emotional with a baby in the car just plain isn't safe.\n\nAs for the rest of it, if your dad had to pay your electric bill it tells me you and your bf have no money. If he can't pay the electricity/has trouble paying general household expenses I get him being unwilling to assist with the cost of your father's final arrangements or take the day(s) off work/lend you the only vehicle so you can attend the funeral. Sounds like money is very tight in your household.\n\nI'm sorry for your situation. This guy was still your father no matter how badly he messed up his life. I don't necessarily disagree with you bf not giving you money, allowing you to take the baby or lending his car to cross multiple state lines, but I do think he could be more empathetic to your situation. Asking your mum for empathy may be a bit much given she had to raise you alone with minimal support, but your bf should definitely be kinder. \n\nAs for what you do about the funeral, sorry I don't have an answer. I don't think anyone is obligated to assist you and you have no job to pay yourself. Maybe see if your mum can lend you money for a bus ticket and watch your son while your gone.

If the OP suddenly comes into a decent amount of money then her bf would no longer have financial control over her, which means he could escalate other forms of abuse.  OP needs to be very careful in the near future as she has some hard decisions to make.", "Umm, that sounds illegal.", "Or OP can go alone.  Why would you want a 6 month old to travel on a car 2 states away for a funeral.

If OP and her boyfriend have no custody agreement he can't legally stop her.  That doesn't mean he can't take her to Court after the fact.  And he sounds like a controlling, abusive jerk who just might.  OP needs to be careful and certainly save any and all communication with the boyfriend to have to use in Court if necessary, especially that statement that he'll make her regret it.  I think OP should try to get that threat in a text or something.  \nShe probably cannot legally move out of state with the child without the other parent's permission; that varies based on how her state interprets their custody situation.

She needs to find a better way to support herself and her son.  The boyfriend is very problematic here.", "If they aren't married and there's no custody agreement, it is absolutely legal. Doesn't mean he can't take her to court, but as the primary caregiver, who took the child to get out of a bad situation, she'll hopefully have the advantage in court.", "Did you read the comment I responded to.

He'll probably actually sleep better in the car anyway. \n\nThen she can hope to get through the ceremony without incident, but if the baby does vomit during then she's still the best person to handle that.  \n\nDealing with a child with chronic colic is persistent monitoring to keep the child safe/clean, but each incident is usually fairly small and can be dealt with quickly and discreetly.\n\nOP is NTA, and the boyfriend sounds unworthy of her.", "I read it.

Basically you have a legal entity that is the deceased's estate, and this entity pays for the funeral as well as legitimate costs incurred administering the estate. What is left over is then handed over to the inheritors. \n\nIt doesn't matter if your dad gives everything to somebody else, if you handle the funeral you get reimbursed for that service before the inheritance is paid out. Likewise if you are the executor you can have certain costs covered. Lawyer fees, home clearance, transport of goods to an auction house (proceeds from sales will go towards the inheritance) and, yes, also travel costs (ticket, hotel etc) necessary to handle the funeral or estate business. \n\nSo your boyfriend might not actually be able to prevent you from going by withholding money and his car. Just jump on a jet and live at your dad's place. BTW if your dad rented then in many cases the estate will continue paying rent for a limited time so you can finish house clearing.", "Nope.  NO!
