I get people have to leave babies for work or emergencies or whatever, but leaving a baby that young for that long and risking attachment disorders just so you can attend a party is kind of gross. Why couldn\u2019t the parents bring the baby for the weekend and just get a sitter for the actual wedding itself?

Tell your mom to babysit next time.", "NTA you tried to refuse and they gave it to you anyway first of all, second I just took care of my sisters, dog and cat for two nights and she paid me 115 bucks your mom needs to chill.", "NTA. They offered the money, you gave up your weekend. So\u2026they\u2019re ok with it, you\u2019re ok with it\u2026sorry Mama, looks like YTA!", "NTA: they were showing you their appreciation for jumping in and doing them a HUGE ask. This transaction or arrangement is between you and your brother and SIL. Don\u2019t feel bad you told them they didn\u2019t have pay you they insisted you thanked them done. You did awesome on your own with a 5 month old kudos to you and being trustworthy enough that you brother and SIL had no issues asking you to do this for them.", "Then why didn\u2019t your mother babysit for free?", "I doubt it would cover an entire day even never mind a week. NTA op", "Yeah, if mom doesn\u2019t want her to accept money then SHE can go watch the grandchild OVERNIGHT for free.", "And buy food for herself, the least they could have done is leave food in the house.", "I babysat my newborn brother at 11 years old.", "Is food that expensive in the US? $80 for three days?!", "Everything except food for the person caring for him.", "What?!?! Thats nuts!!!", "That's so neglectful as to be abuse.", "Alone for an entire weekend when he was 5 months old????", "Depends on what you\u2019re eating. Bread/eggs/cheese/lunch meats/etc for three days is doable, but not takeout.", "I wouldn't be comfortable with it either, but people are different. Just because it's not something we're comfortable with doesn't mean that applies to everyone. And it certainly doesn't mean the post is fake. People do things every minute of every day that it wouldn't even occur for you to do. That's diversity in humanity for ya.", "At that point I was keeping him alive for 10 hours. The point being that a 17 old could easily keep a 5 month old baby alive for 36 hours. \ud83d\ude44", "Why would you get takeaway for nine meals? \n\nHang on... only bread eggs cold meat, you can't afford to cook on $80?! That's incredible.", "Which they clearly did.  And I'm sorry, 10 hours is very different than 48 hours, with the parents being in a completely different state in case some thing happened.  OP themselves said they weren't comfortable and they were driving around with the baby because there was no food in this house.  That said, to each their own.", "I can absolutely cook for three days on $80, but I like to cook, was raised learning to do so, and am good at it. I listed the options above because those are quick and easy to prepare. \n\nOP may not be good at food prep, willing or allowed to use another kitchen, etc.", "That doesn\u2019t make this post a lie.", "That would be arseholery, to ask someone to housesit and ban them from using the kitchen.\n\nBut yes you have allayed my shock on the cost of food ingredients in the US.", "Also, baby is comfortable in their own environment with their own things. Can you also imagine what you would need to pack to take baby to someone else's home?", "Yep.  I was wrong and have been properly schooled on the matter:)", "I already think it\u2019s assholery to ask a teenager to babysit for so little money, even if food is included, FWIW.", "I also don't think that it's a particularly good idea. That doesn't mean that I find it very hard to believe.", "Yeah the pay interaction is rather weird.", "I honestly thought no way - but as the comments suggest, I'm clearly wrong."]}
