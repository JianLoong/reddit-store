She\u2019s never been around either of them or met them. I had plan a trip to Disney bc it\u2019s been a hard year and we deserve a treat. I reached out a offer to pay for the expenses of traveling and food for EX/BD and his son, my daughter\u2019s half brother but he would have to pay for Disney for them if he wanted to go. He doesn\u2019t make much that\u2019s why I gave him this offer and I don\u2019t make enough to pay a in full trip for him and his son. If I made enough I would. He has texted me telling me he can\u2019t afford to pay for him and his son to go to Disney. Me not wanting him to miss out on memories with his first daughter I offer to pay for him in full and he just takes time without them to spend time with his first born daughter. He replied back saying that\u2019s not fair bc he brought the idea up to his family (son, step daughter, and gf) and they want to go. I said that\u2019s not my problem and I can\u2019t afford them. That I\u2019m happy to pay the travel expenses and food for him and half brother. He replied back that he knows how much I make and I can pay for all of them no problem, which isn\u2019t true bc I\u2019m the only one that financially support our child and I have to pay him child support. I pay child support bc I make more. I replied back with that\u2019s not true and even if it was I\u2019m not obligated to provide the family you created by cheating on me while pregnant with a paid in full vacation. My offer stands for you and your son or just you. We leave in a few weeks so I need to know. She doesn\u2019t see her half brother bc courts has fixed a custody agreement to where they get one on one time with dad so the scheduling never laps over. The son\u2019s mom would turn it into courts if my daughter was there during their visitation, she\u2019s threaten to do it so it hasn\u2019t really bother me that they haven\u2019t met. I\u2019ve tried for them to but it\u2019s kind of hard to do when she\u2019s a bitter BM. My daughter is scared of the stepsister (don\u2019t know why) so she\u2019s not allowed around when she\u2019s there (court order due to her being scared of her.). I guess he went posting about it or telling people bc I\u2019ve been getting messages saying I\u2019m a bitch or selfish for not including her bonus family in the vacation. I have informed them that I don\u2019t make enough to pay their way onto the trip and he\u2019s more then welcome to use the child support money that doesn\u2019t even go to our daughter to pay their way. They didn\u2019t know that they were invited and that the issue was money, so he\u2019s making out like they wasn\u2019t invited.

Is he even using the money for that? You\u2019re funding his new family. I wouldn\u2019t.", "I would honestly stop communicating with/involving him with anything other than discussion about your daughter's care. He's taking advantage of you and trying to get a free ride for as much as possible. You take your daughter on a trip, then it's just the two of you. You don't need whatever extra tension/stress/financial strain he brings to it.", "I\u2019m not trying to buy love. I want my child to have a involved father. Never knew that was such a issue tbh.", "Ahh\u2026 well it reads like his 4 year old was with his gf because you never claim to have raised him or have any ties to him.\n\nSo you can see that would have made the ages very much not make sense. \n\nWell in that case NTA. Not your monkeys not your circus", "No it was in good nature all bc she won\u2019t remember in the future doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t ask why dad wasn\u2019t in any pics when she sees them in the future. I try to keep him involved as much as possible so he can\u2019t say I pushed him out. I try to have family vacation of just us and we\u2019ve done it in the pass with no problem. The problem only came after a court order was put against her daughter. I think the fuss is straight bc she knows if he ever does he 50-50 then he\u2019ll must likely have to dump her bc the court order will remain against her daughter.", "Bc I never seen myself as his parent bc his mom would push me out of his life every chance she got even tho I did the 100% of the parenting cause she was either off doing drugs or reproducing another kid while he was at work.", "I\u2019m sorry but HE put your child in danger.\nYou can explain that to your daughter when she asks.", "I mean this in the most respectful way possible, but please have some more self-respect. You are taking care of your daughter by yourself, your ex cheated on you, his partner is meddling with your affairs regarding your child, the stepkid is probably mean to your daughter, and your ex is a deadbeat. \n\nBased on this post, indulging them will not end well for you and your daughter. They will just ask for more and more, and it will never be enough. Your daughter is 1. She cannot stand up for herself so you have to.", "So is he trying to invite the girl to this trip? Because if so, he's attempting to violate it and is therefore, a threat", "I want to confirm, your ex cheated with his previous baby mama while with you being pregnant with his child? He went back to his ex? And that woman doesn't want to be around your child and threatens harm because of it? And allows her daughter (stepsister) to hurt your daughter and doesn't want her son (half brother) to have any interaction with your daughter?", "I'm sorry, how is he going to be able to get 50-50 if he'll be forced to make the stepdaughter leave? Is her father in the picture and does he have 50-50?", "I\u2019m not blaming you, I\u2019m just saying the wording made it seem like that.", "I wish I had an award to give you.", "That is an EXCELLENT point", "He didn\u2019t cheat with his BM. This is a completely different girl. His bm had a scheduled made in court so they don\u2019t overlap bc one on one time and the courts gave in. I\u2019m not mad about it. He\u2019s with a completely different girl that has a little girl that was harming my child somehow that isn\u2019t allowed around her now. She dude gets with women, gets them pregnant, and then dips. He left the first bm when the little boy was a month old.", "But you cannot go with his new family there. There is a court order. If he won\u2019t go without them, then he doesn\u2019t go. I\u2019m surprised you aren\u2019t more angry that he wants to bring your child\u2019s abuser along", "I don\u2019t know anything about the little girl and honestly sounds like his problem. If he ever does get 50-50 I see him having to leave the girl.", "I know I was explaining why I didn\u2019t intell on my pass interactions with his son. I raised the kid more then his own mom but he\u2019s no longer my issues. I just feel bad he won\u2019t get to meet his sister until he\u2019s 18 and away from his crazy mother.", "In all honesty I could probably pull the money together for the rest of them but I just don\u2019t want to for that reason tbh.", "He probably will. You are right that is his problem, but in a way it is also yours since it does concern your daughters safety as she is 1 and unable to actually say what is happening beyond screaming if the girl comes near. But you should definitely address whatever it is your paying him to make sure it's spousal and not child.", "Yeah it sucks when adults are idiots and their kids pay the prize. \n\nBut hey, you did what you could when you could, and you will do everything you can for your own. \nThat\u2019s not something to just dismiss.\nEvery small kindness counts.", "I didn\u2019t mention anything about money. It\u2019s the fact that YOUR CHILDS ABUSER WILL BE THERE!  Why aren\u2019t you taking that more seriously", "My only problem regarding the little girl is her being around my daughter. As long as she\u2019s no where near her I couldn\u2019t careless about her or her mom tbh.", "That\u2019s the reason I will not pay for them. If I don\u2019t pay she can\u2019t go. He will never be able to afford to go to Disney. I could pull the money together so they can go but I won\u2019t due to that fact. Does that make more sense?"]}
