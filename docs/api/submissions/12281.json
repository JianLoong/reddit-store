She\u2019s never been around either of them or met them. I had plan a trip to Disney bc it\u2019s been a hard year and we deserve a treat. I reached out a offer to pay for the expenses of traveling and food for EX/BD and his son, my daughter\u2019s half brother but he would have to pay for Disney for them if he wanted to go. He doesn\u2019t make much that\u2019s why I gave him this offer and I don\u2019t make enough to pay a in full trip for him and his son. If I made enough I would. He has texted me telling me he can\u2019t afford to pay for him and his son to go to Disney. Me not wanting him to miss out on memories with his first daughter I offer to pay for him in full and he just takes time without them to spend time with his first born daughter. He replied back saying that\u2019s not fair bc he brought the idea up to his family (son, step daughter, and gf) and they want to go. I said that\u2019s not my problem and I can\u2019t afford them. That I\u2019m happy to pay the travel expenses and food for him and half brother. He replied back that he knows how much I make and I can pay for all of them no problem, which isn\u2019t true bc I\u2019m the only one that financially support our child and I have to pay him child support. I pay child support bc I make more. I replied back with that\u2019s not true and even if it was I\u2019m not obligated to provide the family you created by cheating on me while pregnant with a paid in full vacation. My offer stands for you and your son or just you. We leave in a few weeks so I need to know. She doesn\u2019t see her half brother bc courts has fixed a custody agreement to where they get one on one time with dad so the scheduling never laps over. The son\u2019s mom would turn it into courts if my daughter was there during their visitation, she\u2019s threaten to do it so it hasn\u2019t really bother me that they haven\u2019t met. I\u2019ve tried for them to but it\u2019s kind of hard to do when she\u2019s a bitter BM. My daughter is scared of the stepsister (don\u2019t know why) so she\u2019s not allowed around when she\u2019s there (court order due to her being scared of her.). I guess he went posting about it or telling people bc I\u2019ve been getting messages saying I\u2019m a bitch or selfish for not including her bonus family in the vacation. I have informed them that I don\u2019t make enough to pay their way onto the trip and he\u2019s more then welcome to use the child support money that doesn\u2019t even go to our daughter to pay their way. They didn\u2019t know that they were invited and that the issue was money, so he\u2019s making out like they wasn\u2019t invited.

They would probably ignore you and go off on their own anyways and are just wanting a free trip to Disney.", "I don't want to say E S H but you're being way too nice. You have a court order for your cheating ex's step daughter to not be around your baby. That's not exactly easy and implies abuse. Why was he allowing this and why does he still get unsupervised visits? I can't believe you're trying to take a family vacation with him and his son. I would be focusing on how to comply with the court order while keeping her safe and not trust your ex so much. \n\nDefinitely rescind the invitation. Your daughter can have a relationship with her half brother but you do not need to facilitate it. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou are not obligated to pay for these people. Your priority is to YOUR child.

As in, not walking, not talking, and definitely won\u2019t remember this experience?\nWhy are you taking a literal baby to Disney when she can\u2019t actually do anything- if money is an issue, go to the zoo or do something you can fully participate in, rather than spending a fortune you walk around and look at rides you can\u2019t go in. Additionally, if there is a court order keeping the step-daughter away from yours, how would such a trip even work? It just doesn\u2019t add up- how does dad propose to even have this vacation if the two girls aren\u2019t allowed near each other- what am I missing?\n\nThat being said, of course you don\u2019t need to pay for your ex\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s kid to come. That\u2019s completely not your responsibility, and beyond a ridiculous ask, so NTA for this. \n\nBut you could solve this by doing something much more age appropriate. I feel like I have to be missing something. You don\u2019t want dad to miss out on her first vacation, so take a vacation doing something he can afford to do.

To be able to spend time with his daughter and his sister? OK, I think that that sounds right, then you informed that you're paying child support because you make more. Oh, ok. Then, he goes and informs his other children about the trip. Then suggests that you pay for everybody because he knows what you make. But YOU just want him to spend time with his daughter? Is this a correct analysis? YTA for even thinking of offering the invitation to him in the first place. To many \"courts\" involved in your house in the first place. Take your precious babygirl to that far away land and let her tell mickey that she's been waiting her whole life to meet him. Girl Bye.

Our social worker was with them during this visit observing my ex her dad. So we assumed the marks came from her.

He\u2019s never been a threat to our child and has always tried his best to protect her.

If she even comes 100ft of her and it\u2019s found out he goes back on supervised permanently. If they find another mark he goes back on supervised permanently.
