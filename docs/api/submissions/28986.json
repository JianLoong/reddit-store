So I, (65M), have one biological son and granddaughter from my first marriage, and one step-daughter and three step-grandchildren from my now wife (67F). My wife and I have been married for about twenty years now, so I have seen all of my step-grandchildren grow up since they were babies and consider them like my own. \n\nMy wife and I recently had the idea to take a family vacation to Mexico (we live in the US), but due to our large family size, we couldn\u2019t afford to pay for everyone ourselves. We invited all of our kids and grandkids but told them that they would have to pay their own way if they wanted to come. I will admit I knew my step-daughter and her kids are in a much better financial situation than my bio son and granddaughter, but I wanted to pitch them the idea regardless so that they could decide if it was something they were willing to splurge on. (My bio granddaughter is 10 so of course her dad would be the one paying for her.)\n\nI gave everyone about a month to decide and my stepdaughter quickly agreed. My son was taking longer to respond, so I would frequently call him and my granddaughter trying to persuade them to come. They eventually declined, saying they really wanted to go but just couldn\u2019t afford to.\n\nMy wife, stepdaughter, step grandchildren, and I all left for Mexico a few months later and had a grand time. We took a bunch of photos and upon returning, I showed them to my son and granddaughter describing all the fun we had and telling them I wish they could have been there. \n\nMy son and granddaughter got quiet and after they had left, my son angrily texted me saying that my granddaughter started crying because she had really wanted to go and that he didn\u2019t appreciate me rubbing the vacation and my favoritism in their faces. I didn\u2019t think I had done anything wrong but now their reactions have me questioning if I\u2019m TA for excluding them from the family trip", "created_utc": 1697401509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178o5vr/aita_for_excluding_my_granddaughter_and_son_from/", "score": 738, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That\u2019s hard enough without you flaunting.", "YTA\n\nNot for going or going with the step family, but for not being sensitive to the fact that your son and granddaughter missed out on the fun due to finances, and then rubbing their faces in all the great times the rest of you had.", "Yta. Also, a months notice?!?! Yeah, you didn\u2019t want them there. Clearly you have a family you want and a family by obligation. You made that situation impossible for your son and did it on purpose.", "YTA If you really wished your son and granddaughter could have been there with you, knowing his financial situation (I'm sure it didn't change all those times you called to check in for the trip), then you should have offered to pay even a part of the cost. Could have called it a gift and had memories with them to last (big asshole move rubbing your fun vacation in their faces, and the comment... Absolutely disgusting).

Did you offer to pay 1st and than your son should pay you back over time? You clearly prefer your step daughter, as you said you knew she was more financially stable.

If you want the family to go on holiday together and pay their own way, you have to choose a destination that everyone can afford.\n\nThen to rub their noses in it, and the \"wish you were with us\" stuff, makes it that much worse.\n\nYou got this wrong. The question is, how will you fix it?", "YTA. Do you even like your bio kids and grandkids? It really doesn\u2019t sound like it.

You suck at this.", "YTA, both for the short term notice and rubbing it in their faces. You could have at least offered to pay for the child. My family elders had this same idea about a Disney World trip. They gave folks six months notice so they could save up. The one sister of mine who wasn\u2019t able to afford it was offered financial assistance from multiple folks in the group because they truly wanted it to be a family experience. See the difference between that and what you did? And to a ten year old. Smh.", "YTA.

And not for \u201cexcluding them\u201d like you ask, but because you shouldn\u2019t of showed them the pictures and told them how much fun your had without first taking their feelings into consideration, especially your granddaughter\u2019s. \n\nShe obviously had no choice to not attend as she couldn\u2019t pay for it herself and her dad couldn\u2019t afford it. To them, it absolutely looks like your rubbing your vacation in their face and showing them what they missed out on. To them, or at least her, it probably also looks like some kind of favoritism. \n\nAnd btw, a month\u2019s notice isn\u2019t much time at all to save up for this kind of vacation!", "YTA - it doesn\u2019t sound like you really wanted them to go.

What kind of person shows photos and gushes about a trip that the other person really wanted to come on but couldn\u2019t afford? That\u2019s an incredibly cruel thing to do.", "YTA, and a crap grandfather. You did rub in her face, and if you can't see that, you're not only a crappy grandfather, but a sh*tty human being.  Shame on you.", "YTA - and worse, you knew that going in. What a jerk", "YTA The whole tone of your post reeks favoritism of your bonus family. Been married x amt of years. My step are financially capable. I\u2019ve known my step for x amount of years. Yet you say my bio son can\u2019t afford. My bio gd is 10. Nothing glowing or favorable about them but just stark facts. It\u2019s like you want everyone to understand your reasoning behind not just paying for your son and gd. Is it favoritism because they literally couldn\u2019t afford it and you helped? If it is then shame on those that CAN afford it and shame on you for being a coward. Sounds like there is more in play here, some kind of history with your son. He is right to feel left out and upset on behalf of your gd. You need to make it right as soon as possible. There may not be a next time to offer him.", "YTA with the emotional intelligence of a child. \n\nYou invited your son and granddaughter and made it clear they had to pay their own way. That was fine. \n\nThey couldn't afford to go. That's also fine. \n\nBut what makes you TA is this:\n>upon returning, I showed them to my son and granddaughter describing all the fun we had and telling them I wish they could have been there.\n\nThat was cruel, thoughtless, and unnecessary. You simply demonstrated how little you care about your son and granddaughter. \n\nDo better.", "YTA, I don't see it as showing favortism, however you did rub this into the faces of not only your son but a 10 yo granddaughter who likely didn't understand the finances of it.  You were showing off, pure and simple.  Great job granddad!", "> My wife and I recently had the idea to take a family vacation to Mexico\n\nWhy didn't you decide to vacation some place everyone could afford? You set the bar arbitrarily high and then said \"tough shit\" to the people who couldn't go.\n\nIn general, I don't think sharing pictures of your vacation would necessarily be \"rubbing it in their faces,\" but given the surrounding context of this situation, I can understand why he'd feel that way. You've definitely created a rift in your family because of this. YTA", "It's not a family vacation since you didn't bring your entire family. It's a trip with people who can afford it.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t \u201cinvite\u201d anyone \u2014 when you invite people, you pay for them. You couldn\u2019t afford to pay for everyone, but you chose not to help your son to be able to join you. Why not? Your stepdaughter\u2019s family paid their own way, so you might have been able to help him at least a little. \n\nThen you rubbed it in his face and his daughter\u2019s face (a 10-year-old kid!) how much fun they\u2019ve missed because they didn\u2019t have the money. Who does something like that?", "YTA for rubbing your vacation in your son\u2019s face.", "YTA", "YTA \n\nSeriously\u2026 you only gave your son that you know is struggling financially, a MONTH to save up for a trip to Mexico?\n\nYou then proceed to bombard both him AND his daughter with calls about a vacation comping up that he probably knew damn well he wouldn\u2019t be able to take her on from the beginning?\n\nThen, once he thinks he\u2019s finally out of the woods you produce surprise photos of all the adventures you did on the trip without them, further reminding them of the luxuries, you and his family have that they don\u2019t, rubbing salt in his daughters wounds, and making him feel even more like shit father then he already was. \n\nMy family is going on vacation in a month to Florida for Thanksgiving. My mother and step dad rented an eight bedroom house for themselves, me, my two siblings, AND my two step siblings (along with my sister Bf, step brothers wife, and two friends of my step sister). Even though the youngest one there will be 27, and even though they are NOT rich by any means, my mom and step dad are still paying for everyone\u2019s accommodations, AND this was planned A YEAR in advanced, because they actually WANTS this to be a real family vacation that everyone can attended. \n\nIf you really wanted this to be a TRUE family vacation you would have given your kids more then just a months notice (ESPECIALLY the one struggling financially), and if you REALLY wanted your son there, you should of at least offered to help pay for his daughter.", "YTA specifically for this:\n\n>upon returning, I showed them to my son and granddaughter describing all the fun we had and telling them I wish they could have been there.\n\nThis is rubbing in the fact that they couldn't afford to go and missed all the fun.", "real r/AmITheDevil material here damn.", "Unless you\u2019re emotionally stunted you knew what you were doing. You at the last minute say let\u2019s take a vacation, give them a month to decide. You admit knowing your steps would be fine and able to afford it.

What a trashy father you are.", "YTA.", "YTA - you knew from the onset your son likely couldn\u2019t afford it (did you consider helping him offset the costs so he could join and help by paying for part of it or loaning the money to pay it off over time?) and then when they retuned you basically said \u201clook at what a fabulous time we had and all the adventures we went on, it\u2019s too bad you couldn\u2019t come\u201d \n\nIt also says a lot that you keep saying you \u201cexcluded\u201d them because this very much implies there was a way you all could have gone on a trip together, be it to somewhere you knew your son could have comfortably afforded or helped out financially in some way or other.", "Wow! Way to remind them that they\u2019re too poor to be involved in family trips. Hey grandaughter look at all the fun your not allowed to join us on because your your single father is struggling financially.  Here\u2019s some pictures to show you all the things we decided to do without you because your dad is poor. I guess you just thought that your son and grandaughter would want all the fun details on the things the entire replacement family enjoyed doing without them.

Your favortism shows in every part of this post, and the sad thing is that it isn't even your own flesh, and blood.  Even your comments show that.  Giving him a month's notice when you know he needs several months in advance notice to take off work, and save up money.  If you gave one iota care about your son, and granddaughter you would have gone on a trip they could afforded to join you on, paid for them to join you, and KEPT THE DAMN PICTURES TO YOURSELF WHEN YOU EXCLUDED THEM FROM THE SO CALLED FAMILY TRIP!

Did your wife see you do this? Is she as lacking in manners as you?", "YTA all the way.  Sometimes I wonder how people can become so blind.  To say you were unkind would be an understatement and to do that to a 10 year old child.  Understand you were not going to pay for the vacation and gave them the chance to participate even knowing their answer.  But you didn\u2019t have to be cruel to a child by showing off what a great time you had with your other grandchild without her.  Do you not love this child or are you just that blind or both.

You didn't exclude him. Everyone that went paid for themselves and he was given the option. But you knew he declined because he couldn't afford it.

There was no need to make it a point to describe the details afterwards to them.", "WTF you think you had done anything wrong. You know they couldn't afford it and they would have liked to attend.

Nobody in their right mind would think a one month heads up is sufficient time, especially if they know someone does not have a lot of discretionary funds available like your son. It\u2019s obvious you favor your stepdaughter over your own biological child.\n\nI feel so horrible for your son\u2019s child. Not only did you purposely exclude them from a trip, knowing it would be financially difficult for them to afford it, but then you had to rub it in their faces after the fact.

One of our fam members loves to announce big trips in front of me, my husband, and my kids them look at us sideways when we say we cannot afford what they are wanting us to do. We\u2019ve been cornered into taking so many vacations we honestly couldn\u2019t afford and it\u2019s put us in such a bind financially. Hubs and I are educators. We aren\u2019t rolling in dough. And yes that was our decision to have those careers. But don\u2019t make us have to be the bad guy in front of our kids when you\u2019re inviting us on something you know we can\u2019t afford.

What the hell is wrong with you?", "YTA.\n\nA month's notice is not much time for someone without a lot of disposable income to budget an expensive trip. \n\nIt also doesn't give enough advance notice for many people to get time off at work for a lengthy trip. \n\nYou organized a family trip that two members of your family lacked the ability to take part in. That isn't great. Even if you couldn't afford to help your son, you could have planned something with more advance notice, so that your son could save the money. You chose to set up a family trip that was impossible for any but the more affluent family members to take part in. Do you knowingly favor your stepchildren, or do you just not care enough to bother trying to behave equitably with all of your children and grandchildren?\n\nWhat truly makes you TA however, is that you rubbed your fun trip and your strong bond with the rest of your family in your son's and especially granddaughter's faces.

It was \u2018too expensive\u2019 to take us so he just dropped the subject completely but sneakily arranged with them.

So I, (65M), have one biological son and granddaughter from my first marriage, and one step-daughter and three step-grandchildren from my now wife (67F). My wife and I have been married for about twenty years now, so I have seen all of my step-grandchildren grow up since they were babies and consider them like my own. \n\nMy wife and I recently had the idea to take a family vacation to Mexico (we live in the US), but due to our large family size, we couldn\u2019t afford to pay for everyone ourselves. We invited all of our kids and grandkids but told them that they would have to pay their own way if they wanted to come. I will admit I knew my step-daughter and her kids are in a much better financial situation than my bio son and granddaughter, but I wanted to pitch them the idea regardless so that they could decide if it was something they were willing to splurge on. (My bio granddaughter is 10 so of course her dad would be the one paying for her.)\n\nI gave everyone about a month to decide and my stepdaughter quickly agreed. My son was taking longer to respond, so I would frequently call him and my granddaughter trying to persuade them to come. They eventually declined, saying they really wanted to go but just couldn\u2019t afford to.\n\nMy wife, stepdaughter, step grandchildren, and I all left for Mexico a few months later and had a grand time. We took a bunch of photos and upon returning, I showed them to my son and granddaughter describing all the fun we had and telling them I wish they could have been there. \n\nMy son and granddaughter got quiet and after they had left, my son angrily texted me saying that my granddaughter started crying because she had really wanted to go and that he didn\u2019t appreciate me rubbing the vacation and my favoritism in their faces. I didn\u2019t think I had done anything wrong but now their reactions have me questioning if I\u2019m TA for excluding them from the family trip\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It's actually even a little funny now, because our fortunes are completely reversed if it was anyone else I would feel bad and try to help, but for her I just can't be bothered to care. Pretty sure OP is going to end up with a similar relationship with his son and granddaughter, so I hope the stepdaughter has already agreed to care for him when he's elderly.", "That's absolutely ridiculous. He was just trying to tell them about the trip. There was no ill intention in doing so at all, that's your twisted interpretation.", "He knew his son was in a tight financial situation and only gave him a month to make a decision. He didn\u2019t want them to go.", "This.\n\nYTA OP. Are you really so tone deaf that you do not understand that showing the photos of you having a grand old time with your other grand children to your 10 year old grand daughter after they had to decline this trip because of financial reasons might have been very hurtful?\n\nFor Pete sake - the girl is a child. Its the equivalent of buying all your other grandkids and ipad and getting her a barbie. She's 10. Not 4. She understands that she was excluded because of their financial constraints - something TOTALLY outside of a 10 year old's control.", "Not disagreeing that OP is TA for what happened after the trip but OP did say he gave them a month to \"decide\" not a month \"notice.\" The OP's story continues to explain that after the about 1 month window to decide, several months later they went on the trip.", "THIS.  When my parents planned a trip overseas and invited my wife and I to come along, they gave us a YEAR notice so we could save up and enjoy the trip.", "Which comment are you referring to? And I wasn\u2019t trying to rub it in their faces, I just wanted to share some photos from the trip like one would usually do.", "Exactly! I treat my friends better than OP treats his 10yr granddaughter. Poor thing.", "Why couldn't he have at least paid for his granddaughter?", "I think that's what OP is secretly hoping.", "He would have had more than a month to save for the trip. I gave him a month to decide if it was something he thought he could and would want to afford.", "100 % Asshole. And clueless, do you even like your son?  Then start acting like it, you really did play favorite as you knew from the beginning the son couldn\u2019t go and the step daughter could.

It wasn't terribly expensive  overall, but it was beyond my budget so I didn't sign on to go. \n\nLater, one couple noticed I wasn't in the planning and asked me why I wasn't going and I told them the truth.  Two days later they asked if it would be okay if they paid for me because they really wanted me to be there too.

One that I'm sure made the pics and stories afterwards worse.\n\nOP didn't just offer once and accept his son's \"No\". OP admited that he spent a month frequently calling and trying to persuade his son to join the trip. As if the repeated calls and \"persuasion\" (hmmm... guilt trips maybe?) would magically make the money appear in his son's budget when he knew budget would be an issue.\n\nI have to wonder how many times and ways OPs son had to say \"No, Dad, I can't afford it.\" before OP actually got the message. Like did it really take the son a month to decide? Or did it just take OP a month to actually listen to his son?\n\nWhats worse is that it sounds like OP wasn't just talking to his son. He mentions trying to persuad his son *and* grandaughter. ie. Trying to get his granddaughter to convince her dad to join the trip. Which is just wrong. Knowing budget was an issue but spending a month going through the grandchild to try to change his kid's mind on this? Wanna bet a lot of the \"persuasion\" to the granddaughter was hyping up how fun the trip would be to get her to try to sell her dad on it?\n\nWhich helps to explain the son and granddaughters reactions when the pictures were shown and the stories were told. Especially the granddaughter crying after leaving. What 10 year old wouldn't cry after granddad spent a month hyping the trip to her and trying to use her to triangulate her dad into going?\n\n\"Rubbing it in their face\" may be a mild description of how she felt at that point.\n\nFor me that month of OP trying to change his son's mind, particularly using the grandaughter, makes it a hard YTA for him.

I wonder why OP seems to dislike them so much.", "Seriously, on point.

Never. We would sometimes take day trips to do fun, simple, not expensive things to nearby places - but never even stayed in a hotel. I think I was probably 14 thr first time I ever stayed in a hotel - and that was when my aunt and uncle took me along on their beach vacation so I could help watch my little cousin (who was 5 at the time). \n\nMeanwhile my OTHER uncle and his family (no where near wealthy, but certainly solidly middle class), whose daughters (my cousins) I was close with (we were much closer in age) would go every year, usually to the beach or Disney. I actually always looked forward to seeing the photos when they got back bc it showed me something I wouldn't have seen otherwise.

It certainly felt very much like 'look at the fun we had, shame your mother couldn't afford for you to go'.", "It is not about intent. It is about how it would be received. At 10 all his granddaughter knows is that she was not a part of the \"family\" vacation.", "Impact supersedes intent. And while he should be able to talk about the trip and tell them stories, it\u2019s probably not the most thoughtful or kind to do it right away, when the granddaughters feelings (a 10 year old child btw) were still raw about missing an awesome family vacation. \n\nBoth things can be true: OP wanted to share with his loved ones and didn\u2019t mean it maliciously and his granddaughter can feel like it was thoughtless and mean to \u201crub it in\u201d. \n\nImpact supersedes intent. OP should just apologize and be slightly more thoughtful in the future. Other peoples feelings matter, even if you don\u2019t understand them", "Disagree.\n\nWhen they took so long to respond with a no, that was a clear indication they wanted to go.\n\nWhen everyone else was able to and they couldn't, and I'm sure son voiced his disappointment and regret because anyone would, that was a clear sign not to rub it in their faces.\n\nMy entire family took a trip to Costa Rica a year ago.

No. Because I'm an adult and I recognize that it's my fault I couldn't go. Did it still sting a bit? Yes.

At that point it was out of his control and if I was her dad I'd be upset too. She's just a kid, she doesn't understand money.
