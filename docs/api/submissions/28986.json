{"id": 28986, "submission_id": "178o5vr", "title": "AITA for excluding my granddaughter and son from a family vacation?", "selftext": "Throwaway. So I, (65M), have one biological son and granddaughter from my first marriage, and one step-daughter and three step-grandchildren from my now wife (67F). My wife and I have been married for about twenty years now, so I have seen all of my step-grandchildren grow up since they were babies and consider them like my own. \n\nMy wife and I recently had the idea to take a family vacation to Mexico (we live in the US), but due to our large family size, we couldn\u2019t afford to pay for everyone ourselves. We invited all of our kids and grandkids but told them that they would have to pay their own way if they wanted to come. I will admit I knew my step-daughter and her kids are in a much better financial situation than my bio son and granddaughter, but I wanted to pitch them the idea regardless so that they could decide if it was something they were willing to splurge on. (My bio granddaughter is 10 so of course her dad would be the one paying for her.)\n\nI gave everyone about a month to decide and my stepdaughter quickly agreed. My son was taking longer to respond, so I would frequently call him and my granddaughter trying to persuade them to come. They eventually declined, saying they really wanted to go but just couldn\u2019t afford to.\n\nMy wife, stepdaughter, step grandchildren, and I all left for Mexico a few months later and had a grand time. We took a bunch of photos and upon returning, I showed them to my son and granddaughter describing all the fun we had and telling them I wish they could have been there. \n\nMy son and granddaughter got quiet and after they had left, my son angrily texted me saying that my granddaughter started crying because she had really wanted to go and that he didn\u2019t appreciate me rubbing the vacation and my favoritism in their faces. I didn\u2019t think I had done anything wrong but now their reactions have me questioning if I\u2019m TA for excluding them from the family trip\n\n   ETA: Okay I get it, I\u2019m TA; Although I don\u2019t appreciate all the comments leaping to make awful assumptions about me and my family based off of 5 paragraphs. I love my son and granddaughter equally to the rest of my family and definitely am not \u201cabandoning\u201d them for my wife and her family. I did cheat on my ex-wife, which was the ultimate cause for our divorce, but given the circumstances we had an amicable split and I happily got to see my son on the weekends. \n\n   I didn\u2019t offer to pay for my son or granddaughter because I wanted to be fair to my stepdaughter who has to foot the bill for herself and her children. That would be playing favorites in my opinion. And my wife and I specifically wanted to go to Mexico, the whole family vacation part did not come to our minds until after we had already decided on the destination spot. \n\n   Also, my son and granddaughter had one month to DECIDE if they wanted/could afford to attend the trip; I did not blindside them a month before the trip was supposed to start. If my son thought it was something he could afford, he would have had 4/5 months to save up for the trip and request off of work.", "created_utc": 1697401509, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178o5vr/aita_for_excluding_my_granddaughter_and_son_from/", "score": 2614, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, a months notice?!?! Yeah, you didn\u2019t want them there. Clearly you have a family you want and a family by obligation. You made that situation impossible for your son and did it on purpose.", "YTA If you really wished your son and granddaughter could have been there with you, knowing his financial situation (I'm sure it didn't change all those times you called to check in for the trip), then you should have offered to pay even a part of the cost.

Sounds like you prefer your second family.", "YTA, I wouldn't be surprised if your Son and Granddaughter would be low contact with you from now on or cut you off entirely.Why did you have to rub it in her face and brag about all the fun you had. Did you offer to pay 1st and than your son should pay you back over time? You clearly prefer your step daughter, as you said you knew she was more financially stable. You chosen a trip knowing your son couldn't afford it with a month's notice 10000% YTA.", "YTA - For not showing any basic emotional understanding. But you only gave the parents a month to decide and plan? Really? You knew they weren't in a great financial situation and you didnt give them time to plan.

If you want the family to go on holiday together and pay their own way, you have to choose a destination that everyone can afford.\n\nThen to rub their noses in it, and the \"wish you were with us\" stuff, makes it that much worse.\n\nYou got this wrong. The question is, how will you fix it?", "YTA. Do you even like your bio kids and grandkids? It really doesn\u2019t sound like it.

You suck at this.", "YTA, both for the short term notice and rubbing it in their faces. You could have at least offered to pay for the child. My family elders had this same idea about a Disney World trip. They gave folks six months notice so they could save up. The one sister of mine who wasn\u2019t able to afford it was offered financial assistance from multiple folks in the group because they truly wanted it to be a family experience. See the difference between that and what you did? And to a ten year old. Smh.", "YTA.

And not for \u201cexcluding them\u201d like you ask, but because you shouldn\u2019t of showed them the pictures and told them how much fun your had without first taking their feelings into consideration, especially your granddaughter\u2019s. \n\nShe obviously had no choice to not attend as she couldn\u2019t pay for it herself and her dad couldn\u2019t afford it. To them, it absolutely looks like your rubbing your vacation in their face and showing them what they missed out on. To them, or at least her, it probably also looks like some kind of favoritism. \n\nAnd btw, a month\u2019s notice isn\u2019t much time at all to save up for this kind of vacation!", "YTA - it doesn\u2019t sound like you really wanted them to go.

What kind of person shows photos and gushes about a trip that the other person really wanted to come on but couldn\u2019t afford? That\u2019s an incredibly cruel thing to do.", "YTA, and a crap grandfather. You did rub in her face, and if you can't see that, you're not only a crappy grandfather, but a sh*tty human being.  Shame on you.", "YTA - and worse, you knew that going in. What a jerk", "YTA The whole tone of your post reeks favoritism of your bonus family. Been married x amt of years. My step are financially capable. I\u2019ve known my step for x amount of years. Yet you say my bio son can\u2019t afford. My bio gd is 10. Nothing glowing or favorable about them but just stark facts. It\u2019s like you want everyone to understand your reasoning behind not just paying for your son and gd. Is it favoritism because they literally couldn\u2019t afford it and you helped? If it is then shame on those that CAN afford it and shame on you for being a coward. Sounds like there is more in play here, some kind of history with your son. He is right to feel left out and upset on behalf of your gd. You need to make it right as soon as possible. There may not be a next time to offer him.", "YTA with the emotional intelligence of a child. \n\nYou invited your son and granddaughter and made it clear they had to pay their own way. That was fine. \n\nThey couldn't afford to go. That's also fine. \n\nBut what makes you TA is this:\n>upon returning, I showed them to my son and granddaughter describing all the fun we had and telling them I wish they could have been there.\n\nThat was cruel, thoughtless, and unnecessary. You simply demonstrated how little you care about your son and granddaughter. \n\nDo better.", "YTA, I don't see it as showing favortism, however you did rub this into the faces of not only your son but a 10 yo granddaughter who likely didn't understand the finances of it.  You were showing off, pure and simple.  Great job granddad!", "> My wife and I recently had the idea to take a family vacation to Mexico\n\nWhy didn't you decide to vacation some place everyone could afford? You set the bar arbitrarily high and then said \"tough shit\" to the people who couldn't go.\n\nIn general, I don't think sharing pictures of your vacation would necessarily be \"rubbing it in their faces,\" but given the surrounding context of this situation, I can understand why he'd feel that way. You've definitely created a rift in your family because of this. YTA", "It's not a family vacation since you didn't bring your entire family. It's a trip with people who can afford it.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t \u201cinvite\u201d anyone \u2014 when you invite people, you pay for them. You couldn\u2019t afford to pay for everyone, but you chose not to help your son to be able to join you. Why not? Your stepdaughter\u2019s family paid their own way, so you might have been able to help him at least a little. \n\nThen you rubbed it in his face and his daughter\u2019s face (a 10-year-old kid!) how much fun they\u2019ve missed because they didn\u2019t have the money. Who does something like that?", "YTA for rubbing your vacation in your son\u2019s face.", "YTA", "YTA \n\nSeriously\u2026 you only gave your son that you know is struggling financially, a MONTH to save up for a trip to Mexico?\n\nYou then proceed to bombard both him AND his daughter with calls about a vacation comping up that he probably knew damn well he wouldn\u2019t be able to take her on from the beginning?\n\nThen, once he thinks he\u2019s finally out of the woods you produce surprise photos of all the adventures you did on the trip without them, further reminding them of the luxuries, you and his family have that they don\u2019t, rubbing salt in his daughters wounds, and making him feel even more like shit father then he already was. \n\nMy family is going on vacation in a month to Florida for Thanksgiving. My mother and step dad rented an eight bedroom house for themselves, me, my two siblings, AND my two step siblings (along with my sister Bf, step brothers wife, and two friends of my step sister). Even though the youngest one there will be 27, and even though they are NOT rich by any means, my mom and step dad are still paying for everyone\u2019s accommodations, AND this was planned A YEAR in advanced, because they actually WANTS this to be a real family vacation that everyone can attended. \n\nIf you really wanted this to be a TRUE family vacation you would have given your kids more then just a months notice (ESPECIALLY the one struggling financially), and if you REALLY wanted your son there, you should of at least offered to help pay for his daughter.", "YTA specifically for this:\n\n>upon returning, I showed them to my son and granddaughter describing all the fun we had and telling them I wish they could have been there.\n\nThis is rubbing in the fact that they couldn't afford to go and missed all the fun.", "real r/AmITheDevil material here damn.", "Unless you\u2019re emotionally stunted you knew what you were doing. You at the last minute say let\u2019s take a vacation, give them a month to decide. You admit knowing your steps would be fine and able to afford it.

Everyone was able to make their own financially responsible decisions. no favoritism there.\n\nShowing off the pictures, unless you were asked by them or someone at a gathering to see them, was an AH move though.

Way to remind them that they\u2019re too poor to be involved in family trips. Hey grandaughter look at all the fun your not allowed to join us on because your your single father is struggling financially.

Your favortism shows in every part of this post, and the sad thing is that it isn't even your own flesh, and blood.  Even your comments show that.  Giving him a month's notice when you know he needs several months in advance notice to take off work, and save up money.  If you gave one iota care about your son, and granddaughter you would have gone on a trip they could afforded to join you on, paid for them to join you, and KEPT THE DAMN PICTURES TO YOURSELF WHEN YOU EXCLUDED THEM FROM THE SO CALLED FAMILY TRIP!

Did your wife see you do this? Is she as lacking in manners as you?", "YTA all the way.  Sometimes I wonder how people can become so blind.  To say you were unkind would be an understatement and to do that to a 10 year old child.  Understand you were not going to pay for the vacation and gave them the chance to participate even knowing their answer.  But you didn\u2019t have to be cruel to a child by showing off what a great time you had with your other grandchild without her.  Do you not love this child or are you just that blind or both.

Being the one in our family who can\u2019t afford things like this, it makes my blood boil. One of our fam members loves to announce big trips in front of me, my husband, and my kids them look at us sideways when we say we cannot afford what they are wanting us to do. We\u2019ve been cornered into taking so many vacations we honestly couldn\u2019t afford and it\u2019s put us in such a bind financially. Hubs and I are educators. We aren\u2019t rolling in dough. And yes that was our decision to have those careers. But don\u2019t make us have to be the bad guy in front of our kids when you\u2019re inviting us on something you know we can\u2019t afford.

What the hell is wrong with you?", "YTA.\n\nA month's notice is not much time for someone without a lot of disposable income to budget an expensive trip. \n\nIt also doesn't give enough advance notice for many people to get time off at work for a lengthy trip. \n\nYou organized a family trip that two members of your family lacked the ability to take part in. That isn't great. Even if you couldn't afford to help your son, you could have planned something with more advance notice, so that your son could save the money. You chose to set up a family trip that was impossible for any but the more affluent family members to take part in. Do you knowingly favor your stepchildren, or do you just not care enough to bother trying to behave equitably with all of your children and grandchildren?\n\nWhat truly makes you TA however, is that you rubbed your fun trip and your strong bond with the rest of your family in your son's and especially granddaughter's faces.

So I, (65M), have one biological son and granddaughter from my first marriage, and one step-daughter and three step-grandchildren from my now wife (67F). My wife and I have been married for about twenty years now, so I have seen all of my step-grandchildren grow up since they were babies and consider them like my own. \n\nMy wife and I recently had the idea to take a family vacation to Mexico (we live in the US), but due to our large family size, we couldn\u2019t afford to pay for everyone ourselves. We invited all of our kids and grandkids but told them that they would have to pay their own way if they wanted to come. I will admit I knew my step-daughter and her kids are in a much better financial situation than my bio son and granddaughter, but I wanted to pitch them the idea regardless so that they could decide if it was something they were willing to splurge on. (My bio granddaughter is 10 so of course her dad would be the one paying for her.)\n\nI gave everyone about a month to decide and my stepdaughter quickly agreed. My son was taking longer to respond, so I would frequently call him and my granddaughter trying to persuade them to come. They eventually declined, saying they really wanted to go but just couldn\u2019t afford to.\n\nMy wife, stepdaughter, step grandchildren, and I all left for Mexico a few months later and had a grand time. We took a bunch of photos and upon returning, I showed them to my son and granddaughter describing all the fun we had and telling them I wish they could have been there. \n\nMy son and granddaughter got quiet and after they had left, my son angrily texted me saying that my granddaughter started crying because she had really wanted to go and that he didn\u2019t appreciate me rubbing the vacation and my favoritism in their faces. I didn\u2019t think I had done anything wrong but now their reactions have me questioning if I\u2019m TA for excluding them from the family trip\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

And how many times has he basically done this to his son and granddaughter before it was enough for them.", "YTA.\n\nYou favourite step children over your own children, you are a nasty piece of work, really.", "I know everyone is going to disagree with me (since the majority say OP was AH), but here goes. NTA. Have to look at both sides.\n\n1st- OP can't afford to pay for everyone, so gave them a choice to go or not. It is NOT OP's fault that his bio family can't afford to go. This is a vacation that HE and HIS wife wanted to go and asked if anyone wants to join, the more the merrier. He didn't pay for his steps. Some people said that OP should've offer to pay for bio granddaughter - if he did and didn't buy everyone else, then he would be the AT and playing favoritism. You can't pay for 1 and not the others. Some will say but steps were able to afford it.  Yes, but just because you can afford something doesn't mean you don't want it for free. \n\n2nd-  We have been on vacation with my oldest only and on vacation with my youngest only. I show pictures of our different vacations to each of them and wish that everyone could come with. Sometimes it doesn't work that way. OP had fun and was happy to show pictures without any evil intent! Maybe OP could plan another vacation close by (or somewhere not too expensive) where his bio family can come and not the steps. Who is to say that family vacations have to include everyone??!! Schedules, finances, etc can be the cause of people not being able to go. So should he have cancelled his vacation just because his bio couldn't go?You can have separate memories of each other.  Yes he would be the AH if this was a recurring thing, but it didn't sound like it. I'm sure OP and his bio have some great memories of themselves together. There have been times where some of my sisters's family go on vacations together and I couldn't. Yes I was jealous (because it looked fun), but not mad. They had  fun and I was happy for them.\n\nThe only thing is (where I think OP was wrong), unless bio wanted to see pictures, OP should've waited a while before showing them. Children are very sensitive and opinionated and can get easily hurt/jealous. So no, NTA to his question of excluding bio family. He was not excluding them - he invited them but unfortunately they couldn't afford to go.", "NTA. You made a plan and invited them. OP couldn't afford to pay for them, or they would have, it sounds like to me. And then if he could have afforded it, what then? Pay for one kid and not the other and guess who's the asshole again? \n\nHonestly? It's okay for a 10-year-old to understand that some families have more money than others, and that really isn't the end of the world. You shouldn't be expected to act like the vacation didn't happen.\n\nAnd by the way, I'm saying this as the mom in a family unit who often can't afford to go on the family vacation. And I have young kids, too. You don't stifle someone else's joy because you can't have what they did. It's okay. If grandma wants to come over and show pictures and talk about what fun it was, you can bet I'm going to be happy they had a great time. And honestly, my kids are okay too. \n\nIf you can swing it, do something else fun with your son and grand as a treat. An overnight in a nearby city or something.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the AH. \n\nCould\u2019ve been a little more considerate of the grand daughters feelings if she\u2019s sensitive but you offered for them to come and they said they couldn\u2019t. That\u2019s not your fault. \n\nYou had a great time and wanted to show them how much fun you had. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable. It\u2019d be different if you had ill intentions, then yeah you\u2019re an ass. But the way you described I got the sense that it was like a \u201cwe had a great time, hopefully next time we can plan ahead for y\u2019all to join us as well\u201d kind of thing. That\u2019s just me. NTA", "LOL, YTA. Are you like 16 YO??\n\nMy first SIL comes over to our house and tells me that the 2nd SIL's son is getting married and they are flying over to attend the marriage ceremony. We weren't even informed of the marriage ceremony occurring so I was absolutely shocked and very upset (where I come from, this would NEVER happen amongst family members). Fast forward 3 months, the first SIL comes over to our house and shows all the pics of wedding and tells us how glorious the wedding was & how wonderful the country was, etc (FYI, we have enough money to travel to any foreign country and we are most well off amongst siblings in the family so money is not the issue). While she was talking, I realized I didn't have time for these dumb idiots. I stood up and started doing laundry and let her talk to my hubby and I generally ignored her during her rest of the stay at our house. \n\nAfter they left, I told my hubby, how Strange his 2nd SIL was (in her mid-50's) and how dumb and thoughtless his first SIL was....what is wrong with these people! I decided I have had enough of these BS (too much heartburn just talking to these people) and declined to host them whenever they tried to invite themselves over to our house (another dumb things they kept doing).\n\nOne day the first SIL sent me a hand written letter asking me WHY I was upset with them and that they missed spending time with us. Since she took some efforts to write me a letter, I called her and told her how her sister hurt my feelings and her coming back from the wedding (which we weren't even informed of!! Let alone invited to) she hurt my feelings even more, it was like rubbing salt on the wounds. I asked her, have you EVER heard of White Lie?  You should have lied to me saying it was nothing special, you didn't miss a thing, you saved a bunch of money by not travelling!! or Not talk about the whole affair at all. How are you almost 60 YO and Not know this??!!", "You have the \u201cthrow the first family away\u201d syndrome \n\nPerhaps not as severely as men who abandon the family completely but you have the attitude and it shows.

I understand why the son and grand daughter are upset, but I think the OP should be able to choose to go on holiday regardless of the circumstances of his son.", "These redditors are embarrassing, acting like you \"forgot your biological children.\" Don't worry about the judgments from kids and morons from this subreddit. You son is old enough to not be pouting because he couldn't go on a lucrative vacation.", "NTA", "NTA. \n\nMy parents frequently go to Mexico for vacation and have asked me and my daughter to go with them in the past with less of a time line to make a decision with it being months in advance and I can\u2019t afford it so I had to decline. They on the other hand Pay for my brother to come along with them. When they come back and show me all the pictures of them having fun I love to see it and so does my daughter and yes she always wants to go but I explain to her that it\u2019s just something we can\u2019t afford and that we can make it a plan for the future and that makes her happy enough to not dwell on it. So I\u2019m my perspective I don\u2019t see anything wrong with you wanting to show your son and granddaughter what a fun time you guys had. Not everyone can be included in everything and shouldn\u2019t get upset cause you wanted to share the fun you had.", "NTA. The topic of the vacation was eventually going to come up so were you and all the other family members who went on the trip expected to take the memories to your graves and never speak on it?

They decided not to be there. They couldn't afford it. That's how life goes.", "NTA. I don\u2019t know why everyone\u2019s getting so angry and hostile about this. They couldn\u2019t afford to come.

They could have paid like everyone else.", "Sorry, but I'm saying NTA. \n\nOP gave both children the same amount of time to decide on this, so I have no idea why this is being called favouritism. It's understandable that a kid might feel upset for missing out on something, and not get the concept of money and how much things cost. It's also understandable that someone might want to show off their holiday pics. Perhaps OP could have been a bit more empathetic about it, but that's the only AH move IMO. It's not OP's fault that his son can't afford something. \n\nHowever, OP, next time, if you have to plan something with such short notice that your son can't attend, try planning for a future holiday at the same time. Like maybe go to mexico now, but we're planning to go to Fiji next year which gives your son time to save up, and still make them feel included.", "NTA.
