While they will be making some food, the whole family is bringing side dishes, appetizers, desserts, drinks, etc\u2026. They had never hosted an holiday gathering before and were excited to have everyone over. Everything is going smoothly. \n\nFast forward to Tuesday at 8:30pm. My brother sends myself, sister and brother a text indicating that their house is not healthy. Their daughter has the flu, their son was \u2018starting to take a turn\u2019 and he and his wife have been coughing.  He then asks if they can postpone Thanksgiving dinner to Friday or Saturday to give them a chance to recover. He said that they would still like to host so if keeping it on Thursday is that important to everyone they will make it work. Then he says that he will see how the kiddos at in the morning, but \u201cit isn\u2019t looking good\u201d.  \n\nMy siblings and I have jammed packed weekends ourselves  (visiting other family (in-laws), friends, getting Christmas trees, decorating, etc).  So we start texting him back questions immediately (how sick are you guys?, which day were you thinking of postponing?) to figure out how we can re-arrange our schedules to make it work and to come up with alternate plans for our families on Thanksgiving day if they decide to postpone. He completely ghosted us.\n\nThe Wednesday morning I send another text asking how everyone is feeling and are you postponing?  I got nothing. I sent another text letting him know that it is OK if they want to cancel, the main thing is that they get healthy and we keeps our kids healthy. Still nothing.\n\nSo my sister and I collaborate and decide get an alternate plan started.  We find a pre-cooked turkey (which could be frozen if need be) and buy food to make on Thanksgiving so we don\u2019t have to eat hot dogs because we waited too long for a response from my  brother.  We went into action because we knew that as the day went on it would be harder to find a turkey.  We fully expected to cook for our families on Thanksgiving Day and repeat the same dinner at my brother\u2019s the next day or two if necessary.\n\nWe finally get a text about 3 hours later indicating that they spent a lot of effort and money into hosting and they are still having it. If we are worried about getting sick, don\u2019t come. (Still no indication of they decided to postpone).  \n\nThen he picked up a phone and told me and my sister how dare we go behind his back and plan our own thing. He called us both offensive, rude and selfish.  We both told him that we were still planned to come over if postponed and bringing what we were suppose to bring. But we wanted to ensure that our own families had a Thanksgiving dinner on Thanksgiving Day.  We were totally prepared to eat the same dinner 2 days in a row.  Didn\u2019t matter - we were still offensive and selfish people. \n\nAITA for having alternate plans in place for my family on Thanksgiving Day?", "created_utc": 1669299275, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z3l19i/aita_for_having_alternate_thanksgiving_dinner/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
