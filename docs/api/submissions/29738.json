After the first two weeks, I decided to upgrade to a full size mattress (the twin xl was comfortable but I wanted something bigger). I was planning to sell the twin xl since I\u2019d barely used it, until my brother came over last week.\n\nHe saw the mattress and asked what I was going to do with it. I told him I was planning to list it on fb marketplace to try and get some of the money back. He told me he needed one and asked me if I\u2019d consider giving it to him. He\u2019s fresh out of college, brand new to the city, and strapped for cash. I agreed without hesitation because he\u2019s my little brother and I didn\u2019t want him sleeping on the floor.\n\nI went to see his new place for the first time yesterday and he gave me a little tour. When we entered the bedroom, I expected to see a bed\u2026only to see a sleeping bag in the corner and the mattress dismembered on the floor instead. I asked him what happened and in the most laid back manner he told me that he was planning to hollow it out and cut it up to use as a Halloween costume but found it to be too difficult and gave up.\n\nI was furious. His defense was that I never said what he could and couldn\u2019t do with it when I gifted it to him, but I feel like it\u2019s not crazy to assume someone is going to use an almost new mattress to sleep? He also said \"it's not like you're poor and need the money from a used twin mattress\" which is true, but for me the main issue is the needless waste. I'd have donated it over letting it get destroyed. He didn\u2019t even end up using it for the costume.\n\nI\u2019d gotten us tickets to see his favorite band next month but told him I\u2019m going to sell them or go with someone else. That made him very upset and he told my parents I punished him. They're now telling me I'm being cruel over a harmless mistake. They also said that even if I'd sold the mattress, that person could've done the same thing and I'd have no right to control them once they own it. Even my girlfriend thinks I\u2019m being too harsh on him and at this point I\u2019m not sure.", "created_utc": 1698355646, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17h75xx/aita_for_punishing_my_brother_for_what_he_did_to/", "score": 92, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I punished my brother by revoking concert tickets after he destroyed a mattress I gave him. 2. He wasn't being malicious, and it was technically his property to do what he wants with.

You specifically gave it to your brother instead of selling to because you thought he *needed* it. Like actually needed it for sleep. If you\u2019d know he was going to destroy it you would have sold it!\n\nYour family sounds like a very ungrateful, thankless group of super entitled jerks if this is their perspective. Being unable to recognize the clear intent behind an action is worrying.", "NTA. If you never physically have him a ticket, then it was never his anyway. Plus, WHAT HE DID TO THE FUCKING MATTRESS.", "NTA \n\nThere are people without beds and he ruined a perfectly good mattress. \n\nWho does that?", "Nta\n\nYou gave it to him to ease a potential financial burden, and you did it while also forgoing your own attempt to recoup your own losses. You didn't give it to him to be a part of a costume that he then gave up on. Not wanting to reward him in that light makes sense; he might use the tickets to blow his nose or something and you'd be out of money for that too.", "NTA - your parents are right that the people you sold it to may have done the same thing to it.  \nBut the difference once someone actually pays you money for something they can do what they want with it.  \nYour brother didn\u2019t pay for it and made it seem like he needed it to sleep on", "NTA, he wasted a perfectly good mattress\u2026 you could\u2019ve made some money back or donated it to someone who actually needs one. Mattresses are hella expensive\u2026", "NTA  He is.  IGNORE your family", "NtA, it's imperative you punish this type of stupid", "NTA. He should have been transparent with you about what he wanted it for. He made a conscious choice not to tell you, so unless he\u2019s just completely clueless, he probably already knew you might not agree to it. Hopefully he\u2019ll come to understand why you got so pissed. It\u2019s totally understandable to feel he doesn\u2019t deserve those birthday tickets anymore. But, he is your brother and you seem to care about him\u2014 so, once your anger subsides a bit, you should probably spend some time thinking over how you can iron things out\nEdit: typos", "Nta \nI would say lower your expectations of your brother. He lives in his own world with his own code. He is also a quitter, gave up because it got too hard and didn\u2019t clean up his mess left his murdered mattress laying there. \nAlso next time he asks for something make sure you both understand the ask and the strings and expectations attached to the get. \nHe sounds immature and your parents enable that. That he ran to tattle on you to them show that. As did them taking his side. He is also entitled thinking he can determine if you have enough money to lose on a mattress and then pay for concert plus I am assuming all the other costs that going to a concert includes. \nI\u2019d just tell him that it annoyed you that he basically wasted your money. Money you earned. You could have donated it to someone that needed it or sold it and put money back in your pocket. Then after ruining it he didn\u2019t even have the follow through to use it for that purpose cause it wasn\u2019t as easy as he would have liked.  You get that it is no big deal too him but you have different values. Be clear that then to top that off he went running to mommy and daddy to tattle on you. All of it is just not cool to you.\nTell him you aren\u2019t punishing him you just don\u2019t want to waste more of the money you earn going to a concert with him because right now you won\u2019t enjoy it. Plus You\u2019ll be thinking about how he\u2019ll go running to mommy and daddy again if you do something at concert he doesn\u2019t like. \nHonestly down the road if he grows up you\u2019ll both end up laughing about this. Right now though given that your parents aren\u2019t doing him any favors and he has no respect for others money or view points you are doing him a favor by not acting like he can do act however he like without consequences and his parents big brother will just bend over for him.", "NTA\n\nIf he wants the option to destroy it, he needed to pay for it.  Of course giving it to him because he doesn't have one carries the implication he'll be sleeping on it.\n\nIf you bought the tickets, do with them what you will, maybe recoup some costs.  Or if he wants to go, he can pay you the cost of the ticket or the mattress, whichever is higher.", "I won't give a judgement I'm torn here. I'm leaning towards not an AH but\n\nYou gave it to your brother and your family are right with that it was your brothers property and it's not your job to parent him and you also cannot control what he does or doesn't do with his property. If you sold the mattress and the person buying it would do the same you can also not punish this person. The only difference basically is if you sold it you'd never known if the mattress would have been destroyed. Soo you just have to suck it up.... \n\nOn the other hand I hate meaningless destruction and waste too. And your brother knew you initially wanted to sell it to get some of the money back. So he basically asked for a valuable thing from you as a gift. And if you're new in town, don't have money or furniture and ask for a brand-new mattress NOBODY would expect you want it to just destroy it. Plus if you receive a gift as nice gesture people sort of expect you apreciate this gift and treat said gift accordingly. So WTF??? \n\nAnd your parents reaction tells me a bit why your brother is the way he is. They are enabling him and his unreasonable behaviour. If I did such a thing at young age my parents would've been livid! \n\nWho in the world prefers to sleep on the floor all year round so you can have a costume for an evening? Who? What kind of parents excuse such behaviour? \n\nAnd you trying to sell it and your brother destroying good stuff because of a nonsense idea (that didn't even work FFS - what a suprise) tells me why *you* have money and *he* doesn't. Because you know a dollars worth and somehow your parents missed to teach him this exact lesson. \n\nSo yeah technically you're an AH. Practically you're a good sibling and it's probably good intentions you want to teach him a life lesson. I am only afraid it'll be pointless. He most likely will not get it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Will cry a sob story about difficulties or hardships so they can get stuff and then turn around and sell it or use it not for the item's intended purpose.
