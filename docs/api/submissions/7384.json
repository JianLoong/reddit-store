And after your difficult upbringing, no one sane could judge you badly for not wanting to raise your younger siblings.\n\nBut the family calling you names are probably adults so, why not respond them they can look after the children if they think it's a family duty?\n\nSorry for this difficult situation.", "Nta \u201cI can\u2019t financially provide for the wellbeing of my dependent siblings. So who else in the family is taking them?\u201d", "NTA\n\nI question if this extended family are actually people you need in your life.  They stand by your mother, after her years of neglecting and abusing her kids?  It sounds like you have a lot of family that don't do much but serve as a further burden to you.\n\nRegardless, as is always the answer in these posts that end in \"they went to social media to complain about me and now everyone is saying I am the AH\" - if your relatives feel like it is an AH move to not take in these kids, then they are welcome to open their own doors to them.\n\nYou have already raised your first set of siblings when you were a child yourself.  You were lucky to get out of that situation with any mental health at all.  The fact that you are not financially or mentally equipped to raise more of your mother's children is not your fault.  It's simply a fact.  And your mother needs to know that she needs to make alternative plans for her younger children.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA you were already forced to look after her kids. All be damned if she tries to force it on her again.", "NTA for telling her she shouldn't expect you and your adult siblings to raise her kids, although lecturing her about keeping having kids after you grew up may be.\n\nFor all the people saying that OP should have just let their mother think the adult children would raise the young children, that's not a good idea. Waiting for her to die and then sort things out while everyone's still grieving is not a good plan. Waiting for her to die and then dumping the kids into the foster system is not a good plan.\n\nYour mother is being TA for ranting about you on social media. I understand she's upset, but that's what private conversations are for. The mature thing to do would be to go through the extended family tree(s) and try to figure out who would be appropriate to ask if they want to adopt the kids. If the adult siblings don't have the mental or financial ability to care for her kids, does she really want her young children raised under those circumstances?", "NTA\n\nYour mother needs to ask, not assume, expect or demand things of you and your older siblings.  Not that it matters, but where are the younger kid's fathers?", "NTA- your mother absolutely should not expect this", "NTA. And tell extender family they\u2019re on the hook.", "Why can't people have just 1 or 2, 3 max, and call it. I also don't get it if you're so financially unstable why would you be baby factory?!", "NTA, her children, her problem. Yes if they end up on the street you'd kinda be an A not to help... but she is the A that put children into this world with no way to care for them...\n\nIf your extended family is so outraged over this, they can take care of the children themselves instead of being social media keyboard warriors!", "This to me sounds like you have been through hell with your mom. So right now: NTA. She needed to know if you won\u2019t take custody. \n\nThat being said- if your mother has a history of abuse and neglect- and it looks like she is terminal- if I were you I would get together with my adult sibs and look at what the options are for these kids. Figure out how you will coordinate navigating getting these kids settled where they will land. This loss, if it happens, is going to fuck up these kids. That is a given. And if you guys don\u2019t have it in you to raise them- you don\u2019t. And there is no shame in that.\n\nBut when I worked in the foster and emergency shelter care system- and I saw some shit that really broke me. you guys being adult presences in their lives, checking in on them, giving them a sense of family as fractured as it will be- just the consistency- could be the difference between them surviving the system or being swallowed by it. So- I encourage you guys to think about what you can do if the worst happens. Because your mom won\u2019t. And these kids don\u2019t deserve that. They are going to lose their mom, their home, likely their schools, and each other. \n\nMost child welfare systems will look to the dads first, then the adult siblings, then extended family- aunts, cousins- and so on. Then foster families where they will try to keep the kids together- but likely won\u2019t have the capacity to. \n\nI hope you can band together and figure out a way to keep these kids lives as intact as possible with people who love them.", "Info: did you have permission from your siblings to speak on behalf of all of you?", "How many school aged kids are we talking here?", "NTA.\n\nTheir father's should step up to raise and provide for them.\n\nI'd rationally (but kindly) respond to her online rants. \n\nAlso volunteer the services of any any extended family member who speaks up.", "NTA they aren't your responsibility AT ALL. You can freely and without guilt choose not to adopt your mother young children. \n\nRule of thumb is never have children you can't provide for, that majorly applies to you mother!

They simply aren't your responsibility.", "Let the extended family keep them", "NTA.  There is a big difference between being a supportive  older sister and being the primary caregiver for several younger half siblings. The extended family who are complaining about you probably don't want to take on this responsibility either. \n\nAny chance that your mother has an estate that includes a fully paid for home and living expenses, funds to pay for childcare while you work, her own pre paid funeral expenses, and fully funded college funds for the kiddos ?  If she did, at least that would lessen the huge financial burden that she was planning on adding to your plate.", "NTA", "NTA but I would suggest changing your statement from \"us\" to \"me.\" Your siblings are adults who can speak for themselves.

I would like to address point #1, hoping that my own recent experience may be helpful to OP.\n\nYou do not owe your mother a grand state funeral. She's not Queen Elizabeth. As with weddings, funerals are prone to massive mark-ups and overcharging. When my mother passed away, I had her cremated. This was according to her wishes, not for financial reasons. However, it was also the wiser choice financially (and ecologically). This was in 2021, in the midwestern US, and it cost me about $3500 for a standard basic cremation at a normal, well-known funeral home (not some shifty weird place). They may make some attempt to upsell you, but you can decline. You don't need to pay for a service hosted by the funeral home, you can hold your own family gathering if you want to. You don't need an urn --the ashes will come in a container. I chose to buy a pottery vase with a lid to keep the ashes in temporarily, but I didn't buy it from the funeral home --I got it at my mother's favorite handicraft store, and I only did it because there was going to be a significant delay before family and friends could gather for the ashes scattering ceremony. It might not have even been necessary if I had been able to deal with the ashes right away. You don't need a burial plot --you can scatter the ashes for free, at some location that has meaning for your family. (There may be some regulations/permission required, depending on what location you choose.) You said that you have 4 other adult siblings, so for the five of you that would be $700 each.
