If not, it's a bit of an E S H.  The other factor is how your finances are handled.  If you have separate finances, just a shared pot for bills, and you saved up for your car with just your money, then it's definitely your car.  Personally, I'd say the same even if you have completely shared finances but I could see some argument that the car should be more communal property at that point.\n\nIf there are some circumstances where driving your car is better (e.g. yours has better visibility and safety features and she needs to drive on the freeway) then yeah, she should use your car if you don't need it but \"your car is shinier and prettier and has that new car smell\" isn't a good reason for her to dictate when you get to use your own car.", "NTA, but please tell me that whenever tells you when she's going to drive to car you don't just let her walk all over you.", "NTA.

It's still a soft YTA for me. You're married, it's nice to act that way. Also, newer cars generally have more/better safety features, so that translates to her safety too.\n\nI will say that you do hold more stake in the car technically, so if we're talking days that you will be using it, work, etc., you're entitled to it.

I do get it.", ">Why should he consult when the new car was bought using almost all pre-marital assets?\n\nBecause he's married, and he did use some of their shared money for the purchase. Even if the majority of it was premarital money, it is a bit weird to make a large purchase like a vehicle and not include your spouse in the decision making process. It also kind of doesn't matter that he used premarital assets, because in most states it's going to be recognized as marital property because it was purchased while they were married.\n\n>She's getting a better car for free. Why do the years matter when she is getting an upgrade at no cost from his family (and could presumably sell her beater)?\n\nIt matters because the upgrade might not be that significant, and it's also an upgrade she doesn't have a choice in. OP went out and bought a car he chose for himself and himself only. His wife is upgrading from a beater to a car given to her by free (which makes me think it's more than four years old and nowhere near as nice as OP's new car).\n\nI don't know how other people feel about things like this, but I personally wouldn't spend a significant amount of money to get myself a new car that my SO can't drive and then let them putter around in something significantly older and less safe. I'd definitely share the car.\n\nEDIT: Also, you can purchase two 2019 sedans for around 26k, give or take depending on mileage and area. That's not a bad trade in at all considering OP got only one 2019 car for the same price. That makes me think he likely bought a larger car or sports car for himself, while his wife is currently driving a beater.", "You've got yourself an agreement! Lol      \n\nPretty much anything craft-related is off limits to my husband, and pretty much anything computer-related is off limits to me.
