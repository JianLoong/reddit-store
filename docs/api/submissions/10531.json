You are asking the wrong question.  You shouldn't be asking if you should use your funds to pay off his debt.  You should be asking if you should marry a guy with a lot of credit card debt.  The answer is NO.  Even if he manages to pay off the debt himself.  You two are not on the same page, financially speaking.  Might as well put a divorce lawyer on retainer before you get married...", "NTA. His CC debt is his. I've almost left my wife over her CC debt (she got a CC and maxed it out without telling me once or twice while I was the only one providing income..) so I recommend you don't get involved in a situation where somebody else's CC debt is your responsibility.", "NTA, this does sound sketchy, nothing stops him divorcing you. It's not joint debt, it's solo debt.", "NTA ...he should pay off his own credit card debt before you get married OP. You also should find out what other debt he has like student loans, pay day loans, collections etc if you haven't already. You will not have any income for 3 months but it sounds like your bf is still expecting you to pay half the share of the bills. Possibly you still need to discuss finances and spending habits.

He needs to pay for his bad decisions.\n\nNTA.", "He is irresponsible to have so much CC debt. What else is he irresponsible with? He has questionable judgment.

I suggest you postpone marriage or moving until after he has made concrete attempts to start paying off his debt and proving to you he won't be a continual drain once you have shared finances.\n\nOffering to help pay off his debt (not do all of it) ONCE you are working again and have a stable income would make more sense, especially if he earns that help by supporting you during the 3 months you can't work.", "NTA. He's been dishonest about his debt and now he wants you to go into debt to fix his financial issues. He's telling you his debts will be yours, but do you want them to be?\n\nBefore you do *anything* else and before you move into his home, talk to a lawyer, preferably one that has experience with US family law. Discuss if it is possible to draft a prenup where debts/assets accrued before the marriage can be held separate to joint marital assets.

Please don\u2019t let him convince you to use your nest egg to pay off his debt. This is a terrible idea. His debt will become your debt? Seriously? Have you discussed joint finances? His plan to pay down as much of his debt as possible before then? You\u2019ll be living off your savings until you get a job but at the same time you\u2019ll pay down his debt?

Because you should run.", "What exactly is he bringing to this relationship? \n\nI\u2019m really curious. There seems to be a lot of support and moving countries from you - but paying off his bills, and taking care of yourself - all seems to be on you??\n\nNTA - but I\u2019d really think this through", "Honestly, a large amount of CC debt is a pretty big red flag for your future. His expectation that you would simply eliminate the debt on his behalf, and trying to pressure you into doing so is an even bigger red flag.\n\nThey aren\u2019t necessarily deal breakers. I don\u2019t know the situation, why he has the debt, how recent the debt is, if he\u2019s still using ccs to pay for many things and still racking up large amounts of debt, how he treats you otherwise, etc. I\u2019d suggest you ask him more questions about that debt and his current practices (unless you already know the answers) before you go forward with the marriage.\n\nCC debt is much different than bringing in a car loan, student loans, mortgage, etc into a marriage. One shows uncontrolled and un budgeted spending habits, which is a sign of poor financial practices and doesn\u2019t speak well for your future finances, while the others are much more standard parts of modern life (but even those should be talked about honestly with a future spouse).\n\nNTA.", "NTA, not even close. \n\nHe lied to you about his debt becoming your debt, too.  You are not responsible for any debt he acquired before your marriage and even then, you can set a pre-nup stating all finances are separate and each is responsible for their own debt during the marriage.  His lie, to me, indicates he's trying to trick/scare you into paying his bills by implying it becomes your problem, too.  It does not!  \n\nHowever, he is showing you that he plans to spend your money how he sees fit and try to control you by financial means.  Do not let this happen.  You appear to be financially intelligent.  Don't change that.  Change the boyfriend.  Debt is a terrible, terrible thing to incur.  Someone else's debt?  Exponentially worse!", "I asked him what\u2019s stopping him from immediately divorcing me he said he\u2019s willing to sign over a portion of his house (he rents out) to me based on how much debt I pay off for him. I asked him why he wants to use my savings like a line of credit. The banks apparently don\u2019t loan against rentals.. He\u2019s expressed that once we\u2019re married we would have joint accounts and if his cc debt is paid off, we would be able to save more.

He paid for the fiancee lawyer all the green card stuff and never once asked her for money. The savings she went over with were to help get her to exit out of the situation should she need to. Fortunately she has been happily married for over ten years. To me him asking for your money to pay off all his debt, whilst using none of his own assets is a big red flag, he sounds like a scammer. Remember to make decisions based on logic and not emotional coercion, with words like, 'trust me, it is for our future, dont you love me, dont you want to be with me, don't you care, it is better if we do it this way.' Getting angry or not speaking to you if you don't agree. These are not logical reasons. If you weren't going to him he'd be paying his own credit card still, so why do you now have to pay it?
