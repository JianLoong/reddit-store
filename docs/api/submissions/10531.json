You are asking the wrong question.  You shouldn't be asking if you should use your funds to pay off his debt.  You should be asking if you should marry a guy with a lot of credit card debt.  The answer is NO.  Even if he manages to pay off the debt himself.  You two are not on the same page, financially speaking.  Might as well put a divorce lawyer on retainer before you get married...", "NTA. His CC debt is his. I've almost left my wife over her CC debt (she got a CC and maxed it out without telling me once or twice while I was the only one providing income..) so I recommend you don't get involved in a situation where somebody else's CC debt is your responsibility.", "NTA, this does sound sketchy, nothing stops him divorcing you. It's not joint debt, it's solo debt.", "NTA ...he should pay off his own credit card debt before you get married OP. You also should find out what other debt he has like student loans, pay day loans, collections etc if you haven't already. You will not have any income for 3 months but it sounds like your bf is still expecting you to pay half the share of the bills. Possibly you still need to discuss finances and spending habits.

I suggest you postpone marriage or moving until after he has made concrete attempts to start paying off his debt and proving to you he won't be a continual drain once you have shared finances.\n\nOffering to help pay off his debt (not do all of it) ONCE you are working again and have a stable income would make more sense, especially if he earns that help by supporting you during the 3 months you can't work.", "NTA. He's been dishonest about his debt and now he wants you to go into debt to fix his financial issues. He's telling you his debts will be yours, but do you want them to be?\n\nBefore you do *anything* else and before you move into his home, talk to a lawyer, preferably one that has experience with US family law. Discuss if it is possible to draft a prenup where debts/assets accrued before the marriage can be held separate to joint marital assets.

Please don\u2019t let him convince you to use your nest egg to pay off his debt. This is a terrible idea. His debt will become your debt? Seriously? Have you discussed joint finances? His plan to pay down as much of his debt as possible before then? You\u2019ll be living off your savings until you get a job but at the same time you\u2019ll pay down his debt?

Because you should run.", "What exactly is he bringing to this relationship? \n\nI\u2019m really curious. There seems to be a lot of support and moving countries from you - but paying off his bills, and taking care of yourself - all seems to be on you??\n\nNTA - but I\u2019d really think this through", "Honestly, a large amount of CC debt is a pretty big red flag for your future. His expectation that you would simply eliminate the debt on his behalf, and trying to pressure you into doing so is an even bigger red flag.\n\nThey aren\u2019t necessarily deal breakers. I don\u2019t know the situation, why he has the debt, how recent the debt is, if he\u2019s still using ccs to pay for many things and still racking up large amounts of debt, how he treats you otherwise, etc. I\u2019d suggest you ask him more questions about that debt and his current practices (unless you already know the answers) before you go forward with the marriage.\n\nCC debt is much different than bringing in a car loan, student loans, mortgage, etc into a marriage. One shows uncontrolled and un budgeted spending habits, which is a sign of poor financial practices and doesn\u2019t speak well for your future finances, while the others are much more standard parts of modern life (but even those should be talked about honestly with a future spouse).\n\nNTA.", "NTA, not even close. \n\nHe lied to you about his debt becoming your debt, too.  You are not responsible for any debt he acquired before your marriage and even then, you can set a pre-nup stating all finances are separate and each is responsible for their own debt during the marriage.  His lie, to me, indicates he's trying to trick/scare you into paying his bills by implying it becomes your problem, too.  It does not!  \n\nHowever, he is showing you that he plans to spend your money how he sees fit and try to control you by financial means.  Do not let this happen.  You appear to be financially intelligent.  Don't change that.  Change the boyfriend.  Debt is a terrible, terrible thing to incur.  Someone else's debt?  Exponentially worse!", "I asked him what\u2019s stopping him from immediately divorcing me he said he\u2019s willing to sign over a portion of his house (he rents out) to me based on how much debt I pay off for him. I asked him why he wants to use my savings like a line of credit. The banks apparently don\u2019t loan against rentals.. He\u2019s expressed that once we\u2019re married we would have joint accounts and if his cc debt is paid off, we would be able to save more.

Fortunately she has been happily married for over ten years. To me him asking for your money to pay off all his debt, whilst using none of his own assets is a big red flag, he sounds like a scammer. Remember to make decisions based on logic and not emotional coercion, with words like, 'trust me, it is for our future, dont you love me, dont you want to be with me, don't you care, it is better if we do it this way.' Getting angry or not speaking to you if you don't agree. These are not logical reasons. If you weren't going to him he'd be paying his own credit card still, so why do you now have to pay it?

Is your quality of living and mental health going to improve moving or will it decline? Only you can decide but please update us with what you decide. Sending you hugs \ud83e\udd17 and I hope that you please put your needs first. \n\nPs I mention mental health cause this is stressful and scary! Good luck", "Wait. He rents out? It\u2019s an investment property he rents out for passive income or one or he\u2019s renting himself?  If it\u2019s passive income, that\u2019s something else he can sell off to pay his own debt. If he\u2019s texting it himself it\u2019s not his and he can\u2019t offer you part of anything.", "He lied to you about his financial situation, and now he's basically straight up telling you that he plans to take all your money. I can't imagine why you're even considering marrying this guy.", "Wow, that's a big red flag! He failed to disclose his debt, and instead of handling it himself, with selling a spare vehicle, he wants you to do it??? Please don't do it.", "\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\u26a0\ufe0f\nDO NOT MARRY HIM!\nHe has held important info from you that is financially a liability. \nYou should NOT trust him.", "So he lied to you when it was important and now wants you to not only swallow that lie but also solve his problem for him ? How long have you been with this man out of interest ? I wouldn\u2019t be marrying someone like that personally", "There is nothing weird: He will pump you dry - on purpose or not, he will not be able to avoid it, it is part of his situation and lifestyle - and then you will BOTH be in debt over your heads. Getting a divorce THEN will not solve it, you will keep the debt as a problem for many years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo: Why are you rushing into marrying him? Let him solve his finances first ... You CAN NOT bring in enough money, he can always spend more.", "You should break up. This is weird. He has two cars but wants you to empty your savings to pay his debt. All of this sounds sketchy. Run.\n\nNTA", "Not sure how it works your side of the pond, and international law makes stuff hard, but you can marry for the green card, and still have an ironclad prenup that allows seperate finances. \n\nAlso, you're moving to HIS PLACE to be with him. He should pay your living expenses until you find a job, or at least for the full time it takes to get your green card, and then at least 2-3 months for you to find a suitable job. Save your savings for a car for yourself to get to that job, or for a downpayment for a house. \n\nHim not being honest about his financial situation is a giant red flag. Beware.", "As soon as you get there they\u2019ll b more financial surprises coming your way. If he can lie about a credit card debt what else is he lying about. I\u2019d say hold off moving and really evaluate the situation. You may just be shooting yourself in your foot", "I am so glad you came here to see if ur the ah\nObvi NTA\nI'm on board with the tough love. Run, girl, run\ud83d\udc97", "What else is he hiding", "NTA OP. If he wants to marry you for you and not for what you bring to him (money to clear debt), then I suggest you bring up the matter of having a prenup. Tell him you didn\u2019t like to be lied to, that you agreed to this marriage with the assumption that he was debt free **(edit: saw your comments, you knew he had a ton of debt (credit card, student loans, irs, & child support payments)but you\u2019re only shocked bc you just found out he hid this one debt from you? Girl, leave him!)** and that it feels that he deliberately left that out to use you. If that is not the case, tell him that to continue with the idea of marriage with him you want a prenup that stipulates separate finances and separate debts. You can even tell him you don\u2019t even want alimony bc \u201cyou\u2019re marrying him for him\u201d. \ud83d\ude06 Then let\u2019s see what he says after that. \n\nSeparate finances is good bc then you\u2019ll never be beholden to a man financially. You should always work to have money for a potential emergency. Never put yourself in a situation where you have no money (he freezes ur access to accounts), a few kids and a husband who has decided he no longer wants to be the doting husband, or to \u201clive with a nag\u201d. \n\nAlso lock your credit. And when you end up needing it you can unlock it.  I have read so many horror stories of women being put in terrible situations (homelessness & bad credit). So it\u2019s best to be prepared.\n\nOne thing to like about Canada is that they have a 6 month long maternity leave with some payment (I think you get 55% of your salary whilst on leave?). Does america have that? I know that some American jobs make women come back a lot earlier, many times way too soon. I see these women deciding to become stay at home moms bc they\u2019re not ready to go back (postpartum depression, other medical reasons) and it\u2019s overall cheaper to watch their own kids (unpaid work) then to put them in daycare.\n\nYou need to consider all this before you decide to marry him op. Good luck \ud83d\udc4d", "That\u2019s not a weird situation, it\u2019s a bad situation, don\u2019t get into it \n\nSorry to be blunt but he shouldn\u2019t have lied about his finances, he won\u2019t take reasonable actions to reduce his debt (sell the truck) and instead expects you to cover it \n\nUnless he changes his attitude he is always going to expect you to cover it", "So he lied. Do not marry him.", "Dude! this is a trap! Don't give this man a single cent!\n\nThis entire situation makes me think of that gif of Whoopi Goldberg in Ghost where she says \"You're in danger, girl\"", "Have you actually read anything you\u2019ve written here?

I specifically made sure I didn\u2019t bring my own debt into my marriage and he should do the same.  He doesn\u2019t need two cars if he can\u2019t pay his own way.  He\u2019s being irresponsible and I am willing to bet there\u2019s more to the story and this is the first in a long line of big asks from him.  Please rethink this decision.", "This. Don't get into a situation where he can do this again and again. Your values and behavior around money are quite different. Do not get married until this is resolved in a way that makes you comfortable. He is unlikely to change.", "Wooow!!! I get the student loan debt, that is really bad for a lot of Americans....but he has two vehicles, one that he's still paying for?, c/c debt, irs debt and has to pay child support? Honey this guy is not waving red flags, he IS a GIANT red flag. He obviously has trouble being FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE.  Do you REALLY want to hitch your wagon to this falling star, headed to implode on impact with your money? Run dear, run away fast.", ">irs debt, credit card debt and car loan debt. It\u2019s really too much for one person to handle and he\u2019s been drowning for a long time. The tax bomb in 10 years is another thing. In my eyes, paying the credit card debt could really help his situation but not being able to support myself would not help my situation. It makes me really sad.\n\ndid he mention the other debts in that questionnaire", "Child support too? Sweetheart what is you doing?", "In five years, this will be you - you will be in as much debt as he is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nwell .. maybe 3 years.", "Don't marry this guy.\n\nFrom a civil standpoint, marriage is the joining of two people for the purposes of owning assets.  When you marry him, even if you don't pay off his credit card debt, you'll end up sharing the burden of his debts.  For instance, when he has no money to pay bills because he's paying so many debts, you're going to end up paying all the housing and food expenses.\n\nIf you marry this guy, he will wreck your finances.\n\nDon't marry him.", "I see deportation from the USA in your future if you go through with this.  Please please reconsider, and stay here in Canada, as he cannot meet his portion of green card requirements, never mind wanting to suck up all your savings.  Best of luck to you.", "I'm not sure if he'd be permitted to sponsor you, since he has money issues galore.  If he also lied to the immigration people to get your application approved, that can also turn into a big problem.  And you will get to know the American Health System up close and personal with only your savings standing between you and disaster... the same money he wants to spend entirely on himself.   While you're under uncertain legal and financial status in a foreign country? Please rethink this.", "To be blunt: You seem awfully naive and not very knowledgeable when it comes to finances.\n\nYour first step should be to educate yourself, find reliable sources for information, maybe pay some money and talk to a financial advisor but make sure that it\u2019s not somebody who profits from selling you products but somebody who charges hourly.\n\nBefore that: Don\u2019t give him money, don\u2019t sign anything, don\u2019t move to the US and definitely don\u2019t marry!\n\nTake your time and reevaluate this relationship when you\u2019re more financially educatedy", "If you stay with him, I think 'he doesn't have the funds' is something you'll be saying a lot.", "No problem OP. You seem like a very sweet and kind person, though a little trusting, and perhaps he is taking advantage of you. \n\nHe has money issues and saw in you a way to pay for his debt. And don\u2019t be surprised if he plans to continue helping himself with your money. \n\nI just read in one of your comments that he lied about his CC situation and on top of that, he refuses to sell his truck to pay off his debt, expecting you to pay it with your savings. This is very scary. You are dealing with someone incredibly financially irresponsible.\n\nI would have a talk with a US immigration and accounting firm so you know what your rights and options are, and if you really want to be with him, then have a straight conversation letting him know the things you want, won\u2019t do, including separate finances. I would also consider a prenup. \n\nBtw, for the green card process, the USCIS (American immigration), will want to see that you have joint ownership of important things: a mortgage, a lease, utility bills, a car lease, and bank accounts. I would advise you to open a new bank account together but one that is separate from the account where you have your money and savings. This is something you can cancel anytime and won\u2019t cause any issues for your credit. Also DO NOT open credit cards or loans together because you will be liable, and with his spending patterns, you certainly will and he will ruin your credit.", "NTA he\u2019s not husband material", "Somehow it'll be worth less. Once the paper is signed he'll start asking for more money", "Seriously. Step back. Listen to yourself. He is already showing he is unwilling to sacrifice but expects you to. He's already lied.

Plus, we don't have any hospital or doctor bills. I don't know how you can manage it in the States.", "Thank you!", "He mentioned all but the cc debt.\n\nEdit: misread.. almost 2am sorry.", "Hehe. Exactly!\n\nBut I\u2019ll sign that I owe you!\n\nAnd I can pay with, ahhhh, ummmmm, some beans????", "Anytime! He's ALREADY trying to manipulate you into paying off HIS debts, that right there is financial ABUSE. You don't know what else he will try once you are livibg with him. Abusers typically escalate AFTER marriage because they have the victim \"trapped\" now, with very little resources and no easy way to get out. \n\nPlus, things here in the US are not great right now: it's a political maelstrom in Washington D.C.-they can't get along at all; we have no healthcare if you are working age with no job, inflation is pricing us out of the basics like food and toithpaste, and homelessness keeps going up because 78% of us are two paychecks away from being homeless, so shit is just bad for everybody here right now. If I had the money and a place to go, I'd relocate out of the US yesterday if I could. And ALL of my family is here, but I'd leave for a place that treats it's residents better in a heartbeat. \n\nRead this ebook, see if you can find other recognizable situations in it.
