One of them brought her boyfriend They begged me to stay for dinner so we went to a fancy restaurant. \n\nWe ordered our food and while ordering, the two guys ordered some apps and drinks for themselves, letting us know we can eat some if we like.

The ordered alot too so it added up.\n\nI had to leave early (my other friends were still eating) so once I was done I asked for my seperate bill. The waitress asked if the apps are included. Before I could answer my friends boyfriend (who is  her boyfriend of 2 months and this was our second time meeting him) said yes for me. I was annoyed and before I could say anything the waitress took off. He knew I was annoyed cause he looked at me and said thank you, you are a real star. I was like wth. I looked at my two friends and they didnt say anything.\n\nI excused myself to take a phone call. After speaking with my sister, I just went to the waitress (seperately and away from my friends) and told her theres a mistake. I didnt eat the apps and to just give me my seperate bill.\n\nI returned to my table and the lady gave my bill face down. This girls boyfriend asks \"does her bill include apps?\" Bless the waitress, she just said its her bill. I paid and tipped the waitress extra and left. But I been feeling uncomfortable about this whole thing.\n\n\nEdit: Thanks to everyone who took the time to message. I wish I had enough coins for your posts. I didnt want to lose my friends over a few dollars but I think from reading the comments its clear if they dont respect my boundaries I will just avoid that kind of setting or stop hanging out with those type of people.

I make a lot of money so they just expected her to pay for everything because her husband does well. She wanted to split the check so they called her selfish and broke off the relationship.

That's absurd. And the people who stayed quiet need to be put in their place too. This is a ridiculous situation.", "NTA. You paid your share.", "NTA. You made it clear that you weren't going to eat any apps. Hopefully now it's clear you won't be taken advantage of either.", "NTA. You handled it the best you could. You did not let them walk all over you. All it takes is one experience like this to keep you from going out with people you don\u2019t already know and trust. I call people like this mini-predators. They\u2019ll take advantage of anyone they can, pretending to be friends.", "NTA. Next time tell the waitress before you order that you want a separate check.

Others in the group do the same couples together usually. They were trying to intimidate you into paying part of their bill. They probably thought you would be too embarrassed to make a fuss/scene.
