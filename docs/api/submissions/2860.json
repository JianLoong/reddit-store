What would happen if you decided to move out?", "NTA and honestly move out as soon as you can. Also a twin and that shit is NOT healthy and will absolutely make you resentful later and ruin your relationship, with both her and your parents.

Her mention of anxiety when she isn't with you is little bit of a step too far. NTA", "The older I get the more my family tries to keep me from being an adult. Since I've turned 18 I've had to install life 360, and my parents despise me driving my car (that I entirely pay for) anywhere but work. was also told \"Real Adults don't stay up until 2 or 3 in the morning\" when I asked to be treated more like one \ud83d\ude11", "OP already suggested she'd drop sis off before going back out for the night.

The beauty of being an adult is being able to make those decisions for yourself. Obviously if it starts to affect your work or other responsibilities, you have to take that into account but at 18 and early 20s I regularly was awake until the sun came up.", "Adults your age absolutely do stay up late hanging out. Maybe not all the time, but definitely regularly. If you work til late at night you still need some down time before going to bed. It's no different to someone who finishes work at 5pm having several hours to have dinner, do chores, watch some TV or whatever before bed, you're just on a different schedule because you finish work so late. Do you need a healthy balance? Yes. Balance is important for both your physical and mental health, but this is the time in your life you can get away with pushing the limits a bit. As long as you're meeting your commitments and not getting sick, your time is your own to do with as you please.\n\nIt sounds like you and your twin are in different places on the extrovert-introvert spectrum and she needs quiet time to recharge while you need social interaction. Neither is right or wrong but you're not responsible for her feelings. If she needs to be alone after work you can drop her home. Her anxiety that you're not there is something she needs to work through. Unfortunately your parents aren't fostering her independence by the sound of it but she does need to learn to live her life without you there constantly. Ideally she could get some professional help with her anxiety but there are plenty of free resources that can help (e.g. headspace)\n\nETA: NTA", "I am 23 and am writing this at 5:03 am as I get ready for bed.

Some people are just more awake at night. I am late 20s.", "I'm not entirely sure. We've always been very close, so maybe the idea of being separated from me?? but she's having plans to move out of the STATE within the next year or so, not sure how she plans to do that if she can't stand me staying up :/ She just doesn't see me as someone who knows how to make my own decisions.", "Parents that force twins to stay together are the worse. Your sister needs to develop her own independence outside of you. I'm a twin myself and moved outside the state for college this semester and have had no issues with the separation. Its difficult because the world likes to see twins as a set that shouldn't be seperated, but they don't understand just how damaging that mindset is.", "I don't mean this to be rude or insulting or anything, but she sounds like a five year old who can't sleep without the hall light on.\n\nShe needs to find a way to be more independent and to show you more respect as your own person. She's treating you like you're an extension of her, or like you're an emotional support animal. Neither are true.\n\nI have anxiety, and I understand that it's difficult, but she's taking it too far and not considering YOUR feelings. Having anxiety is not an excuse to be selfish or inconsiderate.", "I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s more a manipulative tool she\u2019s using. Having  someone all to themselves then seeing them spreading their wings and being socially active and popular might be making her feel left out and as though she\u2019s losing OP. \n\nI imagine her anxiety is being sparked but it\u2019s also a way of getting her sister\u2019s attention back onto her and controlling the situation."]}
