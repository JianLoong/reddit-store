I've been a long-term customer of my wireless carrier so this year I was offered a very good deal on his line and a bonus of a new Samsung watch to go with his phone.  This young man grew up with nothing and my biological sons (17 & 22) are very well provided for so I thought it would make him feel more at home to have the same nice things. I even ordered his an embroidered stocking with his name on it to match all of ours so he would feel fully included. \n\nWe don't have a lot of money but my partner and I both felt that this young man needed a little more this year. My partner (M49) went with me to the wireless store and, when I was done, he joked about me not getting him a watch.

We joke around a lot. ) The watch and the wireless plan cost me next to nothing but the gesture was priceless to my adoptive son and made him cry happy tears. \n\nThe day after Christmas my partner went back to work and told his co-worker (F24) that he was bummed because he didn't get a watch too.  Apparently, she jumped right up and left work. She returned about 15 minutes later with a brand-new Samsung watch for him.

Perhaps point out to your partner that he's financially benefitting from what is likely a painful childhood.", "Unless she's like oprah-rich and gives gifts to everyone, (you get a watch, and you get a watch, and you get a watch) yeah, it's *definitely* not appropriate.\n\nMaybe find out if there's really a co-worker giving him gifts. Because who in their right mind would think it was okay to accept this from a co-worke?  Besides probably someone using it as a bs excuse, but really getting the stuff in an even worse way?", "NTA, what kind of co-worker spend 500 on a whim because their co-worker wanted a smart watch? Some weird red flags there she's either an ott people pleaser or she has a thing for your husband", "NTA. Your husband is an AH.  You thought it was a joke, but he wasn't joking. He complained about the family to a co-worker. For the co-worker to react like that, it means he complains about the family to them a lot.", "NTA!!!!\n\nSo many red flags here!  First your husband is complaining about your marriage to a younger female co worker. \n\nThen!!! She felt comfortable enough (intimacy much??) to buy him a hugely expensive gift. \n\nThis is sounding like an affair. I hate to say this, but I would quietly check his phone records and email history. If he\u2019s secretive about his phone and won\u2019t let you have the passcode, that would be another HUGE red flag. \n\nThe trust is broken here and the relationship is inappropriate. \n\nI would recommend the book \u201cnot just friends\u201d by Shirley glass. It helped me and so many others in your situation out. \n\nThere\u2019s another site called surviving infidelity which is an excellent place to read and ask questions. There are many veteran posters who can help guide you through this discovery process.", "I've never seen that movie.  I love Alan. Now I'll have to watch it.", "I mentioned to my boss that I built my first gaming computer and was saving up for a pair of nice monitors. At her prior job she was wfh during Covid and when she left they didn\u2019t have her return the monitors. She brought them for me later in the week. Was this an inappropriate gift? Does it make a difference that we are both female? Serious questions.", "Lmao I didnt even think of that but now you've said it... mighty convenient that a much younger woman just happened to have the money to spare AND found one pretty fast to give the same day she found he wanted one. Interesting.", "Since I never take anything at face value and I had this same thought before posting here, I did look into it.  His co-workers confirmed his story... even the one that doesn't like him. She did indeed buy him multiple gifts exceeding $50 for the company gift exchange and the story he told about the watch was witnessed by 4 other co-workers.  Plus,  he didn't have the money to buy it himself at the time and it was not purchased on his wireless account. \n\nI've known him a long time and he knows I don't play the jealous game. We've never played those games with each other.  If this was just a relationship issue,  I wouldn't have posted it here because I know it's inappropriate for him to do while in a relationship. There is no question about that. Lol\n\nMy professional background is HR and business management so my primary concern was that the gifts were expensive (normally not allowed by companies) and given during the company gift exchange is wildly professionally inappropriate.", "Hooo boy yeah that's not good. I would never dream of giving my coworkers such expensive gifts, especially singling one out.", "Nope just a random co-worker.", "If it makes a difference this was a pretty big company and they had nice monitors. I priced them and together they would be a little over $800.", "I think the monitors being used, gotten for free, and something your boss didn\u2019t need anymore make the gift okay. But I could see it still potentially causing issues if your coworkers know about it and any of them decide it\u2019s unfair they didn\u2019t get anything. \n\nIf your boss bought two brand new monitors for you, then that would have been clearly inappropriate.", "No,  that's not an inappropriate gift as they were not purchased for you and they weren't given to you at the company holiday gift exchange. They were something extra she had laying around that you could put to good use. I've gifted many household extras to many different people including computer stuff instead of dropping them off at Goodwill because I had no use for them. It's about how she ran out and paid cash for expensive gifts for only one co-worker and only bought gifts at all for her co-workers that are male. The fact that your both female is irrelevant to my point.", "She comes from farm money and is spoiled by her family.", "I know a woman whose husband had an affair with a lesbian woman who was MARRIED TO HER PARTNER. \n\nBoth the cheaters were fucked up people. Gay or not (cheating has nothing to do with being gay imho), fucked up people find each other and then fuck. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you went through this.", "Sounds like he took advantage, knowing she would run out and buy it after complaining. Because he knows how generous she is. \n\nStill, it's wrong of him to accept such an expensive gift.", "It doesn\u2019t matter if you are both women or that the company is large. It is not inappropriate for you to make small talk with your boss about building a gaming computer, nor is it inappropriate for her to offer the monitors to you when you could use them and she seemingly couldn\u2019t.\n\nWhat makes OP\u2019s situation inappropriate is her husband seemingly venting about his wife to a female coworker AND a clear *pattern* around her singling him out with extravagant gifts.\n\nNTA, OP.", "That is different, in your case your boss already had them in her possession (and she didn't even have to pay for them). And since she wasn't using them anyway, she gave them to you because they'd just be gathering dust otherwise.\n\nIn OP's case, she went out to buy a brand new watch right after he mentioned wanting one. If she still had an old one lying around that she wasn't using and just gave that one to him it'd be fine, but she didn't. She spent that $500 specifically on him, and there lies the problem.", "NTA. I see a few red flags.  Your partner telling someone else that he was bummed he did not get a watch and not you.   The co-worker for immediately getting up, leaving and getting him said watch. Your partner for accepting said watch.", "That is extremely inappropriate. It's not like he said \"oh, I'm really thirsty, I wish I had a soda\" and she bought him a soda while on her break. She ran out in the middle of the workday to buy a fairly expensive gift for her married coworker. And this isn't the first time she did it. This is not okay, he needs to tell her to stop. It's not a healthy fixation and could potentially lead to stalking.", "NTA. This lady isn\u2019t Santa Clause. Who made it her responsibility to make sure everyone (especially your husband) is happy every minute that she should run out and get him the present that you didn\u2019t? Next time he\u2019ll mention \u201cPoor me, my wife had a headache again last night.\u201d Unacceptable! She\u2019ll take him by the hand for a quickie in the bathroom to take care of that too.", "NTA\n\nMany years ago my husband helped a  coworker (single mother of 2 boys) with some house repairs her father was unable to do (her dad paid him for the work). She began buying him gifts, not just a thank you gift but numerous gifts from her & each of her sons on his birthday & at Christmas. When I told him it was inappropriate, that she wanted him, he let her know he wouldn't accept any gifts from her or her kids again. She went NC immediately after that. My instincts were right.", "NTA. I don't accept huge gifts from people and don't give them either. I firmly believe that you don't accept what you can't afford. The one exception is my parents because I am always grateful but not beholden them to them. Gifts from other people make me feel beholden and I feel more comfortable being a giver than a taker. That's with friends.  With coworkers? Absolutely no expensive gifts either way. That feels unprofessional.", "NTA. \n\nWhat? WHAT?????????!??", "Yup. Absolutely NO legitimate or valid reason for her giving your hubby these gifts. You are 100% right to be concerned and find this highly inappropriate. NTA", "*I thought I'd made it clear - when it comes to me, you can have anything you want.*\n\ud83d\ude2c", "Or 3. They\u2019re already sleeping with one another and OP\u2019s partner is playing the naive card to explain gifts from his mistress to coworkers and wife?", "No, he my eldest son's best friend. Has been since they were 12 or 13. It's a long story but I did offer to adopt him years ago.  To me he is my son and to my biological sons he is their brother.", "Prior to this, I was very sure. He and their other co-workers couldn't stand her. Now I'm not.", "No,  it's because we don't make that much money. I know what we both make and what the monthly bills are. There's no way he could have afforded to buy them or spend money on other things.  Not right now.", "I thought about that and looked into it.  I was able to confirm his story was true.", "Yes. I've met her multiple times.", "No.  I checked in on that.", "He is my adoptive son.  He's been my eldest son's best friend since they were 12 or 13. His family is not a \"family\" by any stretch of the imagination and we've taken him in as our family since we met him. To me, he is my middle child and to my biological sons, he is their brother. He calls me 'Mom' to his biological mother. This is how we introduce him to others. I even offered at one time to legally adopt him but now that he's 22 its a moot point. \n\nAlso, that's just how I speak when speaking to others about someone. No one has ever pointed that out before. Lol", "I understand his excitement. I really do.  It's a cool piece of tech.  Honestly,  I was going to get him the Samsung Watch 5 Pro for his birthday in March.  I couldn't afford to get it right now and was going to save for it because I know he would like it.  I'm  disabled and on a limited income so I have to save for anything beyond monthly basics. I couldn't afford to pay full price cash for a watch for him at the time I got the other one.  I basically got the watch for my adoptive son for free on my account as a rare long-term customer reward from my carrier.  My partner has his own account so I wouldn't have gotten that deal and would have had to pay full price for his watch up front and I couldn't afford that.", "I verified it before posting this.  Its real.", "After reading Reddit responses, I'm beginning to have a similar feeling about her intentions.  A subject I'll be bringing up with my partner as well. I've always felt that trust in my relationship is an absolute must and still do so I guess  I need to find out if she is an issue besides her being unprofessional at work. I didn't question his loyalty before because cheating is something him and I both feel very strongly about but now I'm not sure.", "You misunderstand.  I'm not jealous.  My point to him was that it's unprofessional and inappropriate for her to only be giving gifts to her male co-workers and to only be giving expensive gifts to only one co-worker at the company gift exchange. And it was inappropriate for him to accept those gifts knowing that. Honestly,  my first thought and argument to him that he doesn't seem to understand is the possible legal ramifications. \n\nHim and one of his male co-workers exchanged personal gifts during their off time.  They were also expensive gifts but it was not unprofessional nor inappropriate as they were done on personal time because they are friends. \n\nMy partner also received very nice gifts from a couple female friends and that was not inappropriate either as they are gifts from friends.", "If her parents are the type to give her large amounts of money it\u2019s possible she didn\u2019t realize how wildly inappropriate it was. I know people that as adults still get $2k/ week allowance from daddy. But it is absolutely inappropriate regardless.", "How long has this coworker been there? I'm getting a sinking feeling that she's setting your husband up for a sexual harassment payout. That's why she gave to all the men, who probably stopped accepting because this is so inappropriate, but your husband is the one continuing to accept. \n\nOr I have been on Reddit too long and she has the most peculiar boundary issues.", "Random co-worker or friend with benefits? It\u2019s wild to me no one hinted that perhaps they\u2019re ALREADY sleeping with one another?", "Did she give this to him publicly? Because that could seriously damage his reputation at work. He needs to stay away from this girl. Aside from personal lines this could damage his career.", "Do! We rewatched it on Christmas Day. It's fun.", "So in an instance like this, what would happen if another co-worker brought this to HR?", "Thanks.\n\nIf he is telling the truth then something strange is happening. \n\nGood luck finding out.", "Well, I\u2019m really sorry she stole your thunder.", "Wow. And I've read the edit, so... yeah. So many expensive gifts, and just for him. I would not be happy. You're certainly NTA", "He's probably totally unaware of her \"intentions\", my hubby was, so I wouldn't worry about his loyalty to you. But i definitely would talk to him about how her gift made you feel. Just remember, do not get accusatory, that won't help you", "She's been there roughly a year. While she has a record of being \"inappropriate\" with other males she works with,  my concern is the unprofessional part of this situation because the gifts were given at a company event and are waaaaay beyond the $50 set threshold for gifts.", "That's been said many times here.", "Yes,  at the company gift exchange.", "As long as there was proof and there were no other instances (there are in this case), it would be a final written warning, the \"gifts\" would have to be returned and the two employees would only be scheduled on different shifts.\n\nIn this case she gave only him multiple expensive gifts over $50. Personally as HR, as long as it was in the company handbook,  I would terminate both of them as it potentially makes the company liable to various lawsuits.  Which is the concern I was trying to express to him that he doesn't seem to understand.", "Regardless of the reason behind it, it's inappropriate.\n\nYour place of work is not the place to work out your issues, and your coworkers are not stand-ins or surrogates for people who did not fulfill a role or need in your past. If she \"doesn't know any better\" then she needs to learn how to conduct herself professionally in a professional space, like, yesterday. She's a grown-ass adult. \n\nThe *perception* in the workplace is going to be that they're hooking up, and that can put both their careers and reputations at risk.", "So it would only take one 'enemy' or jealous co-worker to start a whole $hit show.  Or the girl in question deciding she isn't getting the response she wants.  How in the world does your husband not see that?  Is he usually na\u00efve or socially inept?   Is he having a midlife crisis or something similar?  Have there been other times he's seemed greedy or won over by expensive gifts?", "Wouldn't you agree that assuming something about a relationship between two people you don't know nothing about is kinda wrong? She's being for sure unusual, but you cannot assume things you don't know about.", ">Maybe she was abused by her father or there are not friendly female coworkers or who the fuck knows. \n\nI was responding to what you said there. \n\nWhile I don't know *why* co-worker is doing these things, I know that her actions are outside the conventions of and  inappropriate for a professional workplace regardless of her motivations.", "NTA. Marinara flags galore! Tell him to give it back to her and you both can save up for one for Father\u2019s Day or his bday.", "INFO:\n\n> I know this because he couldn't afford to buy them\n\nWhy is he unable to afford a smart watch on your budget but you're able to for your adoptive son?\n\nSounds like this coworker is spending more money on him than you are and it's making you self conscious.  The watch seems to make him very happy and clearly it's something he wanted.\n\nI get what you're implying that it sounds like they're having an affair or there's something going on between them.  I agree it's a little odd to spend that much money on someone, but maybe she just has a lot of money to spend on people and considers him a good friend.", "I'm honestly leaning toward this.  I feel like everyone is jumping to conclusions on them having an affair, but this girl is young and OP mentioned she comes from money.  It's entirely possible she doesn't really know the value of a dollar outside her family and thinks this is making someone (she imagines to be) less fortunate than her happy in a sort of weird way.", "I thought of that, but then I figured he\u2019d for sure have said he bought it for himself."]}
