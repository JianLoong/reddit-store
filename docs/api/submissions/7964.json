Isla sent out invitations to basically the whole class (including me) a week before her birthday party. I let my mom (48f) know about this and she was excited, she helped me pick out my outfit and she picked a beautiful dress for me. The dress was a ruffled navy blue dress with no sleeves. My mom said that it belonged to her when she was in her late 20s, so I didn't worry about having the same outfit with someone else.\n\nIt was the day of the party and my mom drove me to Isla's house. She waved goodbye to me and then I went inside. There were lots of people already surprisingly, then I noticed Isla. Her dress was surprising similar to mine, so I pointed it out in jokingly and said stuff like 'what a coincidence! We're twinning!'. But Isla got mad at me. She said that I should change my dress because it was her birthday and that I'm stealing the spotlight, but I couldn't call my mom now. My mom had a night shift and my dad was also employed, also, I'm an only child. I said to Isla that I couldn't but she said she didn't care and told me to get out.\n\nI left the party feeling guilty, walking back home in the cold weather. After the party, everyone texted me saying I was an AH for being an attention seeker. I told my mom about this and she was furious. I didn't mean to upset Isla at her birthday party, but I also didn't think she'd be mad about a dress.

If Isla was uncomfortable with what you were wearing, she could have offered you an alternative from her closet or some kind of accessory to dress down your dress... like a hoodie or sweater. She could have also changed since it was her house. You didn't have any other options available to you, so not sure what she expected you to do.", "Isla is the asshole! Her parents are huge assholes for enabling their daughter\u2019s bad behavior. She sounds unhinged and dripping with jealousy. \nHer request was ridiculous and rude. \n\nI\u2019m gobsmacked that her parents would allow her to throw you out and force you to walk home. \n\nThese are uncaring shallow people.", "NTA\n\nwow get better friends", "NTA! Have your mom contact her mom and have this brat face consequences.", "NTA, love, it wasn't intentional and you did absolutely nothing wrong! Isla sounds like she has got issues on her own, and they are not your problem, just stay clear of her, nothing good there. I am so sorry you had to walk all the way home though", "NTA. You didn't go there trying to steal attention from her, and she got upset about a really stupid and silly thing. I don't know why anyone would think you would done anything wrong. She behaved very badly.", "You wore it better.  NTA", "Oh love these girls are not your mates. Friends do not do things like this. Ditch the mean girls and find your real friends \u2665\ufe0f\n\nNTA, we\u2019ve all been there accidentally matching what makes it better is the ability to laugh it off carry on. You\u2019re obviously far more mature than the \u201cfriend\u201d.", "It was a coincidence, not intentional, and the dress wasn\u2019t even the same. Where were her parents in all of this? Why would they let a 14-year-old left in their care go home by herself in the middle of winter? NTA", "NTA. Girl you\u2019re young, go make some better friends hun. You don\u2019t need to deal with all of this toxicity right now. Isla is a drama queen and so are all her friends.", "Troll", "NTA. Like you said it was a coincidence. I would say \"chop this all up to kids wanting attention for their bday\" but adults act the same if not worse. For future engagements you attend, you can still look nice for the event, but try to keep it simple as well. Unfortunately people are petty and it will be less stressful for you. Also they aren't your friends for how they treated you", "Yes for sure NTA How heartless could she be for kicking OP out and making them walk in the cold weather like that.", "Yes, also if Isla was a good friend, she could have offered you an alternative dress to wear, not kicked you out in the cold", "Please have your mom contact her mom. You walked home alone in the dark without even an easily-available adult if something went wrong. Unless Isla gets this behavior from her mom, there is likely to be a discussion of her behavior.", "I'm assuming parents don't know, because if something happened to her on the walk, they'd be in trouble. They're the adults who have taken responsiblity for the child that evening. Parents ought to know.", "While she was screaming, I told her that I didn't mean it cause the dress belonged to my mom but she didn't listen and just kept telling me to change or leave", "That\u2019s really messed up. I would talk to your parents and have them talk to the supervising parents. That\u2019s wildly inappropriate to send you home alone in the cold. If I was your parent I would be making war over this", "How would you have changed when you didn't have access to your wardrobe? That's pretty silly."]}
