And you have been nothing but perfectly nice and accommodated her by making a special meal that is not exotic, intimidating or too spicy but that still wasn't good enough. She has to choose, complaining when the food is too \"exotic and intimidating\" or complaining because she has boring plain chicken, rice and peas. She can't have both.", "NTA.

You literally cannot win because she just wants to trash you. \n\nI\u2019d definitely never cook for her again, though.
