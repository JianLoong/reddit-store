When I was eight, I got my mother to sign custody of me over to my father. The why/how is relevant, but I'm trying to keep this short. \n\nAnyway, I lived with my Dad until I was 27 (when I got married). He gave me free room and board all those years too. \n\nFast forward about ten years. I'm now 37, my wife and I were looking at buying a house. We found a large property big enough for a main house and two in-law house types. We didn't have enough money to build the in-law houses, so we approached both my parents. We told them that if they gave us some money, we would build each an in-law house. So, for example, from left to right, Mom's House, My house, and Dad's house. \n\nWhen we approached my Mom about it, she blew us off as money hungry trying to get her money. \n\nMy Dad, on the other hand, jumped at the idea. So he sold his house and gave us everything he got for it when he sold it. Since my Mom wouldn't be living near us, we changed the plans slightly and built one big house with a separate entrance for my Dad. So he got his own kitchen, living room, bedroom, etc.  It's a whole house in our basement, but a separate driveway, garage for his car, etc. \n\nWhen we built it, we also made it for our kids, but our son passed away. So we have three decent-sized bedrooms that don't get used. We originally planned for three kids, but sadly, that didn't work out how we wanted it to happen. \n\nAfter we built the house, my Mom retired, and we threw her a retirement party at our home. During the party, we sat outside talking, and the conversation about money came up for retirement. My mom told her sister how she wanted to spend her money in retirement. One thing she wanted to do was to sell her house and use the money to travel, etc. Her sister said she wanted to save money to leave her kids as a legacy. My Mom said snarkily, \"A legacy? Why would I leave a legacy to my kids?\" During this conversation, I told my Mom it was not about leaving me money, but she needed to save some so that if she got into her 80s and needed help, money was left to care for her. When I said that, she said, \"I can take care of myself.\" \n\nMy Mom is now 83. Her husband has dementia, and she cannot care for him anymore. She has no money, and with recent rent increases, she can't afford to make rent anymore (she used to own a home but sold it to travel). She called me asking if they could move in with me and my wife to help care for her husband and her. I still remember the legacy comment from 13 years ago during her retirement party. While on the phone, I flat out told her, \"Told you so,\" and said, \"You said you can take care of yourself, do it,\" and hung up on her. \n\nMy brother called and told me I was an asshole for not letting her move in with me. So I told him that maybe she should move in with him, but that didn't go over too well either (that's another long story too). \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1691896968, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15po02p/aita_for_not_allowing_my_destitute_mother_to_live/", "score": 192, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Unless you think morals are somehow time-dependent", "The idea of filial piety should go away, it\u2019s a stupid reversal of parental responsibility. Yes, morals are often time dependent. Slavery, pedophellia, and genocide have all been considered moral at different times. Todays morals are almost completely different from what they were 2500 years ago, and there have been many layers of thought added since then. Confucius himself probably wouldn\u2019t recognise, or agree with, the way his writings are interpreted today.", "This is an inherently Christian, Western mindset and isn't universal in any sense. Not saying that's bad, but that's what it is. So who are you to say that another approach is wrong?

Is homosexuality immoral?", "Would it have been morally acceptable for me to own slaves when it was considered ok?", "Generally speaking other ways aren\u2019t wrong. When enforced by law or social pressure, filial piety is one of the exceptions, because it is basically a form of indentured servitude, or \u201cslavery with extra steps\u201d. But even then it\u2019s acceptable if the person helping their parents CHOOSES to do so of their own will. That is NOT the case here however.", "Yes, if you were a wealthy citizen in the Roman Empire, for example, it would have been morally acceptable to own slaves because you lived in a society that considered it normal and morally acceptable. Just as it would not be morally acceptable to own slaves now. Morality is fluid and ever-changing.\n\nFor a less controversial example, is it morally acceptable to hit your child if they misbehave? There are still a lot of people who believe it is because the tide has only recently shifted against corporal punishment.", "Oh please, if society didn't pressure people to do stuff they should, we'd never get off the couch. This obsession with people choosing every single thing as their own special individuals uninfluenced by anything is infantile. But back to the slavery comment, the law requires that you take care of your kids. That's also slavery by your logic", "I think we may be inadvertently talking about two different things and it's my bad. What society considers morally acceptable is fluid as you said, but what a particular moral philosophical framework considers moral is much less open to change.", "There is a certain amount of truth to that, either extreme is bad. I\u2019m personally more in favour of a permissive society than a restrictive one. But, no, having to care for your children isn\u2019t slavery, because having children is a choice. When you chose to have children, you also chose to accept the responsibility of raising them.", "Yes, moral frameworks are going to be less open to change because they are pushed and reinforced by people who believe in them and want to strengthen them. But just because the Confucian moral framework is rigid doesn't mean we should care about some long-dead guys' opinions. He thought filial piety was important, so what?\n\nPlato thought democracy was bad and we needed to be ruled by enlightened kings. But no one cares about his opinions outside of academic studies of ancient philosophy."]}
