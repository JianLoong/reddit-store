When I was eight, I got my mother to sign custody of me over to my father. The why/how is relevant, but I'm trying to keep this short. \n\nAnyway, I lived with my Dad until I was 27 (when I got married). He gave me free room and board all those years too. \n\nFast forward about ten years. I'm now 37, my wife and I were looking at buying a house. We found a large property big enough for a main house and two in-law house types. We didn't have enough money to build the in-law houses, so we approached both my parents. We told them that if they gave us some money, we would build each an in-law house. So, for example, from left to right, Mom's House, My house, and Dad's house. \n\nWhen we approached my Mom about it, she blew us off as money hungry trying to get her money. \n\nMy Dad, on the other hand, jumped at the idea. So he sold his house and gave us everything he got for it when he sold it. Since my Mom wouldn't be living near us, we changed the plans slightly and built one big house with a separate entrance for my Dad. So he got his own kitchen, living room, bedroom, etc.  It's a whole house in our basement, but a separate driveway, garage for his car, etc. \n\nWhen we built it, we also made it for our kids, but our son passed away. So we have three decent-sized bedrooms that don't get used. We originally planned for three kids, but sadly, that didn't work out how we wanted it to happen. \n\nAfter we built the house, my Mom retired, and we threw her a retirement party at our home. During the party, we sat outside talking, and the conversation about money came up for retirement. My mom told her sister how she wanted to spend her money in retirement. One thing she wanted to do was to sell her house and use the money to travel, etc. Her sister said she wanted to save money to leave her kids as a legacy. My Mom said snarkily, \"A legacy? Why would I leave a legacy to my kids?\" During this conversation, I told my Mom it was not about leaving me money, but she needed to save some so that if she got into her 80s and needed help, money was left to care for her. When I said that, she said, \"I can take care of myself.\" \n\nMy Mom is now 83. Her husband has dementia, and she cannot care for him anymore. She has no money, and with recent rent increases, she can't afford to make rent anymore (she used to own a home but sold it to travel). She called me asking if they could move in with me and my wife to help care for her husband and her. I still remember the legacy comment from 13 years ago during her retirement party. While on the phone, I flat out told her, \"Told you so,\" and said, \"You said you can take care of yourself, do it,\" and hung up on her. \n\nMy brother called and told me I was an asshole for not letting her move in with me. So I told him that maybe she should move in with him, but that didn't go over too well either (that's another long story too). \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1691896968, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15po02p/aita_for_not_allowing_my_destitute_mother_to_live/", "score": 671, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who cares about the money. You take care of the parents who did the right thing by you when YOU were vulnerable. So basically treat your mum with the same amount of care that she treated you.", "NAH\n\nI've been reading these comments. It's apparent that this isn't a \"what would Jesus do\" subreddit. Here's my take:\n\nShe's your biological mother, who left you, didn't listen to your advice and lived hedonistically. She's now facing the bill of her choices.\n\nIt's not apparent from your post whether she was there at any point in your life or offered assistance and comfort or not. So we don't know. We know you were ready to take her onto your property 13 years ago.\n\nYou're in a position where you could be able offer assistance, maybe for little inconvenience and little monetary loss. You may be able to have each others company for the last years of your birth mother's life.\n\nYou should talk this through with your wife and see how she sees the situation and your options. If she's reluctant of them moving in, then that's that. If she's anything other, then you need to decide if you want to be judgemental and cut off the relationship now, or whether you want to help her, even when it's not required of you. Make the decision you'll be happy with 10 years from now.", "INFO\n\nNo judgment, sorry. Too many of your long stories that got left out. Maybe your mom has her reasons and you are the asshole? Who knows, it's relevant but you kept it short (except you did not)\n\nETA: In general, when people tell you \"I fucked up and now I need help\", sure you are wntitled to tell them \"Too bad, now die\" but immediately jumping to it is pretty heartless", "Unpopular opinion. ESH!!\n\nFirstly, a death of a child is unimaginable pain, I am sorry for your loss. \n\nNow to my judgement. The \" I told you \" so was Deserved.\n But you legit have explained it is \"destitute mother\" you would prefer to see your mother on the street then let her stay in a room, you don't need anymore. \n\nYeah not every parent is perfect, sounds like you had a good and a bad one. That's pretty normal tbh. \nLucky you had your dad. But now remember you asked her to sign the papers over to your dad.... She did this? She allowed the better parent to raise you giving you the best opportunity. \n\nYeah she is old and wanted to enjoy her money, which you say doesn't matter to you,  so let her enjoy life, we all make jokes about kids taking all our money I'm only 33 but I admit my 2 kids take all mine \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 \n\nThe point now is, she is stuck in a hard spot.... 83 and looking after a dementia patient. \n\nHave a heart. And be the bigger person or I stand by you are both assholes.", "Pride.  Maybe she didn\u2019t  want to be a burden. Maybe she thought things would turn out differently with her husband. Maybe you\u2019re mad because she didn\u2019t take you up on your very very generous offer back then. maybe she\u2019s not a good  planner. Maybe she\u2019s human  here\u2019s the thing: as long as there is still respect between the two of you, and she\u2019s not toxic or abusive or anything like that, consider letting her stay with you because it\u2019s the right thing to do since she is your mother. You don\u2019t have that many years left together  I promise you. If, on the other hand, if she is abusive or toxic, then she\u2019s made her own bed, blah blah blah, but if not, consider kindness", "NTA she chose those as an option. She can\u2019t have it both ways.", "NTA you gave her and opportunity to have a place on your property she declined. You tried explaining she would need to save for retirement and she didn\u2019t listen. Your brother can either let her live with him or mind his own business.", "NTA.

Unfortunately for her she's just reaping what she sowed.", "NTA, whoever in your family disagrees can take her in.", "I am erring towards NTA, but just.

What I tell him is this\u2026(when a situation comes up), \u201cwhat can YOU live with?  (He does do things a bit differently now.  Does not cater to her constantly, etc.  plus he has a good buffer and sounding board in me).  It is not about your mother, it is about you.  Can you go to sleep at night knowing your mom needs help and doing nothing?  If that is ok for you, then all is good.  But if you think you will have regrets, then you might want to think about your options.   Overall, I am going to say, that because if the relationship you and your mom have, it is not a good idea.  Also, she is not only asking to live with you, but to take care of her husband, with dementia.  That is a whole other ball game there as well.", "Nta", "Hey, I\u2019m not sure about this. From my reading of it, on balance, I think YTA but so is your Mother.\n\nI will heavily caveat this by saying I don\u2019t know what that relationship is like I am literally just going off what you have written.\n\nI completely agree that they have been somewhat naive and selfish.\n\nHowever, I\u2019m not sure I could just flat out refuse to look after my mother in her time of need, even though it\u2019s self inflicted to a degree.\n\nIs them paying to live with you and you to help out an option? I\u2019m not suggesting you\u2019d be an asshole for not letting them, but it seems like a \u201cto teach her a lesson\u201d type thing. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any hope of teaching an 83 year old life lessons.\n\nI\u2019m sure people may disagree with me and it\u2019s not clear cut at all. I think had you been a bit less angry in your approach I would be saying the opposite.

How she treated you means something. And she didn\u2019t treat you well and spent her money  and now needs you \n\nI wouldn\u2019t let her live with you.

Inherited wealth exacerbates societal inequality.\n\nExpecting your kids to subsidize your decisions is a different issue.", "I don't quite see it that way - some families have disgusting levels of wealth (not just millions, but into the billions), so not leaving as big an inheritance and being upfront about it can motivate the kids to do well for themselves. \n\n\nI doubt OP's mum was that rich, and she does have the right to spend her money as she wishes. People who work hard for 40+ years should be able to spend their money as they wish, to make up for years of not being able to do so. \n\n\n The problem is more how she alienated her family, by treating them with contempt.

I think nobody could say anything about how OP's mom spent her money. But she had to have known she will need a reserve later on when she needs care in her old age.
