Where are you even getting that idea from? \n\nIf you really care about your marriage, I'd suggest you actually put the work into it.

One of the big reasons therapy doesn't work for some is because it doesn't meet you where you are. \n\nThere's a lot of time,patience, and understanding required.

A one sided problem in a relationship is still a relationship problem. It's not about you, it's about both of you. Listen to her, acknowledge her feelings, and go there together. You can share your problems there with her as well.\nYwbtah if you wouldn't go.", "YTA. You're proving her point by shutting down.

It shows that you don't care for any opinions or facts that don't align with what you think. My fiance was like that and I about damn near left him over it. I needed help with this or that and he didn't help and when I'd bring it up he just shut down. If I hadn't told him what your wife told you, \"change or I'll leave\" he would've never. We can discuss shit now and its hard and we still devolve into yelling sometimes but you're a grown ass man. You should know how to communicate with your wife. The fact that you think it's fine that you can't is pathetic.", "You're both assholes based on the limited information that's out there.  Is one of you a bigger asshole than the other?

Your in LALA land. If you go to therapy you need to actully DO therapy, not just sit there. If you didn't want to do the exercises, why go? If your not willing to do therapy then divorce your wife, she deserves better. Why should she be doing all the heavy lifting when as you stated, your the problem. You're the luckiest man on earth, having a wife who understands and is willing to help you, so why can't you help her in return, that's not love. You want a servant not a wife. \n\n2. That's not emotional black mail, which is pretty ironic since you seem to be emotionally blackmailing her, calling her big headed for trying to do what's best for you and the relationship. She gave you a CHOICE, that is your CHOICE to make. You can not do therapy and be single or you can do therapy and have a happy marriage for years down the line. She has been doing everything by the sounds of it, so it's about time you do your end of the deal too. If not, she can find someone else who can and you can find someone else who will probably also see those issues. Relationships don't fiction without communication.\n\n3. Every chance you get you downgrade and belittle your wife. The woman you chose to spend your life with, you belittle at every possible chance in those post. She has concerns, those concerns are enough to end a marriage over. You validate these concerns then contrast them by saying there not a big deal.

The only time you'll communicate is if she tells you something she has a complaint about, and then it's not even to address her complaint, but to shut her down with one of your own that you've been holding back. And then you make unilateral decisions that affect both of you.

Do you want to get divorced?\n\nWhen we learn how to take responsibility for ourselves, our emotions, and how we treat eachother, it\u2019s often very painful. It hurts to admit we are wrong. It also prohibits us from our usual coping mechanisms of deflection, blaming the other person, etc. Its a painful process. But! When we learn how to take responsibility for ourselves, we gain a great feeling of cleanliness in our actions. We gain a peaceful freedom and self confidence in knowing we can be kind and respectful to other people, and take joy in taking care of our own business. Seriously, it hurts to go through the process and unlearn our past defense systems that used to \u201cprotect\u201d us from the world. When you take responsibility for yourself, you will gain a great joy and freedom. Trust me, a random internet stranger! I know about this!\n\nI hope you try it. And I hope you listen to your wife.

Accept that you actually are the problem, and your wife and therapist are giving you an opportunity to grow and expand your personal freedom.

I hope you accept it!!! \n\nGood morning, cheer up, and have a super day!!!", "Maybe suggest to her that you do some individual therapy to get to the underlying reasons on why you shut down.

So do that! start there and tell her that's where you need to start. At least you're starting somewhere.  Eventually you need to get comfortable discussing your shortcomings with her, but baby steps are fine as long as there is progress.\n\nSo here's the deal - people often say \"oh I'd do anything for my wife\", I'm sure you've said that before too.  THIS is what she needs to do.  She doesn't need you to physically fight someone for her, she doesn't need you to work 80 hour shifts for her, she needs you to follow through on therapy so that you and her can live a long life together without any deep resentment forming.  \n\nSo will you actually do \"anything\"? or is this where you draw the line because \"anything\" actually turns out to be too difficult?\n\nKeep your eye on the prize.

I just want to keep saying- change is possible, it hurts, but the reward is GREAT. Good luck!!!", "You can't therapy private people. And no MSW or counselor can make that happen.
