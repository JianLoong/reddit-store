I (22F) have a three month old daughter with my boyfriend (M23). We are young and when I decided to have our daughter we had a talk and we came to the decision that there would be a lot of things we would have to change, less partying, no substances, limit drinking, etc. My boyfriend has always been a stoner, he started in early high school and although he has tried, he is not able to let go of his habit. I don\u2019t think he should do it at all since we are parents now but I also understand that sometimes people need to keep a certain sense of individuality and do things they enjoy. And so we came to a compromise, I told him that I won\u2019t care if he smokes when he goes out with his friends or at work. The only place he can\u2019t smoke is at home due to our baby. He said it was fair and that was that. A few weeks ago I started noticing the smell of his \u201cflowers\u201d in the bathroom but I didn\u2019t say anything. I would also sometimes smell his clothes since I do the laundry and they would have a faint smell of it too. I didn\u2019t say anything, however yesterday I was sitting with him in the couch and started caressing the side of his leg and I felt something, I took it out and it was a joint and his lighter, I got really upset because I told him not to smoke at home. He got mad and I told him that he was a liar and that he was weak. I told him that we had an agreement and that he was selfish for putting his addiction above all else. He started saying that I knew that he liked to smoke when I met him and I said that it didn\u2019t matter because we had come to a compromise. I then yelled out that I was breaking up with him and that he could go be a stoner without a future like he was before I moved in with him. The reason I said it was because he was kicked out of his parents house first and then his aunt\u2019s house for smoking. He also got kicked out of two jobs for failing a drug test. He said nothing and just left and has been avoiding my calls and being distant. I\u2019m starting to feel bad because he has been nothing but supportive ever since the pregnancy and now with the arrival of our daughter. He works a restaurant job and he cares a lot about our daughter. AITA? Should I apologize?\n\n\nEdit: \n\nA lot of you are asking about his usage. I do not mind if he wants to go out with his friends or if he wants to smoke every day. He is self sufficient and although his drug usage limits his work opportunities he still gets paid. However the only place I ask him not to smoke is inside the house. We both used to do substances together before our daughter, now that she is born I decided to completely cut off everything. I did not expect him to do the same, just to not do it inside the house.", "created_utc": 1697224935, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1776hla/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_he_can_go_back_to/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And who knows, maybe he hasn't been smoking in the house and she overreacted to what she thought was happening - but I think the principle stays the same, that you're NTA for not wanting your partner on drugs around your child.", "Thank you i didn\u2019t need to write this:)", "She said he works a restaurant job man. It seems more about her control issues and new mom panick than his explicit lack of responsabilities, unless he is failing as a dad too.\nIf being kicked out for not complying to social norms make people failures then so are gay young adults...", "Stoner doesn\u2019t mean loser. Losing two jobs due to smoking in the past and failing to keep promises to  the mother of your child who doesn\u2019t want someone high taking care of their daughter is loser behavior.", "Why is that? Because OP set up some rules for him? He does have a serious problem... an over-controlling judgemental GF.", "Op isn't married", "Hi, thank you for your comment. My boyfriend confessed that he had been smoking inside the house while I was asleep or when I was busy doing schoolwork. I would never just assume anything.", "Unless she's wrong about this:\n\n>he was kicked out of his parents house first and then his aunt\u2019s house for smoking. He also got kicked out of two jobs for failing a drug test\n\nI don't think it matters much if it's fair to call him an addict, if anything it is a more sympathetic framing than him just choosing not to stop to avoid being homeless and unemployed.", "No, her choosing to be with and more importantly procreate with him is her fault. Expecting people who have already shown you who they are to change because that's why you want to or expect is incredibly nieve and foolish.", "It took two to tango for making this kid", "She picked him", "There's also the fact you shouldn't be handling a baby after you've smoked. They absorb quite a lot through the skin and weed just like cigarettes has a tendency to stick to you and your clothes. Worse is we don't actually know all of the effects this might have on a baby because there just aren't as many studies on weed as there are on cigarettes. It's a genuine risk that shouldn't be taken lightly.", "We don't test people to see if they drink alcohol in their free time, why do we do that with pot?\n\nIt's stupid to smoke if you know you can be piss tested and fired over it, but it's also stupid to piss test  your employees and punishing them for harmless activities done outside of work time.", "I was talking more about the part where he keeps getting kicked out of his house and fired from his job over it, but what do I know. The feelz are what really matters.", "Oh okay then, NTA\n\nHe f*ed up and got found out. OP you were 100% justified in your decision to enforce your boundary.\n\nBUT I am a bit worried though, is the father still around for the kid ? ( Did he call for news about the kid or is he not answering to anyone like his friends or parents ? ) While I don't want to assume the worst, the sooner he gives information about him being safe and sound, the better.", "Thank you. I came here to say this to u/darthganji, but you already did.  \nPerhaps she missed the part at the beginning when OP said,\n\n>My boyfriend has always been a stoner, he started in early high school and although he has tried, he is not able to let go of his habit.\n\nSounds like daddy material to me. I mean, what woman wouldn't want to have this guy as father to her children?", ">We don't test people to see if they drink alcohol in their free time,\n\nMany places do, especially in industries where you drive long distance or operate heavy machinery. Many jobs do random piss tests, they are also checking for alcohol to see if you are drinking or arrived drunk to the job. There are minesites where you have to blow a 0.0 to enter the site. The only difference is alcohol works its way out of your system faster.", "I agree with you. But it\u2019s hard to not put blame on the individual for taking a job that is weed free, then getting fired for smoking. You learn the rules of the job day one.", "We don't really know any of the details, it could be he had a mom that kicked him out at 14, and then an ant who told him a 22 he had to move out. As for the jobs, they could of been high-school jobs. \n\nAlso, he is 23, how many 23 year Olds have there life together?", "There are plenty of excellent fathers who use marijuana responsibly. \n\nIf the guy is a shit dad, it\u2019s because his character allows such, not because weed is intrusively evil.", "Yesss this 100% she knew who he was and expected him to change? At 23??? lol \ud83d\ude02", "I worked in an industry that is heavily tested. There were multiple times I had to go get tested right after lunch. That was always a breathalyzer and rarely included piss. \n\nAs far as random testing, one place I just started at, I was randomly tested 6 times in 4 weeks. Then, never tested again.", ">Many places do\n\nTo be fair, pot stays in your system for weeks after one use, alcohol not so much.", "It could be, but that would be an extremely unusual thing to be complaining about.\n\nI don't think the point is that 23 year olds are expected to have their lives together, it's that if you have a baby, you are expected to get your life together, and fast - and it sounds like this guy isn't interested in doing that. Trust me, I've known plenty of people who loved their kids and still loved to party, and typically that ends with the couple splitting up and everybody struggling.", "He\u2019s 23 and she\u2019s 22. He wants to party and smoke pot she thought having a kid would change that? Life is gonna come hard for these people"]}
