A lot of people seem to feel that those two are bound together.\n\nYou, fianc\u00e9, and the rest of the family need to have a plan for when (not if) he shows up.

Do you plan with your family to only call him \"Cheater\" instead of his name? \n\nIt's clear he doesn't respect boundaries in general and your fianc\u00e9's family in particular, so you need to have this agreed to and in place ahead of time.\n\nGood luck, and congrats on the wedding!
