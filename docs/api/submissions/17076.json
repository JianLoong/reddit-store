I (21M at the time) was at a party with some friends for something I don\u2019t even remember. One of my friends (21F at the time) I had a crush on since the start of college. I never tried anything because she was either with someone at the time or I wasn\u2019t right in my headspace. So while we were at this party, me and my friends all had some drink and were a little tipsy, but not blackout drunk. She at one point asked me to accompany her to her apartment to make sure nothing happens to her, and I agreed to it, because I cared about her safety. We get a ride to her apartment which was like 5-10 minutes away from the party. When we both got to her apartment building, we were sobering up and I was about to walk home since I lived at around the same area, like a 6 minute walk. \n\nBut as I\u2019m about to go, she asks me if I want to hang out and have a drink before I go. I said sure, since we were close and always had deep conversations in the past. After we get to her apartment and we sit down for a drink, we start talking and after a while, she starts making out with me. I\u2019m taken back and reciprocate back. One thing led to another, and we had sex that night, and I\u2019m gonna be honest, she was my first ever. I\u2019m not afraid to admit that I was a late bloomer, I was never good juggling school and relationships, so I chose school. After that night, we acknowledged what happened and there were no regrets from either one of us, but we agreed to never bring it up again.\n\nNext year at school was tough because the feelings I had for her were stronger than ever and she was just going from guy to guy. She graduated ahead of me and the. I didn\u2019t really hear from her again, except from a group chat with our friends. But our friendship has been strained for a long time now.\n\nA few days ago, she messaged me out of the blue asking if she wants to get a drink or something, saying that she has missed me. A little fact I found out was that she just recently broke up with her long term boyfriend of 3.5 years. I haven\u2019t responded and don\u2019t think I will take her up on that since I\u2019ve worked so hard to move on and to be clear headed for my mental health, but I also feel bad because I don\u2019t want to come off as a douche or an asshole for not accepting or responding back. I don\u2019t know what to do, but would I be an asshole for doing this?", "created_utc": 1683903310, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fnffo/aita_for_not_responding_to_a_i_miss_you_text_from/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
