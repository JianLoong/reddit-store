I was told I should and also should not talk about this stuff with coworkers.) So, she mentions to me a couple days ago she almost cried when she found out how much she made. Without fully thinking, I tell her how much I make. Then we start talking about how it isn't fair to her that I make more than her. Then today, when I came into work, my manager asked me if I could cover her shift this week. I agreed, and I asked what happened to her. They told me she quit. I've been feeling really guilty about all this, because it very much feels like my fault. I genuinely had no intentions to start something I only had good intentions in telling her how much I make.

In the US you have a federal right to discuss your wages for this very reason. They\u2019re only mad because they can no longer cheat that poor woman out of fair pay", "NTA- don\u2019t feel guilty none of this is your fault when a company says don\u2019t discuss wages with coworkers it usually because they are heavily underpaying older employees she quit and most likely has found a better job", "NTA.\n\nYou legally have the right to discuss your compensation. \n\nEmployers try to make you feel guilty for that because it makes it harder for them to exploit workers. \n\nIf an employer makes a big deal about not talking about salary with your co-workers, that's a good sign that *somebody* at the company is getting screwed. It's telling you something about your employer that you should remember when it comes to negotiating your own salary.", "NTA you were being honest and did her a favor. Employer is to blame for paying her less.", "NTA. You should feel happy that she didn't put up with the low wages, not sad that the company loses out.", "NTA\n\nNot discussing wages between employees is a way employers use to keep underpaying their staff. Info is power, share it!!!", "NTA You did her a huge favor, honestly. I'm glad she gets the opportunity to work for a different job that might have more fair wages", "NTA- not your fault, it\u2019s the companies fault. however if they felt you had more experience in that industry or say you have a college degree and that\u2019s why they decided to pay you more, then it is more than fair that you get paid more", "NTA. I don't know if it's illegal to discuss employee wages where you are but, if it isn't, you absolutely should. More information about your compensation, your co-worker's compensation, your bosses' compensation, all of that aids workers in being able to negotiate for their worth. \n\nSounds like your co-worker discovered her worth and that your company wasn't appreciating that. If anything, you did her a favor.", "NTA-companies prefer that employees not compare notes. It allows them to unfairly compensate employees based on whatever. Their goal is to pay as little as possible. Employees should compare wages more. You aren\u2019t responsible for your coworker quitting g-you May have done her a favor.", "NTA. It's never wrong to discuss salaries openly, especially in situations like this where there is a clear disparity. Employers discourage it to prevent what happened with your coworker. She found out she was treated unfairly and made the decision to leave.", "NTA poor lady. How sad for her.", "NTA you did her a favor and in the us it\u2019s your right to share your salary if you want", "NTA! Not only do you have the legal right to discuss your wages, ethically you\u2019re in the right too. Lack of pay equity is a huge problem that disproportionately affects POC and women. You did a good thing. Your coworker left because she wasn\u2019t being paid her worth and it\u2019s good you told her.\n\nETA: I should say the legal right to discuss wages in the U.S. I can\u2019t speak to other country\u2019s laws.", "NTA More people should discuss their wages, companies screw so many people over.\n\nDon't feel too bad for her, she's likely moved on to a job that has oferred a higher wage now that she knows what she's worth.", "[deleted]", "Keep that information to yourself it never ends well.

Federal laws protect us thankfully.", "It\u2019s also illegal and reportable.", "Yeah I couldn\u2019t disagree more. There is no good reason why you should not discuss wages. Had they not discussed with their coworker, she would still be getting cheated by the company", "There are federal laws to protect us when discussing wages at work, it\u2019s against the company\u2019s interest to discuss them.  Always discuss them with coworkers and fight for good pay.", "Or the one being cheated can get themselves a more fair paying job?", "And if you say nothing, then nobody knows they're being grossly undervalued, so they don't have the opportunity to try to make it right. You don't have to share your pay rate with your coworkers, but keeping it secret benefits your company far more than you.", "Nobody benefits from staying quiet except the boss who's screwing somebody.", "There are federal laws that allow you to discuss your wages to make sure everyone is valued appropriately, use those laws to your advantage if they try to discipline you for discussing wages, you get to sue the shit out of them.  Keeping it to yourself is a company lie to make sure they can pay people less.", "Absolutely NTA. The COMPANY is the AH for underpaying your ex-coworker. You gave her back her power, and hopefully she can work somewhere that pays her what she deserves now. The only people who lose when coworkers talk about their wages are the people who want to take advantage of them not knowing if they're being underpaid.", "NAH, in fact you may have saved her from getting low balled and inspired her to seek work where she\u2019s compensated fairly", "NTA your work was taking advantage her. Employers don't want workers to compare wages because people who do more but make less will then ask for correct compensation. She quit because she found out you made more then her, despite experience. She asked for a raise, they told her no. Be happy with what you get and she quit. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA - If she quit over the wage disparity, that\u2019s something the company had within their power to fix and chose not to. She was likely suspicious when she asked anyway & looking for confirmation.\n\nYou absolutely should discuss wages with coworkers, and I hope your former coworker finds a position where she is valued appropriately.\n\nThe management/company is TA for trying to play the employees off each other.", "You are NEVER the asshole for discussing your salary with a coworker. Your coworker was being cheated out of fair pay, taken advantage of and treated badly, and you gave her the information she needed to realize that. That's a great thing! She's now in a better and more informed position, and based on that, she's decided not to be taken advantage of anymore. Your employers might be upset but only because they got caught doing something shitty. You're all good.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - She didn't quit because you told her how much you make, she quit because she found out how much the company was underpaying her. You ultimately did her a solid.", "NTA NTA NTA NTA.  More people SHOULD discuss their wages.  The only reason companies can get away with underpaying certain employees is because for some reason we've been conditioned to think it's \"rude\" to discuss our pay.  Your coworker quit because she realized that your company grossly undervalues her, but thanks to you, she can now go into her job search armed with a much better idea of what she's worth.", "NTA. Management underpaid her. Good for her to quit.", "Yep, companies have grilled it into our heads that it\u2019s \u201cinappropriate\u201d to discuss wages, but the only reason for that is because if we realize there are discrepancies we\u2019ll want better pay. They want us under their thumb", "NTA, always discuss your wages with co workers to stop yourselves from getting fucked.", "NTA u told her the truth", "NTA - Bosses have worked very hard over the years to make people feel that discussing wages is taboo. \n\nIt isn\u2019t.\n\nDiscussing wages with coworkers is absolutely necessary to prevent exploitation. It absolutely wasn\u2019t fair that your coworker was making less than you despite working there longer and having more experience. Now your bosses have lost a good worker because they took her for granted. None of that is your fault.", "NTA. They don\u2019t want you discussing wages so they can underpay your elderly coworkers. You\u2019re NTA. The company sucks for not in reading her wage leading her to quit.", "NTA companies try to stop people discussing it so that they can exploit people .\n\nthis woman stood up for herself and in fairness in the UK if you're doing the same job she could have sued them / gone to tribunal for ageism and sexism.", "NTA. She quit because she was under paid, you did her a favor. You don't owe the company shit.", "NTA\nThis is why we should discuss wages.", "No you're  not. However,  in the future, keep your financial matters to yourself...", "NTA. It wasn\u2019t your fault you were just being honest. I wish I would have stayed at my last company that was guilty of this because I could have sued them for discrimination. They were paying brand new people with no where near the experience more than $5 an hour than I was being paid. I was there six years and there were people there for much longer probably getting paid chicken feed compared to new people. \n\nWhen my coworker informed me she was being paid almost $25/hr when I had a BA, a CMA and six years of experience being paid $16/hr for work including cleaning up toilet waste? I quit. I was tired of the company because it was toxic. Also they operated on favoritism. I was desperately wanting to finish my masters but they never gave me the time of day for my internship but gave it to someone who just started with the company. It should be illegal. I can\u2019t do anything about it since I quit however. \n\nJust glad to be with a good company this time (hopefully) but honestly all seem to be the same way so I don\u2019t trust anyone.", "What do the hyperlinks mean?", "You\u2019re NTA you did her a favor, hearing your wage was probably the last straw for her and made her realize the company was messing her over", "Nta - you just made her realise she's been undervalued and now will start looking for a new job. If anything, I'd be thankful, because a lot of people avoid this topic and will not tell you how much they make.", "It is your fault that she now has a reference to know how much she should be paid, but that is a good thing. NTA", "NTA -discussion pay is one of the ways we can protect ourselves from companies that are taking advantage of people who didn't know better when they signed on. The company is the A for not paying her what she was worth", "NTA.\n\nThey knew they need to offer more for the position. You\u2019re new, so you need incentive to accept the job over another company. She has been there, so they know they have her already. Raise her pay (or don\u2019t) just enough to keep her, but not pay her her worth. \n\nYou\u2019re also a man, and there\u2019s a fair bit of lowballing given to women, but especially to BIPOC or disabled women. \n\nThe company screwed her over. Quitting or asking for more money was her next move, and she decided that the company didn\u2019t value her enough to keep giving her loyalty. \n\nI hope she goes on to find a great job or retire as she deserves.", "NTA. Talk about wages, don't get pushy if they don't want to. Be free and open.", "NTA. Ultimately, you did her a favour.", "NTA - quite the opposite.  You did her a favor in letting her know that her job did not value her, so she can find some place that will.  If anyone is TA, it's the company for paying a new hire more than the existing staff for the same job.", "NTA - always discuss salaries, it\u2019s the only way to figure out if you\u2019re truly being underpaid in comparison to peers, and it\u2019s a clear way to say it\u2019s time to find another job if the company won\u2019t match.", "I don't think salary discussions are an issue of being an AH or not. It is a matter of personal preference. In the US these discussions are less common, even if it is your right, and you should read the room before doing so.\n\nIt can very easily be a \"no good deed goes unpunished\" scenario. There are some real AHs in the professional world, who can take this info and try to weaponize it against you. Instead of some coworkers using this information as a tool to help them in their own negotiations, it can sadly create jealousy, resentment and hostility against the coworker instead of the company who assigns wages.\n\nI've seen it first hand - especially with people who then feel entitled to whatever compensation that their coworkers receive or more, despite lacking appropriate qualitications, training, certifications, skillsets experience etc.....  So, in short, share or don't share. It's your choice. Just know that your coworkers are not your friends.", "Most laws are also a right to work state and you are going to have trouble proving why they fired you"]}
