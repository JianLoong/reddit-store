(Nothing wrong with that, I\u2019m saying it\u2019s obviously a long standing thing and you must know this kid very well, yet she\u2019s never met him).  Yet you forgot to mention the twice a week habit that he comes over\u2026.seems weird.   Your fianc\u00e9e wasn\u2019t wrong to initially wonder what happened\u2026.she walks in, never met him, they\u2019re asleep under covers.   You didn\u2019t tell her they\u2019re allowed and are often alone in the house, so she thinks they\u2019re trying to get away with something while you\u2019re off at work everyday.    \n\nShould she have calmed down?   I have no doubt, but, initial what the heck is going on is NOT out of bounds.   Then his parents want to talk to you and insist she not be there\u2026I would ask for the opposite\u2026she should be allowed to meet them, explain and (hopefully) apologize, which may be why she\u2019s insulted she\u2019s not being afforded that important opportunity.
