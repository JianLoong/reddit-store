(Nothing wrong with that, I\u2019m saying it\u2019s obviously a long standing thing and you must know this kid very well, yet she\u2019s never met him).  Yet you forgot to mention the twice a week habit that he comes over\u2026.seems weird.   Your fianc\u00e9e wasn\u2019t wrong to initially wonder what happened\u2026.she walks in, never met him, they\u2019re asleep under covers.   You didn\u2019t tell her they\u2019re allowed and are often alone in the house, so she thinks they\u2019re trying to get away with something while you\u2019re off at work everyday.    \n\nShould she have calmed down?   I have no doubt, but, initial what the heck is going on is NOT out of bounds.   Then his parents want to talk to you and insist she not be there\u2026I would ask for the opposite\u2026she should be allowed to meet them, explain and (hopefully) apologize, which may be why she\u2019s insulted she\u2019s not being afforded that important opportunity.

You checked the camera feed (side note: how creepy is it you have a camera feed?) and basically stood her to task while you gave her a dressing down, called her a child, then dismissed her so you could talk to the other grown ups. \n\nAnd I get that she majorly over reacted and you need to figure out new rules and stuff, but grown ups really, really, REALLY flipping hate it when they think they're being treated like kids. \n\nSo now you're going to have a difficult situation made more difficult because she's resentful of you, and itching to either make you feel sorry or reassert that she has equal authority. \n\nFigure out how to talk to her, grown up to grown up, and resolving this will go smoother.", "NTA Except if you do not \"kick her out of her home\" permanently.

You know the dynamic best and I agree its wise to be careful. I'm not one to call the police but I needed someone to know I was leaving because at the end of the day you cant know how they'll react.

If the Titanic had hit the iceberg head on, it would only have flooded two or three compartments, and once they closed them off it would probably have been able to keep going as it was made to be able to withstand four compartments flooding.
