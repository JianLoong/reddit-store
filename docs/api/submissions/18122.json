My sister and I are both this way and learned it from our parents who really set us up for success. However, I have a rule that special occasions have special exceptions. For example, I really limit my kid's junk food intake, but during holidays and on vacations I allow him to moderate himself. This is the source of my conflict with my sister.\n\nOn our recent vacation there was this machine with unlimited ice cream. My sister didn't let her daughter use the machine. I told my son no being wasteful (don't get it just to get it when you are full and then throw it out after a few licks) but that was the only restriction. My niece would pout whenever my son had ice cream and was in a pretty bad mood basically the entire time. My son offered to share his ice cream, but my sister said no really harshly, which we had a minor argument about, because I don't think it's okay to use a harsh voice with a kid outside of extreme circumstances or if they are being intentionally defiant.\n\nMy sister says that I ruined her vacation. She didn't get a single good picture with her daughter. She showed me the pics and my niece is sulking in all of them. My husband said he understands where she is coming from, and he himself had some reservations about letting our son eat so much junk.\n\nMy sister earlier today told me I am a selfish person raising a spoiled child.

There was an ice cream sundae option, which she loved, but it wasn't very big. It was the kind that came in a fancy glass. She was still upset she never got to try the soft serve though.", "He didn't waste any, like I told him. He probably had three to four cones a day? They weren't massive cones. He had a bunch the first day because he was so excited by the novelty of a machine that just (his words) \"poops out all the ice cream anyone could ever want!\" After that though he only got some a few times a day because the novelty wore off a bit.\n\nI let him pick his meals at the buffets. The rule was he needs to eat a full plate of real food and then he can pick as many desserts as he likes (but no wasting). He tried lots of new foods he'd never had before. At dinner the same rule, eat your food then have dessert. My husband, son and I would just order all the desserts we thought looked good and share them.\n\nHe was really well behaved. He was excited by how new and different everything was. He loved the pool. He loved the games. He loved meeting other children. He even made a friend!

Object permanence what?)", "Wasn\u2019t she allowed to choose soft serve as her dessert for the day?

Your parenting sounds smarter. Kids of overly strict parents sometimes go overboard when they finally get to make their own decisions.

It\u2019s fine to have whatever rules you want to have for your kids (so long as it\u2019s not unreasonably restrictive to the point of being harmful), but as soon as the kids are exposed to other kids who may not have those same rules, they\u2019ll be upset!

The number 2 job of parents (after keeping their kids healthy/safe) is to teach them how to be adults. When niece is 18 is she supposed to suddenly know what to eat, how much, and when? Or will she be waiting for mommy to meal prep for her? If anything OP is further along bc she\u2019s providing her kid structure at home during (presumably) school time and letting him learn moderation on vacation."]}
