The rule was he needs to eat a full plate of real food and then he can pick as many desserts as he likes (but no wasting). He tried lots of new foods he'd never had before. At dinner the same rule, eat your food then have dessert. My husband, son and I would just order all the desserts we thought looked good and share them.\n\nHe was really well behaved.

Your sister and yourself had a really odd childhood. Not having any junk food? Also, how is ice cream junk food? What kind of ice cream do you have? It's made of milk and fruit, nuts or plants (cinnamon, vanilla, etc). How is that unhealthy?\n\nBesides that, not letting a child have access to \"junk food\" will only make them crave it more and eat loads of it behind your backs. You need to teach them how to balance food. All kinds of food. You can get a big sheet and spend time with your child creating a food pyramid.

You can do what you want, but you'd be an A H in my opinion if you got up and banged around getting breakfast etc while they tried to sleep in. It would be considerate to be quieter than you normally would, not because your rule/habit is unreasonable but because you are sharing space.   \n\n\nSo similar situation, okay you let your kid have junk food while on vacation but apparently you are also okay with watching your niece sulk and not have a good time because of it.

The only one responsible for her lack of fun and ice cream is your sister. She\u2019s to blame for her ruined vacation not you.

I think it's beyond reasonable that if you raise you're kids relatively strict that there are exceptions (vacations, grandma's house, etc).  Not having an outlet to enjoy certain things ever just leads to overconsumption as an adult when there are no more strict rules, and probably the child going NC.  Strict is different for many people, but ice cream on vacation?  Tell her to pound sand.", "That poor little girl didn't get to use the machine even one time?  Man, that is mean.  I used to work with a girl who's parents never let them have sweets, and I mean never.  For her birthday they cut a watermelon in half and stuck candles in it.  She did not have a good relationship with food.  Then she had a kid and all she fed him was junk food and sweets, because that was what she wanted most in childhood she wanted him to have everything that she couldn't.  So her parents not only messed her up but their grandkids too.

Did you see their comment that the kid was having 4 cones a day and even more on the first day? I mean, come on! Is there no common decency these days?", "Yes! And this comes up all the time simply within the context of parenting your kids differently than your kids' friends are being parented. We are moderate with our kids on pretty much everything. Our son has a friend whose parents are super lenient on everything. We have decided that it is worth navigating the differences because the friend and his family are wonderful people we are grateful to have in our son's life.

And why go out for the ice cream when there was a perfectly alright one within reach? \nWhat other precedent will this set? It isn't always about the immediate and this was a vacation. \n\nOp can as well turn it and go- why not let your child indulge? Why do they have to have 2 sulking children? The sister was asking Op to parent her child the way SHE parents. \n\nAlso,\nWhy is the sister teaching her child to sneak behind her back in the future, to have what she wants?", "Sounds like sister is more focused on her daughter\u2019s appearance than her well-being. The idea that a child is \u2018spoiled\u2019 for having a bit of ice-cream is extremely concerning too. What else is this poor girl being deprived of? I would be questioning how else sister\u2019s need for control is impacting her daughter\u2019s life and whether she\u2019s crossed over from strict to abusive.", "Yup. I lived this. We were banned from sugar a lot as a kid, and as soon as I had a modicum of freedom I binged for *years*. It took me years to unlearn habits I formed at 17-19. \n\nTeaching your kids about moderation in all things is important before they leave the house.", "I agree, the \"don't be wasteful\" thing is gold! It makes the kid pause to consider whether his eyes are bigger than his stomach, and is a practical lesson in moderation. OP is actively teaching her kid moderation using this technique. \n\nSame with the \"only on vacation rule\" - reinforces good habits, but sets aside specific times to let loose, so there is no confusion about when to follow which rule. This is also a great rule to continue to follow as an adult, to keep healthy as your body ages. \n\nI'm impressed with OP's parenting, and it's sad that her sister is more concerned about being right than in learning. Being flexible and picking up new tips along the way is what parenting is all about, so if sister is this rigid, she needs to get that sorted out before her daughter ends up with food issues. It kinda seems like the kid is already getting food issues - she was miserable the whole vacation over ice cream. I don't blame the kid of course, but it's an indication that this is a bigger issue than just a few ice creams."]}
