Let your grandparents know how much it hurts what your aunt and cousins are doing.  Try and understand that they are in a predicament with juggling their different roles.

Because if you cancel, it could be many months before there is another availability. If there are lots of availability and your grandparents specifically made the appointment when they knew they would miss the lunch and made an appointment at the same time, that could be a show of favoritism. Or if every time she mentioned an achievement, you or your grandparents countered by talking about yourself, that could be favoritism. \n\nAlso, a lot of places in the world, when the receiver of an estate goes to a minor, are put in a trust until the receiver becomes a legal adult. And oftentimes, the trust can be withdrawn from to pay for necessities for the minor as well. And where I am, the auto insurance would have to pay for your prosthetics for life. I'm not sure if any of that could be applicable to you. But if it is, then your grandparents wouldn't be paying for the prosthetic, so the argument about them spending more on you would be moot. Or if they received your parents' estate, the money should be spent on costs to take care of you again, making the point moot. \n\nIf I were in your shoes, I would ask her if she wants to trade - parents, leg, and seeing your brother regularly vs having more attention from grandparents.
