I used to share a room with  my sister, and I hated it, but when the family went on vacation, sharing a room was great fun.\n\nI am just saying that the mother is stirring up trouble, when there is an easy solution.

Now I have 2 left at home, and they have their own rooms and continuously go stay at their older siblings' places, and they all sleep on the couches so they can spend time together. \n\nOP isn't doing anything wrong. The kids will decide on their own when they want their own space.", "Yeah, my 5 & 8yo just told me the other day that they want to both sleep in 8yo's room so 5yo's room can be a Lego Play Room (they currently each have their legos in their own rooms but frequently they are both in one room or another playing together, and this way we could put both their legos tables together to make a 4'x 6' table...) I'm sure in ~3 years my elder one will want his own room again, but we're currently in the middle of picking up and organizing all the loose legos as the first step to combining the rooms, because whatever, if they want to share a \"sleeping\" room we'll indulge that as long as they want.\n\nKids have control over so little in their life, something that doesn't cost anything but a bit of time organizing stuff that needed it anyway is a small price for them to fee in control of their world!", "You are an amazing parent!", "NTA. I think it\u2019s great you\u2019re supporting what they want while still keeping the guest room open as an option for if they ever decide they want their own rooms. I wouldn\u2019t have done it differently.", "nta, they'll want their own rooms eventually, let them enjoy this time now.", "NTA.I am an actual twin, me and my twin are incredibly close we shared a room for qite some time bevore a wall was put up in the middle with a door so we don't have to leave our rooms to go to the other one. We are 23 now, we have friends, my twin studies in a duffrent town and moved out, we have our own lives and aren't codependend, we are just best friends an knew our whole live no matter what happens and even if we aren't sure how our parents feel abut certain issues we will always have each other. Being this close with a sibling is the best thing that can happen between siblings, and no matter how close they are at some point they are going to have their own lives and they are going to want privacy in their own room, at least sometimes, except for sleeping we can still be found in one of our rooms together when my twin is home evry other weekend.", "This is the second time in the last 3 hours I am reading about separating kids because of codependency. What kid of rubbish are people spewing in the name of codependency? Isn't it good the sisters have a good bond and actually like each other? Is it really so bad to have two humans seek out friendship on a non-tomantic way? Have the people totally forgotten how it is to have a best friend? What is with the trend to keep separating kids because of codependency??\n You should celebrate that the siblings love each other.\nTotally NTA.", "As someone who\u2019s not super close to their sibling due to the age difference, this is really nice that your kids get along that well!! NTA, ex seems to have a weirdly skewed version of healthy siblings.", "Nta. \n\nMy oldest boys are also 20mo apart and they are 14 and 15 and still share a room. By request. At their dads they do not.", "NTA. Its sweet your kids want to share a room. There is nothing co-dependent in that.", "NTA. This hurts no one and it\u2019s really sweet that they still want to share.", "NTA plus do u think it is time to maybe consider a custody change?", "Your ex is way out of line.\n\nI don't really see the point in wanting them to sleep separately. They enjoy it, specifically asked for that and it's pretty clear it's helping their sisterly bond.\n\nNTA and keep up the good work with your daughters, you're a good parent for standing up for their wishes.", "NTA. When my parents built my childhood home, they cut a hole in the wall between my and my sister's rooms so we could have a window to talk through at night. It was awesome and I feel blessed to have a childhood memory like that. It's good that your kids love each other and want to spend time together.", "Your ex is being ridiculous.  NTA", "NTA If they're happy doing it and want to do it, what's the harm? In your last paragraph it's clear that there are no dependency issues, they simply enjoy each other's companies as siblings often do. Honestly? It's pretty cute! I do suggest, however, that you are prepared for that to change in a few years time and they'll want their own room and private space when they become tweens/teens lol but yeah nta :)", "It is rare that a child's two houses offer identical facilities. Your wife should calm down and maybe spend a little time working that out for herself: what's better about your place, what's better about hers. Remember, it's her choice to make it a competition. She doesn't have to make a stink about this: does she want you to share her behavior and the things she's saying with your daughters? It might be useful for you to work out what's REALLY bugging her about this. NTA\n\nIncidentally, when they get a couple years older, they will seriously want more private space for studying and class work. This is a special time in their lives, and years from now they will cherish the memories.", "same here, my sister and I are best friends because we grew up sharing a room. NTA", "Yeah my boys are 3years apart and really close (like \"hold eachothers hands at school so they don't get separated from eachother during end of day rush\" close) and they shared a from up until 2years ago (now 10&7) the only reasons we had to separate them was 1 the fighting over clean up and 2 the eldest would wake his little brother upas soon as he woke up at dawn.\n\nThey are still close and have been able to share a room when needed (3mths last year). I agree with OP as long as they are getting along, leave them be. But your also right, fights happen and the more time they spend together the more likely they are going to happen so mum should either shut up or let the girls room together so nature can take its course (either they will end up fighting or become really close and always have eachothers backs)."]}
