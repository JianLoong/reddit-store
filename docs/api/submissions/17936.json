It pisses me off when kids are clear about what they want and adults think they know better (I'm not talking about dangerous or stupid stuff, but things that help their own wellbeing). Good on you for listening to your children, it will only make your relationship with them stronger.", "NTA", "NTA. If your daughters kept wanting to share rooms, let them! I am so glad to see them being so close even if they have different things in their lives. When it comes to your house, it's your rules and your daughters have set up boundaries as well. I am glad you are respecting their relationships. Your ex needs to understand that she can't force the same rules when it comes to parenting and in different households.", "Listen to your kids. My cousins were like this, too. My nephews shared a room when they were little. They would end up in the same bed more times than not. They are still close as adults. It\u2019s so endearing. Your ex is insane. NTA", "NTA Your girls are happy and want to share a room.  No problem with that.  In fact, it's great they're still so close. Your ex is the one with a problem in this situation.  Your girls seem perfectly well adjusted, so why is she freaking out that they want to sleep in the same room at the end of the day?  She might be projecting something from her childhood on them? \n\nAnyway, if they're happy, and you're happy and they know if/when they're ready to have their own space, it's there, I say carry on!! You could even go all out sometimes and have a family \"sleepover\" in the living room.

When my sisters were given separate rooms, they spent the next year taking turns  whose bedroom they slept in together.", "This just seems petty. I have two boys 3 years apart. We\u2019ve had separate rooms and shared rooms. Once, we got some bunk beds and put them in the smallest bedroom with their dressers and clothes and put all their fun stuff in the other larger room for a play room. Currently, they have separate rooms, but sleep together in one on weekend nights when there\u2019s no school. None of this really is a big deal. NTA", "NTA. They'll be at each other's throats in just a couple years. Enjoy them getting along!", "NTA I have two brothers both much younger than me their sister. They shared a room till the older one was about 13. They found it more comfortable that way when young. Loved the bunk bed and got along well despite being 2 years apart. As teenagers they needed and wanted their own space and this may happen as your girls get older but there is no issue now.", "My house, my rules, what happened to that?", "NTA\n\nYour kids *want* to share a room.

They get to be happy at your house where you respect their wishes.", "NTA - as a child of divorced parents (I was 10), the worst thing was my parents doing awful shit to us just to spite the other parent.\n\nYou\u2019re doing a harmless thing that makes your kids happy. Your ex is definitely TA for not minding her business.", "I (23M) have 3 sisters (25F, 19F, 12F). When I grew up, I had to share a room with my older and middle sis. For a while, my sisters all shared the same room as well. \n\nAs a result, everyone was close to one another. We'd even stay up at midnight and talk about dreams and life. Back in 2020, our parents converted our upstairs into a duplex so everyone has their own room. I'm unsure how often we talk to each other (prob not as much but still often) as we all have different lives now but those memories will always be there.\n\nNTA. If they're happy w/ the situation, let 'em be. I get your ex's concerns but they will likely develop that as time goes.", "That's it exactly, she doesn't want them getting excited about going to their fathers. She see's what is coming and is afraid she will lose their love.", "If Ex wasn't trying to control this, it would likely be something else.\n\n\"Veruca, on matters like this we no longer need to agree. I've told the girls you get to have different rules at your house, that's all I owe you. The issue is closed.\"", "Same with my brother. Sharing a room teaches you... Sharing! NTA. Tell her you don't want your kids sharing the toilet, the car or the table during lunch there.", "Sounds like the ex doesn\u2019t want them more happy at his place", "And all she would have to do is let them share a room at her place, and the girls could be happy all the time.
