It takes time to find someone who will watch multiple kids and then it takes time to establish trust. Time *and* money - teenagers in my area get paid at least $20 an hour. Someone being paid to *watch* a teenager is going to want even more.\n\nI think most people can find good and reliable paid childcare in the same way most people can find a good job.

Childcare should only be performed by choice.", "There's a lot of scaremongering about CSA going around. I don't often get a babysitter unless the babysitter is well vetted by multiple people within my network - it's not exactly that I'm scared of the *risk*, but there's also a kind of judgement against parents if they \"chance it\".\n\nI know that every time I send out feelers about whether any of my neighbours teenagers would be willing to babysit, one neighbour who used to be a health visitor stops me on the street soon after to warn me that \"you don't know who anyone is\" - as if I'd hand off my kid to a random without even asking any questions?\n\nI think that there are more young people (I.e. the people who, in previous generations, would have been the people babysitting) who have little to no contact with younger kids, and wouldn't know what to do with them. Getting older teenagers to look after their younger siblings is \"parentification\" now, even if they're paid for it. \n\nWe also don't necessarily have the community bonds that let you trust your neighbours with your kids - whether that be the younger kid that needs babysitting, or the older kid who would be in a \"stranger's\" house.", "Right. If it\u2019s not that 16 year old it\u2019s be another teen sitting for the younger kids. Would that still be \u201cabuse\u201d? Of course not.", "With the way sister sounds, if OP relents with letting the 16 year old come, it\u2019ll be \u201cbut why can\u2019t the other two come?? They\u2019ll behave! They\u2019re gonna be jealous of their sibling getting to go so you have to invite them!!\u201d And then it turns into a whole shitshow", "My guess is she wants nice (and free) professional pictures of the kids. My wedding photographer says one of her biggest pet peeves is when guests ask her to take \u201cquick\u201d family pictures that the bride and groom haven\u2019t asked for.", "The teen wasn\u2019t singled out. No minors are invited.\n\nAt 16 she\u2019s old enough to babysit. It shouldn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s for neighbors, family friends, or siblings. If she has plans and can\u2019t, the step sister can hire a different teen.\n\nMoney is still money.", "I don\u2019t this an older sibling should be obligated to babysit younger ones. They still need their social life. But it\u2019s it\u2019s a paying job and the older one is available then that\u2019s great. \nOn the rare occasion, you might enlist their help but don\u2019t expect. \nYes, don\u2019t have more kids, expecting the older one to be a 3rd parent.", "It\u2019s a win/win if they want to and are available.

Babysitting is a job that the 16 yrold presumably never applied for. Also stepsister is under no obligation to go to the wedding.

I don\u2019t see that has restricting people. It\u2019s a guest list that often needs to be cut off somewhere.\n\nI didn\u2019t see other comments about the teen not wanting to sit. My presumption was that it\u2019s an option. Step sister might be a helicopter type that doesn\u2019t trust her daughter.", "We don\u2019t know if the teen is willing to sit her siblings for this or not. The general presumption that she is just automatically available for that at request is gross and entitled and that\u2019s my issue with the comments section here. \n\nHave whatever wedding size you want. Not inviting people isn\u2019t a restriction. Not inviting children is a restriction for this invitees with children.  In a nutshell, if you make it difficult for people to attend, don\u2019t expect them to attend. If my sibling invited me to their wedding but my child/their nibling was not allowed to attend then my attendance may very well be determined by whether or not the wedding falls on a day my kid is with me or his mother.", "YTA for using the word niblings.

Sister needs to grow up a touch and explain to your \"nibling\" that age limits are a pretty normal thing for weddings.  It isn't  personal, it's just a THING that happens.  But that would require her to stop asking you to give her family special treatment.  She absolutely can hire a babysitter, or have the older child babysit and pay her.  The kids won't implode without her for a single event/night.\n\nThat said, setting the rule at 18 is a little high.  Most childfree weddings I've seen are at the highest 16 and under.  But you do you.", "A 16 yo does not need a baby sitter and can easily watch her siblings for a few hours.

Why does the 16 yr old need a sitter?", "YTA.\n\nNot for having a child-free wedding.\n\nIt's the calling her \"lazy\". It sounds like she's mostly upset on her 16-year-old's behalf, from what you've said. So it sounds like she would make arrangements for the other kids if it came to that, but that her 16-year-old wants to come and doesn't understand why they're being treated as a \"kid\". Again, you're not obliged to invite the 16-year-old, but you can't just be throwing around accusations of lazy parenting because a mum is trying to be considerate of her almost-adult kid's feelings.", "Here\u2019s one.  Invite the 16 year old and not the mom.", "I've never heard that term 'nibling', you're NTAH here, she because she keeps asking.  Your niece is a bit over dramatic saying 'no one wants her'.  I have a daughter and even she laughed when she read that comment.    Enjoy your wedding, have tons of fun and dance your heart out!", "NTA\n\nI'd rescind her invitation. This isn't about not wanting \"the 16 year old\". It's not a snub. It's merely the fact your wedding is designed to cater to a specific group (for both enjoyment and affordability purposes) and anyone under 18 would not find it enjoyable. She made this a bigger issue by trying to cause peer pressure by going to the other family members.", "NTA. Am I crazy, or isn\u2019t one of them 16? Sis can hire 16 to babysit. Problem solved.", "YTA for two reasons:\n1.) 16 is not a kid. Are they an adult? No, but 16 can go to a wedding in my book. Especially your sister's kid.\n2.) You called her lazy. This insult doesn't make sense, and you should do better if you're gonna come after someone.", "Nta but wtf is a nibling \ud83d\ude02", "You'd be the AH in my family for not allowing an exception for a teenage niece/nephew who expressed interest in coming.\n\nYour 18+ limit is not a Federal Law. You can make exceptions.\n\nAgain, this sub seems to forget it's not \"Am I Within My Rights\" it's \"Am I The Asshole\".\n\nAnd yes, YTA to that 16yr old girl.", "I'm not sure she's lazy for not wanting to stay home with her kids, that just doesn't make sense but no NTA, it's your wedding and if your partner agrees no kids then no kids it is", "NTA I do feel bad for 16 though. It sounds like she's going through something.", "ESH. Your sister should accept that no means no, and you\u2019re justified in not wanting under-10s at your wedding. However, a 16 year old is more than old enough to attend a wedding without creating a disturbance, and excluding her for no reason when she clearly wants to come is a dick move. You\u2019re allowed manage your wedding as you please, but the 16 year old is justified in feeling snubbed, just like how any family member over 18 would be if they were excluded from a family wedding for no reason.", "Sister is definitely acting awful but I think this is more ESH. OP is lumping a 16 yr old with little kids. Childless weddings are usually 13 & up or 16 & up in my experience but if OP wants to go with 18, she should make an exception for someone she\u2019s a bit closer to since the niece is nearly an adult.\n\n\nIf I were niece, I wouldn\u2019t want to have anything to do with OP going forward since she\u2019s made it clear she doesn\u2019t see her as a person at all, but rather just \u2018one of her sister\u2019s kids\u2019.", "Ah, so not only not wanted at the wedding, the 16yr old also has to get drafted into babysitting her siblings.\n\nWhat an honor.", "Bride isn\u2019t an AH here\u2026how many times have we seen people claim here \u201cyour wedding, your rules\u201d when the commenter agreed with the decision.

There is exactly zero chance that the sister would be happy with just the 16YO being able to come.\n\nAnd if you say \u201cI\u2019ll let my 16YO niece come\u201d, you then have to answer questions like \u201cwhat about your 17YO cousin\u201d? \u201cWhat about this really well behaved 12 year old family friend?\u201d It will never stop. If it were really just about the 16 year old, the way to do it would be to put her in the wedding somehow.

That seems extreme to me. But then again, to each his own. \n\nThe 16yo sounds like she has greater issues she\u2019s struggling with though, so OP\u2019s sister should prob focus on that instead of this wedding\u2026", "Maybe because she\u2019s sick and tired of her mother pawning off her kids on the oldest.", "Same, my parents went to many weddings without us as kids.

As a parent, why the heck would I want to go to a wedding when my kids aren't included? If it is some kind of distant or exclusionary family relationship like that, I'd so much rather save the cost of the wedding gift and take my kids to the beach or mini-golfing, etc. than attend the wedding of some person who doesn't want the kids there. It is very weird this SIL is trying to negotiate with you over the wedding terms, and trying to somehow still come.
