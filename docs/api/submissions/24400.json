You\u2019re allowed to not invite people to your own wedding, but that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t consequences. You hurt your nieces feelings by leaving her out of a day she clearly wants to be a part of, and you seem to not even care. And none of this points to your sister being lazy, so what a weird comment to make. She\u2019s probably acting like this because she\u2019s the one that has to stand there and watch her daughter cry because you\u2019re leaving her out. Not saying what she did is right, but come tf on. \n\nYou can\u2019t be surprised when you exclude people that are old enough to understand they\u2019re being excluded and they get upset because of it.
