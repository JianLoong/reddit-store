We share so many things in common. So at the beginning of this semester, we were presented with the opportunity to be part of a research team in Harvard or MIT (depending on what were your interests). This was open for all students, he was accepted.\n\nThrough the rest of the semester he's been acting strange and distant academically speaking, I realized he relied so much on chat GPT, asked other people for their procedures, and kinda expecting everyone else on the team to do the work without him being part of any of it. There was even one time he criticized our work, eventhough we changed it, I realized he didn't contributed to the paper. For all this reasons I told him that I wouldn\u2019t be with him in the final project, I didn\u2019t tell him the reasons, just that I wanted to work with someone else because it had always been us. He agreed but I could sense he didn\u2019t take it well.\n\nAnyways, it\u2019s 2 days before the presentation and I\u2019m working on it, when Liam approaches. We had a small talk, and he asked about our progress, I didn\u2019t go into much detail, however he mentioned that his team was a behind and that all of them were pressured. I asked if I could help, but he told me that \u201ceverything was ok\u201d. It was strange for me but didn\u2019t give it so much thought.\n\nThe next day, I\u2019m with our professor asking for final feedback, we took longer than expected so he asked me if I didn\u2019t mind if I wait until the next session (Liam's) is over so he can give me the last comments. I had no problem, so I did, I sat in the back on the room. Liam starts showing his work and model, and it\u2019s strange for me to see that he has little to none missing details, everything is complete about it. Which surprises me since he mentioned they were behind.\n\nDay of the presentation, my team are part of the first groups to present, everything goes great and our professor congratulated us. Then it\u2019s Liam\u2019s team next on the Queue. His team did pretty well, however when they were presenting their design, it has a funny appearance. Minutes later a member of my team looks pretty upset, I asked him what was the matter, and he told me that Liam\u2019s team plagiarized a model from GrabCAD. I couldn\u2019t believe it until I saw it on my friend's computer. It was exactly the same, with just a few changes, but even those changes were ridiculous.\n\nOf course, we were all mad since all of us had worked months in our designs, and we had little to no patience to this kind of stuff. However, before we could tell our professor another team member stopped us. Telling that yeah, even though they\u2019re in the wrong, all of us were into much pressure just like them, and maybe he had no other choice, and that if we do this, it could jeopardize his chance on going to Harvard.\n\nI agree on that, but it\u2019s also not fair to let this go.\n\nWIBTA?", "created_utc": 1690831022, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15ep86n/wibta_if_a_report_a_friend_knowing_he_could_lose/", "score": 36, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If it's clearly obvious that their research was borrowed from someplace else and then changed slightly so that it's more in their language, you may wish to show support to your team member that you will go with them to the professor to investigate this matter. \n\nYour friend may also not be the one who fabricated it if he didn't do any of the work, so it would probably be best to present it to the professor that you believe plagiarism has taken place, and you can't say for sure how many of them in the group participated in it.", "NTA.  He's not going to be able to plagiarize his way through Harvard or MIT.  Might as well stop him now, he's going to be taking the space of someone who deserves the spot.", "YWNBTA. In fact, you would probably be going against university policy by *not* reporting it.", "NTA - Plagiarizing is a big no-no for a reason.  But what's even worse, is classes or school that grade on a curve.  Because grades are relative to the grades of others, their grade affects the grades of everyone else in the class.  So if they were to get a high grade, it would push down the grades below it.\n\nEDIT: Not to mention if he's plagiarizing, he's taking a spot from someone that didn't get into the university.", "NTA you need to point it out. He could be taking that opportunity from someone who actually worked for it.", "NTA, but you will be one if you don\u2019t report this.\n\nEvery year thousands if not more people around the world compete each year to get in Harvard. So every spot represents sacrifice and work. If your friend could get in, maybe they saw something on him, but for that same reason he should understand why plagiarism is a curse word. Even if he wasn\u2019t part of it, speaks volumes of him not participating the final project to even be aware of it. For all those reasons, he should not be going to Harvard. \n\nBesides the fact is an insult to YOUR teams work and everyone else\u2019s on that class, and not to mention the real author of that work.\nBy not reporting it you\u2019re being part of the problem, and don\u2019t get me wrong, I do understand your feelings, but HE did this to himself, not the other way around.", "Nta, fuck around and find out (academic cheating addition)", "YWNBTA but I will say this. Harvard professors aren\u2019t going to fall for it. Leaving him alone will only make sure he will fail out of University. \n\nThere\u2019s also a chance the others in the group did their work and Liam said he would do that section. This would cause the whole team to fail.", "NTA\n\nDon't just complain to the professor. Complain to the Dean of Faculty / Academic Standards Committee as well.\n\nDon't let people fail up.", "NTA- but if you get involved someone will figure out you complained and you will have to deal with the social consequences of that which might not bother you but it might. This is going to get me down voted a lott but I'm letting you know this because my cousin did a similar thing and she had to deal with those social consequences and it affected her social life in college.\n\nThink this over completely. You aren't obligated to tell on him, but you are NTA either way.", "NTA.  However what is your desired outcome here?  Will his grade affect yours at all?  Like lets say he gets an A and you get a B.  If you report him, you are still getting a B, but he is losing a lot.  \n\nHe was 100% in the wrong.  But also, you don't really know the specifics of the group and how this came to be.  \n\nI'd just look at whether whatever you'll feel after reporting him is worth the potential outcome of doing it.\n\nSo while I don't think you would be an asshole for doing it, I also wouldn't make that choice myself.", "It's a tough one. I'd say YWNBTA because they plagiarized, what they did goes against the rules for a reason: to make things fair for everyone.\n\nThey could blame you for taking that opportunity away from them but they did that to themselves.", "For anyone with any real experience with Harvard and MIT, this is thoroughly unbelievable.", "YWNBTA.\n\nPlagiarism is a serious academic offense, and it leads to a bunch of extremely problematic externalities that, unless addressed, causes further issues down the line.\n\nOn a basic level, it's an issue of fairness. On another level, it brings down his team; since he's plagiarized, it risks invalidating his whole team's project. It's up to the prof on what's going to happen, but if the prof decides that the team has to redo or rejig the project, that's a lot of work his team members have to take on because he wouldn't communicate the issues in his project.\n\nOn another, more long-term level, it can cause a lot of issues down the road. If Liam decides this is just a minor \"speed bump\" then he might pursue graduate studies or specialisation. Those can be very competitive, especially in terms of funding. If he does well here for plagiarizing, he might go off and get funding, meaning someone who *hasn't* plagiarized could lose out on a spot.  Even if he doesn't pursue grad school, him taking credit for someone else's work can lead to employers losing money or him potentially causing issues further down the road. Additionally, he needs to learn how to communicate in a team, if he has shortcomings or issues they need to solve it there and then, not bottle up and then cheat.", "INFO: If he were not going to graduate school, what would you do?", "NTA seriously, this isn't cool. He should be called out on it. He cheats now he will 100% cheat when he see how hard / stressful Harvard is. Would all the YTA be okay being treated by a doctor who cheated to pass and didn't really understand what they were doing? A lawyer who cheated and didn't really understand the law? A dentist who couldn't tell an incisor from a molar?\"", "Depends- if you have an honor code, you and the other student are required to report it, or you\u2019re culpable for knowing they cheated and did nothing. \n\nIf he\u2019s going to Harvard, they don\u2019t expel students for cheating and just sweep it under the rug. You only get kicked out if you commit a murder on campus, otherwise you take time off and just comeback, sometimes even a decade later. \n\nMIT would care, they are fairly tough on that and his research wouldn\u2019t be up to standard if he tried that their.", "If it was that obvious the professor knows. My take is this. If his getting in impacts you getting in then by all means say something. If it does not impact you say nothing.", "Copying other people's work and presenting it as your own? It worked for Gates and Zuckerberg, this guy will fit right in at a Harvard MBA program.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
