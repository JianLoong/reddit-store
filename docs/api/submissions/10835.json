She told me that apparently my son has been calling her daughter\u2019s traditional lunch weird and things as such and apparently that is making her daughter feel uncomfortable and insecure. She asked me to please talk to my son about being more sensitive and respectful so her daughter doesn\u2019t feel excluded.\n\nNow, I feel for this woman as a fellow mother. No one wants to see their child feeling sad, but overcoming insecurities is a big part of growing up. Additionally, I thought it was ridiculous of her to criticize my son, a 7 year old, for making relatively innocuous and curious comments about food that is not familiar to him. He\u2019s at a curious age and is discovering the world, and I refuse to try and limit him and shut him down for not having the emotional sensitivity of an adult.\n\nPolitely, I told that mother that I was sorry her daughter was struggling with insecurities, and I found some online parenting articles about building your child\u2019s confidence to send to her so she could use some tips to help her daughter out.\n\nShe replied and said I was acting completely shamelessly and disgracefully, and I am not able to text her anymore.

I'm 44 now and it can still be upsetting.", "Love this story.  Thanks.", "That part! \nWhat a teachable moment. \nAll I\u2019m thinking was what was this little girl eating cause I bet it was richly flavored, yummy cultural goodness.\nBut what 7 yr old even understands that \nAs a mom - what did she have, is their a restaurant nearby - family dinner night out - exposure and experience is the hallmark of a great childhood.", "My elder child had a thing like that in primary school (Australia) too.\n\nThis was in a particularly diverse area, though. We moved to a more rural area now, not sure if it's done at new school for when younger child starts going.\n\nThe only thing I will say is, you may need to put some restrictions on it like please don't put peanuts in etc.", "I really don't think OP's understood what happened there. Is the other mother going to leave it at that? No. All communication is going to go through the school now and there's going to be a file", "\"This is America. How 'bout you pack your kid a good ol' American ham sandwich instead of that weird yakisoba stuff, okay? Here are some articles on how to accommodate my child so he doesn't have to be bothered by learning your culture exists...\"", "There\u2019s no way in hell this person actually read those articles, either.", "I feel bad for the bullied kid, she\u2019s just trying to eat her lunch and this kid is making fun of her culture.", "I bet the other mum was so mad too. If nothing else, now it's *definitely* a fight. OP can't even defuse conflicts as an adult", "Great point. Indicating in some reasonable way that you find the behaviour unacceptable is one of the trickiest bits of being an adult. My kids do a lot of martial arts training.

This notion of basic parenting being a punishment.", "Mhm, as soon as I read OP's post, I was like, YTA. \n\nI remember when I was a kid, a literal teacher called my food 'revoulting.' That shattered me as a child, and it was something that my mum would pack for my lunch occasionally, so when I had it, I would make sure there was no one else around. People need to do a better job at educating and raising their kids.", "Not deluded in the least, just an asshole.", "That's the rule in our house, and my 4 and 5 year olds get it. They even use it on us when we slip, and we thank them for correcting us.

Clearly it didn\u2019t happen one time either if the mom felt she had to call the kids parent?  Not checking this behavior now is just enforcing him becoming a more effective bully.", "And now in addition to acting in a manner as to not provoke anger, not dressing in a manner to provoke harassment or assault, now we need to not eat things that will provoke insults.", "I remember once in junior high, I brought leftover Chinese food, and some kids said it was \u201cgross\u201d and that the Shanghai noodles looked like worms. I told them they were missing out but it made me a bit insecure and I\u2019m not Chinese. I can\u2019t imagine how it would feel for a young child eating food from her culture. There is no \u201cweird food\u201d just food you have never had before.", "Exactly. She should have taken him to every requirement in town that isn't local cuisine over the next year to broaden his cultural awareness. Were in the SE USA and my kids love sushi, Ethiopian, and Thai and Indian is routine.

No 5th grader should know that word.\n\nI got the parents info from the school and requested to see a counselor with the parents and kids involved. The parents just screamed; I smiled and sat silent.

She needs to form thicker skin and no better way to do that than by  OP allowing her child to continue bullying the other child.\n\nETA: /s, even though I didn\u2019t think it was needed.

And mean while op\u2019s raising a little asshole", "This is what did it for me...she took extra steps to insult this woman when her child is the problem. Im curious as to what the food is thats so weird in the 1st place. Probably feeds her child garbage while the other kids eating healthy/good food.", "Mumsplained! lol, i like it. Tho for some reason I feel it should be mommysplained cuz of \"mommy dearest\" movie", "Saving this", "I'm betting the same.\n\nAnd you can't justify a comment about something being weird by labeling it as curiosity. Curiosity is \"whoa, weird, what is that? Is it good?\" Bullying is \"blech, gross,  you *eat* that? But it's squishy! Weird. You're weird cause your food is weird.\"\n\nGiven the fact the girl felt embarrassed and not like she was asked to share her culture, I'm leaning towards the son being less curious and more of a jerk.", "Bullies beget bullies.", "The apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree", "Yep. OP is raising a bully and is proud of it. OP, YTA.", "Well, in theory. The problem is that the parents that teach the 1st lesson teach the 2nd lesson as well usually. But parents who have precious angels teach neither. So you end up with children who are well-behaved and who aren't assertive on one hand and spoilt children on the other hand. \n\nObviously, personality comes into play, but before 2020 I taught my son to not take toys from others when we were at baby groups and to share the common toys (read: not get upset if someone takes a toy off him). Now, getting back into normality, I had to teach him that it's okay to say no, to shout and hit as self-defense (he got attacked by some children at a soft play when he was out of my sight and said and did nothing until they were finished hitting him), and to stand up for himself with children and with grown-ups (wasn't allowed to use the toilet at lunch because he was distracted and hadn't eaten much, so he had an accident; I  nearly ripped some heads off)", "This thread is now locked due to an excess of rule violations. \r\n\r\n[Sub Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/) ||| [\"FAQs\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)", "And she has the nerve to post this and not even reply to people.

I'm Ukrainian and my garlicky food was \"weird\" - I starved through the day and threw my lunch out in secret. My partner is Korean and went through the same BS as a kid. How thick do you need to be to deflect that it's \"healthy curiosity\" and \"the other kid's problem\"", "Something similar happened to me when I was little. A boy from my class said the lunch my mom sent me was gross. I was extremely shy and awkward, and that comment made me stop wanting to take lunches to school. \n\nMy mom got in contact with his mom and explained the situation, and just asked if she could talk to him so he could understand how his comment impacted me, and could impact others. His mom not only talked to him, but also asked my mom if she could send two of the same lunch the next day. He sat with me, apologized for saying my food was gross, and ate it with me! \n\nThe way his mom chose to go about teaching him really stuck with me, even now over 20 years later.
