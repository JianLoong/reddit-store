She asked me to please talk to my son about being more sensitive and respectful so her daughter doesn\u2019t feel excluded.\n\nNow, I feel for this woman as a fellow mother. No one wants to see their child feeling sad, but overcoming insecurities is a big part of growing up. Additionally, I thought it was ridiculous of her to criticize my son, a 7 year old, for making relatively innocuous and curious comments about food that is not familiar to him. He\u2019s at a curious age and is discovering the world, and I refuse to try and limit him and shut him down for not having the emotional sensitivity of an adult.\n\nPolitely, I told that mother that I was sorry her daughter was struggling with insecurities, and I found some online parenting articles about building your child\u2019s confidence to send to her so she could use some tips to help her daughter out.\n\nShe replied and said I was acting completely shamelessly and disgracefully, and I am not able to text her anymore.
