I was trying to do a good thing. No good dead\u2026 right? I\u2019m in management. I transferred departments a couple months back. I like my new team, we\u2019re very diverse, which is refreshing. Immediately though, I was concerned over one individual who I will call Noam. He\u2019s been an employee here for over a decade, yet he\u2019s the odd one out. \n\nWe give our team members options to work from home. Noam takes full advantage of this policy when there is not a mandatory in-person meeting. His work is always complete, so it\u2019s is fine, but I can sense he\u2019s reluctant to participate in our workplace culture. It was my little project to get him more involved. This proved difficult. When I asked simple questions, *what\u2019s your wife do, how long have you lived here*, etc., he would get cagey. I tried encouraging him to get food with us, etc. My grandparents are immigrants and I saw how they often felt othered especially about food, so I like try try all sorts of restaurants with the team. We got catering from a team members family owned ethnic restaurant, yet Noam didn\u2019t eat anything. This was hurtful. We\u2019re having a potluck this week, we all signed up to bring dishes of significance to us, yet he doesn\u2019t want to bring anything. \n\nOver time I\u2019ve put together he may have religious food restrictions. I decided to get team lunch from a locally owned Israeli kosher deli. Maybe something more familiar to him and his home country would be appealing, and since it\u2019s kosher he can eat it. Well, he refused even that. He hadn\u2019t responded to my email, I had even printed a menu for him and left it on his desk in the morning because I\u2019m pretty sure he doesn\u2019t open the survey. By the end of the day I stopped by his desk and he had the menu still sitting there so I started a conversation about it, I tried reading off some things to ask him about some of the food, asking what kinds of things does he like, etc. He seemed to shut down during the interaction and by the end said he will bring food from home like always.\n\nLast week I pulled him into my office and we had a talk about his team spirit. I worry it can be hard for some people to take me seriously in management, so I was asking him to work with me, you know? Today, Monday, he comes in and asked to speak. He said it was nice of me to find a Jewish restaurant but he likes to bring his own food, he said he has an autoimmune condition and has to be careful with food. That was simple, he couldn\u2019t have said so earlier! But he continued to say he felt singled out when I read the menu to him in the office. He\u2019s a smart guy, he found a way to turn it around on me, to make me the asshole over being inclusive. He\u2019s so good at it I\u2019m questioning my sanity. I thought you all here could have a laugh with me at the absurdity. What\u2019s the verdict, who\u2019s the real asshole here?", "created_utc": 1674511321, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jow75/aita_for_trying_to_be_more_inclusive_of_a/", "score": 325, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm generally not that interested in being \"sociable\" with the people I work with and enforced social events eg the obligatory Christmas lunch and after-work socials drive me up the wall for a variety of reasons.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I was trying to do a good thing. No good dead\u2026 right? I\u2019m in management. I transferred departments a couple months back. I like my new team, we\u2019re very diverse, which is refreshing. Immediately though, I was concerned over one individual who I will call Noam. He\u2019s been an employee here for over a decade, yet he\u2019s the odd one out. \n\nWe give our team members options to work from home. Noam takes full advantage of this policy when there is not a mandatory in-person meeting. His work is always complete, so it\u2019s is fine, but I can sense he\u2019s reluctant to participate in our workplace culture. It was my little project to get him more involved. This proved difficult. When I asked simple questions, *what\u2019s your wife do, how long have you lived here*, etc., he would get cagey. I tried encouraging him to get food with us, etc. My grandparents are immigrants and I saw how they often felt othered especially about food, so I like try try all sorts of restaurants with the team. We got catering from a team members family owned ethnic restaurant, yet Noam didn\u2019t eat anything. This was hurtful. We\u2019re having a potluck this week, we all signed up to bring dishes of significance to us, yet he doesn\u2019t want to bring anything. \n\nOver time I\u2019ve put together he may have religious food restrictions. I decided to get team lunch from a locally owned Israeli kosher deli. Maybe something more familiar to him and his home country would be appealing, and since it\u2019s kosher he can eat it. Well, he refused even that. He hadn\u2019t responded to my email, I had even printed a menu for him and left it on his desk in the morning because I\u2019m pretty sure he doesn\u2019t open the survey. By the end of the day I stopped by his desk and he had the menu still sitting there so I started a conversation about it, I tried reading off some things to ask him about some of the food, asking what kinds of things does he like, etc. He seemed to shut down during the interaction and by the end said he will bring food from home like always.\n\nLast week I pulled him into my office and we had a talk about his team spirit. I worry it can be hard for some people to take me seriously in management, so I was asking him to work with me, you know? Today, Monday, he comes in and asked to speak. He said it was nice of me to find a Jewish restaurant but he likes to bring his own food, he said he has an autoimmune condition and has to be careful with food. That was simple, he couldn\u2019t have said so earlier! But he continued to say he felt singled out when I read the menu to him in the office. He\u2019s a smart guy, he found a way to turn it around on me, to make me the asshole over being inclusive. He\u2019s so good at it I\u2019m questioning my sanity. I thought you all here could have a laugh with me at the absurdity. What\u2019s the verdict, who\u2019s the real asshole here?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He\u2019s doing his job fine so leave him tf alone jeez", "YTA.

Why in the world are you taking this so personally? Quit wasting your energy on what your people eat and focus on what they do.", "YTA. I can see that you were TRYING to be inclusive and thoughtful, but you ended up just being overly pushy. Yes, it was nice of you to try and find a restaurant he might want to go to, but it should have ended at his no.", "YTA. I think it's great that you tried to involve him, but when he wasn't receptive, you shouldn't have insisted, taken it personally, or acted like he's maliciously trying to make you feel crazy. For some people, a job is just a job, not an opportunity to socialize. Since he's been with the company for a while, I assume he's good at his job and his lack of social engagement hasn't been a big problem in the past. If you really want to be inclusive, try listening, being approachable, and assuming the best about people, instead of letting your insecurities dictate your actions.\n\nAlso, I'd personally be rather uncomfortable if somebody at work researched my cultural/religious background and proposed to order food for the team associated with that, then interviewed me in front of colleagues about what foods I like from it. I have a pretty complicated relationship with the culture, religion, and cuisine.", "NAH if this project was passed along to you and as long as you learn from this.\n\nContrary to some of what appears in the antiwork sub... being in management is not a walk in the part. Sometimes part of the corp goals includes this \"employee engagement\" stuff. I think the problem is that you kind of went a little too far ultimately. If you look at the facts, did he get his job done? Yes. Was he an HR nightmare? Doesn't seem to be. In some ways, he behaved like a very low maintenance worker... almost the kind people seem to think companies actually want and get angry for thinking so. For example... Noam does his work.. would be perfectly happy to never have the company spend any money on a party or any kind of social events. It is good to pressure test this a bit, but you don't need to treat him like a child. \n\nSometimes, there are people who really do just want to do the work... and don't have anything deeper going on. It is kind of rare actually, but seems like he is one. If he were impossible for folks to work with or treated people badly... that would be one thing... but the company culture stuff can get a bit too much and isn't something we can always expect everyone to want in their life.", "I get where you were coming from, and honestly it was nice of you to put in a bit of extra effort to make sure he was included.\n\nBut, turns out he doesn't want to be included.\n\nInstead of accepting that, you kept going.

All I'm getting from this is you repeatedly made assumptions about Noam in an attempt to get him involved, never actually bothered to ask him why he doesn't get involved, and now you're mad that he told you the exact reason.
