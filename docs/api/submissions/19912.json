Not something a person is entitled to.", "NTA - I\u2019m so sorry you and your siblings are forced to live in such a toxic environment. My advice to you is to focus on school, get a job and save like crazy so you can escape that place as soon as you can.", "NTA he isn't your father or father figure so he doesn't get a gift. Your mom is very young and maybe she is desperate for the security or stability he offers and yanks back as a way to control her. \n\nI commend you for seeing red flags and not ignoring them.", "NTA. Just because he apologized doesn't mean that you're required to forgive him and especially not required to forget. You are correct that he's your mother's bf and not your father. Thus, a father's day card/gift would not be appropriate. Your mother may want you to consider him your father, but that's a completely unreasonable ask. That will never happen.\r  \n\r  \nAs far as the birthday goes, that's trickier. I get that you don't want to give him a gift, and I think you're justified in not doing so. The factor you also have to think about is that you're still a dependent, and you need to live there for years. On a practical basis, what backlash can you expect?", "NTA the gifts are called love bombing.  His only use to you will be money. Never count on him for emotional support.", "NTA for sure, but I'd still get him a gift.\n\nJUST TO BE CLEAR, not money or anything he'd actually like or really get use out of. Get him a candle from walgreens or some shit. A gift that he knows has the most little effort put into it as humanly possible while not being offensive.\n\nYour mother is in a very shitty position, and should very obviously not be with this jackass. But at the same time, you're not really in a position to do a whole lot about it except give her support whenever possible. So do that.\n\nKeep supporting your mom and siblings, and celebrate with her when she finally leaves that relationship. I really hope things improve for you.", "NTA. But I would ask mom to buy the gift and you give it. It can help to keep things calm in the family. Why fight ?

It might be dangerous to upset him, he has shown he is untrustworthy, and you depend on him. I'd get him a gift, not for him, but as payment for your families safety. Something mediocre just above the petty line will suffice. Perhaps take one of his bribes and use it for the gifts. Or hell, take all of them, and put it in a get-out-of-here fund.", "NTA. 50 and 32?! Wow. (Not like i can talk, my grandparents were 20 years apart)\n\nHe\u2019s not your father, nor does he seem like a hood father figure. Therefore he doesn\u2019t need a father\u2019s day gift. You are not obligated to give him a gift for anything. \n\nI can get that people say things in the heat of an argument, but bringing you kids into it was something different.

There's nothing unintentional about that.\n\nHe's now sending her money she doesn't want, which very much feels like love bombing. Just of the children rather than the partner.\n\nI agree harbouring hate is not healthy, and if OP is able to rise above that it will do them good long term.

This sort of dysfunction can be generational. Break the cycle, and keep in touch with your siblings so you can help them when they become adults. This family life is not normal, or at the very least, not healthy. I'm sure you love your mom, and no 15/16 year old can rationally consent to a 26/27 year old (believe me, you may not think so now but it's like a light switch flips in your brain when you become old enough and, all of a sudden, you just get it). But she hasn't made a stable home for you and your siblings, and you need to prioritize your own well-being. I'm sorry you're going through this.", "Your mother needs to get your sister in to see a medical professional immediately.
