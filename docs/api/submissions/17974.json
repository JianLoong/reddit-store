You can feel whatever you do - there\u2019s nothing wrong with what you feel. But this isn\u2019t your decision. I don\u2019t understand the argument that she has done something wrong by choosing her own support team during a medical event that she will go through. \n\nYou say you\u2019re very private - but you aren\u2019t going to be in labour and you aren\u2019t going to give birth. Many women choose to have friends or family support them when they give birth separate to their husband. It\u2019s a different kind of support. \n\nIt\u2019s fine to say - I wish I was part of the discussion - but it\u2019s also fine for her to choose her own support and tell you her decisions. A discussion implies that she would be open to changing her decision based on your opinion. \n\nThis may or may not be anything about you. Maybe she just wanted her friend there. Maybe you haven\u2019t always been supportive of her during previous labours (not deliberately necessarily - but some husbands undermine their wife\u2019s decisions during labour - and argue against their wishes - possibly out of fear and ignorance) and she wanted an advocate who put her wants first. Maybe it is something bigger - and maybe not.", "NTA, but your wife isn't wrong. It's her body. It's her medical procedure. The decision on who should be there belongs to your wife.", "NTA.\n\nThis is definitely something that a couple should discuss before someone else is invited into the room. Whether you have the right of veto or not is perhaps debatable. but your wife showed a lack of respect for you by not even having a conversation with you about it first.", "NTA\n\nYes mum gets final say when it comes to people to be with her during birth. You seem to understand this so nothing wrong on your side. \n\nMum is an AH for springing this on you so abruptly. This sub loves to emphasise the importance of communication in relationships and I think your wife should have done better. \n\nShe didn't need to ask permission or anything but just a simple \"Hey I was thinking about asking Sarah to be with us for the delivery. Do you have any problems with that? No? Great I'll let her know then.\"", "NTA\n\nI would be offended simply because it wasn't discussed before the offer was made. \"I would like to ask Sarah to attend, do you think she would?\". Not asking permission, but giving an alert.

You can't control how you feel about it, and it's you shouldn't have to hide your initial emotional reaction to it, as long as you bring up your concerns in a respectful and productive way. I think your wife should have said something about this ahead of time in a less offhand way. It sounds like this person wasn't at the birth of your first two children? So you wouldn't have expected her to be there for this birth either, right?\n\nYour wife deserves to have people she loves in the delivery room, but it's your child, too. And you absolutely deserve to be included in this decision. I would talk to her about this again. Let her know that you were surprised and a bit hurt not to be included in her decision. Ultimately, I think she gets to decide who is there since she is the one giving birth, but your feelings deserve consideration as well.", "If my wife asked for a Mariachi band to be there I'd have supported her.

You can't be the AH for your feelings, it's how you handle those feelings that matters. At some point (preferably without pregnancy hormones in play) you might want to discuss with your wife how this initially made you feel, and that communicating with each other before on others on personal matters is important to you. \n\nI don't think she's the AH here either though. She likely got caught up in the excitement of having her best friend with her and just didn't think it all the way through, but her communication was definitely lacking. It sounds like you have a strong foundation together though, and will be able to work through this with no problem. \n\nAlso, congratulations on your little one!", "It\u2019s a little strange that you would be \u201coffended\u201d ... by what? You need to talk to your wife. Ask your wife to share her vision for that day. Maybe it will help you better understand her perspective. If you\u2019re just pissed off because she didn\u2019t \u201cask\u201d you first... that\u2019s a different issue. Pick your problem cautiously. \n\nI\u2019m not trying to make you feel badly (you have 2 kids so you understand) but if we are just looking at facts.... Neither you or Sarah are needed, if something happened during delivery, there would be no privacy & the best of plans often fall apart when baby finally decides to arrive. So it\u2019s best not to be too upset or offended if plans change during delivery because you have no control of the event. \n\nYour only job is to support your wife & child on delivery day. Your feelings are just not the most important part of this equation. However, if you feel very strongly that Sarah should not be included, you need to have that conversation.\n\nNAH \u2014 talk to your wife.

This is not a situation for you. It doesn\u2019t matter how private you want personal and close things. Your wife will be the one on display. And this is her BEST friend. Her friend since they were little children. So it makes sense that she would want her with her. Honestly I\u2019d chalk up not telling you to pregnancy brain. Did you even ask her why she didn\u2019t talk to you about it?", "ESH, but only a bit. Yes, it's not a big ask to want to be a part of that decision. However, I honestly don't see an easy course of action from here on out if you don't adapt or at least make some compromises. She is the one giving birth, she wants her friend there, you're not happy with that. Something has to give, and you are in the best situation to make the compromise. \n\nHowever, you should probably (very gently) discuss it with her. Maybe ask to be included in future decisions and have an open conversation about what moments you'd like to keep more private? I have no idea what might be feasible, but you guys can figure it out. \n\nGood luck OP, and congratulations on the baby!", "YTA\n\nShe is doing hard work and needs whatever is going to make her feel relaxed and calm", "NTA\n\n  \n\n\nHaving been at the birth of both my children it's a very personal moment, she should have atleast discussed it with you.\n\n  \n\n\nIf you plan of having a 4th invite your mate Dave over to the conception without telling her", "YTA.

Get over yourself and be glad your wife has a good support system.", "ESH. \n\nShe should have discussed this with you prior to asking, however, she is the one carrying baby and pushing baby out. If she feels like having her bff there will benefit her, you shouldn\u2019t have an issue with it. She needs a solid support system during that time and you need to support her on that. \n\nUnless you will not be allowed in the room and bff will be the only one with her. Then, maybe my opinion will change.", "NAH. I understand you feeling a bit strange about it, but at the end of the day she's giving birth, you're not. She gets whatever she wants!", "NTA as being the dad you have a say in this situation and Sarah or whoever cannot be just reeled in because the wife wants someone else in the hospital. Seriously it sounds a bit odd.", "NTA- you're entitled to FEEL any way you want, and especially because you have very wisely decided to keep those feelings to yourself. You recognize that ultimately the person with the uterus has the final say, and that's great. You may be just a little shocked that just you isn't enough for her (like it was before!), but it can only be a good thing to have another person who loves her in the room, cheering her on (or whatever). It may also be helpful for her to have someone in the room that actually knows what it is like. I'm sorry you are uncomfortable, but this is one of the only times in your marriage that it is, truly, all about her.", "YTA\u2026 This isn\u2019t about you.

Talk to her", "NAH you fine in your feelings but it's ultimately her giving birth and her choice who she has there", "NTA\n\nInitially I was going to go with N A H but changed my mind with your updates.\n\nYou are right in that some communication would've been good to have before a decision like this was made unilaterally.\n\nYou've had very positive experiences in the past and from your updates I'm not sure Sarah is adding any more to your wife's support other than watching her give birth.  And Sarah's got two kids of her own so it's not like she hasn't any idea of the birthing process (unless hers were elective operative births for whatever reason).\n\nThere's a part of me that wonders whether your wife forgot to talk to you about this simply because she is a midwife.  For her another person in the room is just there.  This is what she does for a living and there are often students and others in the room.  And there is less of an emotional reason to have Sarah there for her because there's a sense of desensitisation of the birth suites because your wife works in them.  Especially if she's been a midwife for a while.  Does Sarah by any chance is considering becoming a midwife or a doula and wants to observe someone giving birth?\n\nYour wife may be one of the women that goes into herself while birthing and isn't fussed by who is there.  All she's focusing on at the time is breathing through and blocking everything else out.  But you on the other hand is acutely aware of all the other people in the room.\n\nIt is her body and her choice but you need to have a chat with her and find out why she really wants Sarah in the room.  You may have missed something that she needed... or she just simply forgot to include you (that desensitisation thing of her workplace).  But just phrase it in a non confrontational way and say you were surprised to hear that she wanted Sarah there and is there something you have missed?\n\nI doubt this happened, but just make sure your wife wasn't railroaded into letting Sarah be there.  Maybe a comment that went too far and your wife doesn't want to upset her.  There is also the sisterhood of birth that some people want that female connection during labour of people that have gone through it (and your wife wants her friend rather than her workmate).  \n\nI remember my SIL asking if she could be at my first birth and I was so blindsided that I didn't know what to say so I said it was fine.  And my husband is a bit of a people pleaser and his sister has always just done what she wanted and told people what was going to happen rather than asked them if it was okay.  I really didn't want her there but couldn't say anything.  I didn't really bring it up again... we also didn't call her when I went into labour.. and I actually think my husband didn't really want her there either as it was a me and him thing and his SIL wasn't there when the kid was created.... so the topic of ringing her didn't come up and I may have said to him during a contraction that I didn't want to call her or made some excuse for no one to ring her.", "Nah you can be uncomfortable, even unhappy, with her choice. But at the end of the day, it's *her* very invasive and painful medical procedure so she gets final say.\n\nSo as long as you don't act on your feelings, you're fine.", "INFO: would you also have a problem if she asks her mom to be at birth?", "YTA This is your 3rd child.

Why does she need your opinion? \nShe made a decision on what she wants, and she told you. Would you be offended if she wanted her Mother there?

But neither are needed in the delivery room itself. But the rest of your comment still stands.", "Of course this is a situation for the father and husband. \n\nAnd I am her husband and father of two other children. \n\nAnd nobody is stopping that, if I told her no sorry I really don't want that, she would respect that as her partner and father of her children without even a second of thought , but I wouldn't do that anyway, it's not about that, it's about the communication.", "No no I'm ok if she really wants her there, than she gets her there of course,   but still odd and feel offended by not having at least talking to me about it before hand.\n\nIt's our 3rd and probably last,  .... but that's what we said with the 2nd one too so who know.", "Bahahahahah.", "I don't agree with this. Other people (especially the husband and father of the child) don't just get thrown out the window when someone gets pregnant. Of course, mom's needs are important.

You know before the birth is happening, the friend isn't just showing up day-of.\n\nShe didn't give you a chance to change her mind, but she told you what was going to happen it sounds like as soon as her friend accepted. If her friend hadn't wanted to be there, likely you wouldn't have been told, because it wasn't a thing that would be happening.\n\nThese are two different things: Communicating what will happen before it happens so you know what the plan is on the day, and can be prepared for it, or \"discussing\" before hand and giving you a chance to voice objections and getting your permission and sign-off on her decisions.\n\nPlease don't conflate the two. She communicated.\n\nWhile it's valid to wish you had more control over something important to you (even if logically, you understand why you can't have that control), it's also important to acknowledge that's what your actual issue here is. You wanted to be a part of the decision-making process, you wanted to be able to try to sway her and make arguments for your way, you do not like that she made a decision on her own without you about this.\n\nShe might have done it that way *specifically because* she didn't want to participate in an argument about it.

If mum wants dad thrown out the room during the labour because he is causing her undue stress or something, that will absolutely happen. If it was the husband going through a different medical procedure, and he told his wife I want my best friend or dad or whoever there, when I go in and wake up, everyone would be calling her asshole if she had any opinion on that. Labour can never be a moment when father's opinions/needs have the same value as the mother giving birth. If she suddenly decides she wants an epidural, father can't go 'oh i thought we were trying for all natural' he would be a massive asshole. Birth plans are solely for the comfort and safety of the person giving birth. Our second child my husband even asked if i would rather have my mum there, because of covid i could only have 1 person, i said no but all he cared about was my comfort. He went to pieces the first time round while my my mum was a rock, he was great second time though. Below OP says she is only 4 months, she never needed to ask him permission to have another support person but she is giving him plenty of time to get used to the idea.", "Yeah this is what should have happened.", "You keep saying you're aware, but what is the alternate that you're imagining? That you were asked first, ie asked your opinion, in case you were opposed and you could therefore have the option of convicing her otherwise because of your preferences?", "This WAS her telling you. Springing it on you would be you showing up at the hospital and being like \"Hey, hun? What's Tracy doing here already?\"", "As I just told OP, this WAS her telling him. How was this her springing it on him? Am I reading this wrong and this conversation took place when her water broke or something?", "so he can what agree for no reason, or disagree and they have an argument about it", "he says he\u2019s not sure if he\u2019s comfortable with anyone else being there. So he\u2019s not \u201cliterally.. fine with Sarah joining them\u201d at all.", "Thing is, this doesn\u2019t involve both of them. The wife is the patient. \n\nI understand OP\u2019s feelings, but the reality is he has no say in this. If she decides she doesn\u2019t want him there he won\u2019t be there.", "So wait, she's still having you there, not excluding you for Sarah?", "Yep which is why I can understand you feeling a bit odd about it! But this seems like a minor blip in communication rather than a huge issue, no?", "I wouldn't really think that's offensive imho. If I was pregnant I would simply defer to, \"well, I'm the pregnant one.\" Maybe she could have said something sooner but I have little understanding of why this is such a big deal to you. Your wife wants support. Let her be supported! More support is always better, especially during such a stressful event, right?", "No not at all, both very close, very happy births.", "But if you care about your partner you usually talk to them before you make big decisions, like whether or not the birth of your child is going to be a private moment between the two of you or not. I'd be hurt that they didn't even feel like telling me before they told Sarah. That's generally not something you want to find out by overhearing her conversation with someone else.", "Being able to do what you want does not suddenly make it where others can\u2019t have an opinion or feel some type of way about it.", "Yes, but if you care about your partner you usually talk to them before you make big decisions, like whether or not the birth of your child is going to be a private moment between the two of you or not. I'd be hurt that they didn't even feel like telling me before they told Sarah. That's generally not something you want to find out by *overhearing her conversation with someone else*", "She has two of her own.", "Its communication. OP accepts that she gets final say but since this is a relationship and also OP's child he should have at least had some prior communication regarding it.\n\nFunny how the same sub that uses \"communication\" as the stick to beat bfs/husbands over the head is now completely ignoring it.", "No , not at all. But I'm still the father of this baby, still the husband,  I wouldn't be opposed to it at all,  just think as a partner,  in a big event,  shouldn't have been blind sided I think?", "\u201cHey I\u2019m planning on asking\u201d rather than \u201cSo I invited someone to watch me give birth.\u201d OP wanted communication that it was going to happen, not to be told after the fact.", "Op was the last one to know, which is absolutely abysmal communication since he should have been the first one wife discussed it with. \n\nNTA.", "No this was her telling OP after she asked Sarah. This is something that she should have discussed with OP before asking Sarah which is why OP rightfully feels blindsided. \n\nHe isn't opposed to the idea, just the fact that he feels like an afterthought.", "She told OP after telling Sarah\n\n  \n\n\nThat's awful communication", "Its part of a relationship. Healthy communication.", "Healthy communication involves discussing issues that may be emotionally charged so that everyone can understand each other, even if you don't agree. For that to work, both parties have to be able to talk and listen respectfully. \n\nIt's his wife's decision regarding who is in the room. It would've been nice to have a conversation about it, especially if she knew he might have feelings about this change. But it hinges on whether they were both capable of having a proper and respectful conversation.", "No argument,  if that's what she wants that's fine, if i say that's not really what I want, that would be fine with her too.", "I don't have to be comfortable personally having someone there with us, don't mean I will try to block it or say no you can't.  personally i am not comfortable with such an emotional situation, being shared, but sometimes we do things that are outside our comfort zone for people we care about,   I can accept that, but also husbands need and want to be part of the births, and decision's BEFORE the the birth itself too no?", ">No no I'm ok if she really wants her there, than she gets her there of course,   but still odd and feel offended by not having at least talking to me about it before hand.\n\nFrom the OP\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Blocked for pointing out the truth. Just another day on AITA", "This does involve them both because its OP's child as well and they aren't roommates, the are a couple. \n\nYes the wife gets final say in who gets to be there, but part of being a couple is keeping your partner informed (not telling them after) before you make decisions. Its part of relationship communication.", "Than I\u2019m going to say No not the A. I think your wife could have communicated it better. I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with her wanting an extra support person. I think my vote would NAH.", "I think it\u2019s a reach.... this is all about my wife but I don\u2019t like the way she is planning the plan?\n\nI don\u2019t get it. If I told my husband I invited a marching band in to the delivery room, we wouldn\u2019t be debating that. Just giving him a heads up. My husband was part of all of our children being born, he didn\u2019t get a say on what the day would look or feel like. He has been included in every other decision in our children\u2019s lives but those days were not about him. Just me & our child. Whatever moment he had was his moment. I had more important things to do. I wasn\u2019t worrying about my husband\u2019s experience.", "It appears your wife would like Sarah to support her during this delivery. She has a reason to include her. What\u2019s the reason?", "Testify!", "But how were you blind sided? It's not like you found out on the day, which would be a problem. She decided, asked her then told you about it shortly afterwards.", "Agree.", "It\u2019s his child but it\u2019s her medical procedure. It\u2019s not \u2018she has the final say\u2019 it\u2019s \u2018he has no say.\u2019 If she doesn\u2019t want him there he won\u2019t be there either. That\u2019s the way it is.\n\nAs I said, I understand OP\u2019s feelings on this but, ultimately, he needs to let them go.", "I never said he gets a say, I said a heads up would have been decent.", "They are friends since grade one.\nShe said to her that since this is the last one we will have, would be nice to share that with her, besides that no reason whatsoever.  Both previous births were very great, personal and loving moment's for us both.", "I don't believe that's how a relationship works though  .\nAgain, and I should have said this in the post, if that's what she wants, that's fine.", "Why are you so focused on shitting on him by saying \"he has no say\"\n\nHe knows this. He accepts this and just wanted to be informed of this before she asked Sarah. He just wanted healthy communication from his wife and people like you are trying to make him sound unreasonable for wanting that.", "You\u2019re on a slippery slope here. The only thing that matters is the health & safety of your wife & child. Who cares what the plan is. If your wife & baby are fine, you just had a really friggin wonderful day! \n\nWe have 4 (3 pregnancies) the last birth of twins. I delivered in an OR with 2 teams of doctors gowned & masked because who knows with twins. I had no clue which person was my husband ... he was also gowned & masked. It\u2019s was chaos. None of it mattered. Only those babies mattered. \n\nEvery delivery is different. You can have a private moment with your wife if Sarah is there. Having more people in the room shouldn\u2019t matter. The goal doesn\u2019t change by who is in the room.", "How much time until the baby is born? It sounds like she is preparing now", "I\u2019m not shitting on anyone. That\u2019s literally the law. \n\nFor the third time, I understand why he feels like he does. But it\u2019s not his decision, she made the decision and she told him in plenty of time. This is one to let go.", "It's not who ends up in the room end of the day... it's making a pretty emotional private decision, without any discussion or communication", "She's 4  months now.", "It's not just a decision thing, if i told her no I'm really not comfortable with this, I know she will say, \" ok that's fine we won't have her there , not a problem. \".  But I wouldn't do that to begin with,", "There\u2019s literally nothing private or emotional about \u201cplanning\u201d for a delivery. You seem to have your own vision & believe you have some control your wife\u2019s delivery. Maybe it\u2019s just a privacy thing. \n\nI think you\u2019re reaching on this one to prove your wife has somehow hurt your feelings because she didn\u2019t consult you. If that\u2019s how you feel you should speak to your wife. You can talk about it until your blue in the face & then the whole plan could fall apart anyway. There\u2019s nothing to be upset about here since nothing has happened. \n\nIf my husband ever tried to plan how my delivering our child was going to be for his benefit.... My response would be \u201cwhen you deliver a child you can plan it anyway you want but until then you\u2019re just an invited guest at my party. That invite can be rescinded\u201d.\n\nedit spelling", "Thats heaps of time, dude.", "So you have 5 months notice? How is that being sprung on you?", "So what\u2019s the problem? You\u2019re ok with the friend being there, you know she\u2019d ask her not to be if you weren\u2019t and you\u2019re annoyed with her for not talking to you and you\u2019re not talking to her about it. \n\nJust let it go, pal.", "You sound like a very considerate person.", "I'm not ok with it,  in the sense that I'm not comfortable with it,  but obviously I'm ok with it if thats what she really wants, healthy couples DONT need to agree with everything you know...."]}
