Call me the Pig with the Brickhouse. \n\nMy sibling, Grace (31) recently got out of a very committed relationship (not her first - Has a tendency to fall easily.) Growing up, she and our two brothers could do no wrong. I was expected to pull more than my fair share. Always. I graduated a year early from HS, took that scholarship to a University, and managed to get fixed with a pretty sweet online job. The others didn\u2019t do higher education and get family handouts regularly. As for Grace, she fell for the boy next door - and then another - and then another.\n\nI understand looking for love but she goes all in and digs a hole. I\u2019ve always been there to help her but now things are extreme. She moved in with me, trashes my house (I\u2019ve never had roaches before - Found one and started crying), doesn\u2019t help with cooking, and has me paying several bills for her. \u2018I\u2019ll pay you back.\u2019 I took on a bunch of extra hours to offset her living with me and I can\u2019t even ask her to stir a pot of soup. (Which I finished prepping. I just needed her to mix so that I could finish up with some work emails.) \n\nThe worst concerns food. I am a diabetic and have to choose my food very carefully. Grace will eat through her junk food and then go for my things. I can barely keep anything in this house for long. I had a stash of sf soda that would normally last me two weeks. It was gone in two days and she tried to blame it on her child (7) who also lives here. (That child has pretty great manners. They would have asked me before getting into my soda.)\n\nGrace uses her child because she knows my parents will always have her back, particularly when it comes to their grandchild. (And no, they won\u2019t let Grace move in with them. They expect me to make things work here.) \n\nIt\u2019s been a long day (12+ Shift - Computer work, but I\u2019m still so darn tired!) My living room is trashed, no dinner set up for me to cook, and she is expecting a medal for doing a load of dishes. (She wouldn\u2019t even pick up my medication for me today.) \n\nDying for a turkey sandwich (have a special bread), I approached the fridge to find no turkey. It had been a huge family pack and we had bought it less than a week ago. (Child has been away visiting relatives this week.) \n\nNow I just want Grace out. My parents keep saying to give her time to get over the breakup and that I need to be more flexible. I realize I can be a bit anal. I\u2019m your typical cat lady (Yes, at my age). Just want to snuggle my felines and read, not listen to Grace\u2019s drama shows on full blast. I want to shuffle through my house in pajamas and not trip over her stuff. I want\u2026 I want\u2026 I want\u2026 (Anyone hearing Veruca Salt\u2019s voice can call me out. - Slightly cringing at myself too.) Maybe I am a bit much.
