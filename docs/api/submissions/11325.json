{"id": 11325, "submission_id": "11g8ht5", "title": "AITA for calling my girlfriend boring?", "selftext": "My (29M) girlfriend (25F) have been together for a little over 5 years. She\u2019s rather introverted and doesn\u2019t drink or enjoy going out. She\u2019d rather stay in and watch a movie or go to a nice dinner. I don\u2019t mind doing this sometimes, but sometimes I feel like it would be nice to have some drinks with my girlfriend. It feels like all she does is go to work, work on her dissertation, go to the gym, and sleep. \n\nThe other night I convinced her to go out to some bars. After a while she agreed but said she was tired from work and school, so she only wanted to go out for a little while. I was fine with this, but the entire time we were out she was entirely sober, acting pissed off and it was honestly not fun to be around. I got annoyed and told her her energy was bad and she said it was just because she was tired but she was enjoying the music (it didn\u2019t look like it at all). We left after a couple of hours, normally when I\u2019m with friends I like to stay out until 2-3am. \n\nThe next morning I brought up how she was acting and suggested the next time we go out  that she has just one drink to loosen up a bit and maybe it\u2019ll be more fun for her. I also said that I feel weird being the only one getting drunk and that it sucks drinkng alone. She disagreed and got mad at me saying that I need grow up and that drinking and partying aren\u2019t everything. I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019ve gone overboard going out with friends in the past and it\u2019s led to arguments that I regrettably don\u2019t remember, but I\u2019ve been depressed and going out is one thing that makes me feel better. \n\nI jokingly asked her when she got so boring and she snapped at me saying that she would rather save up for a nice vacation or go to a music festival/concerts or a nice, expensive dinner. These things are out of my budget and a vacation is only a once or twice a year thing anyway. And, when we do go on vacation she\u2019d rather do boring touristy stuff like go to museums or sight see. I told her that I don\u2019t think I can give her the life she wants and is used to (she had a very wealthy upbringing) and she called me an asshole and has been acting cold ever since.  So, AITA?\n\nTLDR: my girlfriend doesn\u2019t like going out or drinking. I jokingly called her boring and now she is mad at me.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t expect for this to take off so fast. I just wanted to add some info clarifying some things. We do have quite a bit in common overall - we met at a music festival and share a love for music. When we first started dating when she was still in undergrad we would go to concerts frequently and had a lot of fun. We have the same goofy sense of humor, we both like fitness and video games. We both like the travel, but like I said I can\u2019t afford it right now. She is used to going on luxurious vacations abroad with her family that cost $10-30k and I can\u2019t offer the same. \n\nI do love and care about her, which is why I want to go out with HER. Only going out with friends all the time is not the same. I originally liked how opposite we were because I felt like she brought balance to my life that I needed, but as I\u2019m nearing 30 I regret not doing more in my 20\u2019s and I\u2019m scared of wasting time not having fun. \n\nI admit that my word choice was stupid and while I was joking, it wasn\u2019t perceived that way.", "created_utc": 1677778084, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g8ht5/aita_for_calling_my_girlfriend_boring/", "score": 551, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe the reason why things are out of your budget is because you wasted them on your partying and drinking. I don't feel that your comment about her being boring was a joke.

She's not boring, she just has different interests and a different personality than you.  Honestly, you sound kind of annoying.  Also, not drinking doesn't make someone boring, and if you can't have fun without alcohol, I suggest looking into getting some help for yourself. Trying to push someone to drink alcohol is always an asshole move.  It's entirely her choice of whether to drink or not.  Please, just break up with her, so she can go find someone who appreciates her and shares her interests.  Because that's not you.  You're a jerk.", "YTA. You sound like an alcoholic, dude. The fact that she doesn\u2019t enjoy getting wasted with you until 2am doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s boring, it means she has different priorities.

Develop some fucking interests outside of drinking. You\u2019re the boring one.", "YTA. So you have different ideas of what is fun and what is worth spending money on, that\u2019s fine. But to try to goad her into drinking when she has repeatedly said she doesn\u2019t want to, and to call her names when she refuses, is asshole behavior. You should think about breaking up since it\u2019s pretty obvious you\u2019re not going in the same direction in life. \n\nAlso, if she says she\u2019s tired, why don\u2019t you believe her? She\u2019s working and in grad school. She\u2019s fucking tired, and it\u2019s both normal and smart of her to prioritize rest and health when she\u2019s got free time. It\u2019s fine of you to prioritize having fun and getting drinks with your buddies, but those aren\u2019t her priorities.", "YTA.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with not liking the drinking/party vibe, but rather than just accept that about her (or date someone who enjoys those things) you opt for peer pressure and insults disguised as a joke?\n\nShe's right, time to grow up, at least enough to understand that pushing someone to go out drinking with you is messed up.

She\u2019s rather introverted and doesn\u2019t drink or enjoy going out. She\u2019d rather stay in and watch a movie or go to a nice dinner. I don\u2019t mind doing this sometimes, but sometimes I feel like it would be nice to have some drinks with my girlfriend. It feels like all she does is go to work, work on her dissertation, go to the gym, and sleep. \n\nThe other night I convinced her to go out to some bars. After a while she agreed but said she was tired from work and school, so she only wanted to go out for a little while. I was fine with this, but the entire time we were out she was entirely sober, acting pissed off and it was honestly not fun to be around. I got annoyed and told her her energy was bad and she said it was just because she was tired but she was enjoying the music (it didn\u2019t look like it at all). We left after a couple of hours, normally when I\u2019m with friends I like to stay out until 2-3am. \n\nThe next morning I brought up how she was acting and suggested the next time we go out  that she has just one drink to loosen up a bit and maybe it\u2019ll be more fun for her. I also said that I feel weird being the only one getting drunk and that it sucks drinkng alone. She disagreed and got mad at me saying that I need grow up and that drinking and partying aren\u2019t everything. I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019ve gone overboard going out with friends in the past and it\u2019s led to arguments that I regrettably don\u2019t remember, but I\u2019ve been depressed and going out is one thing that makes me feel better. \n\nI jokingly asked her when she got so boring and she snapped at me saying that she would rather save up for a nice vacation or go to a music festival/concerts or a nice, expensive dinner. These things are out of my budget and a vacation is only a once or twice a year thing anyway. And, when we do go on vacation she\u2019d rather do boring touristy stuff like go to museums or sight see. I told her that I don\u2019t think I can give her the life she wants and is used to (she had a very wealthy upbringing) and she called me an asshole and has been acting cold ever since.  So, AITA?\n\nTLDR: my girlfriend doesn\u2019t like going out or drinking. I jokingly called her boring and now she is mad at me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you do that, I'll never see you!\" etc. I buckled under the pressure, ended up becoming depressed because I was neglecting the kind of life I wanted to build for myself, and then ended up drinking really heavily to numb the pain of that and related issues, one of which was just basically feeling kind of controlled and bullied by the person I was in a relationship with, but being unable to leave without her freaking out at me and attacking my character in some pretty severe ways. The alcohol consumption interfered with my academic performance and caused mood issues, like anxiety and depression. That sucked ass.
