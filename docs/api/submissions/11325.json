{"id": 11325, "submission_id": "11g8ht5", "title": "AITA for calling my girlfriend boring?", "selftext": "My (29M) girlfriend (25F) have been together for a little over 5 years. She\u2019s rather introverted and doesn\u2019t drink or enjoy going out. She\u2019d rather stay in and watch a movie or go to a nice dinner. I don\u2019t mind doing this sometimes, but sometimes I feel like it would be nice to have some drinks with my girlfriend. It feels like all she does is go to work, work on her dissertation, go to the gym, and sleep. \n\nThe other night I convinced her to go out to some bars. After a while she agreed but said she was tired from work and school, so she only wanted to go out for a little while. I was fine with this, but the entire time we were out she was entirely sober, acting pissed off and it was honestly not fun to be around. I got annoyed and told her her energy was bad and she said it was just because she was tired but she was enjoying the music (it didn\u2019t look like it at all). We left after a couple of hours, normally when I\u2019m with friends I like to stay out until 2-3am. \n\nThe next morning I brought up how she was acting and suggested the next time we go out  that she has just one drink to loosen up a bit and maybe it\u2019ll be more fun for her. I also said that I feel weird being the only one getting drunk and that it sucks drinkng alone. She disagreed and got mad at me saying that I need grow up and that drinking and partying aren\u2019t everything. I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019ve gone overboard going out with friends in the past and it\u2019s led to arguments that I regrettably don\u2019t remember, but I\u2019ve been depressed and going out is one thing that makes me feel better. \n\nI jokingly asked her when she got so boring and she snapped at me saying that she would rather save up for a nice vacation or go to a music festival/concerts or a nice, expensive dinner. These things are out of my budget and a vacation is only a once or twice a year thing anyway. And, when we do go on vacation she\u2019d rather do boring touristy stuff like go to museums or sight see. I told her that I don\u2019t think I can give her the life she wants and is used to (she had a very wealthy upbringing) and she called me an asshole and has been acting cold ever since.  So, AITA?\n\nTLDR: my girlfriend doesn\u2019t like going out or drinking. I jokingly called her boring and now she is mad at me.\n\nEdit: I didn\u2019t expect for this to take off so fast. I just wanted to add some info clarifying some things. We do have quite a bit in common overall - we met at a music festival and share a love for music. When we first started dating when she was still in undergrad we would go to concerts frequently and had a lot of fun. We have the same goofy sense of humor, we both like fitness and video games. We both like the travel, but like I said I can\u2019t afford it right now. She is used to going on luxurious vacations abroad with her family that cost $10-30k and I can\u2019t offer the same. \n\nI do love and care about her, which is why I want to go out with HER. Only going out with friends all the time is not the same. I originally liked how opposite we were because I felt like she brought balance to my life that I needed, but as I\u2019m nearing 30 I regret not doing more in my 20\u2019s and I\u2019m scared of wasting time not having fun. \n\nI admit that my word choice was stupid and while I was joking, it wasn\u2019t perceived that way.", "created_utc": 1677778084, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11g8ht5/aita_for_calling_my_girlfriend_boring/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe the reason why things are out of your budget is because you wasted them on your partying and drinking. I don't feel that your comment about her being boring was a joke.

She's not boring, she just has different interests and a different personality than you.  Honestly, you sound kind of annoying.  Also, not drinking doesn't make someone boring, and if you can't have fun without alcohol, I suggest looking into getting some help for yourself. Trying to push someone to drink alcohol is always an asshole move.  It's entirely her choice of whether to drink or not.  Please, just break up with her, so she can go find someone who appreciates her and shares her interests.  Because that's not you.  You're a jerk.", "YTA. You sound like an alcoholic, dude. The fact that she doesn\u2019t enjoy getting wasted with you until 2am doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s boring, it means she has different priorities.

But to try to goad her into drinking when she has repeatedly said she doesn\u2019t want to, and to call her names when she refuses, is asshole behavior. You should think about breaking up since it\u2019s pretty obvious you\u2019re not going in the same direction in life. \n\nAlso, if she says she\u2019s tired, why don\u2019t you believe her? She\u2019s working and in grad school. She\u2019s fucking tired, and it\u2019s both normal and smart of her to prioritize rest and health when she\u2019s got free time. It\u2019s fine of you to prioritize having fun and getting drinks with your buddies, but those aren\u2019t her priorities.", "YTA.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with not liking the drinking/party vibe, but rather than just accept that about her (or date someone who enjoys those things) you opt for peer pressure and insults disguised as a joke?\n\nShe's right, time to grow up, at least enough to understand that pushing someone to go out drinking with you is messed up.

She\u2019s rather introverted and doesn\u2019t drink or enjoy going out. She\u2019d rather stay in and watch a movie or go to a nice dinner. I don\u2019t mind doing this sometimes, but sometimes I feel like it would be nice to have some drinks with my girlfriend. It feels like all she does is go to work, work on her dissertation, go to the gym, and sleep. \n\nThe other night I convinced her to go out to some bars. After a while she agreed but said she was tired from work and school, so she only wanted to go out for a little while. I was fine with this, but the entire time we were out she was entirely sober, acting pissed off and it was honestly not fun to be around. I got annoyed and told her her energy was bad and she said it was just because she was tired but she was enjoying the music (it didn\u2019t look like it at all). We left after a couple of hours, normally when I\u2019m with friends I like to stay out until 2-3am. \n\nThe next morning I brought up how she was acting and suggested the next time we go out  that she has just one drink to loosen up a bit and maybe it\u2019ll be more fun for her. I also said that I feel weird being the only one getting drunk and that it sucks drinkng alone. She disagreed and got mad at me saying that I need grow up and that drinking and partying aren\u2019t everything. I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019ve gone overboard going out with friends in the past and it\u2019s led to arguments that I regrettably don\u2019t remember, but I\u2019ve been depressed and going out is one thing that makes me feel better. \n\nI jokingly asked her when she got so boring and she snapped at me saying that she would rather save up for a nice vacation or go to a music festival/concerts or a nice, expensive dinner. These things are out of my budget and a vacation is only a once or twice a year thing anyway. And, when we do go on vacation she\u2019d rather do boring touristy stuff like go to museums or sight see. I told her that I don\u2019t think I can give her the life she wants and is used to (she had a very wealthy upbringing) and she called me an asshole and has been acting cold ever since.  So, AITA?\n\nTLDR: my girlfriend doesn\u2019t like going out or drinking. I jokingly called her boring and now she is mad at me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The issue is that his girlfriend has her life priorities lined up and he describes himself as a depressed person who uses alcohol to cope. \n\nI agree that they aren\u2019t compatible, but again, it\u2019s really not because of their extroversion or introversion, it\u2019s because they appear to be on different life paths, and OP has resorted to trying to tear her down with insults because he is insecure about that.", "You\u2019re equating clubbing/drinking to being outgoing which just\u2026.. isn\u2019t what being outgoing is? I think these two people are incompatible, but there are so many outgoing people out here that don\u2019t need/use alcohol. \n\nOP\u2019s post indicates that he likes drinking *more than the average person* (needing his gf to drink with him, wanting to stay out till 3 am, etc). It also indicates that his gf likes drinking *less* than the average person. You\u2019re right that they\u2019re incompatible, but the issue here is the drinking- not him being outgoing.", "Nobody is saying \"introverted good,  extroverted bad\" except you. Nobody has said ANYTHING negative about being extroverted, at all. All anyone has said is, if your entire personality is going out and getting drunk, you're boring. \n\nHe could have chosen ANY other interest of his to include her on, and he chose the one she most uncomfortable with/ the one that comes with substance use that she didn't want to partake in. He is also actively upset she wouldn't drink with him and \"loosen up\". All of that, added together, doesn't paint a great picture is all. You don't push people to drink/club when they genuinely don't want to, pressure like that is not cool. There are so many other \"extroverted\" activities in the world than drinking away depression (which is, by definition, a mental health issue/dependancy).", "I didn\u2019t say he\u2019s a bad person.

Significant others need to make an effort, yes, but they DO NOT need to do every activity with their others, especially if it's something they deeply dislike. Find another activity to bond over. Period. That's how relationships work, give and take. She could have done ANYTHING else with him rather than him pushing her to a bar and pressuring her to drink. \n\nThe fact that you are so desperately defending a guy who thinks it's ok to pressure someone to drink is terrifying... but I guess if that's the hill you wanna die on,  far be it for me to teach you how to Crack an egg. \n\nHave a good day!", "A partner doesn't need to do everything their partner enjoys.
