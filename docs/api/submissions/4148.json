I don't have a problem with sharing in general, but I feel like she takes it to an extreme. For example, if I'm eating a sandwich for lunch, she'll ask for a bite and then end up taking half of it. If I have a snack, she'll finish it off without asking. And if I'm cooking dinner, she'll just help herself to whatever I'm making without even asking if I want to share.\n\nI've tried talking to her about it, but she just says that she doesn't see the problem and that sharing is natural in a relationship.

My wife does that and - I hate it.  And, of course, our daughter does it too.  She does not do it so much at home because we're all eating the same thing, but both of them do it when we eat out.  They act like they have some kind of entitlement to take bites of my food and even sips of my drink without even asking.  It is so rude.  The least they can do is ask first.  Whenever I complain they accuse me of being a grump.", "NTA. Ugh my husband does that too. He's a big food sharer and I'm a solidly go get your own. The compromise was if it was something new I'd share a bite so he could try it and see if he wanted his own or we'd agree beforehand to share. If it was just around the house food he'd go get his own", "Everyone has their preferences, but my bf and I have always just asked each other if we could make something for the other if we were fixing a meal.", "NTA.  In a relationship, everybody needs to say NO sometimes.  Not healthy otherwise.  What you care about is different what somebody else cares about.  It's all just information.", "NTA in general. If your having a sandwich or your own food it's rude as fuck to take stuff without asking and the fact she's ignoring those boundaries is a red flag.\n\nThe only exception here is when your cooking. If you live together it really depends on your own expectations and boundaries, but typically in a long term relationship when someone is cooking you always offer to cook for 2. It's just common curtsy in a relationship and that's the only case here where generally you'd be an AH for not offering. But, and big but, that's also two sided. If she never automatically cooks enough for you then you shouldn't either. But if she always cooks enough for you and your only taking issue when you cook your an ah for that part.\n\nBut taking the food you actually eating off your plate, nta. Put your foot down on it. It's cute if people want to share. It's gross and rude if their demanding it.", "NTA. If she wants food she can ask and if you say no that should be the end of it", "INFO: When you make a sandwich or cook dinner do you only do it for yourself or cook for her too?", "NTA. That level of sharing isn't actually too common in even the most romantic of relationships. And it's good to know how much she wants before you make food, so that you don't come up short. It's just common courtesy to ask, even (or especially) if you love each other.", "NTA. \"In most cases, I enjoy sharing with you, but in future I am not okay with sharing more than a single bite of my food that you ask for before taking. I know you don't understand, and that's okay, but I do need you to recognize and accept that this is a boundary for me going forward. We all have our quirks and preferences, and this is one of mine.\" If she tries to argue or change your mind, just keep repeating, \"I understand you disagree, but I need you to respect this boundary.\" If she grabs for food or tries to take more than what you are comfortable with, tell her, \"You are violating my boundary and it's not okay. Please stop.\"", "NTA\n\nI guess it comes down to totally different points of view.   \n\nIn order to help her understand that this is something you are not willing to put up with, you need to set *firm* boundaries about her taking food, and how much, with permission - not just \"this is what goes on in a relationship\" attitude; it isn't.  \n\n I've been married almost thirty years and I always ask, before I take,  if I can have a few french fries off my husband's plate.   That number he knows never exceeds five french fries.   That is my number choice, not his.   I know if I don't set a number I will keep munching on his food.  I understand he ordered french fries because he likes them and he wants to eat them - not get half or less than what he ordered.  \nHe, in turn, never gobbles up my entire sandwich if he wants to taste some of it.   I cut off a piece , or he takes a reasonable bite.     \n\nYour girlfriend's attitude is self absorbed.   You've already told her how you feel about it and she ignores you.    Set your boundaries and stand firm.", "NTA \n\nThat isn\u2019t sharing. That\u2019s taking your food. I thought you were gonna say she was taking something out of the fridge that you were saving, but man, she\u2019s literally taking the food off your plate. That\u2019s rough.", "NTA. Set your boundaries and stick to them. Say no", "NTA. Healthy boundaries help with healthy relationships. What you could try is secretly making her some of what you\u2019re eating. Then when she asks to sample your plate, \u201cmagically present her own plate\u201d.", "INFO: are you always just preparing food for yourself rather than both of you or asking her if she wants so before you prepare it?", "Info: if you live together, why on earth are you not sharing meals?!?! You have separate meals? For real?", "Maybe it is a cultural thing, but where I live, it\u2019s considered really rude to get yourself food or drink without asking the people who are around if they\u2019d like some too. In my house, if one of us is eating a snack, the other can have some. For snacks we both enjoy, we buy double so that we can just refill, no one needs to go without. \n\nThe exception to this rule is eating off of someone else\u2019s plate or taking from someone else\u2019s portion of food. That\u2019s not okay. Unless you ask for a taste of something unique and new and you get consent, and you only ask if you know the person really well and have confirmed they don\u2019t mind sharing their personal meal a bit. \n\nBut yeah - the idea that you\u2019d get yourself a burger or sandwich between meals while your partner is home without offering to include them or checking if they\u2019re also hungry (and then making a plan together to move your meal up) would earn you a \u201cYTA\u201d here in the upper Midwest. \n\nHeck, if I go downstairs for laundry or to check something in the garage and I\u2019m not even getting anything for myself, I\u2019ll ask if my partner wants me to grab them a beverage. \n\nIf you want to avoid your partner poaching food, you can just ask them if they want some too and make them their own portion (or invite them to come cook with you). \n\nIt kinda sounds like maybe the meal times you\u2019ve established aren\u2019t working for you though, if you\u2019re eating full entrees between meals. Maybe adjusting timing will make it so y\u2019all are eating together when you\u2019re hungry and then neither of you are in a position where only one of you is trying to make a meal. Odd situation!", "[deleted]", "INFO: Do you both share cooking duties and routinely split what you make, or you each make and eat your own food? \n\nImo, sharing is fine if expected and agreed upon. If not, not cool. My Italian husband once ate my leftover delivery pizza without asking (he had his own dinner out with other Italian dads that night), and it was a one-time occurance ;-)", "NAH\n\nLook, I honestly think she's right in the sense that sharing food doesn't have to be so problematic after 4 years of relationship but on the other hand everything has a limit, it's one thing to do it from time to time, another to do it often and not respect when you say no.\n\nMaybe she will understand if you explain that what bothers you is not sharing food but that she does not respect your no.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I know sometimes I do that with my partner instead of asserting myself, my feelings, or my opinions.\n\nMaybe you feel like she is right because social media and couple memes show that it's \"normal\"? I see those clips and I think that's ridiculous and totally selfish of the partners who just take half their partner's food without asking. It's a preference\u2014it's not a standard etiquette in a relationship. If she can't listen to you, acknowledge your feelings, and understand (or she understands it but doesn't agree with it), then it sounds like you two don't mesh well on this situation. What you do with that information is up to you. Maybe you're only upset that she's minimizing your feelings, in which case she needs to work on that.

Source: I'm the SO that usually wants a bite. \n\nWhen I see my partner making something I know I'll want a bite of, I will *ask* him to prepare enough for me to have a nibble without cutting into what he wanted to eat. Sometimes he says no for various reasons- that's fine and I'll ask him to leave the stuff out so I can make my own. Sometimes he asks me preemptively if he knows it's something I like, and sometimes he surprises me with my own little sample when he knows I forgot to ask. (He usually makes the Frank Reynolds \"ya make a san'wich in ya mouth!\" joke from IASIP)\n\nI stopped this whole argument cycle you're currently in by simply figuring out my munch level, communicating it in a timely manner, and respecting the word \"no.\" She's not even putting in the effort of seeing things from your point of view.", "NTA!!! Sharing is common in a relationship\u2026 within reason! Like tonight when I tried just a sip of my husbands eggnog to see if I\u2019d like it or not (it was delicious) and gave the rest back to him. There are boundaries and constantly latching on to whatever the other person is eating and finishing or taking a large portion of it would be a hard boundary for most people.

Nothing drives me crazy more than that. I have a slight problem sharing food, as it grosses me out to share \"a bite\" from a sandwich or off my plate. Sure ill give you a slice of pizza but lady you aint touching anything off my plate. I had to set this boundary with my current girlfriend early on and she said it was wierd but whatever. Side note another pet peeve is the whole \"you can make that for yourself im not hungry\" then these wenches end wanting a bowl of mac and cheese when i only made one box.
