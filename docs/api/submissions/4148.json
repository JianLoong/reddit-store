If your having a sandwich or your own food it's rude as fuck to take stuff without asking and the fact she's ignoring those boundaries is a red flag.\n\nThe only exception here is when your cooking. If you live together it really depends on your own expectations and boundaries, but typically in a long term relationship when someone is cooking you always offer to cook for 2. It's just common curtsy in a relationship and that's the only case here where generally you'd be an AH for not offering. But, and big but, that's also two sided. If she never automatically cooks enough for you then you shouldn't either. But if she always cooks enough for you and your only taking issue when you cook your an ah for that part.\n\nBut taking the food you actually eating off your plate, nta. Put your foot down on it. It's cute if people want to share. It's gross and rude if their demanding it.", "NTA.

That level of sharing isn't actually too common in even the most romantic of relationships. And it's good to know how much she wants before you make food, so that you don't come up short. It's just common courtesy to ask, even (or especially) if you love each other.", "NTA. \"In most cases, I enjoy sharing with you, but in future I am not okay with sharing more than a single bite of my food that you ask for before taking. I know you don't understand, and that's okay, but I do need you to recognize and accept that this is a boundary for me going forward. We all have our quirks and preferences, and this is one of mine.\" If she tries to argue or change your mind, just keep repeating, \"I understand you disagree, but I need you to respect this boundary.\" If she grabs for food or tries to take more than what you are comfortable with, tell her, \"You are violating my boundary and it's not okay. Please stop.\"", "NTA\n\nI guess it comes down to totally different points of view.   \n\nIn order to help her understand that this is something you are not willing to put up with, you need to set *firm* boundaries about her taking food, and how much, with permission - not just \"this is what goes on in a relationship\" attitude; it isn't.  \n\n I've been married almost thirty years and I always ask, before I take,  if I can have a few french fries off my husband's plate.   That number he knows never exceeds five french fries.   That is my number choice, not his.   I know if I don't set a number I will keep munching on his food.  I understand he ordered french fries because he likes them and he wants to eat them - not get half or less than what he ordered.  \nHe, in turn, never gobbles up my entire sandwich if he wants to taste some of it.   I cut off a piece , or he takes a reasonable bite.     \n\nYour girlfriend's attitude is self absorbed.   You've already told her how you feel about it and she ignores you.    Set your boundaries and stand firm.", "NTA \n\nThat isn\u2019t sharing. That\u2019s taking your food. I thought you were gonna say she was taking something out of the fridge that you were saving, but man, she\u2019s literally taking the food off your plate. That\u2019s rough.", "NTA. Set your boundaries and stick to them. Say no", "NTA. Healthy boundaries help with healthy relationships. What you could try is secretly making her some of what you\u2019re eating.

In my house, if one of us is eating a snack, the other can have some. For snacks we both enjoy, we buy double so that we can just refill, no one needs to go without. \n\nThe exception to this rule is eating off of someone else\u2019s plate or taking from someone else\u2019s portion of food. That\u2019s not okay. Unless you ask for a taste of something unique and new and you get consent, and you only ask if you know the person really well and have confirmed they don\u2019t mind sharing their personal meal a bit. \n\nBut yeah - the idea that you\u2019d get yourself a burger or sandwich between meals while your partner is home without offering to include them or checking if they\u2019re also hungry (and then making a plan together to move your meal up) would earn you a \u201cYTA\u201d here in the upper Midwest. \n\nHeck, if I go downstairs for laundry or to check something in the garage and I\u2019m not even getting anything for myself, I\u2019ll ask if my partner wants me to grab them a beverage. \n\nIf you want to avoid your partner poaching food, you can just ask them if they want some too and make them their own portion (or invite them to come cook with you). \n\nIt kinda sounds like maybe the meal times you\u2019ve established aren\u2019t working for you though, if you\u2019re eating full entrees between meals. Maybe adjusting timing will make it so y\u2019all are eating together when you\u2019re hungry and then neither of you are in a position where only one of you is trying to make a meal. Odd situation!", "[deleted]", "INFO: Do you both share cooking duties and routinely split what you make, or you each make and eat your own food? \n\nImo, sharing is fine if expected and agreed upon.
