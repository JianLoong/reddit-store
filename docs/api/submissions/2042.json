My mom said since my niece is their first grandchild of course they have to spoil her.\n\nMy kids were sitting in the living room with all of us and my youngest daughter looked hurt when she realized what my mother said.

I didn\u2019t want my kids to keep sitting there and listening to that so I handed my son my keys and told him to wait in the car with his sisters. When they were gone, I asked my parents why the hell they\u2019d say that my kids weren\u2019t their grandchildren, and my mom said they couldn\u2019t be their grandchildren because they weren\u2019t really my children.\n\nMy wife and I were going to be hosting thanksgiving at our house this year, but I told my parents that if they didn\u2019t view my kids as their family, then they could just host a meal at their own house with their \u201creal\u201d family while I spent the holiday with mine.\n\nI left before they could say anything else to me, and my wife and I have reiterated to the children that they will always be my kids and I will always be their other mom, regardless of our DNA.\n\nMy brother is pissed at me now because he thinks I reacted too harshly, and that I should try to see where my parents are coming from.

Kelvin was just a toddler of 3 (edit from baby as that\u2019s another age in my language)when they started dating.\nThey never claimed him as a grandchild, which they would have if they\u2019d gotten married, but they treated him just like the grandkids they had (better in fact) for the nine years my aunt dated his dad. \n\nYou can absolutely love and care for someone without giving them a title. Where your parents truly messed up was insisting in front of the kids. \n\nPlus Sara, who dealt awesomely I must say what a trooper and quick thinker, might have hit the nail on the head with the baby comment: It\u2019s the first time they get to be there from the start. \n\nAnd suck as it might it does make a difference to most people. \n\nI still 100% say you didn\u2019t overreact, but maybe talk to them again and clear the air if you can.", "NTA\n\nYour parents were deeply wrong.   \n\n> My mom texted saying that she and my dad love the kids, but they still aren\u2019t their grandchildren, and she hopes that we can come to understand that because she doesn\u2019t want this to ruin my niece\u2019s first thanksgiving.\n\nThey're just digging themselves deeper, aren't they.", "I like that Sara tried to fix it, and your parents' opinion is fine, but not in front of your children.

You can\u2019t force people to think as you do, but you can insist on behaviour that is appropriate. NTA but I would hesitate to cut off people who treat your kids well and that they love. \n\nFamilies are not only blood ties of course, your family do seem to respect your kids and love them, your mum even said so. Isn\u2019t that half the battle? They are chosen family and loved but technically your parents are correct.

I\u2019m in my mid 30\u2019s now and I STILL remember how I felt when someone I had always thought of as a cousin said that. I rarely talk to him and if I do I keep it short.

That\u2019s got to be so upsetting for the kids. It would have been so very easy for your parents to just say they were excited for the first baby just to spare your children\u2019s feelings, but they didn\u2019t even care enough to do that much. That\u2019s cold. Very cold.\n\nNTA and if I were Ivan and Sara I\u2019d be very concerned with how your parents clear favoritism would impact their daughter\u2019s relationship with her cousins.

Your step children are of no relation to them\u2026lol. C\u2019mon now, basic Biology teaches you this.

To the children, your parents are the grandparents just like you explained.  \n\n\nFrom your parent's POV, their grandchild is someone to pass their genetics on, to continue the family. It's the very old-fashioned view of having children, like the 'importance' of having a son in some families to pass the last-name on. A kind of legacy. Of course, for your parents, your children won't be in the same range as your niece as none of these children hold any of your, and ultimately, their DNA.  \n\n\nI don't think your parents really don't consider your children as family. To me, it sounds like a careless comment they absolutely didn't think through.

My mom and her oldest brother were adopted by her stepdad at 9 & 5 years old.  He was their dad in every aspect.  I was the first grandchild born and he was an amazing and loving grandpa.

I was also adopted as a child and this makes their actions inhuman, vile and absolutely disgusting.

The key would be to tell them to please never say something like that in front of the kids again. \n\nYou aren't the asshole, but I am not sure this needs to boil over because of wording, more not saying those things in front of the kids.\n\nEDIT\n\nIn your original post you lay out the timeline clearly and make no mention of an adoption.

I imagine the brother thinks he\u2019s being neutral, trying to get everyone to get along equally, but doesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s coming across as an endorsement of parents words, because he probably has never experienced a microaggression like his queer sister or her adopted children.

For you, on the other hand -- this is a good hill to die on.  Because your kids need you more than ever now.  Your parents rejected them; it will mean a lot to them to know that you will reject your parents, and your brother, if this is how they treat your kids.

It can be hard for kids to really understand familial rifts like this.  And it might be easier for the kids to accept an apology and change of heart (or change of behavior) from your parents, than it may be for you.  But that assumes getting your parents to a place where they can apologize and change their behavior.  I feel like, on some level, your kids would notice if things died down and you resumed contact while never receiving an apology. (But of course, you know them best!

Like, why wouldn't she just stay with Ross-- who is, you know, her DAD???", "the least horrible human in that show is joey...\n the womanizer.... \n\nall the others are despicable people to the core. \n\nJoey at least seems to understand he shouldnt hurt people, but being mentally incapable of tying his own shoes, he's oblivious to his own treatment of women.", "I always assumed both twins shared the role. But that brings up an interesting question. \n\nIf only Cole was playing Ben, what does his financial situation with Friends look like?\n\nThat show is well known for making the actors $$$$ well after it ended\u2026\n\nI have to assume Cole was paid per episode with nothing in his contract about syndication. \n\nOtherwise, how crazy awkward would that be for the Sprouse twins to discuss as adults?\n\n\u201cMom and dad only put YOU in the show that pays you $20k/year for life, or more every time a rerun episode you were in is on TBS. Why wasn\u2019t I on that show too?\u201d\n\nIt sounds like they are both doing very well and not hurting for money, but wow\u2026Had they faded away like most child stars do, that would be a huge income disparity depending on how the pay worked for Cole on the show.", "Come on. It was a GOOD sandwich.", "The moist maker!", "Glad to see another Joey defender out there, he was always a good dude deep down. He handled his feelings for Rachel way better than Ross did, honestly.", "And it wasn't just any food. It was a leftover Thanksgiving sandwich.  I dream of tasting that sandwich.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Oh that\u2019s right! That\u2019s what i\u2019d sound like if i exploded!!", "Right!  It had the Moist-maker^tm gravy soaked bread layer in the middle!", "That's horrible. Is the kids' father and his parents in their lives?", "Someone on my dad's side of the family once said something about my oldest sister not being family (as my dad adopted her, she's biologically my half-sister, but has never been anything but my sister). That was over 35 years ago, the person who said it was a child who got a scolding and a stern talking to by their parents and apologised to my sister as they realised it was hurtful. It's never been brought up since. \n\nI can't see how your parents could get back from this, because they don't seem to want to, or even understand or care that the way they expressed their feelings was hurtful. If they care at all about your children, they should understand that they keep such things to themselves if they feel like adopted children aren't \"real\" grandchildren. I'm so so sorry, it must hurt so much to see your own parents hurting your children.", "They didn\u2019t just double down\u2026. \n\nThey tripped down.", "Yeah, I was REALLY looking for some room to give the parents a little bit of grace here as I read the post, because it is different and easy to get carried away when you've been involved through the whole process (pregnancy - birth - baby!).   \n\nBut to double down in front of the older children that they are not your grandkids is unforgivable.   It's hurtful and cruel.   \n\nMy first question was, \"Well, what do the kids call OP's parents?\"  Because if they call them by their names, yeah, I could see the attachment between both parties might not be that strong.  But no, my OP's parents' request they call them Nana & Pop.   Personal reference, I met my ex when my daughter was an older teenager and she met my MIL as an adult.  I asked MIL what she'd prefer my daughter call her (as with my daughter's age it wasn't like she'd be as close as MIL's grandkids).  She said whatever my daughter would be comfortable with and told her that her kids call her Nana or she can call her by her first name, just go with what feels best.    \n\nSecond thought was, \"Okay, yeah, some people get scared to get attached to the step-family because if there's a divorce they might not get to see them again.\"   But again, that excuse is foiled.  OP adopted the kids a few years ago.   \n\nTo wrap this up, any out that I saw to give the parents leeway was closed down.  OP is NTA but the parents are for sure.  There's not a lot that truly makes me angry, but being cruel to children really gets me worked up.", "I didn't even know my grandpa wasn't my biological one til I was like 12! And I had to ASK bc I noticed my mom called him by name, instead of \"Dad\". \n\nI'd just never even THOUGHT he wasn't my \"real\" Grandfather. He treated us all like his own- including my mom! That man was too sweet for this world. \u2764\ufe0f", "No, my wife was pregnant with the youngest when she left him. I won't go into the details but he wasn't very kind to her, she got a restraining order years ago and he lost all rights to them. I don't think his parents ever wanted much to do with them either.", "This is a fantastic answer. These kids are ADOPTED!! I mean\u2026 how utterly awful the grandparents are. \n\nPlease update us OP\u2026 and I hope you and your beautiful children are ok no matter what happens.\n\nPS, Your sister in Law is wonderful.", "Yeah, like, that baby won't remember her first Thanksgiving, but when she gets older she's going to wonder why her cousins aren't considered grandchildren like she is. Kids aren't daft. They know when things aren't equal between them.", "The phone triple down is what blows my mind. How in the world is THIS the hill that she wants to die on? Kids that have called you Nana for YEARS, you're going to insist are not your grandchildren just for...what? What is she even getting out of this if she \"won\"? Is there a Pedant of the Year Award she's gunning for?", "My grandpa was actually my grandma's second husband and I didn't even know til I was like 12.\n\nAnd no one had told me, I just realized my mom always called him by name, instead of calling him Dad, when she still called my grandma \"Mama\". So I asked why she called him by his first name and she told me.\n\nBut my grandma and grandpa had been married since before I was born.. that man never treated me or my older brothers (I think eldest was 5ish when they got married?) like anything but his grandchildren. We were family, and he treated my mom like his own too. \n\nAnd I won't go into details, but let's just say that from what ive learned, my biological grandfather deserves to die scared and alone, knowing it's coming for him, screaming in pain the entire time. \n\nI'll take my \"fake\" Grandpa, thanks. Blood doesn't mean anything.", "Bring me all the bonus grandchildren. I have cookies and candy and hot chocolate for all y'all", "Yes.  My husband and I call the first 2 stages the wet noodle stage (when they can't hold their head up) and the potted plant stage (when they can sit up in a Bumbo but can't go anywhere).", "I'm in my 40's. I remember last Thanksgiving, but I'd be hard pressed to remember any others. Definitely not any from before I was a teen. \n \ud83e\udd23", "However I wouldn\u2019t downright assume her brother completely isn\u2019t on her side, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s enough information necessarily in the post to determine that. His comment at the end may have been a bit insensitive as he didn\u2019t realize how it impacted his sister but OP doesn\u2019t hint at any other problems, if anything they seemed fine before the parents showed up. \n\nTo me it seems as likely that the brother could also just be overtly panicked as he feels very caught in the middle of an admittedly bad, awkward argument and isn\u2019t yet in the best spot to better mediate.", "Thank you. Muchas gracias por contestar. Es muy cierto y que mensaje tan hermoso.", "Soooo trifling. Please do all of the emotional and actual work for the \u201creal\u201d grandchild\u2019s first t-gives they won\u2019t even remember. \ud83d\ude44 Her parents sound truly insufferable.", "Absolutely a Foot in Mouth moment! Normally, people cringe inside when this happens! Realize their unfortunate foot should be swallowed and choked on...then must apologize for the digression.", "I agree, my point was basically OP understands microaggressions in a way her brother might not be able to! She understands the way \u201cminor\u201d instances of being made to feel lesser can feel really big and hurtful. Her brother, in trying to be the peacemaker, is indicating he may not understand the severity of the comments that were made.\n\nBut being gay does feel like it plays into it a little. She\u2019s probably experienced some microaggressions that come from being at the intersection of gay and an adoptive mom. (\u201cSo which oft your moms is your real mom?\u201d \u201cOh but your kids don\u2019t look anything like you!\u201d \u201cOh so they\u2019re not like your REAL kids, like you didn\u2019t give birth to them or anything!\u201d)\n\nETA: Also it does beg the question: what is it about the way their family came together that makes the kids invalid in the grandparents eyes? Is it that they came from a previous relationship? If OP\u2019s wife carried a baby that the two of them had planned, would that child be their grandchild? If not, then there\u2019s really no way they can ever have legitimate grandchildren in their parents eyes, which I would say IS homophobic. Not that that\u2019s any better or worse than not recognizing that OP adopted the kids and is in their life for the long-haul, but it would answer the root of the question \u201cwhat\u2019s their freaking deal?\u201d", "Yes this stuck out to me too. OP has adopted all the children officially too though. Would the grandparents not recognise any adopted children as real family/grandchildren? What if one of their kids was infertile? \n\nTo have a view of family based solely on genetics is whack IMO, and it also does open the door to homophobia IMO as well. (The whole, you're not a really family because you can't have biological children argument is sickening).", "And the thread is Friendsjacked.", "Yeah, that\u2019s kinda what I was getting at, OP, as a queer adoptive mom has probably encountered microaggressions about being gay or not being their \u201creal mom\u201d forever. Whereas her straight brother might not have really encountered microsaggressions and therefore is perceiving this as a \u201cminor\u201d incident bc he doesn\u2019t really understand how hurtful microaggressions can feel.  Or maybe he does, he just feels caught up in the middle. \n\nEither way that\u2019s a hard place to be, and I understand his desire for everything to go back to the way things were. Unfortunately that was a majorly hurtful and invalidating statement. It hurt the kids, which is hard for parents to overcome. She even says it bothers her bc the kids were present, if it was just invalidating her, and they weren\u2019t there that\u2019d be one thing, but knowing how it broke their hearts was what upset her most. \n\nIt does beg the question is this about the fact that they come from a previous marriage or is it a little bit, deep down homophobia? Like if her wife had carried a baby but it had been planned between the two of them, would that be their grandchild?", "Functionally Ross missed his third wedding too.", "It\u2019s just not worth it if it\u2019s not a headboard.", "They're far worse than potted plants.\n\nMy potted plants can be ignored for days and not die. They also don't scream or poop.", "They really weren't your family, and it's not because of biology, but because they didn't care about you at all. I'm sorry, you deserved better.", "On the other hand, showing your children how to set boundaries when people disrespect them and standing up for them so they know that you support them and always have their back can go a long way towards confidence building. But only in this case since the children already heard what their former grandparents had said. Otherwise I wouldn\u2019t go into detail, just a simple \u201cthey disrespected our family and I no longer think it\u2019s healthy to keep them in our lives\u201d would suffice. Just my opinion though, otherwise you run the risk of them finding out you lied to them for years when they\u2019re older and you end up looking like the bad person in that scenario.", "My youngest was 8 when I met my husband and now at 14, says he doesn't remember a time before husband was in our lives.

Now her baby is in the middle of all this stupid drama where grandparents doubled and tripled down on being\u2026what, homophobic? Anti adoptive kids? Mixture?\n\nThis smells like brother was the golden child a bit also, considering that he\u2019s upset about OP rocking the boat.\n\nNTA, OP\u2026you keep being an amazing mother to your kiddos. I can\u2019t see how this gets better really, but I hope it can get as better as possible for your kids. I think you and them and your wife having your own little Thanksgiving sounds perfect.", "THIS. It speaks volumes that after grandparents turned OP's family upside down, they have the audacity to expect a happy family thanksgiving celebration. SMH and OP is absolutely NTA.", "The baby isn\u2019t even going to remember her first thanksgiving, but those older kids definitely will \u2014 and not for the right reasons, either. Poor kiddos.", "Then again, shows often forget about minor characters. It bothered me that for example Phoebe's brother, his wife and their triplets as well as Phoebe's birthmother were not at her wedding.", "I'm not sure it's homophobia. Could be, but could also be that people (particularly old ones) can be obsessive about only biological children being \"real\". Sounds like they thought of OP's kids as placeholders until the \"real\" one came along. Whatever their reasoning, OP is NTA. Parents def are and brother is heading that way. Agree SIL is a rockstar, but I wouldn't tolerate the rest.\n\nOP should protect her children, even if it means shitcanning them all.", "Married With Children.
