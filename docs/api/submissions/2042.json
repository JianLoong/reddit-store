Kelvin was just a toddler of 3 (edit from baby as that\u2019s another age in my language)when they started dating.\nThey never claimed him as a grandchild, which they would have if they\u2019d gotten married, but they treated him just like the grandkids they had (better in fact) for the nine years my aunt dated his dad. \n\nYou can absolutely love and care for someone without giving them a title. Where your parents truly messed up was insisting in front of the kids. \n\nPlus Sara, who dealt awesomely I must say what a trooper and quick thinker, might have hit the nail on the head with the baby comment: It\u2019s the first time they get to be there from the start. \n\nAnd suck as it might it does make a difference to most people. \n\nI still 100% say you didn\u2019t overreact, but maybe talk to them again and clear the air if you can.", "NTA\n\nYour parents were deeply wrong.   \n\n> My mom texted saying that she and my dad love the kids, but they still aren\u2019t their grandchildren, and she hopes that we can come to understand that because she doesn\u2019t want this to ruin my niece\u2019s first thanksgiving.\n\nThey're just digging themselves deeper, aren't they.", "I like that Sara tried to fix it, and your parents' opinion is fine, but not in front of your children.

You can\u2019t force people to think as you do, but you can insist on behaviour that is appropriate. NTA but I would hesitate to cut off people who treat your kids well and that they love. \n\nFamilies are not only blood ties of course, your family do seem to respect your kids and love them, your mum even said so. Isn\u2019t that half the battle? They are chosen family and loved but technically your parents are correct.

That\u2019s got to be so upsetting for the kids. It would have been so very easy for your parents to just say they were excited for the first baby just to spare your children\u2019s feelings, but they didn\u2019t even care enough to do that much. That\u2019s cold. Very cold.\n\nNTA and if I were Ivan and Sara I\u2019d be very concerned with how your parents clear favoritism would impact their daughter\u2019s relationship with her cousins.

To the children, your parents are the grandparents just like you explained.  \n\n\nFrom your parent's POV, their grandchild is someone to pass their genetics on, to continue the family. It's the very old-fashioned view of having children, like the 'importance' of having a son in some families to pass the last-name on. A kind of legacy. Of course, for your parents, your children won't be in the same range as your niece as none of these children hold any of your, and ultimately, their DNA.  \n\n\nI don't think your parents really don't consider your children as family. To me, it sounds like a careless comment they absolutely didn't think through.

My mom and her oldest brother were adopted by her stepdad at 9 & 5 years old.  He was their dad in every aspect.  I was the first grandchild born and he was an amazing and loving grandpa.

And I\u2019ve always felt a distance with my extended family and my mom has never helped bridge the gap. I am so glad your kids have you and your wife as a wonderful support system and stood up to them right there. You didn\u2019t wait until later. You showed them that their comments weren\u2019t okay and are hurtful. Thank you so much for standing up for your kids.", "NTA\n\nYou need to protect your children first. They did nothing wrong and do not deserve to be treated that way.", "NTA. Your parents seemed to be fine letting your kids consider them grandparents for *years*. Nothing should change just because someone has squirted out a baby they share DNA with. That means this whole time they've really only considered your kids some kind of twisted consolation prize.\n\nAnd as if that wasn't heartbreaking enough, they decide it's fine to say this *with your children in the room*?! That's absolutely vile, and even if they apologise and backpedal I'd think twice about the level of contact and intimacy they're allowed with your children.\n\nYou did exactly the right thing, and don't let *anyone* lead you to believe otherwise.", "NTA at all ! Gee.. they are worried about ruining your niece's first Thanksgiving? One she surely won't remember ?!  No concern at all  for the  grandchildren who are already there?? I'm so sorry they are awful people. Enjoy your day without them.", "NTA. And I'm sorry because this sounds like an awful choice to have to make, but if your parents refuse to admit any fault then they're probably going to keep saying things like this. You can't let your kids be around that.\n\nI'm just so sad for you and your wife and kids.", "NTA.   They are your babies.   It is your job to protect them.   That was really ignorant of them.   They could have at least not said it in front of your babies.   So no.  Just make your own family tradition and keep on loving your babies.", "NTA.  Tell them that if they\u2019re convinced they\u2019ve only got one grandkid whose holidays they need to worry about ruining, *they* need to understand that *you* will be spending the holidays with *your* family so as not to ruin *your* celebration with their attitude.  Period.", "NTA and I'd respond to all of them that, until they accept your children as family, you will not host or attend family events. That what they said hurt your kids and made them feel unloved and unwanted and that is not, is NEVER, acceptable, so it's better for your kids to not be around people who feel the way they do.", "NTA but what seems weird here is that everyone is behaving fine except this one instance - actions seem way more important that semantics, and you indicate they treat the kids as grandkids. \n\nTechnically they are step grandchildren. \n\nI am not sure doubling down on working is the key take away. The key would be to tell them to please never say something like that in front of the kids again. \n\nYou aren't the asshole, but I am not sure this needs to boil over because of wording, more not saying those things in front of the kids.", "NTA. You niece may be the first child born to their children, but not their first grandchild. Respond by explaining how hurtful their comnents were to you and your kids and ask if the kids had been adopted by you and your wife would they feel the same.", "OP, would you have the same course of action, if they hadn't said it infront of all the kids?", "NTA. My family treats my bonus kiddo just like one of the others. They\u2019d never dream of saying something like that.", "NTA if they hadn't said it in front of the children out would be forgivable.", "NTA- good job standing up for your kids, and at the very least you all need a cooling off period.  Please talk with them about what was said and how they feel about it.  See how it affected them, and explain that they are not blood related, but blood doesn\u2019t make a family.  Hopefully you can get some incite and go back to your parents to explain how their words affected the kids, and work with them to fix it.\nAlso to throw in my favorite suggestion, nursing homes and other elder care facilities have lots of people wishing for the chance to be someone\u2019s grandparent.  This not only gives them more gram\u201dgrandparents\u201d but also reinforces the fact that family isn\u2019t necessarily blood.", "NTA. You adopted these children and your parents just rejected them to their faces. How do you come back from that? How do you make them sit through Christmas, watching the \"real grandchild\" get spoilt while they try to explain to the 8 year old how she's not really theirs anymore, she's been replaced, but she has to just understand where her ex-grandparents are coming from. Because that's what your parents basically said; Your family are props for their darling little girl's first thanksgiving! \n\nAnd I'd make your brother say it. Say where he thinks your parents are coming from. Because there's nothing nice or kind behind those words. You might as well get it all out in the open, so Sara doesn't get the wrong idea about the cruel family she just married into.\n\nI feel really bad for your kids. I don't know if I'd ever look at your parents the same way again. The casual cruelty is just breathtaking.", "Sweetheart, do whatever you can to protect your kids from these people. \n\nNTA", "INFO \n\nHave you adopted your wife\u2019s children?", "NTA, because saying that in front of your ADOPTED (not merely step) children is completely uncalled for. They can think what they want, but they should be adult enough to realize how hurtful voicing that opinion was.", "YTA. They already have 2 set of grandparents. You should not force your parents to feel a certain way. Blood is always thicker than water. When they look at their niece they can see themselves. It\u2019s like that theory that all baby\u2019s look like their dad at birth so the father doesn\u2019t reject them.", "I mean it is their first grandchild. YTA", "ESH. They absolutely shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve said that in front of the children; totally tactless. I would\u2019ve been pissed too. But you said that they\u2019ve always treated them as their own, so maybe going scorched earth was a bit far. I don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re going to start treating your children as less than all of a sudden, do you? It\u2019s Ann unfortunate truth that not everyone is built the way we want them to be, but we have to work with what we\u2019re given. Have a happy holiday season regardless.", "NTA. Thank you for being an awesome mom and standing up for them.  The fact your parents care more about a newborns feelings for Thanksgiving than the kids they have treated like grandchildren for years speaks volumes.  Your kids were \u2018fillers\u2019; stand-ins for when they\u2019d have biological grandchildren.  They basically always felt this way but there was never a reason for it to come up.  I don\u2019t know that there is a way to fix this.  They\u2019re not going to change how they feel.  You\u2019re not going to convince them.  And now the kids know.  The worms are out of the can and you can\u2019t put them back or rug sweep it.  You\u2019ve taken a good first step in making Thanksgiving just y\u2019all.  And in case it\u2019s not obvious, NTA.", "YTA- They are allowed to recognize the difference and be happy to have a biological grandchild. Your admit yourself that your kids have been treated well by your parents. They can care for your kids but unfortunately they will never be a true grandchild.", "Yeah the doubling down in front of the kids was what made them AHs for me. I could understand if it\u2019s a slip of the tongue; few people see stepchildren as grandchildren, but they usually at least have the courtesy of keeping that thought to themselves.", "They said this in front of the kids.", "Honestly, who gives a shit. If your grandparents said you weren\u2019t really their grandkid you be hurt. Period.", ">Do you think it's a coping mechanism? Could they be thinking if you were to divorce they wouldn't be able to see the children again?\n\nI would say that they should understand that it would not be an issue, as OP has legally adopted them, which would give her the same rights to visitation that her spouse has.", "Wow, you couldn't be a more callous and insensitive person if you tried.", "Prime example of why 12 year olds shouldn\u2019t weigh in on situations like this.", "Then they should have kept their distance from those children from the beginning. You can\u2019t show up as a granny to a child and then years later do a 360 now that there is someone out there who is \u201cbetterly and more conveniently related\u201d.", "They\u2019re not her \u201cstep-kids\u201d, they are her kids. Biology isn\u2019t the only thing that makes a family.\n\nOP is NTA. For OP\u2019s parents to say what they did, and in front of the children no less, is fucking disgraceful.", "Oh, you mean the same parents that allowed the kids to call them Nana and Pop for the last 8 years, those ones? Yeah, you can miss me with that bs. NTA.", "Yikes. \n\nGenetics mean nothing when it comes to family, other than they\u2019re more likely to be a match for organ donation.", "Why would they allow themselves to be called grandparents by the children?  Why wouldn\u2019t they have created that distance from the outset?  To allow children to call you nana/pop pop or whatever, treat you as family but then all of a sudden, though no fault of theirs, decide otherwise, is unreasonably cruel of OPs parents.  They made a choice on how they wanted to relate to these children and backpedaling is vile", "\"New babies are like potted plants...\"\n\nThat line had me rolling. So true. Actually, everything you said is spot on.", "\ud83d\ude39 absolutely\u203c\ufe0f", "Right? Go Sara! Keep that woman in your life she knows what\u2019s up.", "OP responded elsewhere that they did indeed adopt them 4 years ago.", "OP says in a comment they adopted the kids 4 years ago so they are deffo TA. To me only Op and Sara are NTA because Sara tried to correct/fix it and they just doubled down", "Yes, they've been legally my kids for 4yrs now but even before then I still considered them mine.", "The worst part of it for me is that they said it in front of them. I'd still be upset knowing they thought it, but the look on my youngest daughter's face when she heard my mother say that just broke my heart.\n\nI tend to go mama bear whenever I even think someone has stepped out of line with the kids, so I was worried that maybe I was doing too much in my reaction. My brother still feels like I should talk it out with them, but I don't know that I could forgive it honestly.", "My heart dropped for those kids! I can't imagine what they were feeling.", "To be fair, OP's parents haven't fully explained why OP's adopted kids don't count as grandchildren. We don't know that it's based on genetics, based on homophobia, based on pigmentation, based on a misunderstanding, or what. Filling in the blanks for OP's parents isn't really fair.\n\n> I don't think your parents really don't consider your children as family...it is also a bit important to understand that it wasn't their intention.\n\nThey really doubled down on OP's kids not being their grandkids, though. They said what they meant and they meant what they said. What part of OP's post implied they were thoughtless or saying something unintended? OP's wife threw them an opportunity to self-correct and they reasserted themselves. \n\nUltimately, that is going to mean OP's kids will perceive being treated as lesser from here on out. Parents who double down like OP's are not going to treat the kids equally or equitably. They've clearly expressed that the difference matters to them.\n\n> Did they never treat your children with presents?\n\nIt doesn't matter if they bought OP's kids presents in the past. The contrast didn't exist in the past.", "Am I the only one who noticed that the only reason they want peace is to not ruin the new baby's first Thanksgiving? Everything has to be about the baby despite the fact that she won't even remember it. These people are ridiculous.", "No, but she surely can cancel Thanksgiving at her house so they can take their \u201cblood family\u201d to eat at Golden Corral.", "How about she can expect them not to say such hurtful things in front of the kids who are already consider her their grandmother?", "This response made me think of Ross's dad in the Friends episode, where Rachel gives birth. \n\nJack Gellar: \"My first grandchild!\"\n\nRoss: \"What about Ben?\"\n\nJack Gellar: \"Well of course Ben, I meant my first grand*daughter!\"*\n\nNice save Grandpa Gellar!\n\nAlthough seriously, either Ross is a deadbeat dad to Ben, or the show just decided it was inconvenient to keep writing him and the ex-wife in.", "No kidding. She gave them an out and instead they doubled down.", "I am so sorry that anyone ever said something so cruel to you, especially as a child. Family is so much more than blood.", "It sounds like genetics pure-blooding to me.\n\nOP didn\u2019t contribute the eggs or carry the babies, so her parents don\u2019t consider them relations.\n\nI\u2019m sure if she were birth mother of one of her kids, her parents\u2019 favoritism would have revealed itself long ago.", "I hate it so much honestly. My wife's parents have wanted nothing to do with her since she came out, so my parents were the only grandparents our kids really had. I had no idea that they felt like this about my children the whole time.", "They are their grandchildren, OP has adopted them", "OP adopted the kids, they aren\u2019t technically stepgrandkids.  Legally, they are grandchildren with the same rights vis a vis OP as if they were born to her.", "No. OP adopted the children 4 years ago. They are her children in all sense of the word. \nThey are not step-children. They are not step grandchildren", "OP said in a comment that she in fact adopted the kids four years ago so they are her children and her parents are even more the assholes.", "No, I think I would've just sat down with them and talked about it had it not been said in front of the kids. It would definitely hurt my feelings to know that they felt that way, but I'd want them to explain to me why they were okay with being Nana and Pop for 8 years if those have never been their grandkids in their eyes.", "That doesn't change much", "The issue is not about the reality of the situation, but how callously OP's mom handled it and how hurtful she was. She does not even apologize, but instead wants peace so as not to ruin her first and only grandchild's first Thanksgiving. No care at all for how she hurt the kids that have called her Grandma since they were babies.", "Is just that their other three grandkids weren\u2019t aware of that until just now.\n\nI think \u201cwell, why the hell have we been spending so much time with these non-grandparent boomers then?\u201d is a natural response to the revelation.\n\nNTA", "You're a step kids don't count as kids person.  Chill.  What about adopted kids, it's the same thing since they aren't biologically related I suppose?", "Yeah, but you don't SAY that in front of kids that have been in the family for EIGHT years.", "It is their first grandbaby as Sara said, those kids are in the family from 8y now, their daughter is their mom so they are grandkids.", "OP has adopted the children.  \n\nThey are indeed grandchildren, even if they are not biological grandchildren.", "They\u2019ve already started treating them as less than, when they literally said the children weren\u2019t their grandchildren, in front of them.", "Sure you feel that way\u2026.but it\u2019s clear OP\u2019s parents don\u2019t. Lol", "This is an important point to note. Adopted children are your children in every sense of the word. That makes them your parent's grandchildren in every sense of the word.", "If you've adopted these children then I do think they are assholes for declaring that they are not their grandchildren.\n\nI wonder if what they are doing now is setting/lowering expectations for inheritance/financial gifts. Do they have money? Have they given/saved money for college funds for your children and do you think maybe they'll do that for your brother's kid(s)?  \n\nIf they die in twenty years and leave a lot of money to their \"grandchildren\" would you have expected your adopted children to share in that? \n\nMaybe they are trying to set ground rules explaining why their biological grandchildren will be treated differently, financially speaking.\n\nThat said, you've mentioned that your parents love and accept your kids and always treat them as family, which is the mot important thing, so perhaps it's not worth getting hung up on terminology. It does seem harsh to cut them out of family gatherings and try to force them to \"Say they are your grandkids! Say it! No turkey and cranberry sauce unless you say it!\"", "I would then talk to my parents and explain to them that legally they ARE their grandchildren so not only are they mean but also wrong, legally.\n\nSo they hurt the kids feelings and they are ignorant of basic reality while doing so. It's not their *option*, it's not subjective, they ARE their grandchildren.", "Your brother is more concerned about his daughters first Thanksgiving.  Let's be real.  If he wasn't, he would be telling you that it doesn't matter what they said, he doesn't feel that way and agree with you and be fine with them being out of Thanksgiving.

If talking it out isn\u2019t going to sway hearts, and might give you an aneurysm (it would me) \u2014 then just skip it.\n\nYou know what ruins Thanksgiving for an infant?
