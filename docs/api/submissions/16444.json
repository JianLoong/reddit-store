You shouldn\u2019t have expected them to throw you a party if your birthday was a month ago. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for them to not think you\u2019d be interested now. You should have just said, \u201chey when I come home can we celebrate my birthday since we weren\u2019t able to on the actual day?\u201d  However, this should not have been an argument.

Many years later my husband and I were staying with my mom for a few months as we had just moved to the state and were trying to find our own place - the time we were there happened to span both his and my birthday.\n\n\nFor his birthday my mom went all out, got him three or four gifts along the lines of his interests (games he likes), and had a birthday dinner for him.\n\n\nThe next month for my birthday (I wasn't expecting anything since I hadn't celebrated a birthday with my family in many years) I got a set of tupperware \"for the new house.\"", "I'm so petty I would do that or give them to a person on the street who needs them more or better yet donate them to a shelter. \nHowever, if I was in OP situation I wouldn't complain or say anything.

Her parents suck but she also very much sucks.", "Seriously, I\u2019m surprised at the comments here.

That makes a very big difference. I'm living far from home and only go back once in a while, I certainly didn't expect my parents to throw me birthday parties everytime like they did with my younger brother who's living with them.  \n\nAlso OP didn't mention how many time had passed between her birthday and the day she comes home. I mean if it's half a year already then it's normal that her parents are baffled by her request. \n*Edit : Ok I reread the post and it's actually said that it's one month later. Still, that's quite a long time and it's kinda out of the norm to expect or request a birthday party. Without prior pattern of them favorising the brother, OP attitude in this single incident sounds a bit like an AH.", "its a cake dingus not a five course meal", "> Also, it is not really your parent\u2019s job to make you happy. Happiness is free & it\u2019s all around you. \n\nThis is such a weird comment to me \u2014 it is the job of all human beings to be kind to each other... which in the case of parents involves not treating one child like they are cherished, and the other like they're not.\n\nYou could say this to anyone who's the recipient of shitty behavior (\"So your husband ignored you on your anniversary? It's not his job to make you happy \u2014 make yourself happy!\"), but we live in relationships and communities... it's bizarre to think that people shouldn't be affected by how others treat them.\n\nBecause the fact is, you DO have an obligation \u2014 to your friends, to your partner, to your family, to anyone you're in an intentional and close relationship with \u2014 to be supportive and kind and loving... or at the very least, to not make them feel like you don't value them.\n\n> I\u2019m confused ... if you haven\u2019t received a gift from your parents since you were 11 then why did you expect them to throw you a party this year?\n\nWhat I gathered from OP's comments is that her parents haven't really celebrated either her or her brother's birthday since they were kids (though they did give gifts, usually to her brother, sometimes (?) to her) \u2014 but this year, they did something different when they threw her brother a surprise party. So it was that surprise party that created the expectation \u2014 that, and her actually requesting a celebration, which it sounds like she hadn't done in past years.\n\nMaybe OP should have expected them to be shitty based on their past behavior, but she wasn't wrong to hope for a little equity. It feels like this is just the latest, and most glaring, example of how her parents treat her and her brother differently.", "NTA and people acting like it\u2019s just about the birthday really lack nuance.", "The best part is that they'll expect you two to be there when the \"good kid\" doesn't give them what they want.\n\nOnly to find out they screwed up big time.", "I\u2019ve just learned to treat the double standard as a joke.
