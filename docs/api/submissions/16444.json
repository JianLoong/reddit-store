That seems silly. Everyone, regardless of gender, should be celebrated on their birthday. As adults, the need for a \u201cbirth week/month\u201d is stupid (and I do know some stupid adults who pull that BS). But asking your family to acknowledge you with a nice meal and a chorus of happy birthday to express their care for you isn\u2019t out of line.\n\nThe parents should be celebrating both their kids equally.", "I bet the OP has known she isn't the golden child for years.", "Never ask for anything from parents like this. You\u2019re just setting yourself up for disappointment.  My mother (if I had ever asked) would say \u201cBut gift cards are so impersonal!\u201d And you can\u2019t get them on the bargain rack or bin. \n\nNever got a thing that fit or was even remotely nice or cute after I was 10 - but beware on her birthday, she would expect great gifts. She\u2019d  say \u201cOh you spent too much!\u201d \u201cThis is too much!\u201d. But if you spent modestly (which I did), she would talk to the other kids and her husband about what a \u201cdisappointing\u201d or \u201cimpersonal\u201d gift it was.

I was about 16 and found it VERY funny.", "No, I\u2019d say that their parent\u2019s favouritism towards their son is clearly patterned behaviour that started when OP was still a child.

You had to literally beg and get in a fight before your mother caved and was like, \"*whiny voice* Fine. I'll make you a stupid cake.\" As OP said, her parents planned a whole party for her brother. Custom cake, decorations, and close family. Yes, OP's birthday was a month gone at the point of being home, but clearly, there wasn't a way to be home for her birthday as she was at college. Her parents very easily could've sent her a gift to her dorm or planned something simple yet special. But OP had to beg her parents. OP, you are 1000% NTA.

A month after your birthday. \n\nI mean you can't have expected to one up your brother's premeditated surprise party when you came home and asked for a birthday on the spot rather than asking for one in advance.\n\nAsking in advance is key here. Nobody knew you where gonna ask them to pull a lavish party out their asses for you if they had no idea you where hung up on it an entire month later.\n\nYour emphasising that there's favoritism without considering you just had bad timing.\n\nImagine everything being awkward and they hated that they strung together a bland party cause you where so persistent and you got a bland party cause you pushed and they couldn't even plan you a party on their own terms. You made it uncomfortable. \n\nI personally wouldn't have wanted them to bother.", "Well, I guess we know who the favorite child is and it is not you. Sorry.
