I wish my parents had taken more pics.\n\nParents today have gone in the complete opposite directions. Their kids are going to have hard drives full of more pics and videos than they could ever want or need. IMO, your wife is actually *subtracting* from the value of these pics and videos by taking too many.

That would still leave plenty of memories.", "So important if they're posted or they're just preserved as family memories. Sure, you can still say no if they're just for personal viewing but... why? It's selfish. If the only people looking at them are people who are just happy to see you, yeah sorry you don't like being on camera but your kids might like seeing you when you're dead. Personal experience. I hate getting my picture taken but my goddaughter who I hadn't seen in a long time because of the pandemic asked me to send a pic. I did. I asked her to not post it. She says she didn't and I believe her. She just wanted a picture of me. Me, her very alive godmother who hasn't been a super big force in her life since she was little and we had to move away from each other. It's important to know what's happening with the pics.", "I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your sister. While I acknowledge that the pictures and videos are going to be a great way for the kids to remember OP, I don\u2019t think that means Mom needs to be filming every moment. If she does once a month, that\u2019s still 12 videos a year. I think based on OPs post, it sounds like Mom is truly filming an excessive amount and it\u2019s ok for OP to push back on that, even if it\u2019s for memories for the kids.", "Sorry how is that the same?\n\nOne person: records happy moments that *the children* may very well enjoy later in life (I'm really glad I have videos of me and my mom who died very young)\n\nOther person: records first person having a bad time that is only watchable of someone is begging mean\n\nFrankly I have no judgment and feel for OP here because I hate getting pictures taken, but your solution isn't the least bit evening anything out or similar at all. It's also not an \"info.\" You can just make a suggestion.", "Even if they\u2019re not he has every right to say that sometimes he just wants to be with his kids without thinking about how it\u2019ll look on the video. Not everyone likes being filmed. OP doesn\u2019t. His wife should respect that.", "To me personally, if he doesn\u2019t want to be videoed then he shouldn\u2019t have to be filmed. However\u2026.yes it does make a difference in that it might open OP\u2019s mind to a different perspective. Not to force him to be filmed but he may allow himself to be filmed more or talk it out with the spouse about what life events would be okay to film. Or he could stand firm on not being filmed. I have a feeling OP may not have thought of that perspective of these videos or photos being used in the future, and might be more understanding when communicating with his spouse is all. \n\nI have a feeling more posts are going to showcase how much videos and photos of silly moments have gotten people through grief.", "I don\u2019t disagree, but to play devils advocate, if Mom participated as opposed to filming they could all be making memories as a family. A few videos and pictures are great but it would also be nice for a family to just enjoy each other and not have a lens separating one family member from the group.", "He has the right to but he is the asshole for exercising it", "Yeah, this doesn't work after a few years roll by. \n\nI used to be very critical of my wife recording random things of me and kids, and would ask her to join instead of recording, and when she did, we didn't have recordings.\n\nToday, when the kids ask about their younger days, it's just me with them, very few are with her. And of course the kids don't remember. I wish I had gotten off my high horse and recorded a few more times of her with the kids.", "Can you tell my husband? I have what seems like an endless amount of photos/videos of him with our son and only a few with me. I really wish it was something he thought about more.", "This is aita, not \"do I have the right to do what I did\". You can be within your rights, and still TA.", "You keep saying \u201che has the right\u201d, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s actually true. Most states, you can record whoever you want. Hence paparazzi exists and can take pictures through your windows as long as they\u2019re not physically on the property. The subject doesn\u2019t have to like it, and 10 times out of 10, the result is way better if they *dont* like it. Either way, I don\u2019t think he has any right to not be recorded.", "You can tell your hubby this real life example. Thank goodness my parents would take pics and videos with each other interacting with me and my sibling. It was more \u201coooh cute moment with Mom let\u2019s get this on film\u201d and vice versa. My mother died when I was 10 and those videos of her got me through my grief as a child. It honestly helped the whole family. \n\nIf my dad wouldn\u2019t have done that\u2026..guaranteed he would have regretted the rest of his life he never got more photos or videos to celebrate who she was. And would have been confronted by the fact when his kids would be grieving and craving those remaining remnants of their mother\u2026\u2026that he had very little to show if she was the one mainly behind the camera. A real life thought for your hubby if that helps.", "So he\u2019s an asshole for having boundaries? Not enjoying being videoed doesn\u2019t make him an asshole. People didn\u2019t video every moment 50 years ago and those kids seemed to survive without it.", "I believe what you\u2019re referring to is a reasonable expectation of privacy. You\u2019re correct, in public no one has a reasonable expectation of privacy and can be recorded. However, he\u2019s in his own home where he DOES have a reasonable expectation of privacy.", "I think this situation requires more information to judge. Are the videos being posted to social media, or kept for private memories? How often are videos happening? I think there's plenty of room for reasonable compromise here, and if either party is unwilling to give at all, then they are TA.", "He is the asshole for not meeting his wife have way if they aren\u2019t being posted publicly.  Having a no photos or video policy is an asshole boundary when raising a family.", "I just disagree. I don\u2019t think that refusing to be filmed during moments with his children is an AH move regardless of if they are being posted or not. He\u2019s clearly uncomfortable with it and in turn is likely focusing on that instead of being able to enjoy those moments. I feel it\u2019s more important for him to be able to fully enjoy the moment with his kids than for a video to exist of that moment only now it\u2019s not as happy of a memory for him.", "I think it\u2019s sweet that she records those moments,  it so sweet if she is posting them on social media without your consent.", "NTA - esp if it goes online but even then how about living in the moment", "Look,  I get it.   My mom and I both hate getting our pictures taken.  I'm also 38, so taking pictures of everything wasn't as common when I was younger.   My mom's house burned down 6 weeks ago and I could have easily lost her.   It really made me realize how few pictures I have with her.   I wish I had some of me as a child as well,  but we never really took any. \n\nSet some boundaries with your wife,  like she can take pics for a set time while doing an activity,  then needs to live in the moment.   I have a feeling later in life you might regret it if you don't have pics of these fleeting moments,  and she might regret living through a camera lens. \n\nSide note.   My mom is fine.   She's a badass that kicked out a window to escape.   She's living with me and my family until her house is rebuilt.", "NTA. Recording people requires all adults present to agree, and the parents of any children being recorded. She doesn't have that.", "Even if they\u2019re just for her, she still needs his consent, or else she\u2019s being intrusive and rude.", "I only have about 20 photos of my late mother, and it devastates me. But there\u2019s a middle ground between a photo once a year and filming videos every time the kids play. Limits are fine. Saying no sometimes is fine. Not everything needs to be on video.", "A lot of people feel self conscious when being recorded, and wouldn\u2019t want to feel that way all the time.", "I don't think it's \"no pictures and videos\" more no unexpected candid videos when you aren't ready for it. To me there is a big difference to say filming at a birthday party, or filming when you just got home from work. One is a sure, the other us definitely a please don't."]}
