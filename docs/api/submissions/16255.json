This feels invasive to me. I don't like pics/vids of myself either, so I may be projecting. I'd say these moments might be of great sentimental value later - either to you or the kids. Or both. I'd for sure draw the line at them being posted on social media.", "INFO - Does she post the videos on social media or are they just for her and the kids/family?", "NTA\n\nYou don\u2019t like it and you both need to come to an agreement. Maybe she records and doesn\u2019t post anything. Maybe she\u2019s recording because she doesn\u2019t have memories of her family?\n\nJust talk it out and come to a compromise.", "Info:  is she sharing these videos or just keeping them for yourselves?", "NTA, mostly, because I hate that crap too. I just want to enjoy the time and the moment.\n\nThat said, if she is not sharing the videos and just saving them for the kids, it might be worth sucking it up and letting her. My dad passed away last June and I think I would kill for a video like you are describing with him and me as a child.", "NTA. Absolute basic recording etiquette. If anybody being recorded is not okay with being recorded, don't. She's flagrantly disregarding a boundary you're putting up and showing a massive amount of disrespect in the process. \n\nTip: hide one of those little water guns on your person in flipping her off doesn't work. You can also carry a little portable strobe light with you to ruin the recording itself.", "NTA. It\u2019s incredibly rude for her to continue recording you after you asked her to stop.", "Ok so, you're NTA, BUT..\n\nI can understand thst you don't want any of this posted on social media, and she absolutely shouldn't post anything of your or the kids without explicit consent.\n\nThat being said, you're going to be gone one day, and your kids are going to want pictures and videos of you together.\nI take lots of pics and videos of my partner with our kids (also never post without asking and getting approval), and quite frankly I wish he'd return the favour. Because the kids will have a gazillion of photos and videos of them and their dad and none of me.\n\nJust food for thought, OP.", "Not going to give a verdict.  I\u2019m here to suggest that you take videos of her playing with the kids. Obviously this is something important to her - keeping memories.  I get it\u2019s annoying to be recorded, and you can work on that together.  But.  Does she have ANY videos of herself with her kids?  If she were gone tomorrow, would they have physical memories of her to keep?", "OP, your kids don't get a choice when it comes to your wife videoing them and putting it on social media. YOU need to make that choice for them. Tell her they are not to be on social media. If she wants to put herself and herself only on social media, so be it. But you and the kids don't want to be \"on display for likes\" because she thinks it's \"cute\".", "NTA. Folks who want to record every moment instead of actually being in the moment and present are sad to me. Also she shouldn\u2019t be posting the kids online either. They might not appreciate it when they are older.", "INFO: Is she posting these videos to social media for clout? Or just saving them for posterity? \n\nY T A if she's trying to take videos for your kids to have later. My sister passed away abruptly a year ago and her 5 year old son will only have the videos we've taken of her to remember her by. \n\nN T A if she's posting them all over Facebook for clout.", "NTA. This is body autonomy.", "NTA.  She has an unhealthy attachment to her phone.  She seems to be so busy filming things, she isn't living them - just looking at them through a tiny screen.  If you don't want to be filmed, then she should respect that and stop it.", "NTA, but you may regret not having any videos of you with your kids at this age. But it is your decision. I think recording is fine as long as they arent posting it on their social media. Thats when I would consider it invasive.", "NTA for not wanting to be filmed for social media purposes but YTA if your wife is making recordings to keep for when the kids are older.", "NTA maybe you can compromise by making home videos that won\u2019t be posted anywhere when there\u2019s a special occasion.

You're not a Hollywood actor", "NTA.  My wife hates having her picture taken.  I don't understand it, but I don't push the issue, either.  Sometimes I tease her about it but that's as far as it goes.  If it makes you uncomfortable, it's NOT okay, even if she is your spouse.  She needs to back off and consider your feelings.", "NTA: Social media isn't for the kids or posterity.

You have a right to parent and bond with your kids without it being recorded.", "ESH.  Your wife should have gotten permission first, but I've got to say, my mom hated the camera, and I only have two recordings of her.  Both are hugely important to me because I get to hear her voice.   I would give anything to have a video of her playing with me as a kid.  She died when I was 21. The occasional video for your kids isn't a big ask.  Although she doesn't need to share them online.", "YTA If you died tomorrow, your kids would be grateful to have videos of themselves with you.", "NTA. I don't understand parents who want to record everything.  They are not in the moment with their families.  And then they watched their kids grow up through a tiny lens instead of in the context of the larger scene.  My husband was all about videos of everything until I pointed this out. \n\nIt sounds like the problem is that she wants to video you all the time.  I bet if it was just a rare occurrence, you wouldn't mind so much.", "NTA. It\u2019s not for the kids. It\u2019s so she can get likes and accolades", "Lol my mom fr fr", "NTA. A quick discreet photo here and there is fine, and you're going to want them later in life. But prolonged photography or recordings would make me incredibly self-conscious and completely take me out of the moment and ruin the experience.", "NTA, Sorry but why the F do people want to keep shoving their kids out on social media.  Yes, send some things to the grandparents and the like. But your kids are not going to make you an \"A\" lister by pimping every waking moment of their lives online.", "NTA. I have a hard time focusing on what I am doing when I\u2019m being recorded. If I\u2019m engaging with my kid, I want to be fully present, so I would ask the same. Maybe a \u2018compromise\u2019 is to offer to record her more. But you are right to not want to be recorded, and flipping off the camera is a reasonable prevention.", "ESH. You could have politely told her that you'd prefer if all of your moments didn't go public, or you'd have more fun as a family if she could enjoy the moment and not always record everything. You'll be happy when she has those recordings in the future! But not everything needs to go up on social media.", "NTA. If you say you don't want to be recorded, then your wife shouldn't be recording you, and you with your kids. And ESPECIALLY if it might end up on social media.  \nDon't fight at length with her about it if she won't respect you. But by all means, make whatever gesture or facial expression you need to to make the recording unpostable. Sometimes it just requires consistent negative reinforcement to put a stop to something like that. Just be prepared to do this as long as you need to.", "ESH. You\u2019re both being childish. Why don\u2019t you just set some ground rules? You don\u2019t want to be filmed unless you say you want to be filmed. That\u2019s all it takes.", "Honestly to me it just seems like you don't want social media to know you're a loving family", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

When I go through photo albums of my childhood, they skip around between big periods of time. Which sucks. I wish my parents had taken more pics.\n\nParents today have gone in the complete opposite directions. Their kids are going to have hard drives full of more pics and videos than they could ever want or need. IMO, your wife is actually *subtracting* from the value of these pics and videos by taking too many. Sort of like the way nobody gives a damn about fireworks anymore because they happen every other day at every local event. \n\nIf she wants these pics and vids to be special, she needs to cut back. IMO, of course.", "There is a difference between some photos and every when interaction and natural behavior becomes a photo op. It makes it stilted and changes it for some people.

I am so grateful now that I'm older and have had dear family members pass away for some documentation of those precious family moments.\n\nI hope that OP and his wife can come to an agreement. Social media sucks (I'm aware of the hypocrisy as I'm typing a Reddit comment), but capturing memories now can lead to such great family bonding in the future; it is so lovely sitting with my parents and asking them about certain pictures or family members that I don't recognize anymore. I also hope that OP will occasionally step behind the camera to capture moments of his wife and kids since the usual photographer (in this case, mom) is usually left out of the pictures and videos.", "I'm just super self-conscious and start thinking too much.

My mom especially is such a documenter and I hated hated hated it growing up. Some of the most miserable moments we had as a family stemmed from fights that started with me hating photos or refusing to be in them - my parents never shared these photos either . It was just something they kept and hold on to. Looking back i truly regret  my actions and what a brat I was. And I'm so so thankful that my mom was the hoarder of digital photo and video content she was. I even subconsciously started doing it too - still hate photos of myself but take a lot of photos and videos  of other people and places and scenery and things. All of these are precious as people pass away but also for those that have drifted away and out of my life for any number of growing up reasons and all.", "I\u2019m the opposite. I hated photos as a kid, and now I feel no attachment to most of the pictures. I look upset in a lot of them, and I remember the arguments leading up to a few. It\u2019s nice to be able to show people photos from my childhood if the occasion comes up, but the amount I have isn\u2019t necessary. \n\nMy mom got a digital camera when I was in elementary school so there are a combination of digital photos and physical photos. The physical photos mostly sit untouched in my parents garage except for a few on the walls. I think my mom has the digital photos but I\u2019m not sure if they even made it when she replaced her computers.", "Actually, it's shitty that his wife is more concerned about video tapping every single event than enjoying the moment.\n\n\nAlso, it sounds like she posts these videos to social media. Do you have any idea of the consequences of that?\n\n\nOp nta. She needs to shove her camera up her tush.", "The kids might be bummed later on but that\u2019s OPs problem to address. OP has the right to not be filmed regardless of what anyone else thinks of that."]}
