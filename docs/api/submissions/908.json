This is fantastic since I will be staying at their place and it's not in the city and public transportation is not available in their area.\nHere's my delima: they did not tell me that we were watching the kids until 1 week before they leave. My manager just so happens to be out of the office for the same week I'm watching the kids. Because of this,I cannot make adjustments to my schedule. The one child has to be at school at 6am (long before the school busses start running) for an advanced band he's in. I cannot reasonably take him to this practice and get to work on time. WIBTA if I told them he has to miss that week of practice or they have to find him other transportation to school on those days?\n\nEdit for clarity: I feel like I might be the asshole because I am agreeing to take care of these kids while their parents are away but am refusing to take him to an advanced band practice that he work hard to get into. Is it wrong to say he can't go while under my care because I don't want to be late for work? I'm the assistant manager so since my manager is gone for the week I cannot adjust my schedule.

I'm worried that him missing a week will have a negative impact on his status in the band or his mental health. I also feel like since I'm agreeing to watch the kids for the week that it may also come with the implications of being expected to do everything the parents do, especially since they are leaving us their car.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He may be able to find another arrangement to get to school or speak with his band leader. You would be an A if you weren\u2019t upfront about your limitation.", "\" Here's my delima: they did not tell me that we were watching the kids until 1 week before they leave.\"  It was an emergency  not something most people plan out months in advance. \n\nThis just really have you talked with your friends, explained that while you can stay with the kids, you would not be able to get them to band  that early in the morning,  are their other parents of fellow band kids that could pick them up to take them to school for the week ? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNAH,", "NTA\n\nYou\u2019re doing them a favor in a time of emergency.  It\u2019s unreasonable of them to expect you to go above-and-beyond, especially at risk of detriment to your own career.\n\nMissing a week of practice ain\u2019t gonna ruin kids life.  What does he do when they have family vacations?", "NAH the kid won't fail his music class if he misses one session. It's just unfortunate that your schedules clash", "NAH. You are doing them a favour and can't put your job at risk. Your job takes priority over a kid's music class. Maybe the parents can contact the parents of another child who is in the band and they can pick him up that week.", "WNBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYOu agreed to take care of them as an emergency measure. So it is fine to drop that course for that duration. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIF they don't agree, their emergency is not that big, let them find someone else.", "NAH \n\nyou are doing a favour, they can't expect you to drop everything and acoomodate at such short notice. Just be open and honest about what you and can't do so there's no confusion/miscommunication which will lead to bigger problemms.", "NAH. You're doing your friends a favor by watching the kids as best you can with your schedule. If the band practise were essential they should have made sure it worked for you before picking you to watch the kids, or made other transportation arrangements to get the child there on time.", "NTA to talk to them about it.  It is just one week.  Also, the parents or the student might know someone nearby taking their student at that early hour that would be willing to give him a ride for 1 week.", "INFO\n\nCan your husband take the child?", "NAH - but I would talk to the kid and see if he has any friends in the class whose parents may be willing to do him a solid for the week. You could even offer to help cover their gas (assuming that\u2019s not cost prohibitive) if they have to come out of their way, or drop him off at their place on your way to work. If not, I would ask the parents to get in touch with the school so he can be excused for the week and it won\u2019t count against him.", "Doesn\u2019t the child have friends to ride with? Have the parents talk to the band director and let them know it\u2019s a family emergency. They should have let you know about the early practice, especially since it impacts your ability to get to work on time.", "Completely agree with the NAH.\n\nGiven this isn't a planned issue, but an emergency, there's a lot of leeway on both sides. OP is doing a HUGE favor as it is, but OP cannot drop everything to accommodate. That's perfectly fine. If the kids have to miss some normal activities, that's a result of the emergency, not a lack of caring/effort on OP's end.\n\nOP should absolutely communicate to the friends what they can/can't do. I'd have to assume the friends will fully understand (if they do not understand and make things difficult, OP would not be TA for backing out).", "That's the solution I'm pushing for but if it doesn't work out I'll feel kinda guilty.", "Unfortunately not, he doesn't have a driver's license and I would need the car to get to work every morning.", "I know... you hate for him to miss practice.  Talk to the parents.  Are they paying you or is this 100% favor?  If they are paying you, they may expect a bit more.  Lastly, not sure how far it is, but uber is an option, also.", "Don\u2019t feel guilty. Looking after the kids for a week\n while going to work is favour enough. The parents have to find a solution to this, not you.", "Well if the parents are still in town, talk to them at once tell them the problem.  Perhaps they know someone who can give him a ride.  If they aren't.  You call the school & you talk to the band director & explain the situation.", "You're not near FT Worth TX are you?"]}
