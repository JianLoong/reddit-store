We have our ups and downs, as with every relationship. We can both become highly emotional - with me dysregulated/crying and him dysregulated/yelling. It's not always the best, but we typically have great communication when we are calm and take the time to sit down after, process the incident, share feelings, communicate our concerns, and create plans to move forward. We are deeply passionate for each other and are quite in love.\n\nOn NYE, I accidentally burned my breast with a sparkler. A pretty good size burn, 2nd degree. He bandaged me up (he was an army medic) and has been taking good care of helping me take care of it and re-bandaging it for me, etc.\n\nTonight we were sitting together, chill, no issues, having a good night. He recently bought smelling salts and thought it would be funny to try to make me smell it (or at least, tease me about it and pretend to do it). In the process of lunging towards me in jest to try to make me smell it, he completely fucked around and tore off my healing scab (I didn't have it covered for a moment as I was letting it air out after I had a shower). Needless to say, I got pretty upset and began to cry. In the moment, all I could think about is how much it physically hurt, how shocked I was that it happened, how frustrated and upset that I was about how careless he was to do that, and worried about scarring.\n\nHe immediately apologized and said he didn't mean to. He went to get the bandages to redo it.\n\nI was still crying after a couple minutes.\n\nApparently this was a couple minutes too long. He became hostile and began to yell at me to stop crying and that I was acting like a baby. He raised his voice and screamed at me.\n\nAgain, this took place in 3 minutes top. I was not crying for hours or something ridiculous. Maybe for 3-4 minutes.\n\nI became extremely upset for him yelling at me, so I went silent and ignored him for a bit. After, he said again that he was sorry for what happened and that he said he was sorry, but I was acting like a child crying for so long, and we all know what it feels like to have a scab ripped off, and I was being dramatic. I said that I was allowed to feel my feelings (all the ones listed above I explained to him - nervous, physically hurt, worried, etc.). He then got annoyed and basically said fuck you. And I said it's crazy how \\*I\\* am the one who got hurt and yet I'm the one being yelled at like I did something wrong. And I didn't even yell at him for what he did! I just cried for a measly 3 minutes.\n\nNow we are sitting in silent anger.\n\nMaybe I'm the asshole because in the end, he was probably just angry with himself about hurting me, and the crying that I was doing was making him feel more guilty.\n\n I don't know Reddit, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1704766900, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1923enk/aita_for_crying_for_too_long_after_my_boyfriend/", "score": 23, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you're in pain, you have every right to cry, and he shouldn't be angry.\n\nIt seems like a toxic attitude from your boyfriend to try to control your emotions so he doesn't feel bad about accidentally hurting you, and making you feel guilty is even worse.\n\nAlso, \"dysregulated yelling\" what they hell is that?Is it an excuse to yell at you, treat you poorly, and not take responsibility for it?", "NTA, and a red flag. You mention that you cry and he yells, as if they are equivalent. They are not. \n\nIf my partner yelled \u201cfuck you\u201d at me for saying I am allowed to cry after she hurt me, I would be livid (to put it mildly), not sitting there wondering if perhaps I am the AH.\n\nThere are abusive patterns in this relationship and story. Take care, and consider whether this is the life you want.", "NTA - Nope, the way he reacted was unacceptable. He hurt you and doesn\u2019t get to dictate the consequences of his own stupid actions. He tried to force smelling salts on you (whether in jest or not, doesn\u2019t matter), and in doing so he ripped off your scab. Which, yeah. HURTS.\n\nThen he berated you for crying about it? Yelled and screamed? Called you names and swore at you? Nah, ma\u2019am. That\u2019s a lot more than \u201cdysregulated\u201d and if *that* is his reaction to accidentally hurting you, then something seriously needs to change and he needs to be willing to make those changes.\n\nIf he can\u2019t handle his own guilt for accidentally hurting you and it causes him to lash out, or if he\u2019s so uncomfortable by your being open with your feelings that he feels a need to scream you into submission, he should be working that out with a professional. Because that speaks to some deep anger or regulatory issues that he has refused to work out.\n\nHaving anger or regulatory issues doesn\u2019t make someone an AH. But your boyfriend is an AH for knowingly having these issues and not changing his behavior in a meaningful way by getting himself into therapy to deal with this. He shouldn\u2019t be comfortable knowing he\u2019s this capable of hurting you.\n\nNo amount of issues he claims to have justifies him screaming at you like this. *Ever.*", "NTA - Wow, you are only allowed to cry for 3 minutes? I can't imagine how this guy will handle a crying baby. This is a big red flag - tread carefully.", "NTA, and you need to get as far away from this loser as possible. If he pops off like that because you cry when you get hurt, it\u2019s possible he\u2019ll go farther at one point.", "he\u2019s abusive", "NTA - \n\nYou made it clear you knew it was a mistake. You were still hurt and emotional, he clearly felt guilty or like because he said sorry you couldn\u2019t be upset anymore. \n\nIt\u2019s weird. Couples therapy, or break up would be my next steps.", "NTA-You reacted in a completely normal way to getting a scab ripped off. He reacted like an asshole.", "nta youre allowed to cry about things no matter how small they seem to other people. there is no \"time limit\" to crying. you cant cry for \"too long\". what your boyfriend did is a red flag. he is trying to control you in a violent way. you have to talk this out with him and make sure he doesnt do it again.", "NTA people who truly feel that guilty would go out of their way to not make the guilt they are feeling the highlight of the situation. They would apologize profusely and keep it to themselves as they wait/help you recover. Very reminiscent of parenting yelling at their kids to stop crying after they made the kids cry\u2026", "Your boyfriend is abusive. \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nYo\u2019re emotionally \u201cdisregulated\u201d and constantly crying because your boyfriend is emotionally unstable and verbally abusive. The \u201cpassion\u201d  and \u201cups and downs\u201d you describe is really just the cycle of abuse: calm \u2014> tension building \u2014-> explosive behavior \u2014> reconciliation (passion). Recycle. Repeat. \n\nI\u2019m sure after this incident your boyfriend will do some grand gesture to win you back or have a deep conversation about his \u201cfeelings\u201d, and the cycle will continue.", "How are you burning your titties with a sparkler?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Some of us cry more than others. However his reaction is pretty bonkers. I could see him being a little annoyed, but a full man tantrum is weird AF. It seems like he got defensive and assumes your crying meant you thought he did it on purpose, or that you were crying because of him, and although misguided, I could understand being a little grumpy in the moment, but calming down immediately with clarification. Any other reaction seems bonkers to me. NTA", "NTA\n\nCrying for 3 full minutes is concerning from a medical perspective. You may want to have that burn checked if it hurt that bad. \n\nYou're in a bad relationship. Period.

Yelling and berating shouldn\u2019t even be in the realm of possible actions to take. Please do yourself a favour and leave this relationship.

Also wtf is wrong with him, you're in pain, of course you cried for a while that shit hurts. His lack of empathy and thinking you can just switch off the crying when it's convenient is shitty and concerning.

Maybe instead of putting labels on things and accepting life as it is, you could work on correcting your emotional issues?\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely not normal for him to scream at you for \u2018crying too long\u2019.

No, maybe everyone wouldn't cry but it's absolutely normal to cry for other reasons besides physical pain.", "Well, unless I'm thinking of something else, it's just a little stick with some magnesium and stuff that's designed to sparkle when combusted. \n\nFor me it'd be the same thing if someone burt a tit on a cast iron pan.
