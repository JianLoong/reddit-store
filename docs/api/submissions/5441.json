Did she give you nice presents on previous years? Maybe you can have a chat with her, tell her that the gift she gave you seems not as nice as she gave you before, tell her it made you feel hurt and ask if she's cross at you for something. That's if you want to be diplomatic... Otherwise you can just bring this up and complain.  \nNone of the gifts sound precious or well-thought out, according to your description. So kinda makes sense to return them. OTOH on principle it's still nicer to ask the person who gave the gift, if they would mind if you return the gift, you appreciate the thought, but the gift doesn't really suit you and you don't want to collect stuff on the shelf which will just gather dust and end up in a landfill, better someone else gets it and you can get some money to buy something you want.", "  I think her \"gifts from her girls\" schtick was her attempt to cover the REAL reason: she wants to spend HER money on things for her family. \n\n   THIS is exactly why I don't like the gift exchange thing among people who *can* afford it.
