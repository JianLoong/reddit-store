And even if she got you a great gift that you didn\u2019t like or couldn\u2019t use, returning or regifting is totally fine.\n\nPeople get touchy about it but things are not a reflection of a gift giver\u2019s value. Gifts (unless homemade) are just items and most people have way too many things. Holding onto tchotchkes is pointless. Your cousin is just creating drama. Your aunt didn\u2019t even try.

But why tell them?", "NTA. So the aunt is the one giving you that unexpectedly poor gift, and the cousin who is not related to this gift is the one calling you AH? The cousing doesn't have a stake in this situation, she's just saying that on the principle that returning gifts is not cool?   \nThe aunt did something rather strange, did you piss her off in some way? Did she give you nice presents on previous years? Maybe you can have a chat with her, tell her that the gift she gave you seems not as nice as she gave you before, tell her it made you feel hurt and ask if she's cross at you for something. That's if you want to be diplomatic... Otherwise you can just bring this up and complain.  \nNone of the gifts sound precious or well-thought out, according to your description. So kinda makes sense to return them. OTOH on principle it's still nicer to ask the person who gave the gift, if they would mind if you return the gift, you appreciate the thought, but the gift doesn't really suit you and you don't want to collect stuff on the shelf which will just gather dust and end up in a landfill, better someone else gets it and you can get some money to buy something you want.", "  I think her \"gifts from her girls\" schtick was her attempt to cover the REAL reason: she wants to spend HER money on things for her family. \n\n   THIS is exactly why I don't like the gift exchange thing among people who *can* afford it.

Returning a gift you can't use is not mean. There's way too much crap on this planet. The problem is talking about it to another family member. Yeah, it was not super nice for auntie to cheap out on you if your family usually does gifts more generously. And that's a little depressing. \n\nBut nobody is owed a gift, and being sullen about it to other family members doesn't help, does it?

It\u2019s one thing if she wanted to let her kids pick out a few gifts but she should\u2019ve got something else that would actually be within the limit. It is not OK. She only spent $17.
