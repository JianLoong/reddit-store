Did she give you nice presents on previous years? Maybe you can have a chat with her, tell her that the gift she gave you seems not as nice as she gave you before, tell her it made you feel hurt and ask if she's cross at you for something. That's if you want to be diplomatic... Otherwise you can just bring this up and complain.  \nNone of the gifts sound precious or well-thought out, according to your description. So kinda makes sense to return them. OTOH on principle it's still nicer to ask the person who gave the gift, if they would mind if you return the gift, you appreciate the thought, but the gift doesn't really suit you and you don't want to collect stuff on the shelf which will just gather dust and end up in a landfill, better someone else gets it and you can get some money to buy something you want.", "  I think her \"gifts from her girls\" schtick was her attempt to cover the REAL reason: she wants to spend HER money on things for her family. \n\n   THIS is exactly why I don't like the gift exchange thing among people who *can* afford it.

So she had plenty of time", "Lol she\u2019s super cheap", "Tell her that the store messed up and the gift\nCard was for $17 instead of the $200+ it should have been.", "THIS is why I don't participate in Christmas nonsense anymore. I always get people thoughtful gifts they actually want and I'm ab afterthought. One time I was given a laundry hamper, next year was a gift card to the grocery store. That one really stung \"oh crap I forgot their gift, here I'm buying groceries anyways ill just then a gift card to this store I'm at.\" the first year I did the gift exchange with my partners family I got nothing while everyone got multiple gifts. Husband had lost his job that year and things were tight so he told them we weren't going to be doing a gift exchange. I didn't care so much that I got nothing because I was kind of used to getting shitty gifts anyways but seeing everyone had the money to spend so much on each other it was kinda rude they all ignored their brother and gave him nothing aswell. We gave them all gifts next year and next few years but they continued to give us nothing except his parents. We tapped out.", "Regift the whistle, play make up, a chipped coffee mug, and a used Walmart gift card to her kids and let\u2019s see how \u201cprecious\u201d she thinks it is.", "They're definitely too old to pick out the crap OP was gifted. A fucking WHISTLE?!? Girl, bye.", "Ok question, just to play devil's advocate here. Is it possible that she intended for the gift card to be $250 (minus the gifts from the kids) and the cashier accidentally typed in $25? Could this be a mistake/misunderstanding?", "Hahaha that\u2019s brilliant. Cousin would do a 180 for sure.", "Exactly! Gifts are a generous thing that shouldn\u2019t come with expectations. I regularly remind the people I give gifts to, that they can return it or give it away but it\u2019s theirs to do with as they want. It\u2019s theirs, not mine. Gift giving culture is so intense.", "exactly what im talking about u know what they say...a picture is worth a thousand words lol", "What\u2019s next!? Macaroni necklaces and drawings of their favorite anime characters?? Lol!", "What has your mum had to say about this whole fiasco?", "Hand the whistle to the kids who picked out your stupid gifts and ply them with Shirley Temples all night.", "How hard is it to say \"I won't be doing the secret Santa this year\" You don't even have to give a reason. You don't just give someone a couple pieces of crap instead", "Get her name next year!", "Nothing just \u201coh well it\u2019s the thought that counts\u201d", "Are you sure the gift card wasn\u2019t \u201cactivated\u201d or was it actually used? I have had this happen before. But you need to call her out on the $17.\n\nNTA", "I have to wonder if your Aunt is having financial issues and this was her way of hiding it?", "Blast photos of the gifts and the value of the Wal-Mart card on FB and let the public shame the cheapskate aunt.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking. And have to get the same exact stuff. When she opens it and gets mad, just say \u201cI thought you\u2019d love it. After all, that\u2019s what you gave me last year.\u201d", "If it's the thought that counts, then there wouldn't be a dollar range given to the participants.", "Did you open your gifts in front of everyone? Might be no need to put the aunt on blast like a lot of people are suggesting, the family already saw it even if they don't know who, they know someone isn't abiding by the terms.\n\nIs it already well known that aunt does this? Has she done this to people in the past?", "Either way you\u2019re obviously NTA, I\u2019m sure someone else would have a problem if the stipulations weren\u2019t followed. I\u2019m petty I would have made a bigger deal out of it than you have- maybe opt out next year why should you have to dig into your pockets that deep for basically someone\u2019s castaways- it\u2019d be one thing if they had financial issues and couldn\u2019t afford it but at least put thought into it- crocheted you a blanket, a custom mug with your favorited beverages in a gift basket would have been like 50$ but they didn\u2019t even do that it\u2019s bs"]}
