Sounds like your aunty was just being cheap!", "Honestly, NTA. Your aunt is an asshole for not living up to the secret santa agreement. \n\nIf it were me, I would have gone over-the-top grateful with everything. I would have worn the play makeup, drank only out of the cup at christmas and showed my brand new whistle to all others, so they know what's up... but I'm petty af.", "NTA. Her gift was thoughtless and she could have spent the $17 on an Amazon gift card.", "NTA and I'm guessing that the 17.31 was because she had a gift card and let the kids but some of those items on it. The rules were clear of 250-500 and shouldn't include crap. Sorry and I'd have done the same. Her next gift would be used dog toys.", "NTA. Your aunt seriously failed at secret Santa. And even if she got you a great gift that you didn\u2019t like or couldn\u2019t use, returning or regifting is totally fine.\n\nPeople get touchy about it but things are not a reflection of a gift giver\u2019s value. Gifts (unless homemade) are just items and most people have way too many things. Holding onto tchotchkes is pointless. Your cousin is just creating drama. Your aunt didn\u2019t even try. Don\u2019t feel bad.", "NTA. If you enter secret Santa you abide by the rules of it and yours clearly state the gift is btwn a certain price range. However I just wouldn't have told anyone. But yeah your aunt sucks. It's not cute it's cheap. She could've also easily supplemented the gift with an actual gift amongst all the other things her kids picked out.", "Questions-why did you have to tell her? \nAnd what was the repercussion for not following the budget?\n\nEither way I think NTA I think that she was out of line and should have been called out in the moment", "NTA - Tell your cousin you'll get the stuff back and trade the \"precious\" stuff for her AirPods.", "NTA.  But why tell them?", "NTA. So the aunt is the one giving you that unexpectedly poor gift, and the cousin who is not related to this gift is the one calling you AH? The cousing doesn't have a stake in this situation, she's just saying that on the principle that returning gifts is not cool?   \nThe aunt did something rather strange, did you piss her off in some way? Did she give you nice presents on previous years? Maybe you can have a chat with her, tell her that the gift she gave you seems not as nice as she gave you before, tell her it made you feel hurt and ask if she's cross at you for something. That's if you want to be diplomatic... Otherwise you can just bring this up and complain.  \nNone of the gifts sound precious or well-thought out, according to your description. So kinda makes sense to return them. OTOH on principle it's still nicer to ask the person who gave the gift, if they would mind if you return the gift, you appreciate the thought, but the gift doesn't really suit you and you don't want to collect stuff on the shelf which will just gather dust and end up in a landfill, better someone else gets it and you can get some money to buy something you want.", "  I think her \"gifts from her girls\" schtick was her attempt to cover the REAL reason: she wants to spend HER money on things for her family. \n\n   THIS is exactly why I don't like the gift exchange thing among people who *can* afford it. There is always one person who thinks they are sooo clever\\~they buy some decades-old potpourri at the dollar store & then act like it's Opera Prima by Bulgari. \n\n   IMO, these exchanges are much more fun if you have a White Elephant exchange\\~we all get rid of something we don't want, and are then free to donate  it!", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou can do what you want with your gifts.", "NTA. Ask her if she wants the plastic whistle.", "NTA, I\u2019m not so bothered by the price tag as I am about her sloughing off the \u201cshopping\u201d onto her kids. Secret Santas require a little thought and care, her gift would have been appropriate for a white elephant, but a 3 figure secret santa?? If she had a head on her shoulders, she could\u2019ve included her kids\u2019 gift alongside something that matched the brief", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Listen, even when I get \u201cnice\u201d gifts, if it\u2019s something I know I don\u2019t want or will use, I return it. I hate having stuff that just sits there without any purpose. Usually I can do this and the person never knows, UNLESS the gift giver asks me, then I\u2019ll be honest. But definitely keep it to yourself in the future.", "ESH. Returning a gift you can't use is not mean. There's way too much crap on this planet. The problem is talking about it to another family member. Yeah, it was not super nice for auntie to cheap out on you if your family usually does gifts more generously. And that's a little depressing. \n\nBut nobody is owed a gift, and being sullen about it to other family members doesn't help, does it?

The agreement is a minimum $250 gift. How much did you put in for yours? Your aunt is an AH, and shouldn\u2019t get away with it. I\u2019d be pissed if I was required to spend that much and to get so little in return. I honestly hate these kinds of events, and reading what happened to you really be pisses me off. I want you to expose her.", "Either she had a $25 card and let the kids use it to buy your gifts, giving you the card with the $17 balance left on it, or, she took something else back to the store to return it and they gave her her refund on a gift card, which is what they do if you don't have a receipt.", "Or she returned something without a receipt and was given a store credit\u2026.\n\nAunt really failed at the Secret Santa.
