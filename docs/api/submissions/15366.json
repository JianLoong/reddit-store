But, given the other comments he has made, YOU NEED to have a frank conversation with him about WHY you feel uncomfortable about this.

You won't really win this specific argument b/c it, him giving her rides to and from the city when he is going there himself is pretty normal, standard, economizing and helpful behavior. If you call it inappropriate, you will look like a jealous, unreasonable person.\n\nHowever, your husband blurting out twice that he wants to go on a roadtrip with your sister IS inappropriate - so you are NOT wrong at all wrong to feel uncomfortable about your husband potentially being alone w/ you sister and specifically with her in a car.\n\nBUT: The issue is you don't trust your husband alone w/ your sister (for good reason) - car or no car.
