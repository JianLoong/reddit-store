{"id": 32492, "submission_id": "18cbdnt", "title": "AITA for wanting my roommates friends to leave when he goes to work?", "selftext": "I (36f) have been living with my roommate (25m) for about 5 months. We'll call him Owen. He's a good roommate and we get along really well. He also loves my cat which is a big plus. :)\n\nLately, I have been getting really frustrated with the way he handles having guests who stay with him. I'm totally fine with him having friends come and stay at our place. They have mostly all been respectful (one particular friend is super loud - he has a voice that is very resonant and carries throughout the house, but I don't think he realizes). But it is annoying that he will tell me that a friend is staying \"the weekend\" and will be there from Thu-Mon. I'm sorry...I thought the \"weekend\" was Fri-Sun. \n\nMy main issue is that when Owen goes to work, his friends will stay behind and be at our house all day - sometimes alone when I have to go to work as well. Owen works two different jobs on Sat/Sun so he is literally gone all day. I've brought it up to him that I'm uncomfortable with these (essentially) strangers in the house when he's not home. His response was \"well what do you suggest they do?\" And I replied with \"I suggest you take off work and spend time with your friends. It's weird that you have friends stay for several days and work the majority of the time.\" \n\nI get that he's young and his friends are as well so they can't afford to stay at hotels or whatever, but I think that if he has guests, he should take off a day or two of work, spend that time with his friends, and then they should go home when he has to go back to work. \n\nSo AITA for wanting them to leave when he's not there?", "created_utc": 1701889400, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18cbdnt/aita_for_wanting_my_roommates_friends_to_leave/", "score": 39, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I think he needs to understand that not only is it rude for him to burden you like that without first checking to see if you are up for hosting his guests... It is also not really a thing he gets to negotiate - they aren't on the lease, they don't pay, so it's not really your problem where they go and what they do. He seems kind of oblivious.", "NTA. Of all the times when people have allowed me to stay in their home on vacation, I have never once considered staying there when the host wasn't there, especially if other housemates live there. Among the reasons is I want to see the area, treat myself to lunch, check out museums or whatever, not sit inside someone's house. I leave when the host leaves in the morning, and return when the host returns (or even better, I meet the host outside their workplace so I can treat them to dinner as a thank-you). I wouldn't want strangers in my apartment all day when I'm working.", "NTA  Agreed that you shouldn't have some stranger  staying at your place alone during the weekend and your roommate isn't there.  I'd want the place to myself, too, without Rando #5 lurking around.\n\nTell him no more.  They leave when he leaves.  This is an apartment, not a hotel.", "NTA. That's a SUPER reasonable request and it's pretty audacious of him to respond the way he did when you raised it.", "I would have responded \"they can do whatever they want to, just not here.\"\n\nI don't think you'd be rude to introduce a new rule that any guests can't be there without their host. \n\nI think it's strange that a friend would come to visit and be content just to sit in an apartment that's not home, all day, without their host. Why did they go there?\n\nNTA", "NTA. I would suggest you let him know you aren\u2019t comfortable with the current situation and talk through a compromise that works for both of you. Maybe he only has out of town guests one weekend a month? Or maybe out of town guests are Friday-Sunday?  I think it\u2019s unreasonable to ask him not to have guests at all or that he has to be there every second, but finding a compromise you both can live with is key here.", "NTA.  You both have very different ideas of what guests are and how long they should stay. He's much younger than you so I assume his friends are just using your place to crash for free while they're in your area.  \n\nHave a conversation and let him know you are not comfortable leaving strangers in your home and treating it like a hotel.  If that doesn't work find a new roommate or place to live.\n\nAt the very least, limit these friend to Friday and Saturday night and they're gone by Sunday. But even then, if it happens on a frequent basis it's too much and too many people in your home.", "NTA.  It normal to have establish clear rules for overnight guests\u2026.. and long term guests.  No more than one long term guest a month for no longer than 4 nights.", "NTA.\n\nIn the context of roommates, a \"guest\" is someone who visits you **while you are there**! I mean, if you live alone you can invite people to stay at your house for however long you like, but that's different. If feels completely weird to let your guests stay alone with your roommate or alone without your roommate. \n\nThat said, these kinds of cultural assumptions of what's normal as so tricky if you didn't discuss or write anything down when you became roommates. It is certainly worth talking. If he won't change, this is a completely reasonable to not renew with him when your lease comes up or kick him out if you are the main leaseholder and he's month-to-month.", "NTA. To leave strangers in the house when you're not there is not okay. When he leaves, they need to leave.", "\u201cWhat do you suggest they do?\u201d Umm, oh I don\u2019t know, pay up if they\u2019re going to occupy your space.\n\nHere are the facts: You pay for your place, which includes common areas (kitchen, bathroom, living room, etc.) and they don\u2019t. That means they get no say over how that space is used. If they want to relegate themselves to their friends bedroom, maybe that\u2019s fine because that\u2019s the space he \u201cowns.\u201d Everything else though \u2014 you pay for it, they don\u2019t. \n\nNTA.", "NTA.  I don\u2019t like random people in my home, either.", "NTA, I could understans if they were just there to sleep and maybe being alone for a few hours before they get up and dressed and go do their thing but just hanging around all day is weird and uncomfortable.", "Yta I'll prob get down voted but it's his space too he's allowed to have guests and he can give them permission to be there when he wants them to be.", "INFO: Did you two find this house together at the same time, or was one of you established in the space beforehand? How long have you known your roommate?", "NTA", "You are entitled to your opinion, too. But it seems that my comfort level doesn't matter at all? I should just be okay with strangers in my house when he's not home?", "I have lived there for almost 3 years. He moved in 5 months ago. We met through a mutual friend when I was looking for a new roommate (last roommate was moving to another state for work).", "I didn't say it didn't matter but if u don't like it move out. He told u they were coming for the weekend and he has work. He's allowed to have guests over. If u don't like it don't live with him. U can't just move in with someone tho and dictate how they are with their friends and when they can be there.", "I am not sure how long you have known him for, but he is 25. Did you have a conversation with him about living expectations before he moved in (including rules when it comes to guests)? Like you said, he is young and so are his friends. They likely cannot afford hotels and he may not be able to take off work every time they visit. It doesn\u2019t seem that uncommon for people in their 20s to hang out at a close friend\u2019s house when they are not home for the day. \n\nNAH. You are not unreasonable for not wanting guests in your house when no one is home, but assuming the guests are remaining in his room or the common spaces, then he isn\u2019t unreasonable for having guests there. If they were entering your room or somehow trashing the space, then it would be a problem. \n\nYou should probably sit down and have a serious conversation with him about expectations, but don\u2019t be surprised if he gets upset when you push the issue.", "I'm on the lease. He's not. He pays me rent.", "Okay he pays rent he's a tenant he has rights. If u don't want to deal with it have evict him but while he lives there he gets to have ppl over at his home"]}
