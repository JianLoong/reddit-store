Here's what happened. Sorry in advance if my grammar isn\u2019t the best I tried.\n\nI(16f) am enrolled in a summer learning program (it\u2019s basically summer school but with a field day once a week and no homework) and the classes have been going on since school let out, so around 2 weeks. \nI was put into the same class as Ava, who has Tourettes. I\u2019ve met her a few times before and saw her around in hallways but we never had classes together before. She\u2019s nice and I genuinely don\u2019t have anything against her it\u2019s just I can\u2019t concentrate with her in the class. \nAt first, I sat behind her but I would constantly see her have very sudden movements so I moved to the front only to realize that she also makes a lot of noise. I\u2019m not just saying a small click or whistle now and again. It's constant whistling, random words, and barking? It\u2019s so distracting and most people in the class laugh it off because we know she cant control it. \nI knew I wouldn\u2019t be a good fit for that classroom so I asked the counselor there to switch my class to the other one. She started asking me why and at first I didn\u2019t want to say because I didn't want to come off as rude, but fearing that I was being bullied or something she pressed and I finally told her it was because of Ava. Well, turns out Ava\u2019s best friend was waiting for the counselor outside and could hear our conversation and she told everyone. I still got my class changed, but a handful of people in my old class are calling me TA for being, in their words, ableist. I have ADHD, and dyslexia (which is why I\u2019m in the program), and being in a classroom is already hard enough without a constant distraction. \nI told my parents what was going on and to my surprise, they scolded me. My cousin has Tourettes and they said they thought they raised me better than to pick on disabled people.\n\nTLDR; I switched classes because a girl with Tourettes was too distracting, and now my classmates and parents think I\u2019m TA\n\nEDIT: Hi everyone, thank you all for commenting I read all of them and I appreciate your imput. I checked my email and tomorrow I have an \u201curgent meeting\u201d with the program director, counselor and my parents. I saw that Ava and her parents were also in the email chain so I believe they\u2019ll be there too.

That class was not your least restrictive environment. Glad you made the switch and hope the classes go better for you!", "NTA - they're being ablest towards you. \n\nThis is not the disability Olympics it's fair for an ADHD student to be separated from a tourettes one. The counsellor screwed up, there was supposed to be protocol to prevent students from overhearing. I'm sorry that your parents and counsellor failed you here.", "NTA \n\nYour needs were not being met in the class due to the distraction, so you advocated for your best interests.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t pick on the girl or bully her. You tried to make accommodations yourself, and when that failed you escalated it to someone who can help. You didn\u2019t do anything to punish the girl. You\u2019re totally in the clear and you handled this just fine, as far as I can tell from your story.", "NTA. My neighbour/friend has Tourette\u2019s with verbal tics whilst I have C-PTSD and pre-existing sensory issues. If she tics, I flinch. If I flinch, she tends to tic. We usually end up giggling so hard at the absurdity of the cycle, we eventually stop!\n\n\nWhilst we both get a good laugh out of it, we\u2019ve spoken a lot about how our reactions show it\u2019s a terrible idea for organisations to shove all the \u2018disableds\u2019 into a single category. Disabled people may need reasonable adjustments and unfortunately when disabilities conflict, it isn\u2019t an easy fix.\n\n\nNot sure how well you know the lass in your school, but if you\u2019re comfortable, it may be worth letting her know that you\u2019re also disabled and it\u2019s just an adjustment incompatibility rather than anything to do with her!", "NTA. You deserve to have an environment which is conducive to you being able to concentrate.", "NTA. A distraction is a distraction and you\u2019re allowed to remove yourself from a situation where you won\u2019t flourish. \n\nThere is another consideration here, though. Ava will have heard about this and she will have some feelings, about you and about herself. I think it\u2019s important to talk to her and clear the air. Not in public. you don\u2019t want people to think this is some performative thing. I\u2019d ask for a private moment with her and tell her that you know she probably heard about your class switching and that her name came up. That you think she\u2019s a cool person, but that because of your own issues (ADHD, etc.) you want to see if a quieter situation will help.", "NTA. Everyone else is TA for trying to make you feel guilty over this. You have a right to a districted learning environment. Having a mental health issue is no excuse for impacting others\u2019 lives in a profoundly negative way. Had you stayed in that class just to seem \u201ctolerant,\u201d it could have impacted your GPA, your future college, etc. NTA.", "NTA and I frankly I would make a complaint to the school administration about another student breaching your privacy by listening in on your counselling session. Those are private for a reason. They need to do a better job sound proofing if she just happen to innocently overhear you but her actions after the fact we're wildly immature for someone accusing you of being ableist", "NTA. You are requesting a reasonable accommodation for your own disabilities, Ava and her friends should seriously be *supportive* of you for handling it calmly and not causing a commotion.", "NTA  \nYou also have a learning impairment and with ADHD, I would imagine it's hard to concentrate with such a distraction.", "NTA - If you can\u2019t learn because of her behavior, you have a right to switch classes", "NTA. Also, the school should discipline the girl who blabbed and the counselor should be more careful in the future to make sure her conversations are confidential.", "Nta. Everyone has their own tolerance level to distractions . You are more sensitive to them, which a lot of people with ADHD (and not with ADHD) are. You shouldn\u2019t be shamed for this just like this girl shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed for having Tourette\u2019s.", "NTA. You didn't change because of anything against her, you changed because you couldn't concentrate and do the best you could do academically while being in there.", "NTA - switching classes because it was distracting is not wrong ***but*** you say your cousin was shocked at you \"picking on disabled people.\" Nothing in your story here sounds like you did that yet you also don't seem to dispute it. If you legitimately told no one but the counselor and her friend simply \"over-heard\", then you are in the clear. If there is any more to that story though, my answer would be different.", "NAH - I have mixed feelings here, but since you're 16 I don't think you're an asshole.  The thing is, in real life you aren't always going to be able to switch classes and you're just going to have to learn to live with distractions like this because there will always be distractions.  This might mean you have to take medication, it might mean you need ADHD coaching or therapy but you're going to need to figure it out.  But right now you're 16, it takes a LONG time to figure that out.  That's why we have IEPs, accommodations and modifications.  I'm 35 and I'm still figuring this stuff out.  I'm a SPED teacher and my students are constantly working on figuring this stuff out (and I have lots of students with ADHD and students with turrets in the same room).  I don't think you're an asshole for doing what is best for you with the tools you currently have to work with, but you might want to figure out a way to cope long term.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It isn't about her disability. It's the noise. I'd go as far as to say it's the class as a whole. They laugh at the sounds she makes, and that can be equally distracting. As it's uncontrollable and incompatible with your disability you removed yourself to a more compatible environment.\n\nIf you were demanding she be removed, that would have been different.", "NTA. Ava can't control it, but it is affecting you because of things you can't control.

The word \u201cableist\u201d gets thrown around so freaking loosely these days it\u2019s ridiculous. If you don\u2019t cater to someone with some type of disorder or disability in any which way, or if you don\u2019t patronize them with fake kindness, you\u2019re suddenly ableist. Enough of this social justice narrative BS already!\n\nThat term is mostly used by do gooders who think saying that term, suddenly makes them a better person than everyone else. Which isn\u2019t the case at all. Yes, your classmate cannot help her tics and noises. But that doesn\u2019t make you the AH, for wanting to concentrate on your work. It\u2019s also very thoughtful you went to the counselor about this, rather than confronting your classmate about her tics. \n\nWe definitely get annoyed by our tics too believe it or not hahah. Anyone saying your the AH is full of it and just categorizes people with Tourette\u2019s in some big group with the rest of the diagnosed disorders. Tourette\u2019s isn\u2019t the same thing as Down syndrome, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, etc. we don\u2019t need feigned sympathy 24/7. Especially if you\u2019re only doing it for brownie points. \n\nIf I caught people trying to do this crap on my behalf, I\u2019d probably ask them what the fuck is wrong with them. I\u2019m not mute, and I\u2019m entitled to my own opinions and feelings, as is your classmate.

In literally no way was any of that \"picking on\" a disabled person. (seriously the only person who was mean to Ava was her so called \"Friend\" who immediately went and tattled.

Can you report them for harassing you over your entirely reasonable request?", "I'm going to disagree with these people. First off you did nothing wrong. Second, if she really is upset, then you forcing the issue is likely to cause more harm than good. It sounds like she's perfectly willing to believe her \"\"\"friend's\"\"\" narrative. That means that you trying to explain what happened is just going to cause her more stress (and cause you a lot of useless anxiety). \n\nIf she confronts you, that is your opportunity to tell her that her so call friend lied.

You didn't say hateful things about Ava, this wasn't even about *her.* It's about you and your ability to focus. I'm sorry your parents don't see it that way. You haven't done anything wrong.

You're dealing with your own learning challenges due to your ADHD and advocating for a classroom switch is an easy solution. If you have a 504 plan or an IEP, this shouldn't be a big issue because I imagine you'd have certain accommodations already documented. If you don't, now might be a great time to request a 504 plan from your guidance counselor.

My ADHD makes me unable to access the content when there are any kinds of ongoing disruptions or distractions. \n\u2022 It's unfortunate another student was eavesdropping outside the door of what should  to be a confidential area. It's unfortunate that another student decided to share my personal information in a way that upset her friend. \n\u2022 I used the provided school resource, my counselor, to request a simple accommodation  in order to access content in class. \n\nEtc, etc. I hope your parents are going with you and support you.
