{"id": 6092, "submission_id": "zzp1cd", "title": "AITA for saying no when my former roommate demanded board in my house?", "selftext": "I (24F) live in an apartment in NYC. I used to have another girl (23F) living with me, until a few months ago I decided to get my own apartment, and she chose to move in with her boyfriend. She\u2019s in school.\n\nI\u2019m in a professional degree program and have been preparing for the next semester. She appeared at my door suddenly one evening, interrupting my studying. So I had to stop and go answer the door. She was just standing there, looking unkempt with crazy eyes.\n\nBefore I could ask why she was at my home uninvited at this hour, just rushed inside like she owned the place. She began telling me her story of woe. How her boyfriend was being \u201cverbally abusive\u201d and she had to get out of there. She hasn\u2019t bothered to plan ahead. He had thrown her out of the apartment, and she needed to fly home to her parents, but her flight was delayed so she was asking to spend the night with me.\n\nI resisted the urge to roll my eyes. She was never a bright one when we were living together, and she was always dating this guy who she could never get along with. It\u2019s just like her to get emotional because she couldn\u2019t handle confrontation, and be shortsighted running away without a plan instead of addressing things. So once her flight got cancelled and she couldn\u2019t flee home (she still lives with her parents for a good part of the year despite our age), she decided to become a burden on me instead.\n\nI asked what she\u2019s doing here. I\u2019m not her mother or responsible for her. She said she just needs a place to spend the night and began listing her problems. I said not to start with that, save her venting for therapy, and asked what makes her think she\u2019s entitled to come into my home. She said since we lived together she thought she could ask me. I said she lives with her boyfriend, so go home to him. She said she can\u2019t because it\u2019s his apartment. And whose fault is that, I wondered. She\u2019s a grown adult and isn\u2019t contributing to rent, sounds like he\u2019s right to throw her out. She said she does contribute what she can. Again, sounds like poor decision-making. \n\nThen she began to literally *wail.* Like a toddler. I had had it with her, and I said if she was going to act like a victim to leave because I don\u2019t deal with victims. Either grow a backbone and go back to deal with her boyfriend or find a motel. She claimed they were all booked out, but I felt my generosity was being taken advantage of at that point, and I was done entertaining her. I asked her to please leave the property. She protested, and I couldn\u2019t believe the entitlement. I pointed out that she was now trespassing.\n\nSo she reluctantly left. I was bone-tired from dealing with her drama and went to bed, not even getting my scheduled studying done. In the morning I was awaken by an angry message from her about my mistreatment of her. I pointed out that if you\u2019re being \u201cmistreated\u201d by your boyfriend, by me, etc. the common denominator is you.

She was asking for one night on a couch or whatever until her plane, not to move in. It was very late at night, since you describe the hour as being am antisocial one. \n\nI think I'd probably do that for most friends or people I had a long standing relationship with (like former flatmates or coworkers), unless I had a reason to think they were dishonest/awful.

She's 23 and should find her own apartment or at least make better decisions and clearly needs to learn some communication skills.\n\n> How her boyfriend was being \u201cverbally abusive\u201d\n\nHow was he being \"verbally abusive\"? because this could be a serious issue, but if it's just an argument that they were having about rent or her not helping in the apartment (cleaning, cooking sometimes, rent ect.) Then that's not abusive, but both of them need to communicate. Shouting is a normal reaction especially after a few attempts of trying to make it clear about a certain thing, but communication should always come after that. \n\nHere's where you are the asshole. \n\n> I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. She was never a bright one when we were living together, and she was always dating this guy who she could never get along with.\n\nThis was a bit harsh in my opinion, you didn't have to insult her like that. You could have been nicer.

She said since we lived together she thought she could ask me.\n\nShe thought you were her friend, and could at least rely on you for one night. She had no right to just run into the house, but you could have heard her out, and not been so hurtful. She was clearly stressed. I agree she probably does need therapy, can't really tell by the post, but you didn't have to say it like that. again, she was emotional, and you could have gone about it nicer. \n\nBasically, yes she has her own issues, and had no right to do what she did. She needs to learn better communication, and to help out more around the house/apartment. \nBut you also could also have been nicer, maybe heard her out properly. I get it, you were studying, but she thought she could rely on you, as you had previously lived together and she may have considered you a friend.

You can't help everyone that's for sure, and you have every right to refuse to give her a couch for the night, honestly that's not the issue here, the problem is how you judge her and her life. You could advise her to tell the police about it, or you could just have nice words to calm her down so she could have left reassured, in fact you could have just been human with her , if she is immature, what are you?
