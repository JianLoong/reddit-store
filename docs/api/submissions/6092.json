{"id": 6092, "submission_id": "zzp1cd", "title": "AITA for saying no when my former roommate demanded board in my house?", "selftext": "I (24F) live in an apartment in NYC. I used to have another girl (23F) living with me, until a few months ago I decided to get my own apartment, and she chose to move in with her boyfriend. She\u2019s in school.\n\nI\u2019m in a professional degree program and have been preparing for the next semester. She appeared at my door suddenly one evening, interrupting my studying. So I had to stop and go answer the door. She was just standing there, looking unkempt with crazy eyes.\n\nBefore I could ask why she was at my home uninvited at this hour, just rushed inside like she owned the place. She began telling me her story of woe. How her boyfriend was being \u201cverbally abusive\u201d and she had to get out of there. She hasn\u2019t bothered to plan ahead. He had thrown her out of the apartment, and she needed to fly home to her parents, but her flight was delayed so she was asking to spend the night with me.\n\nI resisted the urge to roll my eyes. She was never a bright one when we were living together, and she was always dating this guy who she could never get along with. It\u2019s just like her to get emotional because she couldn\u2019t handle confrontation, and be shortsighted running away without a plan instead of addressing things. So once her flight got cancelled and she couldn\u2019t flee home (she still lives with her parents for a good part of the year despite our age), she decided to become a burden on me instead.\n\nI asked what she\u2019s doing here. I\u2019m not her mother or responsible for her. She said she just needs a place to spend the night and began listing her problems. I said not to start with that, save her venting for therapy, and asked what makes her think she\u2019s entitled to come into my home. She said since we lived together she thought she could ask me. I said she lives with her boyfriend, so go home to him. She said she can\u2019t because it\u2019s his apartment. And whose fault is that, I wondered. She\u2019s a grown adult and isn\u2019t contributing to rent, sounds like he\u2019s right to throw her out. She said she does contribute what she can. Again, sounds like poor decision-making. \n\nThen she began to literally *wail.* Like a toddler. I had had it with her, and I said if she was going to act like a victim to leave because I don\u2019t deal with victims. Either grow a backbone and go back to deal with her boyfriend or find a motel. She claimed they were all booked out, but I felt my generosity was being taken advantage of at that point, and I was done entertaining her. I asked her to please leave the property. She protested, and I couldn\u2019t believe the entitlement. I pointed out that she was now trespassing.\n\nSo she reluctantly left. I was bone-tired from dealing with her drama and went to bed, not even getting my scheduled studying done. In the morning I was awaken by an angry message from her about my mistreatment of her. I pointed out that if you\u2019re being \u201cmistreated\u201d by your boyfriend, by me, etc. the common denominator is you.

You're not an \"asshole\" for not wanting an unexpected uninvited guest.\n\n But - sorry to say this - you sound like a pretty unkind, unpleasant, judgemental sort of person. She was asking for one night on a couch or whatever until her plane, not to move in. It was very late at night, since you describe the hour as being am antisocial one. \n\nI think I'd probably do that for most friends or people I had a long standing relationship with (like former flatmates or coworkers), unless I had a reason to think they were dishonest/awful. INFO Do you have something against her in particular? Was she a bad flatmate/person? Or would you just not extend that sort of kindness as a rule?", "ESH. \n> She said she can\u2019t because it\u2019s his apartment. And whose fault is that, I wondered.

She's 23 and should find her own apartment or at least make better decisions and clearly needs to learn some communication skills.\n\n> How her boyfriend was being \u201cverbally abusive\u201d\n\nHow was he being \"verbally abusive\"? because this could be a serious issue, but if it's just an argument that they were having about rent or her not helping in the apartment (cleaning, cooking sometimes, rent ect.) Then that's not abusive, but both of them need to communicate. Shouting is a normal reaction especially after a few attempts of trying to make it clear about a certain thing, but communication should always come after that. \n\nHere's where you are the asshole. \n\n> I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. She was never a bright one when we were living together, and she was always dating this guy who she could never get along with.\n\nThis was a bit harsh in my opinion, you didn't have to insult her like that. You could have been nicer. And it's not really your business who she dates, that's for her. \n\n> I said not to start with that, save her venting for therapy, and asked what makes her think she\u2019s entitled to come into my home. She said since we lived together she thought she could ask me.\n\nShe thought you were her friend, and could at least rely on you for one night. She had no right to just run into the house, but you could have heard her out, and not been so hurtful. She was clearly stressed. I agree she probably does need therapy, can't really tell by the post, but you didn't have to say it like that. again, she was emotional, and you could have gone about it nicer. \n\nBasically, yes she has her own issues, and had no right to do what she did. She needs to learn better communication, and to help out more around the house/apartment. \nBut you also could also have been nicer, maybe heard her out properly. I get it, you were studying, but she thought she could rely on you, as you had previously lived together and she may have considered you a friend.

You can't help everyone that's for sure, and you have every right to refuse to give her a couch for the night, honestly that's not the issue here, the problem is how you judge her and her life. You could advise her to tell the police about it, or you could just have nice words to calm her down so she could have left reassured, in fact you could have just been human with her , if she is immature, what are you?

They never want actual help but to freeload and complain about this girls said problems every time. \n\nI\u2019ve ended 4-5 friendships with women because they\u2019re boy crazy, not bright, refuse to get help for their problems, can\u2019t hold a job, never take responsibility or accountability, and refuse to BE a person in the world.

You could never get her out.", "To everyone saying Y T A, you'd let *anyone* with whom you've had a business relationship barge into your home without notice and just like, stay because they happened to think of you as an easy mark? That's great for you. But here's why OP is objectively NTA:\n\nOP observed this woman's behavior during their prior lease term. OP also seems to understand that past behavior is the best indicator of future behavior. Here's another newsflash - it's (still) 2022, and telephones exist. Roommate could have, I dunno, CALLED OP and said, \"Is it ok of I crash at your place?\" Instead, Roommate appeared at OP's door and expected a place to sleep. Roommate clearly misconstrued a contractual property arrangement as a friendship. OP is not responsible for Roommate's choices or misunderstandings. OP clarified Roommate's misunderstandings.

I first went to my grandmother's, who basically told me to stick it out until I'm 18 and if I wanted to leave, I should've planned it better. That her son (my biological father) was her problem for years and she's done her time dealing with his BS so a few years on my part won't \"hurt\" and it couldn't be \"that bad\". Her precious baby boy had nearly killed me on more than one occasion. I was desperate for an out. I went to who I thought I could trust only to be told to suck it up so I resorted to asking every single person I knew even vaguely if I could crash on their couch for a few weeks. I would've done anything to earn my keep. I couldn't go back. I was alone and scared. My biological mother kept telling me a \"little while longer\" until she could take me in when, in reality, she didn't want me disturbing her life with her new boyfriend. \n\nI've been to the point of messily fleeing an abusive situation, begging anyone to shelter me even for a short period. It's hard to do and someone has to reach a breaking point to do so. It's not something you make a spur of the moment choice on. It's desperation at its finest. One night is nothing. I would've made it clear after that night I'm not the person to turn to but I think if anyone showed up on my doorstep begging for shelter for just a singular night that I personally knew I would allow it. Even my abusive ex. If he showed up, I would have enough compassion to allow 1 night for the sake of our past (before it turned abusive). I've been told my \"fatal flaw\" is caring too much or being overly forgiving, so maybe that's just me. There's only maybe 3 or 4 people in this entire world I would turn away. I'm the type that I purposely keep care packets in the car for homeless people and will give any change I have to someone if I think they need it. I use to invite a local homeless guy to dinner with me every Thursday evening when I was in my teens. I would set aside 10 bucks to buy cheap Chinese food as sorta of a treat/relax day for myself without my siblings constantly up my ass. I invited the guy once to join me and he was so appreciative of the fact that someone cared enough to give him a warm meal and offer an ear that I ended up inviting him every week after that. He just wanted someone to talk to and be treated as an equal human being for even an hour once a week.

Then don\u2019t let it happen again. Poof. \n\nI bet OP - who seems to have everything figured out - can pontificate about some 30 second feminist cliche.

In certain academic disciplines, it can be nearly the entire faculty in my experience. \n\nI remember when I was living/working in Italy for a bit and we hosted a fairly big name America-based academic (he has more citations than most Nobel laureates in my discipline). It was like hosting a toddler. If something started late or ran on long, he would have a complete meltdown. It's Italy: literally nothing starts on time. Things run late. The rest of us (including my always punctual German colleague) got over it and learned to just go with the flow (it certainly made me feel better when public transport was running late (which is all the goddamn time). \n\nHe would also lose his shit every time with how long people would take to eat lunch. It didn't matter if we communicated it was going to be a 90-120 minute lunch for some of us that day because that group was going into the field that day and would grab a meal near where we were working. He'd be back at a fixed time and then obsessively pace back-and-forth while staring at his watch and muttering under his breath. And mind you, we were not preventing him from doing his work. Lunch breaks had to be a fixed duration and everyone had to be back at the same time. \n\nGroup meals or dinners were always a hoot. He was just dead set on never splitting a check. And I get it when you only order a salad and water and the rest of the table orders surf and turf, multiple cocktails, and wine, but that wasn't our crowd. Most people's totals came out relatively close. But as soon as the meal was done, he was already pulling out his wallet and coin purse to pay his exact total. It was just a principals thing for him. \n\nHe was an interesting one.
