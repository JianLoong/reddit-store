Sometimes they would say something like \"I'll buy you a lunch and you can help me to put together my new shelf, whaddya say?\"\n\nThis was A MUTUAL AGREEMENT. It was not something I asked for or expected without any contribution from my part. Your friend group obviously didn't have such arrangements. If the friend had financial difficulties, she should have been honest about it. Good friends are usually understanding and sympathetic.

It\u2019s not her you had a problem with it was that isolated behavior - you still like HER.\n\n2. You understand that maybe she can\u2019t afford to eat out like everyone else seems to be able to do. So she probably wanted to be included but couldn\u2019t pay - if that\u2019s the case there needs to be communication so the group can switch gears and do something everyone can afford. Or it could even be as simple as we all split something to save money so we can have the experience and if it\u2019s not enough food, we can fill up when we get home.\n\n3. If these instances were all genuine mistakes and the lack of repayment is truly forgetfulness then she can just pay everyone back. (Not necessarily all at once) Then in the future if she forgets her wallet, she can do an instant transfer electronically through zelle or Venmo.\n\nThat\u2019s only if the friendship of really worth salvaging.
