That's a conversation that should take place only between the offender and their offended parties. Otherwise, it needed to be addressed sooner rather than later. I probably would have accepted the invite and then coordinated with the others to \"forget\" your wallets, but a dine-n-dash isn't fair to restaurant staff just to make a point to your friend.", "NTA she is not someone who is a real friend.", "NTA.  Good riddance", "NTA. Once is a mistake, twice is on purpose. After a couple of rounds of \"forgetting\", I'd have started every meal out by asking for separate checks.", "NTA. It just goes to show you. She didn\u2019t appreciate that you guys covered her all those times. Only mad because you stopped and called her on it.", "NTA.  But next time, just all use Splitwise app (or similar) on your phones.", "NTA however to say she left the group chat out of nowhere is a little obtuse.", "Nta. You just waited too long.", "[removed]", "Nta. No wonder she invited you guys to lunch. She won\u2019t have to pay! She got upset she was called out and left because she knows you\u2019re all over paying for her. If she was helping sometimes it would be different, but how can you lose your wallet every time you go to lunch? Or even if she is hungry I\u2019m sure she could be honest instead of pulling this crap.", "NTA. Your \"friend\" is a mooch and you were right to confront her. Now she will have to find a new group of suckers.", "NTA\n\nConsider this about a $200 lesson on the type of friend she is. That\u2019s cheap if you ask me.", "\n\nNTA. You had a right to speak up to your friend since she had been continuously taking advantage of the group dynamic. Instead of going behind her back, you decided to confront the situation head on with the rest of the group and with your friend present. It's also understandable why your other friends in the group might be frustrated with the situation, since they had to foot her bill many times before and your friend left the group chat and blocked you.", "Definitely NTA. She was freedoading and using you all. \n\nI struggled financially for years and my friends all knew it. They sometimes asked me to join them for a lunch, for example, and offered to pay since they knew I couldn't come otherwise. In return, I paid for somethig I COULD afford the next time we would meet. Coffee, ice cream, piece of cheesecake or something like that. Sometimes they would say something like \"I'll buy you a lunch and you can help me to put together my new shelf, whaddya say?\"\n\nThis was A MUTUAL AGREEMENT. It was not something I asked for or expected without any contribution from my part. Your friend group obviously didn't have such arrangements. If the friend had financial difficulties, she should have been honest about it. Good friends are usually understanding and sympathetic. Friends help each other out, might offer to pay so everyone could be included or figure out something more affordable to do.\n\nGood riddance. I hope the other girls in your gropu are more worthy of your friendship.", "NTA, she knew what she was doing and she will find her justification no matter how wrong it  is. Her blocking you all is her says it all.   \n\n\nThose kinds of people will not pay you back, it will maybe take a long time before they do.", "NTA. But\u2026 what if she is poor and her family is barely making it? If she is truly a friend whom you care about, ask questions and listen to her answers. You\u2019re not wrong in the situation you described, but you may also have brought her poverty out in front of the whole group.", "NTA but that probably was not the best approach. Confronting someone in a group chat can be embarrassing to them. Sound like we was using you though so good riddance", "NTA. There's a chance she's going through some financial hardship, but if she is she should tell you guys up front or ask to do something else, like hang out at a park or go for something cheap like just a coffee. The fact that she asked if you guys wanted to go to lunch throws a wrench in that though. It sounds like she was using you guys for free lunch.", "I\u2019m a total pushover and I would\u2019ve allowed this twice before I said anything.", "Yep she might have forgotten her wallet but don't teenage girls (stereotypically) have their phones grafted to them, so she can use apple pay/google pay to pay the restaurant or various cash apps to pay her ~~friends~~ generous benefactors\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP (and most of group) Is NTA", "they didn't get their money back though unfortunately", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
