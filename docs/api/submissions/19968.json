She was freedoading and using you all. \n\nI struggled financially for years and my friends all knew it. They sometimes asked me to join them for a lunch, for example, and offered to pay since they knew I couldn't come otherwise. In return, I paid for somethig I COULD afford the next time we would meet. Coffee, ice cream, piece of cheesecake or something like that. Sometimes they would say something like \"I'll buy you a lunch and you can help me to put together my new shelf, whaddya say?\"\n\nThis was A MUTUAL AGREEMENT. It was not something I asked for or expected without any contribution from my part. Your friend group obviously didn't have such arrangements. If the friend had financial difficulties, she should have been honest about it. Good friends are usually understanding and sympathetic. Friends help each other out, might offer to pay so everyone could be included or figure out something more affordable to do.\n\nGood riddance.

That\u2019s manipulative and underhanded.\n\nBased on her leaving the group chat and blocking everyone it seems she either didn\u2019t realize what she was doing or more likely is having a hard time taking accountability and making amends.\n\n In the spirit of compassion you could always reach out to let her know:\n\n1. It\u2019s not her you had a problem with it was that isolated behavior - you still like HER.\n\n2. You understand that maybe she can\u2019t afford to eat out like everyone else seems to be able to do. So she probably wanted to be included but couldn\u2019t pay - if that\u2019s the case there needs to be communication so the group can switch gears and do something everyone can afford. Or it could even be as simple as we all split something to save money so we can have the experience and if it\u2019s not enough food, we can fill up when we get home.\n\n3. If these instances were all genuine mistakes and the lack of repayment is truly forgetfulness then she can just pay everyone back. (Not necessarily all at once) Then in the future if she forgets her wallet, she can do an instant transfer electronically through zelle or Venmo.\n\nThat\u2019s only if the friendship of really worth salvaging.

He lost his mind. We refused to change saying it didn\u2019t matter we would all be buying rounds so it all came out in the wash. After he bought the first round we played a game of hide and seek in the bar, it was so crowded, that you couldn\u2019t just walk over to someone, it would take a while to squirm through the crowd. Anytime anyone saw him approach we would all split off in different directions. If he did catch anyone we would just say it wasn\u2019t our turn yet it must be so and so\u2019s turn.\n\nMy breaking point was one night when we all opened tabs, not him, and when it was his turn to get a round he said he didn\u2019t feel well and he wasn\u2019t drinking anymore.  We told him he should go find somewhere else to hang because he was bumming us out.\n\nHe went down to the end of the bar and took an seat. Place was jammed, had a great night, when ai closed out my tab, not only had he been down at the end of the bar drinking doubles, he ordered fucking dinner on my tab. \n\nI asked the bartender WTF, and he said the guy claimed he was me.
