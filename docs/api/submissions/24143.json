They probably clapped, went up and congratulated him one after the other and most likely even talked about it for a good amount of time.

It\u2019s not meant to be about anyone else unless those getting married want it to be. Proposing at someone\u2019s wedding unannounced, regardless of the relationship, is almost guaranteed to go south.

My take on this classic shit idea is that, for the most part, men are the ones proposing to women and doing it at someone else's wedding means they don't have to plan shit.
