Your parents missed a valid opportunity to teach \"No.\" They aren't doing you, your sister, or them any favors here. Learning how to say and receive \"No\" is absolutely necessary in life.\n\nInstead, they've reinforced a belief your feelings and autonomy do not matter, and that your sister can get her selfish way by having a tantrum. 11 is more than old enough to be told \"No, that isn't mine or yours.

At least you would have been with friends.\n\nAs soon as you're able, I suspect you'll be out of your parents' house and then you won't have to worry about these people anymore.", "NTA, and your father isn't doing your sister any favors by letting her have whatever she wants by crying for it.  Move out and cut all contact with your father.\n\nBTW, I admire your restraint.  If I were in your shoes at that age with that kind of provocation, I would have thrown the cake at the wall.", "NTA, but cancelling the whole thing was almost certainly an overreaction that cut off your nose to spite your face. You punished\u2026 yourself.", "NTA - I hate your parents (your sister isn\u2019t at fault as THEY allow her to act this way). But you should have just take your party to a public park or something.", "Please tell me that you cut the cake and smeared half of it on your parent\u2019s stuff and half on your sister\u2019s and told them they needed to clean it up themselves since they saw no problem with stealing your cake. Which is precisely what they did.", "NTA that is really shitty of your dad. You don\u2019t have to be a kid to enjoy and value your birthday celebration. That was YOUR cake and I would have been depressed about it too. I wouldn\u2019t invite your parents or your sister to your birthday parties in the future", "Definitely NTA. You worked hard for that party and cake, and boundaries were crossed. \n\nHope you find a way to celebrate that respects your efforts!", "NTA", "NTA\n\nI would schedule a new party, and not invite your family or sister.", "NTA.", "On the surface it might seem petty but it\u2019s actually not. Your parents are enabling your preteen sister and she\u2019s learning that she can manipulate her will onto people. \n\nYou don\u2019t need to grin and bear bad behavior from anyone.

And to be honest I probably would have cancelled too; if the party is at your parents house, you already know your sister is gonna be a brat and get all the attention and your parents will pull another stunt. Even if you paid for it yourself, and then be like \u201cit\u2019s our house\u201d", "NTA.

I would have actually cancelled my party as well.\n\nHow close are you to moving out?", "I'm pretty sure it wasn't the lack of pristine cake that made OP want to call off the party.", "What will they collage? Pictures, perhaps?", "OP didn't say she was doing it to prove a point. She said she didn't feel good about having it at home after what her parents did. Presumably, the parents would be IN the home while the party was happening. And since it's her birthday, she has every right to want to be happy and enjoy herself during the party, which she didn't feel was possible.", "Ah yes... this would have been more appropriate.", "Should have kept it at the house then announce loudly to everyone that there's a piece of cake missing because your parents gave it to your brat sister last night without asking", "I posted on another sub when I hadn't called it off yet.", "Oh I thought I was having d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!", "I have definitely learnt my lesson, I won't celebrate here and they won't be invited.", "I disagree. OP didn't say they canceled to spite their parents, they said they didn't feel good about having the party in the house, with the parents who had just done something horrible to them and especially the father who had said some real bullshit to them. That's not an overreaction.", "I was so mad, I didn't even eat it.", "This", "OMG this is the level of petty I aspire to.", "You're NTA and were free to make that decision. Are you second guessing yourself because you haven't been allowed to control things in your life because your parents cater to your sister?"]}
