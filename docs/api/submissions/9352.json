The day I found out that is used for things outside of animal rescues/crimes was the day I really saw the world for what it is. \n\nTW: violence \n\nI just don't see how you can find a sex worker dead with stab wounds and write down that there are no humans involved.

Even if *you're* cool with people seeing you like that, not everyone is cool with that level of nudity. \n\nI'm a former dance and theater kid. Nudity doesn't bother me.

This happened to me. He flipped out I wasn\u2019t wearing a bra in a baggy shirt. Said my tits were out for everyone to see. In my backyard with a privacy fence. So then I drilled him on what level of clothing I needed to wear to be \u2018decent\u2019 since in some bras, you can see nipple outlines. I wouldn\u2019t let it go and he got uncomfortable and mad.

UGH. ***UGH***.\n\n*deep breath*\n\nOkay, I\u2019m done, thank you for coming to my TED talk rant, please tip your waitstaff.", "Yeah, I felt that.

There\u2019s others that can explain it better than I.

Not here.", "OP should refrain from ANY relationships until he does some work on himself and rids himself of this heavy misogynist streak.", "I think that comment is going for the UK definition of \"fancy dress\", so think more like a Halloween costume or cosplay outfit.", "I typically wear a crop top and shorts when I\u2019m not at work and it\u2019s hot out.

You might want to proof read it once you've calmed down. Also you may struggle with the definition of some words but don't assume that of others. \n\nThe OP's girlfriend isn't walking around naked where she is at risk, she's wearing shorts in her own home in front of her own guests. He doesn't want her to stop because he feels she's at risk but because of some archaic and patriarchal view that her legs being seen by others is somehow disrespectful to him. So your absurd comparison to not helping her if she was being mugged makes no sense and shows a lack of understanding about the actual issues being discussed.\n\nYour ramblings about women showing up only looking pretty in a relationship again has no relevance to the OP's post so this comment seems to be more about your views on women. Also the word female is an adjective but there is a tenancy for incels to dehumanise women by using it as a noun. Your use of it that way is also very telling. Misogyny is the hated of, aversion to or prejudice against women and your post reeks of the latter.", "DAMN IT THATS WHAT I NEEDED", "I didn't read any of that.
