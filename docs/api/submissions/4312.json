You didn\u2019t go out of your way to tell her, she asked you directly. That\u2019s a tough spot, and maybe technically not your news to break, but she already figured it out, so I think being honest with her at the point was your only option. I get why your sister is a little upset, but you\u2019re still NTA", "NTA. She's an adult and if you are close and honestly tried to get her to ask her mom first then not AH.", "NTA. If the concern was her being \"taken away\" by her bio dad, they should have just told her when she turned 18. Instead they waited much longer than that, they waited until she *asked,* which makes me wonder what the actual reason her mom didn't want to tell her was because that logic doesn't check out.", "NTA.  She didn\u2019t go to Mom because she didn\u2019t trust Mom to tell her after twenty years of avoiding the subject.  And she wouldn\u2019t have brought it up at all if she wasn\u2019t already pretty sure she knew the answer, let alone phrased it as \u201cSteve\u2019s *not* my dad, is he?\u201d  If your sister wanted to be in control of how this was handled, she lost that opportunity a *long* way back, and your only responsibility was to deal with Anna as an adult looking for an honest answer.", "NAH - I'm sorry you are feeling blamed and guilt-tripped. I am sure it will pass. You had no malintent. Just continue to show your love and support.", "NTA - your niece came to you because she couldn't get the information anywhere else. Make sure your niece knows that she isn't responsible for any fallout between yourself and your sister.", "NTA. She asked you point blank, which means she had already figured it out, she was just looking for some confirmation. You kept your sister\u2019s secret for as long as you could, despite the fact that you weren\u2019t happy about it. But you shouldn\u2019t have been expected to continue to lie to your niece when it came up the way that it did.", "NTA\n\nShe already knew. She was asking a trusted adult for confirmation. You did the right thing. Remind accusers your niece is angry at the AH(s). Asking you to continue a lie you never agreed with is the AH move.\n\nWhat? Were they expecting you to make your niece feel like an idiot? *She knew*.", "NTA\n\nAhh OP I\u2019m sorry. You definitely did the best thing by telling her. You\u2019re being blamed now but really only your sister is to blame.", "NTA.", "NTA Your sister really shouldn't have kept this from her in the first place. Not your fault at all.", "NTA. You didn't tell your niece anything she didn't already know. The only question I have, is why she approached you? Did she try & talk to her mother & got rebuffed? Did she feel like it was something she couldn't easily approach her mother with, until she had outside confirmation & support? Neither of those things are your problem.\n\nIf your sister is upset, she only has herself to blame because she didn't take responsibility for initiating conversation when she should have.", "NTA - she should have been told the entire time. At the point you get asked point blank, it's not on you to keep some bullshit secret. She deserves to know. It directly impacts her life.", "NTA.  You did nothing wrong.  \n\nWhile I do have sympathy for your sister, she is definitely TA in this situation.  It is not okay to hid info like this.  Anna deserved to know the truth, even as a child they could have told her developmentally appropriate info about her bio dad.", "YNTA. your sister should have been prepared for this moment, and had all these years to tell her daughter the truth. even if you had lied, your niece is now a grown adult who can read between the lines. plus, it\u2019s not like you went out of your way to tell her - she asked you, probably because she knew she wasn\u2019t going to get a straight answer from anyone else. it sucks that you were put in that position.", "NTA, this actually happened to me. My oldest sister has 3 kids, the youngest has a different dad. My oldest niece asked me about her youngest sister's dad. I told her that I didn't know for a fact who my youngest niece's dad was, it was one of two people, one being the other 2 kid's dad. I told her the truth and she spoke with her mom about it.", "NTA.\n\nShe straight up asked you, and it was already clear as day. Asking someone to not actively tell something is one thing, but asking them to deliberately lie is going too far.", "NTA she is old enough by far to know the truth", "Well, it sounds like your sister had 21 years to tell her and didn\u2019t. You didn\u2019t bring it up\u2014your niece asked. NTA", "NTA - yes it was your sisters place to tell her.    \nShe had 21 years to do that and failed", "NTA. Sis left her child hanging for two decades; you told the truth.", "NTA.", "NTA, the truth was bound to come out eventually. Good thing that it was sooner rather than later. Besides, now Mommy dearest can explain everything. If she can be bothered.", "NTA. You were asked a question, one that your sister obviously has been avoiding. Keeping secrets is always the worst way to go, especially when the kids are really old enough to not have to worry about custody anymore. I would have done the same, good for you!", "I think NTA. She\u2019s a full on adult and deserves to know something like that. It shouldn\u2019t have fallen on you but she had already figured it out anyways. She asked you and when you told her to ask her mom about it she got mad and kept pressing. I don\u2019t think you messed up, I think her mom just should have told her sooner.", "NAH. She asked you a question that she knew the answer to but wanted confirmation. She\u2019s an adult and deserves to know the truth. But I also don\u2019t really fault her mother either based on the details provided.", "NTA. An at-home DNA test would've spilled the beans. The truth always comes out.", "Nta", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I think she was just hoping it would magically never ever come up.", "I totally understand that! Nobody told me that my dad wasn't my dad until I was almost an adult and it wasn't even him who told me.
