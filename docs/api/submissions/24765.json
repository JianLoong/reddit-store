Not in the sense that they are bad comments in and of themselves, but that the comments imply that, in general, you DON'T think people with disabilities are actually able to do these things, that you think this is something extraordinary or amazing for her to have been able to handle.   \n\n\nNow, as a generalization, the people that I've met with Downs Syndrome are very sweet and loving people who need and thrive off of this type of positive reinforcement and strive to please, but for a large amount of disabled people, it's not that way. I'm tired of always being told \"good for you\" and \"well done\" when people find out I'm autistic and also have 3 kids and a full-time high stress job.  \n\n\nI see that you said that you would have complimented any worker had it been their first day, or they were using a difficult new machine etc., but that's the thing. This wasn't her first day, and she wasn't doing something particularly difficult, you were just complimenting her on being able to do the basics of her job, which can definitely seem infantilizing if it is something that you have a habit of doing and wasn't just a one-time thing that anyone reading the room would have seen as appropriate in that moment.   \n\n\nBased on the other comments that I pointed out besides the \"well done\", I am leaning towards that being the issue. I don't think this interaction is necessarily wrong, but I do encourage you to reflect on your views of disabled people in general and see if there is more to this issue than you are realizing at the moment.", "NTA.

To this day when she says she did something herself with pride I confirm that it looks great and give encouragement.  If something is wrong I'll provide feedback so she knows, and she enjoys having that interaction. To this day my cousin has worked at various places that is appropriate for her to do so, she enjoys the social activities and earning how own money. \n\nThe waitress' job was to provide service and make coffee she was proud of that.

Because it's an achievement for him, he deserves to be proud of himself, and he deserves to know that other people see his achievement and are proud of him too. Today's achievement was that he stood in a queue in a crowded noisy room for 45 minutes without having a complete meltdown, after which he sat quietly and allowed his photo to be taken for his travel pass.

You're praising her for something *she* feels proud of.\n\nI have a physical disability, and I *hate* \"You do so well!!\" comments when I didn't ask, and I'm just trying to live my life, same as you.
