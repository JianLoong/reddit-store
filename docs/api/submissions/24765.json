Not in the sense that they are bad comments in and of themselves, but that the comments imply that, in general, you DON'T think people with disabilities are actually able to do these things, that you think this is something extraordinary or amazing for her to have been able to handle.   \n\n\nNow, as a generalization, the people that I've met with Downs Syndrome are very sweet and loving people who need and thrive off of this type of positive reinforcement and strive to please, but for a large amount of disabled people, it's not that way. I'm tired of always being told \"good for you\" and \"well done\" when people find out I'm autistic and also have 3 kids and a full-time high stress job.  \n\n\nI see that you said that you would have complimented any worker had it been their first day, or they were using a difficult new machine etc., but that's the thing. This wasn't her first day, and she wasn't doing something particularly difficult, you were just complimenting her on being able to do the basics of her job, which can definitely seem infantilizing if it is something that you have a habit of doing and wasn't just a one-time thing that anyone reading the room would have seen as appropriate in that moment.   \n\n\nBased on the other comments that I pointed out besides the \"well done\", I am leaning towards that being the issue. I don't think this interaction is necessarily wrong, but I do encourage you to reflect on your views of disabled people in general and see if there is more to this issue than you are realizing at the moment.", "NTA.

To this day when she says she did something herself with pride I confirm that it looks great and give encouragement.  If something is wrong I'll provide feedback so she knows, and she enjoys having that interaction.

Because it's an achievement for him, he deserves to be proud of himself, and he deserves to know that other people see his achievement and are proud of him too. Today's achievement was that he stood in a queue in a crowded noisy room for 45 minutes without having a complete meltdown, after which he sat quietly and allowed his photo to be taken for his travel pass.

That makes sense, I like it when customers or my superiors tell me I\u2019m doing a great job. I\u2019m bothered when they say hurtful or negative things. Why should it be different for other workers who have different abilities than me?", "Sounds like you dodged a bullet with your friend. What a weird reaction.

It\u2019s just an affirmative- they look good, I am content lol\n\nNTA the friend is the one who seems uncomfortable with disabilities/differences", "When someone tells me \"I made these all by myself\" damn right I'm gonna say \"Well done!\"\n\nNTA", "NTA I can honestly say as a parent of a child with down syndrome you did nothing wrong.

It was a perfectly appropriate response.  Your friend, while probably well meaning is overthinking it, and as others have said, going with a \u201cone size fits all\u201d approach, which in itself is actually somewhat discriminatory. \nYou\u2019re fine, you weren\u2019t condescending.  Not sure what to advise with re your friend though.  Show them this? Or move on ? \nEither way, all the best.", "No, NTA.

This looks like something a kid would make!\u201d \u201cSo?\u201d \n\nI teach teens with Down Syndrome and sometimes these people who insist they must be treated like they aren\u2019t disabled no matter what is kind of mean\u2014 all the time staff say \u201cIgnore! Ignore!\u201d when someone wants to interact in a way they don\u2019t deem age appropriate. Like one teen makes childish fart jokes and high-five games, I\u2019m told to ignore because it\u2019s not age appropriate. But he is just trying to interact and have a conversation on the level he can. \u201cOnly talk to me if it\u2019s age appropriate!\u201d really becomes \u201cDon\u2019t talk to me\u201d. Don\u2019t assume someone with Down Syndrome learned yesterday how to make coffee or thinks \u201cdown low too slow\u201d is hilarious, but c\u2019mon\u2014 don\u2019t respond in kind when that\u2019s the type of interaction they solicit with you?! \u201cCome back when you want to talk about the economy\u201d???\n\nSo ideally, sure, keeping out the well done would have been better, sure.

Get new friends.", "NTA at all for your intent, though it is possible that the way you said it (like your inflection or tone or whatever) could be interpreted as condescending. But as no one was there but you, your friend, and the server, none of us can really say whether that\u2019s true based on how the words left your mouth. Still, I have to wonder - if the server\u2019s reaction to what you said was positive, then it sounds more like your friend just really has her own stuff to work through.", "Uhhh,NTA at all. If you would have been smirking or rolling your eyes at the waitress as she beamed with pride,then your friend\u2019s response would have been warranted,but you reacted exactly the way the waitress was hoping you would and you probably made her day.

I would have done the same. She was clearly very proud of what she did, and rather than just ignore her or mutter a quick \u201cuh-huh,\u201d you acknowledged her effort. Obviously, we can\u2019t tell anything about tone of voice or anything else, but I didn\u2019t see anything condescending in what you said.", "NTA.\n\nIf anyone takes enough pride in their work to tell you about it, they deserve to be validated, regardless of their neurotypicality.\n\nYou were being kind. The world needs more people that are kind to servers.", "So why the duck is it your friends place to knowingly be condescending to you?\n\nNTA and as you said the barista was proud to share her work, you encouraged her. Your friend needs to get a grip.", "NTA. That was a completely appropriate response to what the waitress/barista had said to you. Ask your friend what you should have done. Stare blankly at her? Ignore her? Say \"thank you\" but very pointedly and obviously not engage with her declaration of pride in her work?\n\nIt would have been different if she had said nothing, you noticed she had a visible disability, and _you_ said something like \"Oh did you make these all by yourself?\" But that's not what happened here.", "NTA.\n\nThe fact she said \"I made these myself\" made your comment not only appropriate but expected. She was proud and literally asked for validation. Sounds like your friend has a hangup and was uncomfortable with the server.", "First off NTA but is your friend 12?

It was only aftershe left that she coild say something to you, via text?\n\nWTF is with this generation?", "NTA", "NTA. Complimenting someone's work is not condescending unless it was said sarcastically. I don't get that impression.\n\nDoes your friend have a relative that is special needs that would trigger such a response? Sounds pretty drastic to throw a friendship away over what sounds like a relatively innocuous interaction.", "Reading the room. Someone sounds like they are proud of something you are supposed to thank them for the effort and tell them how well they have done. \n\nKeep being you!", "NTA. Your friend sounds like one of those people who takes being an \u201cAlly\u201d a little too far.", "Without tone or being present in the context it's hard to be certain but my instinct is NTA - it's not like you presumed she needed complimenting on this, she led by insinuating she was proud of it and you engaged in kind. \n\nEither way though - blocking you is extreme?!", "I'm glad she blocked you.  You, nice and sweet person, do not need such a woke friend that she can't even fathom being helpful, kind and uplifting to another person.\n\nNTA", "Wow your \"friend\" has brainworms.", "I was so ready to read this condescending thing you said/did and vote Y T A.

Your friend is worried about appearances but it really doesn't matter because I can almost 100% assure you that no one else in the cafe took it as you infantalizing her either.", "NTA. Your friend sounds exhausting", "NTA. You were neither patronizing or superior acting, you merely pleasantly acknowledged the worker's pride in her work.

Your friend is very strange.", "The waitress was proud of her work. If she hadn\u2019t said \u201cI made these myself\u201d I would say your response was weird.

It was very nice of you to be kind to the waitress who was obviously proud of her work.", "NTA. Do not bother explaining yourself to your friend.

Positive reinforcement like that is very valuable, and as you pointed out, almost always taken well and makes them truly proud. \n\nBut also, I can see why your friend thought that. She might not have a lot of experience in interacting with DS, and on the surface, it can seem condescending. But she\u2019s wrong.", "NTA.  When has kind words been inappropriate? Never.

Giving a compliment that might have been a bit overdone but was, in all matters, heartfelt and supportive... Where does that come from : ''It isn't your place to congratulate her'' ??

He must trust you to have been able to do it.", "I can see your point, but given that this was specifically about someone with DS and someone who invited praise by saying they were proud of themselves I don't think this was a micro aggression.  If it was a different disability I would see it differently.", "I understand your point but regarding the first comment you highlighted, I think it a fact that a majority of restaurant/cafe did not hire workers with disabilities in the past, and a lot still don't. In this regard, it is great to see things change and that workers, regardless of having a disability or not, can thrive in a peaceful environment. Now I don't know if OP meant it in that way or the way you seem to have read it.\n\nI get how positive discrimination is still discrimination and that changing your attitude for someone because they have a disability can show that you think of them as different in a way. However I don't think that was the case with the interaction OP had since they said that the worker proudly announced they made the coffee themselve. It doesn't matter that it wasn't her first day. It is really basic social behavior to aknowledge/ congratulate someone when they are proud of doing something and decide to share it with you. Doesn't matter how simple the task is nor who the person is. If someone appears happy to announce \"I did it myself\", just congratulate them. Reacting with indifference would definitely not be a nice reaction to have, even quite awkward to be honest.\n\n>I see that you said that you would have complimented any worker had it been their first day, or they were using a difficult new machine etc., but that's the thing. This wasn't her first day\n\nThis was in response to someone asking how they would react if someone had said it was their first day, etc. Again, the main thing here is it is a __reaction__. There is a major difference between a condescending/ infantilizing compliment offered out of nowhere and a compliment offered in response to an interaction. Now, if it was OP habits to do so when it is \"unasked\" for, then it is a complete different story.", "You know what the interesting thing between that waitress and your diatribe is?
