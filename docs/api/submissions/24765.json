The atmosphere was lovely, and it was so nice to catch up, but after lunch she texted me about an interaction I had and said that it had made her uncomfortable, so I am coming to the internet for judgement.\n\nThe cafe was order at the counter, so I went up and ordered/paid for both my friend's and my food and drinks. Everything went the same as at any other cafe, and I went back to our table. A few minutes later, a waitress (F30s?) brought over our coffees, and it was clear that she had Down Syndrome. This was no issue, I think it is lovely that she is able to find work and is clearly comfortable in the cafe environment.\n\nWhen the waitress set down our coffees, she said to me \"I made these all by myself\" and was quite proud in her demeanour. I told her, verbaitum, \"Thank you, they look fantastic - well done!\" The waitress then walked away, and my friend and I enjoyed the rest of our lunch. \n\nIt was only after lunch that my friend texted me telling me that I was rude and condescending to the waitress, and she felt ashamed to have gone out with me. I was quite surprised, so I asked what she meant and she texted back, \"You treated her like a child. If she did not have Downs Syndrome, you would not have said 'Well done.' I think this was so rude and I cannot believe I have a friend who is so discriminatory.\"\n\nI texted back that I had no intention of being condescending, but that the waitress was quite proud of her work (demonstrated by her telling me that she had made the coffees all by herself), and I just wanted to congratulate her on her hard work. My friend just sent back, \"It isn't your place to congratulate her.\" and has since blocked me.\n\nI spoke to my husband (M30) about it, and he says that I did the right thing because I provided encouragement to the waitress, but I am not so convinced based on my friend's reaction.

The (ex) friend is salty because OP wouldn't have said 'well done' to someone without Down Syndrome, but the other side of that coin is that someone without DS wouldn't have announced their accomplishment!\n\nThe server was proud of her work, and OP encouraged her.

She needs to relax more around people with disabilities. \n\nNTA", "NTA. It's obvious that your friend thought that accusing you of ableism, would make you immediately feel ashamed/flustered,  and she expected you to just accept her accusations, and start apologising without debate. Then in that little fantasy encounter she'd built for herself, she'd get to feel triumphant and proud of herself for correcting you. It's all a low-key power play. But rightfully, you didn't apologize because you're not ableist. She got angry and blocked you, because you didn't react the way she wanted. You're probably better off without her. Honestly people need to stop taking offence on behalf of other people, who are not themselves offended."]}
