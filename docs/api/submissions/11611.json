We have been mostly estranged for the last 7 years. I say mostly because she has made some effort to stay in touch while I faded away. My dad died when I was 4. Mom and him were not married but they were together. She leaned heavily on my dad's family for a couple of years. Then she moved us away so she could start a better life for us. After moving she met John and married him. I was told, more than once, by John and my mom, that John was now my father and I was told to call him dad, refer to him as dad with others, and not to correct anyone who used the term dad/father. I was to correct those who said he was my stepdad. I didn't want to do this but I was punished and John yelled at me multiple times for \"disrespecting his love\" and I was berated and told he was stepping up to take me on as his daughter and the least I could do is to respect him as my father.\n\nWhen my mom gave John children, it became very clear he never saw me as his. I was treated differently. I was not given the same anything. Yet the rules remained in place that I call John \"dad\" and would get punished for any instance of not. Mom always took his side, always backed him up, always agreed that he deserved some kind of respect for this stuff. I still have some bitterness over this.\n\nI didn't want John to be my father but at the very least if I'm going to be forced to address him as such and to correct people who spoke the truth, I felt like I should have been treated better at least. But that didn't happen and I moved out the day I turned 18 and stopped speaking to or seeing my mom and John. She would reach out, sometimes I would read or listen to hear speak. But I felt good not having them around.\n\nNow John has been diagnosed with a neurological condition and my mom is caring for him. She asked me to come and help her. To help him. To help out their children. I refused. She told me she needed me, they needed me, and I'm their daughter. I told her I didn't care, I wouldn't help and after everything they had done, they deserved nothing from me. I told her she failed me as a mother and as far as I was concerned they were already dead and buried and nothing to do with me. She said I was being unfair, holding onto the past too much and lacking in compassion. She tried to tell me to think of the good times. I told her she failed me. She forced me to say stuff I didn't want to say as a kid in order to appease her husband who didn't treat me like his kid anyway. A family friend reached out after the disagreement and told me I should be ashamed and while they were imperfect back then, they are still my family and I piled on a woman who is doing the hardest job imaginable (caring for a sick loved one).\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678099007, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jvaa7/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_mom_now_that_her/", "score": 751, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Hard pass.\n\nIgnore the guilt tripping from her friends or her-you need to stay away from these people.", "Gigantic NTA", "\u201cLife\u2019s not fair, mom. Just look at what happened to me because of your actions! Don\u2019t bother calling me for the funeral\u201d", "NTA. And you have every right to be disrespectful to the family friend who has no business being in yours. Ask the friend why they didn\u2019t interfere while you were being abused as a child. \n\nStay strong. Get some counseling if you can to help you through. As you travel through life, you\u2019ll find friends are great family.", "Respect is to be earned, not demanded. If they had earned your respect, they'd have your help now.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nEven if they were the best parents ever, you are not required to put your life on hold to go help. \n\nShe's asking waaaaay to much of you and you are well within your rights to have and enforce your boundaries with her.", "NTA so sorry that happened to you", "\u201cDear family friend, thank you for your unsolicited opinion, however it will not be taken into consideration for fairly obvious reasons. Goodbye!\u201d NTA", "NTA. The family card is being drawn too late by your mother. Let her hire some help, if she needs it. You have been looking out for yourself for a long time. Just keep doing that. As far as I am concerned, you don't owe your mother or her husband anything.", "NTA.  Family isn\u2019t this magical thing that erases all their past misdeeds.  You reap what you sow.  \n\nI\u2019ve learned so much after family has let me down and hurt me thar family is who you choose it to be.  Some of the worst people in your life share your blood.  The best people in your life are those who you choose to be in your life, and who choose to be in yours.  \n\nTo go help them now wouldn\u2019t undo the hurt.  It wouldn\u2019t undo all the stuff they did.  That they EXPECT you to do this shows they don\u2019t care about you, just that you can provide something for them.  It\u2019s all transactional.", "NTA. Buy your mom the worlds smallest violin and put it in a huge box. Then send it to her. Tell her you're sending all the help you can.", "Big NTA!!! Stand your ground! You have nothing to feel bad about! Block all of them! You owe them NOTHING!", "NTA, and here's a response to everyone who tries to guilt you.\n\n\"He never treated me or loved me as a daughter. Why the hell would I see him or help him like he's my father? He doesn't see me as his daughter, ergo, I am not.\"", "NTA. Cut them off and move on with your peaceful, honest life.", "NTA - This is great news that the past should be forgiven because family, because then the mom should have no problem forgiving her for not helping her disgusting step dad.", "NTA. \u201cBut they\u2019re still family\u201d has to be the most toxic, bullshit statement to ever exist as an excuse for failed parenting.\n\nBlood does not make one \u201cfamily\u201d it makes someone a blood relative and means you share some DNA traits. It\u2019s biology. It\u2019s how you\u2019re treated that determines whether you see someone as part of your family. They didn\u2019t treat you like you are part of the family and so\u2026 they are not your family. Don\u2019t let random people with morals that should have died in the last century tell you how you should behave. You do you, and live your best toxicity-free life. \n\nAlso I\u2019m so sorry about your childhood, no one deserves that.", "NTA and the family \"friend\" who contacted you is despicable and should be ashamed of themselves. I'm sorry for what you had to go through at such a young age, bring cursed with a failure of a parent who put their own wants above the needs of a very young child. Truly monstrous behaviour on her part, and she deserves neither your forgiveness, nor your time.", "BIGGGG NTA. They sound horrible. Genuinely. Wtf.", "NTA\n\nPeople who want compassion need to give compassion. \n\nProfusely thank the family friend for volunteering to help since you are emotionally unable to support them. If nothing else, this tactic frequently shuts down people offering unsolicited opinions.", "NTA just say you learned everything from her and if she doesn\u2019t like who her lessons create that\u2019s on her.", "NTA.", "NTA", "NTA You do not owe them anything,  family can be toxic and it\u2019s ok to look out for yourself.  They don\u2019t sound like they would actually appreciate your help even if you went to help.  Especially since they are already scapegoating you.  I say stick to your guns and don\u2019t let them bully you.", "NTA... you have been gone a long time, and she reached out only when she wanted something from you.\n\nMaybe some day in the future you may reconnect as adults and as equals and discuss how what happened formed you and you can at least understand each other. Right now is not the time for that and you dont need to be involved.", "NTA", "Nta", "Exactly. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA.", "NTA she only wants to fix it because she wants your help. Keep things the same little to no contact with her and none with him.", "And ask where they were during her mistreatment", "NTA. Contact the family friend who tried to humiliate you and ask that person why they didn't volunteer to help your mother in any way they could.", "The axe forgets the tree remembers. Well, not entirely, the axe remembers that it lost some sharpness.\n\nGo get an apology from John. Then cut contact, tell them you\u2019ll get back in 15 or so years, that\u2019s how long they made you wait.\n\nTell your \u201cfamily friend\u201d they should be ashamed for not caring for an abused kid and they can go help the abusers, and then to eff off. \n\nNTA. You have nothing to be ashamed of.", "Its always the peoples who always had their way in the past who are saying dont hold the pas", "Yes and also: what past? I didn't see anything in the post that they changed anything about their behavior except that OP limited their damage by moving away", "Right. In fact the only thing that changed in the present is that OP stopped seeing them.\n\nThere's no reason to think they'd behave differently in the present than they did in the past.\n\nTime didn't wash away who they are.
