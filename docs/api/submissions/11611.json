We have been mostly estranged for the last 7 years. I say mostly because she has made some effort to stay in touch while I faded away. My dad died when I was 4. Mom and him were not married but they were together. She leaned heavily on my dad's family for a couple of years. Then she moved us away so she could start a better life for us. After moving she met John and married him. I was told, more than once, by John and my mom, that John was now my father and I was told to call him dad, refer to him as dad with others, and not to correct anyone who used the term dad/father. I was to correct those who said he was my stepdad. I didn't want to do this but I was punished and John yelled at me multiple times for \"disrespecting his love\" and I was berated and told he was stepping up to take me on as his daughter and the least I could do is to respect him as my father.\n\nWhen my mom gave John children, it became very clear he never saw me as his. I was treated differently. I was not given the same anything. Yet the rules remained in place that I call John \"dad\" and would get punished for any instance of not. Mom always took his side, always backed him up, always agreed that he deserved some kind of respect for this stuff. I still have some bitterness over this.\n\nI didn't want John to be my father but at the very least if I'm going to be forced to address him as such and to correct people who spoke the truth, I felt like I should have been treated better at least. But that didn't happen and I moved out the day I turned 18 and stopped speaking to or seeing my mom and John. She would reach out, sometimes I would read or listen to hear speak. But I felt good not having them around.\n\nNow John has been diagnosed with a neurological condition and my mom is caring for him. She asked me to come and help her. To help him. To help out their children. I refused. She told me she needed me, they needed me, and I'm their daughter. I told her I didn't care, I wouldn't help and after everything they had done, they deserved nothing from me. I told her she failed me as a mother and as far as I was concerned they were already dead and buried and nothing to do with me. She said I was being unfair, holding onto the past too much and lacking in compassion. She tried to tell me to think of the good times. I told her she failed me. She forced me to say stuff I didn't want to say as a kid in order to appease her husband who didn't treat me like his kid anyway. A family friend reached out after the disagreement and told me I should be ashamed and while they were imperfect back then, they are still my family and I piled on a woman who is doing the hardest job imaginable (caring for a sick loved one).\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1678099007, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11jvaa7/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_mom_now_that_her/", "score": 9183, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Calling courtesy respect, cheapens what respect means. Why do you think people dont seem to care if they are respected? Why does loss of respect matter when it meant nothing to begin with?\n\nThere is a second definition which is \"due regard for the feelings, wishes, rights, or tradition of others\"- but even that doesn't fit because I often don't have regard for these things if they suck. I don't like agreeing to have regard for things before i even know what those things are. Blind loyalty only allows people to further harm others by giving them an air of legitimacy because so many people \"respect\" them. I can still be courteous to the person, but I don't have to pretend their views are valid or worthy of respect. One could argue sharing these things is causing me to lose respect for them- but idk how you lose something you never had. \n\nThe reason I like making it clear that these are separate ideas is because people blend the 2 concepts together and intentionally (or sometimes unintentionally) misinterpret what others mean by respect. \"Respect your elders\" for existing is not what I usually mean when using \"respect\". Since they are the same word its easy for people to take the conversation around real respect and apply it to courtesy.

And the \u201cfamily friend\u201d is no friend of yours.", "I'm going against the grain here by saying both you and your mom are NTA.\n\nYour mom lost your father/her husband when you were 4 and obviously struggled with having a young child (or more than 1) and having to get her life back together.\n\nShe moved you away to try and start a better life and met someone new who was willing to take care of you.\n\nNow here is where the Assholish part starts on the side of your stepdad in demanding you call him dad instead of allowing you to cherish your own, and treating you as if you were less than the children your mom had with him.\n\nI think your mom is in a very dependent, semi-abusive relationship with him in that respect and has been struggling to stand up to him, especially since she already lost her first husband as well.\n\nWhat is important to me to read here is that your mother has been consistently trying to reach out to you for contact, even before this situation happened where she needs your help, but you didn't want it because you (probably rightfully) felt abandoned by her and put behind her new kids.\n\nI would say that if you can, be the better person here and realize that it is actually tough to not just be an adult, but also lose your first husband when your daughter is just 4 years old and having to restart your entire life without any security whatsoever, and that in her way, she did try to stay in touch with you throughout the years.\n\nIt's just sad all around really, and if you have a chance to now get over this and be there for your mother I would try to do so, I think karma wise and with regards to you not having any regrets when she eventually passes away as well it would be worth the shot. What is there to lose in that respect? It might be a healing experience where you can show her your strength and how you're willing to actually be there for her when she really needs it even though you feel she wasn't there for you when you did, as well as put you on equal footing with her so you can honestly ask her the questions you clearly have about the choices she made/had to make raising you.\n\nShow that you're the bigger person here.\n\nJust my two cents.", "NTA.\n\nMom & stepdad are TA.\nNo remorse, no apology, no support as a child (or an adult). \nOP, give them what they gave you\u2026\nNothing.\n\nGo NC & live your best life.", "John and OP only use family when it's convenient. They love based on conditions.", "I agree having been a caretaker of my grandmother for a few years.  Difficult work although i f the relationship is good, fulfilling. I needed healing at the time and worked out great.  Wit hthat kind of poisonous past, not even an option. totally NTA here.", "Spoken like someone who has never encountered a true narcissist. Oh, sweet summer child...", "Abuse is the correct word!  It\u2019s emotional and psychological abuse!  Absolutely the correct word.

But if that's his legal name that's his legal name.", "OP, I relate to much of what you wrote and here is something I read that gave me the most clarity on our shared misfortune \"We cannot choose our parents, but we can choose whose children we become\".  Seneca\n\nI am not heartless for \"abandoning\" my criminal parents when they needed something from me after the terrible choices they made - I have a right to my hard earned self reliance and peace.\n\nWhenever anyone (including my mother and father) say \"You only have one (insert blood relative here)\" I say \"And I only have one LIFE\".\n\nThe best part  since sending a legal No Contact Order, is I am no longer angry at either of them, nor do I wish them ill - I am just grateful they are not in my life any longer.

If he needs a caregiver, they should be talking with social services.", "Translation: She's used to you being bullied around the house. She wants to go back to having you bullied by his desires and needs.\n\nYour mother's husband has probably always been jealous of you.

I have been estranged from my mom because of my stepdad. 2020 he died of COVID. I\u2019m in my late forties. His granddaughter(my step sister\u2019s kid) reached out to me about the death and my mom.
