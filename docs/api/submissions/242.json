I was super happy and excited for her. She mentioned that she and her fianc\u00e9 weren\u2019t sure how they were going to pay for the wedding, since both their families have financial issues. I reached out to a bunch of people and gathered info on a bunch of these resources to send to her. I didn\u2019t do this expecting anything, only to help out a friend. I told her if she needed help with anything to please let me know. \nAbout a month ago, I saw she posted on a FB group asking how to wash and style her wig by herself to save money.(Many Orthodox women cover their hair after marriage, some with wigs, some with scarves, etc.) I commented on the post and gave advice on how I manage my wigs - I figured it would also be helpful for anyone who comes across the post. Rebecca then texted me and asked if we could meet up one Sunday so I could show her how to wash and style her wig. I agreed, but told her I work Sundays and probably won\u2019t be able to take a Sunday off until late November/December, which she said was fine. (Side note:Rebecca lives in NYC with most of my other friends, while I live 1.5 hours away. I try to see a bunch of people on the same day whenever I travel in.)\nRebecca sent me her wedding invitation in mid-October, and I noticed that only my name was on the invitation, not me and my husbands. I reached out to her to confirm that my husband wasn\u2019t invited, which was correct. I tentatively RSVP\u2019d yes, but I did inform her that I may not be able to come if that\u2019s the case - I\u2019m a new driver and don\u2019t feel comfortable driving in NYC, where the wedding is, and I\u2019m not letting my husband take off a whole day of work only to be my chauffeur. It would also take me 2.5 hours of total travel if I were to park and take the train part way. I did mention that if she knew anybody driving from a location an hour away from me(and 30 min from the hall) to please let me know She told me she wasn\u2019t sure who was coming from that area, then told me that to check with her in a week, and if a few people cancel then my husband can come. \nI ended up not checking in with her and just changed my RSVP to no 10 days later(3 weeks to the wedding). As I understand, the etiquette is that married couples are both invited. I know that it\u2019s her right to invite whoever she wants to her wedding, but I honestly feel slightly disrespected and used. While I would love to be there to celebrate with her, I don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s worth taking the entire day off of work. I didn\u2019t tell her why I changed my RSVP, just that I hope she has a wonderful day. Rebecca has texted me multiple times since about how much she is going to miss me.

Since you said finances were strained, I would guess that was the issue and she is trying to keep the guest list to a minimum.  Maybe she felt obligated to invite you since you were helping her with her wig.", "NAH - you can decline the invite for any reason and you don\u2019t owe an explanation.", "NTA. And don\u2019t bother telling her the real reason, she knows. That\u2019s likely why she keeps texting you to say you\u2019ll be missed - it\u2019s guilt.", "I think you're not really the asshole here. I would also, always, assume that my partner is invinted aswell. I hope she sees you as a friend who she actually wanted to invite and not only because you helped her out. I also understand your reason about the driving part.", "NAH \u2013 But, it also sounds like you\u2019re not being super direct with Rebecca, making it seem to her like you really want to be there when in fact you \u201cdon\u2019t feel like it\u2019s worth taking a whole day off work.\u201d\n\nINFO: if she told you today that you husband can come, would you go? If so, I think you should be clear about that. And if not, be clear about that too \u2013 so she doesn\u2019t spend a lot of time trying to figure out a way to accommodate him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's not at ALL the norm in Orthodox circles, especially yeshivish, for both people in a couple to be invited if one one knows the couple.\nYou're not an AH for not going, but that's absolutely not the norm on Orthodox circles for spouses to automatically be invited. Helping her gather info on gemachs and offering to teach her about washing and styling a sheital don't change that.\n\nWhat is your husband supposed to do at a wedding where he knows nobody? Just sit alone on the men's side of the mechitza?", "Honestly, at this point I wouldn\u2019t go, because I already made up my mind, and I don\u2019t feel at this point that my presence will make a big difference for her. And I definitely didn\u2019t phrase that as well as I could have due to the word count. If I had an easy way of getting there, it would change things. But at this point I would have to drive 1.5 hours just to get to a train in NJ, and it would then take me another 1-1.5 hours to get to the hall. It\u2019s a lot of travel, and would involve me taking the entire day off of work because it is a middle of the day wedding. I don\u2019t have a lot of PTO right now, and I need to save it for my best friend\u2019s wedding in February. It\u2019s not worth it for me to take the time off when I would have to spend so much time traveling to this wedding. I should also mention, \u201cRebecca\u201d also offered to plan my Shabbos kallah(kind of like a bridal shower/get together the last Shabbat before the wedding) without being asked, but then passed the planning off to another friend and went out of town that weekend, and last minute didn\u2019t come to my wedding. I absolutely do not begrudge her this, as she has her own life, but combined with the current situation, it definitely makes me feel that I won\u2019t be missed if I don\u2019t attend her wedding - specifically because she also knows that I don\u2019t have an easy way of getting there without my husband driving. I just don\u2019t feel as though it\u2019s worth me using my limited PTO.", "I guess it depends on the circles. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but everyone I\u2019ve asked, and I have friends from all over the spectrum of Orthodoxy, says that it\u2019s strange. I never said that I expected to be treated better/differently because I helped her, I did that out of the goodness of my heart. Also, my husband would know people there. I never said that he wouldn\u2019t.", "What exactly do you feel \"used\" about if you didn't expect anything special for helping her find gemachs and a tentative offer to assist with learning about sheitals?"]}
