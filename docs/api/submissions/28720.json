People are usually exhausted from not getting much sleep because they wake you up every few hours for blood work, vitals, etc.  it\u2019s necessary but it\u2019s exhausting.

I\u2019d specifically put the plants on the coffee table together so they were easy to access and I wouldn\u2019t have to move them around when I got home. They had enough light in my living room. \n\nFortunately the plant was within my weight lifting limit by then. It had been a 5 lb limit at first and then a 10 pound limit. \n\nThe weight from the plant messed up the foot pedal opening mechanism of the  lid. I\u2019d have to manually lift the lid and I was recovering from a preventative mastectomy and diep flap reconstruction due to a brca  mutation. So it wasn\u2019t easy to bend and arm motion was a bit uncomfortable.  \n\nI had to wait until I recovered a bit more to try to bend it back.
