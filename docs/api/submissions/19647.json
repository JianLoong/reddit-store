People into witchcraft and crystals believe a lot of things about those \u201crocks,\u201d and it\u2019s likely that she\u2019s crying because she put thought and effort into choosing a crystal that she believed would benefit your life in some way, and you shit all over that. \n\nAlso, I just googled portable iPhone chargers, and they don\u2019t seem that expensive. Whereas crystals can cost a fucking fortune. Even if all you care about in gifts is their monetary value (which is a truly terrible way to think of gifts), you should at least bother to find out if it\u2019s actually a cheap gift before bitching about the value. \n\nSo yeah.

You're also the asshole for being so damn materialistic. Some of those \"rocks\" out there are significantly more expensive than a silly iPhone or iPhone accessories. Additionally, each type of stone has meaning and significance that are special to each individual. She went out of her way to think about what kind of things she hopes you'll receive in your life and carefully selected a stone that would best represent all that- based not just in her spirituality but also her feelings that she associates with the stone. So not only might that \"rock\" potentially have monetary value, it has personal and emotional value!

Mainly because they rip so many parts from so many different religions and cultural groups that I find it semi-offensive. Like much of it is based on Celtic, Norse, West Africa, Caribbean, etc culture all kind of mixed together into one hippy bag. Which I mean fine but by acknowledging it as a religion (and not acknowledging the roots of the traditions which many witches dont because they believe its all from england or where ever that specific form of witchcraft was written) you are kind of diminishing all these other cultures because you are hiding their practices by co-opting them for something entirely different. Dont get me started on the whole christian Witch Craft nonsense (licking the devils ass and all that nonsense) which was not even subtle about what they were doing trying to destroy the religions (by saying all other forms of religion is pagan and witchcraft and attaching negative connotations to them it is much easier to stamp them out which is what happened).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBUT on the other hand the modern version does have alot of good messages attached to it.

Plus they can revive old stories which are going unheard which is a fairly large wish of mine. Because with more folk lore comes more stories and with more stories we have more templates for things like movies and tv shows. Like there are so many creepy/wonderful/suprising folk lore things which are out there which are so interesting but are dying out due to lack of interest (and partially due to this idea of commercial witches because those people who would have taken an interest are now going the easier more well documented root which can be considered as a bad thing though me personally I am really torn).", "Right?

A customer once heard me mentioning I was feeling stressed and overwhelmed at work and she brought me these stones that she said were linked to feeling more grounded. It was such a thoughtful gesture I got a little teary-eyed about it. I have no idea what the stones are and I don\u2019t exactly believe that rocks can do that, but it was such a kind thing to do and whenever I look at them I do actually feel more calm.

I get the \u201cdon\u2019t shove your religion down my throat\u201d thing, but\u2026. It\u2019s still a gift. I\u2019m just so confused that it\u2019s apparently okay to be mad about presents now. And OP comparing the relative value of the items. Like what?! That\u2019s not what gifts are about. And yeah a gift that has nothing to do with your interests is a bummer. But like\u2026. Yelling at someone about it? Plus\u2026 a portable iPhone charger doesn\u2019t exactly sound like a thoughtful gift to me. Hell, maybe the sister felt like she was giving back in kind. She most likely felt that the gift she gave was more meaningful than the one OP gave her. Like come on! A phone charger?!?!

Tell your sister that you're sorry for the outburst, but that while crystals are super-important to her, they don't really have any value to you.  Maybe ask a bit about what she believes (not to convert or anything, just because she's your sister and you want to know about her as a person).  Trust me, you want to mend this relationship--it's always good to have siblings that have your back in this world.", "YTA\n\nYour sister has different spiritual beliefs than you, you don't have to find them believable to be able to respect her beliefs, it's the most basic human decency you can give someone. It may be something goofy to you but when someone you love, loves something and its not harmful, why would you have a problem and even make fun of her for it? You're the only one here needing a reality check because life is not full of people who think and believe exactly the same thing as you. \n\nDo you normally give people gifts just so they can give you one of equal or more value later? I don't think that's how gifts work and I too would feel upset if my gift was literally laughed at. Your younger so you have time to pull your head out of your own ass, so try to be more accepting of other people or you will ned up the person being rejected, just like you reject your sister for who she is. Demanding a better more expensive gift is literally something your supposed to outgrow at idk maybe 9 or 10 years old.", "YTA. She's trying to do something nice for you. A simple \"I'm not really interested in this stuff, but thanks for the thought.\" would suffice. Believing it witchy stuff isn't any sillier than anything heard in churches, and you're an asshole for trying to put her down for a sincere belief practice.", "YTA - she didn't have to give you *anything* and you behaved like an entitled brat when you didn't get your way. You need to grow up.", "Yta", "YTA. Way to be a dick.", "As an enjoyer of magic and magical things, i agree with you on the rock part. She should've gotten you something you wanted, not something *she* wanted. But i mean who are you to judge? It's her hobby, and whatever she does in her spare time, doesn't really affect you, other than she might seem a bit wack. You were the AH in this situation. :(", "YTA. Witchcraft/Wicca/Paganism are legitimate religions and are even recognized by the armed forces and the VA - my gravestone when the time comes will have a pentacle on it. Also, \u201crocks\u201d can be very expensive depending on the type and size. I\u2019m talking $30+ for a medium sized piece of quartz. A phone charger is usually half that. Even a brand-name iPhone charger is usually less than some of my crystals.", "YTA.\n\nOk, you gave her a charger which can be bought at a 7-11, she gave you a gift that was meaningful to her and was either sourced herself or from a specialty store. You not only belittled her gift, you actively attacked her beliefs and her as a person, simply because you think she should have bought you something overpriced and meaningless that will end up in the trash dump in a short amount of time. \n\nThere is no need to mock her for having an altar, believing in a non-christian path or having non-atheistic beliefs, nor for wanting to offer her time and energy to make people feel better about themselves. Just because you refuse to understand does not make it ok for you to denigrate her online, in life, and certainly not to her face. \n\nYou should apologize to your sister for being greedy and rude. It's a really bad idea to piss off a witch, even if -you- don't believe. \n\nBtw, may you get the life you deserve.", "ESH.\n\nHi, I'm also a practicing witch and with that comes pagan beliefs and religions that predate Christianity. If you took the time to let her share her hobby with you, you might see it's more normal than not. Being a witch isn't about spells and rocks. It's a way of self healing and self preservation. It's what we call shadow work. It's her way of coming to terms and working through her self trauma and the way she perceives herself.\n\nShould she have gotten you a rock? No. She should have gotten you something you would enjoy. But to trash her beliefs and hobbies?  That makes you shitty.", "YTA\n\nShe sells hexes that you don't respect but you want the money she gets from it? Nice. \n\nJust make life easy, buy her a $50 gift card for her next birthday and let her know she can't spend it because you expect an equal or greater gift for your birthday. Then it can be a tradition of just swapping that card. \n\nShe has an altar, she makes and sells hexes, that's a wiccan, in other words, a witch, you just insulted her religion. That's super disrespectful.\n\nBeing that she makes so much more money than you, the difference between your $30 gift and her $10 gift probably doesn't really click in her mind because it's so minuscule of a difference.", "What are you, 8? You are honestly crying over what you got as a gift? Get over yourself. Way to completely disrespect her beliefs. She probably got it for you in good faith and was excited to share something with you that she is getting excited about. \n\nI\u2019m probably gunna get downvoted to heck, but YTA.", "YTA  I have a wife into rocks and minerals and they are not cheap. If you don\u2019t believe in it, who are you to tear her down. Is it jealousy that she makes more than you?", "So, absolutely YTA. I've kind of got to wonder if you laugh at everyone's beliefs or just your sisters? I've had relatives, more so after they learned I'm an atheist, send me oh so much religious paraphernalia, cards, and emails. Do I go into attack mode or laugh in the face of these relatives over their gifts? No. I know how to act like an adult, thank them for their gift, and move on. On a few occasions, I've tried to discuss why those gifts aren't the best option for me since I'll honestly never use them and usually donate them to various charities. I've honestly never commented about some of the cards, but one year, I was sent a 2\" thick spike through a business card. It was apparently meant to be kept in one's wallet so that every time you sit down, you're reminded of the pain that he went through on the cross. So, wow, I can tell you that it certainly made the rounds at my bday party (2000 miles away from family) with my Gothic Industrial Punk friends. We laughed so hard, but I was, and still 20 years later, still am mortified at that \"gift\".  To date, I've still not said one thing over that gift to my aunt and uncle. \nNext, I'm curious as to how your sisters beliefs in any way truly affect you? I'm not talking gifts here, I'm honestly and quite specifically referring to the \"She's even selling hexes and ....\" Who cares what she's selling, as long as it's legal and people are paying her money for doing it?!? It was those few lines where I literally felt your entitlement bursting through. You even went so far as to ridicule her over \"her conviction to her beliefs\" especially for (heaven forbid) selling things on etsy. Your extremely condescending remarks of \"she's even got an alter in her apartment\" was in incredibly poor taste. You may want to take a second to think why that was so important to slip in here. \n\nI am going to add a bit of a caveat here. I do believe that for things I mentioned above YTA. However, I do think that ESH over the actual gift itself. I'd even liked how someone mentioned that she herself was a witch, but would never gift someone a crystal, a wand, or a rock, if they weren't interested in it. I agree that one should always attempt to look at the person they're getting a gift for, and to buy things they'd like, and not gifts you'd wish they'd like instead. I was almost going to ask if gift was out of monetary reasons, but you'd stated she makes a decent income. So in those instances it's important to know the gift recipients likes. I'd actually almost gone a different way, leaning more towards you, especially after the spike gift I received. That's a Big Know your audience thing. (Although my aunt was hoping it would \"save me\") The problem then goes back to the line about \"I gave her an iPhone portable charger & she makes more than me\" remark. Gift giving should never be about how much you spent on someone else. It should be more about how much you like and know a person. You should always strive to stay within your own budget, although there are those instances when you splurge on someone. There's also a fine line between buying someone gifts all of the time and them only getting you a card for example. If you're always gifting between $50-$100 and they only spend $3 in return, then obviously it's time to reexamine how much you spend on them.  Maybe it's different in your family, but gifts should truthfully never be about how much you spend on a person so you demand they do the same. \n\nSorry, this is a long response.", "Wiccan here. YTA. Wicca and Paganism, which include witches, are legitimate and valid religions, as much as Christianity. Disrespecting another's religion is one of the worst things that a human being can do. How would you like it if someone were to say that stuff about your religion (or lack thereof if you're Atheist)? Wouldn't feel good, would it? It'd anger and upset you, wouldn't it?  So why would you do it to someone else just because she's of a religion that's different than yours?\n\nYou owe your sister one hell of a sincere apology.", "ESH.

Think it\u2019s dumb but keep it to yourself.
