Your sister didn\u2019t give you \u201ca rock,\u201d she gave you something that matters to her. Did you ask what the rock meant? People into witchcraft and crystals believe a lot of things about those \u201crocks,\u201d and it\u2019s likely that she\u2019s crying because she put thought and effort into choosing a crystal that she believed would benefit your life in some way, and you shit all over that. \n\nAlso, I just googled portable iPhone chargers, and they don\u2019t seem that expensive. Whereas crystals can cost a fucking fortune. Even if all you care about in gifts is their monetary value (which is a truly terrible way to think of gifts), you should at least bother to find out if it\u2019s actually a cheap gift before bitching about the value. \n\nSo yeah.

Additionally, each type of stone has meaning and significance that are special to each individual. She went out of her way to think about what kind of things she hopes you'll receive in your life and carefully selected a stone that would best represent all that- based not just in her spirituality but also her feelings that she associates with the stone. So not only might that \"rock\" potentially have monetary value, it has personal and emotional value!

Mainly because they rip so many parts from so many different religions and cultural groups that I find it semi-offensive. Like much of it is based on Celtic, Norse, West Africa, Caribbean, etc culture all kind of mixed together into one hippy bag. Which I mean fine but by acknowledging it as a religion (and not acknowledging the roots of the traditions which many witches dont because they believe its all from england or where ever that specific form of witchcraft was written) you are kind of diminishing all these other cultures because you are hiding their practices by co-opting them for something entirely different. Dont get me started on the whole christian Witch Craft nonsense (licking the devils ass and all that nonsense) which was not even subtle about what they were doing trying to destroy the religions (by saying all other forms of religion is pagan and witchcraft and attaching negative connotations to them it is much easier to stamp them out which is what happened). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBUT on the other hand the modern version does have alot of good messages attached to it.

She is taking peoples money in exchange for a non existent service, most people know that as theft", "You could also say that most of the people in mega churches don\u2019t feel scammed, but y\u2019all still whine about them. How is this different? The sister is a scammer.", "Booooooo. Have an upvote.", "Definitely ESH \ud83d\ude1c", "And penguins", "You also forgot about every toddler in the world.", "Maybe that's what my ex-husband was doing when he would take the neat rocks and other treasures I found on the beach that I gave to him to transport back to the room for me (men's suits:  pockets. women's suits: no pockets). We got back and I was like, \"Where are my treasures?\" and he was like, \"Oh, should I have been keeping those?\"", "Try a natural history museum. \n\nOr, if you can arrange to be in Tucson in [early-February](https://www.tgms.org/show)....", "Or, sigh, tossing them down sewer grates to hear them go splash", "Mr. Ambrose?", "Everyone forgets the otters. These witches and geologists get all the media attention for being \"humans\", whatever that means (:", "They hold hands when they sleep. They can have anything they want", "What does it mean to be a witch? I think different people mean different things by that. Sorry if it's a dumb question or not specific enough but I'm seriously interested", "Witch jewller your the reason my marriage didn\u2019t last you put a hex on it.", "Just another witch to burn.", "Expanding on this a little -- some people also view it as a sort of.... spicy psychology? Kind of like a slightly modified version of cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\nLike, the same example of rose quartz. For some people, by keeping it with them, it also functions as a physical reminder of a thought process. Rose quartz for unconditional love -- not just love from others, but loving yourself, and opening yourself to being loved. Every time they look at that rose quartz, it's a physical reminder. Sometimes if I've been doing a lot of negative self talk, I'll wear a rose quartz bracelet, and every time I look at it or remember I'm wearing it, I make a point of derailing any negative self talk and replacing it with positive and loving affirmations. Similarly, for clear quartz and dispelling negativity.. It's a physical reminder to shift my thought process and look less at the possible negative outcomes and more at the possible ways things could go right.\n\nI kind of go between \"rocks good energy yay\" and \"rocks spicy psychology yay\" depending on the day. \n\nSame thing for spellwork -- Like, burning the \"right\" incense and herbs and collecting the \"right\" ingredients and crystals..... Sure, it's all fine and great, but if you're not doing the actual mental and physical work, it's probably not going to go anywhere.\n\nThe example I like to use is job seeking. It doesn't matter whether you carry the right crystals and do the right spells if you're just sitting at home playing video games all day. The stones, the spells, the herbs... None of it means anything if you don't *also* apply for jobs and put in the effort in the physical world *too*. The objects and the rituals are all symbols to tell your head (and by extension the universe around you) that you're changing things up and embarking on a new path. Change your thoughts, change your world.", "Thanks, are there rocks with implicit powers or do you have to believe in them for it to work?\n\n Like if you hid a love stone in someone's house who doesn't believe could I make them more loving just by being near it", "Do they go hand in hand like most witches are Wiccan or are they mostly separate entities?", "I actually think it was a crystal not just an ordinary rock and they can be somewhat pricey.", "replied to the wrong person :)", "That's what everyone is saying, though. It's all about what it means to the receiver, and her sister knew she didn't believe it was anything other than a rock. It would be like getting someone a bottle of \"holy\" water.", "Most of the people saying witchcraft and astrology are stupid believe the same about christianity and islam and any other religion. If you need your spiritual beliefs for whatever reason, go for it, but there is no basis in reality and it's ok to be spiritual and recognize that.", "I agree that all religions are lies", "Very true. I was mostly referring to the umbrella term for witchcraft. But you are absolutely correct, all religions can have those that use it for scam purposes. \n\nBut Scientology is based solely on ripping people off financially and cut them off from outside family and friends.", "well considering giving rocks/Crystals is a big thing, what she did, all be it misplaced (you clearly don't deserve the effort it takes), was really sweet. you blow up and say her beliefs are fake, tell her to 'find a better hobby' then have the nerve to say you respect all religion. you could have said \"hey im not into this. this isn't the type of gift for me\" but you proved you're a crap human being.", "Okay but we dont know if thats what she was doing or not. OP clearly doesnt respect all religions.", "point taken", "I find people that compare values of gifts to be exhausting. I'll buy a person a nice gift. I'm not going to be upset if they don't return the favor or give me something cheap... That's not what gift giving is about.\n\nPeople that feel the need to buy equitable gifts are the ones that stress out over escalating gift giving \"wars\".", "thats true , i was trying to look at it from more than one perspective , but you bring up a great point . even if there was a possibility the sister didnt see giving a rock as religious it still looks selfish bc its more akin to her", "I think the best gifts are those related to shared interests... only failing that should you fall back to gifting something the person would want but won't get themselves.", "you raise a good point . i put more thought into it  after seeing what other people have said and ive reached the point that even if it was for decorative purposes it was still selfish since it aligns more with what she likes rather than OP", "We have a gorgeous geode (a rock with naturally forming crystals embedded in it) displayed in our house. It's about 2 feet tall, it's an amazing shade of purple. My wife and I are not religious (or \"spiritual\") at all, but the person insisted on throwing in a book about the healing power of various crystals and how to \"maintain their aura\" or some nonsense.\n\nI just enjoy geology. She may think of it as a religious artifact, I just think it looks cool.\n\nGranted, this seems like a different situation than OP's. I have this interest, and it's a really great example. It sounds like he doesn't have any interest and it wasn't an interesting rock.", "No? You can like rocks just for being pretty rocks. My mom collects rocks and it has absolutely nothing to do with spirituality.", "I can agree with that, but the specific response in this case with the added monetary context provided by OP puts them way out of line.", "One is a proselytizing media, the other is a personal expression on goodwill toward someone you care about through faith.", "ok but if you're an adult, have some grace and say thank you. She could have done better, but so could he.", "It could have been a type of geode that you have to crack open yourself. Those aren't abnormal and a lot of people think they are cool, paganism or not.", "[removed]", "Oh it was a literal grey rock, weird.", "And there's a polite way to handle that. In this case, OP was more pissed that it was a cheap gift and flew completely off the handle.", "Lol plenty of religious folks aren\u2019t any of those things. I was raised Jewish and was taught science and my rabbi was a gay man. Don\u2019t generalize", "And obviously normalizing gay marriage leads to people allowing to marry animals", "Lol what?", "where did it go tho?", "Could it have been a raw hematite stone or a raw lodestone? I\u2019m sorry that this is so random, but I\u2019m really curious now", "I don't disagree, on a philosophical level. But we don't know if this was a random rock from the floor. I don't particularly trust OP's total dismissiveness to have accurately assessed the situation. It might just be a random rock, or might not be, but they were definitely the asshole in their response. Not prepared to call the sister an AH, since op is not a reliable narrator.", "I would, but only if I knew it would infuriate them.", "Hard agree", "I have a \u201crock\u201d sample of asbestos as part of a rock collection.", "Yeah, maybe. Didn\u2019t think of that, to be honest. I just know I have some pretty expensive and high-quality ones.", "This sounds really entitled", "The OP makes it pretty clear that SHE believes in what she's selling, so she's not taking advantage of anyone. You're reaching so hard here it's ridiculous. I'm an atheist that is particularly anti-religion, in all it's flavors, and even I understand that she's not doing anything \\*wrong\\* here. It's say it's even WILDLY more acceptable than the multi-million dollar churches accepting donations from poor people. THAT is taking advantage of people based on their beliefs. This is just some random wiccan selling wiccan things to other wiccans.", "First, I think it's important point out that i'm an atheist and i'm anti-religion, in general. I don't want that getting lost here. \n\nIt's different because this is a single wiccan selling wiccan related items to other wiccans, while those \"mega churches\" are multi-million-dollar organizations that are literally preaching the words of Christ. However, if you've read the bible, you know that the christ actually spoke AGAINST those kinds of institutions, even going so far as to say that the rich virtually can't get into heaven. Instead, the good people of the faith should be taking care of each other, taking care of the poor and proselytizing love.   \n\n\nA company selling crosses to Christians that want them is VASTLY different than an obscenely rich 'pastor' telling (almost exclusively) poor people that to 'prove' their faith the need to donate what little money they have to that obscenely rich pastor.", "These were my thoughts exactly!", "Witch definition are you looking for?\n\nI'm sorry.  I couldn't resist.", "Nah, I don't fuck with people generally. Do no harm is a good rule, I am pro do no harm but take no shit. I mostly litter pick and scatter visually pleasing things around my apartment to remind me to meditate, etc.\n\n\nSalt is a vital substance to lots of witches. It can be used for protection, banishing, etc. My advice is that for your next marriage, to protect yourself from hexes, throw salt in the face of your jeweller. If they recoil and start shouting at you, you've identified them as a witch and you'll know to avoid their negative energy... plus they'll banish themselves from your life because they know you're onto them (it's not \"assault\", officer, it's a religious practice \ud83d\ude02)", "To absolutely anyone else with sanity they'll just see it's value as no different to a rock from the park. It's like those people who are obsessed with star signs and they give you a pet rock as a present or a flag with their star sign as if I'm suppose to care about that.\n\nIsn't the point of a present suppose to be about gifting them something they can find a use for or like? Or is it about making it about you and your silly star sign beliefs?\n\nI say keep that crap to yourself and enjoy it in your alone time...but don't expect others to be happy when you gift them a \"night moon owl soul healing energy crystal from the moon\" or some fantasy bs. If I don't believe in it and you know that then why gift it to me?", "Absolutely! I made my own comment somewhere, but it seems to have gotten lost towards the bottom lol. I do agree that the sister was tone-deaf in pushing her beliefs onto the brother, even if it meant something to her, but the brother was also tone-deaf in not respecting her newfound religious/spiritual beliefs.", "Either you make things up or you just met idiots. Let me clarify one thing; astrology&astronomy and witch craft do exist in Abrahamic religions. They're mentioned. In the Quran for example it's explained how magic was introduced to people in ancient Babylon.\nForbiding it and denying its existence are two different things.", "I still think its shitty to outright say that to someones face knowing how important their spirituality is to them", "K cool. At least you hold that same energy. Still doesnt give you the right to be an asshole to Pagans about it.", "Right? It's a GIFT, not a trade.", "But the worst kind of gift is: I had this thing lying around so I gave it to you. \n\nAnd I like rocks!  Especially shinny ones!  And I just got a rock as a gift- as a momento on a specific life event.  That was lovely.  \n\nIt really feels like in this case it was a thoughtless gift.", "So you would give ur sister a pretty rock for her birthday when its clear thats not something she\u2019d ever want?", "Sure, but that's why I'd call it an ESH situation.", "I mean as a Jewish person I feel it\u2019s very similar. I would feel very uncomfortable with a gift that is tied to witchcraft not that I think it\u2019s some awful wrong thing to do just that I don\u2019t. I\u2019ve had enough Christians try and proselytize to me that it would make me uncomfortable in the same way", "I'm pretty sure a JW would give a pamphlet as a gift because they care about the person, that doesn't make it ok.", "Christians who give out rosaries or bibles to people (usually) feel that it is an expression of goodwill towards someone they care about through their faith.", "you'd think the sister would have mentioned that if it was a geode though. To someone not knowing what to look for you would never be able to tell if a rock was a geode or not", "I'd like one of those, they tend to be so pretty", "I've never thought of buying unopened geodes as gifts, but that's actually a pretty cool idea. Thanks for this thought.", "Got my little brother one of those for his 18th (one of the big ones) and he fucking LOVED it!", "Hahaha god damn", "We argued and she took it", "Yeah but still, she\u2019s actively giving OP something she likes, not them", "\"I give gifts to infuriate my loved ones\"\n\nWhat a psychotic thought process lmao", "Do you really? Does it need to be kept in a protective container? Truly curious", "Its the exact same thing", "I totally agree that it was not a good gift! She should have got something OP likes!\n\nAll I wanted to say was that we should not assume that she just picked up a random rock from the sidewalk.", "Yes, but a gift should still be thoughtful and something the person would like, this gift was just a rock", "people gift things the receiver doesn't actually want, but the giftee thinks it's still a good idea - and their intent is usually pretty positive - literally all the time. does that make them assholes?\n\nedited formatting bc i think it was a bit clunky before.", "I don't think that was clear, seeing as how the sister has been doing witchy stuff for a while and OP still gave her an iphone charger\n\nMaybe it's a bad gift, but it's still a completely optional gift that didn't have to happen. You're allowed to not like a gift and explain that you value other things, but you can't be mad that someone got you something you don't like when they didn't have to.\n\nYou don't get to tell someone their interests are dumb and a waste of time because you didn't get the gift you want.", "If OP had accepted it gracefully and had a discussion with her sister in private, we'd be having a very different discussion, if at all. They way she reacted in the moment coupled with the monetary context provided in this thread is what makes her the asshole.", "Does it make flipping out and screaming at them until they break down in tears ok? Because that's the asoect were judging here.", "Considering OP's attitude, I doubt the sister had a chance.", "My bf gave me one for my 18th birthday and we took a 15lb hammer and broke it together on his front porch. It was SO MUCH FUN. Especially because you don't know what color you're going to get. Mine was absolutely beautiful pure white that made rainbows when light hit it.", "LOL", "Not being good at giving gifts doesn't rise to the level of AH, to me. Unless it's aggressive, an intentional fuck you. It might have been here, but op didn't suggest it was. Just that they didn't like it.", "To be clear, in this scenario, I'm giving it to someone whose attitude has earned them nothing more. I try to give good, thoughtful gifts that the recipients would like when they're, you know, decent people.", "If you can't see the difference between a person selling an item they believe in and a multi-million-dollar organization taking hand-outs from the poor people they're supposed to help then we have absolutely nothing to talk about.  Please, for your safety, remember to wear your helmet if you ever go outside and, for the good of all humanity, please don't reproduce.", "Yes I suppose she probably put some thought into it and thought it was a good present or of equal value but ofcourse she was greatly mistaken.", "Oh certainly they made an AH move though the sister probably should have tried to get them something they would have liked. So I\u2019m leaning to ESH. I love gift giving and finding something meaningful that the giftee would love.", "Never said it was. But giving a gift for the giver's benefit is rude, no matter what it was.", "I mean. It\u2019s not that hard to include a card.", "Actively giving someone a religious gift for a religion they don't practice is 100% an AH move. \n\nThe only reason you do that is to convert someone or \"save\" someone because they chose the wrong path. Either way its insulting or dismissive.\n\nIdk why you keep ignoring this point, its literally half of the post.", "This! Worst case, you can tell the story about how your sister gave you a rock for your birthday and laugh about it for years to come. That alone, is a gift.", "The attitude was after the gift, when the gifter had requested an $80 dollar item and then returned the favor with a religious rock found on the ground. I personally find it in extremely bad taste to give someone not following my religion a religious gift, especially when they put 0 thought in it.", "Exactly! To be honest I am sad to see how many people just assume including OP that it was just a random rock. It bugs my mind", "That's where the faith aspect matters. In the sister's mind she would be doing it for  OP, even if it's misguided.", "But the thing is it is just a random rock to all of us who are not part of that type of hobby or community. Even the people glazing over the religious argument...if you give me a bible as a present even tho I'm not religious and I don't read books I'll immediately think you are gifting a present that you'd gift yourself and not me as I hold absolutely 0 value to it unlike you.\n\nIt's just a random book as much as that crystal is just a random rock. Unless you have a receipt and the crystal is expensive like you suggested is potentially true then I'd forgive you for gifting something you'd gift yourself.\n\nAgain it's not about you. It's just a rock. It's just a book.", "No, she was doing it for herself because she knew OP didn't follow the same beliefs."]}
