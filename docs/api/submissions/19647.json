Your sister has found something she not only enjoys but connects with, that gives her a sense of peace and enjoyment, and just because you don't understand it doesn't give you the right to try and take that away from her.\n\nAs for the gift, you give things because you want to, not because you expect something in return.  It's very selfish to criticise someone's gift to you, even if you don't appreciate or want it.  Grin and bear it, be polite.  They made an effort, just because it wasn't something conventional doesn't make it \"wrong\".", "Yep YTA", "If you gave something away with expectations on what you get in return, you didn't really give it away.\n\nYTA", "\"I didn't get an expensive birthday present so I yelled at my sister.\"\n\nYTA, all the way.", "YTA.

You were AH.\n\n> I bought her an iPhone portable charger... she got me a rock\n\nThat is insensitive of your sister. She got you a gift that was nothing to do with your interests/wants. She was AH.\n\nAll parties AHs = ESH.", "YTA. Of course witchcraft is nonsense but that\u2019s no reason to go off on your sister, perhaps she thinks the rock holds some kind of value", " People have different beliefs. Your sister is one of them. She's given you what is likely a meaningful present (in her view). Sure you can be disappointed - you have different interests and expectations - but you could have addressed this without snapping and criticising her beliefs. And so what if she earns more money that you? That doesn't entitle you to anything.  So yes, I think YTA in this situation.", "YTA since it sounds like this came down to you being pissed about a birthday present. Time to grow up", "YTA grow up. Who compares gifts that\u2019s so pathetic. I don\u2019t agree with people calling the sister an AH as well, she probably put a lot of thought into your gift because it probably has a spiritual purpose, but since you are too good for her hobbies you saw it as a rock. Sad really.", "I\u2019m an atheist, but yeah, YTA here", "YTA. Some people do legitimately practice pagansim. If she gave you a 'rock' which I'm assuming was some kind of quartz, it was likely done with sincere kindness and acting the way you did was definitely a dick move.", "YTA \n\nand a cool rock sounds like a much better present  than something I can get last minute waiting in the checkout line", "YTA.\n\nIt sounds like you're more upset about her gift than the fact that she thinks she's a 'witch'. All kinds of people believe really, REALLY stupid bs. Your sister is just another one. If she's happy and not hurting anyone then it's none of your business and if you're so shallow that your upset about the type of gift that she gives you then that shows YOU have a problem, not her.", "ESH you shouldn't tear your sister down like that she can believe what she wants but at the same time she shouldn't have assumed that you would like something 'religious?' as a gift. I wouldn't gift my friends a cross just because I am christian that would be distasteful...", "I respect all religions. I just find it hard to see witchcraft any different from Scientology , they just seem scammy. So no I would not say this to someone of a religion", "It\u2019s hard to call it a gift when she probably picked it off the ground", "As a witch myself, I agree with this. Don't get someone a present you know they won't be interested in. I've certainly never given anyone literal rocks as gifts, even if they have been soaked in moon water or were taken from a power spot. (I keep those rocks for myself.)", "Thank you I think this is reasonable", "Nicely put! Totally agree ESH", "We should  not support stupidity.", "I\u2019m not sure what it was because she took it back but it legit looked like gravel", "this.", "If she\u2019s  selling fake hexes on Etsy isn\u2019t she harming people?

Unless they're advocating against vaccines or think that folks should do spells rather than voting, belief in witchy approaches to life is not inherently stupid.", "Its no different from being gifted a rosary or something similar.", "Well, for starters, they're not 'real' hexes because that's ...just...not a real thing. So, there's no literal harm being done. Also, I don't understand the concept of selling a 'hex' as they're not actually \\*items\\*. It'd be like 'selling' a prayer. Anyway, i'd be willing to bet that \\*most\\* of the people that buy these things are purchasing for the novelty of it, not with the actual belief of their effectiveness. And those who \\*do\\* believe, are likely just getting some kind of satisfaction for themselves, like a spiritual placebo. Either way, no one's getting hurt.", "If someone wants to hex someone else, and they get satisfaction from paying your sister for her services, there's no problem unless you think she's got magic that can make those hexes negatively impact their targets. \n\nYou don't get to have your cake and eat it too. Either it's not real, in which case someone is paying for something that makes them happy no harm no foul, or it's real and you're a jerk to your sister for no good reason at all.", "As long as it\u2019s not asbestos"]}
