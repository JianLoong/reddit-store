We\u2019ve been spending a decent amount of time together. We did not have plans Friday night so I met some friends for drinks. He called (we call at least once a day) while I was at a loud bar, I silenced it (which apparently sends it straight to voicemail) and immediately texted \u201ccall you in a bit!\u201d, as we were wrapping up drinks. 20 minute later he texts \u201cI\u2019ve told you how much I dislike you being dismissive with me.\u201d  I called him 10 minutes later but he didn\u2019t answer. He has blown up on me that I didn\u2019t answer the phone. I was in the middle of a conversation and it was loud, and to me a texting made more sense. He\u2019s not letting it go saying I should have answered saying I was with friends and would call him back. He has raised his voice at me about it and telling me how terrible it made him feel and that he doesn\u2019t deserve that kind of dismissal. AITA for not answering the phone and texting instead?\n\nEdit: he didn\u2019t know I was out (I shouldn\u2019t have to tell him everything I\u2019m doing when not together) and he didn\u2019t answer when I returned his call upon leaving as he needed to \u201ccool down\u201d. We did speak (yell?) about it later that evening and the following day for hours. I never raise my voice at him. He just can\u2019t seem to let it go. I can understand him being momentary annoyed that I didn\u2019t answer but it for it to blow up like this seems like a major overreaction.\n\nEdit: thanks for all the responses. He\u2019s making me feel like I\u2019m losing my mind. He also went off on me last Friday (and still bringing it up) because we were on the phone around 2pm and I mentioned maybe getting dinner that night and he said maybe then we went on to make solid plans for Saturday and Sunday. There was no follow up on dinner until he texted at 630pm (\u201cso no dinner?\u201d) as I was on my way to grab a bite with some friends. Note we\u2019re about 45 minutes drive to one another during traffic hours. He knows I eat early plus we made plans for the rest of the weekend, I honestly forgot about that little snipet in our lengthy conversation tossing around ideas. He called me and yelled at me in the car for a good 10 minutes while I was in the restaurant parking lot and continued blowing up my phone while I was at dinner about me dismissing him and making decisions for him. If he told he earlier he DID want to get dinner then we would have. I apologized for forgetting about that part of the conversation and for making the \u201cassumption\u201d that because we made plans for the rest of the weekend that Friday would be on our own. There have been other red flags than this but just another thing he won\u2019t let go. When I tell him I don\u2019t want our relationship to continue he tells me everything about my behavior that is wrong. I think I finally got through to him as he hasn\u2019t tried to contact me today! But yes, I AM DONE!!", "created_utc": 1673812847, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10cta9y/aita_for_not_answering_my_phone_while_out/", "score": 422, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This dude is wrapped in red flags.", "Controlling much?", "Do not doubt yourself. Listen to your gut, then listen to everyone on here and get rid of him!! \nGo read the main ploys of a narcissist, especially controlling behavior via gaslighting.This dude should have a red flag tattooed on his forehead.", "re: update: \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89", "This was an easy one NTA", "Glad you dumped him", "Nta", "Run for your life. If he calls you or contacts you in any way, don't react, except for to say \"please don't contact me again.\" If he asks why or says anything else, then just repeat please don't contact me again.", "This guy sounds like a narcissist and sounds like he\u2019s gaslighting you. Seriously, get rid of him as this could end up going in a very bad direction. \nTake care of yourself", "This was exactly what I was thinking - heaven love a duck, can you imagine how bad his behavior will be after 3 months or 6?\ud83d\ude33", "She should play this, loudly, and leave it on his answerphone.      \n\nhttps://youtu.be/pNcvmwxoK2g", "Gump it", "Momma do the gump, momma do the gump gump\n\nhttps://youtu.be/SxEINSBsbeo", "nta", "NTA.

RUN, RUN, RUN,  This guy is bad news.", "NTA\nI hate when people don't answer calls promptly but you had a good reason and acknowledged it in some form rather than entirely ignore it", "NTA. Holy hell, he's dated you for five minutes and this is how he acts? It's unacceptable now and it's not going to get better. Kick this one to the curb.", "Seems like these situations center on his actually knowing you and he won\u2019t be together that evening.  The dinner suggestion dropped and the conversation moving to dates for dinner after that may have been contrived.  \n\nDo you think he does not want to be with you every part of a weekend but wants you available by phone on a night off to see if you have gone out?\n\nMay be he wants you lonesome for him those times and is hoping to anger you into staying home, answering his call and assuring him that if you aren\u2019t with him, you don\u2019t want to go out or spend time with friends.", "NTA .

Do not believe him if he says he will change.  Do not let him talk his way back in.", "At least you had the decency to text him that you were busy and you would call him later on instead of just ignoring him for hours. >Update: I AM DONE WITH THIS JERK I was happy to read this update at the top. This guy sounds like bad news. Never mind red flags this dude has a billboard painted red!", "NTA \nI watch a lot of investigation discovery channel shows and you are describing every\nMan that ends up murdering or trying to murder their significant other. Please run. Leave him. 6 weeks and he\u2019s acting this way???? Yikes", "NTA! I\u2019m glad you\u2019re done with that idiot. He\u2019s a classic narcissist and gaslighter.
