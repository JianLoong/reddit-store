We go to a convention for pop culture in the north east, and C showed interest in going. So I reached out and the group was cool with him coming.\n\nI told him since the hotels are super expensive during convention time, we usually all share a large suite and split the cost, if he was interested in sharing with us. He agreed. I explained we usually leave Thursday night and come home the Monday morning, and this time would be the same. He acknowledged and paid his split.\n\nCome the months leading up to the trip, I follow up with C to make sure we're all good. No issues. The day we pick him up, he was surprised to hear we don't come home Sunday night. I had told him I mentioned that when we booked the hotel, but he was firm that I did not, and that I severely inconvenienced him since now he would need to call off work. I felt bad that he forgot, and offered him to back out and we'd reimburse him. He grumbled and called his job, who said it was okay to take Monday off. \n\nAnd I thought that was that. But no, almost the whole time, no matter how much we tried to include him in our road trip shenanigans, he was pouting. At the next rest stop, I asked him if he was okay, to which he said \"No this is one of the worst evenings ever. I was told last minute about coming home Monday.\" \n\nThis really upset me cos I was trying to make this an enjoyable weekend for all. And angry because I KNOW I told him. I spoke with my fiance, who said I was right and that I did many times, but to let it be.\n\nCome this morning, I just had to know if I did or didn't, and looking at the messages, I found it. Right under the hotel info. Said many times. I screen shotted it, pointed at him like that monkey in family guy and tossed the phone on him bed (he was already awake). He looked.
