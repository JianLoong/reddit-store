Our parents always compared us and favored which kid was doing better. I don\u2019t think they even understand what they were doing or how it screwed us up. So we competed with each other to get the best grades, the most awards, the better friends. We also sabotaged each other a lot. We went to the same college and it got even worse.\n\nWhen we were in college my sister got in trouble for dating a guy my parents didn\u2019t approve of. I thought it was a chance to one up her and I stated dating a girl M who my parents would love. We dated for a year and with pressure from my parents we got married.   Although my feelings for M weren\u2019t big in the beginning, they grew stronger over time. I can confidently say that she is the love of my love and I would be nothing without her. \n\nOne morning M started acting strange. She avoided me. Later that day she sat me down and said that she was sent an email with I had written about her. She showed it to me and it was screenshots of my diary. In it, I called M boring, weird, a bit of a loser and a freak. How I didn\u2019t want to marry her but my parents insisted. M said she thinks it\u2019s my sister and asked me to confirm.\n\n I called my parents and asked them to call K for a family meeting. I asked around and nobody else had gotten an email with my diary entries which was worse. K came over with her new boyfriend and I screamed at her for sending my wife my old thoughts and ruining our relationship. I called her a jealous psycho. K yelled back that I lied to my parents and M and they deserved to know. K\u2019s boyfriend tried to stop us from arguing. We got into a shouting match.

They had the exact same expectations for me and my sister. When we both got caught dating in high school, my sister and I got the same punishment, compounded because both of us liked toxic partners. She ratted me out, I ratted her out.\n\nMy sister did it to get back at me. It\u2019s been like this our entire lives. I got into a top program at our college so she destroyed the acceptance letter and I didn\u2019t find out until the deadline had passed to accept it. So I destroyed her senior project the next year.", "What we're not going to do is give the adult sister a pass for leaking OP's private journal writings to his wife. Regardless of the contents, she knowingly sent that to instigate problems for OP. There is no way that kind of purposefully malicious action can just be swept under the rug like it wasn't the catalyst for this entire situation occurring.", "Doesn\u2019t really work if I\u2019m being honest.

All your wife sees right now that you lied and manipulated your relationship, including her, to *spite your sister*, not out of some genuine attraction. How is she actually supposed to believe you that your feelings are genuine now? How does that erase the harm you originally did and honestly continued to do by not being honest with her? It's frankly concerning and seems incredily immature and selfish on your part that you can't empathize with how big of a blow this most likely is to your wife personally and also to the trust she had in you and your relationship.\n\nThe problem here isn't that your sister is possibly still the competitive person she was as a youth, but that you don't see how this situation is a direct consequence of your own on-going actions.", "The foundation of your relationship is built on a literal lie.

I mean I think IF both parties are aware from the onset, maybe. She had to be blindsided. He used her to be the wife he knew his parents would approve of. She was totally unaware. How can she trust him? I mean just an opinion, but I think the deception is going to be hard for her to get over.

Not a trophy, not a way to win points. Ugh", "No, this marriage is over, you just can\u2019t see it yet. It may die an agonisingly slow death, but there\u2019s no coming back from this.", "That does not matter. You married her to get back at your sister, your sister revealed that truth to her to get back at you. It doesn\u2019t matter that you now love her, the truth is you led her to believe you did when you didn\u2019t. The beginning of your relationship was based on lies, rivalry and pettiness and she absolutely did not deserve that. That kind of betrayal runs deep.", "Changes nothing. You deceived her. You were not honest about the reasons you were either dating her or later marrying her. \n\nThis isn't a simple case of shattered trust. Her entire marriage is based on a lie, and that lie is about your motive to get into the marriage. \n\nWhat you did to her is unforgivable.

I was rude about you, and I was only dating you to stick it to my sister because I knew my parents would approve of you, and it was a chance for me to one-up her.\n\nit was fucked up and I did it because we were brought up in a fucked up household where our parents pitted us against each other. I've been getting therapy for this, because I don't want to be that person anymore, and the more I spent time with you the more I started to love you. I know now that you're the love of my life. \n\nI know you probably feel hurt and betrayed because our relationship was founded on a lie. The thing is, you're the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I'm incredibly sorry that I used you to get at my sister. \n\nIt was incredibly shitty of me to use you to get my parents' attention. You probably feel devastated, and might be wondering if I still love you, and if you can keep loving me. \n\nWhatever happens, I'm going to spend the rest of my life trying to make you see that what I feel for you is genuine. I'm sorry for the way I treated you, and I hope that we can move forward. I'd like us to get couples' therapy so we can talk through this in an atmosphere where you feel supported.\"\n\n? Would you have told her you were just using her to get your parents' approval and punch down at your sister, and tried to make amends, or would you have let her go on believing your relationship didn't begin in lies and deception? \n\nESH except your poor wife, who now knows she was just a pawn in the ridiculous games you and your sister are playing, instead of being adults and saying \"hey, this is fucked up, let's stop being the enemies our parents made us be.\"\n\nCut your sister off if she doesn't want to be a mature adult.

Why for the lovs of god are you still in contact with her? She sabotaged your career, how do you ever recover from it?

But I\u2019m not my wife and she would never do anything like this", "I won't say you're wrong on the deception front, especially now that she's been made aware of his previous feelings; however, it was clear that their relationship was on the up and up and that OP's feelings clearly changed from convenience to genuine affection in time. I've gone through this thread and read a lot of comments - it just frustrates me how many people are giving a pass or just brushing over the fact that his sister went out of her way to do serious damage to his marriage; that's without even mentioning the invasion of privacy for reading OP's journal.\n\nMaybe I'm just the odd one out, but I see the sister's actions as abhorrent compared to what OP wrote; OP may not have had good intentions in the beginning and wrote some shitty stuff, but people are capable of growing and changing. What his sister did has likely irreparably damaged the relationship, so it's hard for me to agree that everyone sucks because his sister did something so intentionally malicious that it outweighs comments written in the past in private.\n\nI think my vote is that OP is NTA, but I do understand why a lot of people are saying ESH.", "My wife thinks I\u2019m pretty", "> 1) Don\u2019t know their partners ( arranged marriages) 2) Don\u2019t love their partners( marriages of convenience) and it was pretty common for people to get married to make life easier for those widowed( years ago) \n\nThere is nothing inherently wrong with any of these... as long as both parties are aware and consenting. \n\nThat's not what happened here.
