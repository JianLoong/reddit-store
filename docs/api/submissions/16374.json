Our parents always compared us and favored which kid was doing better. I don\u2019t think they even understand what they were doing or how it screwed us up. So we competed with each other to get the best grades, the most awards, the better friends. We also sabotaged each other a lot. We went to the same college and it got even worse.\n\nWhen we were in college my sister got in trouble for dating a guy my parents didn\u2019t approve of. I thought it was a chance to one up her and I stated dating a girl M who my parents would love. We dated for a year and with pressure from my parents we got married.   Although my feelings for M weren\u2019t big in the beginning, they grew stronger over time. I can confidently say that she is the love of my love and I would be nothing without her. \n\nOne morning M started acting strange. She avoided me. Later that day she sat me down and said that she was sent an email with I had written about her. She showed it to me and it was screenshots of my diary. In it, I called M boring, weird, a bit of a loser and a freak. How I didn\u2019t want to marry her but my parents insisted. M said she thinks it\u2019s my sister and asked me to confirm.\n\n I called my parents and asked them to call K for a family meeting. I asked around and nobody else had gotten an email with my diary entries which was worse. K came over with her new boyfriend and I screamed at her for sending my wife my old thoughts and ruining our relationship. I called her a jealous psycho. K yelled back that I lied to my parents and M and they deserved to know. K\u2019s boyfriend tried to stop us from arguing. We got into a shouting match. My parents are furious with us both and banned us from speaking about what happened but I think I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.
