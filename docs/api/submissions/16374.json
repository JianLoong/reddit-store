It started off as a self therapy thing but it works. I don\u2019t write in it every day. \n\nMy sister K (25F) and I don\u2019t have the best relationship. We were both competitive kids. Our parents always compared us and favored which kid was doing better. I don\u2019t think they even understand what they were doing or how it screwed us up. So we competed with each other to get the best grades, the most awards, the better friends. We also sabotaged each other a lot. We went to the same college and it got even worse.\n\nWhen we were in college my sister got in trouble for dating a guy my parents didn\u2019t approve of. I thought it was a chance to one up her and I stated dating a girl M who my parents would love. We dated for a year and with pressure from my parents we got married.   Although my feelings for M weren\u2019t big in the beginning, they grew stronger over time. I can confidently say that she is the love of my love and I would be nothing without her. \n\nOne morning M started acting strange. She avoided me. Later that day she sat me down and said that she was sent an email with I had written about her. She showed it to me and it was screenshots of my diary. In it, I called M boring, weird, a bit of a loser and a freak. How I didn\u2019t want to marry her but my parents insisted. M said she thinks it\u2019s my sister and asked me to confirm.\n\n I called my parents and asked them to call K for a family meeting. I asked around and nobody else had gotten an email with my diary entries which was worse. K came over with her new boyfriend and I screamed at her for sending my wife my old thoughts and ruining our relationship. I called her a jealous psycho. K yelled back that I lied to my parents and M and they deserved to know. K\u2019s boyfriend tried to stop us from arguing. We got into a shouting match. My parents are furious with us both and banned us from speaking about what happened but I think I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.

OP, you should go NC with your sister and then sit with your wife and tell her that you love her and that it was a really old thought and about what your life was like when growing up, maybe do couples counseling. Also, go LC/NC with your parents. They messed you and your sister up with the \"favoritism.\"", "NTA - Holy crap is your sister psychotic. First, a diary is a healthy way to vent emotions, and I would explain that to your wife. You used it to voice stronger emotions, like anger, frustrations, and doubt. Second, your sister absolutely deserved to be put in her place. You guys are adults. Why is she trying to still compete? Why did she feel the need to literally sabotage your relationship over personal thoughts?\n\nYour parents suck. Not talking about this, means that no sides get heard and it breeds resentment. Honestly, I would work hard on reassuring your wife that you love her more than anything else in the world and I would go NC with your parents and sister until they understand the gravity of what your sister did and why she did it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
