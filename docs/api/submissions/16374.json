Our parents always compared us and favored which kid was doing better. I don\u2019t think they even understand what they were doing or how it screwed us up. So we competed with each other to get the best grades, the most awards, the better friends. We also sabotaged each other a lot. We went to the same college and it got even worse.\n\nWhen we were in college my sister got in trouble for dating a guy my parents didn\u2019t approve of. I thought it was a chance to one up her and I stated dating a girl M who my parents would love. We dated for a year and with pressure from my parents we got married.   Although my feelings for M weren\u2019t big in the beginning, they grew stronger over time. I can confidently say that she is the love of my love and I would be nothing without her. \n\nOne morning M started acting strange. She avoided me. Later that day she sat me down and said that she was sent an email with I had written about her. She showed it to me and it was screenshots of my diary. In it, I called M boring, weird, a bit of a loser and a freak. How I didn\u2019t want to marry her but my parents insisted. M said she thinks it\u2019s my sister and asked me to confirm.\n\n I called my parents and asked them to call K for a family meeting. I asked around and nobody else had gotten an email with my diary entries which was worse. K came over with her new boyfriend and I screamed at her for sending my wife my old thoughts and ruining our relationship. I called her a jealous psycho. K yelled back that I lied to my parents and M and they deserved to know. K\u2019s boyfriend tried to stop us from arguing. We got into a shouting match.

She very likely won't even consider your marriage valid and thus, she'll be free to end it because it never really started.", "Wow! Then maybe you shouldn\u2019t have dated her just to one up your sister. Like it\u2019s *your fault* she\u2019s sad.", "A lot of people don't believe in divorce until they find themselves miserable and trapped in a dead marriage.", "I know a few people who \u201cdidn\u2019t believe in divorce\u201d until it was their own shitty marriage they were shackled in. All those people ended up divorced despite their previous beliefs on it.", "You're hoping she wouldn't leave you. But she's just learnt that the foundation of your marriage is built on your desire to spite your sister and compete for your parents approval, that's going to hurt. And the way she views your marriage is not going to be the same. Whether or not you love her now, none of that matters you went into your marriage looking at her as a means of one upmanship, she likely went up the aisle in love with you whilst you were thinking so lowly of her.\n\nShe deserved to walk up that aisle to someone truly in love with her, who thought the world of her. And at the time you didn't, that's what this is about. She deserved much better treatment.\n\nYou need to go to therapy because the list of casualties from your parents toxicity is going to continue to grow if you don't start seeing them as the real problem here instead of your sister.", "I bet she also used to believe her husband loved her since day 1, but that changed too. I\u2019d start packing if I were you.", "The sister is a complete jerk! This is seriously lousy. Couldn\u2019t agree more. And yes, she did go out of her way to ruin a marriage and hurt a person who had nothing to do with the lifelong toxicity the parents caused! I hope OP CAN work it out if he truly appreciates his wife now. It may take some patience and time. If I were OP, I would go NC from sister and parents too. IMHO, they will NEVER bring him and his wife anything but heartbreak, as has been proven.", "I think OP is N T A for what he asked in the title alone. What his sister did was really fucking shitty and I would be *furious* at my SIL if she did this. Even if she had the best intentions (which she clearly didn't).\n\nWhile I can't be sure I wouldn't be upset if my SO insulted me in his private diary, I would try to be understanding because that is what they're for. We've both been through the therapy route, so I get it.\n\nBut I would be extremely hurt to find out that the only reason they were with me was because I was a pawn in their shitty game. That's a song that can't be unsung.\n\nAnd that's where people are finding issue. Even if OP loves them now, there was no guarantee that would have happened, but they got married anyway. The wife (I assume) fell for him believing he was honest with his feelings from the beginning.\n\nHow do you move on from that without major trust issues? How do you move on and not question every single thing they do or say after that?", "> She\u2019s so precious to me.\n\nWhy would anybody believe this statement? You dated and married someone you didn\u2019t like or respect.", "I mean you built your relationship on a lie. Your wife has no reason to believe you now. YTA and need serious help", "Pretty spineless..", "That's right. She deserves better than you.", "You literally tricked her into marrying you. You used her for your personal gain. You led her to believe you loved her when you did not. She made a lifelong commitment based on a lie.\n\nNot only did you do that to her back then, but you fully planned to never tell her the truth. Which I get thats not really something you can reveal later, but you still have to recognize that the fact that you deceived her and never intended to tell her the truth, must be a giant glaring red flag to her. \n\nIf you want any hope of salvaging this, you have to be proactive. Not wait for her to come to you or tell you how to make her feel better. \n\nWhen I locked myself away during my first marriage, I was mentally preparing to leave. Space didn\u2019t fix things.", "No they still compare our careers and how much time we spend with them and all that but it still changes who\u2019s the favorite day by day. Right now we both embarrassed them by screaming in front of K\u2019s boyfriend", "I did like her. My diary is just a place for me to vent. It\u2019s a lot of extreme negative emotions.\n\nI love my wife now.", "Yeah obviously", "Very true. This is what I'm thinking. It's very apparent that OP's sister is WAY messed up to even go to this extreme to continue some messed up childhood rivalry started by their even more dysfunctional parents. Why OP would even continue a relationship with the sibling or the parents is beyond me. \n\nHonestly, if I were his wife and this is the way things started for us, I would not stay if he wanted his parents or sister in our lives. The elimination of deep seated need for their approval might make me believe that he was halfway sincere about his feelings now.\n\nNotice that OP didn't say that the parents flipped out at sister for potentially hurting their DIL nor did they reflect that their poor parenting might have created this disaster. No, they were embarrassed by the perception that the boyfriend would have of the family. This shows that the toxicity is still there and they are probably still pitting the sister against OP. 'After all, he IS married, why is she an old maid?'", "I adore her. I bought her a house, I take her on trips around the world, I get her gifts", "Yes. I mentioned this post to my husband (he's a lawyer, although not specializing in divorce), and he said this is grounds for alleging fraud.\n\nHe says in the US, a marriage of longer than a couple of years and where one of the spouses claims to love and want to receive counseling would hardly ever be annulled, so it wouldn't be worth trying (just go for divorce in that case). Still, it's exactly the type of figure that fits the label of fraud because \"the misrepresentation from one of the spouses is directly linked to the defrauded party's decision to contract marriage.\" In this case, he says, the woman decided to get married/accepted OP's proposal to marriage because he misrepresented himself as someone who wanted to marry her out of love and the proposal of marriage as one motivated by love. She has proof that this was false on OP's part. As she wouldn't have gotten married under the real circumstances (so OP could win one over his sister), it's an argument that OP committed fraud.\n\nQuite sad.", "I won\u2019t leave her alone anymore", "Dude your parents are totally toxic.  Pitting children against each other is incredibly unhealthy and horrible parenting.  It's amazing they expected you both to act like rational adults to each other when they've basically encouraged you to hate each other", "Have you pointed out to your parents that they\u2019re awful behavior has made what should have been a close sibling bond into a terrible dynamic?", "\"Now\"..... it doesn't make it ok! Like she wore you down and you won the sibling competition so go you! \nI know I'm being emotional but gosh I feel so devastated for M. She's so lovely she's become withdrawn and still respecting your feelings when she has every right to go off at you, scream and leave. You don't deserve her.", "There you go. The wife has NOT one of her in-laws who show any interest in her feelings. I don\u2019t see how she can get past the way she has been treated. Sounds like a nice person who took the marriage seriously and I think she deserves so much better!", "I, I, I, I, I \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHours and hours of you talking about yourself. \n\nAlso, houses, trips and gifts aren't love. And they don't make up for deceiving a woman into marriage.", "None of this will ever look like it came from feelings of love. Everything you\u2019ve ever done / will do will look like some tactic to make yourself look good . The true motives will be so hard to believe for anything and everything.", "Easily Manipulated \u2248 easily trusting of people , it's the same thing but in a polite way .", "Thank you! I mean I seriously think he married her for all the wrong reasons. She thought he felt totally different. I feel so bad for her. It is more like he feels bad he got caught than feels badly he used her to one up his sister. I instantly felt so bad for the wife. Totally blameless here and basically used:( Absolutely sad!", "Does she want you to leave her alone? Because her opinion is the only one that actually matters here.", "I'm just imagining the two of them sitting on a couch munching on popcorn while OP and his sister go at it.", "Of course it won\u2019t look like it came from love. \n\nHe bought the house to be better than the sister. He took the trips to be better than the sister. The wife came along because it was expected & the fact he\u2019s married makes him better than the sister.\n\nThat\u2019s what it looks like. He _got married_ to win whatever pissing match they had.", "Trusting and manipulated is not the same thing", "It's called trust when the other person doesn't have ulterior motive , but when they trust you and you manipulate them it'scalled being manipulated as they failed to see what'sreally behind the mask , that's how it works , eg: your wife thought you loved her and that's why you married her not because you wanted to make your sister look like a loser and gain few good-boy points from your parents ."]}
