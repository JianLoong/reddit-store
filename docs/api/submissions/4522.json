{"id": 4522, "submission_id": "zjfi6d", "title": "AITA for asking my friend not to cook beef burgers in my home?", "selftext": "Tl;dr: My lifelong friend brought her new SO to my place for a weekend stay. She brought animal products into my home despite knowing I don't allow them inside my house.\n\nI [29F] have been friends with Jane [29F] for most of my life. She is like a sister to me. Jane is not vegan but my family and I are. My mother is especially strict about animal products being brought into the house and I share her values. This has never been an issue and Jane and her family have always been accommodating and mindful of this. Obviously Jane was welcome to wear whichever clothes she wanted in our home but my mom asked that if she wanted to eat at ours, that she ate our meals or if she wanted to bring snacks that they were free of animal products. This was never an issue.\n\nFast forward to last weekend. Jane has recently started dating Brian [34M]. They live about three hours away from me so I offered to host them for the weekend. They arrived late on Friday and I had already cooked and had dinner ready. They both seemed happy with the food. However the morning after I wake up and they are gone. I message Jane and she tells me they left to get groceries. I thought it was a little weird since my fridge was packed but didn't question it. When they came back I see that they have brought beef burgers and expected to be able to cook them for lunch. I was a bit surprised and asked Jane if she had forgotten about my rule. She sheepishly admits that no, she hadn't. She just didn't think I would mind this one time. Brian is one big question mark.\n\nI thought about dropping it but it made me uncomfortable. Not just because I don't like the food myself but because she went behind my back and put me in an awkward position with her new partner. I pulled her aside and told her as much and she begged me to drop it. Turns out she hadn't told Brian about my boundaries on this because \"they are embarrassing\". I reiterated that the boundaries were still in place and kindly asked her to not cook the food in my home. I offered to go out and get plant based burgers instead but she doubled down and called me a weirdo and stuck up. This was a shock to me because never in my 20+ years of knowing her has she ever mentioned this being an issue and tbh her words hurt. I told her to please pack her stuff and leave.\n\nShe stormed off and told Brian they were leaving. She later texted me calling me an asshole for embarrassing her. Brian, bless his heart, had absolutely no idea about what was going on. I don't blame him for bringing the food into my house but Jane should've know better.\n\nI feel bad about the fight. I know my rules are not conventional and likely feel strange and inconvenient to those who have different dietary requirements. With that said, no one is forced to stay at my house and my boundaries are clear. I don't know if I should've dropped this or not.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670803262, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjfi6d/aita_for_asking_my_friend_not_to_cook_beef/", "score": 84, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And when I did cook something at home I did it while he wasn\u2019t there and always used separate pans to do it. How disgusting it would have been to him. I would never have disrespected him in that way! And guests should be even more respectful! It was his home and his decision.", "NTA but I do just want to introduce another potential aspect of this situation that no one seems to have brought up yet. How much do you know about this Brian? Have you ever met him before? What do you know about their relationship? \n\nBecause my first thought was that there might be some serious red flags with Brian. If Jane has respected your household rules with no issues for nearly three decades and suddenly brings meat for Brian, then logic would tell us that Brian is the problem since he is the only change to the situation. Maybe he\u2019s the type to get violent or angry when told he can\u2019t have something, and Jane decided it would be easier to piss you off rather than him because of the potential emotional or physical consequences of saying no to him. \n\nI\u2019m not saying that Jane is definitely in an abusive or unhealthy relationship or it\u2019s unquestionably Brian\u2019s fault. But i think anyone who has seen a friend slowly become a different person after dating a guy who seemed perfectly charming on the outside but was a monster underneath, if you really care about Jane you should at least consider this possibility and try to have a one on one conversation about it with her before you write her off completely.", "NTA.  I don't understand why the rule is embarrassing.  Veganism isn't some sort of fringe, uncommon practice that the bf hasn't ever heard of.  Like someone previously said, it's an easy conversation \"hey, my friend is vegan so no meat in her house.  If we want meat we'll have to go out.\"  I'm an avid meat eater but I have never met or dated someone that wouldn't be understanding of this.", "NTA, how hard is it to say \"My friends family is vegan and we can't take any animal products to their house, we can go get a burger for lunch, but we can't eat it there\".", "NTA. \"My friend is vegan so while we're in her house we have to eat vegan for the weekend\" is not embarrassing whatsoever. I don't understand how that would be embarrassing for her. \n\nIf I was the BF I would feel extremely embarrassed to find out I brought meat into a vegan's home against their wishes, because it's rude.

That way they're not cooking at your house in particular but they can still enjoy what they want?\n\n\nI have cousins in my family that do that. They cook steaks outside on the BBQ then just eat indoors. Its a compromise they do since their mother is vegetarian.

A vegan meal is just an omnivore\u2019s meal with animals products removed - of course a non vegan would have no problem with someone bringing that into their home, there\u2019s nothing in it that doesn\u2019t already conform to the omnivore\u2019s diet. \n\nI don\u2019t really see how OP isn\u2019t being empathetic here, she\u2019s giving her friend a free place to stay and cooking her and her bf dinner. She just had one boundary that she made very clear and her friend decided to stomp all over it. She didn\u2019t have to stay there if she didn\u2019t want to follow her friend\u2019s one rule. \n\nI can see that we probably will just have to agree to disagree on this tho - it\u2019s always interesting hearing other people\u2019s perspectives."]}
