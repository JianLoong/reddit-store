Just the two of us, reliving the romance of our early years. We had it all planned out for years now and were excited beyond words.\r  \n\r  \nEnter our adult daughter Jane. Jane and her husband got wind of our plans and promptly invited themselves and their two children (9F, 5M) along. I originally put my foot down and told them this trip was just for us which upset her some. But my wife has a hard time saying no to Jane, as she is the youngest of our children and our only daughter, and she didn't want to hurt her feelings, so she reluctantly agreed to let them join.\r  \n\r  \nI wasn't thrilled about it at the time, but I wanted to make my family happy, and I knew my wife was also okay with the idea of a \"family\" trip even if she was heartbroken we wouldn't get our romantic trip. We went along with it. The place we were originally going was not child friendly so we changed course and decided on an all inclusive family friendly resort. We paid for the resort and our grandchildren's plane tickets. Jane and her husband only had to pay for their own airfare.\r  \n\r  \nHere's where things get complicated. As the vacation got closer, I started having a change of heart. I realized that our 40th anniversary was a once-in-a-lifetime milestone, and I wanted to honor it in a way that was true to our original plans. My wife and I might not be able to afford a trip like this again for quite some time and it's something we always wanted to do.\r  \n\r  \nSo, without consulting anyone, I switched our tickets last minute to go to the romantic destination that my wife and I had originally planned for. I did not tell Jane or her husband. I didn't even tell my wife until the day before our flight left, which was a day before Jane's flight left for their vacation.\r  \n\r  \nIt wasn't an easy decision and I feel guilty about it. But I wanted our 40th anniversary to be the special, intimate celebration we had always hoped for.\r  \n\r  \nWe called Jane after we landed to tell her and she was extremely upset to say the least. She seemed of the idea that we were going to look after our grandkids so she and her husband could have alone time and now that I abandoned her they would have to do it all themselves. I hung up on them when my son in law started shouting and my wife and I enjoyed the rest of our trip.\r  \n\r  \nThey came back the same day we did but have not answered any of our texts and Jane seems to be ignoring me. My wife told me she vastly preferred our trip to the family trip we would have taken but she still doesn't like how Jane is mad at us and wants me to apologize. I'm not sure I want to after learning Jane and her husband were using us for free babysitting and a free trip but I feel like I should just to keep the peace.\r  \n\r  \nAm I the asshole for changing our trip destination last minute and leaving Jane and her family to fend for themselves?", "created_utc": 1697462827, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1795ybo/aita_for_abandoning_my_daughter_on_vacation/", "score": 15212, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Oh, boo-freaking-hoo, they wanted to spend time alone and designated the grandparents to babysit on what should have been their special trip. \n\nIf your daughter and son in law wanted alone time on a trip, they could have gone on a different trip and politely asked you and your wife to watch the kids while they were away. Not try and hijack your trip! \n\nDo not feel guilty OP. Not even for a second. You and your wife have done the parenting of your kids and now it's time to start enjoying life as a couple again. Sure, you're parents and grandparents but you're still a couple and deserve to enjoy falling in love with each other all over again with romantic trips that **DO NOT** include your offspring or grandkids. \n\nYour daughter needs a swift kick of reality right in the tookus.

If I were in your place, I'd leave the reach out to Jane to see when she will try to contact you. Communicate all this with your wife too.

What, is she too poor or too stingy to afford a babysitter for a couple of nights? Most family friendly resorts offer this service for a fee or kids' clubs / disco nights included in the price of the stay, so it's not like you worry about where to find a reliable babysitter or activities for the kids.\n\nYour daughter is unfair to you and unappreciative of what you do for her. When my parents paid for me and my family I thanked them! I did not get upset because they didn't pay for gas, too.", "NTA. Your own daughter wants you two to be babysitters on your anniversary? You have raised an entitled daughter.

They owe you an apology.", "NTA\n\nForget the ESH and YTA verdicts. \n\nYour daughter and husband invited themselves on your anniversary trip in order to get alone time.

I'm glad you changed your plans and had a great vacation.", "NTA but what a rod your wife and you created for your backs. Spoiled girl became spoiled woman. What did your other children think of her and her family getting a free trip? Or are they so used to her getting whatever she wants they gave up?", "NTA\n\nSince your daughter is only speaking to your wife right now then your wife should be the one demanding an apology.

However, please note that we still gifted you a vacation, which is incredibly generous on our part.

The only additional point I would make is that you and your wife should have put your foot down at the beginning, that is how you would have avoided the ESH tag.

Also OP and wife seem like push overs in the name of peacekeeping. Well OP, you were an a-hole in not standing up to you\u2019re own daughter so don\u2019t be an a-hole to yourself again and go apologize right away.

Do you not understand how insane that is?", "Totally agree. ESH. Jane and her husband sound absolutely dreadful but secretly changing plans so you don't have to deal with the fallout is cowardly and weak and most importantly in this scenario,  it wasn't considerate of his wife, either. Or for the grandkids who were probably looking forward to hanging out with their grandparents, and then had this unpleasant surprise. Jane should never have inserted herself into your special trip, \nbut once it had been agreed upon by ALL parties,  that changes things.

He changed it in part because he didn\u2019t think they would be able to afford something like this again for a while- so the answer is to spend a bunch more money without letting your wife know?", "Hard agree. If you wanted a romantic trip you should have said so from the beginning. It was childish to change things at the last minute. You should have just said no, and put your foot down like adults.

OP should\u2019ve stopped this shit dead in its tracks the minute Jane tried to invite herself.", "Yeah. Changing his wife\u2019s plans without telling her was a major AH move.

I\u2019m appalled at all the \u201cnot the asshole\u201d comments here. \nYeah, the daughter is entitled as heck but clearly they\u2019re enabling this behavior. They should\u2019ve said no in the first place. Instead they even switched vacation spots to accommodate then failed to have a simple conversation about changing their mind with their child. Abandoning someone at a planned vacation, without so much as a word, is an absolute asshat move. And all these commenters would be furious if that happened to them.", "This is correct.

Not communicating to anyone (even his wife!) is a huge dick move, and I would go so far to say cowardly. \n\nIf he'd have stayed firm he could've had his big trip and a clean conscience, but you're spot on in that his feeling guilty is the answer. \n\nThis post is just to get validation for making a shitty choice, and he's getting it.", "Totally agree. Daughter sucks for inviting herself and being entitled to her parents anniversary trip, but his communication skills suck. He should have been more honest and put his foot down with the daughter from the get-go and if he begrudgingly went along and then had a change of heart, he should have sat everyone down and lovingly explained his position before rebooking their trip. Even have a conversation with his daughter explaining that the anniversary trip was special and Mom has a hard time saying no to her so please don\u2019t guilt her or ruin this trip for her. Then if she still freaks out about it, that\u2019s her problem.", "Lol all the top comments are saying NTA. How unhinged is the average redditor?

This whole situation is weird AF.", "Favorite take on this.\n\nJane is more the asshole, but completely abandoning the kids and grandkids was kinda shitty. Imagine this wasn't an anniversary but everything else was still the same. Without the justification its shitty, with it its shitty but justified. People tend to think justification nullifies bad behavior.\n\nOP I want to clarify that you made the second best choice.

NTA. Just be an adult about it!", "I agree NTA, but I do think he should apologize for being sneaky about changing the trip.  He should have put his big boy pants on and just flat out told them he was changing things when he did it, not the day before they left.

No, they shouldn\u2019t have offered to let the daughter come at all or make it a family function. But passively going along with it and then backing out at the last second once they\u2019d already left is kind of pathetic and on some level is rude to do to someone. If I asked someone on a trip and they agreed, I prepared for months, and then 10 minutes before the plane leaves, they canceled I\u2019d be pretty fucking annoyed with them. Not because they canceled, but because they didn\u2019t communicate and were so scared of pissing me off they ended up waiting so long that I would DEFINITELY be pissed off by then. If you raise a child to be spoiled to the point you\u2019re accommodating them at 32 and you\u2019re so scared of them you go along with whatever you say because you can\u2019t deal with any pushback, that\u2019s deeply unhealthy as well. Standing up to someone is one thing, but choosing to \u201cstand up\u201d to them last minute in a sneaky way that will fundamentally change their trip last minute is rude, regardless of the circumstances. And feeling your family doesn\u2019t trust you enough to even be honest with you is a legitimate reason to be upset. I\u2019d be pissed too if my parents failed at communication that badly that they had to strand me on my own because they were so afraid to actually talk to me, and then blamed me for something they agreed to for months.
