Her brother probably assumed she'd shared that key information with you.", "NTA it\u2019s 100% on the person with the allergies to inform other, if that person is too young to reliably do so then it\u2019s the responsibility of their parents/legal guardians. \n\nThey need to tell, you don\u2019t need to ask.", "NTA you are not a not a damm mind reader. You don't know this child from Adam. Why  didn't he say that my daughter has a nut allergy or why didn't your own damm girlfriend say anything.  That is thier responsibility to say something.  Not yours.\n\nYou did everything correct", "NTA but Mary's father is.  If you have a child with a severe allergy, it would be normal and essential protocol to inform whoever's care you put them in of this allergy and maybe even provide an EpiPen if needed.  This father was remiss, very remiss, not you.  Fortunately you had to the wisdom to promptly deal with her reaction.", "NTA..This is entirely the parents fault for not mentioning the serious allergy", "So what happens here is this dude assumes that as a woman you\u2019ll be a better parent to his kid than he is, that somehow as a person with no kids and who doesn\u2019t spend every day being told by other parents about allergies and navigating daycare and school communications around it and filling it out for your kids on forms over and over again, it didn\u2019t occur to you to ask. That\u2019s super normal! Having a uterus does not make you magically know everything about taking care of kids.\n\nEvery parent I\u2019ve known with food allergies will tell you before dropping the kids off, because they don\u2019t want their kids to get hurt\n\nSounds like you shouldn\u2019t be doing any babysitting for this dude anymore though", "NTA at all, don't let anyone make you believe otherwise.\n\n1) if there was going to be any presence overlap at all (so many social visits are either at home or at places to eat), Amy should have said something before the visit, it's just part of explaining who is coming. \"My niece Mary is a little girl who is 4 years old and has a severe nut allergy\" is not that hard. I get the impression that OP and Amy share domestic space (even if they aren't living together), so there are many other ways this allergy could have affected Mary that didn't involve food (i.e. ingredients in lotion, not a common thing for people to look at the ingredients of unless looking for something specifically).\n\n2) Seth is a grown man lashing out at you. You are a doctor so you were the safest person for his fuck up to take place around. Not everyone has had enough exposure to food allergies or anaphylaxis to suspect that to be the issue if something goes wrong (for example: mistaking anaphylaxis for choking, trying the Heimlich to fix something it can't, delaying the actual time the life saving medication is administered). If you weren't a physician, this story could have had a very different ending.\n\n3) why would you call Amy if Seth hadn't said anything when dropping her off?\n\n4) a child who is that young cannot be responsible for communicating such a severe issue.\n\nMary should be wearing some sort of Medical Alert accessory any time she is out of her own home (but with Seth showing he could forget to communicate such an important thing, she should be wearing it all the time so he doesn't forget to put it on her). There should also be a kit that goes wherever she goes for such an emergency (medicines such as Benadryl and Epi-pen/equivalent and rescue inhaler if prescribed as well as contact information for Seth and one back up contact). If her allergist suggested this and Seth didn't follow through, that makes him an even bigger AH. If the allergist didn't, the allergist is also an AH and it's time to change providers (and also bring it to someone's attention), especially before Mary starts school.\n\n5) foods are often recalled because of cross contamination or accidental ingredients. My friend with a severe nut allergy doesn't trust food from Aldi's. Why? Their fajita seasoning mix was recalled because of accidental cashew content. Ummm...no fajitas I've ever come across have had cashews in any form anywhere near them (compared to Asian foods and curries, for example), so why would anyone think that is a possibility? Point is, there is no way we have preparation for every scenario possible, because we can't think of every scenario possible. \n\nSo you're certainly NTA. Seth is definitely the AH. And I wouldn't want Amy as my provider if this didn't prompt her to understand she should have said something, knock some sense into her brother, get Mary set up with things to avoid this happening again, and both thank you for saving her niece and apologizing for Seth (and herself) not communicating something so important. Just agreeing that her brother should have told you while basically saying you should have asked (actually she should have also said something if we want Seth to have shared blame), doesn't inspire confidence in me of her as a reliable caretaker.", "NTA it was a last minute babysitting request. he knew you were the only one there and he was running late. and since he was late that was the last thing on his mind to tell you because of course he's running late but that doesn't give him a right to talk to you like that. hes so very lucky you were prepared for something like this because it could have turned into something else very quickly. if it had been me i would've been apologizing profusely while at the same time thanking you to high heavens for being able to take care of a mistake i made. i mean seriously even if you knew about the allergy what happens if she grabbed something before you knew it and had a reaction to it. he should have at the very least left an EpiPen with you in case of emergency. he is irresponsible for not having or leaving anything since she does have allergies. YOU DID NOTHING WRONG NTA", "NTA - his lack of planning causing him to run late does not mean he can push responsibility to you. It's his kid. He knows she is allergic to something its on him to make sure all parties who take care of his child are aware. Even if he's gotta write in on her forehead. . Its easier to lash out. Hopefully when he calms down he can get passed the fact that his actions or lack of action caused his daughter harmed.", "NTA - it's their responsibility to tell you any medical issues, not for you to ask. Even then, they should have known they were leaving you with incomplete information and supplied it. They didn't.", "You're NTA for an honest mistake due to their negligence as a parent.", "If a child has an allergy it is the parent\u2019s responsibility to tell you, not yours to ask.", "NTA , Seth is the a55h0le though.\n\nHe 100% should have told you.\n\nYou, not having kids with allergies yourself, wouldnt think to ask.  Just like you wouldnt go down a list of 100 diseases saying does your child have asthma, leukemia, autism, adhd, etc.  It is the parents responsibility to tell caregivers any special needs their child has.\n\nOne of my kids has allergies and ANY tIME they were away from me and with another adult, even if only 30 min, i made them aware.  Because, as im sure you are aware,.people can and have died from food allergies.\n\nSeth called you \" an ignorant workaholic woman who doesn't care about family\".  \n\nSo what does that make Seth for leaving his precious child with someone he feels that way about?\nThe a55hOle, that is what it makes seth.", "NTA.

Doesn\u2019t sound that far fetched to me.", "You don't have the first aid kit?\n\nAlso, if you give an EpiPen you need to take the person to the hospital. That's basic first aid.\n\nThe half-life of adrenaline is much shorter than an allergic reaction. If a person has an anaphylactic reaction. They need steroids.\n\nPretty plausible that whilst waiting for an ambulance for driving them to hospital yourself. You wouldn't think to call other people.\n\nWhether or not this story is true. This is a very plausible sequence of events.\n\nAlso, do to a first aid course!", "These people work in the medical field it\u2019s really not that far fetched.", "Yeah agree. \n\nI\u2019m an ER doctor with a dope first aid kid and 95 percent of doctors have nothing of the sort. OP says it was a shot and doesn\u2019t specify what but sure folks are assuming epi so let\u2019s go with that. Prob not as much of an issue but the dose of epi for a 4 year old also isn\u2019t the dose for an adult. Also, epi is used in anaphylaxis, no indication of what the allergic reaction was. Someone here mentioned getting steroids at the hospital. Would be impressed if OP could give a definition of anaphylaxis, or meds and dosing at the hospital, or the expected ER course of an allergic reaction. \n\nIf I\u2019m wrong, I apologize, but the number of posts on here by fake doctors gets old.", "The girlfriend wasn\u2019t home, OP was home alone with the child. She probably assumed the parent would inform them of any care instructions, as is normal.", "Also why the duck wasn\u2019t she sent with an epipen?  Even if you knew she was anaphylactic to peanuts, there is always a risk of exposure(which is why epipens go everywhere with the owner).", ">Later when I told Seth about this he was furious. \n\n\"Later\" when you told him.", "I have a first aid kit.  It doesn't include an Epi-Pen because no one in my house has allergies, and an Epi-Pen is an expensive medical device that requires a doctor's prescription (where I live, at least). \n\nEven if I convinced a doctor to prescribe one, the pen expires; so it's not something you can splurge for \"in case a guest has a reaction\" and just leave it forever in the kit like a bandaid.", "If they're from the US, yes, it is. Epi-pens aren't dispensed like candy and they can be eye-wateringly expensive. Of course, perhaps they have their own allergies that necessitate having one in the house.", "Brother and Aunt are both TA's   You don't play games with food allergies.", "I explained the whole process and what happened then, but texted him right away to let him know that Mary had a reaction", "We don't have time to solve the American health care crisis right now.", "FYY Even if the Epi-Pen is expired it will still be effective. Less so than a not expired one but effective enough to save a life.", "I used to regularly babysit my best friend's son, who had several life-threatening allergies. Because of this,  I had an Epi-pen on hand.  Never needed it, thank goodness! If Op is a doctor(sounds like not in the US) not too strange that they'd have one.", "Yeah, no, it isn\u2019t on someone who wasn\u2019t even present at the time to inform the babysitter of a life threatening allergy. That is on the parent, the one literally handing their child over for care.", "Well it is if they actually give a shit about the niece. GF lives with the partner, yeah?", "If she doesn\u2019t care for the niece regularly or if this was not planned well in advance, it is absolutely understandable that it might slip her mind. I have two children. If my BIL was going to babysit, I would not just assume that my sister remembered to tell him something as important as an allergy. If it isn\u2019t something you have to worry about often, it isn\u2019t necessarily something you think to relay. Would it have been nice? Yeah, absolutely. But she isn\u2019t the AH for forgetting to warn them."]}
