If you have a child with a severe allergy, it would be normal and essential protocol to inform whoever's care you put them in of this allergy and maybe even provide an EpiPen if needed.

Fortunately you had to the wisdom to promptly deal with her reaction.", "NTA..This is entirely the parents fault for not mentioning the serious allergy", "So what happens here is this dude assumes that as a woman you\u2019ll be a better parent to his kid than he is, that somehow as a person with no kids and who doesn\u2019t spend every day being told by other parents about allergies and navigating daycare and school communications around it and filling it out for your kids on forms over and over again, it didn\u2019t occur to you to ask. That\u2019s super normal! Having a uterus does not make you magically know everything about taking care of kids.\n\nEvery parent I\u2019ve known with food allergies will tell you before dropping the kids off, because they don\u2019t want their kids to get hurt\n\nSounds like you shouldn\u2019t be doing any babysitting for this dude anymore though", "NTA at all, don't let anyone make you believe otherwise.\n\n1) if there was going to be any presence overlap at all (so many social visits are either at home or at places to eat), Amy should have said something before the visit, it's just part of explaining who is coming. \"My niece Mary is a little girl who is 4 years old and has a severe nut allergy\" is not that hard. I get the impression that OP and Amy share domestic space (even if they aren't living together), so there are many other ways this allergy could have affected Mary that didn't involve food (i.e. ingredients in lotion, not a common thing for people to look at the ingredients of unless looking for something specifically).\n\n2) Seth is a grown man lashing out at you. You are a doctor so you were the safest person for his fuck up to take place around. Not everyone has had enough exposure to food allergies or anaphylaxis to suspect that to be the issue if something goes wrong (for example: mistaking anaphylaxis for choking, trying the Heimlich to fix something it can't, delaying the actual time the life saving medication is administered). If you weren't a physician, this story could have had a very different ending.\n\n3) why would you call Amy if Seth hadn't said anything when dropping her off?\n\n4) a child who is that young cannot be responsible for communicating such a severe issue.\n\nMary should be wearing some sort of Medical Alert accessory any time she is out of her own home (but with Seth showing he could forget to communicate such an important thing, she should be wearing it all the time so he doesn't forget to put it on her). There should also be a kit that goes wherever she goes for such an emergency (medicines such as Benadryl and Epi-pen/equivalent and rescue inhaler if prescribed as well as contact information for Seth and one back up contact). If her allergist suggested this and Seth didn't follow through, that makes him an even bigger AH. If the allergist didn't, the allergist is also an AH and it's time to change providers (and also bring it to someone's attention), especially before Mary starts school.\n\n5) foods are often recalled because of cross contamination or accidental ingredients. My friend with a severe nut allergy doesn't trust food from Aldi's. Why? Their fajita seasoning mix was recalled because of accidental cashew content. Ummm...no fajitas I've ever come across have had cashews in any form anywhere near them (compared to Asian foods and curries, for example), so why would anyone think that is a possibility? Point is, there is no way we have preparation for every scenario possible, because we can't think of every scenario possible. \n\nSo you're certainly NTA. Seth is definitely the AH. And I wouldn't want Amy as my provider if this didn't prompt her to understand she should have said something, knock some sense into her brother, get Mary set up with things to avoid this happening again, and both thank you for saving her niece and apologizing for Seth (and herself) not communicating something so important. Just agreeing that her brother should have told you while basically saying you should have asked (actually she should have also said something if we want Seth to have shared blame), doesn't inspire confidence in me of her as a reliable caretaker.", "NTA it was a last minute babysitting request. he knew you were the only one there and he was running late. and since he was late that was the last thing on his mind to tell you because of course he's running late but that doesn't give him a right to talk to you like that. hes so very lucky you were prepared for something like this because it could have turned into something else very quickly. if it had been me i would've been apologizing profusely while at the same time thanking you to high heavens for being able to take care of a mistake i made. i mean seriously even if you knew about the allergy what happens if she grabbed something before you knew it and had a reaction to it. he should have at the very least left an EpiPen with you in case of emergency. he is irresponsible for not having or leaving anything since she does have allergies. YOU DID NOTHING WRONG NTA", "NTA - his lack of planning causing him to run late does not mean he can push responsibility to you. It's his kid. He knows she is allergic to something its on him to make sure all parties who take care of his child are aware. Even if he's gotta write in on her forehead. . Its easier to lash out. Hopefully when he calms down he can get past the fact that his actions or lack of action caused his daughter harmed.", "NTA - it's their responsibility to tell you any medical issues, not for you to ask.

Prob not as much of an issue but the dose of epi for a 4 year old also isn\u2019t the dose for an adult. Also, epi is used in anaphylaxis, no indication of what the allergic reaction was. Someone here mentioned getting steroids at the hospital.
