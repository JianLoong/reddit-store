My best guesses would be SED; Selective Eating Disorder or ARFID; Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. I have ARFID. It\u2019s gotten easier over time through therapy. I have sensory issues that cause me to feel sick to my stomach at the idea, smell, or sight of certain foods. I have severe anxiety and it manifested the most by upsetting my stomach and making it so I could exclusively eat certain foods. Again, through therapy I\u2019ve gotten better and I have an incredibly expansive palate now, and I\u2019m excited to try new things.\n\nI\u2019d encourage you two to do research on this. The thing is, if she doesn\u2019t do research, do reading or listen to free podcasts on how to get better, and seek out an eating disorder based therapist, you will need to accept that she has certain limitations she is comfortable with not moving out of.

We went to a restaurant and he ordered scrambled eggs with no salt, and he freaked out and sent it back when it had a TINY bit of cheddar cheese on it.

You can order the kit from Amazon and do it at home, it's a simple taste test.\n\nI was a 'picky' eater when I was a kid, but I actually wasn't. When you're a supertaster there are common foods that may taste DISGUSTING and NAUSEATING to you. Being forced to eat them would be like making a normal or non taster eat putrefied, maggot-ridden, sun-ripened roadkill. That is not an exaggeration. \n\nWith regards to the test, you put different paper test strip samples of harmless chemicals in your mouth and note how they taste. For me and our two kids certain samples tasted AWFUL, and my wife tasted nothing. She's a non-taster and we're all supertasters.\n\nThe good news for me is that although it was rough at first my mom finally realized I was not being a picky brat but was instead trying to avoid foods that were literally disgusting. So she was always sure to have at least one dish or side that I could eat.\n\nThe good news for my kids is that I unquestionably respected their food preferences.\n\nThe even better news is that over time we all expanded our palates very widely. The issue was the potential of forced ingestion - you instinctively reject any and all non-standard foods for fear you'll be forced to eat them. But we had a rule, you have to at least try new stuff but you never are forced to eat it.\n\nThis took the pressure off and allowed exploration, and we all have only a few \"hard no\" foods at this point. \n\nThat may not be the case for your girlfriend but it might make sense to invest the $20 for a test kit to be sure. We use the one from \"Bartovation\" from Amazon.", "I get the frustration but is there any chance she's on the spectrum?

Would be a N A H situation, but what makes Op the ahole is the fact that he insulted her food choices. Unless she's eating him, her food choices are not hurting him (except his ego maybe) and if it's on the menu it's not hurting the restaurant as well. Does Op rather want to pay for something she might just take one bite out of and be hungry for the rest of the day? As I said, as a picky eater myself I'm just sick of people commenting on others food choices.

It\u2019s unreasonable to share a life with a partner who is effectively blocking you from getting nutrients from your own kitchen.", "I'm a picky eater. Maybe its the fact I am slightly autistic, however when I go out to eat there are many factors I have to think about. Seeing other peoples food all mushed up on a plate/bones/cracks on a plate or cup just to name a few things, is enough to put me off to the extent that I physically cannot eat or I will throw up, and that will put me off said food for months. (I can't really afford to do that since I have a very limited diet of foods i can eat)\n\nThat being said, If I do feel nauseous to the point I choose not to eat, its just me sat there feeling anxious as hell.\n\nIf on the rare occasion I do try new foods, it takes me a LONG time to eat. Like, 2 hours if its a completely new meal. Most of that just chewing. I guess texture is a big deal to me. If I don't trust/am comfortable with what I'm eating, I am very slow. I just tend not to go when invited to meals, and people ask me why.\n\nIt's a shame people think its a struggle to deal with us, when in reality we all have safe spaces, safe behaviours, safe things. Most people will stay in there comfort zone if they are able too. Whilst I understand variety is the spice of life, some of us just know we arent likely to enjoy something, so we will choose what we know we will enjoy, rather than try something just to please other people and hate the whole experience.\n\nMy partner is also a picky eater. He won't try anything he isn't absolutely sure he is keen on. There have been random candies/things I've wanted him to try, but he didn't want too so I didn't push it. I wouldn't want him to have an unpleasant experience just because I wanted him too, or to guilt trip him into it. At the end of the day, people know if they want to do something, and its not really that much different than trying to push someone with arachnophobia to hold a spider. The only difference is, they would be doing it 3 times a day, because we eat 3 meals (most people do I assume.) When one round of extreme anxiety is enough for most people.\n\nEating isn't supposed to be a chore. For picky eaters, trying new stuff certainly is (at least for me!) If I end up hating it/not liking it, its a vicious cycle, because someone will just want me to try something else, again, and again, and again. It would never stop. If something looks appealing to me I'll try it, but if someone bullies me into it I'm just going to associate it with an unpleasant experience even if it wasn't unbearable.\n\nTLDR: It's difficult for us picky eaters too. Putting ANYTHING in your mouth is an extremely personal thing, and if we don't trust it/don't want too, as human beings, we don't. Even rats will take a small nibble of a food to check its safe/wont make them sick before they give themselves the green light, its just a bit more complex for us. :) There are many different reasons for this. It could be an eating disorder, anxiety, something that happened in childhood, or the general need for something familiar and comforting. Either way, I hope this gives a bit of clarity on what is going on inside our heads whilst others are tutting at us and calling us childish whilst it took effort to attend in the first place to keep people happy.\n\nPerhaps coming to some sort of compromise, perhaps she could try a tiny bit of whatever your eating to see if she likes it? There isn't much point in her ordering a whole ass meal that she might take a nibble of and decide she doesn't like it, thats a waste of a trip, a waste of food and a waste of money.", "Same here. I grew up with Mexican and Italian food, of course. It wasn't that I was against other types of foods, but sometimes breaking out of my comfort zone is overwhelming to me. Also, I'm a vegetarian with no plans to change that. But I started watching food and travel shows and my curiosity was piqued. I don't have travel-around-the-world money but sometimes I have takeout money, so why not put it toward expanding my horizons? I tried new cuisines and I liked them. Now, even if a given cuisine has one vegetarian option, I want to try that one for every cuisine.\n\nIn most cuisines, there's something vaguely recognizable. For instance, I like noodles and cheese, so I often gravitate towards dishes with noodles or cheese, even if the rest is foreign to me, because I know there's at least one component I'll like. That's always an option for expanding your horizons.\n\nAnd may I add that OP's mention that she doesn't like \"non-American\" food is what set me off. First of all, what does that even mean? America is a country of immigrants, so immigrant food kind of is American food. You find the tiniest town in the most backwater region of the US and they'll probably have a Chinese restaurant and an Italian restaurant.

So, why should you take her to a fancy restaurant when she will order chicken fingers? Maybe the atmosphere is more romantic than your sofa at home.

And OP, I really hope you listen.\n\nI\u2019m a picky eater. I\u2019m 27. I suffer from an eating disorder known as ARFID \u2014 Avoidant Restrictive Food Intake Disorder. It\u2019s both an eating disorder (I have extreme sensitivity to texture, consistency, and taste) and an anxiety disorder (I find it very difficult to try new foods, especially in the presence of others) resulting in my palette being very similar to that of your girlfriend.\n\nDo you know what sucks about being afflicted with this? You can\u2019t enjoy food the way that other people do, as much as you want to. You know what else sucks?

Look, I\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you she definitely has ARFID, but god damn dude, do you think she WANTS to be this way? Picky eaters want to experience the joy that other people do when they eat delicious food, but most of the time they can\u2019t really relate. Or they can, but in a much more selective range.\n\nYour girlfriend CLEARLY gets a lot of joy from eating chicken tenders, and not all chicken tenders are created equal.

If you want her to help pay for her share, fine, but god damn dude, this is a part of who she is. My girlfriend likes to go to Michelin Star places, and guess what? I stay home, she goes with her friends. Otherwise, I find what I can eat (or I don\u2019t) and we have nice dates because we value our time together, and she respects me enough that she accepts my shortcomings.\n\nSo, again, YTA, though I may be a bit biased.

It's like taking an exotic vacation and refusing to try the local delicacies because \"why eat this weird goat cheese when there's a Mcdonald's right there? lol\" Sure, the choice to be bland and never try new things will likely always be there, but it sullies the experience for those you're around. I also think it comes down to a compatibility issue, where one person is fine doing the same thing time and time again, while the other wants more excitement and experience in their life. I think this will manifest in other ways as time goes on, if it hasn't already, and cause more resentment because it's a conflicting viewpoint. \n\nTake for instance, I hate seafood. I had many bad experiences growing up with illness from bad seafood and the look/smell/taste doesn't appeal to me very often. I also recognize that there's plenty of types of fish and seafood dishes I've not tried, so if my girlfriend ever suggests I should try something, I can't say I ever turn my nose up to the opportunity or be rude about it. My viewpoint is that whether I like it or not, I'm trying something new with someone I care about and making memories. If my memories were always \"I ate chicken tenders in location A,B,C,D,E,F,G...\" I can't say I'd care to remember many of those moments fondly or vivdly, like nothing would stand out because its virtually all the same.

They make me gag and often spit it out, which is itself incredibly embarasing and ruins the meal for me. So I'm very picky about what new foods I eat unless I can do so in a more \"controlled\" setting. And if I visit a place, I tend to always gravitate to things I've had before or things I can know from the ingredients that I won't have a problem with (and I don't hesitate to ask \"what's in X\" if they don't list it, and refuse to take vague answers). OP's GF could easily be the same way and falls back on the few things she is certain she will like at a given place. Maybe if OP wasn't putting so much pressure on her, she might be willing to try more in a careful, controlled way, but as is usually the case for us \"picky eaters\", the unrelenting judgement of others regarding what we choose to eat makes it nearly impossible to have that \"controlled\" setting I described above.\n\nAlso, for being a huge food snob, OP seems massively ignorant about \"chicken fingers\". I don't know if he's just never bothered to try them, but there is a vast distance between the frozen boxed coagulated garbage that's called \"chicken tenders\" and actually properly prepared *chicken tenders*, at least when they're on the \"real\" menu and not the boxed ones served on the kids menu - though given his \"high class\" tastes I doubt that. There's a lot of variety in this food just as there are in steaks or potatoes or anything you can name.

I have a foodphobia thats like having OCD but only about food. Some days I cant face going into my own kitchen. Some days i cant let myself breathe in certain parts of the supermarket incase the air is contaminated. So how do I deal with it? I do my best to find my own ways of coping. Me and my husband do bits of exposure therapy. Sure I resort to the comfort that is pizza a lot but people don\u2019t call it childish because im an adult that treats it as a real adult problem. Which makes me think in this situation that its more to do with her personality then it is a food problem. Or a mixture of both. But if she insists on dealing with it like a child and making childish arguments I think its more than fair for him to get fed up and complain. I have huge problems with unprepared food so fruit is a massive problem. When I moved in with my husband we went over how we would make it work so he didnt have to give up eating it but id be comfortable and able to eat around him and in our kitchen. We made compromises. We tried things out. Also he provides the food shop, he earns a lot more than me, but if im having a bad week and cant eat what hes provided I will do my best to provide for myself so he isnt overspending.

Sure, it isn't going to be called \"chicken fingers\", but they might just have a boneless breaded chicken dish. And she likes pasta with red sauce, you can go as fancy as you want with that. I compared it to taking a vegetarian to a steakhouse. Even if the salad turns out good, you would be better served going somewhere with a specialty salad they take pride in.", "THANK YOU.

I tried for 2 years with a picky eater but in the end we could never have lived together because I wasn't going to give up pad Thai or lasagne (no red sauce or cheese, vegetables unless boiled pretty much ate kids food or roast dinner) honestly I could have forgiven cheating easier than the utter misery of his diet.", "Picky eaters can be exhausting. I know. I was one and had to go to get professional help as a kid in a special home for kids with eating disorders including aneroxia.\n\nEventually I solved the problem on my own (there's only so long you can deal with people rolling their eyes and laughing at you before you get really motivated). I forced myself to eat stuff by making it a project for the evening. Once spent about an hour eating a quarter of a sausage for my dinner. Or an hour with 5 single kernels of corn.\n\nEventually after you get a few extra goods under your belt it comes crashing down and you can just eat new stuff without any anxiety.\n\nI still remember going to my friend's birthday party and they were serving pizza and salad. The friends mum gave me that look I had becomebvery used to getting before saying she supposed I'd just be having bread and butter again. And I was so excited to nonchalantly say \"nah I'll just have the pizza.\" And watch the impressed relieved long on her face. \n\nI'm still funny about bones and meat (fat, gristle, bloody steaks, couldn't do it) and became a vegetarian. I think if you haven't grown up with tearing into a dead cooked animals flesh it's a hard concept to truly adopt.\n\nAnyway my point is, dealing with anxiety about eating food is really difficult and it's never without reason. Could be trauma. But I think it's most often genetic. There are 3 people in my family just like me who had to work through it.\n\nI hate the idea of writing someone off like this because they haven't sorted out their woes around food. People can be irrational in some areas and intelligent and adventurous in others. Some of the smartest people I know. Way smarter than me. Still insist on walking into a building every Sunday and shouting and singing at the wall with a bunch of other people in fear that if they don't someone will send them to eternal damnation. People have anxieties about shit and existence is horrorful.\n\nI remember when I was even fussier than OPs girlfriend I would love going to restaurants even if I was always having the same thing. It just felt good to go somewhere with the family. Get dressed up. See everyone enjoying their food. Be a part of the atmosphere. Going to a restaurant is about way more than the food. If it wasn't then it would all be take out.\n\nI agree they're not compatible. But not due to a failure on her part. She's going to need patience and understanding around the food issue if she's going to develop and it doesn't seem he's got that. If I was OP I would have said yes but they had to be willing to take a single bit of a new food.\n\nGrowing up I had friends and friends parents who could be absolute assholes around the issue despite being good people otherwise. They seemed to think the most helpful course of action was to berate me into eating food by tutting at me and telling me to stop being so silly and just eat it. Even had one friends mum force a spoon of everything in the dish into my mouth hoping I'd see the light. It just traumatised me more around food and being at tables with people I didn't trust. \n\nSome were brilliant. I had one friend who I'd love going to. They always ordered all sorts of food and would offer me a reward if I tried a new food but there was no pressure. I started eating curry and Bolognese and spaghetti because of them.", "Think about everything picky eating affects.  Can't travel abroad, because GF only eats highly processed \"American\" food.

I can't even genuinely believe that he's going to restaurants where that is what they're being served because even the fast food place I work at hand-dredges the chicken strips. I can believe that mcdonalds maybe doesn't, but I have trouble believing that there's very many places even a half-step up from fast food that don't use actual raw chicken that they fry themselves for chicken strips. And I feel bad for his girlfriend frankly, if the only tenders they get at home are out of a bag because while trying to make fries without a fryer can be ridiculously hard, cutting up a breast and pan frying it is already going to be miles above the frozen stuff in quality, and still be well below the lowest restaurant tier due to not having a proper freaking fryer to fry it in. \n\nAlso the embarrassment is ridiculous. No one is watching what this couple orders. The servers don't give a shit, the other patrons aren't sitting there watching what everyone around them orders, and no one is going to assume that a girl ordering chicken tenders ONLY eats chicken tenders, because that's a crazy thing to think about some stranger in a restaurant. Thinking that anyone else gives a shit what you're ordering is silly. Acting like you're better than others while assuming restaurant chicken tenders are the same as frozen ones from the grocery store is silly. Thinking that a perfectly fried, juicy, chicken strip with fries is lesser in any way to anything you order is silly, and a little sad. \n\nThis is OP's insecurity about other's perception of him and his own hang ups around what is and isn't appropriate for adults to eat.

She might not be choosing to be picky. She probably isn't enjoying it either.\n\nMy husband is a big foodie and loves different and exotic things. He loves me for me. He orders whatever he wants and I order whatever I want and we each try a bite of each other's meal. We have a good time, and we take turns paying.\n\nJust try to see things from her perspective, too.", "Was swinging between E S H and N A H.\nI hate when food aversions are written off as being \"childish\". They can be a stubbornness against trying new things, it can be intense anxiety over it. Or sensitive sense of taste, or texture. My brother will eat anything, but he has very poor sense of taste and smell. I'm the opposite.\nAnd she tries to find something at each restaurant, which to be fair is more than I do, though I'm happy to sit with a drink as everyone else eats. It's just nice to go out with company sometimes.\n\nBut I get his side of paying loads of money for something simple. Like a compromise would be to go out still, but not to somewhere really expensive. Or if she wants to pay since she's the one that wants to go there specifically.", "I think this is the best response. The problem isn\u2019t that she\u2019s a picky eater; really who cares what she eats IF she pays for herself. I\u2019d still like to go to fancy places for the experience and not just the food.", "I am also on the side of ESH. It\u2019s good that she seems willing to make any restaurant work despite being picky. But I agree with OP that her asking to be taken to pricey restaurants where OP is expected to pay, only to get food that could be gotten at a less expensive restaurant, is pretty ridiculous. Why does she even want to go to this new restaurant so badly? When I want to try a new restaurant, I am intrigued by their menu/food. That\u2019s not even an interest of hers. Not wanting to take her to expensive places because you\u2019re paying more for food that she could get elsewhere is not unreasonable.\n\nHowever, it is unreasonable for OP to be \u201cembarrassed\u201d by this at a restaurant. She\u2019s not the only picky eater going there. And people aren\u2019t paying that much attention to you, dude. No one\u2019s like, \u201cWow, do you see that woman eating white rice? How embarrassing.\u201d I can understand OP being embarrassed by it at a family gathering or something, where she\u2019s refusing to eat anything made by OP\u2019s family. But a restaurant is different.\n\nAnd OP did not have to be such a jerk about it. Instead of calling her food \u201clittle kid food,\u201d OP could have said, \u201cIt\u2019s expensive, and I just don\u2019t know why you would want to go to an expensive restaurant to get the same thing you could get at a less expensive restaurant.\u201d It could have been an actual conversation. But instead, OP belittled her preferences right out of the gate.", "I agree with this. I also want to add that when it comes to extreme picky eaters autism or something similar may be the reason and they can't help it.\n\nI'm a quite normal person but ever since I was little I've been extremely picky with clothes. I can't abide itchy, uncomfortable clothes. I've worn these clothes anyways to fit in and it never got better anyway, I'm always feeling uncomfortable especially when I move, so much so that I go all stiff and don't want to move. I can't help it. So I try to think of these picky eaters like that too. Some can't help it.", "I agree. Spending time together in a nice restaurant to create memories is just as important as the food (if not more). \n\nAlso, I am going against the grain here. I was labelled a picky eater for many years. I also had to stick to the same food that seemed to \u201csit well\u201d; potatoes, chicken fillets and schnitzels, rice dishes, plain fried fish, etc. I HATED garlic, onion, spring onion, soft cheeses, etc. If I tried to eat this food, I\u2019d feel physically ill and was labelled dramatic. \n\nMy ex partner told me that it was a waste of money to take me out, even though it was nice to try different delicious schnitzels or rice dishes. There is a huge difference between frozen chicken tenders and beautiful chicken tenders at a lovely restaurant that does beautiful Jewish chicken schnitzel with a side of matza ball soup. \n\nAfter being called childish and repeatedly being forced to go outside my comfort zone, I found out I actually had                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  fructose malabsorption and lactose intolerance; I chose the same dishes as I could tolerate and digest them properly.

There's an artisan ice cream shop nearby that costs $6 for one scoop in a small cup (cones are extra.)", "Yea they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about lol. I started to post a comment before I saw yours explaining how they were wrong because my wife used to work at a very high end restaurant and one of their almost never ordered items was \u201clightly breaded chicken tempura\u201d or something like that and it was just Tyson chicken tenders they dumped in an oven because almost nobody ever gets the tenders at that nice of a restaurant.", "Well, op is complaining about paying $15 for chicken fingers. That seems like a fairly low price to pay for a meal out to me, especially since usually it would be more than just chicken fingers on the plate.", "I mean of course lol, I'm glad you're able to validate my comment. \n\nWhy would a high end restaurant hand make an effectively off menu item lmao", "Chicken fingers are ok but only with custard.", "Yes, I'm allergic to crustaceans too and I say \"sono allergica ai crostacei\", we don't have \"easier\" words for most things, just the scientific ones \ud83d\ude01  Same for most languages, my advice is to use the direct translation for \"crustacean\" and people will usually understand better than \"fish with a shell\"!\n\nI always thought shellfish was molluscs, like mussels and clams, because they actually have a shell. I'll keep saying crustaceans in Anglo countries like I've always done because shellfish just sounds so ambiguous to me! Whenever waiters are confused I just say \"shrimp, lobster, crab etc\".", "Do you like spending time with her?\n\nGoing to places (including restaurants) with someone you like is about being with this person, the conversations, and the overall experience (getting ready, being in a nice setting).  What's on her plate is secondary. \nLooks like you care more about what other think more than you just enjoying time with you girlfriend. \nNext time instead of focusing on her food, just focus on her.\n\nYTA.\n\n\nAnd if you really just want someone who like all foods, get a pig. And stop judging your adult girlfriend eating habits.", "What the fuck does it matter? She\u2019s not forcing you to eat it. And if you get embarrassed by what your dining partner has on their plate then that\u2019s on you. So many people here in the comments need to do some \u2018growing up\u2019 themselves and learn to enjoy their partner\u2019s company rather than being bothered what other people might think of them.", "I can\u2019t believe I had to scroll down so far to find this! I\u2019m autistic and stay pretty rigid on my safe foods. My partner is pretty understanding of this and we take turns picking where to eat when we do go out, which makes everyone happy.", "So surprised I had to scroll this far down to see this.", "My problem is that part of the \u201cshared experience\u201d of dining out is the excitement of the food itself. If she wants to try someplace new and different because the atmosphere is interesting but doesn\u2019t want to partake of the food then be clear about it (and pay). I also think OP needs to be able to go without her to places to enjoy the experience without the drama of her being excluded.", "Oh my god thank you I was starting to think I was crazy going through this thread.", "We don't hate them, they just need to be dating each other.", ">After reading the comments on the thread, I'm surprised how much people hate picky eaters. But a lot of picky eaters can't do anything about it.\n\nIt's not that we hate them as human beings but it's insufferable. Like, if you loved swimming but your companion didn't like getting anywhere near water, you'd be frustrated if they would say \"Let's go to the beach\" and when you got there, they stayed in the car because they don't like being near water and they did it every time.", "Exactly that\u2019s what gets me too like if it\u2019s on the menu it\u2019s there for a reason, it\u2019s such an insane idea to me that you\u2019d judge someone for that.", "Even if it's not an eating disorder it's just shit to act like they are. It's not enjoyable to have such issues. You get constant comments about what you eat and people look down at you for it, you have higher risk for illness and so on. It's so ridiculous. How hard is it to leave others plates be? They're aware of their diet. You're not helping.", "Why do people act like all burgers/tenders are created equal?\n\nYes I could get a $2 mcdouble, but I pay $15 for good burgers more often.", "If you aren\u2019t into the bar/nightclub scene where you have to yell to be heard, where would you go to get dressed up and have a nice night with you mate", "I was forced to eat baked beans as a kid the one day my brother wasn't there at daycare to stick up for me, and I hate them to this day. I don't mind the flavor actually but I just can't bring myself to eat them.", "Well yeah, what about the non fancy places? That should be good enough?", "I can\u2019t imagine getting a blowout, doing your makeup, wearing something nicer than the norm, maybe some heels and a pretty purse\u2026 just to go eat chicken tendies at TGI Fridays.\n\nShe says she\u2019s \u201cdying\u201d to go try this upscale Nepalese restaurant. What is she \u201cdying\u201d for? She doesn\u2019t eat any of the food they offer\u2026 so what exactly is it that is enticing her to go? To go take pics for Instagram? Why can\u2019t she eat chicken and rice? Almost every type of cuisine has their own rendition of chicken and rice, and even the pickiest eaters should be able to eat that.", "I'm kind of also interested to know what restaurant it is here huh?", "Yep, that's what I'm thinking why would she want to go there?", ">This isnt r/femaledatingstrategies and he should have some say about where his money is spent\n\nUnless they're married, he should have the **only** say in that.", "Would make more sense if the tips were shared with the kitchen.", "Yeah, the \"I always pay\" thing is their own business but did make me pause. There's many fair reasons that could be the case (she's a SAHM, she's a student, she pays for other stuff), but if there's resentment there I'd resolve that before getting pissy about what my partner orders.", "Well she does like to eat fancy, I'll give her that for sure.", "The difference is at the restaurant you probably get 3 chicken tenders and at Walmart you get a lb bag. Price per lb at my local walmart for Tyson frozen chicken strips is $5.76.  I highly doubt the meal is serving a pound of chicken strips, so it is far greater than three times the price.", "Fair point then!", "\"I\u2019ve been to nice places that have had an entire alternative menu (that they just don\u2019t advertise).\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEither that, or you just tell the waiter what you want for your kids, and they prepare it.", "I cannot stand picky eaters. I would not be compatible with a picky eater because I love eating adventures. And experiencing people's food is what I like to do. If you won't even try it, I get irrationally angry. Just fucking try a teeny bite. \n\nLuckily, even my 4 yo will try something as long as her safe foods are present. She will try a pomegranate seed if a banana is on her plate and taking up way more room. And that's all I can ask. But if you won't even try???? I'm so glad I married someone who tries everything. He has never liked onions but he says \"well let me try it and see if I changed my mind yet. Hmm...not yet.\" \n\nNTA and I agree maybe not compatible.", "Agreed. I can't believe all the N-T-A he's getting. He sounds ridiculous and condescending. Let her eat what she enjoys. I go to the restaurant for chicken tenders - guess what, they taste way better than any I could make at home and I enjoy it.", "As a former Certified Executive Chef, usually we had something like that on our kids menu - but was always the cheapest garbage, frozen chicken tenders money could buy because they weren't a standard Menu item and making hand-breaded tenders for something that we received maybe 5 orders for per month was a waste of time and energy", "Not just that, the tenders meal is probably the cheapest thing on the menu! So OP is complaining about his gf being a cheap date.", "I know someone who took his ex to Paris to propose to her.  After having one French meal she would only eat at McD\u2019s for the rest of the trip!!  That right there should have been his giant red flag not to go on with the relationship in my eyes, but alas, we often have strange blinders on in love (or sunken costs.)", "I'm trying to imagine and upscale \"Authentic Nepalese\" restaurant that has fries and chicken nuggets on the menu. Hmmm... I can't imagine it.", "She could be interested in the dressing up and ambiance of nice restraunts, which can still be fun. But the food she's not as interested in. That's my guess. There is more to fine dining than just the food", "There's a difference between a steak and chicken tenders."]}
