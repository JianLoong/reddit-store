You are calling her a child and you are acting like you're better than her. Why else would you point out how adventurous you are and how childish she is?

I promise you no one at the restaurant will care. You need to apologize.", "I\u2019m going to give a gentle YTA here. \n\nI get that it would be frustrating to pay a ridiculous price for chicken tenders. \n\nHowever, being embarrassed is not necessary. If anyone were to be embarrassed, it should be her. But I don\u2019t think she should be embarrassed.

Your logic is sound, your delivery seems a little cold though and could easily have come across as condescending.", "NTA I wouldn't want to waste that much money on chicken tenders. It's pointless. The solution here is she can pay if that's what she wants. Or eat tenders at home and go for a drink.

Of course it was always something so different from my safety foods, but little by little I grew to find it exciting to try something new.

Heck she's technically SAVING you money, because she's probably ordering the cheapest meal on the freaking menu! If you were willing to go and spend $50 on her meal then why are you whining about spending $15?? Grow up man, she's not forcing you to change the way you eat, so why are you trying to force her?  \n You also whine about \"why would I pay for something we can make at home?\" News flash, you can make any dish at home, for cheaper, by just buying the ingredients for it and finding a recipe, so that excuse for judging her doesn't hold water.

It sounds like you do think you're better than her. You clearly state in your post that you're embarrassed when she places her orders. Has it ever occurred to you that some people might enjoy the atmosphere of a nice restaurant? Or the drinks? Or enjoy conversation with their partner while their partner is enjoying a meal?

Maybe lasagna bolognese? Maybe she can explore karaage or chicken katsu at a Japanese restaurant.", "NTA \n\nIt would have been hurtful to hear but if she only wants to eat the exact same dish there isn\u2019t much of a point in going to a new restaurant. \n\nAlso, since she isn\u2019t a child is there a reason why she doesn\u2019t pay for food when you go on dates?", "Curious\u2026 if you went to a place that had chicken tenders and burgers, but only on the children\u2019s menu, would she do the maze before or after she challenged you to tic tac toe?", "Soft YTA.

Not a single person in my life has let me get away with that without some sort of condemnation, so while I feel for you, I mainly feel for her. \n\nYou're right, you can make those things. But things taste different at different places. My parents were like you, if it's a burger bun, there's no difference between the dollar brand at Walmart and an artisan roll. Chicken tenders from the frozen aisle are trash compared to a nice restaurant, so please, stop comparing like that for your own sanity. \n\nShe may be embarrassed or defensive about it too. For people like us, every single dinner date or anywhere in an uncontrolled environment is scary because of food and judgement.

There is an internal stressor around food.  I have a daughter like this and while thanks to good therapists when she was a child, social skills groups and real effort on her part, you would never know she is spectrum on meeting her, the food thing has never been able to be resolved.

Although my husband and I both eat various things, he usually prefers steak. We can make steak at home for less but we get dressed up and go to a steakhouse, if we want. I don't see why what she gets is a problem and if you keep going out she may find a different dish she likes. \n\nThe people around you don't know if she has allergies or is on a restrictive diet, I get it costs a little more than Walmart freezer section but sometimes it's about having a date not getting food you can't cook.

I\u2019m aware of that. In a nicer restaurant, I only order things I don\u2019t know how to make or that are prohibitively complex/messy to do at home, so the recipe, cooking skill, and/or unusual ingredients are what I choose to pay for.", "I mean, some nice restaurants have really elevated \u201ckids menu\u201d stuff.  \n\nBy that logic it\u2019s not worth going to any fancy restaurant for any reason since you can make or get similar elsewhere.\n\nA fancy restaurant near me has the best French fries I\u2019ve ever had.

You don't go to a high end restaurant.", "This, she sounds like she has arfid. \n\nI still love fine dining, and I have arfid.

She is purposely refusing to engage in ANY of the experiences that HE pays for.", "Yes! Thank you! As someone who stayed picky into their early 20\u2019s, I have now expanded my diet to include much more types of foods. If my parents took us to an Asian restaurant when I was a kid, I would have white rice with salt. Today, that grosses me out. But I noticed that I am really sensitive to flavors and textures. It took me many years to start eating a wide variety of foods, and there are still some I won\u2019t eat.\n\nIf the gf wants to go to a fancy restaurant, why can\u2019t OP be happy to go out on a date?

He doesn't want to spend all that money for his GF to get chicken finger, which I totally understand, and he's not the one asking to go to these places. His GF, who orders chicken fingers, is.

She may have had a bad experience with the other stuff, for me it's banana's and cream cheese. It's the texture, don't like it, not gonna eat it.

It's not like she's trying to limit his food life, she's willing to go just about anywhere with him, it sounds like. What does he do for desert? Quip about how she doesn't appreciate jazz?
