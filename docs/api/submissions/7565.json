I have thrown bags of dog poop into my own bin, and sometimes they break due to being pressed against something else in the bin. When that happens, you get dog poo smeared inside your bin that will stink and has to be washed.\n\nSuggestion: There are some awesome and cheap dog poop bag holders you can buy on amazon and just clip it to your leash or treat pouch. That way, it's easy to carry it during your walk till you can toss at a public trash bin at the park or at home in your own bin.", "YTA.\n\nYour dog. Your poop. Your problem. Don't wanna carry a poop bag? Don't have a dog or make sure it shits in YOUR yard before you go for a walk. \n\nRegardless, your dog, your problem.", "I personally hate people putting their rubbish in my bin, especially dog poop.", "soft YTA. I have a dog too so I get it. I don't want to carry around his poop longer than I need to. It's fine to throw their poop in public dumpsters and trash cans. It's rude to throw it away in someone's personal bin. You and I signed up for dealing with dog poop but our neighbors didn't. They shouldn't have to deal with it on their property.", "Sorry, YTA.\n\nI understand your reasoning why it should be ok, but I HATE it.  And I have 2 dogs of my own. This scenario often causes more work for me. Maybe you think it doesn't or shouldn't, but it does. Those dog bags do not keep poop nearly as secure as you think. Then I have to clean out the garbage can, because that shit smells for quite some time until it dries like concrete on the inside of the can.\n\nWHY do this work? Garbage cans are stinky!  No, mine are not.  I only put stinky stuff in after it goes to the curb. My icky smelly food garbage hangs out in the freezer until garbage day.  The dog poop stays in a bucket outside by the back door until garbage day. WHY? My cans are have to live in my garage, and stinky garbage cans = stinky minivan. No thanks.\n\nAlso, sometimes the little poop bags cling to the bin & don't make it into the garbage truck (mechanical arm one) an fling it to the ground in front of my driveway & splat open.  That's fun.\n\nHow often does this happen, to be mad about it?  At least once a month.  Either cleaning the bin or picking up poop in the driveway.

People would put things in my garbage when it was out for collection that weren\u2019t allowed (like loose poop bags or loose fast food garbage) and I\u2019d get fined and have to dig around to \u201cfix\u201d the garbage for the following week. \n\nI had similar issues when I had a big dumpster during renovations. People would dump their stuff (like mattresses) and I had to pay extra for that. \n\nI walk my dogs and I just carry the poop home to put in our garbage. It\u2019s not that hard.", "YTA.

I have a dog, those poop bags end up at the bottom of the can, even when there are bags of trash in them already. They then cling to the bottom, so they do not get taken out with the garbage. They sit there and stink at an unholy level. Then the homeowner has to deal with it. You have to put those bags in the larger bags of household trash. So, I say AH, don't make your dog's poop anyone else's problem.", "YTA!!!!! \n\nI can't stand people who do this.

It\u2019s not that hard. \n\nIt really fucking sucks when people toss poo bags in a trash can, the actual owner doesn\u2019t see it, and then throws their own trash on top. It explodes the bag. Not cool. \n\nSincerely, a professional dog walker of 8 years.", "YTA. A private trash can is exactly that. Private. They paid for it so they have a right to say who can use it.

YTA", "Soft YTA. Some communities have what's called \"Theft of Services\" which is basically about taking liberties with someone else's trash service. So technically, you are trespassing by handling their trash can (property) without permission, and stealing by using their trash service without permission. These are not public trash cans, they are privately owned. While you get brownie points for picking up after your pet, you really should be throwing it away in your own trash can, not taking advantage of someone else's property without their permission.", "YTA. You never know what the requirements are for pick up- in my neighborhood, if it\u2019s not inside a standard 13-33 gallon trash bag, it may be left behind. I personally have had issues with people not picking up after their dog, and I won\u2019t do it until trash day because:\nA.

They don\u2019t make can liners large enough to fit my toter that goes at the end of the driveway. Which means that teeny tiny poop bag will be left behind unless I dive in there and dig it out to throw in a larger bag. No thanks!", "YTA.\n\nI have a dog, I get it. I have a small waste bin on my front porch for his poo. His poo is my responsibility and my responsibility only.\n\nIn my neighborhood, the trash collectors will only gather trash that is in a trash bag. If you toss a small bag of poo in the bin, it will fall to the bottom of the bin and stay there. If that happens repeatedly, it can get pretty gross.

A guy in my neighborhood hates it so much, he pulls the bags from his bin and throws them in the street, where they immediately get crushed by cars. (His house fronts a big street and backs up to a former alley, and his bins are stored right off that back street where they are accessible to walkers.) It\u2019s a really big deal where I live, in a hot climate, and it\u2019s considered really rude to use someone else\u2019s bin.", "I (reluctantly) say YTA. There are lots of people who do not want dog poop (even bagged up) in their trash. I guess the polite thing to do as a dog owner is to bag the poo and take it home to throw away in YOUR trash can, but honestly, I would rather have the poo in a trash can instead of smushed on the side of the road - esp if the owner doesn't loop back around and pick it up. I know some people are wild about this topic.", "YTA.  If you can't be a responsible pet owner, don't be one.  Dog poop is your responsibility, full stop.  Clean up your dog's poop and take it with you.  Even if it wasn't poop, you are the Ahole for using someone else's private property without permission.  Shame on you.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s your dog, your responsibility, you hang onto the poop until you get to a public bin.\n\nLittle dog poop bags get squished and broken by larger bags in the bin.

Just put the trash in your own bin, or in a public bin. It avoids this conversation entirely.", "YTA. No one likes carrying bags of dog poop, but we carry it to our own bins anyways.", "YTA - It\u2019s never okay to put things in other peoples trash bins. It always freaks me out some people find this acceptable.", "YTA.  My bin is emptied early in the day. One day I came home and took it in around 5. I discovered someone put a bag of dog poo in my empty bin. It smelled terrible and I had to live with it for a week in the hot summer. There is a park bin three houses down but no they had to put it in my bin. Thank goodness the bag it was n didn\u2019t break or I would have had to wash dog poo out of my bin. \n\nSo no, don\u2019t put your dog poo in someone else\u2019s bin. Carry it home.", "YTA People like you are the worst", "Yes, YTA, as it's not your garbage can. It doesn't seem like a big deal since you're only adding to what's already there and it all stinks, but it's still not right. Most of the time it won't affect anything but I can understand why people don't want others' garbage dumped there. If the bag broke then that person could potentially have poop smeared in their trash can, and then guess who has to clean that up?\n\nThis may not be the case where they live but it's worth mentioning.  Depending on the municipality you live in, some sanitation workers can and will refuse pick-up if things aren't to  a certain standard - such as if there's loose garbage outside of the bigger bags.  I know someone whose town didn't offer garbage pickup services so they had to go with a private company who would simply bypass houses if they tried to throw anything that was not on the approved list and were quite strict about it.", "YTA. We have two dogs and even we don't put all of the dog poop into the main garbage bin until the day of garbage day. Even bagged, dog poop smells way worse than anything else that we put into the garbage bin. People don't want their bins smelling like dog poop, especially if someone doesn't even have a dog.", "As a dog owner I fucking hate people who do this. I've had an empty garbage on my front desk get put dog poop bags in it before. I then put normal bags on top of it cause I don't see it.  You think the garbage man gets every last drop out of the garbage when he's emptying it? No. Suddenly I see an old stanky ass shit down there. So much rage. YTA despite it being a full garbage etc", "YTA.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your garbage can and not a public garbage can. What entitles you to use someone else\u2019s bin?", "Soft YTA. You\u2019re picking it up and throwing it away, which is infinitely better than leaving it, but it\u2019s common dog walking etiquette to not throw it in someone else\u2019s trash unless they give you permission. Put it in a public trash can or the trash can where you were staying. I walk all three of my dogs at once and am sometimes carrying three bags of poo past many private, residential cans to either get to a public one or my own.", "NTA. Once a bin is on the street, it's public property. That's why cops can gather evidence from it. Owners have no say over what happens with it. You don't want dog poo in it, bring it back in once it's been emptied.  \n\n\nOtherwise, it's for trash, and dog poo is trash. I do this all the time. People complain when dog owners DON'T pick up after their dog. What do you want us to do, huh?? We've picked up after a dog, now a public (granted, temporary) trash can is in my walking path. Imma use it. N.T.A. All day, NTA.", "YTA if\u2026\n \nYou don\u2019t know when the garbage is being collected. If it is O-dark thirty on garbage day thrn it should be fine *as long as* you put it in the correct can and don\u2019t cause the owner\u2019s garbage to be rejected.  That totally happens here. I\u2019ve lived in various parts of CA and I think Los Angeles was least picky.\n \nYou don\u2019t know which of the 3 cans to put it in (as above).\n\nIt is generally in poor taste.  Get to know the neighbors ij that area because it is generally a good idea.  A perk is asking if you can use their cans and what days are best.  Also, good way for doggo to score treatos!", "YTA. That isn't your property to fill with dog poop. Personally, I bought a bag meant for holding treats and clipped it to my dog's leash. I just store the full bags in there until I get home. It is rude to leave your dog waste on someone else's property.", "YTA and not even soft. Carry your dog\u2019s shit with you, lazy entitled slob.", "YTA without a doubt! Why wouldn't your neighbor want your shitbags in his garbage?", "Sorry, but YTA\n\nI would never throw my dog\u2019s poop (or any garbage for that matter) in someone\u2019s private garbage can. \n\nYou\u2019re walking through a beach community - there\u2019s bound to be a public garbage can on your route.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain here and say NTA.  I totally put my dog poop in other peoples trash cans.  I don\u2019t like walk up to their house but if the trash can is out, I put my poop bag in.  Trash man comes twice a week so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s sitting out forever.    I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s a big deal.

Sorry all you people whose trash cans I use!!", "I think it depends on how the trash company collects the trash. I'm my neighborhood. They only take bagged trash, so they would not pick up the individual bag of dog poop. I have on many occasions had to did put multiple bags of other peoples dog poop from the bottom of my trash can, and I assure you it is not fun, and I get annoyed every single time I have to do that.  If that's the case in that neighborhood, or if you don't know of that's the case y-t-a, if you owe for a fact that they do the entire can into the truck, I'd go with n-t-a. \n\nPS, I'm a dog owner too.", "YTA, people who don't have animals don't want their bins smelling like shit.", "YTA\n\nNobody wants your dogshit in their bins. Why they don't want it doesn't even matter.  Use your own bins for your own dogshit.", "YTA it\u2019s not your can so it\u2019s not for you to use.

Just continue carrying your little bag o' poo to your house and put it in your own can.  \n\n\nThose little bags settle to the bottom of the can and often aren't emptied when the trash collectors come.   Then the can sits in the sun  -- the stench is pretty bad.

If it had already been emptied, that\u2019s another story.", "NTA\nThe old dude was screaming at clouds. Gatekeeping trash cans says you have serious control issues.

It\u2019s all going to the dump somehow.", "NTA - what does he things goes in a garbage  ??", "NTA but tossing garbage into someone else's can be illegal, even if the can is on the street.  By and large this is meant to prevent your neighbor from throwing away their garbage, for collection, into your can to just avoid fees (sometimes paid to the municipality or to a private company) or piggy back off your service without your approval (many services have weight limits and may charge you more so your neighbors garbage might even cost you extra).\n\nThe nosy neighbor here, while he is probably correct from a technical standpoint is more of the AH here just on premise.\n\nTechnically, even tossing in a piece of paper you picked up off the street and tossed away would fall under violating such laws but it most likely would be ignored by law enforcement and the courts.  Your dog poo bag would most likely be laughed at by any officer called to attend to such matter and, even if charged, the court would probably dismiss the case over such a menial one-time occurrence.\n\nThe weird thing is that the opposite is usually not true.  Once garbage hits the street it becomes \"public\".  This means that people can remove items from your can.  This is how police sometimes get evidence and private investigators do some investigating... all without warrant.  In some places it might even be legal for me to drive up in a truck and dump your garbage into the back and drive off.  Some states have restricted this \"public\" standing however.  Some jurisdictions actually say that garbage on the street in an opaque container and a closed lid is still \"private\" and may not be inspected by others.", "NTA  ... it's a trash can... out for pick up.... that's where trash goes; not to mention, if the can is on the street then it's no longer private property.", "NTA. If the trash can was full of trash and put out by the road,  it makes no sense that she couldn't put it into the trash as long as it was bagged\n\nEdit: well, that was my opinion until I read the other comments.  I'd move to \"NAH but probably don't do it in the future because some people apparently hate it.\"", "NTA.\n\nThe garbage can isn't his property. You are obliged to dispose your dog's poop, so why would he even complain about this in the first place?", "NTA. I guess i\u2019m in the minority here.. but there\u2019s really nothing wrong with doing that. If anyones going to get upset about something smelly in their trash they either are just generally grumpy, or have so little going on in their lives they need something to care about.", "NTA. It's a bin not his kitchen table.", "ESH. it wasn't that guys can so he should have kept his mouth shut.\n\nAnd this is one of those things that while it may be technically legal that doesn't mean its in good taste or courteous.", "It was a public trash can so NTA.  However, if it was my personal can, the answer is don't.  Because in our community the trash people have really strange rules.  They only take trash that is bagged, even if it's in a trash bin. They won't upend the trash can ever.

He ran over and yelled at my wife: \"You're disgusting. You can't do that. Why would you put your dog's waste (his term) in someone else's can.\" She said: \"it is a garbage can. People put nasty things in garbage cans. That's what they're for.\" He harassed her until she took it out. \n\nIs my wife (am I) the asshole here for putting a tied bag of poop in a stranger's street side garbage can?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
