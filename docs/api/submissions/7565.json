When that happens, you get dog poo smeared inside your bin that will stink and has to be washed.\n\nSuggestion: There are some awesome and cheap dog poop bag holders you can buy on amazon and just clip it to your leash or treat pouch. That way, it's easy to carry it during your walk till you can toss at a public trash bin at the park or at home in your own bin.", "YTA.\n\nYour dog. Your poop. Your problem.

My most upvoted comment is about dog poop.", "Sorry, YTA.\n\nI understand your reasoning why it should be ok, but I HATE it.  And I have 2 dogs of my own. This scenario often causes more work for me. Maybe you think it doesn't or shouldn't, but it does. Those dog bags do not keep poop nearly as secure as you think. Then I have to clean out the garbage can, because that shit smells for quite some time until it dries like concrete on the inside of the can.\n\nWHY do this work? Garbage cans are stinky!  No, mine are not.  I only put stinky stuff in after it goes to the curb. My icky smelly food garbage hangs out in the freezer until garbage day.  The dog poop stays in a bucket outside by the back door until garbage day. WHY? My cans are have to live in my garage, and stinky garbage cans = stinky minivan. No thanks.\n\nAlso, sometimes the little poop bags cling to the bin & don't make it into the garbage truck (mechanical arm one) an fling it to the ground in front of my driveway & splat open.  That's fun.\n\nHow often does this happen, to be mad about it?  At least once a month.  Either cleaning the bin or picking up poop in the driveway.

I have a dog, those poop bags end up at the bottom of the can, even when there are bags of trash in them already. They then cling to the bottom, so they do not get taken out with the garbage.

So technically, you are trespassing by handling their trash can (property) without permission, and stealing by using their trash service without permission.

While you get brownie points for picking up after your pet, you really should be throwing it away in your own trash can, not taking advantage of someone else's property without their permission.", "YTA. You never know what the requirements are for pick up- in my neighborhood, if it\u2019s not inside a standard 13-33 gallon trash bag, it may be left behind.

I have a small waste bin on my front porch for his poo. His poo is my responsibility and my responsibility only.\n\nIn my neighborhood, the trash collectors will only gather trash that is in a trash bag. If you toss a small bag of poo in the bin, it will fall to the bottom of the bin and stay there. If that happens repeatedly, it can get pretty gross.

A guy in my neighborhood hates it so much, he pulls the bags from his bin and throws them in the street, where they immediately get crushed by cars. (His house fronts a big street and backs up to a former alley, and his bins are stored right off that back street where they are accessible to walkers.)

There are lots of people who do not want dog poop (even bagged up) in their trash. I guess the polite thing to do as a dog owner is to bag the poo and take it home to throw away in YOUR trash can, but honestly, I would rather have the poo in a trash can instead of smushed on the side of the road - esp if the owner doesn't loop back around and pick it up. I know some people are wild about this topic.", "YTA.  If you can't be a responsible pet owner, don't be one.  Dog poop is your responsibility, full stop.

No one likes carrying bags of dog poop, but we carry it to our own bins anyways.", "YTA - It\u2019s never okay to put things in other peoples trash bins. It always freaks me out some people find this acceptable.", "YTA.  My bin is emptied early in the day. One day I came home and took it in around 5. I discovered someone put a bag of dog poo in my empty bin. It smelled terrible and I had to live with it for a week in the hot summer. There is a park bin three houses down but no they had to put it in my bin. Thank goodness the bag it was n didn\u2019t break or I would have had to wash dog poo out of my bin. \n\nSo no, don\u2019t put your dog poo in someone else\u2019s bin. Carry it home.", "YTA People like you are the worst", "Yes, YTA, as it's not your garbage can. It doesn't seem like a big deal since you're only adding to what's already there and it all stinks, but it's still not right. Most of the time it won't affect anything but I can understand why people don't want others' garbage dumped there. If the bag broke then that person could potentially have poop smeared in their trash can, and then guess who has to clean that up?\n\nThis may not be the case where they live but it's worth mentioning.  Depending on the municipality you live in, some sanitation workers can and will refuse pick-up if things aren't to  a certain standard - such as if there's loose garbage outside of the bigger bags.  I know someone whose town didn't offer garbage pickup services so they had to go with a private company who would simply bypass houses if they tried to throw anything that was not on the approved list and were quite strict about it.", "YTA. We have two dogs and even we don't put all of the dog poop into the main garbage bin until the day of garbage day. Even bagged, dog poop smells way worse than anything else that we put into the garbage bin. People don't want their bins smelling like dog poop, especially if someone doesn't even have a dog.", "As a dog owner I fucking hate people who do this. I've had an empty garbage on my front desk get put dog poop bags in it before. I then put normal bags on top of it cause I don't see it.

I walk all three of my dogs at once and am sometimes carrying three bags of poo past many private, residential cans to either get to a public one or my own.", "NTA. Once a bin is on the street, it's public property. That's why cops can gather evidence from it. Owners have no say over what happens with it. You don't want dog poo in it, bring it back in once it's been emptied.  \n\n\nOtherwise, it's for trash, and dog poo is trash. I do this all the time. People complain when dog owners DON'T pick up after their dog. What do you want us to do, huh?? We've picked up after a dog, now a public (granted, temporary) trash can is in my walking path.

I\u2019ve lived in various parts of CA and I think Los Angeles was least picky.\n \nYou don\u2019t know which of the 3 cans to put it in (as above).\n\nIt is generally in poor taste.

Just continue carrying your little bag o' poo to your house and put it in your own can.  \n\n\nThose little bags settle to the bottom of the can and often aren't emptied when the trash collectors come.   Then the can sits in the sun  -- the stench is pretty bad.

By and large this is meant to prevent your neighbor from throwing away their garbage, for collection, into your can to just avoid fees (sometimes paid to the municipality or to a private company) or piggy back off your service without your approval (many services have weight limits and may charge you more so your neighbors garbage might even cost you extra).\n\nThe nosy neighbor here, while he is probably correct from a technical standpoint is more of the AH here just on premise.\n\nTechnically, even tossing in a piece of paper you picked up off the street and tossed away would fall under violating such laws but it most likely would be ignored by law enforcement and the courts.  Your dog poo bag would most likely be laughed at by any officer called to attend to such matter and, even if charged, the court would probably dismiss the case over such a menial one-time occurrence.\n\nThe weird thing is that the opposite is usually not true.  Once garbage hits the street it becomes \"public\".  This means that people can remove items from your can.  This is how police sometimes get evidence and private investigators do some investigating... all without warrant.  In some places it might even be legal for me to drive up in a truck and dump your garbage into the back and drive off.  Some states have restricted this \"public\" standing however.  Some jurisdictions actually say that garbage on the street in an opaque container and a closed lid is still \"private\" and may not be inspected by others.", "NTA  ... it's a trash can... out for pick up.... that's where trash goes; not to mention, if the can is on the street then it's no longer private property.", "NTA.

It's an AH move, and if you are using the police and law to justify it, then you are an AH and a dumbass, because that argument should logically make you anti-poop, not pro-poop.", "Exactly this happened to me last month, and it was both gross and annoying.", "Wrong. SCOTUS held that you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy in a bin located on the curbside because it's readily accessible to the public. SCOTUS absolutely did not rule that something you own placed in a location readily accessible to the public is now part of the \"public domain.\" Applying your reasoning would make Jeeps parked with their tops off part of the public domain.\n\nSource: lawyer", "The contents of the trashcan aren't safe from search and seizure because you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy in items you're planning to throw away (btw this ruling is total bs, but fine, it's the law, whatever). The trashcan itself is not suddenly communal property, and when my neighbor threw a poop bag into my can and I had to scrub it out, it sure felt like I was the owner and responsible party for that bin at the time.", "People need to lighten up, doggie owner here and if my trash can is at the curb then toss away.", "Probably YTA, but honestly, you can use my bin if you want to, it's a fucking garbage bin, if you can't share at least this with the community, like c'mon, it's not that big of a deal and you're doing more good by sharing than having the other person carry shit back home. But since you don't have the consentment of the other person to use their bin, YTA.", "NTA. If it\u2019s on the curb and ready for pick up it\u2019s fair game\nETA: when they are on the curb they become public property which is why police can search them without a warrant. \nIt is 100% fair game in the eyes of the law. So you can put your bagged dog poo in it", "NTA. this is some entitled suburban nonsense on the neighbor\u2019s part. It wasn\u2019t even his can that he was griping about. Plus, from the way the can was already overflowing, it would soon be picked up. It wouldn\u2019t have the chance to leave a lasting smell. \n\nAs a fellow dog owner, I think depositing dog poop in a freshly emptied can would render a slightly YTA verdict.\n\nTrash is trash.", "NTA a trash can is a trash can and a dog poop bag isn\u2019t that big. People who get mad at this are annoying", "NTA - please pick up your trash and use my trash can if it\u2019s on the street ready for pickup. If it were emptied that day you\u2019d be the asshole, or if you went onto their property you\u2019d be the asshole. But those are not the case.", "OP can\u2019t put trash in a trash can? This makes absolutely no sense.", "Bingo. In many areas, it is ILLEGAL to throw your trash in a private bin. Part of what you pay for (be it taxes for municipal service or a monthly trash service) is the empty space in your bin. Anyone (in said areas) is guilty of theft when they \u201csteal\u201d space in your bin. It doesn\u2019t matter if the bin is on the street or not. It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s empty or full. They\u2019re not going to legislate a mathematical formula for when it\u2019s okay to use someone else\u2019s bin. They\u2019re going to say you can or you can\u2019t. And lots of places say you can\u2019t, no matter how many Redditors \u201cthink\u201d otherwise.", "HOAs love getting their noses into everything. Literally.", "At least in my city, you can technically be fined if you mess up and put recycling in the regular garbage. These days I use opaque bags to avoid it. (Because NYC doesn\u2019t actually recycle its plastics making the whole thing ridiculous and I\u2019m not playing along.) So don\u2019t put anything in my trash because those fines aren\u2019t cheap.", "Idk I have a neighbor that will do this and it\u2019s incredibly gross and annoying in the summer, especially when there\u2019s nothing else in the can the bag tends to stick to the bottom", "I live in a complex that will not take anything out of the cans that isn\u2019t in an actual garbage bag. When people throw free trash in the can, it gets left there. I find it rude for people to do this.", " I have a dog that lives with my parents. If she shits on a walk I hold her poop bag till I find a public trash or I carry it home with me. A month or so ago, I was putting my recycling bin up after pickup and some asshole had thrown dog feces in it. There was a park with a public trashcan literally a couple yards from my house. We\u2019ve gotten maggots from people doing this before, and it\u2019s not fun to clean up. Absolutely the asshole.", "Nope. Dog poop is a very particular kind of garbage that can fuck up a can royally. \n\nI had a can in the alley behind my house. It would regularly get left in the street by the trash guys and as a result the lid was broken, didn't keep water out. Wasn't a big deal under most occasions. \n\nBut of course people would regularly drop dog poop into my cans in the middle of the week. Rain water would fill the thing up with poopy water. And id get to clean that out because the trash guys sure as hell weren't gonna touch it.", "Depends on how the trash is picked up. If the bins are upended into the truck, it's fine. If the garbage people take the bags from the can, the poop bags will end up falling to the bottom of the bin and festering for weeks. Happened to my mom constantly.", "Lord have mercy you do this for every walk you go on? You might be singlehandedly keeping Ziploc in business. \n\n>All it takes is even a minute of forethought to be considerate.\n\nI mean this in the kindest way, but who hurt you? This is so many steps beyond being considerate and to play it off like this is normal and the bare minimum, just wow.", "Seriously, I was wondering if everyone else in this thread used bags made of rice paper", "I had chicken go rancid the evening after trash was picked up, in the Deep South during the summer. Even with mitigation (triple bagging, putting baking soda in the bag, etc.) it still reeked and I spent a week trying not to gag every time I put trash in the bin. I'd be livid if someone else put their animal waste in my empty bin.", "My city has a certain amount that is included in your yearly property taxes - anything that fits in a 60L bin, collection every other week. Anything else you have to buy tags for the extra bags.\n\nBut also: that garbage can will be sitting in the extreme heat for 2 weeks after the garbage trucks pass. Please don't put shit in an empty can!", "What? I literally bought my trash bins. They cost $100 each on [Lowes.com](https://Lowes.com). \n\nDon't turn off the comments because you're wrong and started your entire post with an incendiary \"per the law\" (which I def read in a British accent).", "Yeah no the \u201ccommunity\u201d can\u2019t randomly seize, search, and abscond with your bins.", "This is where I'm at with it. Especially because I have to keep my can indoors due to wildlife. Last thing I want is my garage smelling like dog shit and I can't leave my can out because then I have bears and mountain lions getting into it.", "I still get annoyed at this, because my local council will often refuse to collect if the stuff in the bin is not bagged. Loose rubbish causes the whole bin to not be collected, and that is a major annoyance (not to mention having to remove the loose rubbish and bag it myself).", "yup.... this! it stinks up the can and it has the risk of breaking, making a mess for the can owner. \n\njust take it back home with you, for goodness sake! how hard is that?! \ud83d\ude21", "Apparently very hard for entitled people who are too lazy to carry back their pet\u2019s poo but somehow think you\u2019re the one with issue for not wanting to deal with it"]}
