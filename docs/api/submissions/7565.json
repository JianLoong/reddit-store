I have thrown bags of dog poop into my own bin, and sometimes they break due to being pressed against something else in the bin. When that happens, you get dog poo smeared inside your bin that will stink and has to be washed.\n\nSuggestion: There are some awesome and cheap dog poop bag holders you can buy on amazon and just clip it to your leash or treat pouch. That way, it's easy to carry it during your walk till you can toss at a public trash bin at the park or at home in your own bin.", "YTA.\n\nYour dog. Your poop. Your problem. Don't wanna carry a poop bag? Don't have a dog or make sure it shits in YOUR yard before you go for a walk. \n\nRegardless, your dog, your problem.", "I personally hate people putting their rubbish in my bin, especially dog poop.", "soft YTA. I have a dog too so I get it. I don't want to carry around his poop longer than I need to. It's fine to throw their poop in public dumpsters and trash cans. It's rude to throw it away in someone's personal bin. You and I signed up for dealing with dog poop but our neighbors didn't. They shouldn't have to deal with it on their property.", "Sorry, YTA.\n\nI understand your reasoning why it should be ok, but I HATE it.  And I have 2 dogs of my own. This scenario often causes more work for me. Maybe you think it doesn't or shouldn't, but it does. Those dog bags do not keep poop nearly as secure as you think. Then I have to clean out the garbage can, because that shit smells for quite some time until it dries like concrete on the inside of the can.\n\nWHY do this work? Garbage cans are stinky!  No, mine are not.  I only put stinky stuff in after it goes to the curb. My icky smelly food garbage hangs out in the freezer until garbage day.  The dog poop stays in a bucket outside by the back door until garbage day. WHY? My cans are have to live in my garage, and stinky garbage cans = stinky minivan. No thanks.\n\nAlso, sometimes the little poop bags cling to the bin & don't make it into the garbage truck (mechanical arm one) an fling it to the ground in front of my driveway & splat open.  That's fun.\n\nHow often does this happen, to be mad about it?  At least once a month.  Either cleaning the bin or picking up poop in the driveway.

People would put things in my garbage when it was out for collection that weren\u2019t allowed (like loose poop bags or loose fast food garbage) and I\u2019d get fined and have to dig around to \u201cfix\u201d the garbage for the following week. \n\nI had similar issues when I had a big dumpster during renovations. People would dump their stuff (like mattresses) and I had to pay extra for that. \n\nI walk my dogs and I just carry the poop home to put in our garbage. It\u2019s not that hard.", "YTA.

I have a dog, those poop bags end up at the bottom of the can, even when there are bags of trash in them already. They then cling to the bottom, so they do not get taken out with the garbage. They sit there and stink at an unholy level. Then the homeowner has to deal with it. You have to put those bags in the larger bags of household trash. So, I say AH, don't make your dog's poop anyone else's problem.", "YTA!!!!! \n\nI can't stand people who do this.

It\u2019s not that hard. \n\nIt really fucking sucks when people toss poo bags in a trash can, the actual owner doesn\u2019t see it, and then throws their own trash on top. It explodes the bag. Not cool. \n\nSincerely, a professional dog walker of 8 years.", "YTA. A private trash can is exactly that. Private. They paid for it so they have a right to say who can use it.

YTA", "Soft YTA. Some communities have what's called \"Theft of Services\" which is basically about taking liberties with someone else's trash service. So technically, you are trespassing by handling their trash can (property) without permission, and stealing by using their trash service without permission. These are not public trash cans, they are privately owned. While you get brownie points for picking up after your pet, you really should be throwing it away in your own trash can, not taking advantage of someone else's property without their permission.", "YTA. You never know what the requirements are for pick up- in my neighborhood, if it\u2019s not inside a standard 13-33 gallon trash bag, it may be left behind. I personally have had issues with people not picking up after their dog, and I won\u2019t do it until trash day because:\nA.

I have a small waste bin on my front porch for his poo. His poo is my responsibility and my responsibility only.\n\nIn my neighborhood, the trash collectors will only gather trash that is in a trash bag. If you toss a small bag of poo in the bin, it will fall to the bottom of the bin and stay there. If that happens repeatedly, it can get pretty gross.

A guy in my neighborhood hates it so much, he pulls the bags from his bin and throws them in the street, where they immediately get crushed by cars. (His house fronts a big street and backs up to a former alley, and his bins are stored right off that back street where they are accessible to walkers.) It\u2019s a really big deal where I live, in a hot climate, and it\u2019s considered really rude to use someone else\u2019s bin.", "I (reluctantly) say YTA. There are lots of people who do not want dog poop (even bagged up) in their trash. I guess the polite thing to do as a dog owner is to bag the poo and take it home to throw away in YOUR trash can, but honestly, I would rather have the poo in a trash can instead of smushed on the side of the road - esp if the owner doesn't loop back around and pick it up. I know some people are wild about this topic.", "YTA.  If you can't be a responsible pet owner, don't be one.  Dog poop is your responsibility, full stop.

Just put the trash in your own bin, or in a public bin. It avoids this conversation entirely.", "YTA. No one likes carrying bags of dog poop, but we carry it to our own bins anyways.", "YTA - It\u2019s never okay to put things in other peoples trash bins. It always freaks me out some people find this acceptable.", "YTA.  My bin is emptied early in the day. One day I came home and took it in around 5. I discovered someone put a bag of dog poo in my empty bin. It smelled terrible and I had to live with it for a week in the hot summer. There is a park bin three houses down but no they had to put it in my bin. Thank goodness the bag it was n didn\u2019t break or I would have had to wash dog poo out of my bin. \n\nSo no, don\u2019t put your dog poo in someone else\u2019s bin. Carry it home.", "YTA People like you are the worst", "Yes, YTA, as it's not your garbage can. It doesn't seem like a big deal since you're only adding to what's already there and it all stinks, but it's still not right. Most of the time it won't affect anything but I can understand why people don't want others' garbage dumped there. If the bag broke then that person could potentially have poop smeared in their trash can, and then guess who has to clean that up?\n\nThis may not be the case where they live but it's worth mentioning.  Depending on the municipality you live in, some sanitation workers can and will refuse pick-up if things aren't to  a certain standard - such as if there's loose garbage outside of the bigger bags.  I know someone whose town didn't offer garbage pickup services so they had to go with a private company who would simply bypass houses if they tried to throw anything that was not on the approved list and were quite strict about it.", "YTA. We have two dogs and even we don't put all of the dog poop into the main garbage bin until the day of garbage day. Even bagged, dog poop smells way worse than anything else that we put into the garbage bin. People don't want their bins smelling like dog poop, especially if someone doesn't even have a dog.", "As a dog owner I fucking hate people who do this. I've had an empty garbage on my front desk get put dog poop bags in it before. I then put normal bags on top of it cause I don't see it.

YTA despite it being a full garbage etc", "YTA.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your garbage can and not a public garbage can. What entitles you to use someone else\u2019s bin?", "Soft YTA. You\u2019re picking it up and throwing it away, which is infinitely better than leaving it, but it\u2019s common dog walking etiquette to not throw it in someone else\u2019s trash unless they give you permission. Put it in a public trash can or the trash can where you were staying. I walk all three of my dogs at once and am sometimes carrying three bags of poo past many private, residential cans to either get to a public one or my own.", "NTA. Once a bin is on the street, it's public property. That's why cops can gather evidence from it. Owners have no say over what happens with it. You don't want dog poo in it, bring it back in once it's been emptied.  \n\n\nOtherwise, it's for trash, and dog poo is trash. I do this all the time. People complain when dog owners DON'T pick up after their dog. What do you want us to do, huh?? We've picked up after a dog, now a public (granted, temporary) trash can is in my walking path. Imma use it. N.T.A. All day, NTA.", "YTA if\u2026\n \nYou don\u2019t know when the garbage is being collected. If it is O-dark thirty on garbage day then it should be fine *as long as* you put it in the correct can and don\u2019t cause the owner\u2019s garbage to be rejected.  That totally happens here. I\u2019ve lived in various parts of CA and I think Los Angeles was least picky.\n \nYou don\u2019t know which of the 3 cans to put it in (as above).\n\nIt is generally in poor taste.  Get to know the neighbors ij that area because it is generally a good idea.  A perk is asking if you can use their cans and what days are best.  Also, good way for doggo to score treatos!", "YTA. That isn't your property to fill with dog poop. Personally, I bought a bag meant for holding treats and clipped it to my dog's leash. I just store the full bags in there until I get home. It is rude to leave your dog waste on someone else's property.", "YTA and not even soft. Carry your dog\u2019s shit with you, lazy entitled slob.", "YTA without a doubt! Why wouldn't your neighbor want your shitbags in his garbage?", "Sorry, but YTA\n\nI would never throw my dog\u2019s poop (or any garbage for that matter) in someone\u2019s private garbage can. \n\nYou\u2019re walking through a beach community - there\u2019s bound to be a public garbage can on your route.", "I\u2019m going to go against the grain here and say NTA.

Trash man comes twice a week so it\u2019s not like it\u2019s sitting out forever.    I don\u2019t really think it\u2019s a big deal.

Sorry all you people whose trash cans I use!!", "I think it depends on how the trash company collects the trash. I'm my neighborhood. They only take bagged trash, so they would not pick up the individual bag of dog poop. I have on many occasions had to did put multiple bags of other peoples dog poop from the bottom of my trash can, and I assure you it is not fun, and I get annoyed every single time I have to do that.  If that's the case in that neighborhood, or if you don't know of that's the case y-t-a, if you owe for a fact that they do the entire can into the truck, I'd go with n-t-a. \n\nPS, I'm a dog owner too.", "YTA, people who don't have animals don't want their bins smelling like shit.", "YTA\n\nNobody wants your dogshit in their bins. Why they don't want it doesn't even matter.  Use your own bins for your own dogshit.", "YTA it\u2019s not your can so it\u2019s not for you to use.

Just continue carrying your little bag o' poo to your house and put it in your own can.  \n\n\nThose little bags settle to the bottom of the can and often aren't emptied when the trash collectors come.

It\u2019s all going to the dump somehow.", "NTA - what does he things goes in a garbage  ??", "NTA but tossing garbage into someone else's can be illegal, even if the can is on the street.  By and large this is meant to prevent your neighbor from throwing away their garbage, for collection, into your can to just avoid fees (sometimes paid to the municipality or to a private company) or piggy back off your service without your approval (many services have weight limits and may charge you more so your neighbors garbage might even cost you extra).\n\nThe nosy neighbor here, while he is probably correct from a technical standpoint is more of the AH here just on premise.\n\nTechnically, even tossing in a piece of paper you picked up off the street and tossed away would fall under violating such laws but it most likely would be ignored by law enforcement and the courts.  Your dog poo bag would most likely be laughed at by any officer called to attend to such matter and, even if charged, the court would probably dismiss the case over such a menial one-time occurrence.\n\nThe weird thing is that the opposite is usually not true.  Once garbage hits the street it becomes \"public\".  This means that people can remove items from your can.  This is how police sometimes get evidence and private investigators do some investigating... all without warrant.  In some places it might even be legal for me to drive up in a truck and dump your garbage into the back and drive off.  Some states have restricted this \"public\" standing however.  Some jurisdictions actually say that garbage on the street in an opaque container and a closed lid is still \"private\" and may not be inspected by others.", "NTA  ... it's a trash can... out for pick up.... that's where trash goes; not to mention, if the can is on the street then it's no longer private property.", "NTA. If the trash can was full of trash and put out by the road,  it makes no sense that she couldn't put it into the trash as long as it was bagged\n\nEdit: well, that was my opinion until I read the other comments.

I guess i\u2019m in the minority here.. but there\u2019s really nothing wrong with doing that.

It's a bin not his kitchen table.", "ESH. it wasn't that guys can so he should have kept his mouth shut.\n\nAnd this is one of those things that while it may be technically legal that doesn't mean its in good taste or courteous.", "It was a public trash can so NTA.  However, if it was my personal can, the answer is don't.  Because in our community the trash people have really strange rules.  They only take trash that is bagged, even if it's in a trash bin.

The lid was half up, as it was quite full and ready for pickup.\n\nMy wife deposited the tied closed bag-O-poo into the can. \n\nA man mowing his lawn at the house next door (it was not his trash can) went off. He ran over and yelled at my wife: \"You're disgusting. You can't do that. Why would you put your dog's waste (his term) in someone else's can.\" She said: \"it is a garbage can. People put nasty things in garbage cans. That's what they're for.\" He harassed her until she took it out. \n\nIs my wife (am I) the asshole here for putting a tied bag of poop in a stranger's street side garbage can?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Like if this is the big thing in your life that\u2019s a problem- then I think you probably have it pretty good.", "This right here.  It's perfectly legal to \"dumpster dive\" once it has been one it is presented for collection.  Pro Tip: if you're going through a divorce or some other legal issue, assume your trash is being collected by a private investigator and analyzed for potential evidence to use against you.", "I doubt the bag tearing open and smearing poop around the bin happens as much as these commenters on reddit says it does, lol. Right now I live in a dog friendly apartment complex that just has several large dumpsters for all trash and I've never seen these mountains of spattered dog poops either on the dumpsters, by the dumpsters, or in the streets, that some of y'all are claiming happens in your residential neighborhoods. I've never even seen this once, in my entire life.  \n\nI know someone will reply with \"it totally happened to me\" but I'll let you know ahead of time I don't believe you lol.", "My garbage collectors aren\u2019t lazy but they mostly dump out the cans and if a small bag is stuck to the bottoms they\u2019re not going to reach in and dig it out.  I don\u2019t blame them.  That\u2019s why I don\u2019t put tiny individual dog waste bags in my can, I collect them in a separate can and transfer them to a full size garbage bag.", "That's my issue. If my can is at the end of the driveway, it's trash day. If trash hasn't ran, by all means, I don't care if you put it in there. But I live in the south. If my trash has ran, and the can is empty, do NOT put anything in there. Especially poop. It stinks, it'll get maggots and just No!", "NTA -  there\u2019s a distinct difference.   If you\u2019re walking by and the bin is at the end of the driveway or wherever it\u2019s free game, if it\u2019s up by the house and you have to walk up to the persons house or side of their house then YTA.\n\nPeople if you don\u2019t want stuff in your bin, bring the bin up to your house or in your garage or away from the street/sidewalk.", "My bin is given free by the county. Picked up for free by the county. When I put it on the curb my trash (as does ALL trash at the curb in USA) becomes public property. Since the bin belongs to the county as well... literally none of it is mine once at the end of the driveway", "What kind of terrible rubbish service do you have that you can only have a single bag of trash per week and one small poop bag won't get picked up?", "I honestly wouldn\u2019t mind if you put a water bottle in my garbage can. Dog poop is another thing altogether, it stinks.  I wouldn\u2019t put my dog\u2019s waste bag in someone else\u2019s can, I don\u2019t want a stranger\u2019s dog poop in mine.", "I get this... My rule is that if it's full and. On the curb, I have no qualms dropping the bag in. If it's empty and it's a day or two after pickup, it's a no go for this very reason, but if your can is still on the curb 4 days after pickup I'll toss in am empty bin. \nIf I'm not far from the house I'll carry it home.\n\nOnce it's on the curb,you can root through it if you want...", "How do you have to deal with it? Can you not just leave it where it is until trash gets picked up? What am I missing?\n\nEdit: after reading other comments I get it now", "Courtesy isn't defined by your personal standards; it's broadly defined by the views of society as a whole.\n\nIt's clear from the comments here that many, many people don't like bags of poop in their trash cans. So you're being a discourteous dog owner when you put bags of dog poop in other people's trash cans.", "Trash pickup is different in different areas. Our trash gets picked up on Thursday afternoons. You're the reason why people think dog owners are inconsiderate.", "It doesn't matter if you don't think it happens often, the fact is it does sometimes,  and you're the kind of person who is ok making other people clean your literal shit.  You're an asshole.", "Yeah lol a dog shit bag isn't going to spontaneously tear while at rest inside a bin filled with other garbage bags. Especially if it's on top.", "I find it interesting so many people are ok with theft of another\u2019s paid service", "Sadly, that doesn't work in my city. Even with my bins pulled up into my driveway and close to the house AND motion sensor lights, people still walk up onto the property to toss their dog bags. \n\nWhat's worse, they never toss it in the trash - always my yard waste or recycle bin - which are completely different colors and have stickers from the trash company that say \"NO DOG WASTE\". Dog poop in the wrong bin can result in a fine assessed to ME since the bill is in my name. \n\nI've reached the point where I wish the issued bins had a way to padlock them.", "In many neighborhoods you have to place the trash bins on the street for pickup then bring them back. The bins are not fair game as they are not community trash receptacles .", "That's not a reasonable guideline.  On trash day, people's bins are typically out on the street for the trash collectors to pick up, even if the bins are typically by their house or in a shed/garage.  They're there because if they aren't they won't be picked up, not for others to use.", "It\u2019s garbage day.  You don\u2019t get to uses someone\u2019s bin without permission.", "This is the logic I use every day for my dogs turdz.", "Hey, since we're just making up arbitrary rules as we see fit, how about this one: \"it's your dog, you deal with its shit\"?", "Not if it's empty or partially empty. Then the poo bag falls to the bottom where it gets smooshed and leaks", "Not sure about this poster, but I have lived places where you pay for garbage pickup by the bag. You can opt for one bag a week, pay more for two bags a week, and sometimes pay more for unlimited pick up or to have the guys come down your driveway to get your trash so you don\u2019t have to drag the trash cans to the street.", "Because the city wants to go \"green\". We are soon moving to one bag every two weeks. :( \n\nGreen in quotes because so much that is recyclable and compostable... the city wont accept as such so I have no choice but to toss it in with garbage anyway.", "In my community it could cause them not to pick up your trash at all. They don\u2019t want you disposing animal waste in the trash, and while I\u2019m sure people hide it in there, if it\u2019s right on top and they see it they can decide to not empty your can at all and you\u2019re stuck with it another week", "I agree. If it's on the curb it's gonna get picked up on bin/trash day anyway, so if you want to put something in there while you're going past, I don't mind.\n\nBut don't just put a poobag in there just because you can or because it's more convenient.", "Give in, keep your bins outside to please the trash panda gods!", "No, dog owners are inconsiderate because I find dog poop in my yard.", "Nah dude I've only ever done it in one neighborhood the garbage gets picked up on Monday mornings at 9 am (recycling pick up comes around 1) when the garbage cans on the the curb waiting to get picked up, Ive said this multiple times, not sure why that's so hard to comprehend.", "No one is claiming they rip spontaneously, they can rip when the contents of the bin shift around while being emptied.  If you have to exagerate an extreme to make your point, your point is bad.", "Lol. Ok man", "Yeah that is wrong.   I mean you could pad lock them.  Drill a hole through the edge and strap a combo lock on it.", "Yeah.  Place it on the street and move it back up to your home when it\u2019s been emptied or you get home if you\u2019re so worried about others rubbish in your bin.   The bin clearly hadn\u2019t been picked up so if it was full then it was slated to be emptied.   Empty bin on trash day, I could sympathize with.", "I feel if it's at the curb and hasn't been picked up yet it's fair game. If you do this after it's already picked up and is going to sit in someone's bin for as long as possible and stink it up then it's an AH move", "You pay for the household rubbish collecting service.", "Yep 100% theft", "I lived in place that got had to buy tags for your bags to be picked up. Each individual bags, no matter how small needed a tag. There might have been a by-the-bin option, but we were too broke (college) to afford it.", "There's much easier ways for a city to go green. Back in Australia before I went to the US they have 3 bins usually. General waste, recycling, and green waste. To go \"green\" they basically just pick up the general waste fortnightly and recycling weekly (green waste alternates weeks with general waste). Pretty simple and encourages recycling.", "Where do they want you to dispose animal waste?", "\ud83d\udc4d", "Unfortunately, the bins are property of the trash company, so I can't drill into them. I'm thinking bungie cords - around the bin below the lid to create an anchor point, then across the lid to hold it down. Bonus that it would stop the lids blowing open in the wind and deter the wildlife.", "If that plastic bag should break and leave residue are you going to come and wash it out ?", "I have to pay directly to have my trash taken and I pay by the volume of the can. Putting stuff in my cans is literally stealing space in the can from me, in a very direct and real sense. They won't taken an *overfull* can because *to them* that's me trying to steal capacity when I could get a bigger can or extra can from the trash hauler. Consequently, any trash a rando puts in my can leaves less of the space I pay for for *my* trash.\n\nPutting your trash in my can is stealing from me and people who do it are assholes.

I don't want my backyard to reek because someone dropped an open poop bag in my trashcan and it got everywhere in there.", "Our trash cans are near our porch, and I wouldn't want the smell of dog poop or anything wafting up. We've cleaned our cans, and we notice they get funky.", "People who don't want literal shit all over it? I don't see how that's weird, especially as some people don't leave their cans outside and keep them in their garage instead. Don't really want my garage to smell like dog shit.", "ME!

Is there an earthquake to spread it around? If someone ties the bag shut and gently places it in, how would it move about? Those bags are fairly resilient; how would one break?"]}
