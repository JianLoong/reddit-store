Good on you for making a report, maybe next time he\u2019ll think twice.", "NTA- should of called the cops", "NTA. We live in a world where people should know about service animals.

You are on the floor of a store, I am assuming appearing distressed due to your medical episode, and they see a dog wearing a vest laying on you and they...don't ask if you need help, if you are okay, anything expressing concern for you well-being?

Tell me it isn't so. This should absolutely be reported.", "NTA. So much to unpack here\u2026 He threatened you with severe bodily harm when you asked him not to pet your medical service dog. That, in and of itself, is a huuuuge red flag. Then he freaked out and begged you not to call the cops? While you\u2019re in the midst of a medial issue yourself? Guy has a record, I\u2019d bet.
