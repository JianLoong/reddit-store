Not everyone can plan/predict when they need the bathroom.", ">he's gotten angry because he's not a little kid. \n\n\"I agree, you aren't a little kid. Which is why you need to behave in a responsible manner: your sister has a medical problem. Unfortunately, we only have one bathroom which means that *we* have to do what we can to ensure that we use the bathroom *before* she starts taking her treatment or *after* she finishes. And right now, you have demonstrated that you are not able to predict your bathroom needs ahead of time. And that's fine! That doesn't make you a little kid, that doesn't make you a bad person, that just means that--for right now--you need to make decisions based on the fact that you *can't* predict. And in this case, the best way to ensure that you will not need the bathroom *during* her bath is to make sure to go *before* her bath. So I'm asking you to be a mature and responsible person and use the bathroom when asked. Can you be mature and responsible about this?\"\n\nNTA. If your son wants to be treated like an adult, he needs to act like one. And while his issues with the bathroom are not his fault (any more than your daughter's pain is her fault), that doesn't absolve him of the responsibility to find a way to cope with his problem.", "INFO: Perhaps this is obvious, but it seems to maybe need to be asked/said, is there only one bathroom in your house? Given that her condition is so severe, have you requested through insurance another bathroom?", "He should go to toilet and pee or poo before the sister goes in, even if that's just for a bit then later he can hold it , he's 15 not 5.

I also have a son with ADHD.  We openly discuss his issues and how it affects his life, how his meds make him feel, etc.  We to have the discussion on bathrooms.  As someone else noted we discussed and I truly believe he has a very difficult time recognizing the \u201csigns\u201d that he is going to have to go other than when it is immediate need to go.  We do things like go before we leave for long trips, etc.  What is your son\u2019s reaction to those things?  In addition to the other suggestions on approaching the discussion maybe treat it as \u201cyou know when we go on trips everyone has to try before we leave, due to sister\u2019s ,. . .\u201d And having only one bathroom we have to treat this the same way.", "Okay, I'm not going to pass judgment here because I don't understand how the ADHD can cause such significant bathroom problems, and therefore, it's obvious that I'm missing something. \n\nBut have you considered a heating pad for the endometriosis pain? It might not be as effective as a full bath, but it may help free up the bathroom some of the time.\n\nThere are also air activated disposable heat packs that she can wear around and not be tethered to a heating pad cord or stuck in the tub for hours.", "What stands out to me is that he's also demonstrating those urinary habits at school, where your daughter is a non-factor.  So, he needs more than just an alternative home solution.   \nHe needs more guidance and protocol and sadly, you're the only one who can really help train him in that regard.  Are you able to have a pediatrician/child psychologist/maybe even a urologist speak into this as well?  NTA.", "INFO: Are you seeking professional attention for your son's difficulty with bathroom functions? \n\nAs a short-term measure, NTA, it makes perfect sense for you to make him use the bathroom before your daughter needs to use it. He may have an initial frustrated response at being treated like a child; instead you should try to help him understand that even if he doesn't feel he needs to go, peeing anyway or at least trying is a courtesy to his sister so that he won't have to disrupt her later. \n\nThere is something odd about him having an emergency bathroom situation EVERY TIME she's using the bath, esp if he insisted moments before that he didn't need to go. But these are unusual circumstances and perhaps a big part of the issue is that your daughter needs hours in the tub, which commandeers the bathroom for an excessively long time. On that note, it sounds like you are seeking medical help for her too but I have to acknowledge this does not feel like a sustainable situation for a variety of reasons.", "You can solve this with a bed pan.", "INFO: has anyone discussed birth control pills for your daughter as a way of helping with her menstrual pain? This is what my doctor put me on for severe pain during my periods when I also had endometriosis, it helped me. I know there is some thought that it's not helpful,  but it was for me. And it's a low-cost, low-risk attempt at help. Her gynecologist   will have more info (and she should see a gyn, not just a pediatrician). good luck to all of you!", "Ur not the AH. Would it be perfect if you lived in a mansion and had 34 bathrooms? Sure. But at the end of the day, the reality of the situation is that you have one bathroom to rectify this unfortunate situation. As long as you are looking for other ways to help her and make this a temporary measure, then you are in the right.\n\nI am very disappointed to see the number of people poor-shaming in this comment section. You must judge the situation off on the reality of the situation not what would be nice like another bathroom or more resources for better doctors, and more appointments.", "NAH. You're doing your best with an absolutely fucked situation. I think getting a camping toilet is the best option in the meantime. And to just keep focused on finding solutions, all of you deserve better.", "Uh, why the hell can't people use the toilet while she's in the bath? I've taken super long baths regularly in my lifetime to help with cramps and injuries, and someone will just knock on the door and come in if they need the toilet. Do you not have a shower curtain? Or a towel she can hold over herself?\n\nSimultaneous YTA and NAH.", "Ooh fun okay, I have both Endo and ASD so I feel for both your son and your daughter on this one. NTA, sorry all y\u2019all in the comments acting like the daughter should just be SOL and unable to use the bathroom to ease her excruciating, contraction during labor level, 12/10 pain. Y\u2019all suck and hate women. Camping toilet is a good idea, so is the 15yo simply using the bathroom before she goes in there.", "YTA.  Your decisions about all this are harming both kids.\n\nYour daughter needs a second opinion from different doctors if \"go sit in a boiling bath for hours every day\" is the only solution you've gotten for her pain. \n\nNo one gets to monopolize the bathroom in a house where there's only **one.** When you decided to just roll with the idea of your daughter being in there for hours a day, you should have started the search for a new place.\n\nEven a portable urinal or camping toilet would be an improvement over what you're demanding of your son.  But that's almost as ridiculous, you don't seem to care at all about anyone's needs but your daughter.", "Not really going to comment about the daughter as it\u2019s a medical condition I have no knowledge of, you mention insurance so I\u2019m assuming you have to pay for anything medical so I wouldn\u2019t pretend to know that route either. \n\nHowever I will comment as someone with a similar bladder problem and ADHD (although without the further cognitive issues you mention). It is a horrible situation, my father used to take long baths and would ask me if I needed to loo before he went for one, could more or less guarantee I wouldn\u2019t then, I\u2019d even try and couldn\u2019t do anything, but after 30-45mins I\u2019d need to pee with a matter of urgency. I used to just go in the garden in the end which was never ideal and not something I really relished doing. You\u2019re a bit stuck but for the moment the best go between I would suggest is maybe a sports drinks bottle that he could pee into in his own room in privacy? They have wide lids that can be unscrewed so he can literally just place his bits in there and no spillage worries, lid can be screwed back on after to avoid smells and it can be poured down the toilet when your daughter is done.", "They sell portable little potties. I think you need one.", "NTA for enforcing the piss before a bath thing because, in my opinion, if your daughter has endometriosis severe enough to have morphine injections then I\u2019m an advocate for sitting in a boiling bathtub and your son needs to learn how to manage his bladder.", "I\u2019m have adhd. That\u2019s not an excuse for that \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f tell him to pee before she gets in even if he doesn\u2019t feel the need to", "NTA. Worst case scenario, tell your son to piss in a bottle or something if he forgot to pee lol. I feel like endo should be priority this time around. This is coming from a guy with adhd himself who does the same thing and procrastinates peeing all the time.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Your son has to learn to manage his ADHD issues. Going to the bathroom before your daughter takes a bath is an easy thing he can do to help cope with his condition. It doesn't matter if he thinks it's childish, he has to learn to cope. I'm not sure how he thinks his day to day life is going to go if he never learns how to manage his bladder. There's going to be loads of situations where he's not going to have immediate access to a restroom. He has to learn to cope, and take steps to address this issue.", "YTA\nYou have two children with needs/issues they cannot change, but only show compassion for one. It sounds like every adult in your sons life is compounding the shame and stress he's feeling around his bathroom habits - including you.", "NTA. If your son wants to avoid being treated as incapable, he needs to start demonstrating some level of basic capability. ADHD or not, he's 15. It's one thing to not notice his bodily needs until they become urgent. It's quite another to fail to notice his own weakness in the area and to plan accordingly.\n\nAlso...just give him an empty soda bottle.\n\nAs for your daughter, she needs a uterine ablation or something...unfortunately she probably won't be able to get it, because the medical establishment seems more interested in preserving fertility than in anything relating to quality of life when it comes to women and girls.", "Buy a portable toilet, ask if he can use the toilet while she's in the bath, siblings can share like that, have a bedpan. There are so many possible solutions, but imo just having them both use it at the same time is by far the most sensible.\n\nBut YTA for thinking this can be forced through, he has a permanent mental disability that can be just as devastating as a physical one. They both need the bathroom at the same time, you need to find a solution to that.", "As someone with ADHD myself may I introduce a solution?\n\nMake it a routine that he goes on the toilet when your daughter needs to take a bath. Enforce it at first but you'll see change in the long run. You can also write it down and display it. That should help both.\n\nYou could also designate a \"Pissarea\" for warmer days as a compromise. \n\nAnd: you kinda are TA, threats help no one. He'll only resent you and your daughter might as well.", "I'm going with NTA as you seem a bit overwhelmed with 2 kids that both have issues that need constant attention. One, look into portable potties, not the outhouse kind but there are literal portable potties. Urinating in the kitchen sink is unreasonable, unsanitary and just not a good thing for everyone in the house. Secondly, look into therapies for endometriosis, get a 2nd opinion. I have a very close relative with it and there are therapies that can help your daughter instead of being in the bathroom for hours at a time. Try to hang in there and find solutions that work for both children and the rest of the household.", "NAH but you need to think outside the box. I\u2019d actually be focused more on other options for your daughter. Hours in the bath isn\u2019t conducive to living her life. Has she tried an electric blanket? Heating pad? At least then she could do homework or game or something while waiting for the pain to subside. \n\nFor the son, sit down with him and try to talk out a plan. It makes sense to ask him to pee before her bath, but give him an active role in getting to a solution. Pick a time when you\u2019re both calm, have some snacks or something, and chat about it.", "op please get a second/3rd/4th opinion for your daughter still to this day womens medical issues are very misunderstood and often played down by doctors and i dont think training your son to pee even at his age is a bad thing we all go to the toilet before we leave the house just incase so its a good habit to instill in him but you do need a solution for everyone 1st your daughter then a second toilet ... just because", "YTA, your bad decision is affecting both kids. You need to see a doctor for her pain.   \n\n\nWhat I DON'T like is you only show compassion for your daughter, you need a 2nd bathroom or a doctor. It shouldn't be where your daughter stays in the bath for hours and your son is holding it and pissing himself because of your decision.", "YTA because to be fair, you can't expect anyone to not use the bathroom for several hours. You can't support one child by neglecting the other. Find a solution.", "YTA for not being able to work out an easy compromise.\n\nHe's a guy.  He can piss in pretty much anything, and you can then dump it down the toilet later.\n\nWhy are you forcing him to hold it, instead of peeing in a bottle???", "Why doesn't he just pee in a jar? NAH", "YTA already for taking your daughter\u2019s medical condition and needs seriously while minimizing your son\u2019s medical condition and needs. Both of your children require accommodation, not just one. And it is completely reasonable to need general access to a toilet. Even prisoners get a toilet in their cells.\n\nMaking an adolescent urinate himself is completely unacceptable. It is totally unreasonable to expect him to be able to time his physical needs around your daughter\u2019s hours-per-day bath schedule.\n\nHave you considered offering your son other options? For example, can you provide him a cup or container he can urinate in while your daughter bathes? Then your son can dump it in the toilet for flushing when it is available. Whether it\u2019s this idea or not, you have an obligation to be creative enough to provide for both your children. Trying to enforce a narrow time window for your son to relieve himself is not the answer. \n\nTBH, given that he is pushed to the point of crying for using the toilet or wetting himself to avoid your verbal assaults makes it seem like he may already be in an abusive situation, and your plan would only worsen that possible abuse. Your son deserves comfort, respect, and dignity as much as your daughter, and you are failing to provide those for him in order to shame and traumatize him for having basic bodily needs.\n\nThat said, are you sure your son\u2019s bathroom issues are ADHD related? Is it possible he has another medical condition that is responsible for sudden urges to micturate? If you aren\u2019t sure, he should probably see a doctor. Either way, you need to do better by him.", "YTA. They both have medical conditions, but you're allowing your daughter to take control of the bathroom for hours at a time. He might not need the toilet when asked, but if she's there for hours, he's gonna have to disturb her at some point. You need to do better as the parent.", "YTA, holding urine can cause issues. I'm 35, but if I was a kid without access to the bathroom for hours, I would be stressed and frustrated. \n\nIf I were your son, I would feel like you were catering to her illness and punishing mine. \n\nFind a solution that doesn't include monopolizing the bathroom for hours at a time or get a second place to pee. I can't imagine living like this every day. Everyone should have access to the bathroom.\n\nEta: it's not fair he's pissing in your plants?

Imagine having a hard time with knowing when to go to the bathroom and your parent yells at you and berates you and you have your own internal guilt for disrupting your sister that at 15 you wet yourself because there are no other options available. I think its perfectly reasonable to ask him to just go anyway before she gets in the tub but I am deeply deeply concerned for how little regard you have for his struggles. I have to vote YTA because it should have never gotten to this point, idk pay your neighbor to use their bathroom.", "YTA \n\nthey both have medical issues", "NAH but easily verging on YTA. \n\nWhy can\u2019t he just pee in the yard? Seems like a perfectly fine solution. Seems silly that he\u2019s in tears and holding it  when he could just go outside. \n\nHe should be attempting to go to the bathroom first, and he should start working on understanding his bodily cues better. However he\u2019s still young, and it\u2019s not typical for a sibling to spend SO much time in one bathroom. It\u2019s sounding a little like favoritism, and your son is probably feeling that way too. You need to be looking at long term solutions, because it\u2019s unreasonable to have your daughter take up the bathroom for that long.

Like, without a second bathroom there\u2019s going to be issues. Also, have you thought of rather than another bathroom, maybe investing in a hot tub of some sorts for your daughter? Because while I feel terribly for what your daughters going through, it\u2019s absolutely not fair that no one else is allowed to use the bathroom during this time. \n\nReally, your options are limited. You could move to a new housing situation with two bathrooms, you could add a bathroom to your place, or you could buy a hot tub, they even have inflatable ones.

It\u2019s 2023, you being so conservative when a family shares a bathroom is just mystifying the opposite sex to your kids. We all pee, poo, fart and bleed. Maybe he\u2019ll sit on the toilet and chat with her while she\u2019s all alone. \nMaybe find a small privacy partition and they can grab a tablet and watch something together. Just set the rule that your daughter gets to claim her space back if she needs some quite etc. \n\nShit set up some pillows on the floor next to the tub so she can have some company. \n\nIt will make your kids better partners, roommates and friends in the future. \nImagine your son hearing a gal pal has endometriosis an is in pain. Teach him to be the guy that shows up with snacks and says \u201cget in the tub, this works for my sister every time, I got you\u201d \nInstead of the guy that rolls his eyes when a woman says she has cramps.\n\nIt will make your daughter feel less isolated and less like her medical condition isn\u2019t a disruption to the household. She won\u2019t feel embarrassed to tell a future roomate or partner what she needs to feel better. She\u2019s a queen with endo and sometimes that requires us to hold court while we\u2019re in the tub!\n\nIt will teach your son how important it is to have empathy for the women in his life. I have Endo and severe ADHD. I too forget to pee. It\u2019s humiliating. \n\nSome of the most helpful people in my life when I\u2019ve been in pain were guys who have sisters with similar problems. \nI have experiences like being on a trip with a coed group, waking up crying and having a guy friend wake up and spoon me knowing their body heat would help me.

But your real problem is your daughter's medical issue.  I would be working on this with a doctor if it is so life limiting.  Spending hours in a bathtub days on end to function for a young teen is not remotely normal.\n\nYou can force him to go and he still may need to go in 60-90 minutes and that isn't unreasonable.  That said, peeing in a private back yard is not a big deal to me.  Or get a camp toliet.  Your 15 year old has a documented disability that affects planning.  Why are you prioritizing your daughter's issues over your son's?\n\nIt's not fair your daughter is greatly limiting bathroom use for the rest of the family either.  Empathy goes both ways.

I get being grossed out by peeing in the sink, but depending on the situation, it\u2019s not unreasonable.  I\u2019m sure there are urinal type products that you can store in your house that can be emptied into the toilet later.  My toddler has one for potty training.

You sound more sympathetic to your daughter. You kind of make it sound like your son is willfully being difficult. You have to respect his autonomy too, and really your plants are so much less important than making your child feel horrible and pee himself. \n\nI hope BOTH your kids are getting help for their conditions, your son needs helps too.

American health cares a fucking joke at times. \n\nAnd no just taking painkillers will do much. It's an internal pain and issue and scar tissue laughs at pain killers most times.", "I paid for her diagnosis. They don't cover it. The only thing they cover is a hysterectomy, but she won't have one. They didn't even cover her getting the diagnosis. I am trying to get her treatment.", "This seems very reasonable. He could even set a timer for every few hours. Haven\u2019t been to the bathroom in three hours? Ok go try and squeeze something out. Sister about to get in the bath? Go just try to pee while you have the chance.", "Totally, I said something similar in another comment. This is real, but unfortunately something he needs to learn to deal with. But shaming him isn't the way.", "Yes exactly", "I don't know. These are the options I'm being given. I'm trying to help her.", "I also can not use the bathroom for hours. Its not fun, but its the situation we're in.", "They can splatter unless the pee-er is very conscientious.", "Unfortunately we have no fences and it rains a lot. He has exposed himself to the neighbours a few times now, which nobody is enjoying.", "I don't agree with this. OP asking her son to pee first is her looking out for him. He refuses, which leads to a stressful situation for everybody. OP's son needs to be responsible for his condition. He knows he can't predict when he needs to use the restroom, and OP came up with a possible solution to alleviate stress for all those involved. If he pees before his sister bathes, he's less likely to have an emergency. \n\nOP also said sister has no problem getting out to let him pee as long as she has been in for about an hour. So OP's son really only has to hold his bladder for an hour. Peeing before she gets in is a super easy way to avoid an emergency. Him refusing to do this is not okay, because he's not accepting any responsibility for his condition and trying to manage it. \n\nOP even said it's an issue at school too. He has to learn to manage it, because he will not have free access to a restroom his entire life. There's going to be situations where he needs to hold his pee for an hour or more. OP's not rejecting his needs by making him pee before his sister bathes. If anything, she's trying to teach him essential coping skills he will need throughout his life.", "Ya I don\u2019t get it. Even if the bathroom doesn\u2019t have a curtain rod and it\u2019s a rental that they can\u2019t put holes in the walls they sell expanding ones that don\u2019t need screws.", "I agree with this. He might not be able to help that he can't tell he has to pee until he really has to go, but there is no reason he shouldn't be trying to pee before his sister takes her bath. The mom has literally asked him to and he refuses. He's contributing to his own issue instead of trying to find healthy ways to cope.", "Ha. Okay. Sure thing, doctor. Not sure how going to the bathroom before his sister is \"berating\" the boy.", "Not ALL insurance won't pay.\n\nI paid like $200 tops for my endo surgery\n I had tubes and and an ablation at the same time. Also in the US.\n\nBut yes the insurance situation in the US is broken and unfair", "Hey, hope you'll see this. DO NOT do a hysterectomy at this young age. If doctors told you it was the only solution it is not. My (specialized) doctors told me they can't do that (I'm 27) because it'll create a lot of problems with my bones and all. Basically I'll have a 65 yo body. BUT PLEASE put your daughter on non(estrogen birth control (progesteron) it should stop her menstrual cycle. They never took care of my endometriosis (apparently i didnt have it ?? while not doing any exams) and now I have 20 cm of endometriosis kysts on my ovaries, fun times really", "The only way to truly diagnose endometriosis is through surgery.", "Woah there is a lot to try before a hysterectomy, she is young but if the pain is that bad have they done an ablation treatment yet (it removes the tissue that causes the pain) and tried birth control/Progestin to stop the growth?", "Are there any support groups where you could get some ideas? Maybe also consider looking in Eastern and alternative medicine to help if your current doctors aren't helping?", "Absolutely not!  I had stage 3 endo and I had laparoscopic surgery 3 times to remove the endometriosis adhesions in my abdomen using lasers which helped me tremendously.  She absolutely does not need a hysterectomy, especially at her age!  No good doctor would say that is her only option.  Good lord.  A Mirena IUD placed after surgery could help to eventually stop or lighten subsequent periods after surgery so it slows endo coming back.  You need a second/third opinion, this doctor is an absolute HACK.  But your daughter needs surgery YESTERDAY to get rid of the endo growing throughout her body before it gets any worse!", "Have you considered hanging a shower curtain around the tub? Then both you and your son won\u2019t need to hold your pee for hours on end. Everyone gets privacy.", "Yes but unless I\u2019m missing something YOU don\u2019t have a disability that causes you to not understand your bodily needs, and can plan accordingly. Not knowing that you\u2019re hungry, have to pee, have to poop, have to drink etc. is awful. It\u2019s scary, frustrating, and really hard to deal with. I have adhd and I\u2019m autistic and I used to pass out constantly because I never realized I was hungry. I would go days without eating because I just never understood that I was needing it. Im 26 and STILL struggle with it. He\u2019s not choosing to be unaware, yes he should learn some coping mechanisms but he\u2019s still just a kid.\n\nDo you believe your sons ADHD is a real disability? Because it kind of seems like you don\u2019t. You\u2019re only willing to accommodate one child. I think it says a lot that you didn\u2019t even realize there were camping toilets. Almost like you haven\u2019t tried helping him at all and thinks if he just *tries* his adhd will go away. You only seem interesting in accommodating one child\u2019s medical issues. Your son is going to start noticing that if he hasn\u2019t already.", "Absolutely true. Still, used in a place where a little spatter isn't a big deal, it could be cheaper than a thingumy toilet. Bedpan + garden must be better than just garden, right?", "It\u2019s fine for you to not agree. I\u2019m not saying the son doesn\u2019t have to make improvements, I\u2019m saying that throughout everything that OP has posted and said, we hear all about how awful her daughter has it, but when it comes to her son I\u2019m not getting any sense of empathy or caring like we do for her daughter. Idk, you\u2019re allowed to have a different opinion, but I\u2019m pretty firm on this.", "I'm not a doctor, but I'm married to a therapist/social worker of 20+ years. You know what doesn't help ADHD? Shame and guilt. The OP isn't doing anything to actually help the situation and it's only going to make his symptoms worse in the long run.\n\nBut you wouldn't learn that from watching professional wrestling, so I understand your confusion.", "Right! Only one bathroom in my house as a kid, we just kept the damn curtain closed when someone was in the tub. I have two bathrooms now, and my kids still need to come into the one with the tub while I'm taking a bath, without fail every time, twice each on Saturday. Just have her close the damn shower curtain.\n\nETA: get the girl a heating pad, those can be plugged into any outlet and won't tie up your one bathroom.", "Look I get that not noticing your bodies needs is a thing and not a thing that someone with adhd can be expected to just do.  What I have a problem with is the abject refusal when someone points out the problem to you.  My son is only 5 so we\u2019re being gentle with him but it is SO frustrating to argue with him that he hasn\u2019t gone to the bathroom for hours and we are about to sit down for dinner so he needs to go potty and he just refuses.  And then he had to get up from the table or worse has an accident and he\u2019s freaking the fuck out and needing to be consoled when what I really want to say is, you should have listened to me when I spent half an hour unsuccessfully trying to convince you to fucking pee.  And then the next day comes and I\u2019m like ok buddy, remember yesterday? That was unpleasant for everyone, let\u2019s make different choices today.  And he still refuses.  I often forget to eat lunch, my body doesn\u2019t tell me I\u2019m hungry.  If someone says, hey did you eat lunch?  I go, oh wait, no I didn\u2019t.   Not I REFUSE YOU CAN\u2019T MAKE ME EAT.  Like wtf?  No matter how many times we go through the process and it is demonstrated that not taking 5 min to pee leads to half an hour of suck for everyone, he still won\u2019t go to the bathroom unless forced.", "Do you believe OP's son should never take steps to manage his condition? What quality of life do you think he's going to have if he never learns to cope with his ADHD? He's going to have tons of situations in his life where he may not have immediate access to a restroom. He's going to have to learn to cope and take steps to address his issue. The mom always tells him to pee before the daughter gets in the bath, and he doesn't. He is not taking the most basic of steps to manage his condition.", "This ^", "I get what you're saying, but she is trying to help her son. He is the one who is rejecting a solution she came up with for his sake. It's not like she is dismissing his condition, she understands he can't control it and is trying to find a solution for everyone. She isn't trying to punish him for his ADHD or dismissing it, she's trying to get him to take steps to address it. \n\nFor the record, I'd totally agree with your view if she was telling her son his ADHD wasn't important or something like that. But it really seems like she accepts the condition for what it is, and is just providing a potential solution.", "I literally said \u201cyes he should learn coping mechanism but he\u2019s still a kid.\u201d \n\nIt\u2019s the parents job to guide kids in their journey. It\u2019s not a teenagers job to do everything himself.", "Mom is guiding. She tells him to pee before his daughter bathes, and he refuses. That's on him, not her. She's asking him to take the most basic of steps towards managing his condition, and he refuses.", "That\u2019s not how that works lol", "I'm not sure what you think the solution is here. It just seems like you don't think OP's son should bear any responsibility for his condition, and shouldn't have to make an efforts to manage it."]}
