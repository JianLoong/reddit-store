Not everyone can plan/predict when they need the bathroom.", ">he's gotten angry because he's not a little kid. \n\n\"I agree, you aren't a little kid. Which is why you need to behave in a responsible manner: your sister has a medical problem. Unfortunately, we only have one bathroom which means that *we* have to do what we can to ensure that we use the bathroom *before* she starts taking her treatment or *after* she finishes. And right now, you have demonstrated that you are not able to predict your bathroom needs ahead of time. And that's fine! That doesn't make you a little kid, that doesn't make you a bad person, that just means that--for right now--you need to make decisions based on the fact that you *can't* predict. And in this case, the best way to ensure that you will not need the bathroom *during* her bath is to make sure to go *before* her bath. So I'm asking you to be a mature and responsible person and use the bathroom when asked. Can you be mature and responsible about this?\"\n\nNTA. If your son wants to be treated like an adult, he needs to act like one. And while his issues with the bathroom are not his fault (any more than your daughter's pain is her fault), that doesn't absolve him of the responsibility to find a way to cope with his problem.", "INFO: Perhaps this is obvious, but it seems to maybe need to be asked/said, is there only one bathroom in your house? Given that her condition is so severe, have you requested through insurance another bathroom?", "He should go to toilet and pee or poo before the sister goes in, even if that's just for a bit then later he can hold it , he's 15 not 5. Ppl don't go toilet only when it's emergency he must learn that", "Work on finding the best way to approach your soon about his ADHD in general so he doesn\u2019t take is as a personal attack but a growth opportunity, you recognizing that he is growing up and not a kid and you helping him to be grown up.   I also have a son with ADHD.  We openly discuss his issues and how it affects his life, how his meds make him feel, etc.  We too had to have the discussion on bathrooms.  As someone else noted, we discussed and I truly believe, he has a very difficult time recognizing the \u201csigns\u201d that he is going to have to go other than when it is immediate need to go.  We do things like go before we leave for long trips, etc.  What is your son\u2019s reaction to those things?  In addition to the other suggestions on approaching the discussion maybe treat it as \u201cyou know when we go on trips everyone has to try before we leave, due to sister\u2019s ,. . .\u201d And having only one bathroom we have to treat this the same way.", "Okay, I'm not going to pass judgment here because I don't understand how the ADHD can cause such significant bathroom problems, and therefore, it's obvious that I'm missing something. \n\nBut have you considered a heating pad for the endometriosis pain? It might not be as effective as a full bath, but it may help free up the bathroom some of the time.\n\nThere are also air activated disposable heat packs that she can wear around and not be tethered to a heating pad cord or stuck in the tub for hours.", "What stands out to me is that he's also demonstrating those urinary habits at school, where your daughter is a non-factor.  So, he needs more than just an alternative home solution.   \nHe needs more guidance and protocol and sadly, you're the only one who can really help train him in that regard.  Are you able to have a pediatrician/child psychologist/maybe even a urologist speak into this as well?  NTA.", "INFO: Are you seeking professional attention for your son's difficulty with bathroom functions? \n\nAs a short-term measure, NTA, it makes perfect sense for you to make him use the bathroom before your daughter needs to use it. He may have an initial frustrated response at being treated like a child; instead you should try to help him understand that even if he doesn't feel he needs to go, peeing anyway or at least trying is a courtesy to his sister so that he won't have to disrupt her later. \n\nThere is something odd about him having an emergency bathroom situation EVERY TIME she's using the bath, esp if he insisted moments before that he didn't need to go. But these are unusual circumstances and perhaps a big part of the issue is that your daughter needs hours in the tub, which commandeers the bathroom for an excessively long time. On that note, it sounds like you are seeking medical help for her too but I have to acknowledge this does not feel like a sustainable situation for a variety of reasons.", "You can solve this with a bed pan.", "INFO: has anyone discussed birth control pills for your daughter as a way of helping with her menstrual pain? This is what my doctor put me on for severe pain during my periods when I also had endometriosis, it helped me. I know there is some thought that it's not helpful,  but it was for me. And it's a low-cost, low-risk attempt at help. Her gynecologist   will have more info (and she should see a gyn, not just a pediatrician). good luck to all of you!", "Ur not the AH. Would it be perfect if you lived in a mansion and had 34 bathrooms? Sure. But at the end of the day, the reality of the situation is that you have one bathroom to rectify this unfortunate situation. As long as you are looking for other ways to help her and make this a temporary measure, then you are in the right.\n\nI am very disappointed to see the number of people poor-shaming in this comment section. You must judge the situation off on the reality of the situation not what would be nice like another bathroom or more resources for better doctors, and more appointments.", "NAH. You're doing your best with an absolutely fucked situation. I think getting a camping toilet is the best option in the meantime. And to just keep focused on finding solutions, all of you deserve better.", "Uh, why the hell can't people use the toilet while she's in the bath? I've taken super long baths regularly in my lifetime to help with cramps and injuries, and someone will just knock on the door and come in if they need the toilet. Do you not have a shower curtain? Or a towel she can hold over herself?", "Ooh fun okay, I have both Endo and ASD so I feel for both your son and your daughter on this one. NTA, sorry all y\u2019all in the comments acting like the daughter should just be SOL and unable to use the bathroom to ease her excruciating, contraction during labor level, 12/10 pain. Y\u2019all suck and hate women. Camping toilet is a good idea, so is the 15yo simply using the bathroom before she goes in there.", "YTA.  Your decisions about all this are harming both kids.\n\nYour daughter needs a second opinion from different doctors if \"go sit in a boiling bath for hours every day\" is the only solution you've gotten for her pain. \n\nNo one gets to monopolize the bathroom in a house where there's only **one.** When you decided to just roll with the idea of your daughter being in there for hours a day, you should have started the search for a new place.\n\nEven a portable urinal or camping toilet would be an improvement over what you're demanding of your son.  But that's almost as ridiculous, you don't seem to care at all about anyone's needs but your daughter (and not enough there if you're accepting the poor medical advice you've been given).", "Not really going to comment about the daughter as it\u2019s a medical condition I have no knowledge of, you mention insurance so I\u2019m assuming you have to pay for anything medical so I wouldn\u2019t pretend to know that route either. \n\nHowever I will comment as someone with a similar bladder problem and ADHD (although without the further cognitive issues you mention). It is a horrible situation, my father used to take long baths and would ask me if I needed to loo before he went for one, could more or less guarantee I wouldn\u2019t then, I\u2019d even try and couldn\u2019t do anything, but after 30-45mins I\u2019d need to pee with a matter of urgency. I used to just go in the garden in the end which was never ideal and not something I really relished doing. You\u2019re a bit stuck but for the moment the best go between I would suggest is maybe a sports drinks bottle that he could pee into in his own room in privacy? They have wide lids that can be unscrewed so he can literally just place his bits in there and no spillage worries, lid can be screwed back on after to avoid smells and it can be poured down the toilet when your daughter is done.", "They sell portable little potties. I think you need one.", "NTA for enforcing the piss before a bath thing because, in my opinion, if your daughter has endometriosis severe enough to have morphine injections then I\u2019m an advocate for sitting in a boiling bathtub and your son needs to learn how to manage his bladder.", "I\u2019m have adhd. That\u2019s not an excuse for that \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f tell him to pee before she gets in even if he doesn\u2019t feel the need to", "NTA. Worst case scenario, tell your son to piss in a bottle or something if he forgot to pee lol. I feel like endo should be priority this time around. This is coming from a guy with adhd himself who does the same thing and procrastinates peeing all the time.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Your son has to learn to manage his ADHD issues. Going to the bathroom before your daughter takes a bath is an easy thing he can do to help cope with his condition. It doesn't matter if he thinks it's childish, he has to learn to cope. I'm not sure how he thinks his day to day life is going to go if he never learns how to manage his bladder. There's going to be loads of situations where he's not going to have immediate access to a restroom. He has to learn to cope, and take steps to address this issue.", "YTA\nYou have two children with needs/issues they cannot change, but only show compassion for one. It sounds like every adult in your sons life is compounding the shame and stress he's feeling around his bathroom habits - including you.", "NTA. If your son wants to avoid being treated as incapable, he needs to start demonstrating some level of basic capability. ADHD or not, he's 15. It's one thing to not notice his bodily needs until they become urgent. It's quite another to fail to notice his own weakness in the area and to plan accordingly.\n\nAlso...just give him an empty soda bottle.\n\nAs for your daughter, she needs a uterine ablation or something...unfortunately she probably won't be able to get it, because the medical establishment seems more interested in preserving fertility than in anything relating to quality of life when it comes to women and girls.", "Buy a portable toilet, ask if he can use the toilet while she's in the bath, siblings can share like that, have a bedpan. There are so many possible solutions, but imo just having them both use it at the same time is by far the most sensible.\n\nBut YTA for thinking this can be forced through, he has a permanent mental disability that can be just as devastating as a physical one. They both need the bathroom at the same time, you need to find a solution to that.", "As someone with ADHD myself may I introduce a solution?\n\nMake it a routine that he goes on the toilet when your daughter needs to take a bath. Enforce it at first but you'll see change in the long run. You can also write it down and display it. That should help both.\n\nYou could also designate a \"Pissarea\" for warmer days as a compromise. \n\nAnd: you kinda are TA, threats help no one. He'll only resent you and your daughter might as well.", "I'm going with NTA as you seem a bit overwhelmed with 2 kids that both have issues that need constant attention. One, look into portable potties, not the outhouse kind but there are literal portable potties. Urinating in the kitchen sink is unreasonable, unsanitary and just not a good thing for everyone in the house. Secondly, look into therapies for endometriosis, get a 2nd opinion. I have a very close relative with it and there are therapies that can help your daughter instead of being in the bathroom for hours at a time. Try to hang in there and find solutions that work for both children and the rest of the household.", "NAH but you need to think outside the box. I\u2019d actually be focused more on other options for your daughter. Hours in the bath isn\u2019t conducive to living her life. Has she tried an electric blanket? Heating pad? At least then she could do homework or game or something while waiting for the pain to subside. \n\nFor the son, sit down with him and try to talk out a plan. It makes sense to ask him to pee before her bath, but give him an active role in getting to a solution. Pick a time when you\u2019re both calm, have some snacks or something, and chat about it.", "op please get a second/3rd/4th opinion for your daughter still to this day womens medical issues are very misunderstood and often played down by doctors and i dont think training your son to pee even at his age is a bad thing we all go to the toilet before we leave the house just incase so its a good habit to instill in him but you do need a solution for everyone 1st your daughter then a second toilet ... just because", "[deleted]", "YTA because to be fair, you can't expect anyone to not use the bathroom for several hours. You can't support one child by neglecting the other. Find a solution.", "YTA for not being able to work out an easy compromise.\n\nHe's a guy.  He can piss in pretty much anything, and you can then dump it down the toilet later.\n\nWhy are you forcing him to hold it, instead of peeing in a bottle???", "Why doesn't he just pee in a jar? NAH", "YTA already for taking your daughter\u2019s medical condition and needs seriously while minimizing your son\u2019s medical condition and needs. Both of your children require accommodation, not just one. And it is completely reasonable to need general access to a toilet. Even prisoners get a toilet in their cells.\n\nMaking an adolescent urinate himself is completely unacceptable. It is totally unreasonable to expect him to be able to time his physical needs around your daughter\u2019s hours-per-day bath schedule.\n\nHave you considered offering your son other options? For example, can you provide him a cup or container he can urinate in while your daughter bathes? Then your son can dump it in the toilet for flushing when it is available. Whether it\u2019s this idea or not, you have an obligation to be creative enough to provide for both your children. Trying to enforce a narrow time window for your son to relieve himself is not the answer. \n\nTBH, given that he is pushed to the point of crying for using the toilet or wetting himself to avoid your verbal assaults makes it seem like he may already be in an abusive situation, and your plan would only worsen that possible abuse. Your son deserves comfort, respect, and dignity as much as your daughter, and you are failing to provide those for him in order to shame and traumatize him for having basic bodily needs.\n\nThat said, are you sure your son\u2019s bathroom issues are ADHD related? Is it possible he has another medical condition that is responsible for sudden urges to micturate? If you aren\u2019t sure, he should probably see a doctor. Either way, you need to do better by him.", "YTA. They both have medical conditions, but you're allowing your daughter to take control of the bathroom for hours at a time.

I'm 35, but if I was a kid without access to the bathroom for hours, I would be stressed and frustrated. \n\nIf I were your son, I would feel like you were catering to her illness and punishing mine. \n\nFind a solution that doesn't include monopolizing the bathroom for hours at a time or get a second place to pee. I can't imagine living like this every day. Everyone should have access to the bathroom.\n\nEta: it's not fair he's pissing in your plants?

Imagine having a hard time with knowing when to go to the bathroom and your parent yells at you and berates you and you have your own internal guilt for disrupting your sister that at 15 you wet yourself because there are no other options available. I think its perfectly reasonable to ask him to just go anyway before she gets in the tub but I am deeply deeply concerned for how little regard you have for his struggles.

Maybe he\u2019ll sit on the toilet and chat with her while she\u2019s all alone. \nMaybe find a small privacy partition and they can grab a tablet and watch something together. Just set the rule that your daughter gets to claim her space back if she needs some quite etc. \n\nShit set up some pillows on the floor next to the tub so she can have some company. \n\nIt will make your kids better partners, roommates and friends in the future. \nImagine your son hearing a gal pal has endometriosis an is in pain. Teach him to be the guy that shows up with snacks and says \u201cget in the tub, this works for my sister every time, I got you\u201d \nInstead of the guy that rolls his eyes when a woman says she has cramps.\n\nIt will make your daughter feel less isolated and less like her medical condition isn\u2019t a disruption to the household. She won\u2019t feel embarrassed to tell a future roomate or partner what she needs to feel better. She\u2019s a queen with endo and sometimes that requires us to hold court while we\u2019re in the tub!\n\nIt will teach your son how important it is to have empathy for the women in his life. I have Endo and severe ADHD. I too forget to pee. It\u2019s humiliating. \n\nSome of the most helpful people in my life when I\u2019ve been in pain were guys who have sisters with similar problems. \nI have experiences like being on a trip with a coed group, waking up crying and having a guy friend wake up and spoon me knowing their body heat would help me. Totally platonic and their partner was there and totally supportive they took turns for 2 hours until we could get the pain managed.", "Why cant he just go in an pee while the shower curtain is closed?", "NAH.  But your real problem is your daughter's medical issue.  I would be working on this with a doctor if it is so life limiting.  Spending hours in a bathtub days on end to function for a young teen is not remotely normal.\n\nYou can force him to go and he still may need to go in 60-90 minutes and that isn't unreasonable.

Why are you prioritizing your daughter's issues over your son's?\n\nIt's not fair your daughter is greatly limiting bathroom use for the rest of the family either.  Empathy goes both ways.  You are the adult in the room.

Especially if he\u2019s drinking a lot of water on a hot summer day.  I\u2019d probably also look at alternatives for him.  Peeing outside is the easiest.  Might not be ideal but it could work.   I get being grossed out by peeing in the sink, but depending on the situation, it\u2019s not unreasonable.  I\u2019m sure there are urinal type products that you can store in your house that can be emptied into the toilet later.  My toddler has one for potty training.

You sound more sympathetic to your daughter. You kind of make it sound like your son is willfully being difficult.

However, this issue isn\u2019t as simple as that. It\u2019s a great first step, but one of the nuances of this issue is that he may go before she gets in the tub, not pee much, then realize 15 minutes later he has to go again and REALLY need it this time. \n\nI understand he has a therapist, but do they work on neurodivergence and interoception issues specifically? If it\u2019s happening at school, too, he likely has greater difficulty understanding his bodily clues considering all the other stimuli at school \u2014 teachers, students, colors, fonts, screens, sounds, etc. \n\nInfo: At home, is he usually in the middle of a task when he\u2019s asked if he needs the restroom? If he\u2019s engrossed in something (homework, video games, etc) it\u2019s gonna be even harder for him to recognize his bodily needs.

He's going to have to go places and do things where he will not have immediate access to a restroom. He has to learn to cope and manage this condition.

I work with adults with disabilities and this is something that helps them remain independent in that area even if they have lost the ability to tell when they need to use the toilet. Timed toileting means creating a schedule with specific times to use the bathroom. To encourage his independence and reinforce that he is not a little kid, encourage him to create the schedule and come up with the times. For example it could be every 2 hours  he uses the bathroom and tries to go. It may not need to be that often and can be adjusted. He can utilize the alarm on his phone or smart watch if he has one to remind him of the times he should use the toilet. This should help prevent any more emergency situations.", "NTA.

Sounds like he has RSV as well, so structuring your speech is highly important. One wrong phrase will sound like an attack to him, instead try and phrase it as someone needs help. Phrasing is incredibly important in managing how he reacts. Remember, ADHD is spectrum autism. Also, I would get him a therapist to teach him coping skills and how to process information to manage his own emotions. This is probably the most important thing. If he doesn't learn to control his emotions, he's never going to last at any endeavor. As far as memory goes, nothing can really help that. We just aren't wired that way.

Or simply get him a portable male urinal that he can use in his room that he can empty into the toilet when his sister is finished.  You could use any container for this but by using a urinal bottle that's made for this purpose, he'll probably use just that and not any random container that he'll take into his room (just pre empting a potential new problem if you take this method).\n\nNo he can't pee in the sink.

By OP asking him if he needs to pee she is reminding him that it is something he needs to do and advising him that he will be unable to for approximately an hour. One hour is not to long to go without access to the bathroom especially with a forewarning. The son can 100% try and go before his sister gets in the tub and should be good for an hour after. If he refuses to try and go that is his choice, but then it is on him if he needs to go within the next hour.

It does not make him less mature. It does not make him selfish or thoughtless. It is not his fault. He cannot control this aspect of his ADHD.\n\nConflicting access needs have no easy solution, and that solution is dependent entirely upon the context. And not everyone may be satisfied with that solution. My recommendation would be to get another portable toilet like someone else suggested, and let him choose where he can put it, as not everyone feels comfortable doing their business in the same places.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Tiktun-Portable-Camping-White-Toilet-Black/dp/B09F35RBDR/ref=mp_s_a_1_8?keywords=portable%2Btoilet&qid=1682987452&sr=8-8&th=1&psc=1\n\nThis is a nice one that doesn\u2019t feel like a bucket for $50.\n\nI would like to ask you for a small favor now: Please, if you haven\u2019t already, give your son information on ADHD and interoception.
