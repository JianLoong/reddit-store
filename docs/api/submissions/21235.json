In lean times, people 'tighten their belts' financially. This means that miscellaneous expenses like eating out, vacations, and new clothes and shoes are put on the backburner while you dig yourself out of the financial hellscape you fall into. Clearly...times are not as bad for them as they led you to believe. And please, please remember this lesson that your own mother has taught you (and the famous Reddit response), don't set yourself on fire to keep others warm. Your financial stability must come first.

As a child, I would go through days of silence for not staying within the rules of my mother. Silence is a narcissistic technique used to control people.

And it's not 'subtly' trying to make you feel bad, by saying 'my partner will get mad at me because it's his money but it's OK'. That's BLATANTLY trying to guilt you, and it's very manipulative.\n\nIt's really unacceptable, after you tried to help her out of the kindness of your heart (at no benefit to yourself - the complete opposite, in fact).\nHas this generally been how your Mom acts? Because with the partner mentioned, I wonder if she's trying to please him. \n\nThere's no excuse, though. It's still pathetic to leave your own child in financial dire straits (and see your child so distressed about it), just so you can have vacations and please Mr Lover Man. She has no grounds whatsoever, to be guilting anyone. She's the one who should feel guilt.", "Thank you!  \n\n\nAlso if they're willing to put priority on another trip than try to just pay you what they owe. They're not struggling.    \n\n\nIf your mother is serious about cutting contact because they find their next trip more important than actually paying you. I agree it's better to just cut them out. They don't realize it now and maybe they'll never realize it. But making false promises will ruin family relationships.", "Just wait, your mom might hit you with the \"do you know how much money I spent on you growing up?!\"\n\nIf she hasn't done that already.", "Take them to court.  Them going on multiple vacations when they owe you money is like rubbing salt in a wound.  Screw them, go scorched earth to get your money back.  Nta", "She did not yet. And if she does even she has to know it\u2019s bs. She helped all the other siblings but never me. Even said it openly \u201cyou were always so great because even if you had problems you took care of yourself\u201d.  Yea no shit, I didn\u2019t really have a different option haha."]}
