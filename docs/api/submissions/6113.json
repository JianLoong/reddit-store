Be free and naked.", "So the issue to these women was not that their husbands were asking for photos (jokingly or otherwise, it's still not a great thing to say, especially in front of your wife!). It was the fact that your wife told them? And what details?! All I read is that she mentioned a nude beach. She didn't say you two went full Lady Godiva and then shared details about both your genitals, and she handled the picture asking comments with grace.\n\nTell your aunts, from me, that if their husbands genuinely can't control themselves, that's on them not your wife. Ask where is their accountability?\n\nYou, on the other hand, are being an excellent husband. I'm glad you're defending her, even though it's silly that you need to.\n\nNTA and don't you dare stop.", "NTA, even though your Mom and aunt are upset, its not there place to be. This is your wife\u2019s story, no there\u2019s, and she\u2019s allowed to tell how much or how little she wants. it isn\u2019t your fault that your wife is just telling the stories of your honeymoon.

Your mum does not.", "You will be an asshole if you tell your wife to tread lightly. \n\nYour mom and aunt sound like insufferable uptight snobs. If they chastise your wife for her happy adventurous spirit it will negatively effect their relationships going forward. \n\nHer seeing the men in attendance as tantalized is off, even pervy. Did they say derogatory things about your wife after you left or is this something she imagined? Either way, This is disturbing. \n\nSit your mom down and tell her you won\u2019t have it.

And what would your mom do here, where people just love to be naked \ud83d\ude02 Tell her it\u2019s very healthy to see real bodies not just in the photoshopped magazines.

I thought you were saying they were jokingly asking for pics of the nude beach in general. If they were essentially saying they wanted to see her naked and she was egging it on\u2026.

Over holiday drinks at my parents\u2019 place on Wednesday, folks asked us about our honeymoon, and we gave the usual recap. My wife also chimed in that \u201cwe even went to a nude beach!\u201d That drew some oohs and aahs and some blushed faces, and a couple people said  \u201comg please tell us about it\u201d uncles jokingly said \u201ccan you show us pictures\u201d and she laughed and said \u201csure, ask John [me]\u201d.\n\nWell, all of this was a little too much for my mom and one of my aunts. They texted me the next day how they didn\u2019t think it was appropriate, that there was too much detail to the story, that the guys were clearly tantalized and wanted to see pictures and didn\u2019t that concern me? I responded defensively - I said she is a free spirit, it wasn\u2019t an abnormal story to tell, and if the fam is going to picture her naked they are going to do that anyway not based on a story. \n\nSo, my mom wants me to tell my wife to tread more gently in family settings, and I don\u2019t want to get in the middle of it. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "[deleted]", "If your mom said, \"You know I'm pretty conservative, & while you two can do what you want, please try not to tell stories like that because it made me feel uncomfortable\", that would be ok.\n\nYour uncles' response was pretty creepy. Did your mom chastise them, or does she expect your wife to take responsibility for their inability to be appropriate?\n\nNTA. I think you should tell your wife because the first part is probably true. I just don't like the way your mother turned it into your wife being a temptress towards your uncles.", "NTA.", "NTA\n\nunless this is a story she tells every time she's at a family setting. Then this wouldn't be an issue of making others feel uncomfortable, but it would be very annoying", "NTA. Did your mom ask the male relatives to behave more appropriately? Seems like it was their behavior that was the problem. Your wife just answered questions honestly.", "NTA. Next time, point out that you guys are all naked under your clothes and watch the aunties freak out", "I grew up on the beach. A nude beach is really no big deal. Only gawking tourists think it is.  NTA.", "NTA. And please keep being a good husband to your wife. She's lucky to have someone like you. \n\nYour family though... Ew. They're being super creepy sexualizing her. Put the kibosh on that if you can.", "NTA. Your mother and aunt are free to clutch their pearls as the world around them changes. Their insecurities have no bearing on anyone else. Thank you for choosing to dismiss their attempts to control others.", "I'm going to go out on a limb and say NAH. If your family are conservative then convening together will involved some degree of compromise. I don't really see what's wrong with them asking for the conversation to remain in everyone's taste.\n\nThe only assholery is them locating the problem with your wife and not with the uncles being creepy but as far as \"please tread more carefully\"  is that really so bad?", "I thought so!", "Ha, you\u2019d get along with her.", "Thanks so much for this reply. The comments didn\u2019t come off as pervy - it\u2019s hard to describe, just more very curious. But I love how you put that. I don\u2019t want my wife to change!", "Thanks!", "Thanks! She\u2019s just more open than alll of them.", "Yeah I think she wants that g rating!", "Haha! Oh man.", "You have that right, honestly.", "They really didn\u2019t come off as pervy to me. My wife thought it was cute. An uncle jokingly asked about the pictures later but in a funny way.", "Second that. Greetings from Finland! And we had the best holiday in Crete where the best beaches are all nudist (although it\u2019s a bit weird when you snorkel, but well..that\u2019s nature).", "I said that! That\u2019s funny.", "It didn\u2019t sound so bad in the moment.", "This!", "Thank you! She is fun, I\u2019d never try to change her. My mom thinks she\u2019s a wild one and I think it just came out.", "But uncles dont ask us for pictures. They are the ones making it weird and are TA.", "The implication was they wanted pics of us (her obv).", "Thanks for the thoughts!", "Ha! Oh god I don\u2019t know about that.", "Yeah! It seems tame to me.", "I don\u2019t know what kind of rule this even is though!", "Thanks. The uncles were fine, my wife thought it was cute, but I get your point. My mom had it twisted.", "Yeah she\u2019s an open book! My mom doesn\u2019t always love her wild side", "Haha!", "Thanks! Makes me feel good.", "I think it's okay for your mom to ask when things are at her house for them to be closer to g-rated than not, not everybody has the same sense of humor or freedom. If this is something she's not comfortable with, I don't think there's anything wrong with Mom talking with you privately about it and asking for her preference, what you and your wife ultimately decide to do is what you decide to do, in my opinion, is it that big of a deal to rein it in a bit to respect her wishes particularly if you happen to be at her house? They might come a time when somebody does something that you're not entirely comfortable with that others might feel is fine at that point you have the right to ask for a little discretion.\n\nNAH we are all entitled to what we feel is funny, appropriate, in, etc it's what makes the world go round", "Yeah if they asked multiple times it was not a joke lol that\u2019s extremely weird to say to someone\u2019s wife especially one that\u2019s part of the family. And this uncle is also married ? You aren\u2019t the AH either way I definitely find that weird though.", "I thought it was kind of inappropriate for them to ask for photos, but your mom should be chastising them, not you or your wife.", "We HAD a nude beach at Lake Tahoe on the Nevada side. It was known to all the locals. Then outsiders. And more outsiders. Then some pearl clutches got booty-tickled and law enforcement put an end to it. I think folks still get nude there, but now have to be dumb careful since law enforcement is no longer looking the other way about it.", "I'm sure it was harmless but that's kind of an icky joke to make about a family member/someones wife lol but yeah stuff always sounds worse on paper.", "The most important is that you two are happy! Just watch out when you snorkel in a nudist beach \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udee3", "Let\u2019s start to normalise nakedness \ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude02", "And she egged it on? Yeah that\u2019s strange to me.\n\nSounds like she likes the attention. Which might be why she brought it up at all.", "Thanks, appreciate those thoughts.", "Ok thanks, I\u2019ll think on that.", "Thanks, appreciate the thoughts.", "I remember the stories about that beach!!! My family stumbled on it accidentally. My parents went all Pearl clutching yet were totally cool with me watching murder slasher horror movies.", "Yeah wish I could describe it better, but I totally get what you mean.", "Haha! My wife will love that one", "Hm, ok thanks for that, I\u2019ll think on that one.", "And I appreciate that you appreciate my thoughts. Happy New Year!", "Smh. It blows my mind the nudity is more offensive than murder slasher films.\n\nI knew a girl who's dad was a detective and mom was a jailer. They met at Secret Cove.", "Sounds to me like she was simply having fun with family.", "You too! I appreciate you for taking the time."]}
