Because we are not financially stable to give the baby the type of lifestyle we would want them to have, we decided that the best, and most responsible decision would be to abort the baby rather than making it miserable in here. \n\nTwo days ago, we started with the abortion process. It was extremely painful as I had to take too many pills, and I started bleeding a lot as well as having horrible cramps. Even though we knew it was the best thing to do for the baby, I was still feeling bad about it because I felt guilty, and deep inside I wanted to have the baby. I spent all day and night crying about the abortion, and I was way too hormonal today as well. Earlier, I was using his phone while mine was charging so I could buy some painkillers, and I saw he got a text message from his group of friends. They mentioned something about the abortion and me being disgusting for aborting the baby. \n\nI went inside of the app and read the messages, turns out my boyfriend had been sharing with them the whole abortion process without telling me or asking me for permission, and they were even making memes and jokes about it. One of the girls in the GC started saying I was irresponsible and probably a \u201cwh0re\u201d, just because I got pregnant. My boyfriend didn\u2019t say anything about that and instead just started replying with memes to her. Then he mentioned in another comment that the abortion was successful and that he would do it again. I couldn\u2019t hold it anymore and I started crying, and when he asked me what was wrong I stormed out and called him an idiot; Then I told him I had read all he said about the abortion and I wanted to know why he had shared it without asking me about it first and shared it as if that was something thrilling. His answer just was that he wouldn\u2019t talk to me because I insulted him, so AITA for calling him an idiot and telling him to never contact me again?\n\nEDIT: I tried to talk things out with him, and he started saying I was gaslighting him into making him feel awful and like the villain. He said there was nothing wrong with sharing as that was his way of coping with things and that I am immature and petty for getting upset over the way he \u201chandles his emotions\u201d.", "created_utc": 1691284318, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15jcdx5/aita_for_calling_my_bf_an_idiot_and_asking_him_to/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

From the outside looking in, it seems like he\u2019s really not the kind of person you look for in a partner. In fact, it\u2019s so far from it. Understanding the seriousness and the trauma that comes along with an abortion should be something that a decent person/ partner would do. He should be doing his best to support you during this difficult time, rather than turn you into a meme for other\u2019s entertainment. \n\nSounds like it would be best for you to drop him like a bad habit and let him torment somebody else.\n\nBe safe and I wish you the best moving forward.", " NTA. He is heinous.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry he shared something so personal to you both as a couple with a friend group. Then participated in the meme fest about it. \n\nWhen someone shows you who they are, believe them. This situation is a red flag rodeo. \n\nPlease take care of yourself. You deserve someone better than this person has shown himself to be. \n\nHugs and hope for you that you find peace and eventually someone who loves you the right way \u2014with deep trust and respect. \ud83d\udc94", "NTA. Leave him. Seek professional help to deal with the trauma of your choice. No judgment, but it is a traumatic event and needs go be unpacked and faced. I wish you the best and hope you find a better partner.", "NTA- This isn\u2019t an instance for trading memes with friends. It\u2019s especially crappy how he didn\u2019t defend you to his horrible friends.", "NTA. It's a private thing, he shouldn't have shared it without your consent. I'm so sorry this happened to you!", "NTA \u2014 he won\u2019t talk to you for insulting him? Dump him, he\u2019s immature and his friends are horrible people. Go to Planned Parenthood, talk about birth control options. When and if you\u2019re ready, you want be in control of having a baby with the right person, and not with this AH.  You made a very mature decision and I\u2019m sorry you had to go through this.", "EDIT: NTA\n\nI'm genuinely glad that you chose not to have a baby with that absolute moron. If you truly loved your partner, You'd respect them enough to not share & make memes about their medical issues/process, especially over something so private & what was supposed to be intimate. \n\nHe showed you the type of person he is early on rather than later, so let's be grateful for that! He won't be dragging you down, let alone letting others degrade you over something that everyone & their mother experiences. I'm sorry that you're going through all this on top of dealing with the abortion, it may be chaotic now, but know peace will find you!", "Oh sweetheart, I feel for you so much. Termination is a hard enough thing to go through. It took me 6 years to come to terms with mine and it robbed me of those years because I was so distraught. Your BF is disgusting and you deserve much better. Get rid of him and then work getting through this very upsetting time. Things will get better x", "Your BF is an idiot.\n\nHe never had the right to talk about the abortion to any unless he had your approval.  You were the one enduring the process, not him.\n\nHe didn't defend your choice,  He did't defend you when his friend called you a slur.  \n\nbe grateful you found out now what kid of person he really is,\n\nNTA,", "NTA. When someone shows you who they are, believe them. He just showed you what an idiot AH he is. You are better off without him. I\u2019m sorry you had to go through this to find out what he\u2019s truly like.", "Drop that immature idiot and move on.", "NTA - So the guy was informing his friends, who were making fun of you, at your most emotionally vulnerable moment? He is a horrible human being. I am sorry you had to go through that alone.", "NTA, and I\u2019m sorry you felt you had to abort the baby.  I hope you find someone who will love you and support you and your body in the future.  Many prayers your way in this difficult time.", "NTA. Keep that AH dumped in the garbage where he belongs. He deserves it after what he shared, and what he allowed to be said without defending you. I'm so sorry you had to abort a baby you wanted, but a tiny bright side is that you can be fully done with him.", "NTA \nLol thats crazy", "NTA he is absolutely disgusting for that and so are his friends", "NTA, your (hopefully ex) bf is a snivelling, spineless jerk who doesn't deserve another moment of your time. You've made a really tough choice after *both of your actions* led to this point in your life. He should be your biggest supporter right now and unfortunately, he's not. \n\n\nI want to say that I think you're wonderfully brave for making a difficult medical decision. I cannot believe the audacity of his friends calling you disgusting when this decision was made by both of you. Once the hormones level out again I'm sure you won't have a single doubt about how you've handled yourself right now. Kick him to the curb and hold out until you find a decent guy, worthy of your time and affection!", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
