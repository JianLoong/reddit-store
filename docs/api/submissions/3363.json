She asked us if she could live with us because she would rather live with family than strangers. Which is fine. Before we moved her in we set ground rules. Don\u2019t be disruptive after 9:30pm because we both wake up early for work was the main one. Now for context, Mum has been a stay at home wife/mother her entire adult life, she went from her parents to my Dad, a very traditional European family background. Dad provided everything for all us so we never wanted for anything and Mum didn\u2019t have to work. Because of this Mum became nocturnal. \n\nBack to the problem at hand. From the moment she moved in, she has made no effort to be quieter at night, she doesn\u2019t pitch in with the cleaning, not even simple menial things like emptying the inside bin to the rubbish bins outside. For example, one night I went through paper in the inside bin and the whole bag was sunk into the bin with a boxed dinner box squashed on top. I went upstairs and asked if I could talk to her. All I asked is that next time she sees the bin full could she tie up the bag and take it out instead of crushing more rubbish on top because it\u2019s messy snd hard to pull the bag back up and out. She came downstairs huffing and puffing in frustration, banged things around and opened and closed doors aggressively and loudly. I\u2019ve repeatedly asked her not to be noisy at night, so what does she do? Decides to move furniture between rooms by herself at 10pm. I\u2019ve now asked many times for her to please change her behaviour because we\u2019re not sleeping the whole night through. \n\nMy partner is now understandably cranky and tired all the time. She\u2019s been living with us since July. About a month ago we asked her to please find somewhere else to live because she isn\u2019t integrating, she\u2019s only imposing her way of life on us with no consideration for us. Today I had a very serious conversation with her about it basically saying she needs to take me seriously when I tell her these things because I\u2019m not just saying them to make her life harder, I just want peace and harmony. She only responded with \u201cokay, thank you *insert my partner\u2019s name*.\u201d As if to say I can\u2019t think for myself and that my partner sent me. \n\nAfter an hour of thinking about how that went, I sent her two links to potential share houses. One place she\u2019d love on the ground floor of a two story house with no shared spaces and the other has shared spaces but only women of her age either widowed or divorced live there, so it would be easier for her to live with strangers as she\u2019s never had to before.

You\u2019re completely right though, it\u2019s definitely behavioural. The only other person I know who\u2019s been a mother/wife and exhibited that kind of behaviour is her twin sister.", "Yeah, I know, and I get it. When we were minors if we didn\u2019t do as we were told there were serious repercussions. I have asked her and asked her not to be loud at night, we live in a townhouse so the four bedrooms and one bathroom upstairs are all very close together.

The ground floor of a two story house place that I mentioned is essentially a granny flat and I\u2019ve shown her the ad for it with all the specs and photos but she\u2019s not going for it. \n\nI would really love to help out financially, I would buy a house and put her in it if I could. I\u2019m a receptionist in an economic crisis, the best I could do is give her AUD$100 a week to help her with her expenses. Not that that would be incentive enough.", "Ok. Give her a firm deadline to leave. This is HIS home just as much as it is yours. \n\nInsist you accompany her to sign up for that single room rental unit. So she can't procrastinate it any longer.\n\nDoes she actually have enough money to support herself on her own? She may be hiding the truth of her financial situation.", "Yeah that\u2019s basically where it\u2019s at. Coz otherwise she won\u2019t do anything about it.\n\nThat\u2019s the thing, weeks after she moved in, she asked me to help her invest her \u201cnest egg\u201d. I was like \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d And she admitted she had like 30-40K in an account. Then about a month ago when I asked her to find somewhere else to live, she started crying saying she\u2019d spent all of her money and had nowhere else to go and that she would have to sleep in her car. So I can\u2019t really be sure of how much money she actually has.", "WOW! Either she's lying to manipulate you or she really is that terrible with money. How could she possibly spend THAT much, does she have expensive spending habits? If she does have any money, perhaps you should manage it, and give her an allowance. \n\nCan she get a job? Maybe as a night security guard. Or some other unskilled position. 30-40k (assuming she still has it) may not be enough to last the rest of her life. Is your father responsible for some kind of alimony?\n\nHer current plan is to be taken care of by you for the rest of her life, but she has to come to terms that this is NOT possible. Be clear and firm. I feel bad for her, from father to husband to son, she doesn't have any idea how to manage herself. Adapting to her new situation will be hard, but if she really cares about not becoming homeless, she should rise to the challenge. Maybe there are some support groups that teach basic job/life skills to adults.", "Look up the eviction requirements in your state, just so you're aware of what exactly you need to do to make it happen. Because honestly, this sounds like she will never leave until you force her", "To give you a clear understanding of my mother\u2019s spending habits: Dad closed all of the joint accounts and gave her an allowance of AUD$600/week because one time when I was 13 she spent AUD$3000 on yarn because she\u2019d decided to take up crocheting. The only way I could manage her money is if she willingly allowed me to and she found it so demoralising that Dad did that to her.\n\nShe\u2019s legally unemployable as she\u2019s never had a job in Australia. She was born here, then the family went back to Europe when she was 8, she came back when she was 25 in 1991 and six months later she was pregnant with my older sister and the rest is history.\n\nIsn\u2019t Alimony child support? They separated after we were all of age. Dad sold everything, his shares, the house and then gave her half of everything including releasing half of his retirement fund. I don\u2019t know how much more he can give her to be honest. I like it wouldn\u2019t be fair on him at this point 4 years later.\n\nShe could definitely do like skill courses and stuff we have welfare here with loads of initiatives for over 50s to learn to become self-sufficient but I don\u2019t think she wants to.", "My name and my partner\u2019s name are on the lease but Mum\u2019s isn\u2019t. She\u2019s a lodger and we have no official tenancy agreement. The only evidence that she lives here legally is that this is her residential/postal address.", "Let me get this straight: She'd prefer to be homeless than allow someone more qualified manage her money. She'd prefer to be homeless than learn any new skills. She'd prefer to be homeless than sleep at a normal hour. She'd prefer to be homeless than be a considerate roommate. She'd prefer to be homeless than take any action to improve her situation. It's not on your head when SHE makes herself homeless by being so heckin' stubborn. \n\nIt looks like Australians call it \"spousal maintenance\", she may have missed the boat on applying, but it couldn't hurt to check.\n\nCould your older sister or another sibling take her in instead?", "You've said Australian dollars. I strongly recommend you offer to accompany her to Centrelink. They have dedicated Financial Information Service Officers in most (not all) face to face offices that she could speak with about managing her money. You could help her apply for age pension (or if she's too young, a different payment). Check how long the claim would take (it tends to recommend an estimated XXX weeks) and then two weeks after that date, set as her eviction.", "Laws vary wildly about tenancy and her having mail delivered there is strong indication of residence in a lot of places. The fact that you as her landlord share common spaces with her works in your favour as this often reduces the required notice period. Just make sure you know how much notice you have to give her and how you have to deliver it eg. Some places require registered mail. And yeah you are not at all TA in this situation and your mum needs to grow up. Literally all she had to do was not bite the hand that feeds and she couldn't even manage that", "She\u2019s been taken care of since the day she was born. Rich parents back in Europe, pretty well to do husband, went from one to the other, to living in her own rental for 4 years to me, she seemed fine when she was on her own but I think she started realising the money from the divorce settlement wouldn\u2019t last forever at the rate she spends it.\n\nI\u2019m the only person who said yes to taking her in. The rest of family and friends were like \u201cnope. Hands down nope.\u201d She lived with her sister for like two months, needless to say, it didn\u2019t work out. My sisters both despise her, and she\u2019s alienated her one friend, she doesn\u2019t really have anyone. It\u2019s really sad, like I really hoped this would work out for her sake. But my partner now furiously loathes her, we\u2019re past the point of no return.", "Thank you for that insight and heads up, I\u2019ll definitely look into it \ud83e\udd1f\ud83c\udffd"]}
