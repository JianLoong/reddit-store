About ten years ago he suffered a mild stroke. Over the years since the stroke, I have noticed a difference in how he talks. His grammar seems to have reverted back to his earlier years before he began travelling all over as a professional musician. When I met him, his grammar was excellent. He used words properly, and he would never think of using words that made anyone uncomfortable. The last couple of years it has gotten worse, with some words and phrases being completely inappropriate because they are reminiscent of his childhood growing up in a state that had issues with people of color. I try to gently remind him that saying certain things will make people (our children and their families included) feel uncomfortable. He always responds with, \"well, I'm me and if no one likes me being me, too bad\". He is also much more verbal about complaining in stores (cashiers that don't pay attention to what they're doing because they're talking to the cashier or bagger next to them about getting drunk last weekend) or calling people out in parking lots or while driving. He also is good at divulging very personal things to casual friends...sometimes about me, which I find morifying. I talk to him about these things, he says I will try to do better, but it just keeps happening. \n\nNow, I realize his age and his stroke play a large part in this issue. That doesn't make it any easier. But I can't distance myself from him, he is my husband and I love him. He has always been a good man, hard-working, gifted in both music and art, friendly, kind and caring. I remind myself that these things come with age (by the way, he is 10 years older than I am and I am fully aware I might eventually be guilty of the same things) and he isn't choosing to say or do these things.\n\nSo I guess what I am saying is, don't be too hard on a 96 year old woman.
