I wish more people had the courage to call out racism, even if the woman is 96. BTW, your family thinking it's funny means they're racist too.

Just try to avoid her company", "NTA\nI give you permission to use my grandpa a a yardstick: He would be 102 now, was a miner with 8 years of school. He never used the n word once he was told that it's racist, he was the first to actively reach out to migrant workers and make them join a union and he and my grandma always welcomed my gay friends.

Racism is never ok, and we all have to learn to change with the time. You should articulate your thoughts calmly and concisely and not get angry and aggressive back, but you should say something and remove yourself from the situation. Tolerating racism makes you a racist too. My X\u2019s grandfather used to do the same things and he was suffering from dementia, and I still had a hard time holding my tongue even though he was legitimately not mentally right anymore.", "Nta. As a brown person I appreciate this", "NTA. Unfortunately I went through something similar with my late grandfather. It's not disrespectful to call someone out on their racism.

I think that if we are taking old people as seriously as any other adult and respecting them, then we should hold them to the same standards as any other adult. If we give them free pass because of their age, we are implicating that they are incapable of thinking and learning anymore.", "NTA for calling her out but she's not going to change at that age. So you are probably better off limiting contact.", "NTA. I don\u2019t care how old someone is, it doesn\u2019t give them a \u201cfree pass\u201d to be racist! She\u2019s the asshole!", "She doesn't get a pass,  you ask her to not make such comments. She may be experiencing cognitive issues if this just started.\n\nYour fam are the racists, laughing it off.

I'm afraid that your family find it funny because they think that she can say what they really want to say but know they shouldn't. Even if they want to excuse her, they shouldn't find it funny.\n\nEdit: No-one has been brave enough so far to say you are, but they've been brave enough to downvote several comments (or maybe their grandmother's did it for them).", "NTA but she\u2019s 96 and may not have all her social faculties left.\n\nI understand the upset and your wish not to be around her, but this is probably not the hill to die on with regards to the rest of your family - unless they are displaying the same behaviour.", "Nta. At that age she's likely to be bit frail (physically, emotionally) so it's important to be polite, but it's also important to stand up for what's right.

Small rural town, outlived her husband by 30+ years, and didn't drive.  She was kind and generous to everyone.  But she ended up in a nursing home.  She had a Black nurse and my grandmother adored her.  But she also referenced the nurse as the N-word.  The nurse said she didn't mind.  Maybe she didn't, maybe she was being nice.  But either way, this was a lady that no longer recognized me or my dad, so we certainly weren't going to be giving her lectures.", "If she's 93,that means she was 30 in 1960 - during the civil rights movement - she's had plenty of time to realize the error of her beliefs and improve herself. If she hasn't, then her age doesn't protect her from an AH judgment. \n\nIs this a new development? As others have said, this could be a sign of dementia. \n\nThe rest of the group laughing and thinking it's cute - definitely not okay.\n\nHow did you address it? That's important to the narrative and the judgment.", "I recognise this very much. My grandpa turned 94 this year and about a year ago he started making remarks about women and them being \u201cless evolved\u201d than men. And then keeps pushing when I disagree with him.

Why argue about it. Just tell her you disagree with her thoughts and if she wishes for you to spend time with her, you don't want to her them thoughts. \nMost people her age are racist. White people were raised they were better than black people. And black people were raised they were lass than white people so they were treated as such. I know there are exceptions to the rule but most people over 85 are racist.", "I mean, there is probably a good chance that she has seen a significant cognitive decline and is incapable of learning.", "Maybe go with a \u2018That\u2019s a different point of view\u2019 and switch to a topic he enjoys like gardening or travel\n\nThe best advice I was given was to acknowledge and re-direct. \n\nI tried a few times to put forward a different view, and after talking to the doctor it won\u2019t work and at times causes distress\n\nWhen I had it in my head, inappropriate = acknowledgment + distraction, the uncomfortable topic never continued so everyone won and we could continue quality time together", "Just because it\u2019s common, doesn\u2019t make it right.
