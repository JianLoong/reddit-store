About ten years ago he suffered a mild stroke. Over the years since the stroke, I have noticed a difference in how he talks. His grammar seems to have reverted back to his earlier years before he began travelling all over as a professional musician. When I met him, his grammar was excellent. He used words properly, and he would never think of using words that made anyone uncomfortable. The last couple of years it has gotten worse, with some words and phrases being completely inappropriate because they are reminiscent of his childhood growing up in a state that had issues with people of color. I try to gently remind him that saying certain things will make people (our children and their families included) feel uncomfortable. He always responds with, \"well, I'm me and if no one likes me being me, too bad\". He is also much more verbal about complaining in stores (cashiers that don't pay attention to what they're doing because they're talking to the cashier or bagger next to them about getting drunk last weekend) or calling people out in parking lots or while driving. He also is good at divulging very personal things to casual friends...sometimes about me, which I find morifying. I talk to him about these things, he says I will try to do better, but it just keeps happening. \n\nNow, I realize his age and his stroke play a large part in this issue. That doesn't make it any easier. But I can't distance myself from him, he is my husband and I love him. He has always been a good man, hard-working, gifted in both music and art, friendly, kind and caring. I remind myself that these things come with age (by the way, he is 10 years older than I am and I am fully aware I might eventually be guilty of the same things) and he isn't choosing to say or do these things.\n\nSo I guess what I am saying is, don't be too hard on a 96 year old woman.

The physical unpleasantness, the hopelessness that your patients will only ever get worse, and the various forms of cognitive decline.  Sure, no one wants to be insulted, but I can believe it just rolls off as one more symptom of her patient\u2019s decline", "Yeah.  I get and would expect that, but trying not to speak for others.  This lady was hands down the best nurse in that facility.", "OP hasn\u2019t given enough information apart from age whether there\u2019s a medical diagnosis- and while her comments aren\u2019t appropriate now or before, if her mind is accessing comments from her childhood, they won\u2019t always be great- but that\u2019s what she was exposed to\n\nI can see from your response you have been the recipient of racism through many stages of your life and for that I\u2019m truly sorry life has handed you that card", "Some people laugh when embarrassed or uncomfortable. Some do it to diffuse a situation.\n\nI know it\u2019s trendy to go scorched earth on everyone whose values don\u2019t align with your own, but sometimes it\u2019s best to be pragmatic.", "Being raised a certain way isn\u2019t an excuse. We all have the ability to recognize that what we were taught as children is objectionable. I agree that\u2019s it\u2019s not worth a big fight, but it\u2019s also not ok to just stand by and allow it to happen in your presence. Just because racism was common then, doesn\u2019t mean it was ok back then. It was wrong then and it\u2019s wrong now even if people don\u2019t want to see it that way. No matter how much you deny the truth, the truth goes on existing. If you want to be delusional about non-consequential things so you can sleep through the night, that\u2019s your prerogative, but if the lies you\u2019re perpetuating are harming people, then it shouldn\u2019t be tolerated.", "A 96 year old without a diagnosis of some form of dementia is capable of changing their mind, it's a bit unfair to label all old people as incapable in this way.", "No, I wouldn't lecture them. As I said in my post, you treat them with compassion. But you can still recognise it for what it is, not some bull about how it was okay in their day - it wasn't.", "It was very clear from how she spoke to the black, Irish and polish nurses I worked with. Would you like me to go into explicit detail? Because I'd rather not. And you don't know what my qualifications are. A psychologist or psychiatrist would not be the appropriate professional for that scenario, so you clearly don't know what the appropriate qualifications are here... \n\nMy care is unbiased. Me being able to identify racism doesn't change that.", "Boy comprehension is hard on the internet. I said she's 96, they are not changing her mind. I also said to confront the remark and say you don't want to hear those type of thoughts. And if they don't stop then no contact. I never said 96yo was free to say what she wants because she was raised that way, I said her mind wasn't being changed.", "I didn't say capable, I said won't.  If you spent 90 years thinking a certain way, nothing is going to convince you otherwise now.", "This isn't a post about if it is okay or about if the 96-year-old is being racist.  This is a post about confronting and upsetting a 96-year-old about something they very possibly are incapable of understanding.", "Your comment about how black vs white peoples were raised is an attempt to normalize that mindset. Your snark is unnecessary, but thanks anyway.", "That's sad, and I don't believe that's true at all. You can be stuck in your ways at any age. It's not like all 90 year olds act in the same way they did when they were 12. Whatever happened to the concept of wisdom?", "Definitely\u2026 just sad really.", "Cognitive decline to making inappropriate comments is very far removed from functioning in self care", "No need to be rude. He has been in a care home for 9 years now.", "Do you also have cognitive decline?", "Has OP said that this 96 year old has dementia? If not...", "Facts are facts where you like them or not.", "But you response accused me of downvoting you when I didn't. My reply wasn't argumentative,  we agreed to comfort them remarks and say if it doesn't change then less/no contact. I just said trying to change her mind at 96yo is a waste of time.", "I\u2019m 41 and all good, cheers", "No.  But it is a nuanced answer that requires a lot more information.  If it is a 96-year-old that that has all their cognitive abilities and functions on their own, NTA.  If is a 96-year old that requires 24/7 care and OP strolls in once a month and starts lecturing everyone, then it is a YTA.  If is somewhere in between, which it likely is, then it is more nuanced.\n\nAnd I started by saying I'm torn.  I didn't say YTA.  I said I was torn.", "Ironic if you to be talking about comprehension as that\u2019s basically what I just said. Racism was wrong then and it\u2019s wrong now, and normalizing the idea that\u2019s it\u2019s fine to be racist past a certain age because it was \u201cnormal\u201d then, is not ok. It wasn\u2019t ok then\u2026 it was common\u2026 they\u2019re not the same.", "My comment was to \"NoseThese604\". Not sure how it got directed to you....", "Once again I didnt say it's fine to be racist as a old person, just saying most are.", "Once again, you said it in a way that normalizes it. It\u2019s not normal.", "But it was normal. The world is progressing we still need a lot of work but during these older people's life racism was very normal."]}
