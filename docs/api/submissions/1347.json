{"id": 1347, "submission_id": "ym7cqb", "title": "AITA for expecting my husband to pay me back?", "selftext": "My husband (30M) and I (28F) have always had shared finances. We dated for 5 years prior to marriage and talked extensively in premarital counseling about how we would handle finances to avoid future conflicts and decided two things: we would have shared bank accounts and we set a spending limit of $500 before consulting the other partner to agree to the purchase.\n\nA couple of years ago, he needed to go back to school to get a raise at work and improve his job security in the long-term. The program was supposed to be 18 months for $15k. I had a college fund that was given to me by my parents. I offered to pay for the entire $15k out of my college fund so we could avoid adding more student loans to our household.\n\nAfter over 2 years, he is only 1/3 of the way through the Master's degree. At this point, I\u2019ve already exhausted my college fund and we are now on a monthly payment plan of almost $1k per month. He signed up for the payment plan without consulting me because he knew I\u2019d never agree, so I was already upset that he broke one of our rules for finances. I make twice as much money as he does, so I pay for the majority of the household expenses plus all of his tuition payments. I know that some couples who split finances pay for things according to their salary contribution to the household budget. So I decided to run the numbers and see how much we were individually making and spending. I realized that after I pay for 66% of the household expenses, I should have $2k of my own \u201cfun money\u201d leftover each month. I also realized that once he pays for 33% of bills, he only has $300 leftover each month. He spends a lot more than that on gas for his truck, going out with friends, video games, etc. It didn\u2019t seem fair to me that the $1k per month for his degree is paid for entirely by me.\n\nHe is taking forever to finish his degree because he says \u201che doesn\u2019t have time after working hard all day\u201d. That doesn\u2019t make sense to me, though, because I have spent months working 12-hour shifts at the hospital and studying for my board exams while he\u2019s usually playing video games for 3-4 hours each night. So I told him I was done paying for his school. He said he would just quit the degree program. I said that was fine, but I would expect to be paid back the $15k+ that I have already spent on it since it didn\u2019t end in him getting his degree and increasing his salary contribution to the household income like it was supposed to. I said I don\u2019t care if I have to take his $300/month until I get my $15k back, no matter how long it takes. That means no money for video games, shoes, or going out with friends. I want to limit how much he spends from our joint checking account and put the extra $300/month into a college fund for our son. My college fund was originally going to be given to our son before I spent in on my husband\u2019s degree, so it makes sense to me to put the money back where it belongs. He thinks this is me withholding what should be shared money and it\u2019s unfair.

He doesn't have the \"time\" to finish the program? Is he serious? He wanted to get his Masters. Its his responsibility now. \n\nThis is some really weird behavior. I don't want to give you AH status, but maybe it wasnt the best idea to agree to give him your son's college fund. It sounds like it went to waste.", "NTA. \u201che signed me up because he knew i wouldn\u2019t agree\u201d = RED FLAG", "NTA, my wife and I have 100% shared finances and we are 32 years old. I would be heartbroken and upset if she did to me what your husband is doing. He's not respecting you, your income, your savings, your wants for the future, or anything related to your family unit. He's just being userous. \n\nFrom reading your post here it really sounds like this situation could be a dealbreaker for you if he doesn't agree to fund your childs education and make some changes. I'd tell him that flat out. Husband has already broken your trust and confidence - if he's playing 4 hours of video games per day I'm going to wager he's not the most attentive father either?\n\nIt sounds like you two could use some counseling sooner rather than later. This is a trajectory for divorce", "NTA. He signed up for 1k a month without consulting you, which is against your agreement. He needs to accept responsibility and make it right.", "Wow - your husband dosen't care about your money, where is came from, or what is was supposed to be for. Your parents gave you money for *your* education, not his. Giving it to him (yes, paying for him is *giving away money*, you're probably not going to see it again) was you being incredibly generous, 15k is a lot of money! Him not wanting to pay it back is honestly just selfish, especially as he didn't finish it.\n\nNTA in any way - your husband is.", "NTA. I'm going to suggest marriage counseling and financial counseling.\n\nIt sounds like he's taking you for granted and not being responsible with his finances.", "NTA. Your husband is, though. \n\nGiving your husband your entire college fund is a huge deal and he doesn\u2019t seem to respect that at all. Not to mention he blatantly broke your agreement because he knew you wouldn\u2019t be okay with what he was doing. He doesn\u2019t get to pick and choose when he wants to work as a team with you - he\u2019s either all in or he\u2019s not. \n\nAlso, that excuse of not having the time to finish the degree is just bs. My husband works full time and is working on completing his masters degree as well. It\u2019s really hard work and very time consuming, but he\u2019s getting it done. He works all day and comes home to do school work. He spends his weekends doing school work. It can be done - your husband just isn\u2019t committed to getting it done. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. Unfortunately, this is a serious issue in your marriage that can\u2019t be ignored or easily fixed. I\u2019d suggest marriage counseling and/or financial counseling moving forward.", "Mostly NTA - but how on earth has he taken 2 years to get a third of the way through an 18 month degree, and you only just noticed?\n\nIt sounds to me as though he's not really \"too tired\", but that the degree was more difficult than he was expecting, and he can't do it.", "I feel bad for you. Your hubby has stolen your college fund $ (by deception) and won\u2019t pay it back, and destroyed your trust. He has pretty much ruined your marriage. NTA, but you need to face reality.", "NTA\n\n\nHe didn't keep his end of the agreement and complete the program in 18 months. And he violated your other agreement about expenses over $500. He's broken your trust TWICE. He needs to be accountable.", "Sounds like yall need to go back to financial counseling because wow was that a waste of funds. He should be paying that back into a college fund since he wasted it. NTA", "NTA. Tell him he's paying back into the shared account.", "NTA he's taking advantage of you and dragging things along for whatever reason. There's NO reason you should be carrying the weight of his loans like that, especially since you didn't agree to them - he did.", "OP - NTA. But your hubby is totally an asshole here. I really hope hubby is a amazing person otherwise, because from what I'm reading, he's really not much of a partner at all.  Lets see, he works full time, gets home, plays video games for 4 hours, pretends to study for his degree, and goes out and hangs with friends. There doesn't seem to be much time for anything else. What about spending time with you and your son?", "NTA. Isn't there a time limit to complete grad degrees? Are you sure he goes at all?\n\nYou should only combine finances when you have similar values and goals. This does not seem to be the case. The differences may be enough that maintaining a relationship will be difficult without counseling.", "Nta and I\u2019d start saving my fun money in a separate account.", "NTA.\n\nHe\u2019s wasting money that was meant for your son\u2019s education. How is he not shamed by that?\n\nYou guys had a agreement. He didn\u2019t respect it. He doesn\u2019t get to bail out of it by using emotional manipulation.", "He\u2019s the asshole and a user", "NTA and honestly, document all of this carefully because I have a hard time seeing this relationship not ending in divorce. At the very least, you two need to go back to marriage counseling since he so blatantly violated one of the agreements you made prior to your marriage.", "NTA. He needs to suck it up and finish the degree. Yes, it may be hard & tiring, but it is only for 12 more months. In addition to the extra costs to get the degree, you also have to add in the cost of the extra money he isn't receiving at his job. If he had just pushed forward for the initial 18 months he'd be done. \n\nWould he be receptive to sitting down and figuring out the actual cost of his degree? So not only, the actual cost of taking the classes, but how much money he has not gotten due to not having the degree. So the initial $15,000 but then the extra costs until the degree is finished, plus the cost of not getting the raise he is anticipating. So, for example, if the raise would be $10,000, he has already lost $5,000 that he could have gotten for the past 6 months, plus an additional $10,000 for each year it takes him to finish. At the rate he is going, it will take him another 4 years, so an additional $40,000 minimum that he will not be receiving. If the raise would have been more than that (likely) then multiply that $40,000 by what he would have gotten.", "INFO is he failing these classes? I'm confused how he's only 1/3 of the way through but has still spent more money than planned", "NTA. It's him that's being the AH. It's just sad how irresponsible your husband is.\n\nIts not surprising he doesn't earn as much as you... He just doesn't spend time working", "NTA but you might want to rethink the whole 'shared finances' approach.", "NTA. He needs to find a better paying job or get used to having no \u201cmad money\u201d. He probably would have taken school a lot more seriously if he had taken out loans to pay for it,", "NTA he isn\u2019t being fair to you at all", "NTA\nHis behavior is odd. Does he not want the degree? Does he not remember all that work the two of you put into working this out so that this exact type of situation would be avoided?", "ESH. He's wronger, no doubt, but you're pushing in an unproductive direction. Understandable, but making it worse just to prove a point won't help.\n\nYou offered to pay 15k for college. You did that. Unless there was some agreement in place at the time about how if he didn't get a raise or if he didn't finish the course then he had to pay that back, then insisting on repaying it now - knowing it is going to be a struggle with him having literally no money for over 4 years - is unreasonable. He is never going to agree to that, no one would, so you're setting an ultimatum knowing it's forcing him to do what you want. Especially when you're also saying you won't pay for him to continue, which he can't afford alone, so he has no valid option: he cannot pay to keep it up, and he cannot agree to go without any money for years. \n\nNow, he has obviously been causing a problem for a significant period, and he does have to do something to fix it. He committed to a course on the assumption of long term gain, but hasn't followed through, increasing the cost and delaying the payoff. If this had been unavoidable - an illness or bereavement or something that interrupted his study, say - that would be a \"life happens\" thing. But it's not, it's him not putting the hours in. Maybe it's tougher than he thought, but he hasn't only learned that this week, so he should have talked to you before now and tried to re-evaluate if it's worth continuing before sinking yet more money and time in. Pouting and threatening to quit when pushed is defensive and childish, and he needs to get over that. \n\nHe needs to work out what his new timeline is: how long does he expect it to take and how much time does he need per day/week to meet that goal. Then, together, you can work out how much that will cost, and if it's worth it to avoid writing off all you've spent to date. Then either he does give it up, as a mutual agreed decision, even though it's a gut-punch to write off that much, or you work out how much you both can contribute to get the rest of it done and he commits to a set 'homework' schedule to make sure he doesn't fall behind again. Ideally, that's what you want, so your investment doesn't get wasted and he can start contributing more and/or helping contribute to son's college fund once he has an increased wage.", "ESH\n\nI know you were trying to do the right thing by paying for his schooling, but are you telling me that his job does not have any type of tuition reimbursement, especially since this was needed for a promotion? I find that odd.\n\nAlso, it seems that if it were HIS 15k he might be losing, he may have been more motivated to complete these assignments on time, or at least pulled the plug more quickly if he found he just could not handle the material.\n\nYou have every right to be angry, and want that money back for your child. I just wish you would have told him that was part of the agreement when you gave him the money for his masters.", "Yup YTA. That\u2019s not how marital finances work. You threatening to take every dime of his available money because you are upset you made a choice that you regret could quite honestly be labeled financial abuse. You don\u2019t get to decide he has to give you all his available money. And you don\u2019t get to turn it into a loan after the fact. That\u2019s not how that works either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Each course has deadlines for the assignments, he just never turns them in on time.", "This is one of those \u201cgo at your own pace\u201d programs. So he just takes forever to turn in his assignments. He gets good grades on the ones he turns in, he just doesn\u2019t turn them in very often. He\u2019ll spend two months working on just one paper.", "We sat down and had a discussion after the first 6 months of the program when I realized he was making poor progress. He set an alarm on his phone and marked a set time on his calendar to do his homework every day. He would stick to the schedule for a week or two, then forget about it again and just snooze through the alarms. After 6 more months of this, he had his school advisor start calling him at an agreed-upon time each night to remind him to do his homework. He stopped taking her calls after a while. Believe me, we have had many discussions and tried many ways to resolve this situation before it got this bad. This is not my hill to die on, however, so I am prepared to cut my losses, I just hate to think about how selfish and pointless this investment was when we have a child to think about. And I guess I just want my husband to experience some serious consequence as a result of his actions because I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll ever really appreciate how unfair the situation he put our family in is. He drives his dream car, which is a much nicer, newer, and expensive car than mine. He works at his dream job. We live in his dream neighborhood because it\u2019s close to his work. I do not work my dream job. I do not drive my dream car. I like my job, but it\u2019s not my dream job. To work my dream job, I would have to take a significant pay cut. When my husband and I agreed to move to the dream neighborhood, it was with the agreement that he would finish his degree to make more money so we could maintain the high cost of living here without me having to provide so much of the financial support. So I guess I\u2019m upset because so much was dependent on him getting this degree and he made so many promises. Now I\u2019m in over my head paying for this big house and his fancy car, and I don\u2019t have any hope in sight for things to change.", "Thissssss!

His raise is contingent on getting the degree. The longer it takes him to complete the degree the longer until he gets the raise. Add amount of money the raise would earn him of several years and it could amount to a substantial amount of money that he and family could have benefited from.", "If that is the case, then he would be doing his assignments and studying instead of play 3-4 hours of video games.
