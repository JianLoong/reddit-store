Aside from my sister who was always academically inclined but never enjoyed learning so she didn\u2019t do as well as my brothers and I.\n\nNow for the actual story, I am extremely close to my nephew and he and I spend a lot of time together. I\u2019ve noticed he\u2019s incredibly smart (like was talking in full sentences and could carry a conversation before he turned 2) now he\u2019s almost three and he knows all his ABCs can count well over 20 and understands basic addition and subtraction. He\u2019s also around the age that my mom started teaching me how to read so I\u2019ve been going over the basics of what sounds the letters make and what not. Here\u2019s the issue my sister(his mom) recently noticed that I\u2019ve been teaching him stuff and got really weird about it. She claims that he doesn\u2019t understand what I\u2019m trying to teach him and I\u2019m just going to confuse him, she also doesn\u2019t believe dinosaurs ever existed so she isn\u2019t letting me teach him about dinosaurs or watch pbs dino documentaries with him. Keep in mind by this point he knows the sounds that half of the letters of the alphabet make and he\u2019s started to put different sounds together on his own (like kid you not this child is S M A R T). Not to mention he loves learning and every time I sit down with him and start teaching him about things he lights up like this kid is never happier than when he\u2019s learning something new. This is where I could be wrong, today I was teaching him about tyrannosaurs cause they\u2019re his favorite dinosaurs. I was explaining to him that there were multiple species of tyrannosaurs (I just told him there were different kinds) and they were all different sizes and lived all over the world. My sister came in and immediately started nitpicking and told me she doesn\u2019t want him learning about dinosaurs because they\u2019re \u201cnot real\u201d. That was the final straw for me and I snapped and told her I\u2019m not gonna let my nephew grow up to be a country bumpkin just because that\u2019s the personality shes prescribed to him. My parents are trying to stay out of it, all we\u2019ve heard from them is that she\u2019s being nit picky and rude and I\u2019m being unreasonable. So am I the asshole for teaching my nephew?\n\nEdit: I was told to add this information my sister is a fundamentalist Christian. She\u2019s caught up in the Q Anon sphere and doesn\u2019t go to church she listens to fundamentalist podcasts. She genuinely believes it\u2019s her job to shape her child and make sure he grows up in her religion. I have no problem with her raising my nephew as a Christian cause I know he\u2019s going to realize that those beliefs make no sense, I\u2019m just providing context.", "created_utc": 1668902991, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzq4mg/aita_my_sister_is_not_letting_me_teach_my_nephew/", "score": 373, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He's obviously a very smart boy and learning is fun for him. You'd never get a kid that age to sit still long enough otherwise.

They just pretend that they co existed with humans. \n\nThe thing is....this kid is going to be messed up by his parents. Thats kind of inevitable at this point. IMO the best thing you can do for him is to stay in his life. Don't make the sister so mad that she cuts you out. The kid will KNOW that mom is out of touch. And you need to still be in his life so that he can reach out to you for the truth when he's older. \n\nSo keep teaching him. Just teach him about like dolphins and trees and insects. \n\nAnd if he asks you something that sister will flip out over, just say something like \"we can talk about that when youre old enough to go to college\" or something like that.

When youre older, we can go to the library together and you can pick any books you want to read\"", "If this kid is as smart as you say he is, he'll figure out his mom is a nut job soon enough and reach out for your help. Be there for him when he does.", "NTA  I don't see anything wrong with what you are doing. Some of the people commenting obviously don't have school aged children. I have 3 kids in elementary school and when your child starts Kindergarten they expect your child to know how to count and recognize numbers 1-25, They expect your child to know their ABCs and how to write them, they expect you child to know how to wire thier own name and they expect your child to be able to read at least 25 basic sight words. I have a almost 2 yr old as well and he knows about half of his ABCs and can count to 8. Parents have a responsibility to teach their children the basics at home so they are prepared to start school or else they are going to be behind from the beginning of their academic schooling. If their parents aren't stepping up to the plate and teaching their child the basic things that most toddlers around the same age are also learning then someone else needs to for the child's sake. They only thing I only slightly disagree with is the teaching your nephew about dinosaurs. I know they are real and it's kind of ridiculous that your sister doesn't want him learning about them even though he will eventually learn about them later in school maybe just stick to the ABCs and counting and letter sounds once they get the letter sounds start testing their reading skills with small 2 and 3 letter words. My current kindergartener has been reading since he was 3 and a half. His teacher is very impressed with his reading level and comprehension so your nephew may also start reading at a young age and there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.", "NTA.

If she was beating the kid bc she thought of that as a fit punishment, would the comments stay the same? Oh they wouldnt bc shes harming the kid?

If a child is \u2018an early reader\u2019 because he was taught that early on, what it means is that will be an \u2018early reader\u2019. That\u2019s it! It will have zero impact on his academic future. At his age he learns through play and his social and emotional development need to come first and foremost. Please just take him to the park, group activities where he can socialize with peers and not just family, play games that require imagination only or give him\nToys that require the same. This is when people/children have to learn this stuff. Academics can be taught later, this stuff can not and he won\u2019t be academically hurt in anyway shape or form by not doing it early. Forcing academic stuff on him when he should be out playing in the dirt isn\u2019t helping him become a well rounded and successful individual and since his mom is nuts he\u2019s going to need critical thinking skills and independent thought more than ever. Good luck.", "NTA\nReading the comments, your sister is bat shit crazy and will harm her child with her upbringing. What did she do on the 6th of January 2021? Maybe there\u2019s an easy way to solve this problem\u2026", "Honestly I have to go with NTA here. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re teaching him about magic and voodoo and whatnot that I\u2019m sure his mother would be absolutely against. You are teaching things he is going to learn regardless in school that is essential for him to function in society. Also what kid doesn\u2019t like dinosaurs?! Nor are you forcing him to do this; from what you\u2019ve said in your replies he actively wants and enjoys it. \n\nIf (hypothetically) you are a mechanic and your nephew asked you how cars worked and he was eager to learn more about it, would his mother be against that? Because if not then the only reason people are saying Y T A is because he\u2019s asking about something that his mother\u2019s religion can\u2019t answer and you are giving him a widely accepted explanation for it. And really what\u2019s the harm? If the kids as smart as you say he is, he\u2019s probably gonna realize eventually that his mother\u2019s religion is a bunch of hooey.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t think talking to him about dinosaurs is a horrible thing.

If you had a child. Would it be okay for your sister to teach your that child that dinosaurs aren\u2019t real and Jeebus is the way? If she thought her beliefs were better than yours.

I get it, it\u2019s frustrating when you see parents so stupid it hurts your head but not your kid, not your business.

But you really do have to respect other people's children and how they are choosing to raise them. You have to let them trust you or they won't feel comfortable with you spending time with the kid. You knew she didn't want him learning about evolution but you chose to teach him that- that a big breach in trust. I would hate my niblings to be brought up by religion and a dumb one at that, but I'm afraid it's not your choice. Be in it for the long game. Let him learn by watching you as he gets older, let him see how different people are out there. But not yet, not while he's tiny.

My best suggestion would be to toe the line with your sister while still finding subjects your sister deems \u201cappropriate\u201d you can discuss & learn with him, so that you may remain close with your nephew.

Hopefully you both can have an adult discussion and reach a compromise of some sort.\n\nAs for your sister, she does seem to be nitpicky. While it's entirely her choice as a parent on how to raise her child, she should be able to have an adult conversation with you on this, instead of giving random excuses to deflect. \n\nYou both probably need to just communicate better, and respect your boundaries.

Right now the lid has op to give him some guidance, and help once he grows up and needs it, if op is not in the kids life he won't have that.\n\nIf anything the actuall reason why we have polio and small pox comming back is because of people like you and op, people would be such science deniers if science believer weren't so fucking patronising and snobbish.\n\nEdit to fix some mistakes - might've missed a few tho, English is my third language", "Interests don't shift so drastically for no reason. You enjoyed it your sister clearly didn't. \n\nLook we don't know each other, you don't have to agree with my opinion or even take into consideration. You should however consider what's more important to you, rubbing it in your sisters face that you think you're smarter than her or remaining in your nefew's life and give him support that he'll most likely need growing up", "Being fundie Christian isn't a crime, and OPs sister's views, while not shared by many, aren't a crime either. Fundies don't believe in evolution and dinos. \n\n>That\u2019s stupid to give all the authority to the parents for everything,\n\nThat's what being a parent is. You are the authority over your kid unless it can be proven that you aren't capable. Being a fundie Christian doesn't make you a legally irresponsible parent.\n\nI can appreciate OPs desire to help, but she will need to respect her sister's boundaries and wishes because it's *her* kid, not OPs. All she can do is be there for her nephew if/when needed.", "She's a disgrace for a human being, let alone intelligence.", "Hahahaha my sister didn\u2019t burn out at the age of five and it wasn\u2019t a sudden shift she got into showing rabbits and riding horses and she started to lose interest in academics right around then she\u2019s not dumb and she knows that she also knows I don\u2019t think she\u2019s dumb, I can see where I should have added some clarity about the timelines there", "Now that\u2019s a good one I don\u2019t hate my sister but it\u2019s cute that you tried to put that on me do I despise her beliefs yes she\u2019s subscribed to a far more extreme and harmful version of the Christianity that traumatized me of course I despise that belief system and I despise the people who dragged her into it is that a problem? Is it really wrong to hate the people and ideas that made my sister a racist and a homophobe? I think not keep in mind by this point you\u2019re in the minority, because most people agree that lying to children and attempting to indoctrinate them is wrong.", "My fundamentalist aunt and uncle did this to their poor children. They had 8 of them and not a goddamn one of them turned into anything useful when they became adults.", "I guess you may have to strike a balance between teaching him stuff and teaching him stuff that she will get very riled up about such as the dinosaur issue. This isn't an ideal solution but if you rock the boat too much, she could very well cut you off from him.\n\nIt's great that you are encouraging learning and your sister sounds unreasonable but it may be best to take a strategic approach. Maybe take him to some fun activities which involve learning and sneak learning into everyday situations.\n\nFor example, if you take him to an ice cream parlour, use it as an opportunity to teach him money maths. Get him to help you count things and read some signs and labels and read books with him.", "That\u2019s true.", "And you\u2019re saying that you\u2019d walk away from your nephew and no longer be a mollifying voice in his upbringing. So yes, most people here, including myself, are against indoctrinating children like your sister is doing. But getting people to agree with you and pat you on the back does nothing for your nephew. Seems you don\u2019t want to put the hard work in", "To quote Nick Fury.  \nI recognise the council has made a decision, but given that it's a stupid-ass decision, I've elected to ignore it.\u00a0", "Not sure why you\u2019re getting downvoted. I agree that it\u2019s pretty likely that if OP continues this trend without any compromises with the mom, mom will cut OP off and OP won\u2019t be able to interact with nephew at all anymore. Which would be sad in this case for several reasons.", "I do understand your point, but this child is not at school age (nursery is possible) and is therefore unlikely to be at the level of learning that needs formalised teaching methods. \nEven if they did, it is far better that they receive some education from OP than none from their fundamentalist mother (imo).", "Yeah I said that as an empty threat she can\u2019t afford childcare I\u2019m her only option and it\u2019s going to be like that for a long time."]}
