I noticed him immediately in the cereal isle and avoided it in hopes he would leave me alone.\n\nFor context, in highschool he used to bully me. I was often a victim of verbal abuse through him and his friends. One of their favorite things to do would be to call me names referring to my mom's schizophrenia, often also calling me an orphan (nothing wrong with it but it still hurt). I was (and still am) overweight in highschool, they'd also take my work from me and rip it up (this included artwork). Later on through highschool I figured out I was trans, I ended up confiding in another individual we'll call Evie. Evie had been dating my bully (Whom we'll call mark) and told him after she let slip that i had a big revelation. Things got much worse after that, he almost had to be expelled (I won't go into detail), and in short a physical altercation took place. \n\nNeedless to say, after highschool never seeing him again was ideal. \n\nI saw him yesterday as I was shopping after work, he had seen me walk away and followed me (ignoring the large noise cancelling headphones on my head.)\n\nI could tell he saw me and hoped that by ignoring him he'd leave me alone.

Why hate?\n\nMe: You mean the things YOU did? After all you put me through you expect me to play nice? I'd rather do taxes five times every day than be around you.

It became so normal for me that I started telling myself the same thing thinking I look fat and ugly. \n\nI decided to be the better person when I last met one of my worst bullies on the street by chance after years of not meeting them. I was talking nicely to him and his gf when he suddenly jabbed me again with a comment about how ugly i used to look because i was too tanned (i'm asian and generally darker than my peers, but definitely not anything out of the ordinary). I decided it is just not worth subjecting myself to that again and unfriended/unfollowed all of them at once. \n\nI wish I could tell him and my other bullies what you said to yours. Therapy can only help so much and the damage has been done. I'm glad you stood up for yourself and you should be proud you did. \n\nJust a note, making fun of someone's mental disorder will never be okay, even worse if they're making fun of your mother. Don't feel bad about yourself"]}
