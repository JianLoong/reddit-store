When I said it was delicious she got all smug about how she had gotten me to eat cottage cheese.

He talks about cheese and hating all cheese and I pipe up \"except in pesto\" not malicious like, and he just looks at me funny, doesn't get mad or anything but asks if there is chees in it. I say \"yes in pesto there is cheese. in most regulars there is parmesan.\"\nHe just smiled and changed the topic but since then has asked the pasta salad to be without the pesto he liked so much. I even started only buying cheeseless pesto the last two years (wasn't really a thing here before) and he still won't eat it.\n\n\nIt is definitely a mental aversion. \n\nHowever, I never maliciously gave him cheese and then put it as a \"gotcha moment\" but it still happened.\n\nHubby still eats all the other stuff I make though because he trusts me not to do it on purpose.", "OP said they don't like cottage cheese. The Cousin obviously knew about it otherwise she wouldn't have rubbed it in their face afterwards.", "Same. I told my mom that lavender rice makes me sick and she didn\u2019t believe me. She gave me half normal rice mixed with lavender rice and after a couple of bites, I threw up all over her nice rug. She had already tried that with me with beets as well and I had the same exact reaction: I threw up everywhere. Why she thought it would be a good idea to do it a second time and then yell at me for feeling sick is one of the reasons I went NC.", "Literally wanted to comment E S H simply because I\u2019ve never ever heard of lasagna (at least the traditional Lasagna Bolgnese, which is what is usually understood as simply lasagna outside Italy) being made with ricotta or cottage cheese or in fact anything other than bechamel.", "As long as I like the taste of the end-product and it\u2019s nothing I\u2019m allergic to.\n\nI hate Bleu cheese, absolutely would not touch it - looks horrible and the thought of eating mould is disgusting\u2026.but I still love four cheese pasta because I understand that the bleu cheese gives it abit of\u2026nuttiness and funk that elevates the dish and I wouldn\u2019t go without it.\n\nPeople that won\u2019t eat a dish because it contains XXXX but can\u2019t taste it without being told that XXXXX is in the dish are just insufferable", "People have done this to me. My reaction, every time, was \u201cwow, impressive. I couldn\u2019t even tell.\u201d Hiding stuff I didn\u2019t like into dishes actually helped me get used to them over time and overcome my picky eating.\n\nPersonally, I see it as a risk for the cook to take if they are confident enough in their cooking. If you hide an ingredient I don\u2019t like in a dish, and I can tell it\u2019s there and as a result don\u2019t like the dish, I\u2019m going to be mad at you. You made me a dish you knew, or ar least could reasonably have predicted, I wouldn\u2019t like, and now I\u2019m hungry and don\u2019t have anything to eat. But if you pull it off and I liked the dish, I will honestly tell you I liked the dish. I will even encourage you to make the dish again. I\u2019m not gonna sulk and whine about it \u201con principle.\u201d It\u2019s just not that serious.", "A sensible person would say \"Honestly I couldn't tell the difference. It's only raw/pure that I don't like this food\" if you were gleeful about it I'd think you were a bore, but I wouldn't turn it into a huge drama and act like it was the biggest betrayal since Brutus stabbed Julius Caesar.", "Allergic to dairy? How is this one of the top comments?\nDo you know what lasanga is? Do you know what ricotta is? Do you have any idea how much dairy goes into a lasagna? If op had a dairy allergy she shouldn't be eating lasanga at all, which clearly isn't the case as op eats ricotta.", "I wish I could downvote this more than once. You clearly have no reading comprehension. It was a cheese for a cheese, and not even a switch of animal. Ricotta and cottage cheese are basically the same.\nOP is YTA", "No the point is that you're making a false equivalency", "If she was allergic to dairy, she would probably not have eaten lasagna in the first place.  That said, OP has a right to eat or not eat what she wants without being ambushed or embarrassed.", ">What if she had been allergic to dairy and had a serious reaction?\n\nWhat? So cottage cheese is dairy, but ricotta cheese isn't?\n\n>I said \"what if she had been\". \n\nThen she shouldn't be eating lasagna...which has dairy in it unless someone specifically makes dairy-free lasagna.", "Well thank God Ricotta is lactose free. Oh wait", "What if she had been allergic? Then this most likely wouldn\u2019t have happened. She knew for fact she just didn\u2019t like it and wasn\u2019t allergic. There is a world of difference between incorporating an ingredient someone doesn\u2019t like into a dish without telling them and *deliberately fucking poisoning someone.* Doing the former doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll do the latter. That\u2019s like arguing jaywalking is a slippery slope to burglary.", "Last week it was replacing Ricotta for Cottage Cheese, this week it might be replacing Garlic for Polonium. Better safe than sorry.", "You need to fucking chill. Just because they switch out one dairy for another, doesn't mean they would willingly poison someone who is allergic to something. That's one hell of a disgusting assumption, and says a lot about how you think.", "This was exactly what I was thinking", "Yes! Heck, even with specific soft cheeses like ricotta,  I can quickly tell if it's something I like or not, even without a label. Philadelphia or Temp Tee cream cheese is great, while Walmart brand is too sour. Breakstones sour cream is amazing,  other brands tend to be gritty or weirdly sour in a way that sour cream shouldn't be. I love smooth ricotta like Galbani, usually cannot stand the chunkier versions like Pollyo", "I often don\u2019t tell my husband what\u2019s in something until he tries it because his mind messes with him and makes shit up for his palate. For example, he insisted rice-a-roni was spicy because of the \u2018red noodles\u2019 in it. He saw me cook it once and realized those \u2018red noodle\u2019 were literally just more browned at the start than the others and weren\u2019t spicy.\n\nHis mom brags about not using salt in her cooking and has very inconsistent food intolerances that don\u2019t give her attacks when she doesn\u2019t realize a \u2018trigger food\u2019 is in it. We don\u2019t trick her, she just doesn\u2019t ask and serves herself before we realize it. Like severe gluten intolerance but she\u2019s had rice pilaf with no issues.\n\nI like to think Im stopping the cycle by expanding his eating this way.", "My results with the \"please try it\" method are mixed at best. Sometimes, it's the fact that they know it's there, so they claim that they notice it when I know for a fact they can't. I would never put something in, then rub it in someone's face, though. But sometimes, there's a mental aspect to picky eaters that any prior knowledge would ruin. It's a weird area to navigate because I know picky eaters who have eaten a certain food for years before finding out it has something they don't like and then immediately stopped eating it. Like at some point you have to acknowledge that there's a larger issue at play", "That's why cannibals call human flesh \"long pork\".", "that\u2019s\u2026 not how it works for most people. and even if it does, it\u2019s still not the way you should go about it.\n\nwhen I was like 11 my grandma gave me a piece of fruit and said it was apple then asked if I liked it. I said it was just okay, to which she got all smug, \u201csee you say you don\u2019t like pears, it was a pear, i tricked you into eating a pear!\u201d \n\nI don\u2019t like pears much and I still don\u2019t eat them, all it did was show me I need to be careful and to this day if I decide someone sounds even a little sus about listing ingredients I refuse to eat it because I get stressed. \n\nironically, I would be more open to try something when people are being honest than when I feel paranoid because everyone around me claims they know what I like better than me.", "Well, then you're wrong. It happens.", "Ooo that's smart", "That's a fair concern, but in this case it evidently did not make OP ill, since she couldn't tell the difference.", "But thats the thing--- it's not up you to decide he eats onions. \n\nHow come you get to choose if he eats onions? How come he doesn't get that choice?", "The cottage cheese, much like the Iranian yogurt, is not the issue.", "Yeah, but that\u2019s not exactly the same because parents do it out of the genuine wish to feed them healthy food. Not to maliciously get one over them and then rub it in their faces in front of others to embarrass them.\n\nMy own mum once cooked a meal with pork in it for her Muslim husband and was super smug about how much he liked it.

It\u2019s not like OP is being extremely picky. They are allowed to not like cottage cheese (which, I hate too, and have to find lasagna without it and I\u2019m okay with that) and the moment you lie to us about what is in our food will make us never trust you.

If someone hates a particular food, I will never force them to eat it by hiding it from them. Also, what makes u think OP has never tried cottage cheese before and decided they hate it?"]}
