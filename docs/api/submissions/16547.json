As harsh as it sounds, it's past time that your daughter learned to look to herself and her spouse to provide for her children.  Seems she has a history of letting others take care of her business.  You are at a point in life where you need to make sure you have the resources to provide for your retirement and your adopted grandson's future.  Some people are not happy no matter what you do for them; in other words, it's never enough.  That's how your daughter sounds to me.  It's right for you to stand up to protect yourself and your future liabilities.  While I feel that your daughter has a special needs child to care for, she and her spouse need to understand that is their responsibility, not yours, to figure out.  You are not an ATM.  Sounds like she's had recent opportunities to manage extra monies but chose to assign those fund elsewhere.

She will likely not be able to afford services that could make a significant difference in this child's life. \n\nWhen children receive assistive services early in life, it can make an incredible difference in the future choices available to them. I understand not funding his entire future schooling. However, if you are willing and able to give him access to any help even if not as big a thing as tuition, it could help him so much. Perhaps if you see something that would be of high value to him, maybe offer to pay for just that and pay the service provider directly?\n\nYou would not be an A H for using your money however you see fit.
