Your perspective is a handful of dates years ago makes him persona non grata to anything in her life at the official moment of your lives being joined, and presumably moving forward. \n\nThere is no where for this relationship to go. Either get on the same page, which requires considering her feelings, or move on. I already can see a future Post where you ask if you are TA for being mad that your wife never tells you who she spoke to on the phone or saw at a social gathering. Because right now you are requiring her to write off a good friend of hers because you don\u2019t trust that their dating years ago will remain in the past.", "INFO :\n\nDo they have other history other than romantically involved? (like, childhood friends)", "NAH I understand you being insecure/uncomfortable about it. But if they only dated for such a short period of time, it\u2019s likely they realised they\u2019re better off as friends and now they\u2019re good friends. Give your fianc\u00e9 the benefit of the doubt.", "NAH. You\u2019re allowed to feel uncomfortable with this, but I encourage you to try and analyze why it makes you feel that way, if for no other reason then having open honest communication with your partner. Being friends with an ex is not and should not be an immediate red flag. I\u2019m really good friends with an ex of mine, we were young when we dated and we realized that while we didn\u2019t make great partners we did make really good friends. His wife is the most wonderful human, and I was honoured to be at their wedding and I\u2019m still considered a part of his whole family. He will be at mine if I ever get married, and my partner knows all of this. So you\u2019re NTA for feeling uncomfortable, but she\u2019s also NTA for wanting a good friend to be there on what is a very special day.", "INFO\n\nAnd what's their relationship like now? Are they friends who see each other on a regular basis, who hang out as friends do? \n\nHave you ever spent any time with him? Does he strike you as someone trying to get back with her? \n\nAnd when you say they dated for a little bit, years ago, are we talking a month, two at most? \n\nBecause you're focusing on him being her *ex-BF* and she's telling you he is a friend.

It's not like she was dating him and then left him for you.", "NAH - I have a really good friend that I was in a multi-year relationship with YEARS ago.  I was at his wedding - heck my BFF and I made his wedding cake.  I've house/cat sat for him and his wife.  He came out for a weekend to visit my mom before she died and he was at both of my parent's funerals.  IF I was ever to get married I would want him there because I consider him family at this point, so I can completely understand having an ex who is now a very important platonic friend.  But I can also see why it might make you uncomfortable to know that he's there.  Until you two can come to an agreement on how to deal with old friends who are ex's, I would suggest waiting to get married.", "Is it reasonable to have a \u201cno former people you banged\u201d policy for weddings?", "My guess is that this guy is part of her circle of friends, and everyone else is going and the question is whether to exclude him or not?

Doesn't sound like a serious relationship, and even if it were, it's definitively over and ended amicably enough that they're still friends.\n\nYour insecurities are your own to deal with, not your fiance's to tiptoe around. Unless you suspect your fiance may still harbor feelings for this guy (which is the **only** valid reason to be uncomfortable with this), then that's a reason to reconsider the entire wedding, not just the guest list.", "Did she actually say it wouldn't be a special day without him there?\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA.

She dated this guy for a while some time ago, they split up, and have since been good friends.\n\nThat is a normal and healthy thing.

If they weren't friends before dating, perhaps they're friends now. That's OK.\n\nBottom line - you're jealous of her ex. You seem to have this strange opinion that people can't have any contact with an ex. So for that, YTA.\n\n(My wife's ex was at our wedding. He's a nice guy. I'd expect him to be a nice guy, because she dated him, and she'd be unlikely to date an AH.

Each of you has made a demand/line in the sand and is now blaming the other that they aren't considering their feelings. It's time for calm discussion, not angry ultimatums.", "YTA. You aren't allowing her to invite her good friend to the wedding. Sometimes people date and decide they would be better as friends. One of my very best friends is someone I very briefly dates years ago. You make me very grateful for partner who is secure enough to not be threatened by that. In fact, they are now friends too.", "NTA I can see how having an ex at such a big event can be uncomfortable.", "NTA, especially since she mislead you", "But she's not considering your feelings and she's making it all about herself! See... Anything she says about this can be twisted around to be the same exact thing for you! The point is she started out lying to you about who he was, and so that is always going to taint your view of their relationship. It's weird when people can't let go of their exes. Maybe don't get married? Cuz either you're going to be uncomfortable or she's going to be pouty because she didn't get her way.", "IDK In my opinion having an EX at your wedding is weird. But I've never maried so I could be wrong.", "One of my exes is my best friend in the world, and to not have him at my wedding would be devastating.

One of my closest friends wasn't able to make it to my wedding - sure, I was disappointed, but you know what?

My husband and I will be married for 43 years this year, years ago we both attended the wedding of a former girlfriend of his, he was the best man, lol.

Personally, I feel like the fact that you are uncomfortable with the relationship doesn't make you look great here.  Plenty of people stay friends with their exes, and you don't get to decide this for her.  \n\nAs far as the wedding goes, I don't think her inviting him is absurd, nor do I think you NOT wanting him there is.  \n\nBoth of your feelings here are valid.  Hopefully you can come to a resolution", "NTA.

Don't give in.\n\nIt's not too late to reconsider the wedding as it's not only about inviting the ex. It's about-\n\n1. Her hiding the gravity of their relationship in the first place.\n\n2.

Sometimes when we're young, we put a lesser value on any love that isn't romantic love. They dated. It didn't work for them, but they handled things maturely, with love and friendship.

Know the details?", "Honestly this is a major life issue you need to work out before the wedding.

I wouldnt trust a person who lied about their relationship with another person, unless it was deep rooted trauma that they werent comfortable talking about.\n\nThe wedding should be about both of you, not just one or the other. This is something that needs to be talked about more in depth. Including the lying part as being why youre uncomfortable with their relationship. But she also needs to be heard.
