Your perspective is a handful of dates years ago makes him persona non grata to anything in her life at the official moment of your lives being joined, and presumably moving forward. \n\nThere is no where for this relationship to go. Either get on the same page, which requires considering her feelings, or move on. I already can see a future Post where you ask if you are TA for being mad that your wife never tells you who she spoke to on the phone or saw at a social gathering. Because right now you are requiring her to write off a good friend of hers because you don\u2019t trust that their dating years ago will remain in the past.", "INFO :\n\nDo they have other history other than romantically involved? (like, childhood friends)", "NAH I understand you being insecure/uncomfortable about it. But if they only dated for such a short period of time, it\u2019s likely they realised they\u2019re better off as friends and now they\u2019re good friends. Give your fianc\u00e9 the benefit of the doubt.", "NAH. You\u2019re allowed to feel uncomfortable with this, but I encourage you to try and analyze why it makes you feel that way, if for no other reason then having open honest communication with your partner. Being friends with an ex is not and should not be an immediate red flag. I\u2019m really good friends with an ex of mine, we were young when we dated and we realized that while we didn\u2019t make great partners we did make really good friends. His wife is the most wonderful human, and I was honoured to be at their wedding and I\u2019m still considered a part of his whole family. He will be at mine if I ever get married, and my partner knows all of this. So you\u2019re NTA for feeling uncomfortable, but she\u2019s also NTA for wanting a good friend to be there on what is a very special day.", "INFO\n\nAnd what's their relationship like now? Are they friends who see each other on a regular basis, who hang out as friends do? \n\nHave you ever spent any time with him?

I was at his wedding - heck my BFF and I made his wedding cake.  I've house/cat sat for him and his wife.  He came out for a weekend to visit my mom before she died and he was at both of my parent's funerals.  IF I was ever to get married I would want him there because I consider him family at this point, so I can completely understand having an ex who is now a very important platonic friend.  But I can also see why it might make you uncomfortable to know that he's there.  Until you two can come to an agreement on how to deal with old friends who are ex's, I would suggest waiting to get married.", "Is it reasonable to have a \u201cno former people you banged\u201d policy for weddings?", "My guess is that this guy is part of her circle of friends, and everyone else is going and the question is whether to exclude him or not?

Doesn't sound like a serious relationship, and even if it were, it's definitively over and ended amicably enough that they're still friends.\n\nYour insecurities are your own to deal with, not your fiance's to tiptoe around. Unless you suspect your fiance may still harbor feelings for this guy (which is the **only** valid reason to be uncomfortable with this), then that's a reason to reconsider the entire wedding, not just the guest list.", "Did she actually say it wouldn't be a special day without him there?\n\nEdit: NTA", "NTA.

She dated this guy for a while some time ago, they split up, and have since been good friends.\n\nThat is a normal and healthy thing.

If they weren't friends before dating, perhaps they're friends now. That's OK.\n\nBottom line - you're jealous of her ex. You seem to have this strange opinion that people can't have any contact with an ex. So for that, YTA.\n\n(My wife's ex was at our wedding. He's a nice guy. I'd expect him to be a nice guy, because she dated him, and she'd be unlikely to date an AH.

Each of you has made a demand/line in the sand and is now blaming the other that they aren't considering their feelings. It's time for calm discussion, not angry ultimatums.", "YTA. You aren't allowing her to invite her good friend to the wedding. Sometimes people date and decide they would be better as friends.

In fact, they are now friends too.", "NTA I can see how having an ex at such a big event can be uncomfortable.", "NTA, especially since she mislead you", "But she's not considering your feelings and she's making it all about herself! See... Anything she says about this can be twisted around to be the same exact thing for you! The point is she started out lying to you about who he was, and so that is always going to taint your view of their relationship. It's weird when people can't let go of their exes. Maybe don't get married? Cuz either you're going to be uncomfortable or she's going to be pouty because she didn't get her way.", "IDK In my opinion having an EX at your wedding is weird.

My husband and I will be married for 43 years this year, years ago we both attended the wedding of a former girlfriend of his, he was the best man, lol.

Personally, I feel like the fact that you are uncomfortable with the relationship doesn't make you look great here.  Plenty of people stay friends with their exes, and you don't get to decide this for her.  \n\nAs far as the wedding goes, I don't think her inviting him is absurd, nor do I think you NOT wanting him there is.  \n\nBoth of your feelings here are valid.

Don't give in.\n\nIt's not too late to reconsider the wedding as it's not only about inviting the ex. It's about-\n\n1. Her hiding the gravity of their relationship in the first place.\n\n2.

Know the details?", "Honestly this is a major life issue you need to work out before the wedding.

I wouldnt trust a person who lied about their relationship with another person, unless it was deep rooted trauma that they werent comfortable talking about.\n\nThe wedding should be about both of you, not just one or the other.

Your logic is simply so... Off, i can't even comprehend.", "My husband\u2019s former FWB and her husband tore up the dance floor at our wedding. My high school boyfriend was invited but couldn\u2019t make it because his wife was heavily pregnant. They\u2019re all lovely people that enrich our lives and we\u2019re both adults that trust each other.", "Haha one of my fwbs turned into my best friends. His wife likes to joke I taught him everything he knows on how to be a good husband, because while they were dating he\u2019d ask me for advice and I could give a woman\u2019s opinion on it.", "literally just you, your partner, a witness, and the judge (and depending on the city the witness and judge might be iffy too)", "Ahaha I couldn't even invite my brother - he took my wife to senior prom (way before we were married! \ud83d\ude02) When we say lesbian friendship circles are incestuous...", "This, I was like 'this doesn't work in the majority of non-hetreosexual friend groups'. The majority of my friend qroup is queer, as the resident asexual-possibly-lesbian-once-I-get-therapy, I am the only one a bunch of them haven't slept with, and the only one who hasn't slept with any of them \ud83d\ude05 if any of them get married, there will be people they have slept with at the wedding, but there is exactly 0 chance of that leading to a bride or groom sneaking off with a guest on the wedding night", "You do realize that exes are exes for a reason? Why do you call that a romantic backup?\nI\u2018m also friend with one ex as we where together most of my youth/ young adult life (5 years when I was 17-22). I would never get back with him, it doesn\u2019t work out. But we still were together for a long time and know esch other well and we didn\u2019t break up because something happened, but because we didn\u2019t love each other anymore. \n\nMy current partner has no problem with this. He recently visited his ex to see her baby. This was perfectly okay for me, because I know that he loves ME. If you are so afraid of exes you should speak to someone or reevaluate the relationship, because you clearly don\u2019t trust your partner", "\u201cromantic backups,\u201d yikes! What an unhealthy view of human friendship", "you're trying to put people down for not sharing your view on exes. amicable \"break ups\" are very much a thing, especially for something so short like OP's which is why I put it in quotes. working through my own insecurity helped me realize that.", "Idk whether to call this mindset insecure or bitter but anyhow...yikes lol.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s strange. Sooo many people only go to the reception, it\u2019s not like this guys would be the only one going to the reception. It could be a way to meet in the middle because the groom Dosnt want him there at all. And you honestly don\u2019t this it\u2019s strange that her wedding won\u2019t be special with her ex there?!", "Her fianc\u00e9?", "Fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t tell OP about the relationship at first.  She also didn\u2019t say how long they were together she said spring a few years ago.  Depending on where they live spring can be 3 months or more.  She was being very vague.  Maybe the ex is a fall back plan.", "So you're saying that OP should be fine with having someone he's clearly not comfortable to be around on their wedding? \n\nIf that's a yes then you clearly don't understand what boundaries are.", "Lol.  Too many people acting like she\u2019s going to be staring into the audience into this guys eyes as she says her vows or something.", "She did lie about who he was in the first place, only red flag her is OPs fiance.", "My ex husband and his girlfriend came to mine and my husband\u2019s wedding.", "Yes, and irrational. You're getting married. What is going to happen? The bride leaves with her ex? This isn't a movie.", "You really had me in the first half of that, ngl", "It's pretty typical especially among men who can't actually conceive of any reason to speak to a woman except for sex. They usually don't even like their partners, and they literally can't conceive of interacting with a woman for any other reason. So female friendships must be romantic backups - if you're not sleeping with them now, you must want to sleep with them in the future, otherwise why else would you speak to them at all?", "both for sure", "I honestly don\u2019t know of anyone who just goes to the reception - but nobody in any of our friend groups has done a long boring mass in a separate location. It\u2019s just 20 minutes of heartfelt vows and then the party starts right then and there.\n\nIt makes perfect sense to me that her wedding would feel less special if her fianc\u00e9 starts banning her friends from coming. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t trust you or care about the people you value\u201d is a quick way to kill the magic.", "Why would I ignore the relationship with the fianc\u00e9? \n\nShe has friends. Male friends. She dated one many years ago and it ended amicably. The *nature* of the Fianc\u00e9s and Her Friend relationship is called a platonic friendship. \n\nIf OP\u2019s ego is bruised because she had a life before him with other men, he\u2019s going to be devastated when he finds out all women have had a life before their partners and may have dated or slept with their friends.\n\nI\u2019m 100% transparent with anyone I date, that I have slept with certain friends of mine (both male and female).", "Everyone has a different definition of dating and ex. \n\nI can be going on 4 dates over 3 months and to me that\u2019s not even worth being an ex. It\u2019s not vague so much as insignificant. \n\nWhy are you, and op, trying to make it significant when the people involved in this relationship have clearly stated it\u2019s not.\n\nIt\u2019s very toxic of you and OP to insist you know better than they know their relationship", "Brides get to uninvite or even kick out bridesmaids because the color scheme didn't match and the groom should just suck  it up and let the bride invite her former xyz's  at the expense of making the groom uncomfortable? Okay", "No, I'm saying OP should grow the fuck up and get comfortable with the fact that anyone he is ever likely to date is going to have had prior sexual partners.\n\nOr, if he can't do that, maybe he should set a boundary of not getting into relationships.\n\nEdit: Oh, wait, I see you have a post history in /r/survivinginfidelity and /r/CheatedOn. Sorry, but this is clearly a trigger for some anxieties that you have, and I don't feel that you're actually capable of assessing this rationally, so I'm not going to engage you further.", "Did your new husband object to their coming?", "There are no \"friends\" that someone banged before. The fact that they had sex makes this guy way too close for her boyfriend to accept in her life.\n\nShe lied because she obviously wanted to keep things as they were. It was comfortable to have the guy around and she didn't want to make the choice that she had to make. She doesn't respect her boyfriend at all", "Lmfao yes. Been reading too much BORU lately \u2026", "True the misogyny is rife here. What need does she have for old friends now that he\u2019s formalizing his possession of her?", "You asked who would care. I answered your question with a rhetorical one.\n\nHer fianc\u00e9 cares and, contrary to the narcissism that plagues the internet, his feelings on the matter are valid.\n\nThere is a strong emotional bond between them. On a physical level, there is some compatibility because they were obviously attracted to each other enough at one point to start a romantic relationship. These are not points the average person ignores.\n\nIf you want to live your life that way, that is fine. Find someone who does not see it as an issue. Don't try warping the world and gaslighting people into thinking the normal thing to do is just be cool with it, otherwise it is an ego and insecurity issue.", "No? All of that is equally insane bridezilla shit that gets called out constantly.", "No, definitely not. If my husband felt he had reason not to trust my friendships, I imagine he wouldn\u2019t have married me in the first place. \n\nMy ex and I also have a child together. We were horribly toxic as a couple (and early on in divorced co-parenting) but after he got with a gal that helped him grow up a bit, we became friends. I think since I had grown to also be friends with her, it would have been awkward not to invite them to our wedding.", "\"There are no \"friends\" that someone banged before.\"\n\nwtf. Since when?", "It\u2019s definitely insecurity.. on the OP\u2019s part.", "Not really. Refer to previous AITA post  for a contrast.", "a lot of people don't think this is a big deal or worth mentioning. learned that through experience & I agree. we should be asking if he previously expressed that he's shared those boundaries. they sound around my age & he should have brought it up because everyone has different values on \"exes\" & his are more involved. not being friends with exes is a big one people have & the wedding isn't when you bring it up.", "Right so do you think that your experience is relevant, given that the husband in this case *does* have objections?", "Nah", "You mean the one where the bride *bought* the dress of her bridesmaid who agreed to wear it after making a big scene about not wanting to and being offered to come as a guest but not a bridesmaid but STILL went behind the bride's back and wore her own dress? Yeah that's not the same thing at all. That's promise-breaking and disrespect, not baseless insecurity."]}
