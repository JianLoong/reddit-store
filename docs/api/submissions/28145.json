He especially loves when we has guest that when he goes all out for sure, he plans his meal in advance and get extremely excited.\n\n\nMy husband and I had a dinner with our friends and our kids. My husband made us arabic salad & garlic bread on the side with mashed potatoes and braised duck served with a sauce. When everyone came we had 3 parents and 7 children. My husband I served everyone food and everyone was complimenting it but my husband noticed one of my friend let call her Melissa child (6) not eating so he asked him if he didn\u2019t like the food and he nodded his head no and Melissa chimed in and sayed he doesn\u2019t have a mature palette and my husband said sorry, we have more mashed potatoes maybe he can eat it without the sauce Melissa said he doesn\u2019t eat mash. My husband said that fine I can microwave or make him something quick. Melissa said Thankyou and told him frozen chicken nuggets would be good my husband said ooh we don\u2019t eat frozen food but how about cereal , pp&j/ grilled cheese or leftover spaghetti bolognese and she said cereal.\n\n\nNext thing that happened my husband served the ice cream and carrot cake. Mellisa other son(8) said this ice cream was soo good. My daughter (4) said me and my daddy made it we don\u2019t eat the store brought crap.

I was just about to apologize because I never want to make someone feel mommy shamed until this women said she feels sorry for my daughter because she can already see my snobbishness and self centeredness spreading to her because of that comment my daughter made about crap ice cream. And that where I draw a line. I told her to not mention my daughter name when wanting to address me and she shouldn\u2019t worry about feeling inferior because she will never be invited to my home again.\n\n\nOur friend decided to get involve and they keep saying that I should apologize because they don\u2019t want to be left in the middle it and they feel like I was wrong because I should have known the food was too mature for a kids palette. I honestly Don\u2019t care. I have friends outside of this friend group and honestly don\u2019t mind cutting them off.

You were already being gracious by offering alternatives.\n\nThat being said there are some personal areas for improvement on your side of things:\n\nIt was rude of your daughter to call it \"store bought crap\". She is 4 so I don't blame her, but it might be worth a gentle correction.\n\nYour husband didn't need to say \"we don't eat frozen food\". Just saying \"We don't have chicken nuggets\" would have been sufficient. It wasn't wrong, per se, but a different approach would have made your guests more comfortable.\n\nYour husband's comment does imply a judgement against eating frozen food, and based on her request it is clear that is something she does. It is best to avoid criticizing something that another person uses/likes unless your relationship is relatively close.", "If you're fine losing your friend because you refuse to acknowledge that your daughter said something rude, fine. It was rude, regardless of whether your daughter understood that it was or not. That means you ARE the one who should apologize. So yes, I think YTA. It's pretty silly that your husband decided to make all this fancy food knowing that there would be more kids in attendance than adults as well.", "NTA. Melissa is taking that dinner as a personal attack, probably because she already knows she's feeding crap to her kids and feels guilty about not making home cooked meals.\n\nThis is a \"her\" problem, not a \"you\" problem. Though, if you want to smooth things over you could assure her how your husband cooks has nothing to do with judging her and remind her that your husband accommodated her child on the fly!

I never made my kid's issue someone else's...she knew her kid was picky and she knew where she was going for dinner (assuming your husband is kinda known for his cooking). She could have been prepared.  She wasn't and that's probably something else she's trying to blame on you.", "ESH  It sounds like you do judge other people with regards to what they eat and your daughter is learning it.  As for the chicken nuggets, your husband could have simply said we don\u2019t have any and offered the choices on hand.

This doesn't give her any right to insult a child, especially your own daughter.\n\nI would call her back and say something along the lines of, \"I do apologize if you felt mommy-shamed, that was never my intention, however,  it was out of line for you to say what you did about my daughter, since she was just repeating a joke that I had made earlier.\" And I would hope that she would have the common sense to apologize for her part in this as well.

Better off without someone like that darkening your doorstep. \n\nShe absolutely crossed a line when she decided to insult your daughter (not that it was ok to insult you, but that was at least directly to you and you can defend yourself) - and behind her back? She's a terrible excuse for a human.", "Honestly I feel like you were attacked.\n\nShe called and immediately accused you of mommy shaming. That was an entitled and selfish reaction. At no point did you say in your description of events that anyone should feel shame for eating frozen food. Meanwhile you accommodated the picky child to the best of your abilities. A single mom with six children should appreciate anyone helping her to feed her kids, especially when one of them refuses gourmet food and is given several options for an alternative. \n\nYou are kind of the ah though for saying \"store brought\"  instead of \"store bought\".\n\nHonestly though your response wasn't great either. \n\nYou could have just explained what happened was never meant as an insult or put down. You could have told the story about your child repeating a sarcastic remark that you said earlier. Instead you chose to cut her off. \n\nI can't blame you for that as she seems sort of sensitive and entitled. She also projected insults onto herself which is an insufferable trait.\n\nYou and Melissa are both kind of the AH/ESH but not the husband or the children.", "NTA and I'm not sure where the ESH comes from when your husband only stated a fact. You don't have frozen foods. It could have been anything, he was only relaying what happens in your household.

Your friend is making a big deal out of it, but you didn't have to say \"we don't eat frozen food\" (sounds braggy/judgmental), you could have just said \"we don't have any chicken nuggets.\" And your kid was rude (even if it was funny), and it doesn't sound like you ever corrected her for criticizing food that other people eat.", "NtA, tell this female your husband is the one cooking so it's hardly \"mommy shaming\". then tell her get good and call her a scrub", "Gentle YTA because you say you were going to apologize anyway.

She also should have been taking exception to her kid being singled out - as opposed to making things about herself, and that she was \"mommy-shamed\". She - and her kids - were also bad guests, in not being appreciative of what was served, not graciously dealing with the picky-eater situation, not telling her kid to politely eat what was served, and/or not asking what options were for her child (as opposed to trying to dictate an alternate meal option). That all makes her seem a bit entitled. If she is a close friend, she should have known ahead of time that your DH is a bit of a foodie, and either discussed concerns with you in advance, brought a snack for any picky eaters, or politely declined the dinner invite. I think she is more than a little jealous that you have a partner who makes elaborate dinners, while she is trying her hardest to just get through the day.\n\nyour friends - for not staying out of a petty argument that got blown way out of proportion\n\nyou - criticizing your husband (when making the ice cream), and for letting such a petty squabble escalate, and feeling that is worth ending a friendship over. The comment by the 4y/o - I think most people know a 4 y/o has no filter, and often just repeats things - often out of context. Also - your attitude that friends are disposable is not good.\n\nyour husband - pointing out \"Melissa\"s kid wasn't eating, and asking in front of everyone else if he didn't like the food. Not cool putting a little kid on the spot like that, in front of other dinner guests.", "NTA How dare someone bring their picky, immature kid to dinner and not bring a sandwich or something they\u2019re willing to eat. \n\nI say cut them off. You don\u2019t want your daughter being influenced by plebs like that : )", "Not overreacting at all.  Melissa has some nerve.

She's choosing to get offended and take it personal.... that's a her problem. \n\nAnd I don't censor what I say around my kids either. It's a teaching moment. They're allowed to use the full English vernacular as long as it's in the proper context and not directed at someone abusively", "NTA   \nKids say the darnest things and honestly it's hilarious to me. But she probably felt a way bc her child didn't eat anything and her suggestion was frozen food meals. She is projecting on to you and once she made the comment about your child, it was all over", "NTA-from your comments, you corrected her daughter and apologized for the \"crap\" comment at the time it happened.  You should have put that in the post.\n\nThis is strictly about Melissa's projecting her insecurity on you.  She then took it to another level by bringing your child into her issues.  \n\nYou do not owe her an apology. \n\nHaving said that, if you are going to dine with children who you know are not accustomed to the sophisticated palette yours are, it's good manners to have options available for them.  Just as if you were knowingly inviting a vegan adult, you would not offer them meat dishes.\n\nEdited to clarify, I know that you did have options available,  I meant that when they are served, just ask if they are willing to try it, not waiting until someone notices they aren't eating.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Who brings a kid that won't even eat mashed potatoes without warning the host/bringing something their child will eat?", "I say this as someone who thinks all of that sounds amazing, and grew up eating similar: yes. You simplified it to \"rice, sauce, stew\", but we know it's more complicated than that. Texture and spice vary wildly between cultures. Kids have a lot more taste buds than adults. Everything tastes *more* to them. That's why kids toothpaste is rarely mint. If a kid isn't introduced to certain flavors early (and sometimes even if they are), they're going to have a hard time adjusting. Jokes about kids plates all being shades of beige  exist because plain rice, frozen nuggets, fries, etc don't offer much in the way of surprises. You planned a dinner party consisting of mostly children who aren't a part of your culture, and didn't bother to find out what they would like. Not only that, you were surprised that their pallets weren't as \"mature\" as your kids, and didn't plan any alternatives. That would have been an amazing menu for a primarily adult dinner party, but that's not what this was.", "I wouldn't call it fancy. However (not saying that this applies in this case but just for future reference) one thing that's been noted amongst kids with autism or sensory difficulties is a dislike of mixed foods and textures. And even typically developing kids can have neophobia. I've observed eating quirks across cultures -- the specifics vary, but they still happen. I come from a culture where stews or meat in sauce is very very typical but one of my kids is still really picky about it so it's clearly not an unfamiliarity issue.", "lmao. it sounds like you make lots of assumptions.", "Calling bought ice cream \"store bought *crap*\" is going to offend 99% of people because it's a very rare thing to make your own. \n\nIt's a shame that the daughter misinterpreted OP's sarcasm because with context, they sound like nice and accomodating people, but hearing that would absolutely make me nervous to have them for dinner.

You can find one in a proper butcher shop but the price will be anywhere from $30-$60 per duck depending on the size and the time of year. It's not commonly eaten among most households in the continental US, maybe sometimes as a special holiday meal.", "I was just thinking I was fairly certain I\u2019d seen duck in the poultry section and started to think I was crazy.", "Nope not crazy lol. But if someone has never seen it they might think it\u2019s just a small turkey. I know the first time I bought a duck I had to look for it because it was off to the side next to a whole bunch of turkeys", "Its pretty rare in more of the lower 48 grocery stores. Canada is different due to the French influence.", "Its not common in regular American grocery stores."]}
