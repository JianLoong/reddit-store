He goes all out for dinners and even his lazy meals can seem extravagant at times so our children have a mature palette. He especially loves when we has guest that when he goes all out for sure, he plans his meal in advance and get extremely excited.\n\n\nMy husband and I had a dinner with our friends and our kids. My husband made us arabic salad & garlic bread on the side with mashed potatoes and braised duck served with a sauce. When everyone came we had 3 parents and 7 children. My husband I served everyone food and everyone was complimenting it but my husband noticed one of my friend let call her Melissa child (6) not eating so he asked him if he didn\u2019t like the food and he nodded his head no and Melissa chimed in and sayed he doesn\u2019t have a mature palette and my husband said sorry, we have more mashed potatoes maybe he can eat it without the sauce Melissa said he doesn\u2019t eat mash. My husband said that fine I can microwave or make him something quick. Melissa said Thankyou and told him frozen chicken nuggets would be good my husband said ooh we don\u2019t eat frozen food but how about cereal , pp&j/ grilled cheese or leftover spaghetti bolognese and she said cereal.\n\n\nNext thing that happened my husband served the ice cream and carrot cake. Mellisa other son(8) said this ice cream was soo good. My daughter (4) said me and my daddy made it we don\u2019t eat the store brought crap. (This is my fault \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I was mocking my husband earlier asking him what he was making and he said ice cream and I said in a sacarastic way that we are to good for store brought crap huh.

I was just about to apologize because I never want to make someone feel mommy shamed until this women said she feels sorry for my daughter because she can already see my snobbishness and self centeredness spreading to her because of that comment my daughter made about crap ice cream. And that where I draw a line. I told her to not mention my daughter name when wanting to address me and she shouldn\u2019t worry about feeling inferior because she will never be invited to my home again.\n\n\nOur friend decided to get involve and they keep saying that I should apologize because they don\u2019t want to be left in the middle it and they feel like I was wrong because I should have known the food was too mature for a kids palette. I honestly Don\u2019t care. I have friends outside of this friend group and honestly don\u2019t mind cutting them off.

Just saying \"We don't have chicken nuggets\" would have been sufficient. It wasn't wrong, per se, but a different approach would have made your guests more comfortable.\n\nYour husband's comment does imply a judgement against eating frozen food, and based on her request it is clear that is something she does.

A single mom with six children should appreciate anyone helping her to feed her kids, especially when one of them refuses gourmet food and is given several options for an alternative. \n\nYou are kind of the ah though for saying \"store brought\"  instead of \"store bought\".\n\nHonestly though your response wasn't great either. \n\nYou could have just explained what happened was never meant as an insult or put down. You could have told the story about your child repeating a sarcastic remark that you said earlier.

She also should have been taking exception to her kid being singled out - as opposed to making things about herself, and that she was \"mommy-shamed\". She - and her kids - were also bad guests, in not being appreciative of what was served, not graciously dealing with the picky-eater situation, not telling her kid to politely eat what was served, and/or not asking what options were for her child (as opposed to trying to dictate an alternate meal option). That all makes her seem a bit entitled. If she is a close friend, she should have known ahead of time that your DH is a bit of a foodie, and either discussed concerns with you in advance, brought a snack for any picky eaters, or politely declined the dinner invite.

Also - your attitude that friends are disposable is not good.\n\nyour husband - pointing out \"Melissa\"s kid wasn't eating, and asking in front of everyone else if he didn't like the food. Not cool putting a little kid on the spot like that, in front of other dinner guests.", "NTA How dare someone bring their picky, immature kid to dinner and not bring a sandwich or something they\u2019re willing to eat. \n\nI say cut them off.

She's choosing to get offended and take it personal.... that's a her problem. \n\nAnd I don't censor what I say around my kids either. It's a teaching moment.

She is projecting on to you and once she made the comment about your child, it was all over", "NTA-from your comments, you corrected her daughter and apologized for the \"crap\" comment at the time it happened.  You should have put that in the post.\n\nThis is strictly about Melissa's projecting her insecurity on you.  She then took it to another level by bringing your child into her issues.  \n\nYou do not owe her an apology. \n\nHaving said that, if you are going to dine with children who you know are not accustomed to the sophisticated palette yours are, it's good manners to have options available for them.  Just as if you were knowingly inviting a vegan adult, you would not offer them meat dishes.\n\nEdited to clarify, I know that you did have options available,  I meant that when they are served, just ask if they are willing to try it, not waiting until someone notices they aren't eating.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Where I grew up (midwest in the 90s/00s) it's generally considered polite to let people know what you'll be having if you invite them over for food, especially considering allergies and dietary restrictions. \n\nIt also sounds like you've been teaching your kid bad things - not the word crap, but the idea that everyone has the time, money, and ability to cook things \"from scratch\" and that freezer food is inherently bad. (And that eating certain foods gives you a \"mature\" palate). Whether it's because of food intolerances, allergies, or just dislike, getting some kids to eat various foods can be hard, and there are a lot worse things they can be putting into their bodies than frozen chicken nuggets.

Also, if you did have frozen nuggets around, what did your friend expect? For the whole dinner party to wait somewhere in the neighborhood of an hour between preheating the oven and then cooking the frozen food?

It bares emphasis both to you and your friend that this is a discussion about the behaviour of ADULTS. Kids repeat stuff their parents say, they say stuff they don't understand. But it might be an opportunity for you and your husband to reflect on how you both talk about food around your daughter, and to sincerely listen to a friend who felt hurt at least once by such repeated comments. Without intervention this could be a repeated pattern of behaviour and other people might feel hurt or judged by such comments from children in the future, worried that the parents are judging them or talking shit behind their backs. It's not just this one friend but many future friends of your daughter's and the parents of those friends. \n\nIf you, your husband, and your friend are willing to have an adult conversation together where people listen to one another, then that may require a certain amount of humility to change how you speak about food around your daughter, and how you plan to host for families with kids when they come over. You don't necessarily have to acquiesce to your friend or let her speak ill of your daughter, but if you can all allow heads to cool and then enter a conversation with good faith and humility, it may be a valuable experience for each of you and could prevent situations like this from occurring in the future.", "NTA.
