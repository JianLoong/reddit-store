I have the room with the attached washroom (I pay a bit more rent for this) while Max has the smaller room and uses the common washroom. \n\nSo like 5-6 months ago, Max got together with this girl, Ashley (24F). Ashley has practically moved in with us, she\u2019s always here, her stuff is in Max\u2019s room, she rarely ever goes back to her own apartment and acts as if she owns our place. I didn\u2019t care much about it earlier because she used to be in his room most of the time, and it wasn\u2019t causing me any inconvenience. \n\nAround 2 weeks back, when I came back from my classes for lunch, I noticed that the door to my room was open. I panicked cuz I thought it\u2019s some burglar or something but turned out it was Ashley who was using my washroom as Max was using theirs. I was naturally very upset and told her that she shouldn\u2019t have entered my room and used my washroom w/o my permission. She then proceeded to tell me that this *wasn\u2019t a big deal* and she thought i would be okay. I told her that I am absolutely NOT okay with it and that this is a very gross invasion of my privacy.\n\nInstead of being apologetic, Ashley tried to gaslight me into thinking that I was making it out to be a way bigger deal than it actually was and that I was selfish for not wanting to share the \u2018good washroom\u2019. By this time, Max had come and I told both of them that if this was repeated again, I would have to talk to the landlord. \n\nYesterday, Ashley had to pee real bad, and again, Max was taking too long in his washroom, so she knocked on my door and asked if she could use my washroom. I was still pissed off about the incident earlier and about her lack of apology, so I told her she cannot. Long story short, she had  to go and use a public restroom nearby. Apparently it was raining. \n\nShe came back and she was crying. Max was furious at me and called me a heartless asshole. People in our friend circle are divided over this, some feel I should\u2019ve let her use my washroom.

It seems that you are just a little booty hurt about how she handled it.  Like if she would have been more apologetic you would have allowed her to use it. This is petty.

If they need to use the restroom, then use it. So long as they're not going through my things in the process or making a mess to use the restroom, I wouldn't care. \n\nWith that being said, OP told her to ask for permission. She asked for permission as requested, just to still be denied? It was a childish powerplay.", "Definitely childish but his room his rules. I don\u2019t get to dictate what he does and neither should anyone else. Sometimes being selfish is an absolute piece of work but unfortunately that\u2019s how people are like", "But it begs the question of why ask someone to ask for permission in the future if you're just planning to deny that permission? If you don't want someone using your restroom in the future, bluntly tell them it's off limits, don't give an option of permission just to deny it. It's silly.", "I agree but I think through the post you can see that OP was mostly not confrontational. It does raise questions but I can\u2019t say for sure what the answers are since I am not OP."]}
