When I was a teen she asked me when I\u2019d get a boyfriend, when I was in a steady relationship she asked me when I was getting married, and the marriage inquisition became even more invasive after my younger sister (28F) got married this month \u2013 which probably gave my aunt probable cause to label me as the family's \u201cspinster\u201d. \r\n\nIn the wedding party, she kept asking me why I had broken up with my ex-boyfriend, she said how she always thought we\u2019d ended up married soon, and she advised me to get serious about this if I ever plan to have kids, because I\u2019m not getting any younger. It came to a point where I couldn\u2019t keep my mouth shut anymore. Granted, I could have just asked her to stay out of my business, but since she was bringing up things about my personal life, I assumed it was fair to do the same. \r\n\nSo I said something like: \u201ceven getting married is not a guarantee you\u2019d be with someone forever, look at you and Uncle X, I\u2019m sure you thought it would be eternal love yet now he\u2019s with someone else\u201d. It was the same as slapping her in the face; she accused me of being disrespectful and left the table on the verge of tears.

Maybe better luck next time\u201d.", "NTA. While it may be a touchy subject for your aunt, you had a very valid point!

As someone who has gotten the when are you getting married questions for far longer than I have ever wished to... I applaud you!! \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffd Hopefully she won't try that again, and if she's upset, then she shouldn't have kept interrogating you over your own life choices.

My final answer to the when are you getting married questions was _*\"why?\"?*_ I got asked a few times by the same people and when I asked them \"why would I?\" they sputtered and said \" to be happy,\"  I asked them why they thought I couldn't be happy without marriage...? _Crickets.\ud83d\ude10..._ lol.
