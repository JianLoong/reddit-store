The auntie has been waaay to involved in demanding what the OP should do with her vagina.

I ask them \"why, are you going to pay for them?\"' crickets!! \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 People have this idea that marriage and babies are the pinnacle of life. But it never ends.

All it does is make OP sink to a low level. Maybe it would be better to have a private conversation with the aunt, telling her just how awful it makes her feel.\n\nWe're always hearing about how we should \"pay it forward\" - now OP and the aunt are paying it forward in the worst way. The aunt feels awful. Maybe the OP will escape the bad karma - I hope so for her sake, but this is her relative, we're supposed to be nicer to our relatives than other, and I don't think she would have gone out of her way to hurt a stranger like this.", "Thanks!!!", "So did Auntie.", "Yeah, that reminds me of a post where the OP was sick of her MIL asking when she was going to have a baby. The OP finally responded with \"Are you going to pay our mortgage?\" The MIL was pissed but finally stopped asking.", "You sound like a loser.", "Middle-aged married men need their wives to arrange play dates. We are terrible at maintaining relationships.", "Also, my guess is that in the actual moment she likely wasn't scheming in her head like, \"I could just say it's not her business, but instead let me brainstorm how to best kick in her teeth.\" In those moments, especially when it's over and over to a breaking point, sometimes the quickest fix is hard and fast. It's a shame it hit the aunt so badly to the point it did - that was clearly not OP's intention - but it's also a pretty clear cut case of Auntie not being able to take what she herself hands out. Maybe when she was in the bathroom she got a good look at herself in the mirror.
