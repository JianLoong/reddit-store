{"id": 15680, "submission_id": "12yz4ft", "title": "AITA for not wanting to be called a \"work wife\" at the office causing a colleague to get in trouble?", "selftext": "I'm an office manager for a medium sized company, and my job involves both administrative tasks plus \"fun\" tasks like planning team building events, weekly meals, treats, etc. Most of the employees are older (i.e. my parents' age), except for one recent hire who is closer to my age. \n\n\"Matt\" is generally a nice guy and we initially connected (professionally, never outside of work) because we're close in age, but he's recently mistaken some of my tasks (i.e. getting everyone lunch or Friday treats) as special treatment, and has started to jokingly call me his \"work wife\". \n\nI politely told him that he's not getting special treatment, but he thinks I'm teasing and has doubled down to the point that he's using the term in front of colleagues. It came to a head this week when one of my coworkers asked me if I was dating Matt, and when I approached him about it again, he continued to play it off. \n\nThis time, I told him clearly and firmly that he was making me uncomfortable and that if he called me the term one more time I was going to HR to file an official complaint. He still didn't make an effort to change. \n\nUnfortunately, another colleague ended up mentioning the situation to the girl in HR (they were having lunch together), and \"Sarah\" (the HR rep) ended up having a talk with Matt. It wasn't official as I personally didn't make the complaint, and was more of a warning. Still, Matt got really embarrassed and ended up calling me an AH (not directly but implied). He said he was just joking around, and my lack of humor is now putting his job on the line. \n\nI feel bad because he could be in pretty big trouble and a different colleague said I should have handled it privately.", "created_utc": 1682463827, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yz4ft/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_called_a_work_wife_at/", "score": 1705, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It came to a head this week when one of my coworkers asked me if I was dating Matt, and when I approached him about it again, he continued to play it off. \n\nThis time, I told him clearly and firmly that he was making me uncomfortable and that if he called me the term one more time I was going to HR to file an official complaint. He still didn't make an effort to change. \n\nUnfortunately, another colleague ended up mentioning the situation to the girl in HR (they were having lunch together), and \"Sarah\" (the HR rep) ended up having a talk with Matt. It wasn't official as I personally didn't make the complaint, and was more of a warning. Still, Matt got really embarrassed and ended up calling me an AH (not directly but implied). He said he was just joking around, and my lack of humor is now putting his job on the line. \n\nI feel bad because he could be in pretty big trouble and a different colleague said I should have handled it privately.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

He got a warning.\n\n\u2026\u2026 *and then he came back to try and guilt you for speaking up about it?*\n\nYou may not have gone directly to HR last time, but I would have marched my ass there immediately after whatever \u201cimplication\u201d came out of his mouth about you being at fault.  It only did it not even occur to him to apologize\u2026 he just doubled down *again.* The warning clearly did not work. \n\nWarning not enough for ya, bud? Okay. Have fun talking to HR about why you need more than a warning now.", "you should report him to HR for retaliation\n\nalternatively you could simply stop giving him \"special treatment\" and let him die from breakfast but that seems like it'll create more problems than it solves", "This is why people want to wfh. I wouldn't want an office job.", "Maybe his next breakfast is coronation quiche?", "WOW the head of HR?! Wild.", "LOL yep. I guess it's the only way he's going to have sister wives.", "Yep. \ud83d\udcaf agreed.", "I was named work wife by my best work pal, we're both cis women. Apparently, no one else was cool enough to be a work spouse.", "The only work wife I ever had was the one who started calling me her work husband. \n\nThe key difference is that while we met through work we became close friends and spent time together outside of work before we ever joked about stuff like that.", "Uh you know it goes both ways right? I had a girl at work one time always calling me her \u201cwork boyfriend\u201d and told me she even asked her real boyfriend it was alright for her to have a work boyfriend. It was super awkward.\n\nEdit: spelling", "I'm a woman & my work BFF & I refer to each other as work wives... We do an equal amount for each other & have a pretty solid friendship. It's not always a bad thing...", "It looks like it originated in the 1930s, but gained popularity in the [1980s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_spouse#Historical_uses)", "I actually hate the term because it\u2019s exclusionary. That two people are in a club other people aren\u2019t in. Not to mention being disrespectful to the real life significant others. I have legit seen people\u2019s feelings hurt over it, but no one says anything because it\u2019s supposed to be a joke.", "Same haha I prefer girl and miss. Woman and mam make me feel old.", "Yeah me too. Just not at work.", "I am talking about work. Just work. If I worked in corporate for the Spice Girls, under no circumstances would I refer to them as \u201cthe girls\u201d as in \u201care the girls joining us in this meeting\u201d. \n\n\u201cAre \u201cThe Spice Girls\u201d ready to go on stage?\u201d \nSure. No issue.", "I\u2019m a bartender. This is my new catharsis.", "They\u2019re learning though. The last time I tried this tactic on someone they said \u201cif I have to explain it, than I think my sense of humor is just too intelligent for you.\u201d\n\nNow *that* was funny.", "I love this tactic. Keep saying you don't understand and get them to explain it to you over and over.", "Mhm, it's called retaliation and I bet they have a policy against it.", "I suspect at minimum that there would be \\_paperwork\\_.", "Did you miss the first sentence?\n\n> my job involves both administrative tasks plus \"fun\" tasks like planning team building events, weekly meals, treats, etc", "\ud83d\ude43 had to complain to our executive director. We're a small org and the head of HR is an older lady who didn't seem to realize how or why it could be offensive or irritating.", "Also, let me guess, he's in teaching?", "Agreed, also gross and not cool.", "So she asked her real boyfriend if it was okay to use the term, but it never occurred to her to ask the person she was using it on?", "I worked with someone who did that - both were married to other people, but she referred to him as her work husband. I don't know he felt about it, but she made it such a big deal calling him it *every single time*. \"I'm just going to run that by my work husband\" or \"can you just let my work husband know that, thanks\" So cringe....", "Yeah, this is one of those \"if you don't relate, you're not who I'm not talking about\" things. Closeness, friendships, and rapport are absolutely positives when you have solid coworkers - I do specifically mean the types of men like OP described who ASSIGN that role and basically claim ownership of their colleague.", "It's a pet name that's fine so long as both parties are in agreement. It's not something you should one-sidedly put on someone.", "I'm a straight female, when I was in my mid 30's I had a mid 30's work wife who was also a straight female. We spent the majority of our waking life together for years, and shared the stress/trauma of our very toxic workplace. I agree that these terms can be welcomed and endearing, when it is consensual. \nOP NTA, this wasn't consensual.", "I feel like it's only cheating if partners are not ok with it or it's kept hidden from them.\n\nAt my old job, my single coworker eventually became my work husband in the sense we'd do thoughtful things for each other that we might not do for others because the connection was different, but we never hung out outside of work, my husband knew about and was ok with it (he'd even refer to him as it) and everyone was comfortable with the terms. We also didn't use the terms around/to coworkers only when it was just us talking or me referring to him outside of work.", "Yeah, it gets kind of fuzzy in cases like this. A colleague and I got called \"girls\" in a friendly way by a female supervisor once, and she was called out for it by our male boss. I didn't mind her saying that at all, but maybe in general it's best to never call anyone \"girl\" in the workplace, so I just didn't say anything about it either way.", "I only don\u2019t like it because I worry about the \u201cslippery slope.\u201d I feel like if women call each other girls, then the men will do the same, which makes sense, but it\u2019s \u201cdifferent\u201d when two women call each other girls than when a man calls a woman girl. A \u201cgirls night\u201d is different than a professional woman being called a girl by men at work.", "She did. Matt ignored her requests. Requests for him to stop using a \"joke\" that sexual harassment training typically explicitly calls out as inappropriate.", "There's a saying that true intelligence is knowing how to explain the most complex concept in such a way that even the simplest of laymen can understand. Probably could stand to phrase it better, but there you go if you or anyone else gets hit with that retort again.", "Making dinner - knife wife\n\nHaving an argument - strife wife\n\nPlaying a delightful whittled flute - fife wife", "Nursing. \ud83d\ude44", "Agreed, if both people are okay with it, and know that it\u2019s not anything inappropriate, it\u2019s fine. I had a job where my boss and I referred to each other as work spouses. He was the manager and I was an assistant manager at a theater. We were good friends, our SOs got along, and we were both clearly platonic. We had worked together for several years and were at a point where we could anticipate what each other needed in various work situations. If there was a task that needed two people, we would smoothly work in tandem without having to discuss what we were doing. And even though coworkers joked about it, everyone knew it was a strong friendship and nothing more. \n\nThis guy is a jerk, though. It\u2019s not a cute pet name when one of them doesn\u2019t agree to it. OP said she wasn\u2019t okay with it, he kept pushing when she said stop, and people were starting to ask if they were dating. That\u2019s not an appropriate work situation. She even tried to handle it privately but he made it public. He\u2019s embarrassed because he was acting in an embarrassing way and got called out for it.", "Agree totally", "Agreed. This is a pretty easy NTA. OP talked to him directly and privately, but he continued. \n\n\nI was more referring to a post above mine calling these terms hateful.", "oh jeeez that's even worse"]}
