{"id": 15680, "submission_id": "12yz4ft", "title": "AITA for not wanting to be called a \"work wife\" at the office causing a colleague to get in trouble?", "selftext": "I'm an office manager for a medium sized company, and my job involves both administrative tasks plus \"fun\" tasks like planning team building events, weekly meals, treats, etc. Most of the employees are older (i.e. my parents' age), except for one recent hire who is closer to my age. \n\n\"Matt\" is generally a nice guy and we initially connected (professionally, never outside of work) because we're close in age, but he's recently mistaken some of my tasks (i.e. getting everyone lunch or Friday treats) as special treatment, and has started to jokingly call me his \"work wife\". \n\nI politely told him that he's not getting special treatment, but he thinks I'm teasing and has doubled down to the point that he's using the term in front of colleagues. It came to a head this week when one of my coworkers asked me if I was dating Matt, and when I approached him about it again, he continued to play it off. \n\nThis time, I told him clearly and firmly that he was making me uncomfortable and that if he called me the term one more time I was going to HR to file an official complaint. He still didn't make an effort to change. \n\nUnfortunately, another colleague ended up mentioning the situation to the girl in HR (they were having lunch together), and \"Sarah\" (the HR rep) ended up having a talk with Matt. It wasn't official as I personally didn't make the complaint, and was more of a warning. Still, Matt got really embarrassed and ended up calling me an AH (not directly but implied). He said he was just joking around, and my lack of humor is now putting his job on the line. \n\nI feel bad because he could be in pretty big trouble and a different colleague said I should have handled it privately.", "created_utc": 1682463827, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yz4ft/aita_for_not_wanting_to_be_called_a_work_wife_at/", "score": 447, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It came to a head this week when one of my coworkers asked me if I was dating Matt, and when I approached him about it again, he continued to play it off. \n\nThis time, I told him clearly and firmly that he was making me uncomfortable and that if he called me the term one more time I was going to HR to file an official complaint. He still didn't make an effort to change. \n\nUnfortunately, another colleague ended up mentioning the situation to the girl in HR (they were having lunch together), and \"Sarah\" (the HR rep) ended up having a talk with Matt. It wasn't official as I personally didn't make the complaint, and was more of a warning. Still, Matt got really embarrassed and ended up calling me an AH (not directly but implied). He said he was just joking around, and my lack of humor is now putting his job on the line. \n\nI feel bad because he could be in pretty big trouble and a different colleague said I should have handled it privately.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "[removed]", "NTA, you tried to handle it privately on at least two separate occasions.", "Hard NTA.\n\nWhat Matt is doing is called sexual harassment.

First, you told him you weren\u2019t comfortable and he kept blowing you off. Second, you can\u2019t control the actions of other people. He wouldn\u2019t have to worry about his job if he\u2019d said \u201csorry, I\u2019ll stop\u201d when you said you were uncomfortable.", "NTA his job wouldn't be \"on the line\" if he was respectful. IMO its joking the first time before you asked him to stop after expressing you didn't find it cute or funny it became a bit closer to harassment", "NTA, actions have consequences. \n\nYou asked him to stop, he refused and threw a \u201c*hahaha it\u2019s just a jokeeee*\u201d at you, another coworker mentioned it in conversation without you present, without your input. \n\nYou did nothing wrong and dude\u2019s just mad he has no sense of humor or understanding of the word \u201cno\u201d.", "Schr\u00f6dinger's asshole, things suddenly become a joke when they rightly get pulled up for their obnoxious behaviour. \n\nNTA OP.

If someone called my husband that I would be PISSED!", "I agree with all your points, but to point #3 specifically, a \"joke\" could still be problematic and reported to HR by an observer even if OP was laughing along. \n\nSomeone got reported at my friend's workplace for hugging.

Ultimately, nothing came of it, but HR will absolutely take perception into account as well.", "Work wife is just an extension of the misogyny at home for these men.

That\u2019s a pretty strong description for a term that\u2019s not even hateful (though it can be hurtful & painful, as OP experienced when the coworker asked if she and the AH were dating). \n\nAnyway, I mostly commented to say re: your #1 that I actually think about 50% of the time this is used to describe a really intimate will-they-won\u2019t-they relationship that develops between co-workers, at least one of whom is in a real relationship. So, in a fair amount of cases, I think there\u2019s quite a bit of intimacy.", "Idk man as long as both parties are ok with it and find it funny it\u2019s not disgusting.

Non-retaliation policies don\u2019t actually guarantee that there won\u2019t be some kind of retaliation, and in this case, there kind of was - he chewed her out. \n\nCompanies that have robust hr departments also usually expect (through training), that if an employee sees another employee being harassed, or can see their discomfort, they can report it in the victims behalf.\n\nAlso, the whole point of Matt\u2019s kind of behavior is to take control away from the victim.
