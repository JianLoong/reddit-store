If my husband and I would talk to them we'd see that SIL is trying hard to be a changed person and that I should have given her a chance. \n\nPart of me feels bad now, part of me doesn't. I understand that everyone deserves second chances (my husband is seven years sober), but at the same time I don't want to put *my* job at risk to give her that chance.

She staked your reputation on it. You have a right to an opinion.", "NTA for me. Firstly she should've asked you personally if she could use you as a reference and secondly she just assumed that she would be immediately hired because your family. It doesn't work that way at all! Sure if a family member offers to help get you hired like you offered to do for your  younger sister in law fair do's you didn't offer your older sister in law she should've known you would have something to say about it..\n\nMy husband often offers to help get someone he trusts gain employment where he works, as long as they have a stable job history and aren't prone to quitting a job everytime within days or 1-2 weeks. He explained it reflects poorly on him if he recommends someone who has a bad attitude towards work and shows poor judgement of character on his part especially with managers who have come to trust in him as a worker.\n\nHe has 3.people he absalutely refuses to vouch for or recommend where he's employed.  \n\nHe's tried working with all 3 in the past and when one was asking about working at his current job as they were desperate for a job. He had to be honest with his boss when they asked him of his opinion of this person. My husband had to say look  (insert name) is applying their a great person outside of work but they have a xyz issue during work . I can't fully vouch for them as a employee based on my previous experiences when I've worked with them in the past, but on a personal friendship leval that are great at xyz. I have no issues if you hire them but make sure they are on a different shift to me if possible I try not to work with friends/family on the same shifts for a reason.\n\nSo no I agree with others this was not you being  tah in this situation, your boss asked you for your input and you gave an honest opinion. That was far better to do for yourself, your current boss, your work environment  and for your sister in law too. You found out she was under the impression she was being hired via mistaken identity. That was not your fault the boss should've explicitly clarified which sister in law she was by the  name on the application If he did ask. If he did clarify is it possible she lied and said yes she was the younger sister in law hoping you wouldn't find out until she started working there knowing you were the younger sister in-laws reference and maybe hoping she could swing a opps they must've got us confused as we applied at the same time.\n\nWhat is her fault is being mad she wasn't hired based on her interaction and assumption she was without a formal interview. The boss during the shift hours information  and basic questions probably wasn't pleased with the interaction he had despite not realizing it was the wrong sister in law. Frankly yes most bolster their resume or fluff it up to sound more important  but outright lies will be cottoned on to fast in a new job. If she is using her husband as a formal reference or pretending he's a former employer then it shows she hasn't admitted any wrongdoing in her prior work history and is trying to hide that from future employers  The only time I've used a friend/family member was straight out of high school or if a prior place of employment shut down so any previous references have left or are unable to be reached. This was mostly pre cell phones and pre Facebook so it's far easier now than 20 years ago!", "NTA. I'm a store manager and one of the red flags I see in applications is the work history. I have declined to hire people who's employment is spotty or job hopping. Why should a manager hire someone who's not going to stay for a day, week, or at least a month. It's a waste of time and resources.", "NTA.  I wouldn't allow poop on the table where I eat if I could avoid it either.", "Unfortunately, I've gotten two different family members jobs there while they were in college, and MIL knows that my boss trusts my word to a certain extent. But yes, I probably could have gone about it more diplomatically.", "This - a million times over! I worked with a woman, \"Marie.\" Great person, HORRIBLE worker. She ended up getting fired. Without ASKING me first, she put me down as a reference when she was looking for a new job, a reference I would have declined giving had she asked me.\n\nSo, when I got the call from some potential employer, I basically gave a bad reference without actually giving a bad reference. Any hiring manager with half a brain would have known to steer clear. \n\nGuess Marie figured it out eventually or got some other sucker to hire her because the calls stopped, thank God!", "Unfortunately BIL is the golden child and she does not think it's possible for him or his wife to do any wrong. Nothing is ever their fault, the world is out to get them. She likely knew my response would be \"heck no\". If I had it my way I'd avoid the lot of them, but we want to maintain a semi good relationship until his youngest siblings no longer live at her house.", "I\u2019m not seeing it this way. The SIL put OP as a reference, what was she supposed to do when asked?", "The references? You mean her husband? NTA", "Yeah at the very least you probably should have just played it off, like \"oh idk Boss hasn't mentioned anything to me\" \n\nThat's just for your own sanity tho lol. NTA all you did was tell your boss the truth.", "Oh, that's even easier to handle, though it does require some mild truth manipulation. \"Oh, I didn't know she'd applied! You should have told me so I could make sure to say the right thing!\" Then told her that your employer made their decision independent of your reference. When dealing with people like that, you want to tell enough of the truth to be honest without being \"rude\" to them while still giving them the idea you are going to go along with whatever they wanted in the first place.", "[deleted]", "Dang I wish I'd thought of that. Will keep it in my back pocket.", "So the SIL put OP\u2019s name on the resume/application for no reason? Why else would the boss have approached her about it?", "She stated that when SIL dropped off her resume she mentioned OP by name. That is using OP as a reference whether its on paper or not especially since OP is already employed. It is not uncommon for employers to ask employees about potential hires they may know", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "No, the boss brought it up to OP specifically. It says so in the post, when OP used the sentence \u201cboss brought it up.\u201d Did you miss that in your reading of the post that was clearly more detailed than mine? It\u2019s the first sentence of the very next paragraph.", "Jesus Christ the woman said ops name when she dropped of the resume she didn't list her as a reference. It's not difficult to understand", "[deleted]", "What other reason would she have had to use OP\u2019s name, then?", "So you\u2019re assigning intentions that aren\u2019t necessarily there to your reading of the post and assigning an imaginary hatred of in laws to anyone who disagrees with you, based on nothing but the way you perceive the OP wrote the post. Cool story.\n\nBy the way, I like my in laws fine, so there goes your hypothesis.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL\u2019s poor work ethic could have negative impacts on your job if you weren\u2019t honest with your boss about her. If you care about smoothing things over, suggest SIL apply to a temporary work agency. They can normally find someone work fairly quickly.", "NTA family can create conflict at work places.", "NTA\n\nWhen they have to fire her, it will reflect on you. That's the very last thing you want.", "Nta, tell her to cut out the middle man, buy what she wants, and you'll sort your own presents going forward", "Nta", "NTA.\n\n*I understand that everyone deserves second chances.*\n\nNot necessarily.", "I would have simply stated you weren't aware SIL dropped off an application since they did it behind your back and that the positions were already filled since you put in a good word for other SIL. They can't expect you to help if they didn't even bother to ask you or bare minimum tell you.", "More reason to not vouch for someone you don't trust.", "NTA\n\nYour boss trusts your word BECAUSE you don't recommend they hire crappy workers.", "NTA,\nHonestly MIL very manipulative, of course she deserves a second chance just not One that will jeopardize your job and reputation, hell no!", "NTA. Never put your job at risk vouching for someone unless you are 120% certain they won't screw you over in some way and even if you are certain think twice with friends and family. I have friends and family I'd vouch for and others I would actively tell the bosses to avoid.", "NTA", "A safer lie would have been the truth.\n\n\"I think my boss checked her resume, and it didn't check out.\"", "I would have said that you tried to put a good word in for her but that your boss also checks references carefully and a bad reference stopped them from hiring her not you. since it sounds like she cant keep a job long and has been fired often Im sure she has past employers who would not vouch for her.", "NTA She _lied_ that you were referring her and dropped her resume off behind your back. SIL knew you wouldn't want to work with her. Why should you have to be diplomatic?\n\nIf you keep getting crap about this, just point the above out and ask them point blank why they went behind your back instead of asking for your help directly. We know the real answer they don't want to give.", "Ask mil. How is she trying to get better when the number for references on her resume is her husbands. Shes lying before she even gets the job. How can i vouch for her when i know thats how she opperates"]}
