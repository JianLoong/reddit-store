Ever since he started working overnight he\u2019s been really tired (which i understand) but now it\u2019s getting to the point where he sleeps all day long and i\u2019m forced to be with OUR kids for 24 hours multiple days a week. I brought this up to him a few times and asked him would he be ok waking up a little earlier in the day in order to help me, he agreed. He works 7 to 7 and works about an hour out so he gets home at 8 am and has to leave again at 6pm. We both agreed him waking up at 2-3 pm would be better for us, he would get sleep but also spend time with our family before he had to go in. This has NOT been happening. I have to wake him up because he sleeps through his alarms or snoozes them because he doesn\u2019t want to wake up. I wake him at the time we agreed and he gives me a big attitude and stays in bed till he has no choice to get up and get ready for work because of the time. I\u2019ve talked to him multiple times and told him i won\u2019t be waking him up any more if he\u2019s gonna give me an attitude and be mad at me. I also explain to him that i didn\u2019t agree to have 24 hour shifts with no break at all, I feel like it\u2019s not fair. I get he\u2019s tired from work and i\u2019m super grateful but i\u2019m tired too and want to have a break at times too. He always tells me he will change and help out more but he needs time to get used to the schedule, though it\u2019s been 3 months. Am i the asshole if i leave him?\n\nJust to clarify, switching to day shifts isn\u2019t really an option at least right now because he asked his job to switch from days to nights after we had our daughter. He thought night shifts would be easier to spend more time with our kids because he won\u2019t be gone so much during the day, only while they are sleeping, (clearly has been the opposite lol)", "created_utc": 1691449643, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15l09pu/aita_if_i_leave_my_boyfriend_of_5_years_and/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

On those days he's spending 14 hours at work or commuting overnight, so he's dead tired, so tired he's sleeping through alarms, and you're threatening to leave him over it? I understand your fatigue and frustration, but that's extreme.", "YTA, the guy is working 12 hour shifts at night. \n\nThat's not a normal day, a work day is 4 hours less and in the day time. \n\nHe's driving a full 1 hour commute both ways. He must be exhausted. \n\nHe's got 10 hours to try and get enough sleep to go to work again, and you want him to get up early so that he can help with the kids.\n\nYou're expecting him to get up on 6 hours sleep, help with child care for hours, then spend 14 hours either working or driving? No offense but yeah YTA. You're going to cause your husband to crash his car. \n\nHe has days off in the week. Is he helpful then?\n\nAlso, what do you think it's going to be like if you leave? Every day will be 24 hour kid care day.", "YTA. You\u2019ve been doing this for 3 months and you\u2019re ready to take your baby and walk out over this? How committed are you, really?\n\nI\u2019ve worked that shift so I know first hand, how absolutely terrible it is. He also isn\u2019t having fun. It\u2019s work and sleep. During waking hours, you feel like you constantly have the flu. There is a reason that shift is said to take 15 years off your life. \nBUT he\u2019s supporting his family. You realize if you leave you\u2019ll not only still not get a break but also now have to figure out how will you support yourself, right?\n\nSit down and discuss it with him again, but this time, really express your growing resentment and how it\u2019s affecting you. Find out if there is a way for him to move to days and if so, how long it would be.\n\nI don\u2019t blame you for feeling the way you do, but you\u2019re a couple, both struggling in your own way. You don\u2019t walk away over something like this, unless you are looking for a reason to leave.", "NAH and I say that cautiously. You are exhausted and have every right to be. However anyone who has ever worked Night Shift knows it\u2019s so hard on your body. Even if you get 7-8 hours during the day you feel completely exhausted. I did it for 2 years and never \u201cgot used to it\u201d Honestly these 12 hour shifts are what is killing BOTH of you. \n\nI am curious though how many days he gets off a week, and what the arrangement is on his days off. Because on Night Shift if you get 2 days off consecutively it really is only one day because\u2026still need sleep. If he only gets one day off or they aren\u2019t together he is never getting a chance to actually rest.\n\nY\u2019all need to find a compromise because the current situation isn\u2019t sustainable for either of you.", "After reading some of your responses on the comments I\u2019m going to reserve judgement and instead tell you you need some outside help. You need a break. Do you have anyone who could come help you from time to time? Anyone you\u2019d trust to babysit? He can\u2019t give more than he\u2019s giving with his schedule. He needs that job to provide for all of you. But you can\u2019t go on like this forever", "On the days he has off, rotate who gets up earlier.\nSo one day you get a break and a lay in, other days he does. And in the afternoon you can ofcourse still do the normal chores/family activities.\n\nOr perhaps (if you can afford it) a babysitter or family member to look after the kids and go on a date night together. Once a month or something. Can be something as simple as a stroll around the park and an icecream but at least you're out of the house together.\n\nNAH at the moment but yes, you will be the asshole if you leave him over this.", "NAH. I\u2019m not too confident he\u2019s really an asshole but your feelings make sense too. Feels more like a sad situation where his work life balance doesn\u2019t align with what you need from him in the relationship. To play devil\u2019s advocate, his attitude after he wakes up could be in relation to how he feels about his job + overnight shifts. I\u2019m not excusing the behaviour, but could do with more INFO on why he might be sleeping in so much despite having a family he should want to spend time with and take care of - almost sounds like he could be unmotivated or even depressed? (A leap as I have little info, but persistent night shifts can take a mental toll for lots of reasons)\n\nHowever, your feelings are completely valid and if you feel unable to continue then you need to speak to him. Sit him down and communicate that this is seriously making you reconsider the entire relationship given the strain you\u2019re under to look after the kids all the time. In order for him to take you seriously he needs to clearly understand how unhappy this is making you and that you\u2019re finding it increasingly difficult to see a future with him like this. This should give him the kick to either A. Start adhering to what you guys agreed and getting up earlier, or B. Finding another job / Speaking to his employer to establish a day shift routine.", "INFO: if he asked you to wake up at 2-3 AM to spend time with him after you worked a bunch of overtime shifts, and you had a hard time doing it/were grumpy about it, would he be justified in leaving you?", "Nah, 14 hours of work and commute every single day is exhausting. You say he\u2019s sleeping all the time, but it sounds like you are talking 8 or 9 hours of sleep a day, which is a fair bit but he\u2019s also got an exhausting schedule.\n\nI feel like there are better ways to work through this though than breaking up your family.", "YTA. If you want to get an idea of how difficult your request is, switch am and pm. That\u2019s like asking someone who works 7a-7p to wake up at 2 or 3 the next morning before they go to work at 6. Idk why people don\u2019t get that people who work at night need sleep too. Just like you. No one wants to sleep their day away but sleep is required to function.\n\nThe one good thing is that he has a few days off in a row. That first day you might only have him for a few hours but on days off is where you need to encourage help. Unfortunately, being a parent isn\u2019t built with breaks  but he\u2019s doing his best to support you all. You need to try harder in finding solutions instead of immediately walking away from someone who\u2019s trying. If you think you need help now, wait until you\u2019re a single mother.", "YTA and you don't sound \"super grateful\" at all.", "Based on what OP posted for his schedule it is always changing so his body never gets a set routine for sleep. Those of us that have worked like that understand it\u2019s not sustainable while also trying to do other things. Even when he\u2019s \u201csleeping\u201d it won\u2019t be a sound sleep as it\u2019s not a normal time. The 2 hour commute plus 12 hours at work then coming home to a whiney wife and kids the guy never gets a break. \n\nHow much money does the wife bring in or is he the sole provider? If he\u2019s the sole provider where is she going that will help her escape the responsibilities? Maybe should have thought about this before having kids y such a young age.\n\nYTA.

WTF.", "YTA, don't have any more kids because you are still one.", "YTA\nMy dad worked nights for much of my life and it did not magically give him all this extra time during the day. I have some very pleasant memories which start with watching the clock in the afternoon to make him coffee and wake him up on time. Important to note, these happened while I was a bit older and easier to manage, he did not work as long a shift as OP's husband, and he was constantly exhausted but trying so hard to be present in our lives and have a relationship with us.", "Have you considered hiring someone to come help you on the days he\u2019s working?\n\nOr asking for friends or family to help?", "ESH. Both of you made the decision for him to switch to this schedule not realizing how grueling it is on the body. You both naively thought that well if he works overnight he can help during the day. That\u2019s not how that schedule works. It\u2019s exhausting and he is doing 12 hours not an normal 8 so he doesn\u2019t have the luxury of spending a few hours doing stuff and then sleeping. \n\nHe has to sleep because his commute is an hour away. \n\nThe one thing I can recommend from when I worked that shift is for him to relieve you when he gets home for an hour or two. That\u2019s more of a normal sleep rhythm of staying up for a bit after work. \n\nAfter that time, let him go to bed and sleep until it is time for him to get up for work. It\u2019s harder to get good rest when it is interrupted that way.", "NAH\n\nI've done this exact scenario. \n\nHe needs to find a new job if this one isn't working out for your family. \n\nI wish I would've been around to advise strongly against this choice. \n\nSo many people think second or third shift offers more flexibility without realizing you sacrifice your sleep which makes everything harder. \n\nWhen I was working after my divorce second and third shift was fine to raise my kids because I never slept...lol 2-4hours at a time was what I got often working 10-12  hour shifts. \n\nBut even my ex got up before work it was only a matter of an hour or two of actual family time or \"helping\" and when he got off work he needed down time to unwind. (we all do) \n\nThis is no help to you however.

You never feel like you\u2019re best self. \n\nHe did make an agreement with you tho, I understand where you\u2019re coming from. You really  need to impress upon him, how him not honoring his word is causing you to consider whether this can work. Find out why he can\u2019t seem to come thru for you. Maybe he just feels that bad and doesn\u2019t want to tell you. \n\nAnother option to consider, if you have the means, is to hire someone to come for a couple hours of the day to give you a break. Even just to get an opportunity to go lay down with him before he has to get up, would be really nice for both of you.", "You guys need outside help. Do you or his parents live in the area?

Like friend brings her baby over to watch your kids so that you can take a nap/do housework/etc and then you return the favor?\n\nAlso, he tried for 3 months and it's not helping with more family time. I think for his health and well-being, it would be better if he could try getting back to day shifts, so he can be more helpful on his off days", "NAH. This is a difficult time in general for parents of young kids. You\u2019re both exhausted. \n\nI do think you need to consider more of his point of view. You said he sleeps 6-7 hours, which is not true of what he would get out of the schedule you\u2019re asking for. It\u2019s more like 5 if he gets home (not to sleep) at 8 (say he actually sleeps at 9 after a shower/eating/getting in bed) and you expect him to wake up at 2. How safe is he at his job and driving for two hours on the road with not enough sleep? If he loses his job or has an accident, you\u2019ll be in an even worse situation. I know he agreed to the 2-3 wake up, but it\u2019s obviously not working and needs to be reevaluated. It\u2019s not reasonable. \n\nI think you might have unrealistic expectations. He said he could wake up earlier, and probably wants to, but he can\u2019t. He truly needs to be rested for his job. And your financial security depends on that job. \n\nIf you left him, what would get better for you? How would you get more help/sleep? It sounds like a poorly thought out rash plan. \n\nWhat might help is if you have family who can come during the day to watch the kids so you can get a break. When DH wakes up on his day off, have him take the babies so you can sleep. Pump so he can give the newborn a bottle and you can be truly uninterrupted. You said he helps on his days off, so are you getting to sleep more those days? You can\u2019t expect to \u201csleep in\u201d if he\u2019s on a night shift schedule, but you deserve an earlier bedtime or a nap during the day while he handles the kids. That would be reasonable.", "How many hours of sleep do you cumulatively get during that 24 hours?", "Ok so here is my advice. However first thing you need to do is come to him with a little more empathy and understanding. The exhaustion between the both of you is rough so it needs to be on a day off when he is rested.\n\nWeeks he is off 3-4 days. Don\u2019t count the first day off. He feels like a zombie. So discuss and decide on which 2 days of the week you\u2019re giving each other breaks. Doesn\u2019t have to be all day. Both need to express your needs. You want to sleep in one day? Let him know. What does he need? You both need a few hours each a week to just have space. Find the compromises so both can have moments to get recharged. I know you are both very young with a lot on your plate so you have to communicate and agree to see where each one of you is coming from.", "Does he take care of the kids on his days off? \nIf yes then you need to let him sleep. \nI get you are tired but night shifts are the worst. \nAlmost fell asleep driving home when my kids were little on my way back home. \nSo have him take more responsibility of the kids on his day off so you get time to rest. But on the days he\u2019s working, he really need that rest. \nYou dint want him to be exhausted and have an accident.", "Because he is working a terrible roster with terrible hours with a not great commute to support his family, as he should. The man is exhausted and doing the best he can and your response is considering leaving him.", "People calling you an asshole are way too harsh \u2014 you\u2019re also working long hours and not sleeping. You\u2019re not being unreasonable for thinking it\u2019s unfair that only his sleep seems important. But they\u2019re also right that night shift hits different, and driving that far while exhausted is very dangerous. He should absolutely be switching on and off with you who gets to sleep in on his weekends though. His days seem too long for him to reasonably help them, so he should be helping a lot on his days off. That way he can get enough sleep on his work days and get a somewhat restful weekend, and you can catch up on some sleep during his weekend and not be responsible for babies and housework 24/7. He can afford to be a little extra tired on the weekends if he gets enough rest during the wee\n\n\nLong term, sounds like he needs a different job with a shorter commute, or y\u2019all should maybe consider moving closer to his job at least. My partner also does nights, we don\u2019t have kids but I still feel for you a lot.

You do need time for yourself. But I don't think leaving him will be the best course of action for everyone involved, primarily including your kids. I believe this can be solved with some clear communication, agreement, and sacrifice on both ends.\n\nMaybe pick up a part-time job to reduce the hours and stress he is working while also giving you the break away from kids that you need. It won't be easy, considering you'd both be working and caring for the kids, but it will split the workload between the two of you, which may help you both out in the long run.\n\nThen again, you could save yourself and leave considering that you're not obviously happy, which you should be. I don't know your relationship with him, so that's entirely your decision. \n\nHope the best for you both.", "he does help i\u2019m not gonna say he\u2019s completely useless but i still get up with both kids, get them something to eat and get the day started which is frustrating because i would love to sleep in.

I'm going to say that they are about equal. Both make you feel like shit, all the time.\n\nAs a first suggestion - \n\nWaking up to an alarm after not having enough sleep is hard. Staying awake after arriving home from work is often easier, as there is a bit of a wind-down, leftover awakeness from work/driving. \n\nCould he arrive home at 8am and stay awake for an hour or so to spend a bit of time with the children?", "I think this is a really good comment, you don't want someone who's exhausted looking after children because they'll be incapable of doing a good job.", "about the same as him. some days less, my daughter has acid reflux so some nights she\u2019s up crying for hours at a time.", "Probably at some point when she's not at work for 12 hours.      \nIt's not a competition.          \nI've been a SAHM with 2 kids.
