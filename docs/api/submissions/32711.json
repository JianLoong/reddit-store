You have a respectable profession that, depending on what type of law you practice, could well make you wealthier than your brother. Good luck!", "NTA. Funny thing is, your brother might end up infertile or child free, that would be karma. But having kids expecting they exist to provide you with grandkids & elder care is just rude. OP is NTA and he gets to live his best life - far away from them.", "respect is earned, and not just freely given because someone is \"older\" or a parent. Family need to earn their respect as well.", "NTA. Why should you show someone respect when they so blantly disrespect you?", "NTA but I don't see this as favouritism, to me this is just point blank homophobia, cut them out of your life and find better support.", "I am shocked by this revelation!    I am gay therefore I am unreliable??  Seriously that\u2019s the best dad could think of to say ??", "NTA.  The problem with old fucks is that they can't comprehend that respect is earned and not given.  They feel that they are owed respect just because they are old.  It isn't that type of party.", "NTA- I can be your honorary aunt . My nephew has spent the last few Christmases with us because we are accepting and his very religious parents aren\u2019t. Win for me as I love him and he\u2019s great company and sad because it should be a choice for him because we are so fun and not because he feels more comfortable being himself at our house - he should feel equally comfortable everywhere. He\u2019s working and far way this winter so we won\u2019t have him and I\u2019m sad.  Good luck in all you do and I hope you have the best life and make your own chosen family.", "Several years back, my dad (currently late 70s) met my best friend's partner. They're both male. My dad is Catholic, grew up in a small town, in post-war Germany, and I doubt he had so much as a ten-minute talk with an openly gay person in the first 60+ years of his life.\n\nAfter meeting said partner, he talked about them as if they were friends. When I told him that they were a couple, his only reaction was \"well, he seems like a nice young man\" and asked for clarification on what he did for work.\n\nJust because someone is older doesn't mean that they can't be accepting.", "And the so called supportive family isn't actually supportive OTHERWISE they wouldn't be chastising OP for defending himself and instead would be on a war path against the homophobes. Be respectful? WHY IS THIS ALWAYS what people say to the victims? Respect is a two way street and OPs father has not done ANYTHING to warrant respect. He also has clearly stated he doesn't view his son as really family anymore. OP it's time to either go NC or LC with your family. I'm sorry to say you don't have any real allies. You clearly don't rely on your father for financial assistance so why even bother talking to the homophobe? I'm sorry this happened to you and that your father's love is conditional and your own twin doesn't back you up. That sucks. NTA and I'm giving you a huge hug from NY.", "Exactly! OP, you are only required to give others the same amount of respect they give you. Your father and grandma were hateful to you, and thus deserve nothing more than disrespect from you. Your other relatives also suck for thinking you need to quietly accept their mistreatment. You are the only person in the right here.", "Agree NTA OP cut these toxic people out of your life.", "I don't see it that way. It seems like the father wants nothing to do with him. And him choosing to cut his father out of his life is actually the goal the father had to begin with.\n\nThe father isn't looking for submission or respect, he has already washed his hands of his son.", "We don't talk much, just pleasantries hello and bye, he stayed silent while all of this unfolded", "Yes, I want to know this too!", ">In my community respect for elders is a given, regardless of how they act\n\n\nThen your community has a lot of growing up to do especially since people like yourself just admitted to enabling them. \n\nStop enabling the assholes in your community and \"regardless of how they act\", will no longer fly. \n\nPs: also come from a culture like that and no, we are changing things.", "When I told my grandma that my best friend came out to me (I told my grandma everything, she was like my mother/best friend), she told me about when she was young. There were gay couples then too, but they were \"old bachelors\" and \"spinsters\" that lived with their bachelor and spinster \"friend\". \n\nThey went to church, participated in the community, babysat, sometimes adopted children, etc. They were just like everyone else, and everyone knew they were gay, it was a \"don't ask, don't tell\" situation. \n\nSo, at least in my area, being gay isn't a new thing and the older people shouldn't have anything to get used to beyond it not being a public secret anymore.", "Yep. My mom had some horrible 2nd wave feminist ideas when i was a kid, but now she has learned better at 76. I mean, the science helped her stop being horrible. Yes, people are gay, it's a genetic thing. Yes, being trans has some scientific backing. I mean, I had to yell at her sometimes, but she got better, even tho she's old.", "Yeah there were gay people *everywhere*.  Suspected gays got beaten up and left for England when my grandparents lived in Belfast.  My BFF's family are from a small Ontario town - they had two \"best friend great uncles\" who lived together.  A friend's family in China has two \"good friend\" aunties who share a studio.", "In the 70s and 80s in the US it was a sort of known/unknown for some gay couples to work around marriage inequality with adult adoption. The older partner would adopt the younger (still adult) partner in order to get legal benefits like inheriting property and making healthcare decisions.\n\ud83c\udf08*The More You Know*", "If your brother is willing to back you up- get him to pick a crappy nursing home for your dad.\n\n*Shady Pines, Ma*"]}
