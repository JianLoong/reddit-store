So you can either ignore the request, tell him that you have no pull with HR or the department he is interviewing for or just say that you don\u2019t mix business and personal anything.

I'll never do that again", "NTA don\u2019t put in a good word for people you know at your job. When it goes south it can look bad on you. I\u2019ve seen so many people regret putting in a word for someone at their job.", "Yea I could never go if I didn't receive an invite lol.", "90 percent of answers point out your invite was probably lost. Also, they all suggest you ask the cousin directly. You've answered everything else but that one thing: why don't you just ask???\n\nIt's highly unlikely you weren't invited, so everyone here is curious - would it hurt to ask her, even in a roundabout way?"]}
