You also admitted to drinking at work which gets people fired.  Coffee breath is pretty bad and as a non coffee person I notice it. Vodka also totally has a scent and can be spelled on peoples breath. Also learn what an Irish coffee is.

I bet the reasons are getting looser and looser.  Pretty soon, you will be having a drink because the traffic was bad coming into the office and then one before you leave because that traffic will be no better.\n\nThe only plus here is that alcoholics in the big 4 are unnaturally common.

Like you I grew up more middle class, and actually spent my high school years in total poverty. Somehow out myself through college and through many years of hard work, I ended up at a Big 4 like you. I do know what you mean about being surrounded by people whose privilege oozes from every word they say. Discussions of boarding schools and top universities and vacation homes. So I totally sympathize with feeling not quite equal. And I also understand the cutthroat culture that exists in parts of these firms.  And you clearly have a problem with alcohol. So for all of those reasons, I did not want to say Y T A - but your reaction to your coworker was totally out of line and the fact that you thought she was the AH shows a huge lack of awareness and a desire to pin your problems on others.", "YTA on so many levels.

I deal with competitive shit by competing, not using LQ to cope. Your coworker was not wrong to report you.
