A few weeks? A year? YEARS?\n\nYou're never gonna be the AH to me wrt not wanting to be touched, just whether I think your response seems proportionate to me.

Frankly, it's not the \"right\" way to respond, no, but it's a completely earned one on their part.", "YTA, but because of the reaction and not your desire not to be touched.", "How can you not see yourself as TA?   Your description of the situation shows her intent as a friendly greeting, not an attempt to make you uncomfortable.  While I understand that she is aware of your feelings on being touched, she easily could've simply forgotten after hugging the rest of your family.  There's nothing wrong with having an issue being touched by others, however that is YOUR issue and it's YOUR responsibility to prevent/correct people without pushing or yelling at them.  If you continue to act like this your problem will work itself out, as no one will be looking to hug you.", "ESH\n\nsigh, unfortunately, you do too.\n\n> Yes, I could of/should of said it nicely.\n\nExactly. \"Please respect my boundaries. I don't like being touched.\" If you wan't to get very formal, \"I did not consent to a hug,\" works too.\n\nAnd here is the thing, your actions lost you the moral high ground, so everyone not thinks you are the unreasonable one.\n\nYour sister should have known better. Your mom should not require a hug.", "I\u2019m sorry all of these scenarios have to be fake right?

Since you don't want them, it is up to you to find a socially acceptable way of avoiding them. Saying \"don't f*cking touch me\" is not such a way. You could hold out your hands in front of you, saying \"please respect my boundaries, I don't want to be touched\" may be hurtful to the other party, but that is on them, especially if they already know of this boundary. So, YTA for the way you dealt with it.", "YTA I would have asked you to leave too. There's nothing wrong with saying nicely, but you chose to be hateful.", "YTA - for having a huge overreaction.

Sure, you could have deflected the hug in a nicer way, but your mom and sister are to blame in this situation.", "ESH, you are for your over the top reaction, a simple \"Please respect my boundaries\" would have sufficed and you should have apologized to your sister for making her cry by making a scene and shouting at her.\n\nYour mom is for not respecting your boundaries. \n\nYour sister is depending on her age, if she is old enough to cry alone in the public bathroom without your mom keeping an eye on her she is probably old enough to understand boundaries.", "ESH\n\n* You for your words,\n* your sister for hugging you when she knew it wouldn't be welcome,\n* your mother for asking you to hug your sister.\n\nIn my opinion, you still owe her an apology for your language.\n\n*edit : spelling correction.*", "I acted like an asshole.

And your mom is her enabler.", "ESH. She should not have tried to hug you.

You know I don't like to be touched.\"", "I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt here and go with NTA \n\nOn the assumption that they have had fair warning that you were against physical affection \n\nI'm very much the same way, It makes me very uncomfortable, I would have removed myself from that lunch before submitting to a hug.\n\nCould you have been nicer about it? Sure, but the way you handled it pretty much guarantees that your sibling will think twice before trying that shit again.\n\nMaybe just make it up to her down the line with a small gesture", "NTA:  I don't know why people are so upset OP said \"dont fucking touch me\"  to me that's an appropriate response when someone who you told numerous times to respect someone boundary and they still continue to do it.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nSorry, but I think your reaction makes perfect sense to me. Harsh? Sure. Necessary? Absolutely. You don\u2019t see someone forcibly handshaking do you? So why hugs? If she was approaching you directly about to hug, then ye, no shit you would have quite an irritated reaction - people should ask to hug, or like with handshakes and put their arms out waiting for the recipient to mirror their actions.", "ESH\n\nYour family needs to respect your boundaries, but that reaction was over the top.", "Honestly I get you. I\u2019m the same with being touched. And if you\u2019ve told them over and over that you don\u2019t want to be touched it\u2019s NOT an overreaction.

I suppose you could have said it nicer, but apparently saying it nicer (many times over) hasn't had the desired effect with your family members. How many times should you have to \"say it nicer\" before they get the fucking point?\n\nTheir disregard for your autonomy is inappropriate - like the suggestion that you get tactile therapy. People are different, and you're on the other end of the spectrum than they are regarding touch. So what? They need to learn to deal.\n\nNTA. And no apologies are necessary for a grown adult (your sister) who can't seem to remember not to touch you after years of reminders.", "NTA - My step brother is EXACTLY the same. He hates hugs. I forget about this a lot though, so I go in for a hug when I see him then he backs off and I remember \u201cshit, sorry!\u201d But that\u2019s it. I\u2019m adult enough to respect his boundaries and not make a big deal of it when I don\u2019t get a hug from him.

I don't really speak to my sister or my mother mother than I have to idk why.

It was a valid response to someone overstepping a boundary they are very aware of.", "NTA. You have repeatedly expressed your aversion to being hugged. With that said, if you have an interest in continuing a relationship with them, you can apologize for what you said, BUT you aren't sorry that you don't want affection and are tired of your boundaries being stomped on and if they don't respect your boundaries you won't hang around them anymore.", "NTA. Consent is consent is consent. \n\nAnd \"no\" is a complete sentence. You've repeatedly told them both over and over again what your boundaries are, and they have proven they don't care. \n\nAt this point, I think you're entitled to use whatever language necessary to be sure your boundaries are met, if not respected. \n\nIf your sister hadn't gone in for a hug, this wouldn't have happened. And running to the bathroom to cry reeks of Main Character Syndrome and making it all about her victimhood instead of the fact that she violated your boundaries. \n\nIf you can manage it, I'd go either LC or NC with these family members, and say, \"you've proven that you cannot follow simple instructions and don't respect my right to control who has access to my body. Until you can prove to me that you're an adult and that my boundaries will be followed, you don't get to see me.\"", "NTA. You have an already established boundary and you are well within your rights to say \"don't fucking touch me\" when someone violates your consent.\n\nThat's what it comes down to. Consent.

While I agree that OP should have and could have handled this in a MUCH more diplomatic way it also sounds like she's very tired of explaining her boundaries to her family. There's only so much a person can be disrespected and ignored before they snap. Sounds like this day was OPs day for snapping.\n\nEdit: OP, for what it's worth, I do think once things have cooled down it would be a good idea to apologize to your sister for the way you reacted and make it clear it happened because she's refusing to respect your boundaries, not because you don't love her.", "Oops lol", "Years.

That was years ago. *Years* and they all still remember that I don't like to be touched unless they ask.

My mum never forces me to give physical touch, and I've never been a physically affectionate person, maybe before the age of 7 yeah but once I got to my teen years? Hell no.

OP even says their own mother doesn't respect their boundaries, just like their sister. You're right that having boundaries constantly overlooked and ignored can make someone snap.

Also, your sister's age. If she is at least a teenager, then definitely NTA. If she's 5 or 6, then maybe. \n\nAlso, I am really sick of people like your mom thinking that everyone should be just like them. Different is not always wrong.
