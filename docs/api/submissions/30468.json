But you\u2019ll be pretty lonely.\n\nYTA", "In my mind the first two sentences made it clear but I can see how it lacks context", "Lmao no. People don't need therapy to accept people walking all over their boundaries, you go to therapy to deal with the aftermath of that.", "\"Oops lol\" was because I missed spelled apologize.", "That's fair, in this context I would have gone for a sarcastic joke that embarrasses the sister while maintaining composure and not turning heads. Not something I'd brush off just because of a social situation though, especially not knowing the cause OP doesn't like physical contact.\n\nI absolutely would not want to be associated with anyone who touches me without consent though, blood ties or not", ">That doesn't give you the right to make other people feel uncomfortable by saying don't fucking touch me in the middle of a restaurant, as if she's being harassed by a creep she doesn't know\n\nWhy not? Because someone may be uncomfortable? OP was already being made uncomfortable\n\n>A simple \"we've been over my boundaries a thousand times now, stop pushing them\" would've done the same job, without the assholery\n\nBut it hasn't made a difference despite being said for YEARS. Nothing short of \"DON'T FUCKING TOUCH ME!\" was going to make it stop. \n\nI would be on board with calling this an overreaction if it was the first time, but it wasn't. OP has expressed their desire to not be touched for years. For years their polite pleas have been ignored. I don't care if the other patrons in the restaurant were uncomfortable or if the sister was embarrassed. OP was being made to feel uncomfortable, and making everyone uncomfortable was the only way to stop it. And when they finally got the message, they kicked OP out of the lunch.", "You're right. It's not SA it's just plain old assault. Touching someone when they've told you they don't want to be touched is a criminal offence.", "Yea, cause family NEVER sexually assaults people.\n\nIt has to do with consent, you don't lose your right to consent over your own body because you are related to someone by blood.", "Nah fuck that. They wouldn't listen to you when it was said nicely. You can apologize if you want but I don't feel like you owe them one. I had a coworker who I got along really well with, but they liked to pinch my nipples messing with me. I told them nicely many many times \"I don't like being touched\". When he pulled my beard I kicked him in the balls, punched him in the chest and very loudly told him \"I will fuck you up!!!\" He got the message then.", "Shouting 'don't fucking touch me' to your own sister just because she tried to hug you is so unbelievably unhealthy. I know reddit is filled with a bunch of shut in nerds, but jfc, how can you not see how damaged he is? There's clearly some fucked up reason he can't handle physical contact.", "But if OP has touch aversion bad enough they cannot stand an arm on their shoulder in a family photo (where everyone is touching, because you're usually trying to fit as many people in the cadr as possible) therapy seems in order.", "After viewing your profile an your other posts....my reply still stands. You sound like you enjoy being an AH", ">Why not?\n\nBecause it's not other people's problem that you've got a problem. **it's a goddamn hug**. And you just said yourself nothing else was going to work, so just leave if your discomfort is that bad. Don't scream at people and clearly she yelled to some level or no one would've looked. She made a scene and made others uncomfortable because she was uncomfortable and then refused to apologise and came to reddit for validation. Not just an asshole, immature as well.", "I\u2019m sure the DA will pursue assault charges against the sister. \ud83d\ude10", "Literally no one here said family can\u2019t sex assault family. That\u2019s the dumbest thing I\u2019ve heard in awhile. You\u2019re MOST likely to be sex assaulted by family. Obviously.", "Um touching nipples is really different from a friendly hug. Jesus. Welcome to reddit, where every interaction is SA.", "There's a fucking huge difference between sexual assault and your sister wanting a hug. Reddit is crawling with precious people, get over yourself.", "For various reasons people don't like being touched. PTSD is only one potential possibility. There are people with extreme sensitivities to anything sensory, autistic people come under this umbrella. Just because someone does not want to be touched, does not mean they need therapy. If anything, people who force people to tolerate it are the ones who need therapy. Though I think OP completely overreacted and should apologise for how they upheld a boundary, sister should also apologise for trying to force the boundary out.", "OP is unlikely to press charges. But that doesn't take away from the fact that she could if she so chose. And you're the one that brought up \"this has nothing to do with SA\" when it was clear theassholethrowawa was just using it as comparison as to how people are constantly ignored when they try to establish boundaries.", ">friendly hug\n\nThere's nothing \"friendly\" about a hug when the person doesn't wanna be hugged.", ">There's a fucking huge difference between sexual assault and your sister wanting a hug\n\nThe similarity is that in both instances someone didn't want to be touched by another person. The other person continually disregarded those \"don't wanna be touched\" feelings until someone snapped on them. It doesn't matter who the person wanting to touch you is, nobody should be subjected to a physical touch they don't want.", "OP can\u2019t press charges against anyone. Crimes are charged by local district attorneys and federal prosecutors on behalf of the community. They decide whether to charge cases, and there\u2019s no chance they would charge a sister trying to hug a sister. You are correct that if they have an unwilling victim that will often influence their decision, although they do sometimes pursue domestic violence and rape cases with unwilling victims because their job is to protect the community at large not the victim. The OP can\u2019t (and didn\u2019t suggest she would) \u2018press\u2019 any charges. That\u2019s just not how our system works. Victims have influence but no power to decide.", "Someone not wanting a hug has nothing to do with it being friendly gesture or not. Just because you perceive it to be malice doesn't mean it is.", "It's still just not the same as sexual assault. Coming from someone who's going on 7 years therapy because of sexual assault, I just find it straight up offensive that someone would compare that to a fricken unwanted hug. Stop being so precious.", "I compared it to something that literally happened to me. \n\nAm I not allowed to do that because you also went through something bad?\n\nAre you the gatekeeper for what people should and should not be comfortable with? \n\nCan you at least disagree with me without insulting me by calling me \"precious\" over and over?", "All I'm saying is your discomfort doesn't give you the right to make others feel uncomfortable, not that others have the right to make you feel that way or that I'm trying to gatekeep feelings lol. Actually read what I'm saying. It's called hypocrisy to expect people to make you comfortable if youre just going to turn around and make others feel uncomfortable just because youre not. If you can't even handle being called precious because you can't see that, then you've got way bigger issues than thinking people have the right to make others feel uncomfortable because of a hug.", "I don't think it's cool to make other people uncomfortable just for shits and giggles. I also do not think it's cool to make someone uncomfortable as a preemptive measure. \n\n>It's called hypocrisy to expect people to make you comfortable if youre just going to turn around and make others feel uncomfortable just because youre not.\n\nOP wasn't yelling as a preemptive thing, OP was yelling as a reaction to being made uncomfortable (by way of unwanted physical contact) despite years of pleading to not be touched. In my opinion, in that instance, it was morally sound to yell. \n\nJust as me punching a coworker would generally be a bad idea, I feel it was justified because my punching him was a direct reaction to him pinching my nipples and pulling my beard despite my repeated requests for him to keep his hands to himself. \n\nIf OP had been left alone and then yelled at them it would be a different story, but that's not what happened here. OP had been asking to not be touched for years, and family members kept ignoring that request because they believed their desire for a hug superseded OP's desire to not be touched. \n\nWhether it's pinched nipples, a hug, an ass grope, a beard pull, or any other unwanted physical contact; I personally believe that any and all force necessary to stop the unwanted physical contact is absolutely justified. \n\n>If you can't even handle being called precious\n\nI can handle being called precious, but resorting to insults demonstrates that your stance has very little validity. Your entire opinion on this boils down to \"just a friendly hug from a family member\". I believe that this is a bad precedent because it revokes someone's bodily autonomy. It's neither my place nor your place to decide what OP should or should not be comfortable with."]}
