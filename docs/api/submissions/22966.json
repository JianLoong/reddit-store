Bedsides some small cleanliness issues on her end, we get a lot really well. We\u2019ve lived together for about 7 months now. We met from a mutual friend that is a flight attendant. My roommate is gone a lot and i deal with a lot of house chores alone. ( not not say it bothers me) however my roommate made friends with a friend flight attendant, and the friend and I DO NOT GET ALONG. I don\u2019t mean to be dramatic because I never have problems with people in general, however hers and my personality do not mesh. My roommates friend has been over a lot recently. Which bothers me but that\u2019s her friend.\n\nTonight they went out and so did I. After getting back I wanted to wash my laundry, I saw that there was clothes in the wash so I added a pod to it as we normally do (since she\u2019s gone often I usually add to or do laundry or keeping up based on what is left behind) after they gets back after a night out\u2026\u2026..the clothes are entirely ruined. Her friend insists i pay for her clothes as she left a red lipstick in the shorts pocket of her clothes and it ruined the laundry. I usually am supper calm but this time i went off\u2026 she began talking down to me and yelling when it truly was just a mistake. After getting treated so crappy i stopped and i said \u201ci feel so bad that that happened however you shouldn\u2019t  have left that in the clothes\u201d it\u2019s not that seriousand the damage is already done. She insisted that I pay her back for the new clothes that she had just bought and \u201chow dare I wash the clothes without checking because if it was her she was going to check the clothes before she washed them.\u201d I told her this is our home. I wash the laundry when things are in the washing machine, so I\u2019m sorry that happened, but I\u2019m not paying for things. Her friend has been washing her clothes in the sink very vigorously and very dramatically and this proves the point of why her and I do not get along. Am I the asshole for refusing to pay for the clothes that she ruined with her own lipstick that she put in the washing machine?\n\nUpdate: this happened last night. I got home from work today. My roommate was gone and had left for work. As I walk into the apartment her friend is there showering doing her own thing like nothing happens. I had thought about it all day and texted my roommate her friend needs to leave. I was screamed at and belittled the night before by her and refuse to be around people that treat me that way. She left after I told my roommate. Am I being dramatic for not wanting her friend around me too?", "created_utc": 1690120476, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/157fg71/aita_for_not_thinking_i_should_pay_for_my/", "score": 118, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But no reasonable person thinks it's sensible to put half a load of laundry in the washing machine, then take it out again later to check the pockets.\n\nThis is doubly true if your household has a habit of throwing your laundry all in together, and adding laundry to half-loads of someone else's.\n\nNTA", "Woof. She put clothes in the machine and didn't check them beforehand, am I following? To make sure her pockets were empty?\n\nBecause once something is in the machine, that's a universal signal it's ready to be washed. Someone not doing their own due diligence - in someone else's home - is on them for being sloppy.\n\nAlso, if you move out in one month then good riddance. 21 is actually pretty young so this as a response makes sense. Wait it out and move on.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. If you throw your clothes into another person\u2019s washing machine, you\u2019re responsible for what happens to them. It\u2019s already bizarre to me that someone would just throw their clothes in with a friend\u2019s laundry anyway, especially without checking the pockets. \n\nI\u2019m not sure if your clothes were in that load and got ruined too, but if they were, you are being pretty calm and forgiving already, since she left lipstick in your washing machine that could have ruined your clothes too!", "This person threw her clothes into the washing machine without checking the pockets herself, ruins all the clothes in there, and expects you to pay for the damage done to her clothes?\n\nLOL\n\nNTA", "INFO... Were the clothes that you washed already in the washing machine?", "She should be paying you for potentially fucking up the washing machine. She is tge one who put lipstick in the wash. Nta.", "NTA  \n\n\nIf she would check the laundry (her words provided by you) before doing the laundry wouldn't she have prechecked her thrown in laundry, clearly getting ready to do it?  \n\n\nSounds like a whole lotta bs from her since she just tossed em in lol", "NTA. If she isn\u2019t there her friend isn\u2019t there. Her friend is using it as a cheap place to crash on her route. make sure she didn\u2019t give her a key", "She was yelling and screaming at you in order to make you feel bad. She knows it was her fault the lipstick was in the wash. She doesn\u2019t want to admit it. She\u2019d rather you pay to replace her things. That was what all the yelling and screaming was about. We all know she was not going to take the clothes out of the washer to check pockets. No one does that. \n\nGood for you for standing up to a bully. It has probably worked in the past so she did it to you. She is a crappy person, and your room mate will figure it out the hard way, since she doesn\u2019t seem to mind how this friend treats you", "Your roommate's guest left her clothes in your washing machine without a word? Just dropped them in,  without checking her pockets,  and then toddled off for a night out? \n\nWho does that? At my house,  it's just my husband and me & due to his job requiring extensive travel,  it's just me most of the time and we STILL don't put anything in the washing machine until we're ready to wash a load.\n Pockets get checked twice- once when they go in the dirty clothes basket and again when the clothes go into the wash.\n\nNTA and she's an AH just for thinking it was ok to leave clothes in your washer.  With shared equipment,  you can't tie up the machines like that,  especially as a guest. \n\nYou owe her nothing.", "If the room mate is not in the house, the friend should not be in the house.  She should not have a key.  She does not pay rent.\n\nI agree with you about the clothes in the wash.  In there are clothes in the machine, it means the pockets have been checked.  This system has worked for you and room mate.\n\nWhy were the friend's clothes even in your washing machine?  She doesn't live there.\n\nNTA", "NTA. She wasn't going to check it again. She made a mistake and then made up the \"i was going to check again\" thing to shove the blame on you and try to make you pay for her carelessness.\n\nShe had no business Washington her clothes in your place and I think you have every right to kick her out and have a serious conversation with your roommate, this person should me allowed back in the apartament and your roommate can move out if she doesn't like it.", "Nta \n\nShe ruined her OWN clothes by giving the universal \u201cthese clothes are ready to be washed\u201d signal, by sticking them in the washer. Not only shouldn\u2019t she be there when your roommate isn\u2019t, I wouldn\u2019t allow her back period. Fuck that!", "NTA. If she didn\u2019t want the clothes to be washed, they shouldn\u2019t have been left in the washer. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s not your fault that she left the lipstick in her shorts. \n\nTell her and anyone giving you a hard time about this to go pound sand.", "NTA\n\nHer friend should be paying for all the clothes that are ruined.  She left the lipstick in there and put them in the washing machine.  \n\nFrankly I would tell your roommates friend to get out there and then and tell her she is no longer welcome and never to come round again.  If your roommate doesn't like it then tough.  You both have to be happy with anyone who is there so if you don't like someone then they aren't allowed.", "NTA for the clothes or the confusion. Your roommate's friend sounds awful", "NTA. You should ban this awful person from your home AND sue her for putting a lipstick in your washing machine.", "NTAH It was in the washing machine. Was She going to go back and check the pockets? Completely her fault.Also, you live there and should be comfortable in your own home. You have the right not to let her stay in your place anymore.", "Wth there's plenty of grease removal products that would resolve this. I guess in future just take her stuff out if you need the washer bc she wants to do it herself. Nta but she's flipping nuts", "YTA to yourself for being a pushover on chores instead of making them do their own chores and own laundry. Should've just taken it out and put yours on.\n\nNTA for the whole thing btw, you were trying to be nice and let them get their clothes clean first and if the shorts made it to the washer she wasn't gonna check them again for the forgetting lipstick, that's on her. She shouldn't be doing her laundry at a friend's shared house anyway.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
