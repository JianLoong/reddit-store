My wife (25f) is in her wedding party and will be attending the trip. When the trip was first planned there was a total cost of around $500. $300 for the lodging and $75 ish for travel and then a wild cost (in my opinion) of $130 per person for a single meal. There will be other small costs of traveling but in the ball park of 500-600 which is pretty typical for a wedding party trip.\n\nMy sister was also initially planning for them to have 2 themed outfits which is pretty typical and expected.

She has now decided there will be 6, yes 6 matching/themed outfits for a two day trip. My wife does not have any of these additional outfits and we are having to purchase them to a tune of another $250 plus an additional gift of lingerie which will be ~$50. Making the total for the trip well over $800.\n\nI texted her yesterday and asked her if she could stop adding unexpected expenses to her bachelorette and she got very upset and started accusing me of telling her how her trip should be. Which honestly I did not explicitly say, however I am annoyed by the 6 matching required outfits for 2 days being the reason more money was added. So maybe she is right. Either way am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I am making an Edit to clarify my wife's thoughts on the situation, because the comment explaining her thoughts got buried. My wife is very much on the same page as me on this. It\u2019s actually my wife who had most of the issue with the costs of the trip originally and we are very much in agreement on how ludicrous my sisters requests are.

You have done nothing wrong in reaching out to your sister privately. I guess since it's your sister, your wife preferred you talking about the matter to her.\n\nAlso I wonder if this is the bachelorette expenses, what is going to happen to the actual wedding day expenses?\nWill your sister ask the guests to fund her honeymoon?

Grow the hell up.  That said, she is your sister, and if you can truly afford it, make her happy.  But also consider all costs, what do you need to do for the actual wedding or wedding gift.  Someone asking for six outfits for two days is going to be high maintenance in regards to hair/makeup/jewelry day of, plus wedding shower.  \n\nI think I have reached the point where all brides like this are assholes.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause this did not involve you in any way, it was your wife's decission to have that discussion or not.", "Oof this is a bit of a tricky one\n\nI can see why your sister wouldn't want to feel policed. She really wants a special trip to mark one of the most special occasions in her life and I can absolutely see why the little notice and spiralling costs is a difficult situation for you and your wife. \n\nObviously for some it would be a completely manageable ask but depending on your financial situation it can be a huge burden. Especially for 6 matching outfits for only two days. That is a lot, seeing as most adults don't need to get changed 3x a day regularly lol. That said, matching for the fancy meal, maybe even matching pyjamas and matching for an activity all makes sense for the aesthetics and photo opportunities and it would also make sense for other activities (eg pool/beach photos) but it could have been planned better and included in the original financial estimates. \n\nOverall, I don't really think you're an asshole. I think it's completely understandable but probably could have been approached in a better way. Maybe your wife could have told your sister that finances are running tight and she's really unsure on how much more she can budget for outfits. It's possible they could have come up with something, maybe even borrowing something matching off one of the others (if they are a size match) or found a way of doing it within a budget. \n\nI think your sis is probably mad at the way you asked can she stop adding unexpected things to the expenses. Maybe drop her a text (or better yet, call) and say sorry, you didn't mean for it to come across like you're trying to tell her what she can/can't do for her bachelorette (I love that term, I'm a Brit so we have hen parties lol) but you're just really worried about finances and don't want your wife to miss out or not be able to do the things sis wants and possibly cause her any upset on her trip. Explain how you really want it to be as special as it can be for her and how she deserves that, be kind, tell her you love her and that you're just feeling the strain, especially with it being a last minute addition and didn't mean to hurt her. & remember to emphasise how excited your wife is to be joining her for this trip and how happy you are for her to be properly included too. If it's possible for you to have made it all work the way your sister wants tell her that, but also tell her you're maxed out and can't pay for anything else on top now. \n\nI'd also like to note that I do think Bach/hen parties have gotten insane the last few years. The whole social media making it seem like you need a huge thing is a little insane to me & even for my own/friends/families hen parties I've always preferred the ones that are just a lovely meal followed by crazy night out clubbing wearing stupid tacky accessories, playing the insane inappropriate games & then heading home with a sore head and some junk food. So please forgive me if I'm slightly biased to these trips that require so much effort. I'd be socially tapped out after one day haha.", "The way you\u2019re analysing every little detail is coming across as a financial abuser, trying to control what your wife is spending on a holiday to celebrate YOUR sisters upcoming wedding!

I saw one where the groom\u2019s name is Jack and so the bridesmaids all dressed up like various characters named Jack. But the good thing about a theme like that is you probably don\u2019t have to go out and buy something new unless you want to.\n\nAlso saw one where the bride and bridesmaids all dressed like Elvis. That one would\u2019ve involved some spending, but it sure was hilarious.", "For my sister\u2019s we went bowling and then to a comedy club. I was grossly pregnant(son was 10 days old at the wedding) so bowling was quite comical. \n\nI don\u2019t remember my first one, and I didn\u2019t have one the second time around.", "These wedding expenses seem reasonable, but the bachelorette costs are ridiculous.", "You\u2019re right - those sound fun!", "I\u2019m not broke, and it\u2019s definitely bonkers.", "my guy, as another lifelong new yorker, unless you're getting a 24oz at Luger or something, nothing about $130 for one dinner is 'standard'.", "Every addition to costs is a new invitation and opportunity to decline.", "I would not ever spend that amount of money to be in a bridal / groom party. The most I spent was buying a new suit for my sister's. And that was like $350.00 and I've worn it since then so it is more worth the expense.", "NTA\n\nI am concerned for the bride that her two day trip will have more time spent getting ready for, rather than enjoying the activities.", "$130 \"dinner\" lmao", "NTA. have your wife tell your sister she cannot do all of the extra. The three is good but beyond that, she is out. If your sister gets upset, your wife can drop out of the party. \n\nShe is going way overboard...", "There should have been a group chat about the planning. MOH and your sister are major AH\u2019s", "Yeah. The matching outfits are a very new thing. I\u2019m 36 and too old to be doing that sort of thing.", "Thanks for saying this. I was wondering if I was ancient at 42 or if my friends were just poor. This was not a thing in my circle at all. We all grew up solidly upper middle class so not wealthy but it seems like now everyone does these elaborate weekends and it seems insane to me.", "NTA. They are gonna change 3 times a day? That\u2019s stupid as hell lol", "NTA, especially based on your edit. Whilst your sister can add costa to her trip if she wants, she needs to understand that these kinds of frivolous expenditure isn\u2019t ok for many people and that people will drop out or be resentful on that basis.\n\nIs she actually asking for a gift of lingerie??", "NTA. What ridiculousness.", "First off NTA\nSecond, I've seen a couple AITA asking about bachelorette parties going crazy that mention matching lingerie... Why do they need that???", "I planned my own bachelorette because we pre-planned an elopement. HOWEVER, since I was the one who planned it - I paid for it! The girls who came were only asked to wear some type of all black outfit while we went out to bars and they paid for their own drinks. I brought the silly little activities that we didn't even do and gave the girls gifts and had a good time! A bachelorette party is supposed to be about bonding with your friends for the last time as single person...this whole thing gives me vibes that sis is planning her event around what will look good on social media rather than to he with her friends", "Does your sister actually want her friends at this bachelorette, or would any mannequin in the approved costume do?  That may be a way to get through to her that she's more concerned about what people look like than her favorite people themselves.  It kinda sounds like the high expenses are secondary to her \"vision.\" I'm getting Instagram Infection vibes.", "Social media happened."]}
