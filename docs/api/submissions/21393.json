My wife (25f) is in her wedding party and will be attending the trip. When the trip was first planned there was a total cost of around $500. $300 for the lodging and $75 ish for travel and then a wild cost (in my opinion) of $130 per person for a single meal. There will be other small costs of traveling but in the ball park of 500-600 which is pretty typical for a wedding party trip.\n\nMy sister was also initially planning for them to have 2 themed outfits which is pretty typical and expected. My wife already had these outfits so we were all set. Everything was fine I was a little bit annoyed with the $130 dinner but whatever it\u2019s something she wanted to do for a good memory so we went ahead and paid for it all no questions asked.\n\nHowever, this week (3 weeks before the trip) things changed. She has now decided there will be 6, yes 6 matching/themed outfits for a two day trip. My wife does not have any of these additional outfits and we are having to purchase them to a tune of another $250 plus an additional gift of lingerie which will be able ~$50. Making the total for the trip well over $800.\n\nI texted her yesterday and asked her if she could stop adding unexpected expenses to her bachelorette and she got very upset and started accusing me of telling her how her trip should be. Which honestly I did not explicitly say, however I am annoyed by the 6 matching required outfits for 2 days being the reason more money was added. So maybe she is right.

As soon as it involves someone else's money, they have a say too- 6 outfits for 2 days is ridiculous either way.\n\nIf she is allowed to add ludicrous expenses to the trip, your wife is allowed to back out too.", "NTA- I\u2019m saying this as someone who had my bachelorette weekend recently. For 2 days, you have 1 maybe 2 themed outfits. One for each night. 6 outfit changes over two days is out of control. \n\nWhy is your sister planning her own bachelorette weekend? That\u2019s something the MOH is in charge of. The bride gives a general idea of what they want to do and then is surprised by the events.", "NTA, so many outfits is an absolutely ridiculous request.", "NTA \n\nSome people lose all common decency and reason when they get engaged \n\nYour sisters requests are too much", "NTA\n\nHer wedding, her day. But she's not in control of what comes out of her guests bank accounts.   \nAnd I'm always baffled by these expenses for wedding guests. $800, thats about 70% of my monthly fix costs.", "NTA.", "NTA OP.\n\nWhile I know it's your sister's bachelorette party and you're not involved in it, your wife is, thus the finances do affect your household. You have done nothing wrong in reaching out to your sister privately. I guess since it's your sister, your wife preferred you talking about the matter to her.\n\nAlso I wonder if this is the bachelorette expenses, what is going to happen to the actual wedding day expenses?\nWill your sister ask the guests to fund her honeymoon? I have read enough AITA posts on such issues.", "NTA-I don\u2019t get any of it.  I don\u2019t want to wear any matching outfits.  I would be embarrassed to ask anyone for any of this crap.  Grow the hell up.  That said, she is your sister, and if you can truly afford it, make her happy.  But also consider all costs, what do you need to do for the actual wedding or wedding gift.  Someone asking for six outfits for two days is going to be high maintenance in regards to hair/makeup/jewelry day of, plus wedding shower.  \n\nI think I have reached the point where all brides like this are assholes.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBecause this did not involve you in any way, it was your wife's decission to have that discussion or not.", "Oof this is a bit of a tricky one\n\nI can see why your sister wouldn't want to feel policed. She really wants a special trip to mark one of the most special occasions in her life and I can absolutely see why the little notice and spiralling costs is a difficult situation for you and your wife. \n\nObviously for some it would be a completely manageable ask but depending on your financial situation it can be a huge burden. Especially for 6 matching outfits for only two days. That is a lot, seeing as most adults don't need to get changed 3x a day regularly lol. That said, matching for the fancy meal, maybe even matching pyjamas and matching for an activity all makes sense for the aesthetics and photo opportunities and it would also make sense for other activities (eg pool/beach photos) but it could have been planned better and included in the original financial estimates. \n\nOverall, I don't really think you're an asshole. I think it's completely understandable but probably could have been approached in a better way. Maybe your wife could have told your sister that finances are running tight and she's really unsure on how much more she can budget for outfits. It's possible they could have come up with something, maybe even borrowing something matching off one of the others (if they are a size match) or found a way of doing it within a budget. \n\nI think your sis is probably mad at the way you asked can she stop adding unexpected things to the expenses. Maybe drop her a text (or better yet, call) and say sorry, you didn't mean for it to come across like you're trying to tell her what she can/can't do for her bachelorette (I love that term, I'm a Brit so we have hen parties lol) but you're just really worried about finances and don't want your wife to miss out or not be able to do the things sis wants and possibly cause her any upset on her trip. Explain how you really want it to be as special as it can be for her and how she deserves that, be kind, tell her you love her and that you're just feeling the strain, especially with it being a last minute addition and didn't mean to hurt her. & remember to emphasise how excited your wife is to be joining her for this trip and how happy you are for her to be properly included too. If it's possible for you to have made it all work the way your sister wants tell her that, but also tell her you're maxed out and can't pay for anything else on top now. \n\nI'd also like to note that I do think Bach/hen parties have gotten insane the last few years. The whole social media making it seem like you need a huge thing is a little insane to me & even for my own/friends/families hen parties I've always preferred the ones that are just a lovely meal followed by crazy night out clubbing wearing stupid tacky accessories, playing the insane inappropriate games & then heading home with a sore head and some junk food. So please forgive me if I'm slightly biased to these trips that require so much effort. I'd be socially tapped out after one day haha.", "The way you\u2019re analysing every little detail is coming across as a financial abuser, trying to control what your wife is spending on a holiday to celebrate YOUR sisters upcoming wedding! It\u2019s a one off, get over it.", "YTA - give your wife the money and let her go have a good time with your sister.\n\nCan you really put a price on making your wife happy and smile?

I want to say no one is an asshole, it's her event and she should be free to organize whatever, and you should be free to cancel if you think that's not worth the money.
