{"id": 3096, "submission_id": "z35m6e", "title": "AITA for snapping at my In-Laws for saying my husband \"ruined\" his life?", "selftext": "**EDIT/SMALL UPDATE BELOW.**\n\nContext\n\nMy (36f) husband (36m) comes from a family of athletes; they put him in boxing as a kid. He was talented and he suffered a lot of pressure from his family. They wanted him to become professional but my husband never wanted that. In high school, things got worse for him as the school's coaches were brutal and the attention he received from promoters and outside coaches led his family to put more pressure on him. The relationship with his family went south when he informed them he was going to university and giving up boxing for good (not true the boxing part).\n\nI met him a month before we started high school and we've been together ever since. When he was 30, his family contacted him to try to fix their relationship; their relationship is decent, the same with me.\n\nNow, we took our children on Sunday to visit them. SIL and her husband were talking about one of my nephews learning to play the piano and that he is good for his age. Then MIL said and quote *\u201cbe careful, you don\u2019t want to \u201cencourage\u201d him only for him to quit and ruin his life as (my husband\u2019s name)\u201d.*\n\nIt seemed like MIL forgot I was there and they went silent (my husband was out buying some things with his father and his other 2 BIL). I was calm and asked her how he ruined his life, his sisters got involved and said that's not what MIL meant and I wouldn\u2019t understand. I replied:\n\n*\u201cNo, I don\u2019t understand; I don't understand why you wanted to live through him, why you never listened to him, why you never accepted what he wanted, why you didn\u2019t let him be, why you think he ruined his life, I don\u2019t get it. If you think it\u2019s because I don\u2019t know how talented he was, you\u2019re wrong because I was there, even when you abandoned him, it wasn't for nothing that he got two scholarships and people were after him. I'd understand if he didn't do anything with his life, but that\u2019s not the case. He has a degree, an amazing career, built 2 different business, is a great father and husband. He is more successful than all of you combined. Please, tell me how he ruined his life or what part I don\u2019t understand\u201d.* I got silence.\n\nI took our children and left; I texted my husband that I was going home. He arrived shortly after and told him what happened and he\u2019s not mad. To be honest, this is the first time I heard this type of comments and I pretty much blew the relationship he has with his family and apparently also caused issues with his sisters' husbands because they had a different version of why my husband was estranged.\n\n**EDIT/SMALL UPDATE:**\n\nI never expected this much attention and sorry for not answering every comment, I will clear some points and give you a small update.\n\n* First of all, thank you for the kind words and the awards, I reacted on instinct and kind of regretted, but my husband reassured me that it was fine, he would have done the same thing for me (which I know). He\u2019s all smiles every time I see him.\n* I\u2019m sorry for those who went through the same thing, I'm glad you left that horrible situation and that you are doing what you want. Good job!\n* I should have been clearer, MIL says he ruined his life because he wasted the chance to be recognized and famous, something they always longed for and couldn't achieve on their own.\n* My husband stopped competing once he finished university and not after high school, he had to do it so he could maintain his scholarship.\n* The children weren't present when I exploded, they were outside playing.\n* His sisters lied to their husbands about the reason why my husband was estranged. They put the blame entirely on him and downplayed what they did.\n* Someone linked a story about a couple who is dealing with the after trauma and it's heartbreaking. Injuries and trauma are two of the many reasons my husband never wanted to make boxing his career. Fortunately, he received minimal damage and sees a specialist once a year to make sure everything is fine.\n* My husband says that over the years he felt something was off, so he's not surprised they haven't changed their opinion of him and that they were just faking it to gain access to our kids.\n\n**Small update.**\n\nEarly today when we dropped the kids off at school, his sister\u2019s husbands were there and wanted to hear my husband version. We went to have breakfast and he told them everything. From their reaction, it was clear that their wives were still downplaying the whole thing. According to one of them, his wife is starting to display the same traits as MIL, so yeah. \n\nWe agreed to talk on Saturday to plan how are going to move forward with our children. They go to the same school and are very close, we don\u2019t want to disrupt their relationship.\n\nAs for his parents, we are going to talk to them on Saturday to let them know how their relationship with our children and us is going to be from now on.\n\nThanks to all of you again.

The \"fuck-if-I-know\" what's in here punch that even the host can't verify because people add their own alcohol to it.", "Right?!", "Yet horseback riding is the leading cause of sports-related traumatic brain injuries. For every boxer that dies from injuries related to the sport in the world each year, a hundred horse riders die. In the U.S, for every person that has done boxing the last year at least once, you have about five people who\u2019s done horseback riding at least once. Horseback riding has way more serious injuries and deaths per capita.\n\nFor an overwhelming and absolute majority of boxers, the injuries are limited to a few black eyes and some skin abrasions. Not even a fraction of a percent reach the point where they get permanent brain damage.\n\nIf you actually look up statistics and not go by gut feeling, there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that horseback riding is a far more dangerous sport than boxing.\n\nAnd it\u2019s also animal abuse.", "Sounds like she thinks he ruined her life not his own or at least her plans for her life", "I agree it\u2019s 100% animal abuse but when I\u2019m talking about injuries I meant long term impact not so much immediate injuries.", "I love how Julia kept addressing Marjorie by her name, while schooling her!", "NTA, MIL FAFO. So many acronyms, but yeah\u2026 if she didn\u2019t want to hear your response, she shouldn\u2019t have made that comment.", "What did they tell your BILs ?", "How can parents want that for their children is just pretty sad. True assholes these parents.", "She also gets a say in how much contact their children have though.", "OP doesn\u2019t need to apologize", "See, to me that is close enough to the truth that they could have put two and two together on their own.\n\nLike if I spent time with a family and they whined a bunch about how one member \"ruined his life\" by quitting a sport and leaving the family even though they were *so* supportive and encouraging I would think, \"Oh. This is one of those families that looks at a kid with a talent and sees a meal ticket. They probably put way too much pressure on him. He left because they're like this.\"", "OP, you done nothing wrong so NTA", "Barf. Get your own life, parents! Good on your husband to have had the cojones to be his own man.", "Man, sounds like they missed a million after school specials", "I hadn't thought of this show in YEARS \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 Thank you for reminding me this existed.", "Pardon my English, it's not my native language. My husband pointed out the same thing when he read the post lol, good thing it's still understandable.", "What does OPs husband need to improve on?  He is a successful businessman, and a loving husband and father.  Just because he didn't want to pursue a career in sports does not make him a failure.", "NTA. Why didnt MIL and SIL pursue a career in boxing instead of living vicariously through their son/brother? \n\nOh that\u2019s right, they\u2019d probably give up the first time they got punched in their stupid mouths. Put up or shut up.", "NTA. Your husband\u2019s family members are batshit crazy if they believe that your husband ruined his life by quitting a sport that involves constant head injuries.", "OP, BRAVO!  to you.  Your defense of truth to all the lies told by your husband's parents is magnificent.  Absolutely, unequivocally NTA.", "There's nothing great about being famous aside from the money and I'm sure they know that and wanted a piece of it. They seem like exploiters. NTA. You're a unit. You protect a spouse that is worthy of respect. They needed to know. I hate that MIL said this and believed it. I don't like her. It's like her child isn't even a child he was a failed ticket to stardom for her. What a loser she is", "NTA", "NTA. This seems like a cautionary tale for why you should never try to live vicariously through your kids. Your in-laws sound cruel and miserable and make me thankful that my parents  never behaved like this.", "OP - I\u2019m late to your post but I\u2019m so happy for you and your family.  You and your husband are in the same page, and so are the BIL\u2019s, so I expect there will be change, or at least, constraint by his family in the relationship(s).  I think the sisters were heavily influenced by the parents, and may need to have a sit down with them too, for hubby to set them straight.\n\nHuge Kudos to you and hubby!", "Man reading this is heartbreaking, you guys are definitely in the right", "I'm sorry your daughter suffered that kind of pressure, I saw how awful it is. Good job listening and letting her choose what she wanted before things got even worse.", "And possibly hurt yourself or stress yourself to the point of being unable to focus on your education.", "Same goes for parents forcing their religious and/or political POV onto kids as if there is no other choice. My parents were religious zealots and made my life miserable. I left home at 16 the week after I graduated high school, and moved 2,000 miles away from their influence.", "You did very well; I certainly didn't realise that English wasn't your first language.\n\nSorry to have pointed it out - it just tickles my sense of humour when a typo is so perfect that it improves the rest of the writing.", "Include me, as I'm a TV \"snob\" who only watches sports. I loathe drama and reality shows. So what does your comment mean, please?", "You are probably kinder than I am but if it was me I\u2019d go NC and not let the family have contact with your children. It won\u2019t be a loss for them. NTA."]}
