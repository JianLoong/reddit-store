And good for you for standing up for him too. Sounds like you're both better off without them in your life.", "NTA if this is real. It's giving me a lot of \"that happened\" especially because you can remember verbatim what you said? I don't buy it.", "NTA \n\nApplause to you defending him! \n\nLiars gotta lie in the bed they made", "NTA for defending you husband, especially when he wasn't there. \n\nYTA for insulting them in your response \"more successful than all of you combined\".

It would likely be understood as you were really just standing up for your husband.", "NTA and congrats on your speech. Well done, you!", "NTA", "NTA - they obviously still haven\u2019t changed. They\u2019ve been on their best behavior to regain access, but it\u2019s clear they still feel their actions were justified.\n\nGood that you and your husband know now so you can decide what to do early.\n\nIt\u2019s very sad, because apparently no success he has can be enough for his mom.

Millions of people have longed to do the same, and we're all living vicariously through you.", ">this is the first time I heard this type of comment\n\nJust because you haven't been around for most of these years.

The parents and sisters (who have apparently been lying to their husbands) all needed to hear your perspective.

She collapsed under her head coach\u2019s pressure to perform above her comfort level.  I talked to the head coach about her feelings of being rushed up a level and coach shut me down.  So I talked to her choreography coach and asked her thoughts.  She told me HER story.  She was her parents\u2019 planned meal ticket.  She was pressured to perform, made it to a high level but not the Olympics, her parents were soooooo disappointed she had let them down, and she ended up hating the sport.\n\nSo I went home and asked my daughter what SHE wanted to do.  She didn\u2019t want to compete any more but this was \u201cher sport\u201d and she didn\u2019t have another high school sport.  So we decided she would recreation skate and high school team (casual) skate through the end of high school and, aside from team, no more competitions.  A good choice for her\n\nShe ended up going to a college with one of the top competitive figure skating programs and world recognition.  She never took the ice in the 4 years she was there\u2026 not even to rec skate.  She\u2019s finishing her doctorate at one of the best schools in the country.  So it was the right move for her.\n\nSounds like OPs husband was in the position of the choreography coach\u2026 a planned meal ticket.\n\nOp nta", "Yeah, I know this is the first time OP had heard it but I wonder how often her in laws say stuff like that amongst themselves. She just happened to catch them slipping up.", "How did I not know \"punch drunk\" referred to being hit a lot, not getting drunk on delicious, fruity punch?", "The risk of injury in boxing is highly exaggerated and does in no way compare to the risks of i.e american football, horse riding, gymnastics or ice hockey.\n\nBoxing is not what it used to be, and top level fighters don't do 20 fights a year as they used to because we know the consequences of that in this day and age. I'd honestly be much more concerned sending my kid to football training than boxing.", "They have a right to an opinion and she has the right to not deal with it when it is aimed at her husband\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f someone could have a whole list as to why don't like my spouse and I wouldn't give 1 shit about how they feel, and I'd tell them to fuck right off.", "The head trauma associated certainly goes. How many Boxers or MMA fighters are in the news because of horrible behavior linked to either steroids or head trauma. Boxing is barbaric.", "Sounds like your husband did amazing. This is exactly what HS athletes should do, use your athletic talents to go to good schools and have the career you want. Being a professional boxer is dangerous and difficult and if his heart wasn\u2019t in it, he would\u2019ve been wasting his life on something that may or may not have turned into a lucrative career.", "NTA\nAnd it was very nice of his coach to help him out", "If all it took was them passingly forgetting she was present to be overheard this once  you can assume probably pretty often. Especially if it's a bitter, \"don't do this or you'll wind up like blacksheep of the family\" kind of familial culture shit.", "That made me cry. How sad. And so unnecessary. I remember seeing how much he declined too. How a parent can push a kid in a sport where injuries are common (especially head injuries) is beyond my comprehension. And it should be considered abuse", "Yuupp, my FIL was NFL and doesn't want any of the grandkids playing football. He still suffers physically from concussions etc. I will let my sons choose whether they want to play, but they will be well versed on the possible injuries they may endure. I don't want to hold them back as my dad's parents never let him play any sports growing up. Don't want to go too extreme in either direction.", "People who put their kids in football are foolish too. I\u2019d use a much stronger word but I\u2019ve been threatened by mods with a permanent ban for doing so in the past.", "OMG! The amount of parents who do this is amazing. \n\n I have seen parents think that they are supporting the child but when you ask the child directly what do you want to do the parent cuts in and says HE/SHE is going to go pro/get to the olympics/get a scholarship. \n\nPoor child really wants to be something mundane and play sports for fun. It's OK have dreams but always put the child 1st. What they want, what is best for them, etc.", "That's the strongest disincentive to lying.

I didn't even play in college but played for 10 years and have so many lingering problems as a result even now in my mid-30s. My son is almost 2 and I am not going to push him into football but if he really wants to, I will let him. I plan on having him try out all the sports, and music too, in hopes he finds something he enjoys and is good at though and encouraging him to explore different things. My one hope is that he enjoys golf so that me, him, and my dad can play together just like I did with my dad and granddad though.", "I think that's a really good route. Information is vital to making the best choice for yourself and by having your children choose for themselves it also teaches personal accountability.", "My son wanted to play but that was one sport I said no to. My daughter isn't interested but the answer to that is still no if she wants to try.", "Exactly!", "No, she's standing up for her husband.

YOU may be okay being around assholes who down talk your partner,  but a lot of us don't put up with that shit.

Her response sounded composed and direct, not sure why you\u2019re calling it an outburst.", "Exactly how we want to be as well! I want to encourage them to be well rounded in whatever they like. I loved playing sports, I also sang in choir, and played piano. I feel like when you're young it's the perfect time to explore multiple things to find out what you really enjoy.", "We adopted in our mid 30s and tried not to spoil the kid with things but with opportunities instead. He got bored with the guitar and drums. And athletics although he was good and could have been very good if he wanted but he found racing boring so now his hobby is flying. He's happy and that's all that matters.", "She said what she had to say and that should have been the end of it.", "She stood up for her husband when his own mother was talking shit about him. Creating drama? The MIL started all of this, OP just shut it down by calling them out. Calling out toxic behaviors and attitude isn\u2019t \u201cstarting drama\u201d. \n\nAre you going to hold MIL accountable for her abhorrent attitude towards her son, and vocalizing it in front of his wife? Or should OP just have been a good little DIL and kept her mouth shut? \n\nYeah, MIL can voice her opinion, but so can OP. It works both ways.", "As a grown older sister of a grown younger sister, I could only hope to be like that if somebody was making fun of my sister. That whole scene was just amazing."]}
