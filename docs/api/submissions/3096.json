I played volleyball competitively through high school and was offered several scholarships to play at great schools. I was burnt out and I wanted to focus on my degree. My parents were not ok with me turning down the volleyball scholarships and then my Mom told me I would not get me my college fund (which I know is a privilege on its own) unless I attended state school near her.

Sounds like they never interacted with he kid they had, only the one they thought they had built in their mind.", "NTA, I think it's commendable for you to defend your husband like that. I use a similar method when someone cracks a racist or sexist joke. I tell them I don't understand and ask them to explain, when faced with just how much NOT a joke something is most people feel incredibly uncomfortable and embarrassed, as they should be. This was a case of them being \"jokingly\" salty(but actually petty) and thinking they could get away with it because the person they were \"joking\" about was not present.", "NTA\n\nGood for you for standing up for your husband!\n\nYour husband isn't mad about it; he knows his parents and their tendency to spread disinformation.

Good on you. As an aside though, why would parents push any child towards boxing?", "NTA Good for you blowing up the whole liar's fantasy castle surrounding your husband.  He sounds very successful all by himself.  Good luck and again, good for you.", "NTA.  He is living his life his way which is right.  His mother can just be miserable all she wants.  Not her life.", "NTA - If that is in fact, \"not what MIL meant\" then she should have explained. \n\nIf you'd met your husband in your adult years, I'd say maybe you didn't have all the info. But the fact that you've been together since the age of 14-16, means you know everything you need to know. \n\nPlus if they contacted him to try and fix their relationship, and they're talking like this behind his back, they're probably not trying to fix their relationship as much as they could be. \n\nGood on you for sticking up for him.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
