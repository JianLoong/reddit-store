Like setting the alarm 5 minutes later each week. \n\n-earplugs for you\n\n-if none of this works, you probably aren\u2019t compatible. At this point, You could try a last-ditch effort to make it clear that this is untenable. Start sleeping in a different room. Tell her that it\u2019s threatening the viability of the relationship.

I do something similar, but I wouldn\u2019t subject someone else to that shit.\n\nI set an alarm two hours and one hour before I intend to get up. Occasionally I get up early and enjoy some down time before work. Most of the time I pop a strong mint and go back to sleep - I\u2019ve found this combination to be really good at triggering lucid dreams. I\u2019ve gotten 7 hours and that taste of mint trickles into my dreams and I associate it with that \u201coh, hey, this is a dream\u201d feeling.\n\nShe\u2019s being very inconsiderate with a routine that does nothing but fuck up her sleep.", "NTA this is part of why I\u2019m divorced. He was so selfish. I used to swap between two shifts and when I got up earlier than him I would set the alarm and get up. I would also fry my hair in a different room so I wouldn\u2019t disturb him. When he got up earlier than me the alarm would go off every 6 minutes for an hour before he would actually get out of bed. He would also wake me every night just as I was falling asleep because he wanted a chat or a cuddle. I was permanently exhausted and even sleeping in another room didn\u2019t help because he said he felt less close to me. Ultimately we went compatible", "NTA for sure but I do this. My husband is long gone by the time my 20 alarms go off, but I feel like it wakes me up and I feel like I like to know I get to sleep for another hour and a half? It is super selfish and if I was disrupting my honeys sleep I wouldnt do it. But weirdly enough my daughter does this too. She says she  sleeps so much better knowing she will wake up and know she can sleep a little longer.", "NTA. Quality sleep matters. Partners should respect each other's sleep  cycles. If her way of waking up is inherently  disruptive, spare bed except on your days off.  Or negotiation. At Max an alarm should go off 30min before needed, to give snuggle time.  Alternatively head to bed early to get some connection time if that's  the motivating factor.", "NTA, I was a snoozer too, and adapted it by using a miband that just vibrates on my wrist so I bother nobody", "NTA, My partner does this, sets it half an hour before and has multiple alarms. I don\u2019t need to get up for another hour and a half. I actually enjoy it I part of it is him giving me a 15 minute cuddle every morning and honestly I\u2019d miss it if he stopped now. If it was hours before yeah I wouldn\u2019t be happy.", "NTA. She needs to go to bed earlier.", "NTA. Sleep deprivation is a torture tactic. Don't put up with this for another second!", "NTA. I use \u201csilent alarm for iPhone\u201d as my ringtone and it buzzes my pillow to send me awake. (I\u2019m a light sleeper). I do this because my alarm goes off at 5:08 and my partner\u2019s at 7:15. I do hit snooze once as it takes me a few minutes to wake myself up. I\u2019m usually up and have my watch on before it goes off again. Now on days I don\u2019t work his alarm is nice and loud. I tiptoe around the place and get dressed downstairs. He often turns the light on or uses the ensuite. You should just let people sleep. Interrupted sleep is the worst.", "NTA. She sounds like a human being that completely lacks empathy for other people. Out.", "NTA - this is incredibly inconsiderate of her and I would have absolutely lost my shit long before now.\n\nMy other half used to do this. He no longer does because I wouldn't put up with it. I have enough trouble getting sufficient sleep what with him snuffling away on the other side of the bed like some errant wildebeest without having an unnecessary alarm going off over an hour (in his case) earlier than necessary. \n\nThere is nothing more likely to make someone short tempered than being constantly tired because of nonsense like this.", "All I read was the title. NTA", "NTA, it absolutely pisses me off when my wife does this and I'm now teaching my eldest the proper way \"Set your alarm for the time you want to get up, then when it goes off, get up, because it's better to have 45 mins of continual sleep than to be woken up constantly every 5-10 minutes for an hour!\"\n\nThe best is you then get \"I slept like crap/I'm really tired!\" :D \n\nI found doing it in return on the days she wanted to sleep in kind of got the message across as it doesn't happen that often now.\n\nI'll have an alarm set for 05:45, 05:52, and 06:00 for a 6 a.m. start (I WFH) and I only have 3 in case the first 2 don't wake me. If I'm up at 05:45 the others get turned off before they go off.", "I read that having partners that cause you disturbed sleep is one of the leading factors for break ups so, nta", "NTA, I was in the opposite situation. My gf didn't like the fact that I snoozed so often, it took me a week or so to adapt and I must say that the 20 minutes extra sleep are much better than 20 minutes snoozing.\n\nA practical tip: I use an app called Alarm Clock Extreme, which makes me solve a few maths equations before turning off. You can also scan a barcode of an item you put away from your bed the evening before. There are probably countless alternative apps based on the same principle. Maybe you can suggest doing that?", "Move back out.", "NTA, I had this talk with my partner VERY early into sharing a bed and he immediately had that look of realisation and went \u2018oh wow yeah I can see how it\u2019s actually really inconsiderate, I\u2019m so sorry\u2019. He was too deep in tiredness when his alarm went off to even think of the fact it was waking me up too.\n\nSince then, he\u2019s a one-alarm and up man. It\u2019s always worth talking about and anyone who gives a shit about you and your own tiredness will make the adjustment. Whether that\u2019s setting a more reasonable alarm time instead of an optimistic one and pushing themselves to get up , getting a different type of alarm like a sunrise one, putting their phone across the room so they have to get up to stop it or looking into smartwatches that\u2019ll vibrate on their wrist. There will be an alternative that works for both of you!", "nta, your gf is an idiot", "My personal life experience echoes everything pretty much anything you can find anywhere: if you need an alarm at all, one when you need it is vastly superior to any of the snooze action; she\u2019s getting no actual sleep benefit from it, so I can understand how upsetting it can be for her to be choosing her annoying and ultimately useless (and likely more harmful to her as well) routine over your comfort. NTA", "NTA. My ex used to do this and I had to ask her many times to stop setting her alarms so early since all she did was snooze them for an hour or more. Her reason for doing this was that it helped her wake up. She\u2019d hit snooze and be snoring again within seconds, so I never understood how she was \u201cwaking up.\u201d She finally started setting alarms for 5-10 minutes before she needed to be up, but that took years for that to happen.", "That\u2019s exactly how I do my wake up as well so I\u2019m not going to call her an asshole, but you\u2019re not wrong for being annoyed either and this is probably going to be an ongoing issue so \ud83d\ude2c\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Who wants to wake up an hour earlier than you have to\n\nThat one hour is not sleeping", "NTA. Moving in with another person means adjusting your routine and compromising. Her behaviour isn\u2019t necessary and is causing you problems. It should change.", "NTA. \n\nThis was actually one of the exact reasons that I have such an aversion to moving in with anyone. I had a partner who would do the same exact thing, for two hours straight. The alarm would go off every 30 minutes, so it would go off 4 times before he actually got up. I will say that we ended up compromising in the way that the first alarm would go off and we could spend 30 minutes just cuddling and slowly waking up and then 30 minutes later, he would get up and shower and I'd make us breakfast and his lunch, then 30 minutes later, he would get ready for work and make sure he was all dressed and had his car packed off, and we would spend the last 30 minutes eating together. \n\nI'm someone who doesn't need a lot of sleep to function because I have a sleep disorder. I also have OCPD and when I create a routine, that routine must be followed no matter what. So, for me, our routine was really beneficial for both of us. We both got what we wanted. However, I've had other partners who just smash the alarm and go back to sleep over and over when I'm unable to go back to sleep, so only I'm awake, and that really makes me mad.", "I am also the \"snoozer,\" I set my alarm early because that is the time I would like to be up at but in my sleeping stupor my unconscious brain realizes I probably could get away with sleeping for a little longer.\n\nSolution? Push her out of bed when the alarm goes off the first time and go back to sleep, she won't thank you at first but she'll learn \ud83d\ude02", "NTA.

You'll get a better night's sleep.\n\nWhen she complains, tell her why.\n\nNTA.", "Separate bedrooms? Smartwatch that wakes her with vibration instead of making a sound?

I am **not** a snoozer, period. But I also take an hour+ to actually get up in the morning. People are different in the morning, period. If she needs a long time to get up that's a problem for you, but, that doesn't make her an asshole and it's not any more reasonable to expect her to shift her entire state of being in the morning to a quick riser than it is to expect you to wake up an hour earlier along side her.", "You are not TA, that\u2019s very selfish behavior and also wildly counterproductive, she\u2019s ruining her sleep quality. My husband did the same thing for a long time and I said if he kept doing it I was throwing his phone out the window", "NTA. My partner and I are something of a \"snooze people\" that have to get up at different times quite frequently. We've solved the issue by doing the following: we each have a wristwatch with an alarm function set to vibrations. This way, each person can keep hitting snooze without waking the other up. I was sceptical at first, since I am quite a heavy sleeper, but it really works! Moreover, the buzzing on your wrist is much more relaxed and gentle way of starting the day that phone alarm. I can't recommend it highly enough. You don't have to suffer.", "This. I'm a big snoozer, and I realize how disturbing it is for my partner, so I've just started using a watch that silently wakes me up, problem solved. \nNTA, btw, just good to discuss this and find some solution that would be satisfying for both of you", "My ex used to do that and never had a good reason why he couldn\u2019t just set that 5:30 alarm for 6:20, then snooze 10 mins until 6:30, which is basically what he ended up doing anyway (but with the 5:30 wake up that I could never recover from).\n\nSo selfish and really infuriating for people who value sleep (ie most of us)", "I do this exactly if I set one alarm I do not wake up. I have to make sure I\u2019m woken up an hour before I wake up or I won\u2019t wake up in time to get up because I\u2019m an extreme heavy sleeper. If I don\u2019t set my one hour  in advance alarm and just set my normal alarm I won\u2019t wake up to my normal alarm. There is a sweet spot I have to set an alarm at which is the lightest point of sleep for me to be able to get out of that deep deep slumber it\u2019s crazy but I have to do it it\u2019s the only possible way my body will wake up in the morning. My husband understands. I do have a chronic health issue that causes me to want to sleep more and probably contributes to my heavy sleeping though.", "I\u2019m not a snoozer per se, I never hit snooze, but I prepare 3-5 alarms individually for ever morning because it helps me wake up better that way, always has since I was a kid. I used to have times where I did that for two hours in the morning, but it was always planned the evening before and always before the time I actually had to get up - so I never missed any of the time I should\u2019ve been awake.\n\nThe first alarms I get to go back to dozing off again, making it less terrible to be ripped out of sleep, and by the time I actually have to get up i\u2019m pretty much 80% awake and not taken out of deep sleep anymore. For a while I even went to get breakfast half asleep inbetween alarms and went back to bed for the rest of the alarms.\n\nThought luckily I\u2019m also a very light sleeper, so I can set the alarm on the quietest setting and my ex never once heard it in the 6 years we shared a bed - I don\u2019t think he was even aware I was doing that xD", "My husband and I had a come to Jesus talk about this early on.  I sleep like hell, so if he wakes me up with snoozing, he's getting up too. There will be a parade.  \n\nWe don't set snooze alarms anymore. We get up at the at the first alarm so the other person can sleep their full night. \n\nI'm so glad we don't do multiple snoozes anymore...

Or sometimes he\u2019d just sleep thru multiple alarms he set (obviously when I\u2019m not there to wake him) for no real ostensible reason", "I think he knew his reason but probably felt like a asshole saying it makes him feel good because he's would be basically admitting to being selfish like you say. I really like the feeling of waking up but just being comfortable in bed snoozing for over an hour. Obviously I stopped when i've had partners move in because that's not fair to them. Even living alone when I've got a weird schedule and have to wake up super early I skip the luxury because you need a certain amount of real sleep. It's a luxury.", "There IS no good reason.

My alarms go off at 5:30, 5:32, and 5:34. Not letting myself actually truly snooze between them was the game changer. I've tried everything else, sunlight alarm (wakes up husband), watch vibration alarm (absolutely no way that's waking me up), across the room alarm (takes me too long to get to, wakes up husband). The quick succession of alarms makes it much easier for me to wake up, and my husband barely rouses because it's over so quick.", "> She doesn't need to set her alarm so early. It's a simple adjustment that is of no real consequence for her and brings a lot of happiness for him.\n\nThis is true, but equally true is that he can get up an hour earlier without any real consequences either?", "This is what my partner does. He's a snoozer I'm not. Once I'm awake I'm awake.

I could sleep deep enough to dream in 2 min.", "I also put my alarm clock on the other side of my room. I got a really loud alarm clock so as soon as it starts I panic, get up in a very fast manner and I'm instantly awake.
