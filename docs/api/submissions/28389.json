At 30-something you're still quite young but also set in your ways already so she might not change anymore.", "NTA. Setting her alarm for hours before she needs to wake up, and then snoozing that alarm, is incredibly inconsiderate - not only is she waking herself up each time an alarm goes off but she is also likely waking you up, which is unnecessary. While it\u2019s her choice, how she wakes up, it is inconsiderate of her to be disturbing you each morning.  \nI would recommend talking with your girlfriend about finding a solution together that works for both of you, such as setting an alarm for around 6:00am and waking up for the day then.", "Tell her to get a watch or something. I have an Apple Watch and if I set an alarm on it it\u2019ll vibrate to wake me up but there is no noise so it doesn\u2019t wake up my roommate.", "Nta no. She isn't in her own room anymore.  She's waking you up and that's rude as hell.\n\nMy rule is 'if *I'm* awake bc of your alarm, then *you're* awake'  You wake up? Light goes on, loud ass music is played.", "NTA, and this is coming from a person who used to do exactly that and wake up my 7 roommates in college :\u201d\u201d\u201d) there is genuinely no need to be a morning menace with alarms when you live with someone else. she can 110% adapt to having just one alarm at the time necessary", "This is why my husband and I have separate bedrooms. \n\nBest. Idea. Ever.", "NTA. Sleep is precious and she's stealing yours. There are other ways to get up besides various loud alarms.", "NTA Op.

I have about 10 alarms that start at 4 and go till 5:45 for work. Is it overkill? Probably. Do I know I have a sleeping problem and have tried looking for answers with no results? Yes. Does my alarm disturb anyone else\u2019s sleep? Only my dog because my room is on the opposite side of the house from the other two rooms. Some people do need several alarms to wake up, but if they are disrupting your partners sleep, then you obviously need to think about how you can be respectful to their sleep while still making sure you get up. Your gf needs to figure something out that will work for y\u2019all cause we all desperately need our sleep nowadays", "NTA!! This is THE single most infuriating thing in the world. \n\nI shared a room with someone who set 20 alarms every morning, for every 5 minutes, of increasingly louder and louder sounds (basically a fire truck sound) on the ALEXA. the person could sleep through the apocalypse and still wouldn\u2019t wake up naturally.\n\nI dealt with this for months and all it managed to do was ruin my own sleep sensitivity, and now I can also sleep through an apocalypse. It\u2019s super helpful especially when you have to be up early for work and nothing audible can wake you.", "Make her get the app Alarmy. I'm a total snoozer and it broke the habit.

Everybody wins.", "NTA but sorry man, this is just what living together is going to be. \n\nHave you tried to shift your daily schedule to start at her first alarm? It will mean an early night but I think this might save you from the impoverished sleep and possibly have the secondary effect of annoying/prompting your GF to start the cascade of alarms a little later. You should talk about this and see if you can both agree on a new time to start this process.", "Repeat snoozing is stupid. If you hit snooze from 530  til 630 and then get up, you've robbed yourself of an hour of good quality sleep.", "NTA.

Anyway, not be too hard on her. \n\nSolutions?\n- You could try to keep talking to her about it. You will have to figure out how to deal with conflicts at some point. Be calm. Let her talk. Tell her the impact it\u2019s having on you. Empathize with her too - she\u2019s being asked to change a habit. She might be fearful that she won\u2019t be able to get to work on time. Don\u2019t brush off these concerns. \n- you could offer to get up at 630 with get, and assure her that you won\u2019t let her sleep in. It\u2019s not 7 when you would like to get up, but it\u2019s an improvement. \n\n- you could ask her to wean herself off it. Like setting the alarm 5 minutes later each week. \n\n-earplugs for you\n\n-if none of this works, you probably aren\u2019t compatible. At this point, You could try a last-ditch effort to make it clear that this is untenable. Start sleeping in a different room. Tell her that it\u2019s threatening the viability of the relationship. Reiterate the potential solutions. And give her an ultimatum. \n\nOr you could learn to live with it.

You\u2019re right for how you feel and she\u2019s right for wanting to stick to a routine that works for her.\nI do the snooze thing because I know I have to for me to be on time. I don\u2019t use any alarm sound though just the buzzing so maybe that\u2019s a big difference. But I know that if I don\u2019t do the snooze thing then I\u2019m not gonna want to get out of bed when I actually have to.

This was over the course of a year with me getting pissy because he can fall back asleep super easy, but I don't. Told him it was a deal breaker because I needed my sleep as well, and it was horrifically inconsiderate of him to do that. It did get better over a few years.

It just really takes all that to get him up and awake.   \n\nI found it frustrating until I learned to work around it.   I suffer from narclepsy,  And I wake up the instant there's any kind of noise.  So I am awake as soon as the alarm first goes off.  I'm part of the waking up process for my husband.  I shake him to get his alarm to shut the f*** off.  \n\nI only need an alarm as insurance for in case I don't wake up.  But I usually don't even need an alarm.  I also don't need to be awake,  To get up and get going.  I get out of bed About 20 minutes before my husband gets up.   So his alarm will start going off every minute or 2 from 5 AM.

One solution is your GF sets her alarm back, another could be she (or you if that's easier) moves to the couch to continue snoozing. I understand how several snoozes can feel better than one jarring alarm that you instantly have to get up for.

I have to set multiple alarms to start going off an hour before I'm supposed to get up or I will over sleep. Usually by the 3rd or 4th alarm, I end up actually waking up. My husband uses ear plugs and our agreement is that I will use a different alarm sound than his so he can differentiate his alarm from mine. This makes it easier to ignore and sleep theough. And I only set the alarms in increments of 20 minutes. He says there there is some scientific data that says 20 minutes snooze is the best for waking rested and prevents from getting woken up in the middle of a bad sleep stage. It sounds like that is not the case for her. If she sets an alarm and then is awake the whole time anyway, then that makes her the AH.", "So I suppose it's kind of complicated, personally I do that too, I set alarms 2 hours before I need to be up, sometimes it's so I can read stuff on my phone, sometimes to just lay for a while.

Now he snoozes once or twice and everything is fine. So I\u2019d say that if your partner is considerate and you\u2019re both willing to compromise, it can totally get better.

I'm always extremely exhausted in the morning and have no motivation to get up, so I started setting the first 2-3 alarms as math problems (first one is easy mode, second is slightly harder, third is harder than #2).
