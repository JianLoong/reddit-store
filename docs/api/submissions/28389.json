Like setting the alarm 5 minutes later each week. \n\n-earplugs for you\n\n-if none of this works, you probably aren\u2019t compatible. At this point, You could try a last-ditch effort to make it clear that this is untenable. Start sleeping in a different room. Tell her that it\u2019s threatening the viability of the relationship. Reiterate the potential solutions. And give her an ultimatum. \n\nOr you could learn to live with it.
