He\u2019s being a brat.", "NTA! I can\u2019t believe he yelled at you after you gave him such nice gifts. He should be grateful but instead he yells at you. I would take it all away and make him work back for each and every one of them. He obviously doesn\u2019t see that good things earned.", "NTA\n\nHe expect results without effort.", "NTA.\n\nBut\u2026.. did you tell him your guidelines for receiving a car? Did you tell him he had to earn it? \nOr did you just let him assume he was getting one and behind his back decide that he doesn\u2019t deserve it?", "> Ilove my son but he has done nothing to prove that he deserves a car.\n\nNTA, but you should've communicated that. Waking up on his birthday shouldn't be some reckoning of how well you think he's behaved. His parents should be given out of love, and if you're disappointed in him before that, you should've set expectations then.", "NTA your daughter earned a car.

He has to get a job while you offer a downpayment for her house after she gets her degree? She gets a pony for her 25'th birthday but he only gets a bike since he's just working at McDonalds?\n\nIf you keep going down this path, your son might very well end up resenting you, and at 18 years old this is the man and the situation you created and you will have nobody else to blame for the outcome in the end.", "YTA, But not for refusing to buy him a car. He sounds spoiled and bratty. Perhaps I'm being unfair, but I wonder if you're too indulgent with him.", "ESH.  Yes, your son is being a spoiled whiny brat, but I don't think that's the whole picture here. Have you actually communicated with your son like...at all, or are you just throwing shit at the wall and trying to see what sticks? Have you actually sat down and asked him what HE wants, or are you pushing him relentlessly toward something YOU want FOR him? Not everyone excels at academics.  I know this wasn't the answer you were wanting, but if you keep pushing him toward something he doesn't want while simultaneously punishing him for not fulfilling you're goals hes going to resent you.", "ESH.\n\nHe's being an entitled, petulant monster.\n\nYou're playing favorites and demonstrating that your love is conditional and transactional.", "ESH. Only because college isn't for everyone and you are putting that expectation on him. It's clearly unrealistic given his grades. Perhaps it's time to stop with college talk and discuss trade schools. Opportunities are there. He just needs to know there are other options.\n\nHe also sounds quite spoiled. Why do you keep getting him all these expensive items when he isn't doing bare minimum expectations like getting a C average? It sounds like he has never really had consequences for poor grades, just excuses made.", "YTA.  Wow what a buch of BS.  So did it ever occur to you, that maybe your soon doesn't do well with academis? Maybe he is a tradesman or craftsman, have ever talked with him about it?  I get it you must be a book worm with no common sense.  Ill break it to you Mr..  Your failing as a father, can you tell your colleagues and coworkers about this?  If so would they judge you like i am?  Listen sit down with your boy and have the real talk with him.  If not he will hold true resentment against you and start to go LC.  As a father myself, it is your job to provide the teachings and understanding to your family.  You sir need therapy, do it now before your boy goes NC.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
