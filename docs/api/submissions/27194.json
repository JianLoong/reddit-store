I asked my mother when she is coming back she told me today in the morning but she didn\u2019t come so in the morning when she didn\u2019t arrive, i asked my mom again when she would come she told me by 4 pm. I said ok and then i started doing by office work. \n\nThen i went to the gym and i came back around 6pm thinking that she would be home as i need to leave in an hour or so but when i came back my car still wasn\u2019t here. I lost my temper completely. I called my sister to ask what\u2019s the matter why haven\u2019t you came yet? she told me she is n\u1ecdt coming, i told her i have an important match and my kit is in the car i need it urgently, she said you manage i am not coming and hang up on me. I then called her severely times but she didn\u2019t pick it up. I then called my elder sister and i asked her to let me talk with her so she gave her the phone and completely shouted at her telling that i would never let you touch my car again and lot of things that I shouldn\u2019t have said at that time and i shouted at my mother too for passing me the false information and keep giving me false hope. \n\nI said lot of words that I shouldn\u2019t be saying and \u00ed created a scene at home. Now my sister came to know about this that i am creating a scene at home and shouting so she is now she is coming back, crying! Maybe I spoiled her night too and now i am waiting for her but it\u2019s already too late I won\u2019t be able to make it my match and I\u2019m probably fucked because i will be getting kicked out of the team.
