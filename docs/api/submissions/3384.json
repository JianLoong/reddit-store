Last Christmas she started advertising this snowflake design, replicated from this other maker and claiming it as her own design. It became really popular and her SM account blew up. The local small business community really hyped up these ornaments and she kept selling out, with everyone saying how gorgeous her ornament is. I said nothing, it\u2019s her life, let her get on with it. So this year, same thing, she started advertising them about a month ago. Just to be clear - she definitely copied the design.

You probably should have credited the original designer up front, but anyone who gets angry that you copied Leah? \"I didn't copy Leah, I saw that design *years* ago on original creators social media. I copied *them*. And since Leah follows original creator, I suspect she did, too. Except I'm not *profiting* off someone elses work\".\n\nAnd Leah can go step on a lego. The creator community can be small, and it can be mean. Hopefully this is her comeuppance.", "Lmao Nta. It looks like she copied and didn\u2019t credit because she copied and didn\u2019t credit", "NTA, but also I personally don't think there's a problem with what Leah's doing on the condition that she didn't use the original designer's pattern. If she saw their product and reverse engineered it, then I can't see the issue with that."]}
