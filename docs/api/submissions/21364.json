There is no sitting on the fence about this - it should have altered their relationship with her significantly and I get that as parents they would not sever their relationship with her her - but by your mother asking where her invite was - it genuinely seems they chose her in this and they accepted what she did to you.

And on your wedding day - when you've got so much trauma about it?\n\nI'd reply to your mother in strict terms that  (your sisters name) chose to end your relationship and chose not to be your sister when she had an affair with your fiance and that there will never be a day whilst you are alive where you will want to see or hear her or be in the same room as her. Dont justify it beyond that. If she argues back then say it seems they have chosen her over you if they cant accept your right not to be anywhere near her - and that she (your mother)has the free will to choose not to come if she finds your boundary unacceptable.
