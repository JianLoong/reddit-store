It\u2019s because she f*cked your fianc\u00e9 behind your back. Of course the relationship is already ruined.

You might also have your mother relay a message that an apology is just words, what will she actually do to show remorse and regain your trust and love.

In fact its insane that she thinks you might.  \nPersonally I would have immediately and permanently cut her out of my life  \nAbsolutely do not let her attend.", "NTA. I am so sorry OP. And no, this was not a 'childish feud', your sister CHEATED ON YOU with your ex-fianc\u00e9 and completely destroyed your relationship through betrayal. Forgiveness is a choice, not a necessity. Consider this experience to be a blessing in disguise, you dodged a bullet. You and your fianc\u00e9 should hire a bodyguard to make sure that your sister is not in attendance; it's your wedding and your rules. You tell your mother very clearly that she will either respect your decision or she will not be invited either. Congratulations!", "NTA.

Hope your wedding goes smoothly and all is well.", "Nta she throws your relationship to garbage when she slept with your ex. if there anyone she can blame it herself three years ago .

You don't have to invite anyone you don't feel wishes the best for you.", "NTA - Clearly not.\n\nIf your parents embraced what occurred as fact there is nothing for them to 'deal with'. Acceptance is all they need to do: Accept reality, your boundaries, and politely tell their other daughter to stop revisiting the topic with them and you.\n\nI am astonished your mom asked about  your sibling's invite. You're not asking them to go NC with her you are minimally asking they value and honor your boundary. You are creating a new life chapter and deserve the focus to be on this and not a second spent catering to your sister; in any way.
