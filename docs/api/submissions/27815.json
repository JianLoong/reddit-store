We both suffer from chronic illness/disabilities that made it difficult to work, and were both trying to figure out how to have a decent life being poor and disabled.\n\nBecause of my medical issues, I can't drive, so I struggled  for years, but recently found a low paying full-time job I could thrive in without it triggering so many of my stress-induced seizures.\n\nAlly, on the other hand, is able to drive and is able to do desk work. Over the past five years, I watched her quit job after job. It was always reasons like 'the boss is bitchy' or 'it's giving me panic attacks' or 'the commute is too hard' or something else. Ally constantly complains about money, told me her landlord was 'on her ass', and has debt collectors after her. \n\nRecently, she messaged me to ask if I thought she would be a 'bad person' for doing something sketchy. I asked her what the bad thing was. \n\nShe told me that she'd recently watched her friend's teen daughter for a few days, and the mom had given Ally the child's foodstamp card so they could get some food for the next few days. Well, Ally 'forgot to give it back.' She asked if I thought it was okay if she ***stole the foodstamp card to use for herself.*** \n\nI was really taken aback. Ally explained that the foodstamp card was from the child's father, and that the child 'didn't seem to be going hungry when she was with her dad,' and that the dad probably would never notice it was missing. But Ally, of course, was having money problems, and said she needed food.\n\nI felt totally disgusted, and suddenly angry at the entire 'storyline' she's brewed for herself of being a poor, chronically ill woman who just can't seem to catch a break. I told her she needed to give the foodstamp card back to the child. Since then, she's asked me to hang out twice, and both times I said no. \n\nThen she posted something about feeling 'rejection sensitivity', and a bunch of people swarmed the comments to tell her how valued and loved she was. \n\nAITA for cutting this friendship off because my fellow disabled friend thought about stealing a child's foodstamp card? I get all of us disabled people struggle, but this really bothered me. \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1695916160, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ujkhb/aita_for_declining_to_spend_time_with_fellow/", "score": 68, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
