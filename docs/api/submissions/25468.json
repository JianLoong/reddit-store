And being the easily pissed off person I am said \u201ccan I finally talk now?\u201d To which she responded \u201cwe\u2019ll all get a chance to talk\u201d and instead of dropping it and telling my story I went \u201cso you can get pissed off when people interrupt you but I can\u2019t when I get interrupted?\u201d She responded \u201cI don\u2019t though\u201d and we went back and forth until I left the table and went to the sofa. \nLater that night we were all doing our own thing and me and SB got into a minor argument over who ate all the cookies and I sat down and said \u201coh don\u2019t make me start\u201d and SM who was not previously involved with the argument said \u201coh please do\u201d and as I already stated I am an easily pissed off person and I will be the first to admit that if you didn\u2019t hear my said of the story it would definitely be considered toxic.

She was also married at the time and used me SB having a close age as an excuse saying me and SB we\u2019re having a play date while they were actually hooking up.  My SS was the one who found the messages and showed them to her dad. SM then went on to ignore her for over a month. SB was still a child at the time.\n\nMy dad found out yesterday that I know the he was cheating.\n\nSM is an extremely skinny woman as she has very fast metabolism and thinks that gives her a right to comment on my physical appearance on things such as:\nMy hair (I dye it a lot)\nMy weight (even though I\u2019m under weight and she knows I struggle with eating)\nMy clothing choice (if it\u2019s not her style or wouldn\u2019t look good on her she says it\u2019s unholy and I should change)\n\n(One more thing I want to add is on the first night SM and my dad got into an argument, my dad and I went to get food as we had none and when we got to M&S my dad saw he has 23missed called and 56 texts all from SM and as SS was really ill at the time we were worried and he called my SM and she just said she needed the car keys and she was going home (8hrs away from where we were on holiday) and I was talking to SS about this and she said that SM didn\u2019t tell either of them and her plan was to just leave SB and SS there with no car)", "created_utc": 1692960464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160vq4r/aita_for_not_apologising_to_my_step_mum/", "score": 145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Good luck, it's a tough road.", "NTA\n\nI\u00b4m sorry kid, I have been in your shoes albeit later in life. Me an my brothers were just coming of age when my parents divorced and our dad also cheated on our mum with another woman and they are now happily married. Despite some of us already on the verge of going to college, it shook our foundations and it fucked us beyond believe. My youngest brother was 16 and he was hit the hardest, so if you were 7 when it happened, it must have impacted your life in such an impactful way I can fully understand the issues it has given you.\n\nMy parents and step-parents do not take any responsibility in the fucked-upness they left our family in, and of course all problems we now have forming healthy and mature relationships are anything but their fault.\n\nBoth your dad and your stepmother need to take ownership of the shit they created and the mess they left you in. You are in a family that isn\u00b4t yours, as hard as they try, your family as you felt it is gone. The way you are struggling in life, the way you are trying to find a place in a family that doesn\u00b4t feel yours, at the age you are at, I am fairly certain to say it is a direct result of their cheating. To have a new step mother that openly said she does not like you doesn\u00b4t help at all.\n\nFor peace in the house it is advisable to apologise, but I don\u00b4t think you need to. Your dad should have stuck up for you and should have owned up for what he is responsible for.\n\nObviously not all interactions are their fault, and it for sure doesn\u00b4t give you a blank check to just do as you please, but by how you described it, they are not helping you at all to feel included in your family.\n\nI am really sorry to hear the position you are in, life will be tough. There might be sub for children of divorced parents that can be helpful, because like most of us, you will be dealing with this for a long time. Good luck, and please don\u00b4t forget that your father is also only human, looking to connect and feel loved. He isn\u00b4t your enemy, but sometimes it does feel like he isn\u00b4t your ally, just remember he loves you to but like any human, he will make some bad decisions too!", "Your step \"\"parent\"\" is a homewrecker and should be ashamed. NTA - never apologize.", "I am sorry you struggle with both your family situation and your mental health. You are definitly NTA. But you should still apologize, because in the end that is the more constructive thing to do and most likely your SM is at best one of many reasons for the end of your parents' marriage. She is just the most obvious from your perspective.", "I think you shouldn't be measured by normal standards in that case, so NTA. You know you have a short fuse and yelling at her wasn't too smart. But I can so totally relate and your stepfamily isn't helping at all.\n\nI can imagine that sitting down with your dad and stepmom and everybody apologizes at each other might be a good way ahead.\n\nI wish you all the best for your way forward in life. Take care.", "ESH. Being easily pissed off doesn\u2019t mean you get to act on it. She should have apologized for interrupting you, but when you finally got what you wanted- a chance to tell your story- and instead of doing that, you argued over whether you\u2019re allowed to be angry and stalked off.

Doesn\u2019t that phrase mean I am at my tipping point, back up so I can calm down? Because to me she triggered you on purpose, expecting a freakout and then she is validated when she says how terrible you are. If you apologize you will reinforce the idea that you were in the wrong, you weren\u2019t. If your mum was supportive, you could demand apology for triggering you when you said enough. But that would not be easy without your mum\u2019s support. You do deserve an apology from her though. \n\nI agree you need to control this, but not for other people. For you.

Might be for appearances, might be because we are done with drama and we just want to have a nice time together, even by ignoring the elephants in the room.   \n\n\nIt\u00b4s like a broken vase glued back together, the cracks will always be visible. But if you squint your eyes, and with some nice flowers, it can still be a pretty sight. Try not to focus too much on the cracks, and squinting your eyes might be the only way you can sometimes really enjoy the sight.

The person who has the biggest responsibility is the one breaking their wows.\n\nNow, for her comments: have you talked to your parents and therapist?
