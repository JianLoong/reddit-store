Yesterday we went surfing and we\u2019re all talking about the different stupid ways we fell off. I kept trying to say my but SS and SB kept interrupting me and my dad finally intervened when SM interrupted me. And being the easily pissed off person I am said \u201ccan I finally talk now?\u201d To which she responded \u201cwe\u2019ll all get a chance to talk\u201d and instead of dropping it and telling my story I went \u201cso you can get pissed off when people interrupt you but I can\u2019t when I get interrupted?\u201d She responded \u201cI don\u2019t though\u201d and we went back and forth until I left the table and went to the sofa. \nLater that night we were all doing our own thing and me and SB got into a minor argument over who ate all the cookies and I sat down and said \u201coh don\u2019t make me start\u201d and SM who was not previously involved with the argument said \u201coh please do\u201d and as I already stated I am an easily pissed off person and I will be the first to admit that if you didn\u2019t hear my said of the story it would definitely be considered toxic. Anyway I yelled back \u201cOH I WILL\u201d got up pointed to her and screamed \u201cYOU\u2019RE THE REASON I DON\u2019T HAVE A FUCKING FAMILY.\u201d and stormed off to the hall way slamming the door. Before anyone jumps to tell me I\u2019m wrong near me out. SM knows that I have been in and out of therapy for about 7 years (so since I was 7-8) and that I struggle with my mental and physical health and I have heard her saying that she dose not like me at all,and I know she is the reason my parents got divorced as my dad was cheating on my mum with SM. And I just started balling my eyes out as it\u2019s the holidays and I haven\u2019t been able to see my therapist for about 3 weeks now. My dad and I went out for walk and then came back and we all went to sleep. And now my dad is sat next to me trying to make apologise to her but I refuse. AITA?\n\n\nThis is a bit of a change: \nFor some more info my SM did know about my mum and I. She was also married at the time and used me SB having a close age as an excuse saying me and SB we\u2019re having a play date while they were actually hooking up.  My SS was the one who found the messages and showed them to her dad. SM then went on to ignore her for over a month. SB was still a child at the time.\n\nMy dad found out yesterday that I know the he was cheating.\n\nSM is an extremely skinny woman as she has very fast metabolism and thinks that gives her a right to comment on my physical appearance on things such as:\nMy hair (I dye it a lot)\nMy weight (even though I\u2019m under weight and she knows I struggle with eating)\nMy clothing choice (if it\u2019s not her style or wouldn\u2019t look good on her she says it\u2019s unholy and I should change)", "created_utc": 1692960464, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160vq4r/aita_for_not_apologising_to_my_step_mum/", "score": 77, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your step mum is awful and you don't owe her an apology. But you should try to calm down and find better ways to deal with your anger. And you should talk to your dad about how you feel and how he can help you.", "NTA although I think thing could be done with little more tact, step family really don't seem to value you or what you have to say.  Good luck, it's a tough road.", "NTA\n\nI\u00b4m sorry kid, I have been in your shoes albeit later in life. Me an my brothers were just coming of age when my parents divorced and our dad also cheated on our mum with another woman and they are now happily married. Despite some of us already on the verge of going to college, it shook our foundations and it fucked us beyond believe. My youngest brother was 16 and he was hit the hardest, so if you were 7 when it happened, it must have impacted your life in such an impactful way I can fully understand the issues it has given you.\n\nMy parents and step-parents do not take any responsibility in the fucked-upness they left our family in, and of course all problems we now have forming healthy and mature relationships are anything but their fault.\n\nBoth your dad and your stepmother need to take ownership of the shit they created and the mess they left you in. You are in a family that isn\u00b4t yours, as hard as they try, your family as you felt it is gone. The way you are struggling in life, the way you are trying to find a place in a family that doesn\u00b4t feel yours, at the age you are at, I am fairly certain to say it is a direct result of their cheating. To have a new step mother that openly said she does not like you doesn\u00b4t help at all.\n\nFor peace in the house it is advisable to apologise, but I don\u00b4t think you need to. Your dad should have stuck up for you and should have owned up for what he is responsible for.\n\nObviously not all interactions are their fault, and it for sure doesn\u00b4t give you a blank check to just do as you please, but by how you described it, they are not helping you at all to feel included in your family.\n\nI am really sorry to hear the position you are in, life will be tough. There might be sub for children of divorced parents that can be helpful, because like most of us, you will be dealing with this for a long time. Good luck, and please don\u00b4t forget that your father is also only human, looking to connect and feel loved. He isn\u00b4t your enemy, but sometimes it does feel like he isn\u00b4t your ally, just remember he loves you to but like any human, he will make some bad decisions too!", "Your step \"\"parent\"\" is a homewrecker and should be ashamed. NTA - never apologize.", "I am sorry you struggle with both your family situation and your mental health. You are definitly NTA. But you should still apologize, because in the end that is the more constructive thing to do and most likely your SM is at best one of many reasons for the end of your parents' marriage. She is just the most obvious from your perspective.", "I think you shouldn't be measured by normal standards in that case, so NTA. You know you have a short fuse and yelling at her wasn't too smart. But I can so totally relate and your stepfamily isn't helping at all.\n\nI can imagine that sitting down with your dad and stepmom and everybody apologizes at each other might be a good way ahead.\n\nI wish you all the best for your way forward in life. Take care.", "ESH. Being easily pissed off doesn\u2019t mean you get to act on it. She should have apologized for interrupting you, but when you finally got what you wanted- a chance to tell your story- and instead of doing that, you argued over whether you\u2019re allowed to be angry and stalked off. And she should have stayed out of the argument with your stepbrother, but what you said crossed the line. Your dad was responsible for his decision to cheat, not her.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That said SM is also NTA.", "NTA and you should try to limit your stay with your stepfamily and have one on one with your dad", "NTA what you are is a child who is in an unpleasant situation with adults who should be trying to help and aren\u2019t. I hope you get to go home to your mom soon.", "NTA. Have you talk to your dad? Have you tell him that you hear her say that? Does he know that you know that he cheat? Do your step sibling know their mom was the other woman? Ask your therapist if can do online, that will help when you are far and cant go in person.", "I am planning to apologise but I should be seeing my therapist again soon so I will ask her for more advice with more details I didn\u2019t share in the story", "Thank you for your support", "Thank you for the help I am planning to apologise for the shouting and for making a scene but I will apologise for what I said when she also does", "I feel I may apologise to her for shouting but not for what I said as she has said worse about me to my dad but also my face", "Thank you for your help and I am planning to apologise for yelling but I will apologise for what I said when she does as well", "Thank you for the advice but she was also aware of the marriage and was married herself and used me and SB being the same age as an excuse saying it was a play date. I have plans to apologise for yelling but not for what I said. I will apologise for what I said when she apologises for thing she has said about be regarding the way I look and dress as well as my weight", "Thank you though she was aware of the marriage and she was married herself when they were \u201ctogether\u201d", "Thank you for the advice lucky I stay with my mum more", "Thank you I will be with my mum tomorrow", "My dad only found out yesterday that I knew and SB doesn\u2019t SS does as she was cheating whilst married to their farther and SS is the one who showed him the messages and I do tell him I know what SM says as they break up every other week", "Don\u2019t apologize. What kind of an adult says \u201cplease do\u201d to a kid after the kid is saying \u201cdon\u2019t make me start\u201d? Doesn\u2019t that phrase mean I am at my tipping point, back up so I can calm down? Because to me she triggered you on purpose, expecting a freakout and then she is validated when she says how terrible you are. If you apologize you will reinforce the idea that you were in the wrong, you weren\u2019t. If your mum was supportive, you could demand apology for triggering you when you said enough. But that would not be easy without your mum\u2019s support. You do deserve an apology from her though. \n\nI agree you need to control this, but not for other people. For you. When you get triggered you are the one feeling bad emotions and getting the backlash even if your emotions are justified. Learning to control will improve your life, maybe even confidence.", "You think you must apologize because you said something in anger. Just because you were angry doesn\u2019t mean you lied. You said a fact\u2026 a fact your Dad doesn\u2019t want to hear because it makes him an ah for cheating. \n\nBut you need some technics to control your anger. Talk with your mom soon", "That\u00b4s a good decision.  \n\n\nIt\u00b4s been 18 years since the cheating, family Christmas is still awkward and at times difficult. We are 5 kids in total, 2 with serious psychological issues, 2 with minor but significant commitment issues, and 1 seemingly alright. We avoid certain topics, we keep the peace. Might be for appearances, might be because we are done with drama and we just want to have a nice time together, even by ignoring the elephants in the room.   \n\n\nIt\u00b4s like a broken vase glued back together, the cracks will always be visible. But if you squint your eyes, and with some nice flowers, it can still be a pretty sight. Try not to focus too much on the cracks, and squinting your eyes might be the only way you can sometimes really enjoy the sight. It\u00b4s a form of denial, I know, but at your age, you can\u00b4t really be better off without them.   \n\n\nTake care and good luck!", "If that is a solution you feel comfortable with, it sounds good to me. If she is a halfway decent person, I hope she would reciprocate and apologize for some of her actions as well.", "Sounds like a good starting point. I got furious as well as a child, when I got interrupted and I still despise it. It is so stupid and respectless.\n\nBut you know, you will be stuck together for the next few years, so it might be a good idea to find at least some basic accord.", "Thanks you for the support as most people in the house think i am in the wrong", "Thank you I should be going to see my therapist soon", "I hope your therapist is good because this has to be very hard to deal with. And how about your mum?", "My mums alright though we are polar opposites and can get pissy if I don\u2019t like a food and ect other than that she\u2019s good", "No judgement. But your taking your anger out on the wrong person. Your dad is 100% at fault for cheating. \n\nYes, she knew and was cheating herself. Unleashing your anger on her is probably easier than confronting that it\u2019s your dad who owed his faithfulness to you and your mom. It\u2019s your dads choices that have changed your family. It\u2019s YOUR DAD who betrayed your established family. That\u2019ll be hard to differentiate at your age. Hopefully your therapist can help you identify the root of your anger because while your SM was wrong to be part of an affair - she didn\u2019t owe you or your mom anything. \n\nTough pill to swallow but she isn\u2019t the reason you \u201cdon\u2019t have a fucking family\u201d - YOUR DAD IS.", "Oh dear. No judgment here, as that won't help. This sounds less like a conflict with your SM and more like you finding life difficult right now. What a hard situation for you to be in, with a stepmother who came into your life under such circumstances.  Do you see your mum much? Can you go stay with her or grandparents or friends for a few days?\n\nI think you need to apologise for speaking in anger. One should never say such things in anger. Perhaps you need a little more practice at walking away.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSee if you can live more with mom and less with these abusive AHs.", "Nta. Apologize, but when you are able leave and have no contact with them.", "Thanks for the help and I tend to live with my mum more than my dad", "I think what Inevitable-Place was trying to say is that while she's in the wrong for cheating, she's responsible for the destruction of *her* marriage and original family unit, because she owed her loyalty to them. Your father on the other hand owed loyalty to you and your mother. The person who has the biggest responsibility is the one breaking their wows.\n\nNow, for her comments: have you talked to your parents and therapist? She's so out of line for them, and it's not healthy to be around someone who's purposefully tearing you down. You and your parents need to look out for your mental health.", "Im glad to hear that. Good luck!", "Lego Technics are pretty cool and versatile, but I don't think they help anger issues", "Don't apologize. They just don't like to hear the truth. Cheaters lie to themselves the most. \n\nNTA. Also, trust me, cheaters cheat, their relationship will not last."]}
