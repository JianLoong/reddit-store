Please be kind because I\u2019m sort of fuming but also trying to calm myself by typing this out for internet strangers. \n\nOkay so - long story short, my boyfriend and I live in a major city with a restaurant that has three Michelin stars. It\u2019s so outside our price range that we\u2019ve only ever talked about it in fantastical terms, kind of like the way you\u2019d talk about what you\u2019d do if you were Marie Antoinette at Palais Versailles. Well, lo and behold, as part of my annual bonus, my firm (which is quite small and intimate - they market themselves as a \u201cboutique\u201d specializing in their service expertise) knew I was a big foodie and somehow managed to get me not only reservations to this amazing restaurant but also gave me a $500 gift card to accompany it. \n\nNaturally, I lost my shit. This was the coolest gift ever, even if I would\u2019ve preferred a more generous cash bonus and/or raise, but I also knew I did not have the necessary clout to get a reservation at this particular restaurant, let alone one in the first half of 2023. \n\nSo anyway, the story goes that I obviously intended to bring my boyfriend. However, he\u2019s not a big foodie, and never has been. One of my girlfriends knew this, and not so subtly implied that I should take her in his stead. I asked my boyfriend about this, and him, being the sweet, empathetic boy that he is, was more than willing to give up his seat in lieu of my friend, who arguably is the much bigger foodie than either of us and would\u2019ve probably appreciated the experience more than my boyfriend or I. \n\nYet, I felt super uncomfortable with this and told my friend I would prefer going with my boyfriend to the date. This is a decision that I now regret and which prompted me to write to internet strangers, because she has since accused me of being naive, ignorant, wasteful (because such a dining experience should not be wasted on those who would not have understood the difference like she would\u2019ve), and most hurtful of all, a bad friend. \n\nTo be fair to her, she has always had a passion for food and good restaurants. She has her own food blog which she has diligently posted to since our college days and maintains to this day. I am definitely more of a casual observer of good food, and appreciate the same, as someone who works for a firm that often wines and dines its clients in upper echelon restaurants. She is right, however, when she claims that my boyfriend and I would not be able to tell the difference between a one Michelin starred restaurant versus a three Michelin starred restaurant. Because we probably wouldn\u2019t. \n\nAnyway, I ended up just letting her have the reservation slot and I kept the $500 gift card to potentially use myself or give to someone else with a reservation there, but my boyfriend has kept voicing his disappointment that I\u2019m an idiot and a doormat. Moreover, I feel bad that I promised him a fancy dinner at this three Michelin starred restaurant and then rescinded the offer to give to someone else. \n\nSo, please.

I understand your boyfriend, i dont think his issue is because you promised him a nice dinner there but you suddenly took it back. Like you said, he was more than willing to give it up. I think his problem is because you let yourself be walked over by your friend. You wanted to go there. You have been wanting to go there for a long time. You wanted to go wih your boyfriend. It was your bonus. Not hers. Yours. The michelin restaurant wouldnt give AF if the person eating in their place is a foodie or not. Your friend has NO right to demand that you go with her instead. She has no right to insist that she deserves to go there more than your boyfriend either. The reservation was yours, not hers. She should have shut up the moment she said you didnt wanna go with her.\n\nMichelin restaurants may be an upscale experience, but it doesnt alwyas have to technical. It can just be a couple eating out together in this nice restaurant regardless if you understand how different it is from others.\n\nNow, you have let go of that opportunity and gave it to someone who only didnt deserve it, but was also insulting to your boyfriend. You have also completely changed that friendship dynamic. Now your friend knows she can push you around to get what she wants and you will give in.", "YTA to yourself and your company who went out of this way to treat you. You are a doormat and your friend is a jerk.", "YTA and a doormat.", "Guuuuurl wtf LOL. Why the eff did you give this prized reservation to someone who spoke condescendingly and rudely to you? Friends do not call each other \"naive, ignorant, [and] wasteful\" - let alone over something like this. It was perfectly natural you wanted to share this special experience with your boyfriend...just because he's not a foodie doesn't mean he can't appreciate good food! Furthermore, this was a reward for YOUR hardwork and no one else gets to dictate or judge how you use it.\n\nYour boyfriend is right - you were a doormat and your \"friend\" was trying to use you from the start because she needed this dining experience to add to her food blog. You are NTA, but your friend is and please kick her to the curb. I hope you can get a reservation there in the future so that you can enjoy the dining experience with whomever you choose.", "YTA to yourself\n\nYour friend is a bigger one.\n\nSo your boss went out of their way to get you reservations to a restaurant and you just gave it away?  You let your friend talk you out of your reservation because she says she is a foodie and she has a food blog.\n\nYour friend probably made an idiot of herself getting instagram shots of her food to post.", "YTA. You let your friend guilt trip you out of your bonus. She felt comfortable enough to treat you that way but you also didn\u2019t put your foot down and tell her to back off. Who cares that she\u2019s a \u201cfoodie\u201d. She didn\u2019t work for that reward. Boot your lil friend. She\u2019s an AH too.", "Not sure you are. I think I agree with your BF. Your friend, however is a massive asshole, and not really a friend.", "ESH, your friend for being manipulative and a bully; and you for letting her manipulate and bully you\n\nYour BF is ok though", "YTA - why did you give up something that is so important to you that your colleagues went to a great deal of trouble to. obtain just for you?  I\u2019m sure that will leave a bad taste in their mouth.\nYou should have used their gift for yourself. You robbed yourself and your boyfriend of a once in a lifetime experience.\n\nYou are wrong that you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference in a one-star vs three-star restaurant. It\u2019s an absurd argument.\n\nYour friend is not great for pressuring you but you gave a away a gift that people got just for you.", "YTA to yourself. And yes sorry but you are an absolutely doormat. Your friend was being an asshole here. Who cares if you aren't used to find dining like that. Go have a great time and a fun date with your bf but you let your friend walk all over you and have it up. Do yourself a favour and realise that they are not a friend and drop them.", "I don\u2019t think YTA I think OP friend is. It\u2019s your bonus and she\u2019s essentially emotionally badgered you into caving and giving her the booking. The question isn\u2019t if YTA- true question is why you can\u2019t negotiate conflict like this and cave with a shitty friend makes you feel bad and gets your bonus. It would have been a lovely dinner for you and your partner regardless of whether you are foodies or not. NTA but develop some assertive communication skills with your friend.", "NTA. Your friend is. Anyone with half a brain would know you would want to do this with your boyfriend. If girlfriend wants to go there so much well she needs to pay. Also she needs to get off her high horse, doesn\u2019t matter if you a very unique type of palette it\u2019s about enjoying the experience and the time with your partner. She honestly sounds like an awful friend, one who is jealous that your work has given you an awesome bonus and a reservation slot. \n\nYou are an idiot though for giving her the reservation slot. I mean seriously. This had her walking all over you. You need to learn to stand up for yourself here. You allowed someone to make you feel that you didn\u2019t have a right to go somewhere nice, especially when your work has gone to the effort in securing the slot for you. Dump this friend.", "NTA, good friends aren't jealous.\n\nHer being a \"self proclaimed expert\" or foodie doesn't grant her any privileges on YOUR gifts, that YOU received, from YOUR job.\n\nShe tried to manipulate you, she failed, and now she tries to guilt trip you.\n\nThis person isn't your friend.\n\nps: oh and i forgot to add, you're too guillable.\n\nEdit: i just realized that i had missed the last sentence about you giving her the reservation, your bf is right on that point you really acted like a doormat and should serisously reconsider your relationship with your \"friend\".", "INFO: I don\u2019t really see the conflict here. It sounds like ur friend just sucks and is the AH. It\u2019s not their bonus, and they shouldn\u2019t have a say on who deserves it more when they didn\u2019t earn it to begin with. I\u2019m a little muddy on details tho. How far in advance did u tell ur bf u were going?", "NTA. Your initial reaction of going with your boyfriend was spot on. There's more to eating fine meals than the menu. It includes the people you eat them with. Sharing this one with your boyfriend would have given you memories of a shared experience beyond the cell phone pictures of the food on the plates.  It would have given you memories of conversation with someone who, presumably, you are close with.\n\nUnfortunately, you were bullied by a fellow foodie. What's more, you gave away a chunk of your bonus as a result of her success.", "NTA, and that is not your friend. I would definitely limit how much I speak to them (if at all).\n\nI\u2019m also petty and would call and either cancel or change the reservation and take my partner.", "Nta, but your friend is. First she convinces you to give up going with your bf. And then she calls it wasted on your bf and you? Please! \nYour bf is right, you shouldn\u2019t have given her the reservation. Is there any way to get it back? \nYou and your bf deserve a nice meal together that you can always cherish in your memory. \n\nYou have to set boundaries with your friends. I know that\u2019s hard bc that often means loneliness, but that\u2019s better than friends like that.", "Hmmm NTA but your foodie friend is a major one!! If she wanted to go so bad why didn't she try for her own reservation? You and your bf could've had an amazing experience at some fancy romantic restaurant and honestly who cares if you can't tell the difference between a 1 or 3 star Michelin. It would've been fun for the 2 of you and not wasteful AT ALL. Instead your friend whined, moaned and insulted the both of you to get what SHE wanted smh. She is not a friend... she only thinks of herself.", "NTA. You are, however, a bit of a fool for passing up the dinner. . \n\nYou should have taken your friend. It's not disloyal to the boyfriend to take her to something he wouldn't dig as much.\n\nAND it's wonderful that the boss would give you a bonus so right in your wheelhouse.", "In general , NTA. But you shouldn\u2019t have allowed your so-called friend to bully you.\n\nFine food/dining is not reserved for \u201cfoodies\u201d, it\u2019s for anyone who wants to and can afford to have it. \n\nSo what if you wouldn\u2019t recognize all the nuances she thinks she would ? I\u2019ve drunk plenty of expensive wine over the years but can\u2019t pick out the flavors connoisseurs can, but I still enjoy the wine.\n\nSee if there\u2019s some way you can either get the reservation back, by hook or crook, or if you can, wrangle another somehow at another time even if it\u2019s ages away.", "NTA. Good grief. Your so called friend is anything but. She's an entitled bully that doesn't deserve your friendship. Your boyfriend is right. Don't be a doormat. Tell your friend to go and fuck herself, rescind the offer and take your BF out for a lovely meal. You'll regret it if you don't.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This whole foodie thing is a load of crap.  You can enjoy food without being a \"foodie\".  I'm sure you can tell a difference between a 5 star steak and an Applebee's steak.  You let her walk all over you, call you names, and then handed over a dream experience to her.  Why would you do that?", "Soft YTA. What a shame for your sweet boyfriend. Your friend with her large ego did not earn that. If she is so specialized in her expertise and blog she could have gotten her own reservations there.\n\nFancy dining isn't for everyone \u2013 it sounds like your boyfriend is maybe a more humble type that prefers to avoid it \u2013 but nevertheless an artistic, beautifully served meal here and there is good for people to experience.  That said, perhaps it doesn't need to be Michelin 3 stars. Look around and see if there are some restaurants with elegant set menus getting praise, and you could arrange a similar date with him that you might enjoy even more for a smaller price.", "NTA but your boyfriend is not wrong.  You earned that bonus and are a doormat for caving to your opportunistic \"friend\".  It sounds like you haven't yet learned that you can't please everyone but you should work hard to please and prioritize the important ones, like yourself and your partner.", "You earned the bonus.  It is not contingent on you being somehow sufficiently qualified to appreciate it.  Your friend does not deserve it because she has more refined tastes.  It would not be wasted on you.  Did I mention you earned it?  YTA for being a doormat.", "YTA, and so is your friend. I loathe the term foodie, like it makes people better than others, completely and totally pretentious. Food, much like art, is in the eye (or the taste in this case) of the beholder. You do not have to be a 'foodie' (wannabe tryhard food critic), to enjoy and appreciate a good meal. Your friend needs to learn her greedy place, and you need to grow a spine and stand up to her.", "To get a Michelin star just means you can consistently produce quality food.

She isn\u2019t your friend and you deserve so much more from your friends.", "YTA. This was a gift for YOU and your friend sounds like a rude snob that bullied you into giving her your spot. You don't need to be a food critic to enjoy good food at a great restaurant. Not to mention this will make you look bad at work when they realize you gave away your reservation. They gave you an opportunity that most people don't get and you spat on it.", "YTA for promising him a nice dinner at a fancy restaurant and then rescinding it. He doesn't need to be a food expert to enjoy good service and good food, even if your friend thinks \"Oh no, but he won't *appreciate* nice things as much as I do\".\n\nBut if I'm the boyfriend I'm more hurt and frustrated that you gave up something you wanted so much just to placate this total asshole of a friend who had no right to demand anything from you. This was your bonus. Your gift - \"the coolest gift ever\". And you just rolled over and passed it up because your friend tried to bully you.

This would have been an amazing experience for you and your boyfriend that you just might not be able to ever do now. \nI also imagine the person that worked to arrange the gift for you is going to be quite upset that you gave it away so don\u2019t expect anything extra special as a work gift again", "I am sure someone at the company will ask OP how the dinner was, knowing when the reservation was. How bad will it look to say they gave it away?", "Exactly! My stomach dropped when I read she gave the reservation away when it was a gift on behalf of her company. \n\nAnd what \u201cfriend\u201d is a vulture enough to pressure someone so much on their earned bonus?", "Wait until OP has to explain to her boss that she gave away the reservation for no reason.\n\nThe firm enjoys her work so much they go out of there way to coordinate a likely difficult reservation and give her a reasonable gift card to accompany it.(it likely won\u2019t cover the meal, but should cover a decent chunk.) Instead of using it, she gives it away without consulting her firm.\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t be surprised if this negatively impacts her relationship with whomever went out of there way to organize this for her.", "It is not contingent on you being somehow sufficiently qualified to appreciate it.", "The boyfriend called OP an idiot, which was kind of mean. I'm still on board with the doormat, that was merely a descriptive term", "No the bf wasn\u2019t mean when it\u2019s the truth.  She was a doormat and an idiot.  It\u2019s better he tells her now so she learn to be more assertive and less easily swayed by so-called \u201cfriend\u201d who is unkind and snobbish."]}
