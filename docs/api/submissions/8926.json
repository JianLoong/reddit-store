Please be kind because I\u2019m sort of fuming but also trying to calm myself by typing this out for internet strangers. \n\nOkay so - long story short, my boyfriend and I live in a major city with a restaurant that has three Michelin stars. It\u2019s so outside our price range that we\u2019ve only ever talked about it in fantastical terms, kind of like the way you\u2019d talk about what you\u2019d do if you were Marie Antoinette at Palais Versailles. Well, lo and behold, as part of my annual bonus, my firm (which is quite small and intimate - they market themselves as a \u201cboutique\u201d specializing in their service expertise) knew I was a big foodie and somehow managed to get me not only reservations to this amazing restaurant but also gave me a $500 gift card to accompany it. \n\nNaturally, I lost my shit. This was the coolest gift ever, even if I would\u2019ve preferred a more generous cash bonus and/or raise, but I also knew I did not have the necessary clout to get a reservation at this particular restaurant, let alone one in the first half of 2023. \n\nSo anyway, the story goes that I obviously intended to bring my boyfriend. However, he\u2019s not a big foodie, and never has been. One of my girlfriends knew this, and not so subtly implied that I should take her in his stead. I asked my boyfriend about this, and him, being the sweet, empathetic boy that he is, was more than willing to give up his seat in lieu of my friend, who arguably is the much bigger foodie than either of us and would\u2019ve probably appreciated the experience more than my boyfriend or I. \n\nYet, I felt super uncomfortable with this and told my friend I would prefer going with my boyfriend to the date. This is a decision that I now regret and which prompted me to write to internet strangers, because she has since accused me of being naive, ignorant, wasteful (because such a dining experience should not be wasted on those who would not have understood the difference like she would\u2019ve), and most hurtful of all, a bad friend. \n\nTo be fair to her, she has always had a passion for food and good restaurants. She has her own food blog which she has diligently posted to since our college days and maintains to this day. I am definitely more of a casual observer of good food, and appreciate the same, as someone who works for a firm that often wines and dines its clients in upper echelon restaurants. She is right, however, when she claims that my boyfriend and I would not be able to tell the difference between a one Michelin starred restaurant versus a three Michelin starred restaurant. Because we probably wouldn\u2019t. \n\nAnyway, I ended up just letting her have the reservation slot and I kept the $500 gift card to potentially use myself or give to someone else with a reservation there, but my boyfriend has kept voicing his disappointment that I\u2019m an idiot and a doormat. Moreover, I feel bad that I promised him a fancy dinner at this three Michelin starred restaurant and then rescinded the offer to give to someone else. \n\nSo, please.

I understand your boyfriend, i dont think his issue is because you promised him a nice dinner there but you suddenly took it back. Like you said, he was more than willing to give it up. I think his problem is because you let yourself be walked over by your friend. You wanted to go there. You have been wanting to go there for a long time. You wanted to go wih your boyfriend. It was your bonus. Not hers. Yours. The michelin restaurant wouldnt give AF if the person eating in their place is a foodie or not. Your friend has NO right to demand that you go with her instead. She has no right to insist that she deserves to go there more than your boyfriend either. The reservation was yours, not hers. She should have shut up the moment she said you didnt wanna go with her.\n\nMichelin restaurants may be an upscale experience, but it doesnt alwyas have to technical. It can just be a couple eating out together in this nice restaurant regardless if you understand how different it is from others.\n\nNow, you have let go of that opportunity and gave it to someone who only didnt deserve it, but was also insulting to your boyfriend. You have also completely changed that friendship dynamic. Now your friend knows she can push you around to get what she wants and you will give in.", "YTA to yourself and your company who went out of this way to treat you. You are a doormat and your friend is a jerk.", "YTA and a doormat.", "Guuuuurl wtf LOL. Why the eff did you give this prized reservation to someone who spoke condescendingly and rudely to you? Friends do not call each other \"naive, ignorant, [and] wasteful\" - let alone over something like this. It was perfectly natural you wanted to share this special experience with your boyfriend...just because he's not a foodie doesn't mean he can't appreciate good food! Furthermore, this was a reward for YOUR hardwork and no one else gets to dictate or judge how you use it.\n\nYour boyfriend is right - you were a doormat and your \"friend\" was trying to use you from the start because she needed this dining experience to add to her food blog. You are NTA, but your friend is and please kick her to the curb. I hope you can get a reservation there in the future so that you can enjoy the dining experience with whomever you choose.", "YTA to yourself\n\nYour friend is a bigger one.\n\nSo your boss went out of their way to get you reservations to a restaurant and you just gave it away?  You let your friend talk you out of your reservation because she says she is a foodie and she has a food blog.\n\nYour friend probably made an idiot of herself getting instagram shots of her food to post.", "YTA. You let your friend guilt trip you out of your bonus. She felt comfortable enough to treat you that way but you also didn\u2019t put your foot down and tell her to back off. Who cares that she\u2019s a \u201cfoodie\u201d. She didn\u2019t work for that reward. Boot your lil friend. She\u2019s an AH too.", "Not sure you are. I think I agree with your BF. Your friend, however is a massive asshole, and not really a friend.", "ESH, your friend for being manipulative and a bully; and you for letting her manipulate and bully you\n\nYour BF is ok though", "YTA - why did you give up something that is so important to you that your colleagues went to a great deal of trouble to. obtain just for you?  I\u2019m sure that will leave a bad taste in their mouth.\nYou should have used their gift for yourself. You robbed yourself and your boyfriend of a once in a lifetime experience.\n\nYou are wrong that you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference in a one-star vs three-star restaurant. It\u2019s an absurd argument.\n\nYour friend is not great for pressuring you but you gave a away a gift that people got just for you.", "YTA to yourself. And yes sorry but you are an absolutely doormat. Your friend was being an asshole here. Who cares if you aren't used to find dining like that. Go have a great time and a fun date with your bf but you let your friend walk all over you and have it up. Do yourself a favour and realise that they are not a friend and drop them.", "I don\u2019t think YTA I think OP friend is. It\u2019s your bonus and she\u2019s essentially emotionally badgered you into caving and giving her the booking. The question isn\u2019t if YTA- true question is why you can\u2019t negotiate conflict like this and cave with a shitty friend makes you feel bad and gets your bonus. It would have been a lovely dinner for you and your partner regardless of whether you are foodies or not. NTA but develop some assertive communication skills with your friend.", "NTA. Your friend is. Anyone with half a brain would know you would want to do this with your boyfriend. If girlfriend wants to go there so much well she needs to pay. Also she needs to get off her high horse, doesn\u2019t matter if you a very unique type of palette it\u2019s about enjoying the experience and the time with your partner. She honestly sounds like an awful friend, one who is jealous that your work has given you an awesome bonus and a reservation slot. \n\nYou are an idiot though for giving her the reservation slot. I mean seriously. This had her walking all over you. You need to learn to stand up for yourself here. You allowed someone to make you feel that you didn\u2019t have a right to go somewhere nice, especially when your work has gone to the effort in securing the slot for you. Dump this friend.", "NTA, good friends aren't jealous.\n\nHer being a \"self proclaimed expert\" or foodie doesn't grant her any privileges on YOUR gifts, that YOU received, from YOUR job.\n\nShe tried to manipulate you, she failed, and now she tries to guilt trip you.\n\nThis person isn't your friend.\n\nps: oh and i forgot to add, you're too guillable.\n\nEdit: i just realized that i had missed the last sentence about you giving her the reservation, your bf is right on that point you really acted like a doormat and should serisously reconsider your relationship with your \"friend\".", "[deleted]", "NTA. Your initial reaction of going with your boyfriend was spot on. There's more to eating fine meals than the menu. It includes the people you eat them with. Sharing this one with your boyfriend would have given you memories of a shared experience beyond the cell phone pictures of the food on the plates.  It would have given you memories of conversation with someone who, presumably, you are close with.\n\nUnfortunately, you were bullied by a fellow foodie. What's more, you gave away a chunk of your bonus as a result of her success.", "NTA, and that is not your friend. I would definitely limit how much I speak to them (if at all).\n\nI\u2019m also petty and would call and either cancel or change the reservation and take my partner.", "Nta, but your friend is. First she convinces you to give up going with your bf. And then she calls it wasted on your bf and you? Please! \nYour bf is right, you shouldn\u2019t have given her the reservation. Is there any way to get it back? \nYou and your bf deserve a nice meal together that you can always cherish in your memory. \n\nYou have to set boundaries with your friends. I know that\u2019s hard bc that often means loneliness, but that\u2019s better than friends like that.", "Hmmm NTA but your foodie friend is a major one!! If she wanted to go so bad why didn't she try for her own reservation? You and your bf could've had an amazing experience at some fancy romantic restaurant and honestly who cares if you can't tell the difference between a 1 or 3 star Michelin. It would've been fun for the 2 of you and not wasteful AT ALL. Instead your friend whined, moaned and insulted the both of you to get what SHE wanted smh. She is not a friend... she only thinks of herself.", "NTA. You are, however, a bit of a fool for passing up the dinner. . \n\nYou should have taken your friend. It's not disloyal to the boyfriend to take her to something he wouldn't dig as much.\n\nAND it's wonderful that the boss would give you a bonus so right in your wheelhouse.", "In general , NTA. But you shouldn\u2019t have allowed your so-called friend to bully you.\n\nFine food/dining is not reserved for \u201cfoodies\u201d, it\u2019s for anyone who wants to and can afford to have it. \n\nSo what if you wouldn\u2019t recognize all the nuances she thinks she would ? I\u2019ve drunk plenty of expensive wine over the years but can\u2019t pick out the flavors connoisseurs can, but I still enjoy the wine.\n\nSee if there\u2019s some way you can either get the reservation back, by hook or crook, or if you can, wrangle another somehow at another time even if it\u2019s ages away.", "NTA. Good grief. Your so called friend is anything but. She's an entitled bully that doesn't deserve your friendship. Your boyfriend is right. Don't be a doormat. Tell your friend to go and fuck herself, rescind the offer and take your BF out for a lovely meal. You'll regret it if you don't.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This whole foodie thing is a load of crap.  You can enjoy food without being a \"foodie\".  I'm sure you can tell a difference between a 5 star steak and an Applebee's steak.  You let her walk all over you, call you names, and then handed over a dream experience to her.  Why would you do that?", "Soft YTA. What a shame for your sweet boyfriend. Your friend with her large ego did not earn that. If she is so specialized in her expertise and blog she could have gotten her own reservations there.\n\nFancy dining isn't for everyone \u2013 it sounds like your boyfriend is maybe a more humble type that prefers to avoid it \u2013 but nevertheless an artistic, beautifully served meal here and there is good for people to experience.

Did I mention you earned it?  YTA for being a doormat.", "YTA, and so is your friend. I loathe the term foodie, like it makes people better than others, completely and totally pretentious. Food, much like art, is in the eye (or the taste in this case) of the beholder. You do not have to be a 'foodie' (wannabe tryhard food critic), to enjoy and appreciate a good meal.

They gave you an opportunity that most people don't get and you spat on it.", "YTA for promising him a nice dinner at a fancy restaurant and then rescinding it. He doesn't need to be a food expert to enjoy good service and good food, even if your friend thinks \"Oh no, but he won't *appreciate* nice things as much as I do\".\n\nBut if I'm the boyfriend I'm more hurt and frustrated that you gave up something you wanted so much just to placate this total asshole of a friend who had no right to demand anything from you.

YOU were the most deserving because you wanted to go and you EARNED it.

Your boyfriend was kind thinking it's what you wanted with your friend, but correct in that when you wanted to assert yourself and found you couldn't you became a doormat and gave away the reservation.  Better no one get something (including you) than the person bullying you when you still feel like maybe you're wrong, right?  That self-sabotage because it can be hard to reconcile your desires over someone elses.\n\nIf it's too late to use the original reservation, call immediately and see about getting a new one and make sure that gift certificate doesn't expire.

A \u201cfriend\u201d bullies you like this? Get rid of that person.\n\nMan that bit pissed me off no end.", "You have no right to be upset about this because you acted without a spine. You\u2019re upset because of something YOU did to yourself and your poor boyfriend. The only person you have to blame is yourself. YTA", "YTA and also a dumbass. Why TF would you do that?! This is not the ending I thought you would have chose at all. Why wouldn\u2019t you take your bf with you, have a wonderful time and tell your other friend to get bent?", "Just how", "If I did this and then wrote down what happened, I\u2019d be so ashamed that I\u2019d delete it. So yes, you\u2019re an asshole squared.", "I'm slightly confused about a practical thing; is the reservation for one or two? Why is ONLY your friend going when you were going to go with two people?", "YTA to yourself   She complained so you gave it to her? Your logic puzzles me", "YTA.  Rescind that back and go on a fancy pants date with your honey.  Forget the foodie person who is taking advantage of you.", "YTA. Try treating your boyfriend as a real human being with feelings and, you know, taste buds and everything. And stop  serving the dictates of your \"friend\" who just wants to be a foodie-blogger-\"influencer\" and demand she be treated to a free expensive meal because she is better than you and your boyfriend.\n\nLook, this was YOUR bonus, not your \"friend\"'s. And you should enjoy the meal with someone who you (presumably) care about.", "I hope the boss wasn't intending to surprise OP with his own reservation at her table with her and the boyfriend.", "OP notice how she took that reservation and still didn\u2019t take you? Tells you all you need to know.", "Hi everyone from M\u00e9xico (sorry for my English).\n\nWhen the OP said that she works in a \"Firm\", I imagined she is a lawyer.

You're a doormat and I want an update on this.\n\nWho gives a fuck if your friend is a foodie? Who cares if she has a blog? Millions of people have a food blog. Heck, I HAVE A FOOD BLOG!  But I would never dream of stealing from a friend. It's not her bonus and she's not the person you want to eat with. She reeks of toxic entitlement and anyone who acted the way she did towards you is not your friend. \n\nYou better get that reservation back because it would look so bad for you at work. Jesus Christ. Why are people like this?", "OP, DO NOT give away the gift card. Check and see when it expires. Chances are it doesn't or you at least have a couple years to use it. This gives you time to find a way to get a reservation even if it is a year or more away. Everyone else has already said you let yourself be treated like a doormat so I am not going to add to that. Just try and use your resources to potentially get a reservation there so YOU and YOUR boyfriend can use the gift card. \n\nMy boyfriend and I LOVE food. We love trying new places and once a year we'll go to an upscale restaurant to celebrate something or to just treat ourselves. We love to cook too but we aren't professional chefs. That doesn't mean we don't get to enjoy upscale restaurants or fancy food. If anything it's not just the food, it's also the experience. I've never been to a 3 michelin star restaurant but I imagine the dining experience is outstanding. I've had awesome experiences in a very upscale steak house because the waiters are extremely accommodating, the chef would make things that we asked for if it wasn't on the menu, they decorated our dessert with a \"happy anniversary\" (when we were there for our anniversary), and they just did everything to make sure we had a good time and got our money's worth. Bottom line, fine dining restaurants are also about the experience, not just the food. You and your boyfriend deserved to have the experience and the good food.", "She may be a foodie but not entitled to something YOU EARNED.You can do what you want with it, but I would take it back from her.NTA OP, but you friend is.", "YTA.\n\nJust because your friend envied your reservation does not mean she was entitled to it. It doesn\u2019t matter if you ordinarily \u201cdine out\u201d via drive-thru, it was awarded to you. Being a snob doesn\u2019t mean she has a right to your reservation.\n\nYou did promise your boyfriend an outing, then gave it away because your \u201cfriend\u201d bullied you into giving her your reservation. Not only did you promise him an outing, but it was one you had dreamed of being able to do together. \n\nWhat a disappointment to him to know not only can you not stand up for yourself, but that you don\u2019t stand by your promises, either.", "YTA, I\u2019m sorry. You let this person manipulate and bully you into giving her this reservation. She\u2019s obviously a huge asshole but you never should have caved.  I will also add that it doesn\u2019t make you look great to your company that you gave away a reservation they specifically got for you (sure you can lie and say there was an emergency, but eh). \n\nYou need to cut this \u201cfriend\u201d loose. Get back the reservation if you can.", "YTA to yourself and your boyfriend. Sad and spineless.", "YTA so much to yourself and your bf, why the hell didn't you just cut the conversation short? Why did you roll over like an obedient pet?

We'll set you on the right path ;)\n\nYou seem like a nice person who will be taken advantage of.  Your BF seems nice also.  The world will destroy both of you.", "You're not an asshole because you were genuinely trying to make yourself and others happy. However, you need to not let others walk all over you. Your \"friend\" should never have put you in that position in the first place.", "YTA\n\nIf the dinner hasn\u2019t already happened- tell the other party that she isn\u2019t going.

You wanted to and you lost out because you let yourself be bullied. \n\nAsk your firm to help you reschedule. Go with your boyfriend and dump the \u201cfriend\u201d. She\u2019s the bigger AH but you let her be one to you and your bf so you\u2019re losing your sh*t over your own dumb choice.", "Hot damn how\u2019d you fuck this up so grandly? \n\nNow, get some balls and get that reservation back. \n\nThis should be AmITheIdiot.

Your \"friend\" is TA.", "It doesn't matter if your friend is a \"foodie.\"  You don't owe her a trip to that restaurant.  Let me repeat that: you don't owe her a trip to that restaurant, no matter how much of a snob she is about food.  She has no right to decide who is good enough to eat at any restaurant.  I wouldn't call you an a-hole, but I'd agree with your boyfriend that you're a doormat for giving in to her narcissistic and absolutely unjustified guilt trip.  Your friend's estimation of herself and her knowledge of food is absurdly unrealistic.  Food \"expertise\" is mostly phony, designed to keep people like her in the job of being a hedonist.  She sounds like a badly written, pretentious snob character in a cheap comedy. She's clearly a bully and unlikable. You should have chosen whom you wanted to take and said tough luck to anyone who didn't like it.", "Seems like you couldn\u2019t handle the situation, gave up the reso, made yourself the victim of these people, but you are only the victim of your own doormatterry.

She was just jealous. \nRestaurants like those are as much about the experience as the food - otherwise they don\u2019t get their third star.", "ESH\nI hope you dump your friend for being an absolute jerk to you. Taking down to you like oh your poor peasant you wouldn\u2019t know good food if it bit you on the ass, so why waste this dining experience on you and your bf when you could give it to some one much more nuanced in culinary arts and with a more sophisticated palate that can *actually* tell the difference by a 1 and 3 Michelin star restaurant???\nAnd you did it. \nLike holy shit lady get a spine. You and your friend suck ass", "If you can still fix this, do it now. Call the restaurant and tell them there was a mistake and you will be using your reservation.

But she had a free pass to a potentially great experience and she caved because her \"friend\" told her she wasn't worthy enough for the experience and should defer to someone more sophisticated.  Ooooh, and shit friend had just the person in mind to jump in and show her how it's done.   The fiend played on OP's insecurities.
