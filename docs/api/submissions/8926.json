Please be kind because I\u2019m sort of fuming but also trying to calm myself by typing this out for internet strangers. \n\nOkay so - long story short, my boyfriend and I live in a major city with a restaurant that has three Michelin stars. It\u2019s so outside our price range that we\u2019ve only ever talked about it in fantastical terms, kind of like the way you\u2019d talk about what you\u2019d do if you were Marie Antoinette at Palais Versailles. Well, lo and behold, as part of my annual bonus, my firm (which is quite small and intimate - they market themselves as a \u201cboutique\u201d specializing in their service expertise) knew I was a big foodie and somehow managed to get me not only reservations to this amazing restaurant but also gave me a $500 gift card to accompany it. \n\nNaturally, I lost my shit. This was the coolest gift ever, even if I would\u2019ve preferred a more generous cash bonus and/or raise, but I also knew I did not have the necessary clout to get a reservation at this particular restaurant, let alone one in the first half of 2023. \n\nSo anyway, the story goes that I obviously intended to bring my boyfriend. However, he\u2019s not a big foodie, and never has been. One of my girlfriends knew this, and not so subtly implied that I should take her in his stead. I asked my boyfriend about this, and him, being the sweet, empathetic boy that he is, was more than willing to give up his seat in lieu of my friend, who arguably is the much bigger foodie than either of us and would\u2019ve probably appreciated the experience more than my boyfriend or I. \n\nYet, I felt super uncomfortable with this and told my friend I would prefer going with my boyfriend to the date. This is a decision that I now regret and which prompted me to write to internet strangers, because she has since accused me of being naive, ignorant, wasteful (because such a dining experience should not be wasted on those who would not have understood the difference like she would\u2019ve), and most hurtful of all, a bad friend. \n\nTo be fair to her, she has always had a passion for food and good restaurants. She has her own food blog which she has diligently posted to since our college days and maintains to this day. I am definitely more of a casual observer of good food, and appreciate the same, as someone who works for a firm that often wines and dines its clients in upper echelon restaurants. She is right, however, when she claims that my boyfriend and I would not be able to tell the difference between a one Michelin starred restaurant versus a three Michelin starred restaurant. Because we probably wouldn\u2019t. \n\nAnyway, I ended up just letting her have the reservation slot and I kept the $500 gift card to potentially use myself or give to someone else with a reservation there, but my boyfriend has kept voicing his disappointment that I\u2019m an idiot and a doormat. Moreover, I feel bad that I promised him a fancy dinner at this three Michelin starred restaurant and then rescinded the offer to give to someone else. \n\nSo, please.

I understand your boyfriend, i dont think his issue is because you promised him a nice dinner there but you suddenly took it back. Like you said, he was more than willing to give it up. I think his problem is because you let yourself be walked over by your friend. You wanted to go there. You have been wanting to go there for a long time. You wanted to go wih your boyfriend. It was your bonus. Not hers. Yours. The michelin restaurant wouldnt give AF if the person eating in their place is a foodie or not. Your friend has NO right to demand that you go with her instead. She has no right to insist that she deserves to go there more than your boyfriend either. The reservation was yours, not hers. She should have shut up the moment she said you didnt wanna go with her.\n\nMichelin restaurants may be an upscale experience, but it doesnt alwyas have to technical. It can just be a couple eating out together in this nice restaurant regardless if you understand how different it is from others.\n\nNow, you have let go of that opportunity and gave it to someone who only didnt deserve it, but was also insulting to your boyfriend. You have also completely changed that friendship dynamic. Now your friend knows she can push you around to get what she wants and you will give in.", "YTA to yourself and your company who went out of this way to treat you. You are a doormat and your friend is a jerk.", "YTA and a doormat.", "Guuuuurl wtf LOL. Why the eff did you give this prized reservation to someone who spoke condescendingly and rudely to you? Friends do not call each other \"naive, ignorant, [and] wasteful\" - let alone over something like this. It was perfectly natural you wanted to share this special experience with your boyfriend...just because he's not a foodie doesn't mean he can't appreciate good food! Furthermore, this was a reward for YOUR hardwork and no one else gets to dictate or judge how you use it.\n\nYour boyfriend is right - you were a doormat and your \"friend\" was trying to use you from the start because she needed this dining experience to add to her food blog. You are NTA, but your friend is and please kick her to the curb. I hope you can get a reservation there in the future so that you can enjoy the dining experience with whomever you choose.", "YTA to yourself\n\nYour friend is a bigger one.\n\nSo your boss went out of their way to get you reservations to a restaurant and you just gave it away?  You let your friend talk you out of your reservation because she says she is a foodie and she has a food blog.\n\nYour friend probably made an idiot of herself getting instagram shots of her food to post.", "YTA. You let your friend guilt trip you out of your bonus. She felt comfortable enough to treat you that way but you also didn\u2019t put your foot down and tell her to back off. Who cares that she\u2019s a \u201cfoodie\u201d. She didn\u2019t work for that reward. Boot your lil friend. She\u2019s an AH too.", "Not sure you are. I think I agree with your BF. Your friend, however is a massive asshole, and not really a friend.", "ESH, your friend for being manipulative and a bully; and you for letting her manipulate and bully you\n\nYour BF is ok though", "YTA - why did you give up something that is so important to you that your colleagues went to a great deal of trouble to. obtain just for you?  I\u2019m sure that will leave a bad taste in their mouth.\nYou should have used their gift for yourself. You robbed yourself and your boyfriend of a once in a lifetime experience.\n\nYou are wrong that you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell the difference in a one-star vs three-star restaurant. It\u2019s an absurd argument.\n\nYour friend is not great for pressuring you but you gave a away a gift that people got just for you.", "YTA to yourself. And yes sorry but you are an absolutely doormat. Your friend was being an asshole here. Who cares if you aren't used to find dining like that. Go have a great time and a fun date with your bf but you let your friend walk all over you and have it up. Do yourself a favour and realise that they are not a friend and drop them.", "I don\u2019t think YTA I think OP friend is. It\u2019s your bonus and she\u2019s essentially emotionally badgered you into caving and giving her the booking. The question isn\u2019t if YTA- true question is why you can\u2019t negotiate conflict like this and cave with a shitty friend makes you feel bad and gets your bonus. It would have been a lovely dinner for you and your partner regardless of whether you are foodies or not. NTA but develop some assertive communication skills with your friend.", "NTA. Your friend is. Anyone with half a brain would know you would want to do this with your boyfriend. If girlfriend wants to go there so much well she needs to pay. Also she needs to get off her high horse, doesn\u2019t matter if you a very unique type of palette it\u2019s about enjoying the experience and the time with your partner. She honestly sounds like an awful friend, one who is jealous that your work has given you an awesome bonus and a reservation slot. \n\nYou are an idiot though for giving her the reservation slot. I mean seriously. This had her walking all over you. You need to learn to stand up for yourself here. You allowed someone to make you feel that you didn\u2019t have a right to go somewhere nice, especially when your work has gone to the effort in securing the slot for you. Dump this friend.", "NTA, good friends aren't jealous.\n\nHer being a \"self proclaimed expert\" or foodie doesn't grant her any privileges on YOUR gifts, that YOU received, from YOUR job.\n\nShe tried to manipulate you, she failed, and now she tries to guilt trip you.\n\nThis person isn't your friend.\n\nps: oh and i forgot to add, you're too guillable.\n\nEdit: i just realized that i had missed the last sentence about you giving her the reservation, your bf is right on that point you really acted like a doormat and should serisously reconsider your relationship with your \"friend\".", "INFO: I don\u2019t really see the conflict here. It sounds like ur friend just sucks and is the AH. It\u2019s not their bonus, and they shouldn\u2019t have a say on who deserves it more when they didn\u2019t earn it to begin with. I\u2019m a little muddy on details tho. How far in advance did u tell ur bf u were going?", "NTA. Your initial reaction of going with your boyfriend was spot on. There's more to eating fine meals than the menu. It includes the people you eat them with. Sharing this one with your boyfriend would have given you memories of a shared experience beyond the cell phone pictures of the food on the plates.  It would have given you memories of conversation with someone who, presumably, you are close with.\n\nUnfortunately, you were bullied by a fellow foodie. What's more, you gave away a chunk of your bonus as a result of her success.", "NTA, and that is not your friend. I would definitely limit how much I speak to them (if at all).\n\nI\u2019m also petty and would call and either cancel or change the reservation and take my partner.", "Nta, but your friend is. First she convinces you to give up going with your bf. And then she calls it wasted on your bf and you? Please! \nYour bf is right, you shouldn\u2019t have given her the reservation. Is there any way to get it back? \nYou and your bf deserve a nice meal together that you can always cherish in your memory. \n\nYou have to set boundaries with your friends. I know that\u2019s hard bc that often means loneliness, but that\u2019s better than friends like that.", "Hmmm NTA but your foodie friend is a major one!! If she wanted to go so bad why didn't she try for her own reservation? You and your bf could've had an amazing experience at some fancy romantic restaurant and honestly who cares if you can't tell the difference between a 1 or 3 star Michelin. It would've been fun for the 2 of you and not wasteful AT ALL. Instead your friend whined, moaned and insulted the both of you to get what SHE wanted smh. She is not a friend... she only thinks of herself.", "NTA. You are, however, a bit of a fool for passing up the dinner. . \n\nYou should have taken your friend. It's not disloyal to the boyfriend to take her to something he wouldn't dig as much.\n\nAND it's wonderful that the boss would give you a bonus so right in your wheelhouse.", "In general , NTA. But you shouldn\u2019t have allowed your so-called friend to bully you.\n\nFine food/dining is not reserved for \u201cfoodies\u201d, it\u2019s for anyone who wants to and can afford to have it. \n\nSo what if you wouldn\u2019t recognize all the nuances she thinks she would ? I\u2019ve drunk plenty of expensive wine over the years but can\u2019t pick out the flavors connoisseurs can, but I still enjoy the wine.\n\nSee if there\u2019s some way you can either get the reservation back, by hook or crook, or if you can, wrangle another somehow at another time even if it\u2019s ages away.", "NTA. Good grief. Your so called friend is anything but. She's an entitled bully that doesn't deserve your friendship. Your boyfriend is right. Don't be a doormat. Tell your friend to go and fuck herself, rescind the offer and take your BF out for a lovely meal. You'll regret it if you don't.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This whole foodie thing is a load of crap.  You can enjoy food without being a \"foodie\".  I'm sure you can tell a difference between a 5 star steak and an Applebee's steak.  You let her walk all over you, call you names, and then handed over a dream experience to her.  Why would you do that?", "Soft YTA. What a shame for your sweet boyfriend. Your friend with her large ego did not earn that. If she is so specialized in her expertise and blog she could have gotten her own reservations there.\n\nFancy dining isn't for everyone \u2013 it sounds like your boyfriend is maybe a more humble type that prefers to avoid it \u2013 but nevertheless an artistic, beautifully served meal here and there is good for people to experience.  That said, perhaps it doesn't need to be Michelin 3 stars. Look around and see if there are some restaurants with elegant set menus getting praise, and you could arrange a similar date with him that you might enjoy even more for a smaller price.", "NTA but your boyfriend is not wrong.  You earned that bonus and are a doormat for caving to your opportunistic \"friend\".  It sounds like you haven't yet learned that you can't please everyone but you should work hard to please and prioritize the important ones, like yourself and your partner.", "You earned the bonus.  It is not contingent on you being somehow sufficiently qualified to appreciate it.  Your friend does not deserve it because she has more refined tastes.  It would not be wasted on you.  Did I mention you earned it?  YTA for being a doormat.", "YTA, and so is your friend. I loathe the term foodie, like it makes people better than others, completely and totally pretentious. Food, much like art, is in the eye (or the taste in this case) of the beholder. You do not have to be a 'foodie' (wannabe tryhard food critic), to enjoy and appreciate a good meal. Your friend needs to learn her greedy place, and you need to grow a spine and stand up to her.", "To get a Michelin star just means you can consistently produce quality food.

She isn\u2019t your friend and you deserve so much more from your friends.", "YTA. This was a gift for YOU and your friend sounds like a rude snob that bullied you into giving her your spot. You don't need to be a food critic to enjoy good food at a great restaurant. Not to mention this will make you look bad at work when they realize you gave away your reservation. They gave you an opportunity that most people don't get and you spat on it.", "YTA for promising him a nice dinner at a fancy restaurant and then rescinding it. He doesn't need to be a food expert to enjoy good service and good food, even if your friend thinks \"Oh no, but he won't *appreciate* nice things as much as I do\".\n\nBut if I'm the boyfriend I'm more hurt and frustrated that you gave up something you wanted so much just to placate this total asshole of a friend who had no right to demand anything from you. This was your bonus. Your gift - \"the coolest gift ever\". And you just rolled over and passed it up because your friend tried to bully you.

Even if someone else might enjoy it more, or be snobbier about it, or understand it more (major eye rolling here from me).", "Why do you allow people to treat you like that? I hate that you allow yourself to be bullied.", "I hardly understand any of the reasoning in your post.\n\nWhy did you even get your friend involved in all of this and what was supposed to be a lovely evening for you and your boyfriend? YTA for that, she's an AH too by the way, for all this nonsense about being able to discern between a three and a one star restaurant, gimme a break! She sounds like a boring snob.\n\nThere are two movies I think you should watch, one is old, Babette's Feast, it's about a master chef who cooks for a group of people who have no understanding of refined food, but the dinner brings out such happiness in them. The other is new, The Menu, full of horrible food snobs who have forgotten that food is really about pleasure.", "YTA, a doormat, and you need to discard your \"friend\" who had the poor character to treat you like that.", "Yta and your friend is an entitled and rude female dog. Yes you are a doormat", "ESH, and your friend is not your friend.", "You and your friend should watch The Menu.", "I have to say that an AH no prob not,you did try to make every 1 happy in this case so to speak.But from what you wrote your friend is just big mad cuz she ddnt get a chance to go to this place for free and surly write a huge article about it in her blog.Your mistake was offering it to her in the first place,it dosnt matter if you or your bf are foodies or not, your still going out to an amazing place to eat good food and coulda had an amazing night out regardless of the food.I will add that why you might be a bit of an AH is because u alrdy did tell your friend and then changed your mind,though honstly after the way u describe she acted I agree with others here that say u shouldn't have givin her anything at all.", "YTA Sigh you honestly made me so disappointed that there are people as weak willed as you are in this world, grow a spine", "Silver lining is that you won't have to dine with a food blogger. Having someone tell me what to order (because they want to try everything), take pictures of every dish from every angle, critiquing everything from the taste to the plating and constantly wanting to try my food would sour the experience for me.", "YTA. And you need to seriously reconsider giving that slot away. Is it in your name or did you just say she can use it? Your WORK is what's being rewarded not your tastes. You're going to be questioned about it at your job and how do you think they're going to respond to finding out you didn't use it?", "ESH. Your boyfriend is right - you have been a AH to yourself. The Michelin experience is only partially about the food. It is usually the whole ambience - waiters who are happy to explain the food to you (that's how you learn), attentive service and chance to try mixtures of flavours that usually aren't an option. Most of their customers aren't foodies and they'd have given you a wonderful experience.\n\nYou are an AH to your company. What are you going to say to them about why you ducked out on this wonderful opportunity they gave you? They gifted this to you because they appreciate you and wanted to make sure you knew it. Yes, once the gift is your's, you can do what you like with it but it's a bit of a slap in the face to the organiser.\n\nAnd your friend is a total AH, bigging up her blog at your expense by manipulating you into giving her the slot. I hope she keeps your name out of it if she is the type to photo her food or write bad reviews to be edgy. The restaurant will know who booked that slot and it will likely get back to your business if they regularly entertain there. Your friend wasn't happy you'd have a great experience with your boyfriend. She had to take it from you to improve her brand. \n\nCall the restaurant - ask them to put you on the cancellation list and take your boyfriend out.", "OP, that\u2019s not a friend. That\u2019s someone who knows how to feed your insecurities and manipulates you for personal gain. Your boyfriend is right to be frustrated and upset because he can see what your pretend friend is doing to you. I\u2019m going to say that you are NTA this time. However, pretend friend has shown you who she really is, if you continue to be manipulated by her, you will have nobody but yourself to blame. I strongly advise that you make another reservation and spend that 500 dollars on you and someone who cares about you.", "Would you have given her the $500 if she'd demanded it from you on the same terms? \"You are too poor to understand the implications of earning a bonus. Poor people often naively overspend when they receive any kind of additional money; so I just know you'll end up wasting it on something frivolous! You really need to give it to me. As a person more used to the finer things in life, I'll use it to enrich my life story and to create an experience!\" \n\nWould you have forked over $500 just because she told you you didn't deserve it? You know you wouldn't have, so why let her talk you out of a reservation that likely had at least a much value as the reservation itself? \n\nYou are lucky enough to work for a company that values their employees enough to spend time finding a personalized gift! By giving away the reservation, you just spit in the face of the effort and the favor they had to call in to get that reservation. If i were you, I'd get back on the waiting list and stash that $500 away. That way, you can at least tell your peers that something came up and that you had to reschedule the dinner. Hopefully, they'll forget before the next bonus time rolls around. \n\nDo yourself a favor and lose that \"friend's\" contact info and block them. They absolutely manipulated and used you for the benefit of their food blog, and you let them.\n\nETA, YTA.", "This is just sad and pathetic. YTA, obviously. And your friend, too. Major asshole, that one.", "YTA to yourself for letting your \"friend\" walk all over you like that.  It was your reservation, she had no right to it.  I'm glad you at least kept the gift card, and I hope you will be able to get another reservation in the future.  Please actually keep it and use it yourself, don't give it away to someone else with a reservation - you deserve to take your boyfriend to a fancy restaurant and enjoy yourself there.  It's okay to have nice things for yourself sometimes.  Any friend who pushes you like that is not a very good friend at all.", "YTA. Should have kept the reservation and ditched the friend. \n\nYou are indeed a doormat.", "Who is to say who is better at *eating food* it was your bonus and you should have used it as you saw fit. Unfortunately you let your \u201cfriend\u201d bully you out of a really cool experience because they thought they would appreciate it more, screw that. It was your gift card/ reservation but it does kinda suck that you gave it away under duress and missed a cool experience for you and your boyfriend.\nYou are kinda TA for uninviting your bf because of your friend acting entitled.", "YTA your company did something incredibly generous and you throw it away to an asshole. Your friend is a selfish egotistical ass. In future I hope you realize this and move on. Your bf is correct.  Who cares if he wouldn\u2019t appreciate it the way your foodie friend would?! Wouldn\u2019t you both have a great experience together?", "YTA for caving in to your asshole friend's demands. Your friend is clearly entitled...why? Because she likes to eat food? People like this need to get over themselves. This was an experience and you two should have enjoyed it. You clearly know how hard it is to get into this restaurant, so who says you wouldn't have appreciated it? \n\nAlso..watch The Menu on HBO Max. It's basically about people like your friend.", "Oh wow\u2026 are you for real? Why be a martyr? What does it matter what your \u201cfriend\u201d thinks? Tell her no, keep the reservation and take your bf! If she was a true friend, she wouldn\u2019t be trying to leech your good comings. Her reasoning is pointless, there is always going to be a bigger fan of something, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t do it! \n\nYTA to yourself.", "Gently, YTA.  Mostly to yourself.\n\nThe friend is a major asshole.\n\nA good friend would be genuinely happy for you and tell you to enjoy a well-earned nice night at a nice place with your bf.  She sounds rude, entitled and opportunistic as fuck and were I in your shoes, this whole situation would sour my feelings about the friendship.  I couldn\u2019t imagine feeling entitled to someone else\u2019s reward and it boggles my mind that someone can act this way over something that was never theirs to begin with.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you were put in that position and berated like that, but it sounds like she got what she wanted out of it, at your expense (in more ways than one).  Unfortunately, in the face of that abhorrent and bullying behavior, you caved and robbed yourself (and in a way, your bf) of something you\u2019ve been wanting for a while.  I\u2019d be mad at myself too.\n\nPlease, take this situation as a learning experience.  Don\u2019t let other people bully you into giving up something you worked for and rightfully earned, no matter what cards they try to play.  You wouldn\u2019t have been a bad person for enjoying something that was given to you, and you don\u2019t have to be \u201cqualified\u201d in any way to enjoy a gift.\n\nI genuinely hope you learn from this and don\u2019t do this to yourself again.  You deserved that dinner and your friend was so wrong on so many levels.\n\nEdit: some more thoughts", "You're an idiot for sure, she's not your friend.", "I don't understand how you jumped from \"I'll take my friend instead of my boyfriend\" which sort of made sense and would have been generous of you, to giving the whole thing away to someone who is actively being mean to you? \n\nESH ? Your friend isn't a friend. Your boyfriend calling you a doormat isn't helping *anything* in this situation, but your decision making is super bad here.", "YTA and a doormat. Why do you let people walk all over you? It was your reservation and you get to choose who comes.", "YTA and a doormat\n\nThis should be a red flag for your BF because you being a doormat is gonna cost him something at some point.", "Youre like a self-AH. Idk how she convinced you she deserved your reward for hard work. Has this already happened? Why wouldn\u2019t you be going with her? Just keep your own damn reservation slot and tell her no dice! \n\nAlso why is your friend the equivalent of Nicolas Hoult in The Menu? Why should it matter if she could tell the difference between one star and three\u2014sincerely doubtful? everyone has a mouth and needs food, she\u2019s not special. It has nothing to do with her. She can yes chef herself right out of your life because that\u2019s not a friend.", "YTA. That reservation was for YOU \ud83d\ude44 people complain every day, every hour, every SECOND about their jobs and how unappreciated they feel there.

Girl, make it make sense!!! \ud83d\ude2b", "I wouldn't call you an \"idiot\" like he did, I wouldn't say that to just about anyone.\n\nBut \"doormat\"?  Yep. You boyfriend nailed that one.\n\nYTA.", "NTA I guess I see an AH differently, but maybe a pushover, I\u2019m not trying to be mean, I think I\u2019m one too! Moving forward I\u2019d watch my \u201cfriend\u201d, she threw a tantrum over something that she was not entitled to at all! And was very condescending about it", "NTA: Your friend is a major AH for making your hard earned reward about her. And your Boyfriend is a bit of an AH for how he responded to you after having already said he was willing to forego the experience.  \n\n\nYou do need to take some time and learn how to stand up for yourself, but are not an AH.", "The friend is an asshole, too. She's a user, trying to manipulate OP into giving her the reservation and acting as though the spot was already hers (which, well--looks like knows OP well; she was right about that).", "She is not your friend.", "OP... I have never once in my life expected a friend to take me somewhere fancy just because I liked it. I LOVE Shakespeare. I took several classes on Shakespeare in college and went to Cambridge and studied him. With that said, if I had a friend who was going to go to Globe Theatre with her partner, I wouldn't even THINK that I should be invited instead. It's not about who would enjoy it more. It's her experience. She'll go with who she wants. \n\nYour \"friend\" isn't a friend. Cut her off. Keep the reservation. Block her on all social media. And get into therapy. NO ONE should be this much of a doormat. I've been called a doormat more times than I can count. I've gone to therapy to work on it. And I think you're a doormat. You will give and give, and the people in your life will take and take, and when you have nothing left, they'll be pissed at you. So, just STOP.\n\nSincerely, text her, \"I have thought long and hard about how angry you got at me for wanting to take my partner to a restaurant, for wanting to use my gift from my employers to treat myself and my partner.

And, I have no desire to talk to you again. With friends like you, I don't need enemies.\" Then, block her on everything.\n\nShe'll be pissed because she can't treat you like garbage any longer.

OP could have said no to this entitled 'friend', and enjoyed a nice dinner with the BF. Instead, she didn't and now she is complaining about it. This is a \"tough sh*t\" situation that OP had complete control to put a stop to.", "Your friend is the real AH here - a rude, entitled AH who doesn\u2019t actually care about you as a friend. I just watched The Menu and I bet she\u2019s just like Tyler - a self-absorbed foodie who thinks they know everything just because they\u2019ve watched every episode of Chef\u2019s Table. \n\nDecent humans don\u2019t insult their friends\u2019 palette in an effort to coerce something for themselves. You need to grow a spine and get your reso back", ">Michelin restaurants may be an upscale experience, but it doesnt alwyas have to technical. It can just be a couple eating out together in this nice restaurant regardless if you understand how different it is from others.\n\nAbsolutely this. There's a nice restaurant near my home - it doesn't have a Michelin star, but a dinner there will still set you back 100-150$ each. More, if you're not careful with the wine menu. \n\nMy GF and I aren't great foodies, but we still enjoy going there once or twice a year. Dress up, take a cab, make a night out of it. Because it's a great feeling to be pampered by a couple waiters, a sommelier, and... whatever the name is for the guy who does the same with cheese. \n\nOP shouldn't have let her AH friend bully her into giving that up.", "Friend sounds like Tyler from The Menu.", ">You robbed yourself and your boyfriend of a once in a lifetime experience.\n\nShe didn't, she still has the gift card to use there, she just needs to book another reservation.", "My fiancee introduced me to fine dining during our relationship.

You don't necessarily have to be a foodie to be blown away. \n\nI can't believe OP let her \"friend\" pressure her into giving her reservation. OP, if the reservation hasn't occurred yet, you need to rescind the offer and go yourself. It's going to be embarrassing for you if you have to explain to your boss that you didn't go. How are you going to use the gift card if you don't go there? That is *your* bonus, and was a thoughtful one at that.  You just let some AH convince you she was more deserving.\n\nIf the reservation has occurred, call the restaurant and get on the waitlist and book out for 6 months. They do get cancellations and changes. We were able to get into a a michelin restaurant the same week due to a cancellation. \n\nAnd lastly, you have no business taking anyone other than your BF who I assume has been supportive of you and your career, and was generous enough to offer to let someone else have his seat. \n\nYou do need to grow a spine.

Not only will this ruin work relationships, but it'll make OP look like a grifter. Workplaces also tend to have rules about who can enjoy the benefits they give to employees, and if they hear \"oh I gave away the nice thing you went out of your way and spent a lot of time/money to get me to a \"friend\"\" it'll sound like she's exploiting the benefits system.\n\nOP might have actually just put her entire job in danger. She's pretty much deeply insulted the people who spent a lot of time and money to arrange this for her and they'll find it hard to trust her with anything ever again. Not just gifts, but with work as well. From her employer's point of view, they were conned into paying for an outsider's extremely expensive dinner.", "Right!?
