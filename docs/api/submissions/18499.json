There is help out there.", "> but I said, \"Maybe you\u2019d have more energy if you had a job.\" \n\nThis right here is a cheap shot and doesn't even make sense, not to mention a drama starter. Can't blame your mom for asking you to leave. You tout that you've had a job since high school, go to school currently, and live on your own, yet here you are starting unnecessary, childish drama at a family BBQ.\n\n\nYTA. You are taking a problem that has nothing to do with you, and making it your problem. Comments like that are not going to help him. He's an adult, his job situation is his to deal with, and if he's not paying rent to your mom, that's up to your mom to sort out. I also think you are not accounting for details you may be unaware of here, like if he may be dealing with some mental health issues or other problems in his life.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your place to shame him. If your parents have an issue with him not paying rent or his lack of employment, they can talk to him. It\u2019s not your place. If all the poking and prodding hasn\u2019t worked before, you\u2019re just beating a dead horse. A family bbq for the holiday isn\u2019t the time nor place for such shaming anyway.", "YTA. sounds like you feel superior to your brother because you\u2019ve kept a job, moved out and go to school. you should understand that every one\u2019s path is different and if you feel so bad about your mother being overworked and paying rent maybe you should help her out instead of complaining that other people don\u2019t.", "What a trash sister. If you are so concerned about him not having a steady job and him not helping to pay rent, you pay it instead and help him find a job instead of berating him", "YTA - if you were concerned about his well being, this wasn\u2019t how to help him.", "YTA. He was tired. You took it too far. If you want to talk to your brother about him not having a job and checking in on him do it in private.", "YTA. You obviously resent the hell out of your brother, but that's a \"you\" problem. Bullying him at a family bbq isn't going to pay your mother's rent. Honestly it sounds like he has depression. Regardless, it sounds like there's no indication that anyone resents him except you, and I'm sure your mother is quite capable of speaking for herself. So stay out of it, and skip the family gatherings until you can at least be in your brother's presence without picking on him.", "In your comments you say that your brother has anxiety, depression, is on meds, and is in therapy. Clearly, he is struggling (probably more than you know) and trying to manage life the best he can as a 21-year-old. \n\nI'm not sure why you feel the need to insert yourself into any of this, to be honest. Seems kind of like you enjoy comparing yourself to him and try to make him feel beneath you. The fact that you chose to hound him about this (something that really is none of your business) in front of others was totally out of line. \n\nYTA. You owe your brother an apology. He needs encouragement and support, not condescending lectures and scoldings.", "YTA. Sounds like your brother's probably going through some shit, and what you said was totally unnecessary and cruel.", "You just sound like a snob tbh", "YTA. Yes a job would be good but that was a weird time to bring it up, and on what planet does a job give you more energy? Seems like just an excuse to scold. Plus the extra tired/down vibe could be from already dreading the social event.\n\nHe sounds like he needs help though.\n\nEdit: wait did you do this *at* the BBQ?? Or right before?", "YTA. Is he asking your for money? Has he negatively impacted your parents finances? It\u2019s not your circus, why are you petting their monkeys? Live and let live. They\u2019re making it work, mind your business. Down the road if things haven\u2019t changed, sit them down and explain that you accept no financial responsibility for your brother should something happen to them, so they need to prepare and make alternate plans. Realistically, he will probably figure it out before that and finally \u2018launch\u2019. Don\u2019t ruin any potential relationship for the figure with misguided behavior now.", "YTA. Firstly, your aggressive push for independence was your journey, not his, so telling him that he needs to act a specific way is both rude and none of your business. Secondly, you instigated a fight at a family function, because you knew this was a recurring argument, and you specifically brought it up. Finally, you say he has always been quiet and down, so he may be dealing with depression, so you being so harsh on him is likely making it worse. \n\nBasically, your lack of empathy, and insistence on how your brother \"should\" live his life is why I think you're an AH in need of a perception change.", ">Our parents are fucking idiots and that\u2019s why he\u2019s like this the best thing for him is to do is come live with me and I could get his ass in gear in a weekend \n\nYTA hot damn, you really think you are just better than your whole family don't you? I reqlly hope your brother goes NC with you, there is no way you are helping his already terrible mental state. Leave him alone.", "INFO: Was he complaining about having no money? Was he asking you for money? Was he lamenting how other people have more money than him?\n\nOh wait, no. He said he was tired. That's it. And you threw his lack of a job in his face. \n\nYes, three years is a long time. But depression is a bitch, and it can take you out. It would be great if everyone could pull themselves up by their bootstraps like you, but he clearly can't right now. And until his lack of a job starts affecting your actual life, not just just living rent-free in your head, leave him alone and support where you can.", "YTA this is not your problem and not your business. It doesn\u2019t involve you at all. You said it\u2019s a recurring argument. Why? He doesn\u2019t live with you. He doesn\u2019t owe you rent. There is absolutely no reason for this to be an argument at all. This only involves your brother and your parents NOT YOU.", "YTA. Not your place to tell him what to do. If your mom is babying him that is her problem especially if she's not complaining about it. He does sound a little immature but that response from you just because he is tired is weird. If you want to have a relationship with your brother you should come from a place of love/concern rather than trying to go at him.", "YTA. Nothing to add.", "Imagine being on such a high horse doing the bare minimum. Congratulations on having a job and going to college late i guess?\n\nYTA", "YTA. His employment status isn't any your business, and doesn't make him any less of a person.   \nWhat next, will you hit him with the famous cure all, of \"Have you tried going outside?\"   \nI've been unemployed longer, because of mental issues, so I definitely feel for your brother. I hope you'll grow out of that mindset and actually be there to support him emotionally some day.", "YTA\n\nWhatever the truth in your statement, you just didn\u2019t need to go there. Sounds like he\u2019s well aware of your views on his state of employment, and nothing about this interaction was helpful.", "YTA You should be proud of yourself for your hard work and be glad your parents weren\u2019t as easy on you. When parents baby a child, treat them as a golden child and don\u2019t have expectations for them, they don\u2019t mature and grow up. Your brother is the results. Stay in your lane and let your brother figure out his life.", "YTA not the time or place. You just wanted drama then were surprised at the drama?", "That was just a mean response, you kept bothering him about what was wrong with him and when he tells you, this was your response ? \n\nThere is a clear issue but maybe that weekend wasn't the moment to bring it up especially in the way you did. Also the fact that he left crying - according to you - might imply that the issue is slightly deeper. \n\nI understand being fed with the situation for your mom but in that situation YTA.", "Light YTA.  \n\nHas your brother tried finding jobs in his field?", "While I agree with you that your brother is an adult and, if he is not studying he should be doing something to provide for himself.\n\nI don't think it's your place to go after him if you don't support him as well, and it looks like you spoke with bad intentions here.  \n\n\nYTA", "YTA. You started the negative interaction. Why are you wasting your time? He's lazy and does nothing. Your mom allows it. You think your nasty comments will change this dynamic? No.", "YTA, but with good intentions, and pretty lightly.\n\nIt sounds like your brother is going through something, probably related to incredibly low self-esteem. Unfortunately your parents are enabling his behavior, but poking and prodding is only going to add to that. \n\nIf you want to help him/genuinely see an improvement and better everyone's situation I would sit down and be *helpful* instead of *hurtful.* You don't have to find him a job, give him money, or anything like that, however be a positive presence in his life that helps build up some confidence. Maybe find a hobby that you guys can get into that he will be good at. Bring him around your 'successful' friends and show him that whether he is productive or not, he is worth something to you and that you are not ashamed of him. As you help build up his confidence, he will learn to do it on his own and get set up for a lifetime of success.", " YTA. Your responses here show a level of cruelty that\u2019s rare even for this sub. No wonder your mother asked to you leave. You should legitimately be ashamed of yourself.", "YTA if your mom isn't pushing the issue why are you?  What you said was unnecessary and a low blow at best.  Stay in your lane.\n\nETA after seeing all your comments.  You know he's dealing with some stuff, and you choose to harp on him instead of showing any kind of empathy? Who needs enemies with family like you?  And calling him \"sensitive\" and that being the reason for him being treated differently by your parents completely invalidates all the things he's dealing with.", "YTA. Be grateful it's easy for you. Don't kick people who are down. You can't possibly think this is a smart thing to say to someone you love who probably has depression and anxiety about unemployment?\n\nYou said he's frequently like this? Perhaps it's a long term mental health issue he's dealing with. Has he seen a therapist?", "YTA\n\nIn another context I would say NTA, but I personally don't think a family event is the time or place to bring that up. IT DOES need to be discussed in the very near future though.\n\nEdit: Just to echo other commenters that passive remarks aren't going to be helpful. A conversation with your parents at some point to try and determine how to best get him going in life is probably the next step, but those specifics are above my pay grade.", "ESH you aren't wrong, sounds like he needs to get his shit together, but there's a point where calling him out in public makes it uncomfortable for everyone.", "NTA.\n\nYou are going to come up against the shut-in culture on this sub, but dude needs a job. Farting in your gaming chair ain't a life plan. \n\nIsolating yourself but for rare occasions only invites a conversation that would otherwise be better done at another time.", "NTA\n\nWhy would he get a job when mommy protects and enables him? /s\n\nOP, you've said your piece, you might as well drop it for now, because you will always be seen as the bad guy for forcing poor little brother to get a job.\n\nOnce they come back to you, complaining how he doesn't get off his ass, then you can be like \"Welp, told you so\" and saunter off in a petty galloping", "NTA\n\nThat he\u2019s this way tells me he\u2019s never been called out on it. The time for gentle guidance was a few years ago. He\u2019s on track to be in mommy\u2019s house into his 30s.", "NTA and everyone telling you it\u2019s not your business is wrong. Say he doesn\u2019t work steadily for the next 30 years, your parents are getting old or dying. You will be the one guilted into helping out your deadbeat of a brother.

I'll be downvoted, but I don't think what you said was inherently wrong, just how you said it.\n\nI get it. A deadbeat brother who doesn't do anything to help himself or contribute to the family is tired during a family event and his reason is that he was staying up playing games late into the night. Then he has the audacity to say that \"he couldn't help it\". That could make anyone in your situation irritable to hear that.

Thing is, the apology is probably a good way to start your honest conversation with him. Express how it was wrong of you to attack him the way you did and explain how frustrated it makes you feel that you see your mum struggling and that it feels like maybe he doesn't seem like he wants to help himself or his mum (if this is what you feel). I would recommend you stress that you know that is not his intention or what he wants to do to himself or his mum, but also that it is the reality of the situation right now.

Technically, your brother has a job logging with your dad. Some jobs are not regular hours or days but he is still earning money and trying. Second if logging doesn\u2019t count then are you saying your dad does not have a job either? Logging is hard labor and at least he is trying to be productive as well as in therapy. It\u2019s very obvious that you just want to feel superior based on your comments. If your parents need help that bad then they would ask or you can offer to pay them. If you aren\u2019t going to help fix the problem then keep your mouth shut because you\u2019re being incredibly cruel to embarrass and belittle your brother.

And, from your comments, I get your resentment as well - seems like there may have been unfair treatment and expectations from your mother. However, you also cannot know exactly what he\u2019s going through, and really should not comment about it in public. A huge part of maturity is learning to manage your emotions and proper behavior in different settings. That combined is learning to remove yourself if your emotions/behavior may be inappropriate for the place you are in. If you felt so strongly you felt you needed to say something, you should have removed yourself (bathroom, anyone?) until those feelings passed. \n\nNow if you do want to help him, I suggest offering to help with an application and working on it together, or maybe ask him what he likes to do and whether any of those things might be made into careers. He likes video games - maybe he wants to try programming or design? Maybe he\u2019s good at being the leader/organizer in video game campaigns - perhaps he can use those skills to become an office manager. Maybe he really cares about animals, and can do some part time work at an animal shelter. Talking him through that kindly and with compassion is generally way more effective than berating. \n\nAnd if he\u2019s still not getting a job, well, that\u2019s still none of your business to bring up in a public party - especially if he already doesn\u2019t respond well.", "YTA\n\nWhatever may have been valid about your points is massively overshadowed by your complete lack of empathy, tact, and social decency, family or not.", "YTA. 1) that is a terrible time and place to mention his employment status. 2) the job market is not the greatest place right now.

If your parents are letting this happen then you need to just drop the subject. If anything you should talk to your brother in a way that isn\u2019t telling him he needs to get a job and help your mom. Try approaching him from the perspective that your mom isn\u2019t going to be around to support him forever, he\u2019s eventually going to be at an age where living at home and being supported by his mom is going to hinder his social and romantic life, and he should try to do what he can now while he has the support from her to ensure that he won\u2019t have to struggle down the road", "I am 28 and live with my mother.

It\u2019s hard not to say something. But let me ask you - has your mom complained about your brother to you? Has she said that he\u2019s just sucking her dry, being a lazy leech, anything like that? More importantly - has she solicited your help and asked you to speak with him on the matter? If not, then this is something between your mom and your brother. She may be privy to some information about him that you are not. If she doesn\u2019t ask for help in addressing this with him, then don\u2019t make unsolicited comments. Especially not at a family gathering.\n\nAnother thing to consider - I think people focus on parents treating siblings differently. But siblings ARE different. We\u2019re all different people. We need different things. How you parent one child doesn\u2019t necessarily work with another child. Sometimes it\u2019s not a matter of treating each child equally, but rather equitably. For example, one child who struggles with severe depression and one child who doesn\u2019t. Is it \u201cfair\u201d and reasonable to treat them the same? I don\u2019t think it is. Same if one child finds school easy and the other struggles. Would it be unfair to get a tutor for the struggling child while not getting one for the child who is doing well? No, it would be silly to treat them the same in this instance because one child *needs* the tutor and the other doesn\u2019t. \n\nThis all said, I don\u2019t know your family dynamics. It\u2019s one thing if you feel in your heart that your mom would not be there for you if you had some kind of crisis, while always being there for your brother. But maybe, just maybe, he\u2019s having a crisis you are unaware of and your mom is being there for him because that\u2019s what he needs. If you\u2019ve never needed something like that from your mom, then it\u2019s comparing apples to oranges.", "You were the jerk.", "YTA your brother graduated high school in 2020. It\u2019s reasonable that his life\u2019s been a mess. Congrats on bringing that up at a family BBQ.", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not your decision if he helps with rent or gets a job. \n\nAnd telling him he\u2019d have energy if he had s job makes zero sense. That was just to start drama", "Just an FYI OP, but I was your brother back in 2021. I\u2019d finished uni and scared to find a job. I was very depressed and suicidal, every single day I suffered in silence, just wanting to die bc I hated myself. applying for full time work was so daunting. I really hope your lil bro is not the same as me. I know I too would\u2019ve cried if someone said that to me. I was fortunate enough to have family who were supportive like your mum", "YTA. like i understand the situation bc im in a v similar one, but starting drama at a family thing is just not it. esp with such a random thing to dig at him for. like yes it's frustrating but you dont control him or your mom. random digs don't help anyone.", "He might be suffering from depression.  I would worry about suicide.", "YTA. I have to say, I have a strikingly similar situation. Twin brothers who are 21Ms and I\u2019m a 23F recent college grad. Neither of my brothers went to college. One has a job currently, was previously unemployed for over a year but still lives with my mom. The other one couch surfs with friends and makes money here and there doing odd jobs with my dad. \n\nI love my brothers a lot, and I always wish they were leading more prosperous lives currently that lended well to their future. It comes from a place of care. I\u2019ve had similar rough patches with my brothers over the years urging them to get jobs, and I eventually realized it came from a place of heightened ego in myself\u2014 I was essentially urging them to be like me. I had to learn to respect that we are different people on different life paths, and that they would eventually find their way and that is a task that is most fruitful when done alone. \n\nWhen I let go of that egotistical part of myself, that viewed myself as better than my brothers, I realized that they are really happy with their lives. And from a place a love, I was able to realize that at this point that\u2019s what they needed, to feel young and free and happy. The rest will come with time, on their own time. And I\u2019m so happy that they are happy and living their lives authentically, not adhering to rigid standards that society places upon us young people. As family and support systems, we shouldn\u2019t be upping this pressure that they already feel. Once I changed my outlook in this way, our relationship improved a lot, and they do seem to take my advice more and hear me out when I say they should take more responsibility in their lives. In the past year both have started paying rent on their own. \n\nI understand how hard it can be as a big sister to take a step back and let them live unbothered. We have bothered them their whole lives. But the most respectful and loving thing you can do at this point is to be supportive, gently encouraging, and above all else, loving UNCONDITIONALLY. That is what I view as my responsibility being a big sister.\n\nEdit: I know I said YTA. I was the asshole too. You can always be less of an asshole, it hurts no one, and in this situation helps everyone.", "\"He's got a heart of gold... and friends and family who adore him\"  \n...I just wish some members of his family would recognize where he's coming from and what he's going through. OP outlined that he is depressed and receiving treatment for it.\n\nA thing I've noticed a lot with mental health issues anywhere, not just on reddit, is people clearly attach a time limit or timer to it. \"Ok, buddy. You've been mentally ill for long enough - time to shape up and deal with it\". \n\nWe've progressed enough as a society to recognize that addressing mental health MATTERS, but we still decide we get exhausted by those around us suffering from these issues if it drags on too long. This sounds like a prime example: \"he's been LIKE THIS \\[dealing with mental illness\\] for SO LONG. Why won't it just STOP already?\" Beyond that, we fail to recognize that even if someone IS pursuing treatment, often those resources actually aren't enough. Therapy is expensive. Medicine is expensive. None of that helps with job placement. Actual, tangible resources are gated by money in many cases and even when not, may still not be enough to address an individual's needs; and at a certain point, people just stop giving a shit because it's \"gone on long enough\". \n\nI'm a functioning depressive, in that I can turn on all the lights well enough to get and hold jobs and make fairly steady career advancement, but that's not something many people can do and even that comes at a personal cost to me. Everyone is on a different journey here, and it sounds like he is trying. I can't tell you how often I mask severe depressive episodes I suffer from because my internal mental feeling is \"if I talk about being down here again, my family will think 'this again? it never stops with them, does it? it's always like that!\" and wow! OP sure is reinforcing that nasty voice!\n\nMy real question to OP, though, is what on earth makes them think that laying into a sibling for the nth time at a family event will finally make them bend behaviorally? THAT is what nudges this into YTA. The fact that OP is just absolutely certain that being an absolute shit to their sibling constantly is somehow going to magically reverse all of this. Wonder if staying up all night playing video games before a family event was OP's bro's way of coping with what they knew would be a shit-awful day the second OP started in on them. Wonder if running to a room to retreat was OP's bro's way of trying to talk themselves down from something more major, knowing that again - this is a CONSTANT in their lives, hearing this from a \"successful\" sibling who can't wait to lord it over them. Yikes. What a mess.", "In the post you say \u201cI regret my response to this\u201d.  Why do you regret it?

You make their problems yours, and given it's her mother and brother, of course she's going to take interest in any of their issues. If their mother is beong overworked or stressed enough to warrant concern by OP, then it's not fair to just throw her under the bus for getting involved.\n\nAnd apparently OP mentioned that her brother was mentally disabled/challenged or had some issues like anxiety. That's great and all....but how far does that rope lead? At what point is having anxiety or some other mental illness not enough anymore, and that person needs a harsh introduction to reality? Clearly her brother needs some form of help, but if his hardship is causing the same to others, then he can't just be allowed to stagnate.", "YTA\n\nYou honestly sound jealous that your brother didn't get the same treatment as you.", "YTA.

Also, you didn't add that to your main post so I assume you know that most comments would be very one sided with that very important context.", "From your comments it sounds like your family has had some issues. You seem to have a lot of built up resentment and my guess is that there's reason for that.\n\nI will say though that in my opinion, your actions today weren't helpful at all to your brother. They were more of a release for you. You say your brother has anxiety and depression and that he's seen a therapist for this. I went through something similar at around the same age. I don't know how bad his anxiety is, but if it's anything like mine, something as easy as applying for jobs is next to impossible. I would apply for jobs, get an interview, drive to the interview, and on my way there I'd suddenly have to crap my pants. I can vividly remember this happening multiple times. Panic attacks would follow right after and I'd turn around and go home. The panic attacks I had were never around anyone else, but they were crippling. I could go on and on about it, but I'll just say that I ended up living essentially as a recluse in my parents home for about year. The depression got to the point were I was going to permanently resolve the issue were I wouldn't be here writing this response right now. Luckily, with help, I made it out.\n\nNow you might not believe your brother's issues run this deep and they may not. I will say though that with my social anxiety, I was able to talk normally or be comfortable around a small set of specific people, so if you wonder how he seems fairly normal around family and friends, this could be like my situation. Also, even if your brother isn't an angel, it's apparent that he needs help. It may also be helpful for you to seek therapy if there's a deep resentment eating you up inside. I'm not saying you're wrong for having this resentment if you feel you've been treated differently or some other reason, but it's not something you should bottle up inside. It will hurt you in the long run. \n\nLastly, I don't want to judge here but you should really think about how you feel about your brother. Most of your words come across as resentful, even hateful. If you don't really care about your brother, then you should just live your life and leave his struggles to himself and your parents. If you do care about him, bringing down the rod won't do any good. Like I said before, he may be paralyzed to move towards actions you and everyone else view as easy.  Support him and encourage him to continue with therapy. He may also want to see a behavioral psychologist specifically, as that approach worked best for me in the long run. \n\nGood luck to both of you.", "YTA.

Talk to him. Don't lecture him, don't berate him. Talk to him, talk about what holds him back, see if you can help him work through that and find something that fits his needs.

It's usually a bit physically demanding, but it's honest work, not customer facing, and the kind of thing that requires enough focus to not let your mind wander but not so much as to be mentally exhausting.\n\nThere's also some good WFH options for things like tech support and customer service, if he's comfortable on phones.", "YTA.

When I was in my early 20s I thought my brothers were just spoiled, but now I can definitely see the nuances and the reasoning behind my parents choices. I'd rather have to work and support myself then have the struggle of depression and anxiety. Or the struggle of being a high-achiever, my middle brother's life looks like my personal hell. He likes it though. Maybe OP's brother is going through shit and she's not mature or informed enough yet to understand it.", "That is literally what Equal means.

She actually held my phone hostage  as shes the executor of his estate and forced me to get a separate more expensive plan, and then refused to give me a transfer code for my phone number,forcing me to spend almost a week chasing down all my healthcare providers and government contacts for my disability with my changed number... And that was really hard on me! She weighs this interest in saving my mom money, but had asked her to babysit her son every Sunday and made my mom pay her own gas and take the day off, losing her a whole days wages to do this for her, and she is totally oblivious to this \"invisible money\" she is costing my mom while simultaneously being mad at me and infantilizeing my mom for a phone line I normally pay for myself!  She gave me some lip service today that I should be trying to be \"self sufficient\" and try to \"take care of myself\" and won't listen when I tell her my therapists and psychologists are winding me down for possible long term private care in the not too distant future for quite a few health reasons. Needless to say I am scared for my future, if my fiance and mom pass before me, since she has made it abundantly clear she does not care that I am very dependant on others for care, and always will be. I will not be able to count on her for help at all with managing my bank accounts or Dr appointments or transportation issues, etc.\n\nWith all that said, that is my anecdote, and it is not me inferring a majority are like me, but instead that each case is different. Op could or could not be like my sister, and without actual further information, we can't really know that.\n\nNot all \"quick to fledge\" 18 year olds are glass children, and not all stays home kids are neets or golden children. Not every mom and dad is an enabler. Every situation is different.", "And out of the blue, no less. Because he was sleepy.", "He's not \"do[ing] nothing.\" He's trying meds, going to therapy, and going logging with his dad when able. And the gaming with friends (and going to the family BBQ) means he's not socially isolating, which is actually a positive and can be really hard. As I mentioned in a comment above, depression isn't the same for everyone.", "OP actually stated in the comments that her brother has anxiety and depression, and is trying meds and is in therapy for it. She's fully aware that there are, in fact, deeper issues. She also has no leg to stand on as far as \"being concerned for her mother.\" Bc in response to a post saying she could help financially if this is about concern for her mother, she said she'd rather her whole family (not just brother) become homeless to learn about consequences. So extra AH.", "What she didnt mention in the post is that her brother is depressed and has anxiety and is getting treatment for it.", "I definitely agree. And, according to OP's comments, her brother has anxiety and depression, for which he is trying meds and going to therapy. So the depression isn't just something she should have considered, it's something she's fully aware of (along with the fact he's taking steps to get better). Making her an extra AH.", "If you look at OP's comments she doesn't appear to actually be concerned about her mom. It sounds like that's just an excuse. She said she'd rather her family (including her mom) become homeless than help, so they'd learn about consequences. The consequences of, apparently, trying to help their son while he goes to therapy and tries meds for his anxiety and depression. Information which she only gave in the comments.", "He has depression and anxiety and is receiving treatment for it. Seems like OP also mentioned that he had 2 jobs in the last 3 years and is sometimes helping their dad. And btw working wont stop people from playing games all night, especially on a weekend.", "You really think he meant it when he said he \u201ccouldnt help\u201d staying up? He obviously said it as a joke and didnt mean it. It was sarcastic, and not an excuse, plus it\u2019s the fucking weekend, of all days it\u2019s the weekends he is allowed to stay up in.", "Yeah great intervention. Making a cheap shot at the brother that doesnt even make sense. He is getting help for his mental health. This isnt \"enabling\".", "Depression and anxiety can be especially hard at night. By \"I couldn't help it,\" I imagine he meant it was a coping mechanism. At least he's socializing and using a coping mechanism that isn't harmful, like drugs or alcohol. And how is going to therapy (why should the mom be on his ass about it if he's already going?), trying meds, and going to work (logging) when he feels able \"genuinely [not] trying? It also doesn't say he could barely function at the BBQ, just he appeared particularly tired.\n\nAnd maybe it's just me, but personally I don't think it's natural to want to hurt someone you love (or supposedly do), especially if they're already hurting.", "OP mentioned he has depression and anxiety and is receiving treatment for it. It seems like she also mentioned that he has had 2 jobs in the last 3 years and also sometimes helps their dad. He is trying to get his shit together but OP isnt helping.", "Why is the brother def TA? Idk if you read her comments but OP mentions her brother depression and anxiety and also has worked jobs in the last 3 years.", "Brother has depression and anxiety, is receiving help and did have a job, just couldnt maintain it.", "Brother is 21. Has depression and anxiety, is getting help and did have jobs, just couldnt maintain them.", "yup and you have to find the RIGHT balance of meds so you\u2019re constantly in a state of withdrawal or transition and even WHEN you find the right cocktail, they might not work long term and you have to do it AGAIN all while feeling like complete garbage because your brain doesn\u2019t work. \n\nOP is being a complete neurotypical AH, who knows what demons brother is fighting but she didn\u2019t need to make them WORSE", "WOW.\n\nYTA.", "Or it's just OP being ableist because Brother is dealing with depression and anxiety that's keeping him from working (as she says in the comments) and OP doesn't think that's a good enough reason for him not to be working.", "You are a cruel person", "Oh wow, indeed a major AH.", "They are helping him by getting him treatment. No it is not an ESH its an YTA. Look at OPs comments. This wasnt just bad timing, she made a cheap shot at him that didnt even make sense.", "So tell me what she is going through? Her brother has depression and anxiety and is being treated for it. She just made a fucking cheap shot at him that didnt make sense. Do you really think you can help a depressed person like that?", "Like rationally you don't want to hurt someone you love, of course, but I was under the impression that most people get a spiteful urge to dig at people when they're frustrated. Siblings especially, doubly so if you don't have a great relationship. \n\nMaybe I'm a psycho lol", "Thats also how a lot of people with mental health disorders end up killing themselves.", "Guess you know him?  That isn\u2019t in the post at all. \n\nWhat is in the post is that he\u2019s 21 and spends his time playing video games, avoiding adult responsibilities, and being a surly jackass. Also, he doesn\u2019t contribute to his living at all.", "im a year younger than OPs age so for me COVID came and cut the end of my freshman year of college short, going into sophomore year. But I can attest to how miserable and hopeless that year felt as a young adult/student. I was stuck in my house unable to really go anywhere for almost a year straight. I would literally go entire weeks barely leaving my room or saying anything out loud. I as a 6\u20191\u201d guy went from being like 170 lbs with lots of muscle to 138 lbs at the lowest out of pure depression. I didnt feel like myself. When I got back to college I legitimately struggled socializing and it took me like a month to feel normal again.\n\nI cant imagine how it must have felt for the people younger than me who couldn\u2019t even properly graduate. My senior year of HS was the best stretch of my time in school by far, and I feel lucky to have missed COVID by just a year", "It's possible the brother has struggles op doesn't know about - and given op's attitude I see why she isn't privvy to his private medical info. \n\nHis behavior is not indicative of a spoiled/entitled person.  If he honestly is that exhausted there's likely something medically wrong and I know from experience it may not be easy to get diagnosed/treated.\n\nIt seems like he really wants to be useful and is struggling to cope with how his life is turning out.", "Exactly! There's no mention of any harshness from the mother towards her.", "I want to reply to this thread to remember it, the last few years have been rough. Remember to take a break if the job search itself is burning you out too. Burning out will make it a lot harder to do whatever job you get.", "I lost my health insurance so Im currently not medicated and I cry a few times a day. I get so frustrated with my inability to accomplish anything and I can\u2019t deal. I feel bad for OPs brother.", "I strongly agree with what you\u2019re saying, but something tells me from OP\u2019s tone that she knows much too little about depression to help him with it, over lunch or otherwise.\n\nHer diligent attitude about self-reliance early on has given her successes that helped her not to succumb to situational depression and otherwise her young age (23) makes it unlikely she has absorbed through osmosis an understanding of the debilitating nature of depression.\n\nYounger brother definitely knows way more about this stuff than she does. But she can still offer her support in other ways.", "That's bleak.", "I\u2019m 20 and graduated in 2021. It was horrible. I had no friends and was stuck at home with no resources to deal with my mental illness. I them proceeded to get long covid right around when I started uni. I am struggling to find work as well.\nThose of us who\u2019ve had to graduate through COVID are having a horrible time.", "Yeah and this also has to do with the parents too.\nA good example is I stayed at my dad's home through most of my schooling so I could focus on getting the rhythm in my accelerated MS program. Then you ask my stepmother and she was raised differently. She said she had no right and wouldn't have dreamed of telling me dad to push me out of the nest because she wasn't my mom and felt she had no right. But in her family, everyone left at 18. She plans to have her 3 kids(my half-brothers) move out at 18 as well. My dad's family was the type to only move out once you're married and secure a home loan. \n\nTo be honest, she said \"my dad\" and \"my mom's house\" and \"our mom\" but I'm wondering if maybe this is a half sibling situation as well? Or perhaps the parents helped OP secure an apartment for school and to stay in after she graduates because she'd already been working. Until OP clarifies any of that, anything we really say is just discussion on theories.\nIdk, I'm mostly nailing that down on her saying \"my mom's house\" instead of \"my parents' house.\"", "Yeah but asking people to think rationally while frustrated and hurt is like asking for disappointment. I think the whole \u2018it\u2019s not my fault I\u2019m the favourite\u2019 thing is a massive cop out on the part of the golden child.", "Cause they drop into queues in an order and the timing can matter on who is read first and with more care or even at all", "The son, because he's actually in the house and is available to talk to, rather than the callous daughter that hasn't lived there for years and resents not being the center of attention.", "Have you tried being kind to him and being on his side?\n\nI'm not trying to pile on, a lot of people in this thread have that well in hand, but it seems like the only reason this bothers you is that you have a job and he doesn't and you feel that's unfair. Like, if he got a job that made him miserable every day, you'd be happy because the unfairness problem has been solved.\n\nMaybe if he felt like the reason you wanted to him to get a job was because you love him and want what is best for him, he'd probably be a lot more open to listening to you.", "Your \"help\" is a net-negative contribution to his welfare, and you know it. YTA.", "This is not enabling. What a surprise, someone with mental health issues cant hold down a job? Treatment for mental health takes time and wont just disappear. Doing nothing would be not getting treatment for his problems.", "The only case in which OP would have full right to do that would be if she lived with the parents and the brother and she had to pay rent and do chores and he didn't.\n\nBut OP lives on her own. She's not involved with those three people in any way. She basically has no reason to be frustrated.\n\nAnd trust me, going to gym drains your energy. As it should. If it doesn't, you drink too much energy drinks and exercise too little.\n\nTo the last point - that will probably teach the brother to start working finally.", "I agree. Different people have different needs. Sounds like mom is just in time with her kids needs.\n\nI have cats and a dog. I spend way more time with the dog than any of the cats. Does it mean I treat the dog better? No. She just needs constant contact. The cats don't need or want constant contact, and come let me know when they're ready for attention, and even there, all the cats have varying needs.\n\nHumans are the same way, only their needs are greater in a lot of ways. Her brother graduated 3 years ago. The start of a freaking pandemic. When nowhere was hiring. I don't know how situation at all, but I can imagine working so hard at getting an education and then the freaking country shutting down so you can't do anything with it is plenty enough to send someone into depression. And that's just best case scenario assuming he didn't already have issues going on. \n\nI agree it's likely he's going through some shit op doesn't know about, and likely isn't even interested in, and mom is atune to his needs and trying to help her kids through a hard time.", "Your parents actually sound pretty unfair to you for this. You had to immediately get a job as soon as you could, but both of their sons got supported by them well into adulthood?", "So if you do it at 3am instead of 9am then you're earlier in the queue, problem solved.", "My brother took forever to \"grow up\". Didn't start working consistently until his mid 20s.\n\nHe told me he thinks he might be autistic, or like me, have ADHD, something undiagnosed anyway.\n\nAnd it would totally make sense. Things like that literally delay maturity. You don't pay attention to your peers like you should, and you learn how to behave from your peers.", "That was my thought, and if he does have something going on, she would clearly attack him over it in a public forum... like she did here.", "Sometimes you're buried because reverse queues\n\nBut honestly I do mine whenever. Just thinking of some of the weirdernwdgivr given in my too long anyone in being unemployed.\n\nEdit: codicil: as with all things this is likely to depend on locale, job area, who's reading etc nothing is sensible xd", "You guys made every fiction under the sun to defend the brat who doesn't try to get a job and plays all night on his console so he is not in a state to behave properly in family gatherings? \n\nWhy?"]}
