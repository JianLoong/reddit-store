There is help out there.", "> but I said, \"Maybe you\u2019d have more energy if you had a job.\" \n\nThis right here is a cheap shot and doesn't even make sense, not to mention a drama starter. Can't blame your mom for asking you to leave. You tout that you've had a job since high school, go to school currently, and live on your own, yet here you are starting unnecessary, childish drama at a family BBQ.\n\n\nYTA. You are taking a problem that has nothing to do with you, and making it your problem. Comments like that are not going to help him. He's an adult, his job situation is his to deal with, and if he's not paying rent to your mom, that's up to your mom to sort out. I also think you are not accounting for details you may be unaware of here, like if he may be dealing with some mental health issues or other problems in his life.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your place to shame him. If your parents have an issue with him not paying rent or his lack of employment, they can talk to him. It\u2019s not your place. If all the poking and prodding hasn\u2019t worked before, you\u2019re just beating a dead horse. A family bbq for the holiday isn\u2019t the time nor place for such shaming anyway.", "YTA. sounds like you feel superior to your brother because you\u2019ve kept a job, moved out and go to school. you should understand that every one\u2019s path is different and if you feel so bad about your mother being overworked and paying rent maybe you should help her out instead of complaining that other people don\u2019t.", "What a trash sister. If you are so concerned about him not having a steady job and him not helping to pay rent, you pay it instead and help him find a job instead of berating him", "YTA - if you were concerned about his well being, this wasn\u2019t how to help him.", "YTA. He was tired. You took it too far. If you want to talk to your brother about him not having a job and checking in on him do it in private.", "YTA. You obviously resent the hell out of your brother, but that's a \"you\" problem. Bullying him at a family bbq isn't going to pay your mother's rent. Honestly it sounds like he has depression. Regardless, it sounds like there's no indication that anyone resents him except you, and I'm sure your mother is quite capable of speaking for herself. So stay out of it, and skip the family gatherings until you can at least be in your brother's presence without picking on him.", "In your comments you say that your brother has anxiety, depression, is on meds, and is in therapy. Clearly, he is struggling (probably more than you know) and trying to manage life the best he can as a 20-year-old. \n\nI'm not sure why you feel the need to insert yourself into any of this, to be honest. Seems kind of like you enjoy comparing yourself to him and try to make him feel beneath you. The fact that you chose to hound him about this (something that really is none of your business) in front of others was totally out of line. \n\nYTA. You owe your brother an apology. He needs encouragement and support, not condescending lectures and scoldings.", "YTA. Sounds like your brother's probably going through some shit, and what you said was totally unnecessary and cruel.", "You just sound like a snob tbh", "YTA. Yes a job would be good but that was a weird time to bring it up, and on what planet does a job give you more energy? Seems like just an excuse to scold. Plus the extra tired/down vibe could be from already dreading the social event.\n\nHe sounds like he needs help though.\n\nEdit: wait did you do this *at* the BBQ?? Or right before?", "YTA. Is he asking your for money? Has he negatively impacted your parents finances? It\u2019s not your circus, why are you petting their monkeys? Live and let live. They\u2019re making it work, mind your business. Down the road if things haven\u2019t changed, sit them down and explain that you accept no financial responsibility for your brother should something happen to them, so they need to prepare and make alternate plans. Realistically, he will probably figure it out before that and finally \u2018launch\u2019. Don\u2019t ruin any potential relationship for the figure with misguided behavior now.", "YTA. Firstly, your aggressive push for independence was your journey, not his, so telling him that he needs to act a specific way is both rude and none of your business. Secondly, you instigated a fight at a family function, because you knew this was a recurring argument, and you specifically brought it up. Finally, you say he has always been quiet and down, so he may be dealing with depression, so you being so harsh on him is likely making it worse. \n\nBasically, your lack of empathy, and insistence on how your brother \"should\" live his life is why I think you're an AH in need of a perception change.", ">Our parents are fucking idiots and that\u2019s why he\u2019s like this the best thing for him is to do is come live with me and I could get his ass in gear in a weekend \n\nYTA hot damn, you really think you are just better than your whole family don't you? I reqlly hope your brother goes NC with you, there is no way you are helping his already terrible mental state. Leave him alone.", "INFO: Was he complaining about having no money? Was he asking you for money? Was he lamenting how other people have more money than him?\n\nOh wait, no. He said he was tired. That's it. And you threw his lack of a job in his face. \n\nYes, three years is a long time. But depression is a bitch, and it can take you out. It would be great if everyone could pull themselves up by their bootstraps like you, but he clearly can't right now. And until his lack of a job starts affecting your actual life, not just just living rent-free in your head, leave him alone and support where you can.", "YTA this is not your problem and not your business. It doesn\u2019t involve you at all. You said it\u2019s a recurring argument. Why? He doesn\u2019t live with you. He doesn\u2019t owe you rent. There is absolutely no reason for this to be an argument at all. This only involves your brother and your parents NOT YOU.", "YTA. Not your place to tell him what to do. If your mom is babying him that is her problem especially if she's not complaining about it. He does sound a little immature but that response from you just because he is tired is weird. If you want to have a relationship with your brother you should come from a place of love/concern rather than trying to go at him.", "YTA. Nothing to add.", "Imagine being on such a high horse doing the bare minimum. Congratulations on having a job and going to college late i guess?\n\nYTA", "YTA. His employment status isn't any your business, and doesn't make him any less of a person.   \nWhat next, will you hit him with the famous cure all, of \"Have you tried going outside?\"   \nI've been unemployed longer, because of mental issues, so I definitely feel for your brother. I hope you'll grow out of that mindset and actually be there to support him emotionally some day.", "YTA\n\nWhatever the truth in your statement, you just didn\u2019t need to go there. Sounds like he\u2019s well aware of your views on his state of employment, and nothing about this interaction was helpful.", "YTA You should be proud of yourself for your hard work and be glad your parents weren\u2019t as easy on you. When parents baby a child, treat them as a golden child and don\u2019t have expectations for them, they don\u2019t mature and grow up. Your brother is the results. Stay in your lane and let your brother figure out his life.", "YTA not the time or place. You just wanted drama then were surprised at the drama?", "That was just a mean response, you kept bothering him about what was wrong with him and when he tells you, this was your response ? \n\nThere is a clear issue but maybe that weekend wasn't the moment to bring it up especially in the way you did. Also the fact that he left crying - according to you - might imply that the issue is slightly deeper. \n\nI understand being fed with the situation for your mom but in that situation YTA.", "Light YTA.  \n\nHas your brother tried finding jobs in his field?", "While I agree with you that your brother is an adult and, if he is not studying he should be doing something to provide for himself.\n\nI don't think it's your place to go after him if you don't support him as well, and it looks like you spoke with bad intentions here.  \n\n\nYTA", "YTA. You started the negative interaction. Why are you wasting your time? He's lazy and does nothing. Your mom allows it. You think your nasty comments will change this dynamic? No.", "YTA, but with good intentions, and pretty lightly.\n\nIt sounds like your brother is going through something, probably related to incredibly low self-esteem. Unfortunately your parents are enabling his behavior, but poking and prodding is only going to add to that. \n\nIf you want to help him/genuinely see an improvement and better everyone's situation I would sit down and be *helpful* instead of *hurtful.* You don't have to find him a job, give him money, or anything like that, however be a positive presence in his life that helps build up some confidence. Maybe find a hobby that you guys can get into that he will be good at. Bring him around your 'successful' friends and show him that whether he is productive or not, he is worth something to you and that you are not ashamed of him. As you help build up his confidence, he will learn to do it on his own and get set up for a lifetime of success.", " YTA. Your responses here show a level of cruelty that\u2019s rare even for this sub. No wonder your mother asked to you leave. You should legitimately be ashamed of yourself.", "YTA if your mom isn't pushing the issue why are you?  What you said was unnecessary and a low blow at best.  Stay in your lane.\n\nETA after seeing all your comments.  You know he's dealing with some stuff, and you choose to harp on him instead of showing any kind of empathy? Who needs enemies with family like you?  And calling him \"sensitive\" and that being the reason for him being treated differently by your parents completely invalidates all the things he's dealing with.", "YTA. Be grateful it's easy for you. Don't kick people who are down. You can't possibly think this is a smart thing to say to someone you love who probably has depression and anxiety about unemployment?\n\nYou said he's frequently like this? Perhaps it's a long term mental health issue he's dealing with. Has he seen a therapist?", "YTA\n\nIn another context I would say NTA, but I personally don't think a family event is the time or place to bring that up. IT DOES need to be discussed in the very near future though.\n\nEdit: Just to echo other commenters that passive remarks aren't going to be helpful. A conversation with your parents at some point to try and determine how to best get him going in life is probably the next step, but those specifics are above my pay grade.", "ESH you aren't wrong, sounds like he needs to get his shit together, but there's a point where calling him out in public makes it uncomfortable for everyone.", "NTA.\n\nYou are going to come up against the shut-in culture on this sub, but dude needs a job.

The time for gentle guidance was a few years ago. He\u2019s on track to be in mommy\u2019s house into his 30s.", "NTA and everyone telling you it\u2019s not your business is wrong. Say he doesn\u2019t work steadily for the next 30 years, your parents are getting old or dying. You will be the one guilted into helping out your deadbeat of a brother.

And by the way you treat him I can clearly make out why he doesn't feel comfortable to share with you. Sorry but YTA here. Just because you have job doesn't make it appropriate to look down upon him. Either sympathise with him, help him or leave him alone.", "Did you ever stop to think that they're soft on him because he's (quite clearly) going through some shit?", "I feel you - it's not fair they're not as hard on him as they were on you, but look at your achievements so far!  You have to make peace with this sense of injustice and move on. It's up to your parents to educate and guide him, and not really your concern. I do agree they're not doing him any favors by letting him be so dependent / not encouraging him to be more self-sufficient. Even people with issues need to find coping mechanisms to get through adulthood. \n\nSoft YTA for calling him out in such a public way and revealing your resentment.", "I\u2019m talking about you and you only. Not your parents", "For starters, simply telling your brother to *\"get a job\"* isn't even a little bit helpful.\n\nIf you want to be helpful, maybe have an actual conversation with him--instead of lecturing him and trying to make him feel guilty and inadequate--about different jobs he might be interested in or what sorts of things he can picture himself doing. Maybe you could point out what strengths he has and what good qualities he possesses. Maybe you could help him put together a resume. Maybe you could help him by looking at different ads/places with him that are hiring. Maybe you could help him by offering to give him tips on how to fill out an application and sit down with him to do exactly that. \n\nBut simply telling someone to \"get a job\" is as helpful as telling someone with depression to \"snap out of it\" and \"smile,\" or telling someone with anxiety to \"stop worrying.\"", "Ok but they are the parents and that\u2019s their parenting choice. You are not his parent. You have every right to be frustrated but you can\u2019t change their choices and it\u2019s simply inappropriate for you to try to parent him.", "You are mixing up intention and action.\n\nIs her goal for her brother to be independent, for her mother's stress to go down, and for him to live a happier life? **Yes.** *Those are good intentions.*\n\nAre her actions in trying to reach that goal suitable, nurturing, and appropriate? **No.** *Those are bad actions.*\n\nSorry, but you will never be right that she has bad *intentions* unless her goal is to *only* hurt him.\n\nEdit: Go ahead and downvote me, but it's the truth. Her actions were horrible, but her intentions were good. She wants better for her brother, that's that. She hasn't stated once that she wants her brother to vanish from the family and she doesn't give AF about him or his future. She has stated the complete opposite. Your feelings about her actions doesn't change that she has good intentions.", "Unfortunately there are tons of bad therapists out there. My very narcissistic mom has a therapist, and the *one* time I went with her it was very clear that he was getting a paycheck by feeding her ego. She will go to him until she dies because he reinforces that she is amazing even though she beat her kids and severely emotionally neglected them.", "It\u2019s different for everyone straight talk works extremely well for me but not him I just forget that sometimes", "She knows, she just doesn't care.", "It\u2019s gonna have to be me and me only cause my parents won\u2019t do shit", "Our parents are fucking idiots and that\u2019s why he\u2019s like this the best thing for him is to do is come live with me and I could get his ass in gear in a weekend", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s like for my brother he told my mom that it\u2019s nice having someone to talk too that\u2019s an unbiased source. But I\u2019m worried that not actually treatment is happening.", "There's a difference between straight talk, and putting someone down to seem superior yourself. You know that too.", "Oh, I can tell. But I'm trying to drive the point home.", "Sounds like you don\u2019t even care to or it\u2019s not genuine help at all. You just find it nice to ridicule him about it.", "Lmfao holy shit YTA", "You\u2019re so self righteous it\u2019s disgusting", "You would send him into a tailspin and probably into an inpatient psychiatric hospital", "It's very possible and very probable that him doing so would is a maladaptive form of building *false* confidence because he doesn't have anything solid in his life to build true confidence. The more ways you find to help your brother build true confidence, the more you can diminish any maladaptive habits that he used out of desperation.", "100% seems like what's happening.", "It\u2019s hard not too he\u2019ll never improve himself with the way my parents are handling him and if I don\u2019t no one else will", "That\u2019s not your job to do."]}
