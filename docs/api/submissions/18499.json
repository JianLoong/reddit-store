There is help out there.", "> but I said, \"Maybe you\u2019d have more energy if you had a job.\" \n\nThis right here is a cheap shot and doesn't even make sense, not to mention a drama starter. Can't blame your mom for asking you to leave. You tout that you've had a job since high school, go to school currently, and live on your own, yet here you are starting unnecessary, childish drama at a family BBQ.\n\n\nYTA. You are taking a problem that has nothing to do with you, and making it your problem. Comments like that are not going to help him. He's an adult, his job situation is his to deal with, and if he's not paying rent to your mom, that's up to your mom to sort out. I also think you are not accounting for details you may be unaware of here, like if he may be dealing with some mental health issues or other problems in his life.", "YTA. It\u2019s not your place to shame him. If your parents have an issue with him not paying rent or his lack of employment, they can talk to him. It\u2019s not your place. If all the poking and prodding hasn\u2019t worked before, you\u2019re just beating a dead horse. A family bbq for the holiday isn\u2019t the time nor place for such shaming anyway.", "YTA. sounds like you feel superior to your brother because you\u2019ve kept a job, moved out and go to school. you should understand that every one\u2019s path is different and if you feel so bad about your mother being overworked and paying rent maybe you should help her out instead of complaining that other people don\u2019t.", "What a trash sister. If you are so concerned about him not having a steady job and him not helping to pay rent, you pay it instead and help him find a job instead of berating him", "YTA - if you were concerned about his well being, this wasn\u2019t how to help him.", "YTA. He was tired. You took it too far. If you want to talk to your brother about him not having a job and checking in on him do it in private.", "YTA. You obviously resent the hell out of your brother, but that's a \"you\" problem. Bullying him at a family bbq isn't going to pay your mother's rent. Honestly it sounds like he has depression. Regardless, it sounds like there's no indication that anyone resents him except you, and I'm sure your mother is quite capable of speaking for herself. So stay out of it, and skip the family gatherings until you can at least be in your brother's presence without picking on him.", "In your comments you say that your brother has anxiety, depression, is on meds, and is in therapy. Clearly, he is struggling (probably more than you know) and trying to manage life the best he can as a 21-year-old. \n\nI'm not sure why you feel the need to insert yourself into any of this, to be honest. Seems kind of like you enjoy comparing yourself to him and try to make him feel beneath you. The fact that you chose to hound him about this (something that really is none of your business) in front of others was totally out of line. \n\nYTA. You owe your brother an apology. He needs encouragement and support, not condescending lectures and scoldings.", "YTA. Sounds like your brother's probably going through some shit, and what you said was totally unnecessary and cruel.", "You just sound like a snob tbh", "YTA. Yes a job would be good but that was a weird time to bring it up, and on what planet does a job give you more energy? Seems like just an excuse to scold. Plus the extra tired/down vibe could be from already dreading the social event.\n\nHe sounds like he needs help though.\n\nEdit: wait did you do this *at* the BBQ?? Or right before?", "YTA. Is he asking your for money? Has he negatively impacted your parents finances? It\u2019s not your circus, why are you petting their monkeys? Live and let live. They\u2019re making it work, mind your business. Down the road if things haven\u2019t changed, sit them down and explain that you accept no financial responsibility for your brother should something happen to them, so they need to prepare and make alternate plans. Realistically, he will probably figure it out before that and finally \u2018launch\u2019. Don\u2019t ruin any potential relationship for the figure with misguided behavior now.", "YTA. Firstly, your aggressive push for independence was your journey, not his, so telling him that he needs to act a specific way is both rude and none of your business. Secondly, you instigated a fight at a family function, because you knew this was a recurring argument, and you specifically brought it up. Finally, you say he has always been quiet and down, so he may be dealing with depression, so you being so harsh on him is likely making it worse. \n\nBasically, your lack of empathy, and insistence on how your brother \"should\" live his life is why I think you're an AH in need of a perception change.", ">Our parents are fucking idiots and that\u2019s why he\u2019s like this the best thing for him is to do is come live with me and I could get his ass in gear in a weekend \n\nYTA hot damn, you really think you are just better than your whole family don't you? I reqlly hope your brother goes NC with you, there is no way you are helping his already terrible mental state. Leave him alone.", "INFO: Was he complaining about having no money? Was he asking you for money? Was he lamenting how other people have more money than him?\n\nOh wait, no. He said he was tired. That's it. And you threw his lack of a job in his face. \n\nYes, three years is a long time. But depression is a bitch, and it can take you out. It would be great if everyone could pull themselves up by their bootstraps like you, but he clearly can't right now. And until his lack of a job starts affecting your actual life, not just just living rent-free in your head, leave him alone and support where you can.", "YTA this is not your problem and not your business. It doesn\u2019t involve you at all. You said it\u2019s a recurring argument. Why? He doesn\u2019t live with you. He doesn\u2019t owe you rent. There is absolutely no reason for this to be an argument at all. This only involves your brother and your parents NOT YOU.", "YTA. Not your place to tell him what to do. If your mom is babying him that is her problem especially if she's not complaining about it. He does sound a little immature but that response from you just because he is tired is weird. If you want to have a relationship with your brother you should come from a place of love/concern rather than trying to go at him.", "YTA. Nothing to add.", "Imagine being on such a high horse doing the bare minimum. Congratulations on having a job and going to college late i guess?\n\nYTA", "YTA. His employment status isn't any your business, and doesn't make him any less of a person.   \nWhat next, will you hit him with the famous cure all, of \"Have you tried going outside?\"   \nI've been unemployed longer, because of mental issues, so I definitely feel for your brother. I hope you'll grow out of that mindset and actually be there to support him emotionally some day.", "YTA\n\nWhatever the truth in your statement, you just didn\u2019t need to go there. Sounds like he\u2019s well aware of your views on his state of employment, and nothing about this interaction was helpful.", "YTA You should be proud of yourself for your hard work and be glad your parents weren\u2019t as easy on you. When parents baby a child, treat them as a golden child and don\u2019t have expectations for them, they don\u2019t mature and grow up. Your brother is the results. Stay in your lane and let your brother figure out his life.", "YTA not the time or place. You just wanted drama then were surprised at the drama?", "That was just a mean response, you kept bothering him about what was wrong with him and when he tells you, this was your response ? \n\nThere is a clear issue but maybe that weekend wasn't the moment to bring it up especially in the way you did. Also the fact that he left crying - according to you - might imply that the issue is slightly deeper. \n\nI understand being fed with the situation for your mom but in that situation YTA.", "Light YTA.  \n\nHas your brother tried finding jobs in his field?", "While I agree with you that your brother is an adult and, if he is not studying he should be doing something to provide for himself.\n\nI don't think it's your place to go after him if you don't support him as well, and it looks like you spoke with bad intentions here.  \n\n\nYTA", "YTA. You started the negative interaction. Why are you wasting your time? He's lazy and does nothing. Your mom allows it. You think your nasty comments will change this dynamic? No.", "YTA, but with good intentions, and pretty lightly.\n\nIt sounds like your brother is going through something, probably related to incredibly low self-esteem. Unfortunately your parents are enabling his behavior, but poking and prodding is only going to add to that. \n\nIf you want to help him/genuinely see an improvement and better everyone's situation I would sit down and be *helpful* instead of *hurtful.* You don't have to find him a job, give him money, or anything like that, however be a positive presence in his life that helps build up some confidence. Maybe find a hobby that you guys can get into that he will be good at. Bring him around your 'successful' friends and show him that whether he is productive or not, he is worth something to you and that you are not ashamed of him. As you help build up his confidence, he will learn to do it on his own and get set up for a lifetime of success.", " YTA. Your responses here show a level of cruelty that\u2019s rare even for this sub. No wonder your mother asked to you leave. You should legitimately be ashamed of yourself.", "YTA if your mom isn't pushing the issue why are you?  What you said was unnecessary and a low blow at best.  Stay in your lane.\n\nETA after seeing all your comments.  You know he's dealing with some stuff, and you choose to harp on him instead of showing any kind of empathy? Who needs enemies with family like you?  And calling him \"sensitive\" and that being the reason for him being treated differently by your parents completely invalidates all the things he's dealing with.", "YTA. Be grateful it's easy for you. Don't kick people who are down. You can't possibly think this is a smart thing to say to someone you love who probably has depression and anxiety about unemployment?\n\nYou said he's frequently like this? Perhaps it's a long term mental health issue he's dealing with. Has he seen a therapist?", "YTA\n\nIn another context I would say NTA, but I personally don't think a family event is the time or place to bring that up. IT DOES need to be discussed in the very near future though.\n\nEdit: Just to echo other commenters that passive remarks aren't going to be helpful. A conversation with your parents at some point to try and determine how to best get him going in life is probably the next step, but those specifics are above my pay grade.", "ESH you aren't wrong, sounds like he needs to get his shit together, but there's a point where calling him out in public makes it uncomfortable for everyone.", "NTA.\n\nYou are going to come up against the shut-in culture on this sub, but dude needs a job. Farting in your gaming chair ain't a life plan. \n\nIsolating yourself but for rare occasions only invites a conversation that would otherwise be better done at another time.", "NTA\n\nWhy would he get a job when mommy protects and enables him? /s\n\nOP, you've said your piece, you might as well drop it for now, because you will always be seen as the bad guy for forcing poor little brother to get a job.\n\nOnce they come back to you, complaining how he doesn't get off his ass, then you can be like \"Welp, told you so\" and saunter off in a petty galloping", "NTA\n\nThat he\u2019s this way tells me he\u2019s never been called out on it. The time for gentle guidance was a few years ago. He\u2019s on track to be in mommy\u2019s house into his 30s.", "NTA and everyone telling you it\u2019s not your business is wrong. Say he doesn\u2019t work steadily for the next 30 years, your parents are getting old or dying. You will be the one guilted into helping out your deadbeat of a brother.

A deadbeat brother who doesn't do anything to help himself or contribute to the family is tired during a family event and his reason is that he was staying up playing games late into the night. Then he has the audacity to say that \"he couldn't help it\". That could make anyone in your situation irritable to hear that.

Technically, your brother has a job logging with your dad. Some jobs are not regular hours or days but he is still earning money and trying. Second if logging doesn\u2019t count then are you saying your dad does not have a job either? Logging is hard labor and at least he is trying to be productive as well as in therapy.

However, you also cannot know exactly what he\u2019s going through, and really should not comment about it in public. A huge part of maturity is learning to manage your emotions and proper behavior in different settings. That combined is learning to remove yourself if your emotions/behavior may be inappropriate for the place you are in. If you felt so strongly you felt you needed to say something, you should have removed yourself (bathroom, anyone?) until those feelings passed. \n\nNow if you do want to help him, I suggest offering to help with an application and working on it together, or maybe ask him what he likes to do and whether any of those things might be made into careers.

She may be privy to some information about him that you are not. If she doesn\u2019t ask for help in addressing this with him, then don\u2019t make unsolicited comments. Especially not at a family gathering.\n\nAnother thing to consider - I think people focus on parents treating siblings differently. But siblings ARE different. We\u2019re all different people. We need different things. How you parent one child doesn\u2019t necessarily work with another child. Sometimes it\u2019s not a matter of treating each child equally, but rather equitably. For example, one child who struggles with severe depression and one child who doesn\u2019t. Is it \u201cfair\u201d and reasonable to treat them the same? I don\u2019t think it is. Same if one child finds school easy and the other struggles. Would it be unfair to get a tutor for the struggling child while not getting one for the child who is doing well? No, it would be silly to treat them the same in this instance because one child *needs* the tutor and the other doesn\u2019t. \n\nThis all said, I don\u2019t know your family dynamics. It\u2019s one thing if you feel in your heart that your mom would not be there for you if you had some kind of crisis, while always being there for your brother. But maybe, just maybe, he\u2019s having a crisis you are unaware of and your mom is being there for him because that\u2019s what he needs. If you\u2019ve never needed something like that from your mom, then it\u2019s comparing apples to oranges.", "You were the jerk.", "YTA your brother graduated high school in 2020. It\u2019s reasonable that his life\u2019s been a mess. Congrats on bringing that up at a family BBQ.", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s not your decision if he helps with rent or gets a job. \n\nAnd telling him he\u2019d have energy if he had s job makes zero sense. That was just to start drama", "Just an FYI OP, but I was your brother back in 2021. I\u2019d finished uni and scared to find a job. I was very depressed and suicidal, every single day I suffered in silence, just wanting to die bc I hated myself. applying for full time work was so daunting. I really hope your lil bro is not the same as me. I know I too would\u2019ve cried if someone said that to me.

I would worry about suicide.", "YTA. I have to say, I have a strikingly similar situation. Twin brothers who are 21Ms and I\u2019m a 23F recent college grad. Neither of my brothers went to college. One has a job currently, was previously unemployed for over a year but still lives with my mom. The other one couch surfs with friends and makes money here and there doing odd jobs with my dad. \n\nI love my brothers a lot, and I always wish they were leading more prosperous lives currently that lended well to their future. It comes from a place of care. I\u2019ve had similar rough patches with my brothers over the years urging them to get jobs, and I eventually realized it came from a place of heightened ego in myself\u2014 I was essentially urging them to be like me. I had to learn to respect that we are different people on different life paths, and that they would eventually find their way and that is a task that is most fruitful when done alone. \n\nWhen I let go of that egotistical part of myself, that viewed myself as better than my brothers, I realized that they are really happy with their lives. And from a place a love, I was able to realize that at this point that\u2019s what they needed, to feel young and free and happy. The rest will come with time, on their own time. And I\u2019m so happy that they are happy and living their lives authentically, not adhering to rigid standards that society places upon us young people. As family and support systems, we shouldn\u2019t be upping this pressure that they already feel. Once I changed my outlook in this way, our relationship improved a lot, and they do seem to take my advice more and hear me out when I say they should take more responsibility in their lives. In the past year both have started paying rent on their own. \n\nI understand how hard it can be as a big sister to take a step back and let them live unbothered. We have bothered them their whole lives. But the most respectful and loving thing you can do at this point is to be supportive, gently encouraging, and above all else, loving UNCONDITIONALLY. That is what I view as my responsibility being a big sister.\n\nEdit: I know I said YTA. I was the asshole too. You can always be less of an asshole, it hurts no one, and in this situation helps everyone.", "\"He's got a heart of gold... and friends and family who adore him\"  \n...I just wish some members of his family would recognize where he's coming from and what he's going through. OP outlined that he is depressed and receiving treatment for it.\n\nA thing I've noticed a lot with mental health issues anywhere, not just on reddit, is people clearly attach a time limit or timer to it. \"Ok, buddy. You've been mentally ill for long enough - time to shape up and deal with it\". \n\nWe've progressed enough as a society to recognize that addressing mental health MATTERS, but we still decide we get exhausted by those around us suffering from these issues if it drags on too long. This sounds like a prime example: \"he's been LIKE THIS \\[dealing with mental illness\\] for SO LONG. Why won't it just STOP already?\" Beyond that, we fail to recognize that even if someone IS pursuing treatment, often those resources actually aren't enough. Therapy is expensive. Medicine is expensive. None of that helps with job placement. Actual, tangible resources are gated by money in many cases and even when not, may still not be enough to address an individual's needs; and at a certain point, people just stop giving a shit because it's \"gone on long enough\". \n\nI'm a functioning depressive, in that I can turn on all the lights well enough to get and hold jobs and make fairly steady career advancement, but that's not something many people can do and even that comes at a personal cost to me. Everyone is on a different journey here, and it sounds like he is trying. I can't tell you how often I mask severe depressive episodes I suffer from because my internal mental feeling is \"if I talk about being down here again, my family will think 'this again? it never stops with them, does it? it's always like that!\" and wow! OP sure is reinforcing that nasty voice!\n\nMy real question to OP, though, is what on earth makes them think that laying into a sibling for the nth time at a family event will finally make them bend behaviorally? THAT is what nudges this into YTA. The fact that OP is just absolutely certain that being an absolute shit to their sibling constantly is somehow going to magically reverse all of this. Wonder if staying up all night playing video games before a family event was OP's bro's way of coping with what they knew would be a shit-awful day the second OP started in on them. Wonder if running to a room to retreat was OP's bro's way of trying to talk themselves down from something more major, knowing that again - this is a CONSTANT in their lives, hearing this from a \"successful\" sibling who can't wait to lord it over them.

You make their problems yours, and given it's her mother and brother, of course she's going to take interest in any of their issues. If their mother is beong overworked or stressed enough to warrant concern by OP, then it's not fair to just throw her under the bus for getting involved.\n\nAnd apparently OP mentioned that her brother was mentally disabled/challenged or had some issues like anxiety. That's great and all....but how far does that rope lead? At what point is having anxiety or some other mental illness not enough anymore, and that person needs a harsh introduction to reality?

Also, you didn't add that to your main post so I assume you know that most comments would be very one sided with that very important context.", "From your comments it sounds like your family has had some issues. You seem to have a lot of built up resentment and my guess is that there's reason for that.\n\nI will say though that in my opinion, your actions today weren't helpful at all to your brother. They were more of a release for you. You say your brother has anxiety and depression and that he's seen a therapist for this. I went through something similar at around the same age. I don't know how bad his anxiety is, but if it's anything like mine, something as easy as applying for jobs is next to impossible. I would apply for jobs, get an interview, drive to the interview, and on my way there I'd suddenly have to crap my pants. I can vividly remember this happening multiple times. Panic attacks would follow right after and I'd turn around and go home. The panic attacks I had were never around anyone else, but they were crippling. I could go on and on about it, but I'll just say that I ended up living essentially as a recluse in my parents home for about year. The depression got to the point were I was going to permanently resolve the issue were I wouldn't be here writing this response right now. Luckily, with help, I made it out.\n\nNow you might not believe your brother's issues run this deep and they may not. I will say though that with my social anxiety, I was able to talk normally or be comfortable around a small set of specific people, so if you wonder how he seems fairly normal around family and friends, this could be like my situation. Also, even if your brother isn't an angel, it's apparent that he needs help. It may also be helpful for you to seek therapy if there's a deep resentment eating you up inside. I'm not saying you're wrong for having this resentment if you feel you've been treated differently or some other reason, but it's not something you should bottle up inside. It will hurt you in the long run. \n\nLastly, I don't want to judge here but you should really think about how you feel about your brother. Most of your words come across as resentful, even hateful. If you don't really care about your brother, then you should just live your life and leave his struggles to himself and your parents. If you do care about him, bringing down the rod won't do any good. Like I said before, he may be paralyzed to move towards actions you and everyone else view as easy.  Support him and encourage him to continue with therapy. He may also want to see a behavioral psychologist specifically, as that approach worked best for me in the long run. \n\nGood luck to both of you.", "YTA.

Talk to him. Don't lecture him, don't berate him. Talk to him, talk about what holds him back, see if you can help him work through that and find something that fits his needs.

Maybe some time in the future, ask to have a serious discussion with him and explain that you feel he's not being a contributing household member and and you got angry that you feel he's taking advantage of mother. Then apologize for being an AH and ask why he's living the way he is and LISTEN to his response. Don't interrupt, don't talk over, actually listen. Offer to help if he needs help job-hunting or putting a resume together, maybe he's lost. If he responds with anger or refusal, then just calmly tell him your offer to help still stands if he ever wants to ask you in the future.   \nThen... let it go. Your brother AND your mother are all adults to make all the good or bad decisions with their lives that they want, just as you do with yours. It's my personal conviction to never complain about something unless I can also offer a solution. Even a crazy sounding or far-fetched idea can spark ideas in others. So sorry, OP, you may be NTA most of the time, but in that moment, YTA.", "YTA, sorry. I\u2019m sure you meant well but honestly your brother\u2019s experience sounds similar to my experience with depression. Being a tired insomniac comes with the territory, as does difficulty with keeping at a job or school.\n\nETA: I just saw in the comments that you confirm he struggles with mental health. I gave you the benefit of the doubt that you might not know his condition but goddamn, you *knew* and you still said that!\n\n#YTA\n\nETA2: You said he goes logging a few times a month. Just because it\u2019s not a M-F 9-5 doesn\u2019t mean he lacks a job.", "YTA. If your parents are supporting him financially, he's your parents problem.", "YTA", "YTA- due to my depression i went through 5 jobs in a span of 8 months, I hated myself for not being able to muster up the motivation and strength to go to work. I was at the brink of losing my car my apartment, my water was cut. I was suicidal wanting to run my car off a bridge,parking at the side of the road on my way to work and just breaking down crying and end up being absent for the day.\nHad you been my sister that little comment probably would have been the push over ledge.", "YTA for your comments. None of your business.\nBrother is also TAH if he\u2019s taking advantage of your mom but, again, that\u2019s none of your business and your comments were out of line.", "YTA. you didnt \u2018leave without looking back\u2019 since you\u2019re trying to insert yourself where is none of your business", "YTA for zinging him at the family BBQ needlessly. \n\nAlso, are you sure there aren't any underlying issues? Is he depressed?", "You sound like my asshole friend. A few weeks ago she brought up my work history and talk about about being childish bc we\u2019re all in our early 30s. I haven\u2019t worked in 3 years, the one year bc of Covid and my office closed and the following 2 years bc of a lawsuit I had against my former employer for illegal discrimination. They violated several federal laws when they fired me 2 of them included the Americans with disabilities act and the American pregnancy act. She brought up a job I had in college and all our friends were disgusted with her bc everyday she\u2019s complaining about her job, she\u2019s done this with every job she\u2019s had. \n\nSo yea having being on the receiving end of the same thing you are 100% wrong and need to mind your own damn business and keep your mouth shut!", "Well\u2026 YTA, but I understand how you feel. I too have a younger brother (now 25 years old) still living with my mom, barely contributing financially, and also not exactly a social butterfly. He at least has a consistent job (that my mom helped him get), but he\u2019s just a very difficult person to spend time with. I, like you OP, worked my ass off thru high school to earn scholarships for undergraduate and eventually graduate school. Working jobs constantly throughout the years I spent in college earning my degrees. But for some reason my little brother just doesn\u2019t seem to have that\u2026 drive? And deep down it pisses me off seeing my mom cook his food and do his laundry and have him live almost rent free, it\u2019s like he\u2019s getting a free pass from the hardships of adulthood that me and my other siblings had to endure. It\u2019s also frustrating that most the time you\u2019re around him he just sits there like a lump on a log. But he does struggle with anxiety and depression, and he\u2019s very different from me and I\u2019m learning to accept that. I also worry about him deeply and I think that if he got out there and took on some of life\u2019s challenges he\u2019d realize that he is, in fact, capable of succeeded cause he is brilliant and skilled and worthy. But I too have made some lowball remarks over the years that I\u2019m not proud of, so while YTA I also understand your frustration. \n\nAlso, on a side note, I feel like I\u2019m seeing this trend occur with a lot of young men these days and it\u2019s interesting.", "NTA. Brother should get a job or soon he\u2019ll be your financial problem", "YTA. I'm actually in a very similar situation as you so I understand how you feel. but I would never say something like that to my brother especially at a family event with others around. there are constructive ways to get the message across without crushing the spirit. I know hitting rock bottom is the way a lot of us find the strength to climb back up and thrive but this wasn't the time or place for it. that's more something you should talk with your whole family about since they're involved in his housing and mental health treatment.", "Ehhh he definitely needs a job, you have a point. Your delivery makes YTA. Sounds like you took a personal jab for no apparent reason.", "OP, I'm in a pretty similar situation. I am 21F, and my little brother, 19M, is bumming off my parents, living rent free at home and working for my dad, honestly making dad's days harder than easier.\nAs much as I want him to do what I did - I got a job at 16, moved out at 18, paying for school out of pocket by working full-time since I was 16 -  it's not my place to kick him out of my parents' house, and it's definitely not my place to do it by starting drama at a family event by taking a cheap shot.\nYou're right, and your intentions aren't the problem here, the way you went about it was.\n \nYTA because of your comment and because you started drama at a family event, there was a much better way to handle this situation, frustrated with him as you are. Of course, these things come to a head at the moment, but you didn't come here to be consoled about that, you came here for a judgment.", "Let them handle their own living situation. I can see the logic and empathize being the less coddled kid in my family but YTA for ultimately sticking your nose where it doesn\u2019t belong.", "YTA - you are his sister, not his mother. Also there is such thing as timing, you did in fact ruin the BBQ. Even if it was your place to push him to be more ambitious, you could have chosen a better venue. Lastly not going to sleep on time = lack of discipline, you can in fact have a job and still not manage to get enough sleep. It sounds more like you took the first opportunity you could to take a cheap shot at your brother.", "Holy fuck the meat of these things is always in the comments.\n\nHard YTA", "Wow, what is it with posters lately leaving some critical info out of the post, only to answer in the comments section?\n\nOP was kicking her brother while he's already down.  Hard YTA.", "Piggybacking to ask a legitimate serious question.\n\nAt what point does it become a case of \"get over your mental health issues and work 9-5 Mon-Fri like a normal person\" because that's what it's gotten too between me and my parents and idk what I can do anymore. It's nearly impossible to get out of bed, therapy wasn't helping, and medication is so-so. \n\nDo I just need to suck it up at this point and just go go work and try and be happy?", "YTA. My dad was like this when he wanted me to quit smoking. If I was tired from working a 60+ hour week, it was because I smoked. If I couldn\u2019t do anything he wanted me to do, that\u2019s right, smoking. It never let up, even after I married,  had a child and graduated from law school. It just made me want to light up. Only after he stopped nagging was I able to quit. \n\nOP stop. He\u2019s an adult and so is your mother. I\u2019m not saying that you should enable him, but he knows he isn\u2019t working and I doubt he feels good about this. You are really undermining any confidence he has, which he needs in order to work. You might say that you want him to work, but your actions are saying you want him to fail or at least, to feel so crappy that he will fail. If you can\u2019t actually help him, at least leave him alone. He might have some mental health issues and if he does, you really aren\u2019t helping him.", "She is doing a whole lot of judging for someone in their 5th year of undergrad.", "[deleted]", "Lets be fair we do have evidence the parents are idiots.. They raised OP", "Couldn't agree with you more! They are 23, have a job, and go to college. So do countless other Americans. She is on her high horse and belittled her brother just to be petty.", "???? She should pay their rent???? Make that make sense", "Idk, maybe they are.. They are her parents she would know more than us.. what I'm sensing from the post and her comments is her brother seems to be the golden child and she was the scapegoat kid ( she was expected to work even I high school, went to college get a job etc) and her brother is free to live at home rent free no job. She is definitely an AH but probably because her parents treat her brother like he's  a baby and she's the one that has to be all put together at all times. It's obviously caused deep resentment everyone here needs therapy honestly", "Completely agree, NTA. I also struggle with anxiety and depression but would be so embarrassed to mooch off my parents for years after graduation and then run away and cry when confronted by my sibling. The brother seems to not have any respect for his hard-working parents. The least thing he can do is just get a freakin job and help out a little. Literally any job..", "Not to mention that - mental health issues aside - it was a pretty mild comment. It's incredibly hard for people not suffering from depression to understand how people dealing with it are going to react, so yeah, we can inadvertently say things that will be more of a trigger than we could have guessed. No need to lambast someone for that.\n\nA bit of an annoyed prod at someone to both vent a little and hope to steer them in a better direction isn't the unforgiveable thing that this thread is acting like it is. Running off crying is an _extreme_ response to what was said. I wouldn't have expected this reaction in a million years. This is what I'd have expected if I'd said something along the lines of \"get off your f**king worthless, lazy ass, nobody wants you\".", "I think this is an ESH.\n\nOP could have said nothing at the BBQ. Bad timing.\n\nBut obviously, something needed to be said. Again. As I believe she mentioned she has talked with her brother several times about being an adult, taking on adult responsibility (a regular job), & helping pay expenses where he lives.\n\nOP does have a right to worry about family making piss poor decisions.

He pays for his car insurance but the car is my parents\u2019 and he doesn\u2019t contribute to the household in any other way; he just buys himself fast food and computer games/hardware. He has been coddled and will never fully become a functioning member of society because he has zero coping skills or life skills.

But you also have to realize that at some point, you do need to work a job. Your parents can't take care of you forever; it's honestly not fair to expect them to - the more they spend on on you without you contributing is more they take away from their own retirement. And, they are going to die at some point. When they do, are you going to be able to look after yourself? Or are you going to end up needing to bounce around to another family member who may see you as a burden because they don't really feel you are their responsibility?\n\nAnd truthfully, an actual routine can help. Wallowing in your bed, in your depression just makes it worse.

Maybe they can help you by helping you get up on time, driving you or helping you figure out the bus route, making a lunch, whatever you need to get started.  Doing nothing and wallowing in self pity will never help.  I say this as someone with severe clinical depression and suicide ideation.

She needs to butt out.", "It\u2019s really up to the mom to set rules in her own home with her adult kids.  OP isn\u2019t wrong, but should stay out of it.  But she should also shut the mother down when she starts complaining about the brother to OP.   My mother enabled my brother and was surprised when he had trouble functioning as an adult.\n\nThanks for the additional information about the brother. I was wondering if he was depressed.", "You can have concern for the mom without stepping in and deciding you know what's best and can parent better than your mother, especially when she likely has no parental experience herself. She doesn't even live at the house so she likely doesn't even know the full story. Having concern for your mother and supporting her is one thing, making totally unhelpful, snide ass remarks at your brother during a family cookout doesn't help the situation in anyway. We also know that the mother didn't appreciate the help and told her to leave. Op is just wrong for this.", "Then she should\u2019ve taken it up with her mom.", "She is a selfish self centered sister. Her comments on this post prove that fairly convincingly. She's not doing this out of the good of her heart. She's doing this because she's jealous that she didn't get the same treatment as her brother and because she thinks she can do better. That's why she has made statements like I could solve this problem in a weekend.", "\"running to his room crying\" as opposed to \"he was so upset, he went to his room in tears\" are vastly different phrases in my mind. You are technically right, it could mean mental illness. My reply was more that the phrasing is very familiar to insulting phrases from my own childhood \"don't run off to your room crying\".\n\n If I were to make a 21 year old cry with my words, I would question my empathy before I questioned their mental health. Even if the kid is \"mentally ill\", the crying is probably a result of the OP's lack of empathy (deserved or not) toward this supposed \"mental illness\" rather than just being someone with uncontrolled bouts of crying.", "You have depression? Well, maybe you should try smiling more. /s\n\nNot really helpful is it? That's the kind of advice you gave your brother.", "that\u2019s so effed up. you seem like the kind of person that hopes that something bad happens to your brother. what do you think those sort of cheap shots will lead to? do you know how many men commit suicide? how much young men jill themselves because they feel inadequate. for someone that is diagnosed with mental illness you seem to lack empathy and reach. grow tf up. if your brother ends up ending himself, i hope you remember your own comments and the way you\u2019ve negatively impacted his life to make yourself seem better than him. you just want to help yourself with putting him down and validating yourself up. i hope your worthless prideful crumbles, it\u2019s only built on insecurities and shame. everyone can see it, even internet strangers. you\u2019re a problem, you\u2019re a part of a problem, leave your brother alone if you have nothing kind to say instead of being a nuisance, a hindrance on his health with your pitiful words and \u201csupport.\u201d", "Then speak to your parents and not him!", "girl, berating him in front of your whole family and wishing homelessness on him is NOT the definition of help, just in case you didnt know that already. jesus christ.", "\u201cSpare the rod\u201d lmaooo you realize if you beat a 21 year old you going to jail right?

Older brother quit his steady job over 10 years ago in his early 20s because he felt like it, kept saying he\u2019d start uni, did 1 year, kept deferring, always had an excuse. My parents are so beaten down and tired, they just don\u2019t question him anymore. He\u2019s won, he listens to dude bro podcasts and plays games all day. He had zero intentions in life beyond doing whatever he wants, and is happier than ever now that they don\u2019t question him about his plans anymore. \n\nAll of us in the family have mental health issues, and having someone who does nothing around the house and has zero empathy for my parents creates insane resentment. \n\nI know ppl might see op\u2019s language as an attack on their own mental health struggles and sympathise with the brother (when I was his age I had a year like that too so I get it), but walking on egg shells and doing nothing doesn\u2019t always work, speaking from experience.\n\nSome parents will do anything for their kids, to their own detriment, because rocking the boat and facing reality is more draining than letting someone like that just quietly waste their own life.", "And she can firmly say, I don\u2019t want to discuss this anymore.

If her brother is depressed then I hope he seeks treatment for it, I really do. No one wants to work but 90% of us have to to actually survive.
