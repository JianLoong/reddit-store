I told Hailey that I am sorry and after I deal with this situation we will still go on a cruise, and even suggested to her to start looking for some other options so that we can book the tickets.\n\nHailey was disappointed because she was really looking forward to this trip. She asked if she can go alone, so that our tickets don't go to waste. We had an argument, but I essentially told her that I don't think married women should go on vacation alone, especially on a cruise where she is bound to attract unwanted male attention.

I've been traveling alone since I was in my late teens and if you were my husband, actually you would never become my husband, but if by some cruel twist of fate my actual husband today decided that I've lost my right to travel alone on vacation because of our marriage, our marriage would be over **right now.**\n\nIn fact, I'm actually currently planning a trip to Iceland alone because work has been stressful, tickets are cheap, I have vacation time and my husband doesn't due to a family emergency on his end earlier this year, and I've always wanted to go to Iceland and he does not. I expect to spend a good 2-3 days at the Blue Lagoon in a bikini - male attention? So what? I assume I will get it and will politely bat it off the same way I expect my husband, when he travels alone, will occasionally get female attention and politely decline as well. \n\nI just cannot believe this even a question at this day and age.

Your wife would have a much higher chance of meeting some gal pals than being hit on.\n\nMarried women go on vacation \"alone\" (this is not alone) all the time.  Go on a group tour.

Unfortunately, I had a last minute business emergency that needed to be dealt with right away, so I could not go. Our tickets were prepaid in full and there was no way to get a refund. I told Hailey that I am sorry and after I deal with this situation we will still go on a cruise, and even suggested to her to start looking for some other options so that we can book the tickets.\n\nHailey was disappointed because she was really looking forward to this trip. She asked if she can go alone, so that our tickets don't go to waste. We had an argument, but I essentially told her that I don't think married women should go on vacation alone, especially on a cruise where she is bound to attract unwanted male attention. Hailey got upset and said \"Forget it, we are not going anywhere then\". It's been a week since this happened and I still feel like she is holding a grudge against me.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It\u2019s actually super relaxing.", "Whether or not she would get bored wasn\u2019t his issue.", "Depends on the boat, of course. Most cruise lines have various activities and entertainment venues throughout the ship, running constantly.", "100% the age difference is a factor.", "I didn\u2019t see the 30M part, I\u2019m dumb. My bad!", "Boomer is more of an attitude at this point.", "Don\u2019t be in a relationship with someone you can\u2019t trust. If you\u2019re ever at a point where you feel the need to forbid your partner from doing normal activities on their own, you\u2019re in a very unhealthy spot.", "You can't stop someone from cheating by controlling them.", "If OP believes that's going to happen if Hailey is out of his sight, then the answer is divorce, not controlling her and treating her like a child.", "Ya gotta trust him or her until they give you a reason not to bud.", "Cool. But that\u2019s still a ton of years of crucial brand development that\u2019s spread between them. I am 25 and the idea of dating anyone who isn\u2019t 22+ makes me feel gross. And even then, 22 is seriously pushing it for me\n\nI can\u2019t imagine being thirty and being willing to marry someone that age. \n\nIf you can\u2019t relate to or understand that, either your still very young or creepy. I am going to hope it\u2019s the first one", "The difference between an 18 yo and a 26 year old is literally 7 years of brain development. It's huge.", "I'm 23. Dating an 18 year old would be ick to me. Dating a 30 year old would be ick to me. When I'm 40, dating someone with a 5 year difference might not matter, but in your early 20s, I certainly think it does.", "ew. yes. that's very ick. \n\nAre you a kid or are you a creep? lol. an 18-year-old and a 26-year-old have nothing in common.", "Yup. 100% ick.", "Yeah. It's major ick.", "You will either understand when you're older, or you're a creep", "Do you have to ask your husband for permission to do things?", "Did your husband marry someone 8 years younger than him because he couldn't find someone his age he could control?  I am sure your husband is wonderful :)", "Re-read the post and tell me she is into someone telling her she can't travel alone haha", "No more hole digging tateandrew", "What someone is into while their brain is still not done growing isn't really the point. The point is that HE is beyond the point of still maturing, and seeks out/chooses to be with someone who is still growing. That says a lot about him, as does this scenario.", "Direct this energy at OP, who is telling his wife what he \"allows\" and thinks she shouldn't be places he can't \"protect\" her.", "Nobody said that. \n\nShe's responsible for what she has done wrong (OP lists nothing, by the way).\n\nA controlling guy who intentionally targets younger women because he thinks they're more likely to put up with his bullshit is responsible for his behavior too.", "Exactly! And that doesn\u2019t really bode well for his whole \u201cwe\u2019ll go on another cruise\u201d bs consolation. I would be prepared he would cancel the next trip and not even get excited.", "Can't she take a friend with her?\n\nDo you allow your wife to go out on her own or is she not 'allowed'", "Okay, but you told your wife you'd go on another cruise and she should start looking for tickets. If the situation is still ongoing now, what guarantee did she have you'd honour your word and not just cancel that trip as well? \n\nIf your job takes priority over her and your marriage, just tell her now so she can adjust her expectations.", "So then you deal with that and let your wife enjoy the trip. My husband would have wanted me to go to not waste the tickets, and if I could get a friend to come with on short notice, even better. If you can't trust your wife to know how to deal with unwanted male attention, then you shouldn't even be married.", "Then you do the mature thing and let your wife enjoy a vacation by herself because married woman can do what they want. The right and only option is your wife goes alone.", "OP seems fixated on the fact of her being alone so I just wondered if friends/family was even discussed or he just went ' we are not going and that's the end of it and you're not going on your own because married women mustn't leave their husbands side for any reason '", "Well he's kind of a tool, obviously. I agree with not taking the trip, but I absolutely don't agree with his logic, control, and lack of trust.", "Truly blows my mind how many people don\u2019t get this. Don\u2019t like something your partner is doing? Leave. Like I will truly never understand why someone stays in a relationship where they don\u2019t trust their partner. Like it\u2019s one thing if they did something to betray your trust and now they are actively working on earning it back. But just straight up accepting that your partner can\u2019t be trusted and trying to force them into compliance just doesn\u2019t make any sense to me. You\u2019re pretty much guaranteeing your own unhappiness. Like completely eliminating any chance for you to move on and find someone who gives you what you want without being forced. Make it make sense.", "Depends \n\nCruise isn't exactly a normal activity.\n\nClubbing at it's very core is a meeting ground for let's be classy and say mate selection.\n\nDon't be in a relationship when you can't trust someone.\n\nOtherside of that is if you are in a relationship don't create a scenario where there is a need to not trust you.\n\nExample.\n\nHaving female friends as a husband isn't a big deal.\n\nHaving female friends who express subtle intrest is an issue.\n\nHaving female friends who are your exes is s big deal.", "I was 25 dating a 21 year old and the started dating a 30 year old. Married the 30 year old.", "I\u2019m going with this person is a kid", "That made me laugh", "My reaction to that would be ' sure unless your phone rings again and I'm down on the priority list you AH ' \nI'm at this point super curious what the work emergency even was. Unless OPs is a heart surgeon and one of his patients was dying, I doubt it was something that could not have been sorted over the phone or by others. \nOPs wife is so young, she should be out there living her best life, making memories, instead she's stuck at home with this AH.", "That\u2019s all well and good, but his wife wanted to take the trip. So, I don\u2019t see how you get to ESH. She wanted to do something, and he actively prevented her from doing it only because he didn\u2019t trust her.", "You don\u2019t get to speak for everyone and make hard and fast rules about stuff like that. My husbands ex stood up as the best person at our wedding. Controlling your partner in order to prevent them from cheating reeks of insecurity. And that\u2019s a you problem.", ">Don\u2019t create a scenario where there is a need to not trust you \n\nIf one solo vacation is enough for your partner to cheat, the foundation of that relationship was doomed way before the trip. I never understood this \u201coh, don\u2019t let there be any kind of temptation or else they might cave in\u201d kinda shit. If you\u2019re truly committed to your partner, none of that would be a problem. Being separated and doing your own thing(s) wouldn\u2019t be a problem. Just because you\u2019re in a committed relationship doesn\u2019t mean you have to be connected at the hip 24/7 like some conjoined twins.", "My husband has female friends who are exes and I don't give a fuck.", "I am 25. The idea of dating a 21 year old seems so gross to me. Dating someone who is 30 just makes me feel intimidated by how far ahead in life she would be than me.
