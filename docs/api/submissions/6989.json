They set their date for July of 2023, & our date is in Oct of 2023. My future MIL (67F) is a widow, as my fianc\u00e9 lost his dad a few years ago. She weighed in on our wedding dates being close together, & told us out of town fam members traveling for 2 fam weddings may not go to both. But bc of Covid, not many dates are available & we don't want to wait until 2024- we want to start our fam in the next few years & have some time married beforehand.\n \nMy future MIL has been with her bf for 2 years, since his divorce. They got engaged 2 weeks ago. She called us for a meeting to let us know she, too, wants to have a wedding (she considers it small wedding of 80ish people) & wanted to discuss potential dates. She wanted the month of April. Both my fianc\u00e9, myself, & my future BIL & SIL were concerned about the wedding happening before ours, as we have a few events related to our weddings (& each others) in the spring & summer months. It\u2019s our 1st weddings, so we had bachelor/ bachelorette parties & bridal shower plans already in the works. MIL was frustrated, but said she would look into Dec. While we are all a little frustrated she wants to get married in the same year as us, we said Dec would work based on our timelines.\n \nWe received a text this week that she set a date for 3 weeks after our wedding, in early Nov. This falls during the time my fianc\u00e9 & I were planning to be on our honeymoon. We hadn\u2019t officially booked it but were already researching flights & hotels. We did let her know in the meeting that our off limit dates are the few weeks after our wedding. We are traveling quite a distance away & wanted time in the location. He called to suggest maybe pushing it back by 1 week, to mid Nov. That way, we could go on our honeymoon & be together for the holidays. She was resistant & told us her & her fianc\u00e9 just want to spend their lives together, since they are older & do not want to wait for 2024. She felt it was a bit of a gift to accommodate having her wedding after ours. She wants to avoid Dec since the holidays make it tougher on those traveling/ spending time their fams. She said one of her friends is sick & has scheduled treatments, so she wanted to consider her schedule. We are likely going to have to honeymoon over Thanksgiving, as other months are difficult for my work.\n \nI am concerned ppl will have a hard time traveling to both our wedding & theirs being 3 weeks apart & will be forced to choose. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 didn\u2019t understand why I was upset & thinks I need to let this go & we can work around it, but I\u2019m angry at her lack of consideration of her sons.

You don\u2019t get to block off the whole year for your weddings.", "YTA- I'd (kind of) understand if it was the only date you don't like, but jeeez... you basically wiped half a year off her potential wedding dates. Your wedding is NOT more important than hers to anyone but you and your partner.", "YTA, are there any times of day you'd like to veto? She can't do April because you don't want it interfering with your wedding \"events.\" She can't do the entire first half of the year because you don't want her wedding happening before yours.  This is a nonsense objection.", "YTA. Your MIL just wants to get married after finding happiness again following the loss of her spouse, and her kids and their SOs are preventing it at every turn.

Was a bridal shower in March, a wedding in April, a second bridal shower in May, a bachelorette party in June and the second one in September not an option?), July and October were obviously off-limits, the two months in between would only make the situation more complicated for everyone who had to travel and frankly, December just seems like a stupid month for a wedding and I think you're well aware of that.\n\nSo she picked the one time window that was still roughly workable after you refused the first half of the year, and now you're pissed off because it's too close to your wedding.\n\nTo me this falls under the heading of \"play stupid games, win stupid prizes\".\n\nAnd yes, YTA for passive-agressively trying to force her to move her wedding to 2024.

No one cares about you getting married other than you, the groom, and maybe like 6 other people at the wedding. Most people attend weddings just to party, have something to do, or feel obligated to come because they have to. Don\u2019t feel like the quality of your wedding is determined by how many people can attend. \n\nI don\u2019t see what your MIL is doing as anything you\u2019re saying when her own kids seem to be ok with it. Her reasons for getting married sooner than later are pretty reasonable and just because it\u2019s her 2nd marriage doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s any less important than yours.\n\nAlso I don\u2019t see the big deal of why she can\u2019t get married in April.

The best option would have been for her to have the wedding in the spring, but for some reason you think a bachelorette party is going to be a major conflict (How much overlap in guests would those have anyway? How is it even an issue unless they are the same day) so that didn\u2019t happen, and now you\u2019re mad. Your MIL tried to accommodate you, you were difficult, and now she\u2019s just doing it her way.

I wanted an October wedding for up north leaves changing, my cousin set his date a week before I did.  Yet no one was a baby about it.

It may be a life-changing event for you and your husband, but for everyone else it\u2019s just a party.", "YTA\n\nYou need a whole wedding YEAR to be about you? Seriously? \n\nMIL has been engaged longer than you and has been impacted by Covid as well. \n\nShe wanted to marry in April and you had an issue with that. She picked another date that doesn\u2019t have a conflict and now you\u2019re not okay with that either\u2014not because there\u2019s an actual problem but because you *might* want to travel at that time or people *might* not attend all of the weddings.\n\nYou are way too wrapped up in the wedding and not thinking about the marriage. The only people who need to show up are you, the groom, the officiant, and a witness. Anything beyond that is icing on the cake. \n\nYou\u2019re coming off as very selfish and bridezilla like and I sincerely doubt that is your intention. But you really need to get over yourself.

Focus on your wedding, and allow others to have weddings when they want them. I think your MIL is right with her statement that they are getting old and want to get married and live their lives.

As far as I am concerned, as long as it isn't the week of, she should be able to get married at any time during the year she damn well wants to. She was being considerate in asking you. She was even willing to compromise. You, however, don't seem to know the definition of the word.\n\nGet over yourself.

How much time are people supposed to dedicate to you and your wedding? Your wedding is a day. She\u2019s already compromised on the spring and summer because of events surrounding your wedding.

She said the two wedding dates being so close together would make  people not attend as they wouldn't want to travel so far and so back to back.\n\nRealistically I think you're both being selfish. She initially said the two wedding dates were too close - to go against her own words to create the same problem is bizarre to me.\n\nThat being said it's your wedding and it's her wedding.

It sounds like you didn't have locked in dates for all of those pre-wedding events and she easily could have locked in a time in April to be planned around.\n\nStop forcing her to move things around so much.\n\nYou're not as compromising as you think you are, but I think it's shitty of her to be a hypocrite to her own reasoning of not wanting weddings so close together.", "Don\u2019t even have to read passed the title. Another bridezilla who thinks the world revolves around her and has to stop for months because she\u2019s getting married. Get over yourself.", "ESH.

You don't own the entire year, and you don't co-own the year with your future BIL/SIL.\n\nThere are 52 weekends in the year, let's take out 5 each for various wedding events, 1 for the wedding, that's 12 weeks for you/fiance + BIL/SIL combined, leaving 40 other weekends for your MIL to use. It is not fair to ban her from getting married before you. From your language I'm guessing you're in the US, which means you know that mid-Nov and later is basically the holiday deadzone. She wanted to get married in 2022, and you relegated her to the worst two months of the year to get married, and made her wait as long as possible. Let her pick her date. And by the way, if she does get married in November, and her events interfere with yours, remember that you're the one who stipulated that she get married after you, and effectively forced her to do it no more than a maximum of 8 or so weeks after you. She wanted to get married in April, 3 months before BIL/SIL and 6 months before yours. By the time you got married, MIL would have been settled and done and all the attention would be on you. Now your wedding is just Act Two of a 3-Act Show instead of the big finale. And now instead of a quick wedding planned on just a few months, she has 9 months to put together a bigger event. Nice work.\n\nAll of that being said, MIL should have pushed for an early date if she was really that eager, or just held off since it's not a great way to start out with either of her DILs. It also puts more pressure on any shared guests to travel 3x in a single year, and might mean that certain relatives will have to pick and choose. While I stand by the fact that you don't own the dates, it does strike me as a bit unusual that someone who has two major family weddings would want to host their own as well.", "NTA who plans a wedding for 3 weeks after their sons wedding.

Way to much drama", "NTA\n\nMIL is being selfish, good for her for finding someone, but it's her 2nd marriage, not her first.

Regardless, it sounds like a mess, so I wish you luck.", "The only people esential to a wedding are the groom and the bride, your future husband is right let this go, you don't own the whole year 2023, in fact you don't own a single day, get over your self a wedding is just a party to celebrate a marriage, is not this earth shattering event that is relevant for everyone you know. YTA.", "But she is the bride and wants the whole of 2023 to her wedding only since it\u2019s her FIRST. Lol.", "There was a post earlier today about a wedding taking place a day before the OP\u2019s birthday and another function a few days after and that was voted NTA. If anything I feel like that OP is more TA than this OP", "Yup. You get a day. A week is gracious. More than that is bridezilla territory.", "Yeah OP doesn't own the dates so to me they're still TA but honestly unless there's some hidden reason like health issues, it does seem a little passive-aggressive, she knows her two DILs have put a lot of work into dividing up dates, she knows that it might impact guest attendance to have even two weddings, and she's like actually \"I'm going to get married too.\" And then when OP pushes back she decides that instead of 3 weddings in 7 months, it's 3 weddings in 5 months, with her wedding just weeks after OP's. I would guess that she's feel kind of lonely at the idea of both her sons leaving her so close together and maybe wants a partner at her side to experience that, but cutting it that close feels a little intentional. A lot of people in MIL's position wouldn't even consider getting married that close to two of their kids' weddings, simply because weddings are so much time and work and money that the mere idea of squeezing a third would send their stress levels over the edge. It makes me wonder how involved MIL is and how involved she wants to be in both weddings.", "I think the whole damn family should get married the same day. It\u2019ll save everyone a lot of trouble.", "why ?  why not leave directly after the wedding ?  curious is all\u2026", "Yeah but April still would have still meant 3 weddings in 7 months (April-October). Now it's 3 weddings in 5 months (July-November).\n\nI think they should have just let her get married in April but still.", "WTF is up with people wanting the whole YEAR to be about their wedding??!!?  Why can't FMIL get married in April? What could you possibly be forcing your friends and family to do that far in advance of July and October weddings?? Or is she just not allowed to be a bride before you are?  I just don't get it!  The idea that 15 minutes or so (unless it's a religious service) in my life should occupy everyone I know for months is ridiculous.  More brides need to remember that many guests are only attending to be polite.", "Sure! There is a ton of stuff to do directly before and after the wedding, and the event itself is pretty intense/tiring. Having to prep for a big trip AND a wedding at the same time is too much. Same thing with all the post-wedding tasks and post-trip tasks. And you want to rest and relax in the day or so after your wedding, not run around an airport or deal with jet lag!\n\nWe had a small wedding with pretty minimal decorations and no boxed gifts, and we still had a bunch of stuff to pack up and take home, organize and so on. We had a pretty beefy to-do list, and most people will have even more to do than we did. We were able to relax, get all the post-wedding stuff done, and then shift gears to the trip preparations without feeling rushed. We actually JUST got home from our honeymoon last night and I am SO grateful that all we have to do is unpack and do laundry! \n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that a lot of people give checks as gifts. Cashing them before you go means more money to enjoy your trip!", "Her children are getting married this year because they are eager to start the next chapter of their lives.\n\nMIL is *also* eager to start the next chapter of hers - so eager, in fact, she wanted to have her wedding in April. A whole 6 months from OP\u2019s wedding, meaning OP wouldn\u2019t have had to worry about dates overlapping with honeymoons or being \u201ctoo close\u201d to her wedding date. \n\nBut OP specifically requested MIL change her date to avoid getting married *before* her, so the November date being selected is **already** a compromise on MIL\u2019s behalf.", "Who is going to the bachelor/bachelorette parties? Are you telling us that every weekend from April to July is filled with premarital activities for these self absorbed couples?", "I think so too. I'm just speaking to her deciding to hold off until November. That is worse than just doing it in April. If she is going to push it off until November, she may as well wait until after the holidays and do it in 2024 since many people probably won't be able to attend.", "gotcha.  i just figured that you planned it along with the wedding and were good to go.  didn\u2019t think of after wedding tasks.", "67 is not that old, plenty of people aren't even retired yet at that age. Unless she and her SO have a health issue they for some reason didn't include in their reasoning to OP, they're not exactly living on borrowed time.\n\nI do not think OP has the right to block MIL or stop MIL, she should have let her get married in April instead of forcing her to negotiate and in the end making things work. That being said, I highly highly doubt MIL's choice to get married was a choice made in a vacuum/coincidental and a lot of people in MIL's position would consider it a no-brainer to not have a wedding within a year of not one but two of their children. From a purely practical standpoint, it makes scheduling more complicated for her two future DILs, adds additional expenses in a year where she's already spending money on gifts/travel/wedding expenses, and puts more pressure on their extended family who now have 3 weddings to attend. And while her new date is worse for OP, it's also worse for MIL herself, she now has to plan her own wedding in between all of these other wedding obligations.", ">MIL is older and doesn\u2019t want to wait.\n\nAnd who know if one or the other of them has a health condition and they want to be legally married soonest for control and benefit reasons.", "We did, more or less. Hotels and air were booked well in advance. But we didn\u2019t really plan the day-to-day stuff until after the wedding. Before the trip we also had to give the house an extra clean, buy extra supplies for the pets and house sitter, get packed up and so on \u2014 I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to do all that while also prepping for the wedding!", "I'm sorry...l must have missed this in the rulebook of life...  Can someone tell me where it says her happiness is more important than that of her future MIL's??", "YTA", "YTA - and for your family's sake why not have one big wedding for all of you??????", "YTA for talking her out of April. That is months before your weddings and you shouldn't be having anything to do with your weddings that early. And even if you are it would only be with friends since no one wants to go to 10 different things for someone's wedding especially months before. Talk to them again and see if they can still do April and be a good future daughter-in-law. This marriage is just as important to her as yours is to you. And in some ways, more since they have less time left than you do - assuming normal lifespans.", "YTA.\n\nSorry, but get over yourself.", "YTA.", "Jeez Louise, OP! \n\nEntitled much?

You and future SIL don't get to monopolize the whole spring when you are getting married in July and October, or the whole fall for your honeymoon, and you don't get to have the whole year as the only brides either.\n\nThe second wedding comment is a bit interesting too, considering her first husband DIED.  It's not like she's out there getting married every couple of years.  \n\n  \nWhy can't you all just be happy for her, and make it work?  She's asking for one day.", "Hahahaha, you were all anoyed she wants to marry in the SAME YEAR AS YOU!?!? ARE YOU INSANE???", "YTA. If you're on honeymoon then just don't go.

It became super common due to COVID and seems like it would resolve all the issues.", "It\u2019S mY wEdDiNg YeAr!", "That one bugged me too, I feel like some grown adults are just too much about their birthdays - no other events can happen near it, it must be celebrated on THE day, no one else is allowed to have a life or other plans, etc.  I'm all for celebrating, but yikes.", "Right? I don\u2019t see how it\u2019s rude for the MIL to get married first, MONTHS before their scheduled date. And 3 weeks after is no big deal. Either shorten the honeymoon or go later, the world won\u2019t end either way.", "So the entire year is reserved for you?", "YTA, you were frustrated she wants to get married the same year? Get over yourself! You don\u2019t get a whole year to celebrate or get attention or whatever it is you think you deserve for just getting married. She\u2019s 67 and doesn\u2019t want to wait.

Stop being an entitled, selfish asshole.", "ESH\n\nHonestly the OP is being a bit of a bridezilla but 3 wedding from the same family in a year is a lot never mind 5 months.  There are likely to be multiple guest overlaps due to it being one family.  People are going to be expected to fork out for 3 different weddings (expenses to attend and gifts, not including pre wedding events), 2 of which are not really that long before Christmas.  And there were be people who feel obligated to attend even if they cannot afford it.\n\nI also feel MIL is setting herself up for a lot of declined RSVP's with it being so soon after the sons.\n\nI come from a massive family on my dad's side (high double digits just with first cousins and aunts and uncles, triple digits when you add in first cousins kids and grandkids).  Still managed to avoid 3 weddings in one year.", "YTA: So, no other family member dares to get married the same year you do?", "Another one with \"the whole world should stop revolving, because I'm getting married, and no one has ever weddinged the way I'm going to.\" Get over yourself.

They gave her December when her close friend could not make it, she's considerate that she asked her future DIL's. People can come or not come to the wedding no one's forcing anyone, they are also not forced to give expensive gifts. She's more considerate than OP. Fiance is also a son and what wierd competition is this that he'd rather his mom be happy than his wife, he's choosing the right thing to do if it upsets any party then that party needs to work in it, a wife's or husband's unreasonable demands to keep them happy should not be entertained.", "3 weeks is an absurdly long vacation for most people in the US. \n\nNot many people get that much vacation time from work, and even employers with generous amounts of vacation time might not allow you to take it all at once.", "What?!

Then when it was her wedding she decided that the spacing the weddings out doesn\u2019t actually matter anymore and everyone can make due.
