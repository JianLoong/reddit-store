I am also a girl (25) but that\u2019s besides the point.\n\nJenny didn\u2019t have a good childhood. Her parents were shitty people and she left the second she could. She did have to leave behind her little brother(18) and sister (14). She has said that she doesn\u2019t regret anything and had to put herself first. \n\nWell, stuff happened and turns out her siblings have been living with their aunt for two years now. Jenny did not know this and only found out after she ran into one of her cousins at the mall. The cousin was being a little shady which really embarrassed Jenny so she made an attempt to reach out by calling her aunt. Her aunt was hesitant but ultimately decided to let her speak to her brother who told her to fuck off before hanging up.\n\nJenny\u2019s been really upset by this. She keeps getting mad at me for talking to my brother or hanging out with my brother saying that I\u2019m shoving our good relationship in her face. To avoid getting her upset, I no longer hang out with my brother at our house and every time she\u2019s around, I hang up. \n\nI have tried so hard to be understanding. \n\nMy final straw was when we were driving to the grocery store and I got a call from my brother who was sobbing and crying. I was so concerned and he asked if I could pick him up from school so I immediately went to pick him up. I could tell Jenny was put off by this but he was crying so much. I drove him home and comforted him for a bit but the second Jenny and I got back into the car she blew up on me.\n\nShe accused me of trying to make her uncomfortable on purpose and she was especially upset because I didn\u2019t ask her if she was okay with picking my brother up and ditching grocery shopping. \n\nI said sorry but I was already stressed out from my brother\u2019s situation so when she started yelling at me even more for being inconsiderate of her feelings and boundaries I yelled back and told her that I\u2019m not going to treat my brother like crap just so she can feel better about herself. What\u2019s done is done and instead of taking her anger and jealousy out on me, she could try harder to be there for her own siblings. She went super quiet and demanded I drop her off at her friend\u2019s house. She then told me that she can\u2019t believe I\u2019d stoop that low and hasn\u2019t spoken to me since. She won\u2019t even read my texts. I know I was harsh and it probably wasn\u2019t my place, but she really expected me to ignore my 15year old brother\u2019s distress???

I don't even think what you said was that bad. Your girlfriend needs therapy, and to learn the difference between \"boundaries\" and being a controlling AH. She's being a controlling AH.", "Wow. NTA. I was expecting something a little worse than that, but it sounds like you just said the quiet part out loud. Sure, you did it out of anger and probably said it aggressively, but you were just letting out what you\u2019ve been thinking (and what I was thinking the whole time reading this). Yes, you never should have let her think it was okay to make you see and talk to your brother less because it made her uncomfortable. You shouldn\u2019t have bent in that way to acquiesce to her. She was being beyond unreasonable. But her yelling at you for helping your brother when he was crying? That\u2019s absurd. It sounds like she has a lot of trauma that she needs to work through, and maybe you can work through it together, but don\u2019t let her make you into less of yourself so that she can feel better.", "NTA.\n\nShe has no right to try and deprive you of your relationship with your family just because hers is horrible. She either needs to go to therapy or consider y'all's relationship and future relationships for her done because she isn't stable enough for a relationship.", "NTA, DO NOT damage your healthy relationship because she doesn't have that with her family. Everyone is dealt different cards, you guys have fostered love and respect. She needs to put in the time to get that with her siblings if she really wants that, her making you have less than what you have earned is disrespectful. If you have to lose her over this it's more of a bullet-dodge situation. Until she gets help she wwon'tbe ready for anything worthwhile.", "NTA. Something is seriously effed up though. Do not let your GF isolate you from other people you are close to", "NTA you were right and she needs to realize the world doesn\u2019t stop or revolve around her", "NTA\n\nShe's being pretty horrible to you, actually. She's trying to destroy your relationship with your brother out of jealousy.\n\nShe needs to sort her own shit out, not put it on you.", "NTA - you're in clearly what is an abusive relationship. It's baffling you're worried about \"stooping low\" when what you should be working on is getting out of that relationship asap. It doesn't matter if Jenny had a bad childhood. She has to fix her own issues and not take them out on you. Apologize to your brother for your actions and go visit him whenever you want.", "NTA. You Definitely didn't stoop low at all. You were honest and set a boundary. It would be a complete waste to tank your relationship with your brother for a partner. I think it's great you are close to your brother. That relationship belongs to you and you can nurture that how you would like to.\n\nYour gf's relationship with her brother is hers and separate from what you have and I suggest you intentionally reverse whatever past expectations to tip toe around her unresolved feelings about leaving her siblings (who obviously didn't react well to it).\n\nI think sometimes when we set boundaries we can feel like the bad guy. But you are not. You weren't vicious, you weren't trying to hurt anyone, you were just making space for what's important to you. She has her own work to do. It is hers. It's not yours.\n\n(edited for a typo)", "NTA. I'm sorry but your girlfriend is extremely toxic, this probably isn't going to be the relationship for you until she gets the mental health help that she so desperately needs. She can't expect you to stop at your life in your relationships with your loved ones to appease her issues. People throwing out this boundary word is basically a joke these days, she doesn't have a right to set a boundary on you and your family", "NTA.  Her current expectations of how you will interact with your own family are wildly unrealistic and toxic.   She needs to get into therapy and work her stuff out.", "NTA. She sounds like she needs some SERIOUS therapy. You're right - just because she has a lot of feelings about sibling relationships, doesn't mean that you don't deserve to have a good relationship with your brother.", "Absolutely NTA, but is your brother okay now?", "NTA. jenny has to figure her own shit out. if i were you, i'd leave. jenny is toxic as fuck and doesnt want to hold herself accountable", "NTA. You didn\u2019t stoop low at all she was projecting her issues and insecurities regarding her choices onto you. Why should you have a crappy relationship with your siblings because she doesn\u2019t have one?

Either have an argument every time you talk to your sib or break up. It is simple as that.

She has said that she doesn\u2019t regret anything and had to put herself first.\n\nI grew up in a toxic home.  I left at 18 for college, moved across the country because I needed the distance and had to put myself first.  I left my 16 year old brother behind (though I still called him frequently).  My brother is 37, happily married, successful in his career and basically thriving in life.  And yet, I still feel some guilt for abandoning him back then.\n\nThe fact that she has no regrets and her siblings want nothing to do with her, leads me to think the other commenters may have it correct: your girlfriend may be a narcissist.

I think she\u2019s mostly upset because his reason wasn\u2019t sad enough to her and she feels like it was a waste of time and he could\u2019ve toughened up instead of calling me crying. But my thing is that I don\u2019t give a shit if he was crying over a breakup, a bully, a bad grade, whatever\u2014if something is making him cry that much I\u2019ll literally leave work.

But she definitely crossed the line in this instance. She can\u2019t make you not to be there for your brother. She can ask for space, but you don\u2019t always need to respect that request. And her accusation that you are doing all this to rub her face in your good relationship is absolutely untenable and is clearly the result of someone not thinking clearly", "Don't take breaks in relationships. Either you're all in or all out. \n\nI highly doubt she has never acted this way before, but that you don't recognize abusive behavior. But it sounds like you are adamant about staying with her, so try this:\n\nWhile you shouldn't have yelled at her, you need to be firm. \"I am sorry I yelled at you. I understand you have difficult feelings with your family, and I want to be there for you. However, you can not control how much I can see my family or make inappropriate comments about it. Do you think you can do that?\"\n\nYou also need to tell her that stonewalling and silent treatments is not acceptable in a healthy relationship.\n\n You need to hold her more accountable and stop making excuses for her. We all have our issues and stressors. It doesn't mean we get to treat our partners like shit. That's not what a life partner is supposed to be, so I hope you can recognize that.", "The whole point of relationships is to find someone that you can be with FOREVER.\n\n\nIf you \"need a break\" already, then you haven't found the right person.", ">she\u2019s not a bad person and has NEVER acted like this before\n\nAre you sure she hasn't acted like this before?
