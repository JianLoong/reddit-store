It is quite expensive but my mum was more than happy to bring me there as i had seriously loved it when my dad brought me. At the dinner my mum looked over the menu and pulled a face, i immediately knew what what going to happen.\n\nmy mum had asked for a kids menu for my 8 year old little sister and after my sister chose something off of that she looked over it. when the waitress came over we all ordered and my 37 year old mother ordered off of the kids menu. i kind of sank into my chair and had a red face all night as everyone at the table ate adult food my mum was eating kids food.\n\nWhen we got home i lost it at my mum and i might have been a complete asshole here but this is how its been my entire life, i just wanted one night were my mum would eat like a normal person and not embarrass me at a dinner that was meant to be about my success. while in the mists of me asking her why she has to be like this my mum started crying and apologising and kept repeating \"you know how hard it is for me\" and \"do you not think I'm also embarrassed\"  which is her go to whenever anyone tried to pull her up about her eating habits.\n\nMy dad later said i was an asshole for shouting at my mum when she had done so much and spent so much just so i could have a nice dinner with the whole family but i dont think i am because she could had just not eaten or ordered some bread instead of eating off the kids menu. so AITA?  \n\n\nEDIT: Okay so i am certainly, 100%, without a doubt, an absolutely raging asshole. just tried to type a whole explanation out but i exceeded the character limit so please read my comments. thank you for making me see how much of an ungrateful brat i was being ", "created_utc": 1697382280, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178hb7h/aita_for_shouting_at_my_mum_for_embarrassing_me/", "score": 1211, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She has a medical condition that is recognized and protected by law in most cases. You are self absorbed af for even getting upset or caring what your mom orders or eats. \n\nImagine your mom loving you and struggling with this her whole life, only for her child to make her feel like a failure and embarrassment. \n\nI am heartbroken for your mom, you should be ashamed of yourself.", "YTA. Your mom\u2019s food choice has literally nothing to do with you, and no impact on you. \n\nYou took her to a place where you knew she wouldn\u2019t have many options.  She didn\u2019t make a scene - she found something she could eat, and she ate it.\n\n\nThis is tantamount to her yelling at you for eating things she\u2019s not able to - which would also be ridiculous.", "YTA. Grow up and get the fuck over yourself. My mum orders off the kids menu all the time because  she wants a smaller meal.", "The only person who should be embarrassed here is you. You got angry at your mother for a ridiculous reason (a kid's menu is literally just an arbitrary title, the food on it doesn't actually have an age restriction) and then made her feel bad because you view her having autism at her as if she's less than. YTA", "YTA. You are the only person in the restaurant who cared what your mom ate. The other patrons didn\u2019t care, the staff didn\u2019t care, the chef didn\u2019t care, because it doesn\u2019t matter. If you really wanted your mom to order something specific you should have picked a different restaurant with foods on the regular menu she would eat \u2014 you\u2019ve lived with her your whole life, surely you know what her safe foods are and you can tell from an online restaurant menu what she\u2019s going to be able to eat. \n\nAlso, PS: you definitely got hired because of nepotism. Even if your dad works in a different department, he\u2019s still a longtime employee and him putting in a good word for you counts for a lot.", "YTA. You just wanted one night where your mom didn\u2019t have an eating disorder. Nobody at that restaurant cared that sh ordered off the kids menu. Except for you. She did nothing wrong.", "YTA you spoiled pretentious brat. I hope for your mother's sake this fake. How dare you? She has a DIAGNOSED EATING DISORDER. \n\nTo think all that she has done for you, and you want her to GO HUNGRY WHILE PAYING FOR YOUR FOOD. All so you can put up a front to complete strangers.\n\nAbsolutely disgusting behavior. \n\nPeople like you are why I don't want kids.", "YTA\n\nWhat the hell? They're proud of you. She was \"more than happy\" because you \"seriously loved it\". You knew of her condition. You also knew she can't just turn it off.\n\nSo after doing something nice for you and thinking she'd made her son happy, her son explodes at her for not being able to magically make her eating disorder vanish? The eating disorder he knew she has and cannot turn off?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>kept repeating \"you know how hard it is for me\" and \"do you not think I'm also embarrassed\" which is her go to whenever anyone tried to pull her up about her eating habits.\n\nGo-to?

Who cares? How was this even embarrassing? Because of how it *looked*? Are you *that* obsessed with appearances that something as harmless as an adult eating mac 'n' cheese is somehow a sin? Really think about it and ask yourself how this negatively impacted your life in any real way. You're showing your age here, man. There are only two kinds of people who actually care about this:\n\n1. High schoolers who so desperately want to be an adult but have no idea what that actually means so they compensate by rejecting anything and everything that could even vaguely insinuate being childish\n2. Snobby adults who are so obsessed with appearances that they can only hang out with each other because literally no one else can tolerate them\n\nDo you really want to be either of those people? Save that energy for things that are actually relevant in life.", "Man YTA. Go apologize.", "YTA - how is your mom eating her chicken tendies or whatever in anyway embarrassing for you? There was no need to yell at her, you definitely need to apologize.", "Jesus man. She let you choose the place and didn\u2019t make any issues about it except she wanted to order something off the kids\u2019 menu.

YTA 100times, you should sincerely apologize to her asap,  because if she could i'm sure she would act differently in those situations, you're blaming her for being on the spectrum and having arfid, she has no power over that. Grow up bro, seriously, and read some books.", "YTA\n\n\"Eating habits\"? \" i just wanted one night were my mum would eat like a normal person\"?\n\nDo you think she's doing this because she chooses to? And she can stop if she wants?\n\nYou're embarrassing.", "YTA. Your lack of compassion for your mom in this situation is alarming. Even in your words, she sounds like a wonderful and caring woman, who would have certainly enjoyed the menu of the expensive place she allowed YOU to pick if she could. This outburst of yours may have been due to some repressed resentment over the years, but be an adult and use your big girl voice to communicate that. You ruined your own night.\n\nEdit: I just read that you would have rather she\u2019d not eaten at all?? What an awful and entitled human you are. Your poor parents.", "YTA - you sound weirdly controlling about your mom's eating. Since you've landed a grown-up job, maybe it's time for you to act like a grown-up, too, and learn how to accept your mother's place on the spectrum?", "YTA. How did what your mother eat embarrass you? It may have been strange for an adult order from the kids menu but how does that affect you?", "When I saw the thread title I was expecting something much worse, like she got drunk and made a scene or something. But all she did was order off the kids menu?? YTA. A big one. Go apologize to your mum. Next paycheck take her out to eat and let her order whatever she wants.", "YTA.", "YTA.\n\nI wouldnt give a flying fuck if anyone I know ordered from the \"kids menu\".", "YTA it sounds like your mum wanted to do something nice to celebrate you and got yelled at in return. Try being a bit more grateful. It also sounds like the dinner was family only, so they should already know that your mom only eats certain foods. \n\nThat being said, if she knows she has this disorder, she could have checked the menu beforehand to see if there was something she could eat. This would have allowed you and her to choose a place that would be suitable for both of you. I\u2019m surprised she doesn\u2019t always look at the menu in advance, and you didn\u2019t think to do this either. \n\nAlso INFO: what does your mom do when she needs to go to a place/event where there isn\u2019t any \u201ckid\u201d food served? Does she just not eat anything?", "Yta big time! Go say sorry to your mum!", "YTA!  Big time!! You don't deserve your mother or what she does for you.", "All this\u2026.over her food choice?\n\nYou\u2019re insufferable \n\nYTA", "wow.. YTA. just wow.", "YTA.  Tell me, in detail, how her order impacted you in the slightest.  Adults order off of the kid's menu for a million different reasons to include health issues, allergies, not being that hungry, etc.  Her order had nothing to do with you and didn't embarrass you in the slightest.", "Your poor mom... I'm embarassed for her for having such an asshole for a son. If you ever, in the future, treat anyone else in your life like this... respectfully... fuck you.\n\nYou met a good and loving intention (taking you out) with insults - end of story. Get some wisdom and stop judging people negatively for literally harmless actions.", "Oh, kid, YTA.  Such an AH.\n\nYour mom arranged a dinner for you at a place you wanted to go that was expensive.  It was to celebrate your job.\n\nYour mom has an eating disorder.  As she said, do you not think she knows this and is embarrassed eating off the kids menu?\n\nShe will never \"eat normally just once\" for you or anyone else unless she overcomes this disorder.\n\nApologize to her.  Grovel.  Cook her a meal of the only foods she eats.\n\nThis post absolutely broke my heart for your mother.", "YTA I have ARFID and I'd give anything to eat normally. I suppose if she gagged and reached and maybe vomited and cried you'd prefer that as it's less embarrassing? \n\nShe has an eating disorder! You absolute git! You shamed her for her eating disorder in public! If anyone deserves embarrassment it's you.", "YTA, why are you trying to force your mom to pretend to be neurotypical? Do think we choose to be neurodivergent? Do you think it can just be turned off? Do you prefer to watch her repeatedly gag or even throw up in public? Grow up. Educate yourself and apologize to your poor mom.", "Yta. Everything you have is thanks to your parents sacrifices and you storm off because you're mom is eating a kid plate instead of an \"adult\" one. You may have a good job, but this doesn't make you an adult. Apologize to your mother and grow up", "Wow, YTA. You're 19, time to grow up.", "YTA- in spades, you\u2019re TA.  I  do sincerely and deeply hope that your father is so disgusted by your behaviour that he invites you to go live elsewhere. If anyone EVER spoke to me like that in front of my husband , there would be serious consequences.", "YTA. What an awful, spoiled, entitled, childish little brat you are! You should have been forced to order off the kids menu and been given crayons and an activity book to keep you occupied. Your behaviour at the restaurant, sulking, all red and embarrassed is the stand out behaviour that everyone would have noticed. You don't deserve such a wonderful mother who went out of her own comfort zone to please you. She certainly doesn't deserve such a horrible, ungrateful child! Shame on you!", "YTA. That\u2019s really ungrateful. Even without having ARFID, people on the spectrum struggle with food textures anyway. There was *no need* for your behaviour.", "YTA and a huge one. You\u2019re so caught up by what your mom eats and guarantee you, you\u2019re the only person that noticed. Also, your thought that her eating breadsticks would have been better is laughable. \n\nGet over yourself and be happy you have a mom that loves and wanted to celebrate you. You should really apologize to your mom for being a major AH and should reflect on yourself. You have some major growing up and maturing to do. You might have gotten an \u201cadult\u201d job, but you\u2019re definitely still acting like a little kid. \n\nYou should feel embarrassed for how you treated your mother.", "You're the AH. I thought your mother did something really embarrassing like making a scene, yelling at the server for not having a special menu just for her. Your server doesn't give a flying fuck if an adult orders from the child's menu. They only give a fuck if said adult is going to leave a reasonable tip.\n\nYou hurt your mother and you better damn well apologize and make it up to her.\n\nVery much the ASSHOLE!", "YTA.\n\nReplace your mom's disability with any other physical difference. Would you yell at a person in a wheelchair for not taking the stairs? A deaf person for not hearing you call their name?\n\nYou are the only family embarrassment that I see.", "As a sufferer of arfid myself. You are an ass. Your mother probably feels bad enough as it is.", "INFO\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you?", "Seriously YTA\n\nIf your mom wanted something from the kids menu, LER HER ENJOY IT\n\nYou seem overly immature and concerned about what people will think, and were abusive towards her", "YTA\n\nAnd moreso an embarrassment honestly. Your 19, you *know* what your mothers situation is. There really isn't any kind of excuse for this,, I'm honestly confused why your here,, what did you think you did even remotely right here?", "You even stated its an eating disorder... YTA, its not like anorexia where you can get help, it can make folks violently ill.", "YTA Your mother took you where you wanted to eat, didn\u2019t complain and simply ordered a meal she could eat. It didn\u2019t affect you at all. Yet you had to embarrass and belittle your mom. She deserves better.", "YTA. You knew your mom was like this. Why would you think she'd be any different on your special night? Did you pull her aside and ask if she would order \"adult food\"? It doesn't sound like you did. In any case, it sounds like her issue is quite intractable, 37 years' worth of intractable. You yelled at her for doing what she always does.", "YTA and a poor excuse for a son, shaming his mum for eating food.. who gives a hell what menu it came from, it is still food.\n\nMy mum doesn\u2019t eat big portions, so when we go out to restaurants. She sometimes chooses meals from the kids menu, for example. If she fancies a steak, she will order a kids style and not a massive steak from the main menu\u2026 \n\nApologise to your mother and never ever shame her or anyone else on how they order their food that makes them comfortable.\n\nTime to grow up little boy, you are an adult now.. stop being so immature and disrespectful.", "YTA", "YTA even if she didn\u2019t have an eating disorder WHO CARES if she eats off the kids menu, so she didn\u2019t like anything on the adult menu but liked something on the kids menu and this shouldn\u2019t matter at all but you decide to yell at her for no fucking reason Jesus OP you\u2019re awful", "YTA.

There are just meals  - and being able to accept that everyone can eat whatever they like without finding it embarrassing is a sign of maturity you should strive for.

The way you acted towards her was pathetic. You owe her an apology.", "Alas, YTA.  Who cares if your mother ate of the kids menu?  I wish all restaurants would let people order off it.  You are in the wrong for being rude to her and I hope you apologise.", "YTA. The arrogance of your post is crazy for someone who is 19 and sooo \u2018successful\u2019. Get back down to Earth. Your family was there for you and wanted to celebrate you. That matters more than some entry level job you got at your dads company.", "YTA. Why do you mind what your mom is eating? Let her be.", "People aren't perfect. If the worst thing your mother has done to you is eat off of the kids' menu, you should be beyond grateful.

Usually I read the novels that follow because it explains the title and presents a conundrum of sorts.  Not this one.  You're a prick.  It was all your family .. meaning hers too.  How does someone's actions not involving you embarrass you?  Key word here is you.  Everything is about you.", "YTA. You owe your mother a HUGE apology. Better yet take her out to a place she loves for dinner, apologize for completely overreacting, and ask her forgiveness. Bet you a dollar all will be well. (And yes, you will pay).", "YTA.

You have no idea how hard it is for people with your mom condition. She didn\u2019t make a big scene. She let you picked the restaurant, you had to know this would happen. She didn\u2019t insist on going some place else. You chose to sulk instead of enjoying your night. You owe your mother an apology.", "YTA. \n\nWould you tell someone in a wheelchair you wish they\u2019d just walk for once and not embarrass you by having extra needs when going out? \n\nYour mom made the best of a situation where the food she could eat was only on the kids menu. Would you had rather she not eat at all?", "YTA.\n\nAlso info: have you EVER actually researched AFRID? Like actually did a ounce of research into what it actually entails? How psychologically damaging it is to a person? Let alone physically because it can cause extreme eating disorders to where a person routinely needs hospitalization in order to recover.\n\nThis condition makes her TERRIFIED to eat even foods she knows are safe. It makes her think she will choke or die if she eats the wrong food. It completely takes over her entire mindset which is why in her brain she has a VERY specific list of \"safe\" foods that she goes to without a doubt because in her mind these are the safest available to her and they won't hurt her. \n\nYou think your embarrassed? Put yourself inside HER brain, follow her diet, talk to her about her day with this, look up other people's testimonials about having this horrible condition.\n\nAnd check yourself. Because I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy. This medical condition can ultimately kill her due to malnutrition. It's THAT severe. And has gotten THAT severe for people.\n\nYour an adult go to google and research it and when your done go apologize to your mother for being a really bad child.", "YTA. It's not embarrassing at all. I am a picky eater myself and I always have to have a special request regarding the meals on the menu. E.g. If the menu says chicken breast slices covered with cheddar cheese and mushroom served with French fries and fresh salad I would order a sauce instead of the salad as it definitely contains either tomatos or cucumbers and I hate both of them. It was never a problem before however I always make sure to order something that has the same price or that is cheeper instead of the food I don't like. In very fancy restaurants I can eat barely anything but kid's food. My friend group has a habit to go to a restaurant on our birthdays and it's always the birthday girl's/boy's privilege to choose the restaurant. I really don't have a problem with kids menu because I am usually unable to eat a whole adult portion anyway.\n\nCongratulations on your job. At your age it's really time to grow up regarding other aspects of life as well because your post shows how immature you still are. Go and apologise to your mum cause you were a huge AH.", "YTA. This is one of the weirdest things I've ever seen to be mad about and you need all the therapy in existence for acting this way. \n\nWhy do you even care? It's food. The goal was to have a celebratory meal together, which she did, treating you, and you're throwing tantrums because you didn't get to dictate what she eats? You're clearly not grown-up enough to be eating in restaurants. You should leave that for when you learn some big-boy manners. Maybe when you're 50.", "YTA.  Who th hell care what she was eating. It's food and you were all together celebrating.\n\nYou're absolutely ungrateful in this situation and I'm guessing that exttends into other situations as well.  \n\nJust wow.  I hope you feel lower than low.", "YTA", "Yikes.  Yes YTA.  What she eats is none of your business.  Lots of people have issues around food.

Why do you feel the need to police someone else\u2019s food choice?  Would you berate someone allergic to seafood for eating chicken, after they were nice enough to buy YOU any seafood you wanted?   \nYou are very lucky to have a Mom who cares about you and owe her a big apology. I suggest you do something nice for her when you get your first paycheque. When you are older and have kids of your own, you are going to cringe that you treated your Mom this way.", "YTA. I can assure you that absolutely no one else in the restaurant noticed or cared what she ordered. A huge part of being an adult rests in realizing that you are not the center of the universe.", "YTA. The food on the kids menu isn't kids food. It's really no different than off the main menu, just perhaps with different options, which I assume is the case here, and smaller portion sizes. Otherwise it's the exact same food. Also, you were fully aware that your mum has an actual condition, two actually, and that affected what she could and couldn't eat. You know the reason, you know she can't help it, it's not her fault. And honestly? I highly doubt anyone except the server noticed she was eating off the kids menu, and no one but you gave a damn. I've seen adults without issues order off the kids menu plenty of times, simply because they wanted a smaller portion or an option only the kids menu had. Adults do this literally all the time. There's nothing weird about it, and she didn't embarrass you.", "You are a huge, selfish, ableist, gigantic asshole.\n\nNo one but you gives a rats ass what your mom was eating. She has a MEDICAL CONDITION and you have no empathy for the woman who sacrificed her youth to make sure you had everything you needed.\n\nGeez, the write fairly tale villains with more empathy with you. You're solutions were that you mom either starve, or suffer??? Like she not eat at all, or suffer through eating foods that make her fill I'll?? You'd do that, to your own mother???? What the hell is wrong with you?\n\nMy mother doesn't have a medical condition, but she does have a rather small palate and doesn't care to much for many foods. Do we berate her, no instead it's just a fun inside joke about how she can somehow find like chicken tenders and fries no matter what kind of restaurant we go to. Hell, I don't have a medical condition, I love trying new foods but sometimes I just want something basic and as long at the restaurant doesn't care I'll order off the kids menu too. \n\nShe didn't see anything she could eat and found a solution, no different than a vegetarian going to a steak house and only ordering sides, they wouldn't pick that restaurant but they suck it up and going bc someone they care about wants to go, she found an easy non problematic fix and you dragged her for it. \n\nYTA, caring more about appearance than your moms feelings is insane, being this aware of what someone else is eating is weird a.f, NO ONE but you cared that your mom was ordering off the kids menu, and if anyone did notice they probably just went in their heads \"make sense bc she's got that illness,\" and moved along.", "Wow, YTA. What your mom eats is not a reflection on you. You\u2019re being a jerk.", "YTA Bigtime", "YTA. That embarrassed you? YATA.", "YTA. Who cares if she eats off the children\u2019s menu. Lots of people do that. You were ungrateful and unkind to your mom, who clearly struggles. Go apologize and make this right. And get over yourself. No one is thinking about what she\u2019s eating or how that relates to you - no need to be embarrassed.", "I think you know by now that YTA, but I just wanted to say it again in case you have not figured it out. If you cannot see that she tried to give you what you wanted/deserved, you are a bit self centered in my opinion.", "YTA. \nYou know and should have expected that your mom would not be able to eat from the adults menu. And why are you embarrassed? She is who she is, love her and appreciate her.", "YTA", "YTA The only person who \u201cruined\u201d this dinner is you. Your mother did something for you because of how proud she is of your accomplishments. She probably knew she might not be able to earn there but YOU enjoy the restaurant and she did it for you. Instead of being embarrassed by what you perceive to be your mother\u2019s behavior, be embarrassed by your behavior towards your mother and family. You are young and can change and grow.

It is quite expensive but my mum was more than happy to bring me there as i had seriously loved it when my dad brought me. At the dinner my mum looked over the menu and pulled a face, i immediately knew what what going to happen. \n\nmy mum had asked for a kids menu for my 8 year old little sister and after my sister chose something off of that she looked over it. when the waitress came over we all ordered and my 37 year old mother ordered off of the kids menu. i kind of sank into my chair and had a red face all night as everyone at the table ate adult food my mum was eating kids food. \n\nWhen we got home i lost it at my mum and i might have been a complete asshole here but this is how its been my entire life, i just wanted one night were my mum would eat like a normal person and not embarrass me at a dinner that was meant to be about my success. while in the mists of me asking her why she has to be like this my mum started crying and apologising and kept repeating \"you know how hard it is for me\" and \"do you not think I'm also embarrassed\"  which is her go to whenever anyone tried to pull her up about her eating habits. \n\nMy dad later said i was an asshole for shouting at my mum when she had done so much and spent so much just so i could have a nice dinner with the whole family but i dont think i am because she could had just not eaten or ordered some bread instead of eating off the kids menu. so AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You being embarrassed by her eating issues is **YOUR** problem, not hers. It's not like she says to herself, \"Let me see how I can embarrass my son at this restaurant.\" She's literally just eating the things that, for her various issues, she is able to eat without any problems. You need to learn to be more understanding and accepting of your mom's issues. Perhaps you should educate yourself better about those issues, and try for a little compassion.", "YTA.\n\nYou\u2019re ableist and you treated your mother appallingly. Absolutely vile behaviour, you owe your mum a massive apology.", "YTA \n\nYOU were embarrassed, so you treated your mom terribly. \n\nShe isn't choosing to eat this way. It's a medical condition. She can't turn it on and off at a whim. The dinner had family there, and I'm guessing they know about her condition and eating restrictions. And, as someone with a very restricted diet due to food allergies- I understand your mom. And trust me, she IS aware of it, probably more than you. Ordering off the kids menu is not something an adult chooses to do, unless there is nothing else they can eat. \n\nYou owe her an apology. You acted very childish and rude. Your family took you out to dinner and paid for an expensive dinner. This is how you show appreciation??", "YTA\u2026in the scheme of things what your mom orders isn\u2019t important and it wouldn\u2019t have been if you hadn\u2019t overreacted", "Yta", "YTA and you know it.

Shouting at her for a medical condition beyond her control, when all she was doing is trying to celebrate you, is horrible beyond belief. \n\nThe only person who got worked up or embarrassed about the meal was you. The restaurant served it and were ok with it. The only person who made it a problem was you - one of the people she ought to be able to rely on for compassion and protection. \n\nYou abused someone because of a health condition. And that person just happened to be your mom.\n\nI hope you give her a sincere apology and do something to try and make it up to her. Some people would give anything for a supportive mom.", "YTA It\u2019s not a big deal for a grown up to order from the kids menu. You said yourself she has a diagnosis.

Your mom cannot help her food issues. You need to man up and get over it.", "YTA. What is the big deal? She did what she had to do in order to eat otherwise she would have sat there and ate nothing while everyone else ate. Would you rather she had done that? If the restaurant didn't have a problem with it then you shouldn't have a problem with it. Get over yourself it really is not that a big deal in the big picture. She can't change who she is or her medical issues. You sound like you have utterly no understanding or Sympathy For Your Mother.", "Yta, you nepo baby", "YTA. Let her eat the foods she wants. Degrading her after she doted on you is out of line.", "I have autism and while I don't have the same eating disorder as your mum I do struggle with something that many people eat and that's fish.

I can only assume this is the same thing your mum goes through, she shouldn't be expected to eat something that will make her sick and I completely understand that feeling of embarrassment as for Christmas at my boyfriends parents house (Lithuanian) I had to eat a very small amount to fit in and I was very near crying from how disgusting it was. YTA because your mum took you to your favourite restaurant and ordered something discreetly so she wouldn't feel sick and so she wouldn't have to go hungry. I WISH my parents gave that much of a damn about anything I used to do. \n\n(I would like to say as a ps that my boyfriend didn't want me to eat it and wanted me to be comfortable but his mum was having a hard time accepting me and I wanted to fit in as many of his extended family was there meeting me for the first time)", "YTA.

Grow up and do better.", "Hi YTA, I am someone who struggles with food textures, tastes etc, it doesn't matter what your mum ate, at the end of the day she's managing the best she can with her disorder. As someone who recovered from an ED, trying new foods can feel impossible, especially when it's related to the textures, tastes etc,. Put yourself in your mum's shoes for a minute man, she's autistic so potentially struggles with overstimulation, in a busy restaurant and orders something she knows she'll like and then her son decides to call her embarrassing and tell her she should have eaten some bread.   \n\n\nI really hope you apologise to your mum dude, the food doesn't matter at the end of the day she went to celebrate you and your success. What she ate has no impact on you.", "This hurt me to read on behalf of your poor mother, YTA. Sounds like your parents love you and care about you enough to take you out to a nice, expensive restaurant to celebrate you - And pay for it. It's also selfish of you to \"Wish it could just be about you.\" You were the one who made it a big deal. Your mom literally has a mental health disorder. I understand *feeling* frustrated, that's a reasonable emotion because mental health disorders can be taxing for loved ones, too, and you're only human. However the key is that you don't *act* on the frustration - You especially don't take it out on the victim.\n\nYou're young though and everyone makes mistakes.

And it's not because my parents didn't try to introduce all these foods to me as a kid.\n\nJust because you didn't end up following in your mom's footsteps with the picky eating, doesn't mean you can't learn to be empathetic towards her. \n\nAdd an autism diagnosis on-top of all of that and I couldn't even imagine the anxiety, panic attacks, almost meltdowns your mom probably HIDES from you growing up.", "YTA\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with you ?

Whats wrong with that?", "YTA \u2014 you just spent and entire post talking about how wonderful your parents have been, how much they have encouraged you and celebrated YOU for who you are. Even your own successes are a reflection of yourself AND how good they have been to you.

Her options here would be what exactly? Order something she could/would eat off the kids menu, not eat with the rest of you at all and just sit there, order something she could not eat and just sit there, she could have brought something from home or another restaurant, or just let the rest of go while she stayed home. Which of those would have been less embarrassing for you?\n\nI will say though, you did one thing right. You chose to wait to be an AH and not yell at her at the dinner. Yet another testament to the great job your parents did raising you. So there\u2019s that.\n\nEdit: Also, food is food. There is really nothing on this planet that is specifically just for kids and cannot be eaten by adults. While some find it weird even breast milk can provide sustenance and nutrition to an adult.

She\u2019s allready putting herself well out of her comfort zone just going there for you, and then you get upset over something she cannot help and attack her for it. That\u2019s so not right.\n\nTo put it into perspective my daughter is on the autistic spectrum and has ARFID (aswell as a number of other problems and conditions). Now my daughter, aswell as a vast majority of people with ARFID and asd feel uncomfortable enough in restaurants and in social situations regarding food. They already feel different, they feel judged, under pressure, they feel anxious and very uncomfortable, in some cases they feel ashamed of themselves because of their feeding disorder, the list goes on and on. Now my daughter suffers extremely bad, to the point where she has only 3 safe foods and has to rely on a special baby looking type milk formula as her sole form of nutrition and fluids as she simply cannot drink anything else, not even water. She drinks this stuff for her breakfast, lunch, dinner, and as a snack substitute. Just because she has 3 safe foods doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she will eat them on any given day.. I can\u2019t even take her to a restaurant because just being surrounded by so many people eating around her is enough and causes high anxiety and discomfort for her, she also cannot be in the dining hall at lunch times at school for the same reason. She goes to a separate room and \u201cdrinks\u201d her lunch alone with no friends apart from a teacher being in the room with her\u2026 I would give anything for my daughter to be able to eat something, even if it\u2019s something from a children\u2019s menu!..\nThankfully a few restaurants near me actually try and cater for this feeding disorder and actively encourage ARFID customers to either choose something to eat from any menu they like, or to bring their own safe food to eat in the restaurant. I wish more restaurants and cafes would follow suit and start doing this. \n\nIf I were you I would be extremely thankful to your mum, and be proud of her for being able to find something on the menu that she is happy and comfortable with eating, even if it\u2019s not \u201cadult food\u201d as you put it. What she did for you, and what she psychologically put herself through with the whole dinner planning/letting you pick type thing just simply cannot be summed up in words. You return the thanks by deeply hurting her and making her feel even more shit about herself than she allready does, over something she cannot control is just awful. All you seem to care about is how \u201cembarrassed\u201d you feel over your mother finding something she could eat at a restaurant, regardless of what it was. If I was in your position I wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed because of her, I would be proud of her in that moment and be entirely grateful. I just hope your able to learn to be more grateful and empathetic in life. A starting point might be to spend some time actually researching ARFID, and start to gain an understanding on what people with his awful feeding disorder go through. Possibly then you will be less concerned about your perfect image of what a family meal in a restaurant should look like according to you. \nTo summarise yes you are TA", "YTA \n\nHOLY.

Sadly not many people get it, I have struggled with my stepmother about it as she can not wrap her head around it, took years to get her to accommodate it in meals as she had the you do not eat it you do not eat stand point, which is not going to work when new/certain food cause vomiting if forced to consume not to mention the panic and dread and just fear of food it brings. I also have severe GI issues to boot, which makes it even worse physically for me than those I know, the GI issues can be used as an excuse to get out of some of it, though. Dietitian told me to do that, and it works with most complainers, not all sadly. I, as an adult, have tried to order off the kids menu because it has safe foods to be told no you can not do that in many places which really constructs the places you can go eat with others.

I know how that feels.
