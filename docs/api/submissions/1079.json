Their lack of direct and mature engagement when faced with these concerns, particularly for the mother of one of these adult kids, is concerning in of itself. If their reaction were to take her concerns into consideration, as egregious as they find them, and to talk things out with her then she wouldn't be pressing so hard for them to break up out of fear of this skewing and upsetting what would have been an otherwise not messy dynamic being created. Instead, it seems like their only reaction is to keep laughing in reaction to any concerns being presented, which is only driving up your wife's issues with this whole situation. If they want to be considered two adults in a separate and serious relationship from what's going on between you and your future wife, then they need to act like adults and actually address this situation in a way that's constructive and gets results. Not laughing their asses off at her for being scared of what this means for her.\n\nYour future wife also is an AH here, for obvious reasons. She also needs to come to terms with the facts that these are two adults who have within all of their rights decided to be in a relationship with each other before the information of your serious commitment to one another came to light. They didn't start dating to spite their parents. They started dating because they genuinely like each other. It's not her call to tell them to break up because you two are together now, but they need to be able to hear out the more reasonable end of her concerns (because that's not the reasonable end).\n\nWhat I think would benefit you and this situation most is to have a talk with this young couple about priorities. Focus on priorities and frame all of your questions around priorities.\n\n*\"Where do you prioritize this new relationship that I shouldn't make assumptions about in your life currently? You need to make it clear to us how you want the two of you to be regarded and treated in this dynamic, regardless if it's a new relationship. How do you think this bodes for family gatherings in the future? If we were to ever want to gather our blended families in a room together for a celebration and your relationship didn't pan out, what would that look like? Would you two be able to make nice for the duration of this? Would you both draw straws and take turns as to who gets to see the family this time around? Or do neither of you want to attend these (hypothetical) future gatherings at all?\"*\n\n*\"Is your new relationship such a high priority in your life that (to the gf) you would end your relationship with your mother? Because your mother will not want to be a part of this dynamic should this continue.\"*\n\nIf all those two can give you is more laughter and jokes in response to you trying to understand where they stand in their relationship, how they prioritize their relationship currently in life and how they plan to proceed for the future, then that's all the answer you need that these two aren't mature or serious enough in their relationship to be taken seriously. I would make that clear to them if I were in your position if that's how they were to respond. They need to understand that where they stand in their relationship and how this relationship is positioned in their lives plays a huge influence in how you and your wife will approach and regard this situation. If they can't handle a single proper adult conversation to figure out where the lines should be drawn and how this should be approached then they're just being AHs. \n\nI won't lie, my own personal biases influence the judgement I've made here. Quite frankly, I can see where your wife is coming from and why this is so upsetting for her. Both my husband and I are in agreement that we would be wildly uncomfortable if we somehow had children that weren't biologically related dating one another. He comes from a family that adheres strongly to their culture and he can't even begin to guess how he would present his hypothetical adult kid's relationship to his family in a manner that doesn't leave the young couple getting berated and denounced by an entire branch of family for engaging in a relationship that's highly disrespectful to the values of family, loyalty, and fostering peace. In my husband's culture, as much as I have my issues with this and don't think it should be like this, it's a clear cut case of public ostracizing if he were to be in the same position as you are. I'm talking being shunned at the local temple level of public ostracizing. Divorce is already highly frowned upon in his culture, with the exception of abuse and neglect cases. For two people to be remarrying while also having two children in a relationship with each other would not end with gossip and the occasional dirty or judgemental stare, it would mean being cut off from the community save for those who are close enough to want to keep you in their individual lives. I haven't been in Montana for stretches of time, but my general impression of Montana is that a lot of folk there tend to be religious and highly value things like family, loyalty, integrity, and value being able to demonstrate pride in these aspects of their life. I struggle to see how news of two children of a married couple also being in a relationship would NOT create issues for the two of you depending on your line of work, which communities you're involved in, and so on. And from where you stand, it's not unfair for you and your wife to be taking this into consideration. \n\nHere's my final and maybe most important piece: What looks good on paper often doesn't pan out nearly as smoothly and simply when it happens in the real world that's full of complexities. **\"You shouldn't care about what other people think,\"** is a **fantastic** concept on paper and truly words people should put more effort into living by. I do my best to live by those words, within reason. What's there on paper doesn't acknowledge that a messy or bad social reputation does in fact impact a whole lot of elements in life. For example, nowadays somebody can easily skyrocket into online infamy by posting a bigoted statement or being recorded when they harass a stranger with bigotry. They're identified in the real world, and the consequences of losing their job, support from their community, and literally being recognized in the streets for what they did all follow. Somebody having a bad social reputation in say, a small town, will struggle more to find work and community support than somebody who hasn't been through things like legal trouble or publicized family/household problems. \n\nOn paper the situation is, **\"These are two adults with independent lives who began dating before they knew their parents were in a serious commitment.\"** On paper it's hard to see anything wrong with this situation. But in real life it isn't nearly as straightforward and mess-free. Generally speaking, it's not wrong for stepparents to want their teenaged or adult stepchildren to form some level of connection within a newly blended family. It is wrong for stepparents to expect teen/adult stepchildren to feel immediately ingrained and obligated to a brand new branch of family that they didn't grow up with or receive prior support from, but we're not talking about extreme and unreasonable expectations here. What I'm getting at is, depending on the families being blended through this marriage, there's going to be confusion and judgement. In most cases, it's confusion that can be cleared up and remedied so I'm not over here forecasting doom. But it's not something you'll be able to do the heavy lifting in solo or only with your wife, these two children are adults and they will need to have some level of engagement in helping extended family navigate this new dynamic and how they want to be treated and addressed, that's if they want to be involved in the family in general. \n\nTLDR; Wife needs to readjust her response to highlight her actual concerns instead of trying to impose a change that's not her choice to make. The kids are adults and are in an adult relationship and need to handle themselves accordingly instead of only making the situation worse by treating it like a joke. ESH, except for OP.", "NTA.

A month later they get identical save the dates in the mail, one of them sees it on the others' fridge, \"Oh hey, what a small world! That's my mom's wedding! Do you know the bride or the groom?\" \"... The groom. It's my father. I... Well, this is a disturbing insight into whether attraction has a familial component.\"", "It happens. I remember one of the very few times I saw my late fiance (bf at the time) cry was when he saw his dad's wedding photos on Facebook. No one told him anything and he'd never heard of the woman. He was fairly upset.\n\nThis sounds like OP probably isn't very close with his son.", "It happens.  I met my stepfather once before my mother married him.  I was married and had kids already, and lived 200 miles away.  Neither of my sisters met him before they married.  \n\nWe weren\u2019t invited to the wedding.  His two who were minors were, though.  It was the strangest thing.  To this day, I wonder why they handled it how they did.  At least my MIL invited her son to the the Friday afternoon wedding they had.", "The kids are adults and they live far away its not overall that surprising especially with Covid and other travel problems limiting in person meetups", "My dad & stepmom. I first met her some weeks after their wedding. Fortunately, she's cool.", "They could have met each of them and not realized the two were dating\u2014easy enough if they visited separately, especially since it seems like the relationship between the kids is pretty new.", "Each other's _grown_ children? I don't know, that seems pretty normal to me. My MIL got married a couple years ago and we never have (and probably never will) meet her new husband's grown children. Once you're an adult, your parent getting married doesn't mean you have a new step-family. It just means that, hey, Mom and Mike are married now. Cool. Doesn't change a thing about your life.", "Hey OP, think about it this way. It\u2019s actually kind of **convenient** and **unifying**. Now any grandchildren they have (should your children stay together) will be biologically both of yours .\n\nNormal blended families struggle with favoritism when it comes to things like wedding expenses, time spent with grandchildren, etc. You might not have to worry about any of that. Explain it to your wife and see what she thinks.", "But it\u2019s a very important distinction. They aren\u2019t stepbrother and stepsister yet. Have never met under that context. How long have you and your fianc\u00e9 been together? Y\u2019all really don\u2019t sound close enough to your children to ask them to stop seeing each other.", "But it\u2019s the proper word. If you\u2019re going to use wife, use it from the start so no one is questioning you about it.", "Am I the only one who thinks it's weird that you would plan a wedding without introducing your partner to your kids??? Even over video call??", "Yeah I was confused, I thought it was his ex-wife who had the problem! If it's his Fianc\u00e9e, she can tell her own daughter to break up!", "I use fiancee and husband sort of interchangeably, or sometimes fiancband. We're civil unioned and engaged to be married. Basically just a different set of paperwork, but we chose to get civil unioned now while we wait for the world to stop burning so we can have a nice wedding.", "The \u201ckids\u201d are adults and not related.  None of this is their problem.", "Definitely! The ESH is pointed towards OP and his fiancee, not the kids", "I don't talk to my mother about my relationships because any mention of a date will result in an interrogation demanding no less than 3 generations of information about him and his family. Gotta be really serious to deal with that level of crazy.\n\nThat's too excessive, but normally the parents ask a kids SO's name..... same name, same place- parents should have figured it out. They literally sent invites to both their children without figuring it out.", "> I do find it odd that presumably holidays have happened while they've been together\n\nEasily could be son went to mom's for Thanksgiving, dad's for Christmas. Daughter did the same so they weren't at the same holiday. I met my SIL but none of her family before my brother's wedding.", "Or just, they live near other family members and it's still technically a pandemic? They could know their parent has a new partner, even that the partner has a kid, but they don't nescisarilly know the kids name. And not everyone says their parents names to introduce them, or it could just be extremely common. And if say, one isn't close at all to their kid, like it sounds like the fiancee may not be? Then maybe there haven't been pictures to connect the dots yet.", "My oldest brother was out of the house already, and I was a senior in highschool. My stepdad didn't really want to get involved with us, but he loved my mom. My mom loved him too, and we were both old enough we didn't really care who she dated it didn't affect us. They eloped and I was going to grab the trashcan to put back when my neighbor hollered at me and asked how I liked my mom's new husband. I asked what he was talking about because as far as I knew she wasn't married. He pulled out the local news paper which list recent marriages of locals and showed me. In my anger at the moment I snatched the paper out his hands, left the trashcan, and went to ask my mom what the hell?!  It's been like 12 years since then and he's done more for me than my own father, and still doesn't know I scraped against his Audi on accident later that year\n\nOn my drive to school I called my brother, who also didn't know. He was also pretty mad. We barely knew him at the time and were kinda assholes honestly. We'd call him Russian to try and upset him (Lithuanian) and other dumb stuff. So I kinda get it in hindsight, still though a heads up would've been nice\n\nEdit 11 years and I was a Junior I think", "Yeah, he always treated me as less than. My sisters (younger, still in elementary school) had met him and everything was cool with them. 20 years later, I haven't seen him in person for 5+ years and I see my mom maybe 1-2x a year and we don't talk much more than that.", "Lmao, My mother has the same logic but about me having a gf : Basically, she wants to meet the girl I like BEFORE we even start dating because \"I don't want it to be too serious and it'd be easier for you to part ways that way\"", "But in this case, the \u201cchildren\u201d are in their 20\u2019s living on their own.  This is not like Greg shagging Marcia (1970\u2019s TV culture reference for those who don\u2019t get the reference). They are not looking to the new spouse as a parent.", "Don\u2019t really see that w adult kids, as here. That\u2019s generally w juvenile kids", "I find myself a bit torn on the issue. If I ever got divorced and played the dating game again (which would never happen because of the horror stories. My inner introvert dies a little thinking about it.) I wpuldnt want them to meet my kids untilclater on but at the same point I'd not continue a relationship where the kids didnt accept the other.", "> And then parents post here wondering why their children can't see their new spouse as a parent\n\nRight? Like \u201cwhy won\u2019t you trust my judgment that Mr./Mz. Right #2-10 would make a great daddy/mommy for you?\u201d", "Yeah, the guy my mom married was a little better - he was an OTR semi driver, so he was gone for 4 days a week. I had already been doing most of the parenting for my sisters prior to my mom getting married, so not much changed there. \n\nParents suck so hard some times", "I like your name!", "Lololol, it's a good side tangent for me - my step dad has 5 kids who I had no idea about until they had been married for about 3 months. Found out when 2 of them showed up for visitation.\n\nHe was actually a decent dad to them, way more present in their lives than mine for sure even though they didn't live with him.", "He's a pretty chill dude, I would have been happy to celebrate them lol", "Ellensburg is a college town. My parents actually met there.", "[removed]", "I didn\u2019t let my parents meet my husband until we got engaged? They didn\u2019t see pictures or anything. \n\nSome people have private lives and don\u2019t put everything on social media.", "Well, I have no idea if that's what happened, but based on this pitch, I would read your treatment and maybe option the script if I like it. :-)", "So June is the shameless hussy that Frank is cheating on Jane with?", "As a Montanan, I'm laughing at \"Big City\". Because there's only one... And it's not really that big...", "This was my thought as well. How weird can it make things if you don\u2019t really have a relationship with them already? If my parent or even sibling didn\u2019t think I deserved to be informed of major life events until so late and so impersonal as a wedding invitation, I would not plan my life around them. \n\nIf they\u2019d known when you got serious, their new relationship probably wouldn\u2019t have ever started. But that\u2019s not the choice you made. These are the consequences. Honestly how much do you even see your kids for it to matter?\n\nEdit: To answer the actual question, YTA for not shutting your partner down. These aren\u2019t kids. Now that they are actually informed they can see if it\u2019s worth it going forward, but that\u2019s not your wife\u2019s choice.", "Maybe you and your fiancee should break up. Then your son and her daughter could keep dating and your fiancee won't think its weird at all.", "They can be close to their children, but when kids are adults and live far away, it isn't inconceivably that they've never met their future step siblings.   OP may have already introduced his son to his fiance, and been introduced to her daughter, but if the kids have been dating for less than a year, it isnt far fetched that they haven't introduced to the parents.  \n\nI'm more surprised they didn't find out through social media.", "I dunno, did OP say they didn't ever introduce the partner? Like if OP introduces their kid to the fiancee, how would they recognize who it was, outside of being their parents fiancee?", "But you wouldn't necessarily introduce your partner's kids to your kids. And if I had a parent who was remarrying, I'd be interested in whether the proposed spouse was a good person, whether they made my parent happy, what they did for work, what their hobbies were and so on. The details of their adult children would be a long way down the list.", "Maybe the first reasonable explanation I've heard for doing this but probably still confusing for some people.", "I never said it was. Only you got the timeframe backwards, and OP and Mom were dating first.", "I get your point but Michael is a silly name to use to illustrate it. I had 5 Michaels in my middle school class of 60 and live on a street with my neighbors Mike, Michael, Mikey, and Little Mike.  \n\nI'm just saying, if someone told me that they had a kid named Michael, I would not be curious about whether they're the Michael I know from an entirely different state.", "I mean yeah, your mother marrying a man in secret when you were still living in her house is fucking weird", "I don't know how anyone could have expected you to take that WELL...? Being assholes isn't great but your mom set everyone up for failure.", "This is hilarious, it totally deserves its own post to be analyzed in detail! Briefly I'll say the power structure in your relationship is what makes the difference, she is responsible for you, you are not responsible for her.", "Besides if the mum thought it was \"weird\" from a \"step-siblings shagging\" pov, honey that ship has probably sailed. \nOh no, the wife-to-be is kicking up a fuss at what other people think. Way to prioritise other people's gossip over your kinds actual happiness. Hell no OP, not on your watch- sit the fiancee down and talk this out or You will be the asshole to keep half-heartedly supporting this crappy break-up idea.", "> Greg shagging Marcia\n\nCalling this a \"70s TV reference\" instead of a \"Brady Bunch reference\" just made me feel very old.", "I think I could easily see that the parents don't know who the kids are dating, but still seems pretty surprising that this didn't come up anyway.   I mean it's a pretty strange coincidence that they both live in Montana and have children living in the same city in a different state.   Seems like a fun tidbit that would get passed around during a normal conversation, then when OP calls Greg and says his GF has a daughter Marcia that lives near you.", "I think the point is to have priorities. The kids are first, the new person is second. Which means that you protect your kids until you are sure about the new person, and take their negative opinion as a dealbreaker. Or in other words, first you date and make sure you like the person, then later you introduce them to your kids, and if the kids say no (after reasonable efforts are made) then you don't move in together or force them down the kids throats.", "Thanks!!", "Bot stole part of a comment from /u/fire-sign.

The \"big city\" there is, like I suspect is true for Montana, exactly the sort of size where this shit would happen--just big enough that you wouldn't immediately jump to I BET YOU KNOW... and entirely unsurprising when you do. Once met a taxi driver who'd spent a couple of childhood summers about 30 minutes from my grandparents' little town, which meant his cousins very likely went to school with my mother or her siblings. We were in England.", "Yeah, this exactly! The kids might have met their parent's fianc\u00e9/\u00e9 but not have met at the same time or with the right context until the invites showed up!", "Very true, I was thinking more of a let's get the kids together so the can meet kind of thing but maybe it's just me who thinks this would be normal \ud83d\ude02", "All valid points i agree with, guess it is just me then on the kids thing  lol", "Oh yeah, it's really confusing. I love it.", "Especially since I wouldn't be surprised if Fiancee's daughter says she's from Washington, not Montana due to living with her father there. There's no reason to make the connection to Montana unless the name is so unique it's bizarre.", "Yeah. I probably gotta do apost abt it. But it basically was a long conversation", "That's actually the only part of this I believe. Washington is the type of state where a lot of population is concentrated in a few cities, has a lot of opportunity, and is not quite far enough away from Montana to be logistically difficult to move directly there, especially when pursuing college or career. It's a safe bet that *most* people moving to Washington from a different state are probably going to either Vancouver or Seattle metro area, for example.\n\nNow, if the parents live in White Sulphur Springs and the kids both live in Goldendale, then yea super strange coincidence haha", "Seriously, my kids don't tell me about every single person they date/dated (one is married).  Not once they were out on their own. It's a bit silly, I think.", "Not if the kids are adults and on their own. Sometimes kids are weird because they don't want you dating. They either want you back with the old parent, or are freaked out about you dating, in general, or any other weird combination.  Unless they have a damn good reason, when my kids are not living with me, they don't get say in my life, not like that.", "I'm fairly certain that this exact circumstance has been on the Hallmark channel at least once in the last 20 years.....\n\nNTA OP \n\nStep siblings over 18 with no relation by blood is NOT incest. Like your son thinks, it's just a funny happenstance. It's only a scandal if you LET it be a scandal. Your fianc\u00e9 is being ridiculous.", "Oh yeah. I imagine it's similar. OPs story isn't surprising to me at all. In high school, my sister had a crush on a guy... Until our parents started dating. Even after they broke up, my sister couldn't look at her old crush the same way again!", "Probably if they still lived closer or a minor kid was involved. The parents are adults & it's a later in life relationship, the kids are adults with study/work life far away. With phonecalls etc. I could totally see a random coincidence like this happening! XD\n\n But I'm not american & the two states mentioned seem very far apart. Like I live in Ireland, my sibling lives in mainland europe, & so I could see in-person meetings not happening until the big day? Especially with the last few years of Covid!", "Through no fault of the son. They knew their kids were dating and they got engaged.\n\nAnd while you (and OP) are right, I'm just replying to the comment of yours saying that OP in fact was not acting like there's \"nothing wrong with it\", he did call it weird, strange and interesting.", "Last year I read the summary of every Hallmark and Hallmark adjacent film new for the year. Its probably happened EVERY year and one of the less contrived setups.", "I'm in Ireland as well \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02 \nGuess I can see something like this happening but with video calls and everything I just find it a bit strange is all", "Lol didn't see your username!

Just because of the distances involved, they're all in different countries & don't meet up regularly. like we all saw each other at a funeral recently. So i could sorta see an in person meeting happening at a wedding, especially with covid!", "NTA.  This isn't as uncommon as you might think, even in merged families.  It's also legal, even in the South.", "Well, first of all, she is not his step sister if y\u2019all aren\u2019t married", "Thanks. What's nuts is that ~25 years later and he still believes he did nothing wrong and doesn't understand why I haven't accepted his second family with open arms yet\u2014it still baffles me how someone can be *so* out of touch.\nETA: just saw your posts about your dad.
