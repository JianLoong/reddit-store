I love him dearly, and we've had a great relationship, with very few arguments or fights. He has a kid (15NB) from a different relationship who I love as my own child. I have lost my uncle, father, grandma, sister, and my child. I have a memorial piece for each of them, but for my child (20 when he died) I have a full sleeve full of his favorite things, his name, bday, and death date. It takes up my shoulder down to my wrist, and has very little room. Its filled with birds as he loved birds, chess pieces (the focal point is a full black king with his name, bday, and death date near it as he was a king before he passed) and a lot of other things he loved. It was heartbreaking for me, and with this tattoo its kind of like he's still here with me, and he never knew his step-sister as he died before they met. Hubby and I were still in the dating stage by then, not serious yet.\n\nAnyhow, I have a few smaller tats other than my memorial pieces, but they're very tiny. I do have room on my body for more. My husband asked me if I'd get his kid's name tatted on my sons memorial piece. I told him no. He asked if I'd consider getting it somewhere else. Again, I told him no. He asked why, and i told him that I don't tattoo names for people who aren't dead, or are not close family. He accused me of not loving my stepchild. I told him I did, but its not the same and I don't want to ruin my sons memorial piece. He then said \"Oh come on. You don't want kids and have tattooed yourself for other men, so the least you can do is get a tat for me and my child.\"\n\nMy jaw DROPPED. I told him smt like \"My uncle is my bio family, and was very close to me growing up and you know that. I'm not branding myself for you. The reason why I don't want anymore kids is b/c I lost one to schizophrenia. It has a genetic component and i had other family members with it so ik its me. I can't watch another kid suffer. And also, we're too old at this point.\"\n\nMy step-kid barged into the room at this point and told their father to stop. He told them to stop defending me, and to defend him. My step-kid said \"It's mom's body and no one else's! That's such a shallow and low move of you to bring up her family! Just stop!\" and then turned to me, took my hands in theirs and said \"Mama please, don't do anything with your body you don't want too. I'm so sorry.\" and then hugged me.

(3) Your husband inability to not see the difference between the relationship between you and your late bio uncle and the difference between you and \"a man\" is telling. It is telling on his views of the relationship between men and women, on his views of the agency of the owner of a female body (I'm sorry for the way I worded it, English is not my first language) and on his views of acceptable ways to express affection. (TL;DR : It says more about him than about you)\n\nThe behaviour you described is callous and unacceptable. Like many other OPs, you'll tell us to not judge your husband based on this one interaction, that he is usually loving and respectful and that relationships are complex and multifaceted so we can't judge him for this one outburst when you guys share a history of mutual respect and support. \"He's not like that usually\" or something. \"Don't jump to Reddit's favorite relationship advice\" and all. \n\nI would still like to say that trying to browbeat you into engaging in body modifications that you don't want because he is insecure about your relationship with your uncle, screaming, storming out, calling you vile names, etc. are not the actions of a loving and respectful person. In your shoes, I would at least* demand a solid and sincere apology that contains no non-apologies and real amends. \n\nNTA, but make sure he doesn't get away with it.\n\n\\* \"at least\" because this jab at your tattoos and your not having any more children is divorce worthy in *my* book", "There's a scene in \"The Right Stuff\", where a new test pilot walks into a pilot's bar.

If (and we all hope not) he were to die before you, you woudl want a piece for him, and not as an afterthought to your son.\n\nI did hear of a Grandma recently who, after that grandchild had a memorial tattoo done for some other family member, surprised everyone by saying she loved the idea so much, she just wished hers could be done before she passed so she could enjoy it.  And the way I'm describing that sounds really vile - it was known that the Grandchild woudl eventually get a memorial tattoo for their Grandma, so it wasn't a demand.\n\nAnyway, that's a bit of a side tangent of a thought that if your husband really wanted his name tattooed (even sounds like the 15NB is not as important, given the rant), and if he calmed down enough to actually appologise, and understand that these are memorial tattoos, and that he'd behaved really unacceptably....IF ALL that....then maybe he would want to be part of designing what you'd have, should you need a memorial tattoo for him.
