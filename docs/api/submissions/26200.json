It can be physical, verbal, or written but the result is that it causes harm. What harm did it do her to ask her to stop talking about personal, inappropriate topics?\n\nKink shaming is making someone feel like they are wrong or disgusting for how they express their sexuality.

Or maybe just making you uncomfortable by discussing sex.\n\nYou were right to report her after she ignored multiple requests to stop. You had no other choice.", "Oversharing in this manner, especially repeatedly after someone has asked you to stop, is actually a type of sexual harassment.\n\nSexual harassment can be verbal, physical, or visual. It would not be appropriate for her to show you photos of her and her husband engaged in pegging at work, so why would it be okay for her to graphically describe it to you at work? If it would not be okay for her to share a graphically written story of sexual escapades with you at work, why is it okay for her to tell you these stories?\n\nShe\u2019s approaching you habitually with graphic sexual descriptions against your explicitly expressed wishes not to receive them. That is absolutely HR territory, and do not for one second question whether or not you did the right thing. No matter how she reacts (in fact, if she approaches you upset and saying you shouldn\u2019t have reported it, I would take that to HR as well). \n\nJust imagine for a moment if it was a male colleague doing the *exact* same thing. The same rules apply. It\u2019s not different because she\u2019s a woman. \n\nAnd if she\u2019s saying you should have given her more warning \u2026 it\u2019s generally a bad idea to warn someone that you intend to approach HR. It gives them a chance to create a counter-narrative or beat you to the punch. You told her not to do it again because it made you uncomfortable. That is explicit nonconsent. That WAS her explicit warning. \n\nYou did the right thing.", "I don't think its that uncommon to know amongst work place friends. I do think when someone says stop thats the end of it tho.", "This. It almost doesn't matter WHAT the conversation was about. OP asked Brenda to stop bringing up the subject so that should be the end of it.
