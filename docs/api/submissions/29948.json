His sister is shit, and is being enabled by their shit parents.\n\nIf I had a kid on the way and a sibling said that, I'd cut them off, and anyone who defended it. Because what's next? Telling a 6 year old Santa doesn't exist? Telling a kid that it could've had a sibling but it died? Sending a card for the baby shower saying \"At least this one survived!\"?\n\nPeople put family on a pedestal like the evil shit they do and enable should be brushed under the rug because faaaamily. They are no more special than any other person just because of genetics. If you do or enable shit like what happened with op, you clearly don't care about your family and don't deserve to be in their lives. Because if they overlooked THIS SHIT I guarantee there's been other equally toxic situations and there'll be more after as well. \n\nIf someone is 19, and thinks a comment like that is \"edgy\" or \"dark humor\" they need therapy or a harsh reality check before someone does something worse than just yelling at them.

Your sister knew it would hurt you and especially your pregnant wife which in turn hurts your unborn son. She is already knowingly hurting your son, she is not a good person let alone aunt. And your family defending her rather than the hurt party (your wife and soon to be son) means they don\u2019t deserve to be part of this time.

Honestly, there are so many red flags here with your family-how they've let your sister get away with this kind of behavior for years and then got angry with you for standing up to her? That's very alarming. When I met my husband, he had two teenage sisters who were \"edgy\" and \"wacky\" and \"brutally honest\". They said extremely inappropriate things, used profanity anywhere, laughed at inappropriate times and my in laws just ignored, made excuses, enabled. Ten years later they are two of the most worthless \"adults\" anybody has ever seen. They drove their parents to divorce and now they live together like Patty and Selma on The Simpsons, in my father in law's basement. Neither one is allowed contact with my child. Your mileage may vary, but I think you'd be wise to start setting some very firm boundaries and making a plan to stick to them when they are inevitably challenged or violated, because believe me, they will be. Good for you for standing up for your poor wife where she could see it- I cannot imagine how awful all this has been for her. She is very vulnerable and needs your protection, so keep that Big Daddy Energy and keep your horrible sister away from your little family, I can almost guarantee that she'll try to top the previous shocking thing she said.", "NTA- OP- They defended that?

Like others here I too can have a dark sense of humour, sometimes even a bit warped.

Your dad yelling at you for quite rightly calling out your sisters behaviour makes him as ignorant as your sister. Do neither of them realise this so called \"joke\" was about a person who died? The daughter of your wife and you; and their niece and grandchild. There was nothing harsh about what you said or did. In my view it was totally understandable in the circumstances.", "NTA. \n\nHanna doesn't lack sympathy, she lacks empathy...in a way that sounds almost clinical.

I\u2019m actually more concerned about OP\u2019s parents than the sister. Her comment was way out of bounds, but given the father\u2019s defense of her, one wonders what kind of socialization and upbringing she\u2019s had.\n\nAs frequently is the case in these situations, the immediate issue (lacking the judgement to not say that out loud) pales in comparison to a much bigger concern: people who genuinely don\u2019t understand why this is monstrous might have other major (and dangerously unpredictable) gaps in their behavior or judgement. And if they do understand and are just pretending OP is overreacting because they favor the sister (though such \u201cfavoritism\u201d is really no favor at all), that points to significant problems with their character. \n\nOP should strongly consider limiting contact (especially for his wife\u2019s sake, if not also his own) and definitely shouldn\u2019t plan to leave the baby alone with these people.

He'll, there's even dead baby jokes.\n\nThen there's purposely making fun of a person's tragedy. \n\nNo.\n\nWhen it comes to humor, you take your cues from the person more affected.
