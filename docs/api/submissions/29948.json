His sister is shit, and is being enabled by their shit parents.\n\nIf I had a kid on the way and a sibling said that, I'd cut them off, and anyone who defended it. Because what's next? Telling a 6 year old Santa doesn't exist? Telling a kid that it could've had a sibling but it died? Sending a card for the baby shower saying \"At least this one survived!\"?\n\nPeople put family on a pedestal like the evil shit they do and enable should be brushed under the rug because faaaamily. They are no more special than any other person just because of genetics. If you do or enable shit like what happened with op, you clearly don't care about your family and don't deserve to be in their lives. Because if they overlooked THIS SHIT I guarantee there's been other equally toxic situations and there'll be more after as well. \n\nIf someone is 19, and thinks a comment like that is \"edgy\" or \"dark humor\" they need therapy or a harsh reality check before someone does something worse than just yelling at them.

Honestly, there are so many red flags here with your family-how they've let your sister get away with this kind of behavior for years and then got angry with you for standing up to her? That's very alarming. When I met my husband, he had two teenage sisters who were \"edgy\" and \"wacky\" and \"brutally honest\". They said extremely inappropriate things, used profanity anywhere, laughed at inappropriate times and my in laws just ignored, made excuses, enabled. Ten years later they are two of the most worthless \"adults\" anybody has ever seen. They drove their parents to divorce and now they live together like Patty and Selma on The Simpsons, in my father in law's basement. Neither one is allowed contact with my child. Your mileage may vary, but I think you'd be wise to start setting some very firm boundaries and making a plan to stick to them when they are inevitably challenged or violated, because believe me, they will be. Good for you for standing up for your poor wife where she could see it- I cannot imagine how awful all this has been for her. She is very vulnerable and needs your protection, so keep that Big Daddy Energy and keep your horrible sister away from your little family, I can almost guarantee that she'll try to top the previous shocking thing she said.", "NTA- OP- They defended that?

He had to turn it off, and I still can't bring myself to ever watch that movie). So, having your worst fears come to reality during that time is extra awful.
