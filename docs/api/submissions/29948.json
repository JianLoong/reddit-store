If you have a dark sense of humor, you absolutely must learn that there\u2019s a time and a place for it.

I have never lost a child, but I have seen friends who have and saw how devastating it was for them. Joking about the death of their child when they were expecting again would make me a monster. Your sister is old enough to understand social boundaries, and if she doesn't yet, then this is a good time to learn them. Your dad isn't helping by leaping to her defence. Ignore your dad, but if I were you, I would have a proper talk with the sister and explained to her why her comment wasn't acceptable. She might defend herself and said that's just a dark joke or whatever and this will be a good opportunity for you to explain that jokes aren't meant to hurt other people, especially when they have trauma like you and your wife.", "NTA, harsh would have been saying, \"At least that one didn't turn out like you.\"\n\nYou may have been unkind in your corrections, but at least you cared enough to try and correct her.

Bad jokes can make you avoid reality. \n\nBut it wasn't her pregnancy, it was someone else's.

But it is common sense by age 13 to not basically say \"Well, let's hope this baby doesn't die too\".\n\n19 is more than fucking old enough to know not to say that. His sister is shit, and is being enabled by their shit parents.\n\nIf I had a kid on the way and a sibling said that, I'd cut them off, and anyone who defended it. Because what's next? Telling a 6 year old Santa doesn't exist? Telling a kid that it could've had a sibling but it died? Sending a card for the baby shower saying \"At least this one survived!\"?\n\nPeople put family on a pedestal like the evil shit they do and enable should be brushed under the rug because faaaamily. They are no more special than any other person just because of genetics. If you do or enable shit like what happened with op, you clearly don't care about your family and don't deserve to be in their lives. Because if they overlooked THIS SHIT I guarantee there's been other equally toxic situations and there'll be more after as well. \n\nIf someone is 19, and thinks a comment like that is \"edgy\" or \"dark humor\" they need therapy or a harsh reality check before someone does something worse than just yelling at them. A mindset like that over something so sensitive WILL cause a knee jerk reaction. If at 19 I heard that a friend got knocked out for saying something like that, they'd get zero sympathy for acting like a damn sociopath.\n\nFuck that shit.
