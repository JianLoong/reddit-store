It sucks that your father is telling you all of this after she already passed, since she's not able to correct him. I understand where your anger is coming from, and that's why I don't think you were the ah.\n\nStill, think of your mom. You promised her you wouldn't hold it against him. If you keep all of this anger inside of you, it's only going to make you more miserable as life goes on. Think of your mom whenever you want to lash out again.", "NTA.  You had just lost your Mom and were grieving when your Dad insulted her memory, and you slammed him for it.  It was mean, but understandable.  It sounds like your Mom wants you to be at peace where your Dad is concerned, so don't cling to your anger about the past.  Try to figure out if you want any kind of relationship with your Dad based on what you can forgive and how you feel.  If you really feel that you don't want your Dad in your life, you will figure out other options than depending on him.", "NTA but I would tell you something that I have learned in my time on this planet. Anger is the poison we feed ourselves to punish others. You need to make peace with what and who your father is. He is half of you and he is not perfect in the least. It would seem that he loves you and that he is trying now. \n\nDo what you want and look out for you but the goal is to feel serene, at peace, and even love and gratitude no matter what", "I just want to say you\u2019re one of those ice cold and scary when angry types. I sort of salute you. \n\nTry to let go of your anger. It\u2019s like drinking poison.", "Editing to NTA with the further info given.  \n\n\nINFO. Some ages would be helpful... are you stuck living with your dad because you're underage or is everyone adults here? What was the situation with your dad when you were growing up? Was he around much? Has he always spoken this way of your mom or is this new? What was your parents relationship like? There's so much missing, but I realize there's a character limit.\n\nFrom the info given, I'd lean toward NTA because he brought the conversation to that point. When you're dealing with people who recently lost a loved one, you need to read the room and he obviously didn't. Anyway it goes, I'm sorry for what you're going thru and hope you're able to find some peace with it all soon. It sucks to lose a parent at any age, but especially when you're young. It's really easy to grab onto the pain and anger because it seems better than letting yourself fall into the real grief and letting go of what feels like the little you have left of them. Please know there's beautiful memories on the other side of the anger and pain. It took me way too long to learn that, so I hope you do better than I did.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your loss. The best thing your dad ever did was to help make you. Take care of yourself.", "INFO. I can't tell if he was trying to hurt you intentionally as you sound like you were to him. It's hard to tell if you have reasons to hate him and refuse his seeming attempts to make it up to you, at least beyond him disrespecting your mother which could be reason enough I suppose. If he's been a parent who raised you, then whomever made her pregnant isn't that important honestly.", "ESH. It sounds like there are some questionable circumstances about what happened between your mom and your dad where nobody really knows what happened. Including you.", "I'm sorry for your loss. Losing a parent is never easy, and especially losing your sole parent. It's harder still when you're trying to work out who you are and how to be independent etc. I hope you're being kind to yourself.\n\nRegarding your conversation with your dad, you were harshly honest. You were grieving and your dad was insensitive. It's probably a wash there.\n\nIt sounds like he's been a terrible father but he's trying to be there for you now. It's a lot easier to establish yourself as an adult if you have access to well meaning family members with resources and a willingness to help you. You don't have to like your dad to accept his help, but it helps. You certainly should not accept his help while plotting his demise.\n\nLet the bad stuff go. You've got a long life ahead and it's easier to move forward with civility rather than rancour. ESH", "\"I might need him\"\n\nYTA. Possibly E S H. You alluded to bad things your Dad did but didn't tell us what, so I can't judge that. But this is a man you despise and look down on, but you don't want to ruin the connection to must because you might need to use him. That makes you TA", "YTA. I get that that's your mom, but people do that stuff all the time. It's not unreasonable for him to have thought that at the time. Definitely didn't deserve you insulting him like this. And they way you talk about wanting to keep the relationship going in case you can get something out of him? Really fucking gross", "I mean, your mom killed herself and your dad is beside himself.  It sounds like you heard a bunch of truth bombs you didn't like. \n\n\nHe shouldn't have said all that, but it seems like its from grief and confusion more than malice. You tore him apart when he told you his deepest darkest secret. I'm sure the relationship will be wierd for a while. I'm going neither of you is the asshole.

Ive seen a bunch of people comment on how anger is poison and you need to let it go. I\u2019ve been told similar things for the anger I have at my mother and my ex. \n\nTo get emotional about emotional things *is normal*. It is true that, to an extent, anger can be a poison *if you hold it in and let it fester* or if you try to bury it down deep without acknowledgment. The anger I have (and there\u2019s a *lot* of it) doesn\u2019t burn or eat away at me; I\u2019ve had that type of anger before, lived in it for *years*, and this is so different from it. The way I see it, is that I\u2019ve *earned* my anger. For me, it\u2019s my inner self acknowledging what they both (separately) put me through and that it was *not* ok in any way shape or form. It is reasonable to be angry about that. \n\nIf what you\u2019re experiencing is the type that\u2019s eating at you, therapy (either formal or informal with your trusted people, whichever you\u2019re more comfortable with) will help and it\u2019s best to lance the boil sooner rather than later. \n\nIf it\u2019s the type that you have earned, do not let someone convince you that you need to be all sunshine and freaking lollipops about what he\u2019s put you through.", "NTA. \n\nYou're angry I get that. But if my dad told me he'd rather abort me aid be angry too. \n\nYou're NTA. It's the truth and it probably made him realise that your mom didn't lie. \n\nHe has no way to make it up to your mom so he's trying to make it up to you. I'd say it's a win not a loss. It means he listened to you and he's trying. \n\n we'll your mom clearly wanted you to have some familial support and was okay with you being nice to your dad so I think it's okay to try and repair that relationship more.\n\nHaving a family to rely on requires being able to have the hard conversations. You just had one. It sucks but how y'all recover from it is important. \n\nGet some therapy too. You don't deserve to carry that much anger around. It's a lot.", "Did you look him dead in the eye?", "NTA because after your mom dies and you were grieving was obviously a stupid at best time for your dad to bring this stuff up.\n\nI will say, not to defend him bringing it up, but rather because you may not now what really went on, that his version or somewhere in between may be the truth as much as you don\u2019t want to believe it and he may have been carrying it around a long time, confused and hurt by the impact it had on your relationship with him.", "Oh sweet summer child.  You'd surprised at how many women attempt to trap what you would call low value men. I've seen it attempted on guys that were complete losers.\n\n Can't say that it's what happened to your dad, but him being a driver and all that has little to no bearing on whether or not someone would attempt to trap him.", "NTA but forgive him or at the very least move on.

Quit hurting yourself.", "Two sides to every story, what made you assume your dad was lying?", "You do not continue to have a period when you are pregnant, your mother was lying.", "NTA\n\nYou told him the truth - why would a woman keep him around if he doesn't have much to offer, especially since he's not a very good person. More likely, it follows your mothers position on the story, where she wasn't aware she was pregnant until it was far too late to do much about it. She likely wouldn't have had a child with him if she had known about it much sooner, but she couldn't and still raised you with a lot of devotion.", "why is being a driver an insult ??", "NTA\n\nBut damn your dad, openly saying he didn't want you is low.\n\nHe deserves all the bile he can get", "The commenters here who keeps saying that anger has no purpose have clearly never had to tenderize an entire roast by hand.

Before enlightenment, chop wood. After enlightenment, chop wood.\n\n NTA. Your mother passed only a few short months ago, and the last thing that any grieving child needs to hear is their mother's boorish ex-husband crowing like a fool all over such a fresh pain.

Obviously keep yourself safe but you\u2019re freshly grieving your mother and he is not helping. He doesn\u2019t sound to ME like he\u2019s trying anything except to poison you against your mother and sell you his story of what happened between them.", "The only healthy way to get past the anger is to actually heal the wound, which likely will not happen until OP is safely away from the dude who keeps reopening the wound.", "That's exactly it. OP provided very few details, and the few they did provide are suggestive of a possibility of mum potentially trying to manipulate OP against dad.\n\nHard to tell without a ***lot*** more info.", "Not true. My mom had periods (tho probably more heaving spotting than an actual period) thru all 3 of her pregnancies. We were all born well before ultrasounds were a standard thing, so she never ended up with an actual due date because they had nothing to work off of... she just had to wait to go into labor. It's far from normal, but not impossible.", "It does happen. A friend of mine had her period for 5 months into pregnancy.", "Actually, you can.\n\nWhen my kid was born prem, I was sitting with him in SCU, and there was a mum there who just pooped out a baby she didn't know existed. Had her period the whole way through, didn't show, fully sex educated, no idea at all she was ever pregnant until a baby suddenly appeared.", "From what OP said, he said no such thing. What he said, was basically that he was baby trapped. Which is entirely possible, and usually a relationship killer. Whether that's what happened or not, it's clearly what he believes, and it's extremely believable. On the other hand, sonis mum not knowing she was preggers. When my kid was in SCU after being born prem, there was a mum there who had just pooped out a baby she didn't even know existed. She was rather surprised, to say the least. It does happen.\n\nIt's hard to tell without OP giving a hell of a lot more details instead of almost none, but from what OP *has* said it's entirely possible that mum was a bit manipulative. The whole speakerphone thing is a textbook manipulation tactic. But again, who knows, not enough details have been given to make a judgement on that side of things. \n\nEither way, even though it was motivated by grief, OPs response was a bit uncalled for, though I would hesitate to call them an asshole for it.", "I know right? I have literally told family members about how my mother bit my arm and they would be like \"she is your mom!\" So what? She can cut my arm off and I have to say Amen?", "I was a lot like you for decades.  An angry man who could hold a grudge forever.  Then in my 50\u2019s  I learned forgiveness isn\u2019t for those who wronged you:  Forgiveness is for yourself.  \n\nI\u2019m not talking about some kumbayah moment forgiveness, but just letting it go.  I couldn\u2019t give 2 figs for those I forgave and I\u2019ll never forget what they did.  Nor will they ever be in the position to harm me again.

You've got a lot you're dealing with right now and while this might have been a conversation to be had at some point, a few months out is going to be insanely too soon for most people and there will never be a time it's appropriate for some. You showed more restraint that you could have, so you kept the anger somewhat in check which is good. Having been there, knowing that blinding rage, I'm proud of you for keeping it in check. It's so easy to dive into it head first and take up residence. Be gentle with yourself, and others as much as possible. There's no good or right way to deal with grief or a grieving person. Something that took me way too long to realize, but that gives me great comfort now, is that I know my dad gave me enough love to last a lifetime in the short time I had him.
