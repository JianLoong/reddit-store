It sucks that your father is telling you all of this after she already passed, since she's not able to correct him. I understand where your anger is coming from, and that's why I don't think you were the ah.\n\nStill, think of your mom. You promised her you wouldn't hold it against him. If you keep all of this anger inside of you, it's only going to make you more miserable as life goes on. Think of your mom whenever you want to lash out again.", "NTA.  You had just lost your Mom and were grieving when your Dad insulted her memory, and you slammed him for it.  It was mean, but understandable.  It sounds like your Mom wants you to be at peace where your Dad is concerned, so don't cling to your anger about the past.  Try to figure out if you want any kind of relationship with your Dad based on what you can forgive and how you feel.  If you really feel that you don't want your Dad in your life, you will figure out other options than depending on him.", "NTA but I would tell you something that I have learned in my time on this planet. Anger is the poison we feed ourselves to punish others. You need to make peace with what and who your father is. He is half of you and he is not perfect in the least. It would seem that he loves you and that he is trying now. \n\nDo what you want and look out for you but the goal is to feel serene, at peace, and even love and gratitude no matter what", "I just want to say you\u2019re one of those ice cold and scary when angry types. I sort of salute you. \n\nTry to let go of your anger. It\u2019s like drinking poison.", "INFO. Some ages would be helpful... are you stuck living with your dad because you're underage or is everyone adults here? What was the situation with your dad when you were growing up? Was he around much? Has he always spoken this way of your mom or is this new? What was your parents relationship like? There's so much missing, but I realize there's a character limit.  \n\n\nFrom the info given, I'd lean toward NTA because he brought the conversation to that point. When you're dealing with people who recently lost a loved one, you need to read the room and he obviously didn't. Anyway it goes, I'm sorry for what you're going thru and hope you're able to find some peace with it all soon. It sucks to lose a parent at any age, but especially when you're young. It's really easy to grab onto the pain and anger because it seems better than letting yourself fall into the real grief and letting go of what feels like the little you have left of them. Please know there's beautiful memories on the other side of the anger and pain. It took me way too long to learn that, so I hope you do better than I did.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your loss. The best thing your dad ever did was to help make you. Take care of yourself.", "INFO. I can't tell if he was trying to hurt you intentionally as you sound like you were to him. It's hard to tell if you have reasons to hate him and refuse his seeming attempts to make it up to you, at least beyond him disrespecting your mother which could be reason enough I suppose. If he's been a parent who raised you, then whomever made her pregnant isn't that important honestly.", "ESH. It sounds like there are some questionable circumstances about what happened between your mom and your dad where nobody really knows what happened. Including you.", "I'm sorry for your loss. Losing a parent is never easy, and especially losing your sole parent. It's harder still when you're trying to work out who you are and how to be independent etc. I hope you're being kind to yourself.\n\nRegarding your conversation with your dad, you were harshly honest. You were grieving and your dad was insensitive. It's probably a wash there.\n\nIt sounds like he's been a terrible father but he's trying to be there for you now. It's a lot easier to establish yourself as an adult if you have access to well meaning family members with resources and a willingness to help you. You don't have to like your dad to accept his help, but it helps. You certainly should not accept his help while plotting his demise.\n\nLet the bad stuff go. You've got a long life ahead and it's easier to move forward with civility rather than rancour. ESH", "\"I might need him\"\n\nYTA. Possibly E S H. You alluded to bad things your Dad did but didn't tell us what, so I can't judge that. But this is a man you despise and look down on, but you don't want to ruin the connection to must because you might need to use him. That makes you TA", "YTA. I get that that's your mom, but people do that stuff all the time. It's not unreasonable for him to have thought that at the time. Definitely didn't deserve you insulting him like this. And they way you talk about wanting to keep the relationship going in case you can get something out of him? Really fucking gross", "I mean, your mom killed herself and your dad is beside himself.  It sounds like you heard a bunch of truth bombs you didn't like. \n\n\nHe shouldn't have said all that, but it seems like its from grief and confusion more than malice. You tore him apart when he told you his deepest darkest secret. I'm sure the relationship will be wierd for a while. I'm going neither of you is the asshole.
