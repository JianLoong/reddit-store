Playing dodgeball or any sport, running around at recess, anything active becomes so much easier to deal with when I had contacts. I also hated the feeling of glasses on my face so contacts were helpful with that. There are so many reasons to prefer contacts that have nothing to do with being shallow or superficial. The only questions you should have about this are what does your daughter want and is she responsible enough to be hygienic about wearing contacts.", "YTA\nYour kid wants them, but you want her to fit your idea of \"not superficial\". Which is pretty superficial in and on itself.", "YTA. It's not just superficial: it's comfort. Thick lenses can slip in normal use and are terrible for sports.", "YTA only because she wants them. I wear thick lenses and I\u2019ll tell you that contacts are helpful when it\u2019s raining, I\u2019m doing sports or physical activities in general (especially running), swimming, reading in bed, when I\u2019m out in the sun so I can wear regular sunglasses, etc. glasses can be inconvenient. But contacts also don\u2019t work for everyone. 10 is old enough to start making decisions about yourself and your body/appearance. Don\u2019t rob her of the chance to figure things out for herself.", "YTA, contacts are not just superficial, wearing glasses can be very bothersome for people when they engage in certain activities.", "This is most definitely not a superficial issue. It's not simply cosmetic. It's about the best choice for your child to have corrected vision.\n\nThick lenses for high diopter prescription means heavy, uncomfortable glasses that don't give your child her full range of visual field with clear focus. Glasses fog up, too.\n\nContact lenses for the same vision correction means much greater comfort and her full visual field. They don't fog up. \n\nSeriously, why wouldn't you want your child to have better vision with less discomfort?\n\nYTA. Why haven't you at least let your child try them and ask her what works best for her?", "Having contacts doesn't make you superficial.

Your concept of beauty is naturally different from the average 10-year-old's, and \"Well **I** think she's beautiful\" isn't going to keep any of her classmates from bullying her relentlessly.\n\nThis isn't about you and what you want.", "YTA\n\nAs someone who has very bad eyesight and wears thick glasses, I adore my contacts. It is not a superficial thing for me as contacts allow you to have so much more liberty and you're not worried about your glasses falling off or getting wet in the rain or an array of other problems that you may not consider if you have good eyesight. Also, glasses when they are very thick can distort how your face looks so it is not about being superficial it's about people seeing how you look truly and not a distorted version of you.\n\nI understand you trying to look out for her and you see her as your beautiful little girl, but depriving her of the confidence contacts will bring her is not the answer", "YTA. If the doctor said she was too young for them, that'd be different. And contact lenses do require responsibility - that would also be a good reason. But your reason? No way.", "YTA- you're not the one who has to go to school wearing really thick glasses. How would you feel if you had to wear them? Also, you're 40, and she's 10- at 40 you probably don't think it's a big deal, but would you feel the same at 10? I don't think it'll be easy for her to understand all the reasons why she shouldn't let it affect her if kids do start picking on her and teasing her.\n\nI think the only area you should \"intervene\" is telling her that you think she's beautiful no matter what, but you'll support her if she wants contact lenses.", "YTA.  Very much so. \n\nIt isn't just \"being superficial\". Being bullied in school is a legitimate, serious issue. Kids have done desperate things due to it. Plus, _it hurts your daughter._ If she goes to school with glasses, and gets made fun of, you know she's going to blame you, right? That's going to hurt _her._\n\nGet off your soapbox about \"being superficial.\" Care about your daughter's comfort and well-being; she's still in her formative years.

Wearing thick glasses is unpleasant. What is so wrong with both your daughter's eyesight, and her comfort, being improved at the same time? Superficial - pffffft.", "YTA contacts aren't superficial. Range of vision with glasses is limited and if they fall off she doesn't have vision. In fact if they recommend it get her laser eye surgery.", "If you'd said you didn't want her to wear contacts because you were worried she would be too young to use and maintain them properly and she might be getting eye problems, you'd have had a point (I wore them for about a year when I was 18 or so then gave up because my eyes were infected or irritated non-stop).\n\nBut YTA for not wanting her to get them *for that specific reason.* In a couple of years she'll be a teenager and having to wear thick glasses could be really hard on her self-confidence. Superficial? Maybe. But so is picking clothes or a hairstyle that look good on you, wearing makeup, etc. It shouldn't become an obsession but it's natural to want to look your best!", "YTA.   This is her journey to take in terms of how she feels about herself.  Instead of referring to her as superficial, just make sure she takes care of her eyes and don't worry about it too much. Mine grew up past this age, past teen years to adulthood and along the way were attempts at fitting in to a norm that they now find perplexing as adults.

A friend with a beautiful young teenage daughter often speaks of how viscous teenage girls are. Sadly, bullying is a reality in the world in which we live.  If contact lenses are the biggest issue you have with your daughter, consider yourself lucky.", "YTA.\n\nI was 12 when my parents allowed contacts (I also have a strong prescription) and it gave me so much confidence! It may be superficial but what is wrong with that? What is wrong with no wanting to be made fun of?\n\nAll four of my kids wear glasses (teens and adults now) and I gave all four the choice when they were around 11. Two chose glasses, one equally uses both and one uses contacts 99% of the time.\n\nLet her try contacts. She is a preteen and fitting in is important to most preteens. Let her make harmless choices like this.\n\nI want to add that there is nothing worse than fearing you will break your glasses during an activity or something and not be able to see.

I had a super high prescription so my glasses were thick and hideous and accordingly I thought I was too. As a result, I dressed awkwardly, my hair was always a mess, I had few friends in middle school, I had no confidence. I walked into school on the first day with my contacts and people stopped to stare. The most popular girl in my grade told me she was surprised at how beautiful my eyes were. By the end of the year, I\u2019d worked out my hair, my clothes, my confidence. Had a boyfriend. Had friends. Got invited to parties.

I actually wear the contacts that are 24/7 for a month. They only come out for about 10 minutes total when I change them for a new pair. And honestly, it\u2019s kind of a safety thing too.

This makes no sense. If you have problems with eye sight, both contacts and glasses are potential solutions. If anything, it would be more superficial to pick glasses that you think are stylish, because it\u2019s adding something to your face that isn\u2019t naturally there. But even that isn\u2019t \u201csuperficial.\u201d So if she had the option of thin lenses and picked cute frames because she liked the way they looked, you wouldn\u2019t think that\u2019s superficial?!", "Contacts are expensive\u2014and you really do need a fall-back pair of glasses anyway.

And even if it were, why is it so bad to try to look your best? Aren't we all trying to? Your bar is way too high, lower it to more reasonable standards.

I love contacts.  Please let her try them. Some people can't wear them.", "YTA", "Trust your daughter's judgment and respect her needs.  Her self esteem should be the major consideration here.  If this is something she wants in order to feel more comfortable at school, then do it.  It's great to learn to blaze your own trail and be your own person but forcing her to wear thick glasses when she has another option is kinda cruel really.  If she is willing to stick a lense in her eye to avoid glasses then she really want it.", "YTA if her eye doctor thinks she's mature enough to handle contact lenses.\n\nI wore thick coke bottle glasses from the time I was two until the minimum age my eye doctor would approve of contacts at age thirteen. That was also 1978, there weren't the lighter, thinner, daily wear contacts available then, so my first pair cost about $200, which was a MAJOR expense then. \n\nI counted down the days for years waiting for those precious contacts.

It was torture. \n\nIf you can help her feel more normal before she enters middle school, you'll be doing her a huge favor.", "Super nearsighted since a kid. I always got the most thinned glasses there was on the market - and those cost a fortune. I still to this day get severe headaches if I wear my glasses for too long because of the weight and pressure it puts on my ears, my nose, etc. Yes, contacts can be more aesthetic in some cases. But it's really about comfort. \n\nNot to mention, depending on her vision, some contacts now can actually slower the evolution of nearsightedness in kids. Maybe it does not apply to her, but I would investigate with her eye doctor and optician to see if this could work for her.", "YTA. If contacts are what your daughter wants she should be able to get them (assuming finances aren\u2019t an issue). I switched from contacts to glasses for comfort and convenience.", "Contact/glasses wearer here. Get her the contacts.

I have terrible vision and 100% it\u2019s better with contacts as opposed to my glasses. The lenses are really thick, it\u2019s hard to drive at night/in the rain, over the years some of the frames I\u2019ve had will slowly bend outward over time (bc of my lens thickness) requiring me to go to the eyeglass place and have them heated/bent/fitted every 3 months. I can wear sunglasses in the summer, I can read in my bed at night while lying on my side\u2026 tons of things I guarantee YOU haven\u2019t thought of.

Let her have the contacts.", "YTA if she wants them and you won\u2019t let her have them.", "Something that could contributes to her health and wellbeing is not superficial by any means. First off, contacts can help her engage in more physical activities that might be difficult to do with glasses on.  They make sports glasses but they can often be clunky and difficult to see out of.  Contacts also don't have as much image distortion or glare that you get with glass lenses, and may provide her with a much clearer and wider range of view. For some people contacts are also more comfortable.  I started wearing them in the 4th grade because wearing my glasses caused me horrible migraines.  And her eye doctor makes a good point, kids can be cruel.  She should not have to change her appearance, but glasses vs. contacts is not just a case of looks but also necessity.\n\nNow these things may not apply to your daughter, but if there is a chance you could benefit her in some way wouldn't you take it? Getting contacts over glasses is a small thing comparatively, and might be really good for her later on.  If you are unsure then start with some sample pairs.  See how she likes them and get her used to wearing them early on.  Maybe you save them for special occasions or certain activities, but for whatever reason you'll have them available to you if she needs them.\n\nBy just outright saying no YTA.

It\u2019s not just a cosmetic thing, if her prescription is high enough to require thick lenses, she probably has very little peripheral vision with the glasses.

Please consider getting her contacts and spend the money to buy her the monthly ones instead of the permanent ones, if she loses one or they get damaged she will have a handy replacement.", "YTA totally TA.  Get her contacts ASAP.  Apart from anything gas permeable lenses may actually prevent her sight getting any worse!  If the eye doctor has told you to get them then get them ffs.

Your argument is flawed. \n\nWanting to look the same as your peers is not superficial, everyone wants to fit in, even you. You could deny it, but it's human nature to feel that way.\n\nContact lenses will make her look more like herself than glasses will.", "YTA. Glasses are annoying. Contacts sit closer to the eye and work better than glasses for correcting vision. Contacts also help reduce eyestrain for the same reason. If you think she is capable of taking them out every night, cleaning them (super simple), and popping them back in, then there really is no reason not to let her other than being an AH. It will improve her eye health and mental health.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m sure your daughter\u2019s doctor also mentioned the weight of the glasses and how awkward that can be.

My current eye doctor and my previous eye doctor both recommended I not use my glasses unless I truly have to because of the headaches.

Even if you\u2019re against it for \u201csuperficial\u201d reasons, think of the benefits as long as she understands how to take care of them and avoid infections by keeping her hands clean and changing the solution regularly.

Glasses fog up during weather changes, or even taking a drink of hot cocoa. Ever take a basketball to the face during PE while wearing glasses? I have, and the bruising and broken frames were awful. How about trying to wear safety goggles over glasses in science classes? They don't sit right, or don't provide the protective seal necessary to guard her sight. Heck, even sunglasses and swim goggles (to further protect her eyes) are going to have to be prescription, or else she's going to be working blind in pools and sunny conditions.

When I got contacts, I could look out of the corner of my eyes for the first time. I can get regular swim goggles and sunglasses. Safety equipment fits. The contacts hold my eyeball shape better and my astigmatism slowed. I can actually see myself in a steam-filled bathroom when I want to shave (and don't have to do it by feel). And while I like the way I look without my glasses, it is not even in my top ten reasons why I would choose contacts again in a heartbeat.\n\n\nI understand you want to teach your daughter about not caving to peer pressure, but this is not the right scenario to do it. Teach her that resisting peer pressure means not sacrificing her values (honesty, kindness, generosity, etc.).

If Im working or running errands, I typically stick to glasses. \n\nI think letting her have both and be able to choose, will show how much you respect her.

I switch between both now, depending on the day and what I need to do (for example, if I'm driving somewhere, contacts are better because I can see out of the corners of my eyes), but I definitely hit my head on cupboard doors and such a lot more in glasses because of the lack of peripheral vision.

I didn't have to worry about rain, or fogging up in muggy weather, or being smashed to bits because I got hit in the face with a volleyball or other projectile (yes, it happened, more than once). I was also in marching band, and having the contacts on was so much easier when wearing our hat, or having the glasses slip down a sweaty nose in the middle of a show, when we couldn't move at all.\n\nNow, eventually, I grew out of contacts. Glasses are like a security blanket for me, and I have that weird phantom glasses feeling even when I'm not wearing them. Then contacts were too much of a hassle for me in the morning, and I just reverted back to glasses in my later 20s.

I have always used the bi-weekly ones and was good about taking them out at night, cleaning, changing them out etc but if she is not ready for that responsibility then get her daily disposable ones.

Kids will take ANYTHING & use it as a target for trasing or bullying. Why woukd you want to expose your daughter to this??? I begged for contacts and finally got them in 7th grade. A year overlap with brace from 6th to 7th. I do not look back on that time fondly. Adults have a different perspective. If your daughter wants contacts & is responsible enough to care for them, GET HER THE CONTACTS.", "YTA. My wife wears contacts, but just used glasses for years. I never really thought about it, but glasses fall, fog, and can distort your vision. It\u2019s not strictly superficial.", " \nYTA. Kid wants them. Doctor recommends them. You don\u2019t want them cause kid might be \u201csuperficial\u201d. Trust ya raised your kid with the values you want to instill, enough that wearing contacts won\u2019t somehow erase that.", "YTA. I have worn contacts since age 16. Glasses are cumbersome. Contacts give me the freedom to live an active lifestyle. I don\u2019t have to worry about my glasses breaking or falling off.", "YTA. They\u2019re her eyes and her face. She gets to make this decision. Your job is to support her decision so she starts feeling confident in making other decisions for herself. Keep your judgements to yourself on this one because they\u2019re contacts not a boob job.", "YTA\n\nI am severely nearsighted, my glasses are very thick. I literally see better with contacts and they are considered medically necessary for this reason.\n\nI wish wish wish my mom had listened when multiple eye doctors told her I would do better with contacts but she refused until my high school graduation. She later admitted she regretted making me wait.\n\nDon't make the mistake my mom did. Ask the eye doctor if your daughter will see better with them. She'll get to have peripheral vision as an added bonus. I bet she has limited now.\n\nThis isn't about vanity. It's about seeing better.", "YTA\n\nFor starters, contacts are way closer to her normal appearance than glasses. Furthermore, as someone whose parents said the same thing until I was 18 and could get them on my own, I actually find contacts much easier than glasses. Most of the time I forget they are in. As long as she learns how to take care of them properly, they are super easy and unobtrusive", "ESH.\n\nThe doctor should not have suggested contacts for a *she might get bullied\" reason.\n\nYou should not refuse contacts to prove a point.\n\nThere are things to consider :\n\n1. Does your daughter want to try contacts? \n\n2. Can you afford both glasses and contacts?\n\n3. Is she mature enough to handle the issues related to wearing contacts?  Examples are inserting them, changing them in a timely manner, hand washing.\n\n4. Can she do a trial period with free samples to see if she can tolerate them?\n\n5. Will contacts help, harm or have no effect on her long term eye health /vision?", "You suck , my mom got me contacts when I was 12 because I am nearsighted and I actually got them in color at that time, she didn't care.", "YTA. Thick glasses are heavy (had thick ones all my life) so if the eye doctor recommended them and your daughter wants them you should give her a trial with them.", "It doesn\u2019t matter how you feel, it matters how she feels. If she wants the contacts to feel beautiful, let her have the contacts. YTA", "I was extremely nearsighted as a child and wore coke bottle thick glasses.  When I was 14, I got soft contact lenses.  It changed my life because for the first time, I actually had peripheral vision.

It\u2019s not just about vanity.  You are TA.", "I have pretty bad vision and I have fairly thick glasses. I love my glasses! Especially with high-index lenses and the right frames, I think they\u2019re fun and I like wearing them. \n\nI still own and wear contacts sometimes! They\u2019re very convenient to have on hand for when I\u2019m doing something active, or when it\u2019s very hot/very cold (to avoid sweater/foggy glasses). It\u2019s totally fine to encourage your daughter to wear her glasses and to take pride in them, especially if you can\u2019t afford to buy 365 days worth of contacts every year, but you should give her the option of wearing contacts at least some of the time when it\u2019s more convenient. \n\nYTA.", "NTA! I also have a very thick prescription. 10 yr olds should not be wearing contacts. That\u2019s a big responsibility and she needs to learn to accept herself for who she is. Contacts aren\u2019t the end all be all. \n\nI will say, my glasses are a topic of discussion often but that\u2019s who I am. I\u2019m not ashamed of it.

To have a view without limitations, rain is no problem, mask or opening the oven. Not cleaning the glasses the x-th time a day. Not having the pain when you lay on the earpiece or general not having the feeling on the ear and nose. It is so great. Also at sports or playing the give so much more freedom and opportunities. \n\nI also ask myself, if you OP wear thick glasses like your daughter and if so, have you ever even tried contacts? \n\nYTA", "Really, the kid should be getting both so there's an alternative if she can't use the contacts. \n\nPlus, as someone who's worn glasses since I was a preteen, I've gotten used to how my face looks with glasses and hate how it looks without them. The daughter could very easily want to wear glasses in time. OP is just as bad as the supposed bullies she's worried about by trying to dictate her daughter's medical aid.", "YTA. I got contacts at 17, which helped my self esteem.

My parents thought it too expensive so no sunglasses for me when I wore glasses. Really sucked in the summer :( \n\nThere was even a time when I refused to wear my glasses during recess, and not just for the bullying but because I was afraid I might break them and I needed them for class. I barely moved during recess because of that.", "It's not really recommended to wear contacts while swimming due to increased infection risk.\n\nThough I won't pretend I don't routinely wear mine in hot tubs, showers etc... But that's part of why I chose daily disposable lenses.", "Oh boy, I have astigmatism and my current perscription for contacts (glasses are slightly higher naturally) is -6,5 for my left and -5,5 for my right plus 1,25 on both eyes for the astigmatism. \n\nI am blind as fuck without my contacts or glasses. And it sucks that I don't have the money for an extra pair of glasses because right now I can't get my hands on a refill for my contacts (been looking for three months now) and my current glasses give me headaches when I wear them too long.", "THIS! When I still only wore glasses, I once had to have them changed three times in one year. It was nuts. Now since I've been wearing contacts (past 12 years) I only had my perscription changed once slightly (different axis for my astigmatism).", "To me who has to wear thick glasses I can't imagine a little kid having to wear the same prescription as me because of how heavy they are.  It's fine for me but kids would not be able to handle it.", "This is what they invented daily-wear contacts for. I would absolutely not give a kid monthly or even weekly contacts. I\u2019m 35 and I can\u2019t be trusted not to give myself an eye infection with longer-term lenses.", "Not even just that. Does she buy clothes that she likes, and that she thinks suit her in some way? I know I do. How superficial of me.", "I would point out that all of those are \"not at ten years old you don't\". I'm not sure I'd trust a kid that young with contacts, not understanding that your fingers need to be *sterile* is a good way to get an eye infection. I *would* let the kid get whatever frames she wants and shell out for the high-index plastic to thin them out as much as possible, though.", "I have truly terrible vision, and glasses can be awful. The blurred edges really start getting to me, never mind the difficulties when it\u2019s raining, when it\u2019s cold, when it\u2019s sunny, when you want to do any sort of physical activity.", "I\u2019m legally blind in one eye (thanks to coloboma) and I HATE glasses with a burning passion. Having a super thick lens makes me motion sick (yeah you get used to it but no). I got contacts in middle school and it made everything so much easier. I don\u2019t mind how I look in glasses, heck if anything I put them on for selfies more than I actually wear them. It\u2019s 100% up to the daughter.

The single greatest thing I\u2019ve ever done to improve my quality of life was LASIK.", "I am almost 6 feet tall, and get asked all the time why I didn't play basketball when young. Well, I have no depth perception and no peripheral vision, so sports balls flying at my head was not on my list of things I enjoyed. And back in the olden times, contacts were made of a type of plastic that I was allergic to, so no contacts (yes, I'm old!)

Getting contacts at 11 changed my life\u2014not only did I no longer get made fun of for my super thick coke bottle glasses, but I was way more comfortable and could actually see better.

I\u2019ve had glasses since kindergarten, almost twenty years now with vision as bad as OP says her kids is, and in the third grade I definitely lost mine. My eyes were getting so bad when I was little that the doctor told my mom that if my eyesight didn\u2019t level or improve I\u2019d get bifocals the next time he saw me. I still lost them when I was a child. I need them to even walk without tripping over something I can see, and I still managed to misplace them at like eight years old. Couldn\u2019t find them. They were gone, parents had no choice but to get another pair. I never did lose them again, mind you, and my parents helped me get to the root of how I lost them so it didn\u2019t happen again.
