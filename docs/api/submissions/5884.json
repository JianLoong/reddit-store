Playing dodgeball or any sport, running around at recess, anything active becomes so much easier to deal with when I had contacts. I also hated the feeling of glasses on my face so contacts were helpful with that. There are so many reasons to prefer contacts that have nothing to do with being shallow or superficial. The only questions you should have about this are what does your daughter want and is she responsible enough to be hygienic about wearing contacts.", "YTA\nYour kid wants them, but you want her to fit your idea of \"not superficial\". Which is pretty superficial in and on itself.", "YTA. It's not just superficial: it's comfort. Thick lenses can slip in normal use and are terrible for sports.", "YTA only because she wants them. I wear thick lenses and I\u2019ll tell you that contacts are helpful when it\u2019s raining, I\u2019m doing sports or physical activities in general (especially running), swimming, reading in bed, when I\u2019m out in the sun so I can wear regular sunglasses, etc. glasses can be inconvenient. But contacts also don\u2019t work for everyone. 10 is old enough to start making decisions about yourself and your body/appearance. Don\u2019t rob her of the chance to figure things out for herself.", "YTA, contacts are not just superficial, wearing glasses can be very bothersome for people when they engage in certain activities.", "This is most definitely not a superficial issue. It's not simply cosmetic. It's about the best choice for your child to have corrected vision.\n\nThick lenses for high diopter prescription means heavy, uncomfortable glasses that don't give your child her full range of visual field with clear focus. Glasses fog up, too.\n\nContact lenses for the same vision correction means much greater comfort and her full visual field. They don't fog up. \n\nSeriously, why wouldn't you want your child to have better vision with less discomfort?\n\nYTA. Why haven't you at least let your child try them and ask her what works best for her?", "Having contacts doesn't make you superficial.

Your concept of beauty is naturally different from the average 10-year-old's, and \"Well **I** think she's beautiful\" isn't going to keep any of her classmates from bullying her relentlessly.\n\nThis isn't about you and what you want.", "YTA\n\nAs someone who has very bad eyesight and wears thick glasses, I adore my contacts. It is not a superficial thing for me as contacts allow you to have so much more liberty and you're not worried about your glasses falling off or getting wet in the rain or an array of other problems that you may not consider if you have good eyesight. Also, glasses when they are very thick can distort how your face looks so it is not about being superficial it's about people seeing how you look truly and not a distorted version of you.\n\nI understand you trying to look out for her and you see her as your beautiful little girl, but depriving her of the confidence contacts will bring her is not the answer", "YTA. If the doctor said she was too young for them, that'd be different. And contact lenses do require responsibility - that would also be a good reason. But your reason? No way.", "YTA- you're not the one who has to go to school wearing really thick glasses. How would you feel if you had to wear them? Also, you're 40, and she's 10- at 40 you probably don't think it's a big deal, but would you feel the same at 10? I don't think it'll be easy for her to understand all the reasons why she shouldn't let it affect her if kids do start picking on her and teasing her.\n\nI think the only area you should \"intervene\" is telling her that you think she's beautiful no matter what, but you'll support her if she wants contact lenses.", "YTA.  Very much so. \n\nIt isn't just \"being superficial\". Being bullied in school is a legitimate, serious issue. Kids have done desperate things due to it. Plus, _it hurts your daughter._ If she goes to school with glasses, and gets made fun of, you know she's going to blame you, right? That's going to hurt _her._\n\nGet off your soapbox about \"being superficial.\" Care about your daughter's comfort and well-being; she's still in her formative years.

Wearing thick glasses is unpleasant. What is so wrong with both your daughter's eyesight, and her comfort, being improved at the same time? Superficial - pffffft.", "YTA contacts aren't superficial. Range of vision with glasses is limited and if they fall off she doesn't have vision. In fact if they recommend it get her laser eye surgery.", "If you'd said you didn't want her to wear contacts because you were worried she would be too young to use and maintain them properly and she might be getting eye problems, you'd have had a point (I wore them for about a year when I was 18 or so then gave up because my eyes were infected or irritated non-stop).\n\nBut YTA for not wanting her to get them *for that specific reason.* In a couple of years she'll be a teenager and having to wear thick glasses could be really hard on her self-confidence. Superficial? Maybe. But so is picking clothes or a hairstyle that look good on you, wearing makeup, etc. It shouldn't become an obsession but it's natural to want to look your best!", "YTA.   This is her journey to take in terms of how she feels about herself.  Instead of referring to her as superficial, just make sure she takes care of her eyes and don't worry about it too much. Mine grew up past this age, past teen years to adulthood and along the way were attempts at fitting in to a norm that they now find perplexing as adults.

A friend with a beautiful young teenage daughter often speaks of how viscous teenage girls are. Sadly, bullying is a reality in the world in which we live.  If contact lenses are the biggest issue you have with your daughter, consider yourself lucky.", "YTA.\n\nI was 12 when my parents allowed contacts (I also have a strong prescription) and it gave me so much confidence! It may be superficial but what is wrong with that? What is wrong with no wanting to be made fun of?\n\nAll four of my kids wear glasses (teens and adults now) and I gave all four the choice when they were around 11. Two chose glasses, one equally uses both and one uses contacts 99% of the time.\n\nLet her try contacts. She is a preteen and fitting in is important to most preteens. Let her make harmless choices like this.\n\nI want to add that there is nothing worse than fearing you will break your glasses during an activity or something and not be able to see.

I had a super high prescription so my glasses were thick and hideous and accordingly I thought I was too. As a result, I dressed awkwardly, my hair was always a mess, I had few friends in middle school, I had no confidence. I walked into school on the first day with my contacts and people stopped to stare. The most popular girl in my grade told me she was surprised at how beautiful my eyes were. By the end of the year, I\u2019d worked out my hair, my clothes, my confidence. Had a boyfriend. Had friends. Got invited to parties.

I actually wear the contacts that are 24/7 for a month. They only come out for about 10 minutes total when I change them for a new pair. And honestly, it\u2019s kind of a safety thing too.

This makes no sense. If you have problems with eye sight, both contacts and glasses are potential solutions. If anything, it would be more superficial to pick glasses that you think are stylish, because it\u2019s adding something to your face that isn\u2019t naturally there. But even that isn\u2019t \u201csuperficial.\u201d So if she had the option of thin lenses and picked cute frames because she liked the way they looked, you wouldn\u2019t think that\u2019s superficial?!", "Contacts are expensive\u2014and you really do need a fall-back pair of glasses anyway.

And even if it were, why is it so bad to try to look your best? Aren't we all trying to? Your bar is way too high, lower it to more reasonable standards.

I love contacts.  Please let her try them. Some people can't wear them.", "YTA", "Trust your daughter's judgment and respect her needs.  Her self esteem should be the major consideration here.  If this is something she wants in order to feel more comfortable at school, then do it.  It's great to learn to blaze your own trail and be your own person but forcing her to wear thick glasses when she has another option is kinda cruel really.  If she is willing to stick a lense in her eye to avoid glasses then she really want it.", "YTA if her eye doctor thinks she's mature enough to handle contact lenses.\n\nI wore thick coke bottle glasses from the time I was two until the minimum age my eye doctor would approve of contacts at age thirteen. That was also 1978, there weren't the lighter, thinner, daily wear contacts available then, so my first pair cost about $200, which was a MAJOR expense then. \n\nI counted down the days for years waiting for those precious contacts.

It was torture. \n\nIf you can help her feel more normal before she enters middle school, you'll be doing her a huge favor.", "Super nearsighted since a kid. I always got the most thinned glasses there was on the market - and those cost a fortune. I still to this day get severe headaches if I wear my glasses for too long because of the weight and pressure it puts on my ears, my nose, etc. Yes, contacts can be more aesthetic in some cases. But it's really about comfort. \n\nNot to mention, depending on her vision, some contacts now can actually slower the evolution of nearsightedness in kids. Maybe it does not apply to her, but I would investigate with her eye doctor and optician to see if this could work for her.", "YTA. If contacts are what your daughter wants she should be able to get them (assuming finances aren\u2019t an issue). I switched from contacts to glasses for comfort and convenience.", "Contact/glasses wearer here. Get her the contacts.

I have terrible vision and 100% it\u2019s better with contacts as opposed to my glasses. The lenses are really thick, it\u2019s hard to drive at night/in the rain, over the years some of the frames I\u2019ve had will slowly bend outward over time (bc of my lens thickness) requiring me to go to the eyeglass place and have them heated/bent/fitted every 3 months. I can wear sunglasses in the summer, I can read in my bed at night while lying on my side\u2026 tons of things I guarantee YOU haven\u2019t thought of.

Let her have the contacts.", "YTA if she wants them and you won\u2019t let her have them.", "Something that could contributes to her health and wellbeing is not superficial by any means. First off, contacts can help her engage in more physical activities that might be difficult to do with glasses on.  They make sports glasses but they can often be clunky and difficult to see out of.  Contacts also don't have as much image distortion or glare that you get with glass lenses, and may provide her with a much clearer and wider range of view. For some people contacts are also more comfortable.  I started wearing them in the 4th grade because wearing my glasses caused me horrible migraines.  And her eye doctor makes a good point, kids can be cruel.  She should not have to change her appearance, but glasses vs. contacts is not just a case of looks but also necessity.\n\nNow these things may not apply to your daughter, but if there is a chance you could benefit her in some way wouldn't you take it? Getting contacts over glasses is a small thing comparatively, and might be really good for her later on.  If you are unsure then start with some sample pairs.  See how she likes them and get her used to wearing them early on.  Maybe you save them for special occasions or certain activities, but for whatever reason you'll have them available to you if she needs them.\n\nBy just outright saying no YTA.

It\u2019s not just a cosmetic thing, if her prescription is high enough to require thick lenses, she probably has very little peripheral vision with the glasses.

Please consider getting her contacts and spend the money to buy her the monthly ones instead of the permanent ones, if she loses one or they get damaged she will have a handy replacement.", "YTA totally TA.  Get her contacts ASAP.  Apart from anything gas permeable lenses may actually prevent her sight getting any worse!  If the eye doctor has told you to get them then get them ffs.

Your argument is flawed. \n\nWanting to look the same as your peers is not superficial, everyone wants to fit in, even you. You could deny it, but it's human nature to feel that way.\n\nContact lenses will make her look more like herself than glasses will.", "YTA. Glasses are annoying. Contacts sit closer to the eye and work better than glasses for correcting vision. Contacts also help reduce eyestrain for the same reason. If you think she is capable of taking them out every night, cleaning them (super simple), and popping them back in, then there really is no reason not to let her other than being an AH. It will improve her eye health and mental health.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m sure your daughter\u2019s doctor also mentioned the weight of the glasses and how awkward that can be.

My current eye doctor and my previous eye doctor both recommended I not use my glasses unless I truly have to because of the headaches.

Even if you\u2019re against it for \u201csuperficial\u201d reasons, think of the benefits as long as she understands how to take care of them and avoid infections by keeping her hands clean and changing the solution regularly.

Glasses fog up during weather changes, or even taking a drink of hot cocoa. Ever take a basketball to the face during PE while wearing glasses? I have, and the bruising and broken frames were awful. How about trying to wear safety goggles over glasses in science classes? They don't sit right, or don't provide the protective seal necessary to guard her sight. Heck, even sunglasses and swim goggles (to further protect her eyes) are going to have to be prescription, or else she's going to be working blind in pools and sunny conditions.

When I got contacts, I could look out of the corner of my eyes for the first time. I can get regular swim goggles and sunglasses. Safety equipment fits. The contacts hold my eyeball shape better and my astigmatism slowed. I can actually see myself in a steam-filled bathroom when I want to shave (and don't have to do it by feel). And while I like the way I look without my glasses, it is not even in my top ten reasons why I would choose contacts again in a heartbeat.\n\n\nI understand you want to teach your daughter about not caving to peer pressure, but this is not the right scenario to do it. Teach her that resisting peer pressure means not sacrificing her values (honesty, kindness, generosity, etc.).

I had a constant headache because of my glasses that went away when I switched to contacts, and I didn't realize it wasn't normal until I stopped having those headaches.", "That's such a really cool reaction. Thanks for listening, it was obvious from the start that you really want the best for your daughter. She will be super happy about getting them!", "Great. Make sure she keeps up with proper care.  Contact hygiene is extremely important.", "As a suggestion: make sure she gets solid guidance from the eye doctor or an eye care professional about proper care and cleaning of her contacts and help her develop good habits.  At 10, there will be some maturity issues about maintaining a good routine.  Perhaps daily disposables could be worth looking into (if she doesn't have astigmatism; torics are pricier still).", "Probably a good move. I think people here were a little harsh with you as 10 is quite young to wear contacts. But as long as she has the motivation and is responsible enough to take care of them then it seems like the way to go! I'm sure she'll be very grateful (Also as an eye doctor myself- I'm surprised you were pressurised at the appointment because age 10 is the youngest I would usually recommend contacts and very much on a case by case basis)", "Also - if her glasses are thick - look into getting thinner lenses (and impact resistant).  Technology has come a long way and many chain stores do not carry the better lenses (greater than a 1.7 hi index).  Thinner lenses are not only about looks - there is less distortion in the vision and the glasses will weigh less (ie will be more comfortable to wear).  If it\u2019s not available near you - it is fairly easy to order online.", "So cool of you to choose your daughters side! My mother never listened to me when I was your kids age, and it still kinda hurts.", "I predominantly wore contacts when I was in high school and college (they particularly helped with sports and the heat) but I do wear glasses more as an adult, but glasses can be annoying, but so can contacts. Both have their pluses and minuses so it\u2019s really become a day by day choice. Say, Im going to a bar or concert and it\u2019s crowded, well glasses tend to fog in those situations. If Im working or running errands, I typically stick to glasses. \n\nI think letting her have both and be able to choose, will show how much you respect her. I know it might seem superficial and it might be, although different glasses styles have become popular, it is also a functionality bit too.\n\nJust make sure she is taking good care of her contacts. Very important to clean them properly.", "There\u2019s nothing like the feeling you get when you\u2019re being active and your glasses fall off, especially when they also break", "Yes, this was me. I lost friends because I couldn\u2019t see 5 feet in front of me and didn\u2019t recognize people. I also had terrible school work because I couldn\u2019t see the board. YTA OP. You\u2019re holding her back and judging her feelings. This will change the course of her schooling, her mental health, and her relationship with you.", "Disposable contacts have eliminated a lot of that. The kind I wear is pop em in for a month and forget about. No cleaning, no daily in and out.", "I agree that it can be very difficult to use contacts. I was ten as well when I started getting them, mostly for superficial reasons. \n\nHowever, if it isn\u2019t a financial strain I think that she should at least allow her to daughter to try. You go to these lessons were they teach you how to put them in. It took me two or three lessons. It\u2019s unfair to say that she can\u2019t try at all because \u201cI think she\u2019s pretty\u201d. \n\nI wore contacts predominantly for 4 years after getting them. It was only recently that I found and pair of glasses that I liked on me. It\u2019s her daughters journey. At the age she\u2019s at, she shouldn\u2019t be forced to feel bad about something like glasses.\n\nTLDR: I would let her try once or twice. If it doesn\u2019t work out, she deals with it. If she puts in the effort and shows responsibility let her get them. She is the one who has to deal with wearing them.", "And it\u2019s not just that the lenses are thick. They also distort the look of the eyes. So my daughter looks like she has one big eye.", "What are you even talking about.\n\nThe doctor is not worried about the kids looks but about the fact that she might get bullied. \n\nThat's what good doctors do, they care about their patients.", "The doctor ain\u2019t worried about her looks, OP is worried about her looks.", "Exactly; 10 year old me begged my mom for contacts and I left them in. They turned yellow and almost stuck to my eyeballs. People on here seem to only be concerned with the child's desires, not the responsibility it comes with", "This is me!! I got contacts as a teenager and they were life changing! Don't get me wrong I wear my glasses a lot too especially at home, heck I've been down with the flu and can't stand the thought of putting in my contacts, but I have the option and I LOVE that", "My wife says she has no depth perception in glasses. She straight up ran into a wall one time while wearing them", "Yeah, like the daughter is a project, not a person", "Contacts are also awesome if you have to cut onions. No tears unlike with bare eyes or glasses!", "Have good news for you \u2014 you can get bifocal, even trifocals contacts as your eyes get older, and they are awesome.", "Same here. I actually get so many compliments when I wear my glasses, but  find contacts more comfortable.", "I\u2019ve worn contacts since soft lenses became a thing.  I was about 14 or so and my vision was so bad, that every six months I needed a new prescription.  It was amazing as I no longer had issues with depth perception and I had peripheral vision for the first time in years.  If the OPs only concern is she thinks it\u2019s vain, and not that her daughter isn\u2019t mature enough, then she\u2019s TA.", "In general, I think it pretty quickly becomes a norm as you get older but in elementary school I didn't know many kids with glasses at all. They did stick out a little and kids can be mean for no reason, but the main thing is really them being thick. It makes a huge difference in how they look, if an eye dr is mentioning it I would trust them on it", "Good points - I was thinking 10 is a bit young in terms of maintaining and cleaning them properly.  Might disposables be a better direction?", "Lenses can be made smaller. I am so confused as to why they are so worried about her having thick lenses when they can pay to have them thinned. Not everyone likes lenses. She is 10 she might not like the in and out of them.", "I agree - I have a very responsible 11 year old granddaughter and I\u2019m not sure she would be ready for contacts.", "Lenses can only be made smaller by a certain degree and not by much depending on the diopters.\n\nMy wife has a pretty thick one as well and already got the thinnest version possible.", "Yeah so do i and they are half the size they would be if not thinned. They arent milk bottle bottom size anymore. Unless its different in other countrys. You get frames that fit the lense well and then thin completly.", "My left eye is so bad that that lens is significantly thicker than my right lens. It doesn't fit into any standard pair of glasses and it's obvious. They made it as thin as possible but were limited in what could be done due to my prescription. It really depends how bad her eyes are", "Mine are 6 and 7 and always look the same in frames. But i think it most be different what they will do in different places."]}
