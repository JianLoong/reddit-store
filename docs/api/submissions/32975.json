It\u2019s common to have hairdressing schools where a student does your hair and an experienced person observes/corrects but I still don\u2019t think you\u2019d want her cutting, so maybe she\u2019d be happy with that as an olive branch.", "She needs to respect your no.

Fraser Bell, PhD, Science Insights Leader for hair care brand Nexxus, says that the company\u2019s own studies had shown that the structure of hair on the inside and outside of curls was different. However, Dr. Bell and colleagues wanted to determine whether the protein composition of different hair types was the same. \u201cWe wanted to understand if this was really the case, and proteomic studies, using advanced mass spectrometry methods, were the only way to know for sure,\u201d Dr. Bell says. \u201cIt was using our proteomic methods that identified the subtle but important differences in the protein composition of curly hair and straight hair.\u201d \n\nFindings published in a white paper in Journal of Cosmetic Science demonstrate that there are differences in the protein composition of curly and straight hair types. The shape characteristics of curly fibers, and how they interact and align with each other, can make this hair type feel inherently rougher and more dry than straighter hair, even when in a healthy condition, influencing the hair care needs and habits of individuals.\"\n\nWritten in 2021.
