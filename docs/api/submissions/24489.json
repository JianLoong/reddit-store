Mary did the right thing by taking her away becuase she was crying during gift opening (and it sounds like maybe there is an issue there), but giving Willa something small after Serena got something would have been nice. Or giving it to Serena in private could have been better. It could have also been a good moment to teach your daughter that if she\u2019s giving away one thing others might feel excluded so maybe she could choose something small for Willa or give Serena her car in private as to not hurt others feelings\u2026.

SIX.\nWilla has gone from shared custody to sole custody, which suggests either she's suffering the emotional trauma of feeling abandoned by her bio father, or life there was lousy enough she's relieved to be away which creates it's own kind of trauma.\n(Willa's mom is quite probably feeling guilty about all that too.)\nHer mom is engaged to a guy with a daughter, so Willa is coping with uncertainty over this new family dynamic.\nNow today she watched her new \"cousin\" open a brand new car for her birthday, then her \"stepsister\" got a new-to-her car for no reason at all, and Willa herself gets... absolutely nothing.\n(And Willa's mom is probably wondering whether this was a one-time awkwardness or whether this is merely the first in a long line of snubs because Willa isn't *really* your brother's daughter.)\n\nSo IMO Willa having Big Feelings is totally reasonable and does NOT automatically mean she is spoiled. OP your only mistake was that Adelia needed to either give the car to BOTH of them or wait to give Serena the car later, instead of rubbing in Willa's outsider status by doing it in front of her.
