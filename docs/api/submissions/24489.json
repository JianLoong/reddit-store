You\u2019re teaching your child to be generous while Mary is teaching her child to be demanding and entitled. People use the excuse that it\u2019s a child, but I say childhood is where lessons should be learned. Maybe it\u2019s better that Mary doesn\u2019t bring her around anymore. Mary herself needs to learn lessons on how to handle her child. Good luck at future family gatherings.", "ESH, the car giving should have been private, come on. A kid at a kid's party that turns into a giveaway, and she's not included? How could it go any other way. No, she's not entitled, but just about any kid would feel slighted in that situation.", "NTA. Willa is getting a sense of entitlement that needs to be shut down hard.", "ESH. You obviously don't demand someone give you their children's toys. But y'all also should have been more discrete about giving the old ride on toy to the other child,  especially after seeing the meltdown during gift opening.", "No you're not the asshole, there's nothing that says your daughter has to cater to other kids and she gave away a toy out of the kindness of her heart, not out of obligation. Now Mary sounds like she's twisting it into an obligation.", "Willa is at an age where IT IS acceptable to learn that not everyone gets their way. At 6, kids shouldn\u2019t be crying at not getting a gift at someone else\u2019s birthday. However, you could\u2019ve been a little more discreet with Adelia giving Serena the toy. If Willa saw that, then I don\u2019t blame her for getting upset (or any other kid that might\u2019ve saw) because normally, it\u2019s the birthday kid getting gifts and it\u2019s a little unfair to those attending the party if one other kid gets a gift as well.\n\nTalk with Mary and tell her that it\u2019s unacceptable to have a 6yr old get so upset she has to be taken away to calm down at seeing someone else get presents. Also tell her you were in the wrong for openly letting Adelia give a toy to a friend at the party and should\u2019ve been more discreet about it.\n\nESH.", "This is ridiculous. Adults are ridiculous. I'm saying nta. You had no part in this, and if a child wants to give her toy away, she should be able to.  The child who wanted something but didn't receive something needs to learn that you can't demand someone else's toys. That isn't how life works, and throwing a temper tantrum won't get you someone else's toys too.  This would have been a good learning experience for the parent. Instead, the mother also had a temper tantrum.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Our parents are the ones who did that nonsense, it makes no sense to blame us for things we didn't have a hand in.
