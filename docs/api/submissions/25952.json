We had always been inseparable throughout high school so I excitedly accepted as they were high school sweethearts and they had been planning it for a while (they planned it out and she knew about the proposal before he did it). \n   We will call her B, so B had a total of 4 bridesmaids including me. She created a group chat named (last name) wedding which we were all in. A few months after the proposal B had a falling out with two of the bridesmaids so then it was just me and the other bridesmaid.\n\n   We all went shopping for our dresses, it made it difficult to find shoes because she wanted either a nude color or black color but it could not have anything shiny or sparkly, she also said we could not wear any earrings, necklaces or hair accessories as it would take away from her day, Which I understood. I also asked her where to find her gift registry in which she responded \u201coh we only want cash so we can move\u201d (they still have not moved a year later) \n\n   Well, B and I had always disliked Ali (we will call her Ali) because she was a close friend (basically best friend) of ours before I caught my then boyfriend of 4 years cheating on me with Ali in his bedroom making out half naked. B knew how badly that situation hurt me and she always consoled me, and comforted me when I got upset about it and stated how much she disliked Ali after that.\n   \n\nWell, come time for the bachelorette party, we were all trying on our dresses and the other bridesmaid casually asked \u201cso who all is going?\u201d in which B responded with several names of the people we went to school with.. until she said \u201coh and Ali is going too\u201d in which the other bridesmaid responded \u201cwhy is she going?..\u201d B looked at her feet looking guilty and said \u201cwell she\u2019s my friend..\u201d my heart instantly sank, as we had agreed not to invite the girls we caught our boyfriends cheating on us with (she had a similar situation happen to her) I tried not to seem hurt but I ended up leaving quite upset. \n\n\n   I then texted her that I was dropping out of the wedding in which she responded \u201cfine be like that\u201d\nI texted back \u201cI thought we agreed not to invite Ali or Candy to our weddings\u201d (Candy was the girl she caught cheating with B\u2019s boyfriend) and she said I was just being petty.. Am I the A hole?\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention I dropped off the bridesmaids dress at the venue before this falling out, and she let someone else wear it without my knowledge or permission. When I finally drove 30 miles to pick it up from that person it smelled like BO, stained and was just in general completely ruined. When I confronted B about this she said \u201cwell we had no other choice\u201d. Also for those asking, I am no longer her friend! Or anyone\u2019s friend in that group. \ud83d\ude4f I also asked if Ali was going to bring my ex, in which she replied \u201cI don\u2019t know maybe\u201d.", "created_utc": 1693499040, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/166fovy/aita_for_dropping_out_of_my_best_friends_wedding/", "score": 409, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
