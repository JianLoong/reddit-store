Your parents tried to guilt-trip you, so they suck.\n\nYou didn't not care about your brother. You didn't prioritize your parents' fun time over your prior work commitments. Even if your parents would have scheduled their fun time during a time that you were available, not babysitting wouldn't mean not caring about your brother.

It is true that you are not a good mother to your brother.  This should not surprise anyone, as your mother, not you, is your brother\u2019s mother. Your desire to selfishly use your PTO for yourself, and not for others, is pretty conventional. More to the point, you\u2019re entitled to prioritize and take care of yourself. The people telling you that you\u2019re a bad sister for not parenting your brother are confused. His parents, not you, hold that responsibility. By depending on you to do their job, they\u2019re the ones who have let him down, not you.

Definitely not something you should leave work for. \nCan I suggest you don't answer calls from them when you are at work? Ask them to text if it's important and you MAY be able to respond. If it's important enough respond by text. They'll throw a tantrum, just wait it out. \nGet them used to your being unavailable.\nDon't check your phone if you don't want to, and don't answer texts unless you think it's a real emergency, and then do it by text.\nKeep saving to move out.
