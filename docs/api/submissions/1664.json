You're under no obligation to open communication with Tori, but if contact with you is important to her, perhaps leverage that into her being civil to Kayla, because Kayla might benefit from such contact (assuming, of course, Mike isn't a part of that).", "NTA - So basically people tend to have a vulnerable spot for the sick and dying and I totally get it and empathize with your wife but what you really have to ask yourself even if you were to reach out\u2026 \u201cTo what end?\u201d \nLike realistically and seriously ask yourself and have your wife do the same: \u201cWhat would you hope and expect the consequence of \u201creaching out\u201d to be?\u201d\n\nObviously it would be great if everyone could come together and get closure so there would be no regrets once that opportunity is no longer there.

You can not reconcile by yourself and you can only accept what you are willing to accept. In your position I personally would have to keep my distance. I couldn\u2019t fathom not possibly ending up in jail even being in the vicinity of Mike. And the fact that your sister blames her daughter is triggering ME and this is just a random post as far as I am concerned. So yeah I try to give relatively unbiased advice or at least advocate for people to step back and take an objective view of their situations, and yeah I totally still think you should probably do that, I\u2019m finding it hard to see how reaching out could make anything better. I will say this\u2026 Consider how you are going to feel when she is gone and the opportunity is no longer available. Personally it wouldn\u2019t bother me in the least (well anymore than the current situation would be bothering me to begin with), but I am not you.
