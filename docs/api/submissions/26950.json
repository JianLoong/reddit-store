You are definitely stepping on some toes, and it could be said crossing a line. But I'm letting that slide because they were still under the care of the school (you didn't take them out of school without telling).\n\nYour sister needs a reality check. Forcing a relationship like that won't work, and will drive a wedge further between her kids and her husband, and between her kids and her.", "Esh\n\nYou sister is ignoring her children's wants and needs and trying to force a relationship on them that they don't want, and will resent. What she is doing will make it impossible for them to ever have that relationship with bil.\n\nThat all said, you are not their father, and shouldn't be doing father things with them behind their *actual* parent's back. Their mother should be made aware of the relationship, and should be a part of it. You should talk to her, not just insert yourself in secret, because she *can* actually (and legally) cut you out of their lives.", "You contributed to more conflict between the kids and their mom/ stepdad, so yes, that's TA territory. She's also wrong for ignoring their concerns. ESH.", "NTA solely because the kids wanted you there and you love those kids. Having said that, please understand your sister's situation as well. She is trying to (forcing to which is not ok but still..) bring hers kids and husband closer in hopes of having a happy family. \n\nThe kids lied to their mother and you aiding that lie sends a message that you agree with their thoughts of not accepting their step father as the father figure. This makes things harder for you sister. \n\nUnless you think he is not a good dad figure for the kids, I would suggest talking to them and letting them know that they should give their step dad a fair chance.", "Soft YTA because you didn't get consent of the children's mother. Saying that it's great they have you in their life.", "NTA. I will never understand parents who keep uncles and aunts away, unless said uncles and aunts have a bad influence on the child. They aren't driven by the best interest of the child, it's sheer, meaningless, competition. The more people love my kids, the happier I am for them. End of.", "YTA, but I get it.\n\nI fully understand why you did what you did, and I think that I would have done the same thing with one caveat; I would have told your sister and asked her to be discreet and understanding. You can't be making and keeping secrets like that with someone else's kids, even your own niece and nephew.\n\nRemoving control and input from the parent of kids that age is an asshole thing to do.\n\nI think you had the best intentions, and you should continue to be there for them, but you just have to try to find a balance between giving them what they need and not undermining your sister.\n\nYou play your cards right, and 5-10 years from now, you'll be getting calls in the middle of the night when something has gone wrong. Those are the kinds of things that you can maybe keep secret from mom.", "Your sil needs to open her eyes and understand she cannot force them to accept her husband as a father. Them pushing is just making the kids hid things and not accept him even more. \n\nYou did nothing wrong but be careful, she might try and cut contact with you. I would try to make her understand her push the kids is making them resent him. The actions of the kids should show her that you are right and all the punishment will not change their minds.\n\nShe will end up losing them as soon as they can leave and she will wonder why. \n\nKeep being a awesome uncle.", "YTA. They're not your kids. They are trying to establish their family and you are undermining that effort. Sneaking around behind their parent's back is also super creepy. Its time for you to back off and just stop entiltling yourself to the kids without parental consent.", "YTA\nyou didnt have permission from the actual parent, you encouraged children to lie to their mum.", "I think sometimes doing what is best involves stepping on some toes. You keep putting those kids first, you're an awesome dude.", "Personally, i don't think you're AH since your intentions seemed innocent, but I can see how you ruffled a few feathers by attending the event. I can understand if your sister and BIL are upset, bc the kids should attempt to make some connection w/ their stepdad. So NTA but neither are your sister and BIL", "NTA. Their mum is trying to force a relationship on them they don't want. Sadly, by trying to force it she is making it harder for them to bond with him. They already have a bond with you that is important to them. The wanted to go with the one adult who is truly respecting how they feel and will let them be themselves. Your sister is the AH here.", "NTA for the reason that you obviously love your niece and nephew! It must be so hard for them but also going behind your sisters back makes it more challenging.\nYour sister must be conflicted and hopefully doing her best with the death of their father and trying to integrate her new husband. Is their step father a decent man? I\u2019d apologize to your sister for the deception and maybe offer to hang out with the kids and their stepfather together to help bridge the gap in instead of the way it seems it\u2019s being forced on them by your sister. You can\u2019t force relationships on children especially ones who have lost their  father. Kids move at their own pace. They\u2019re very lucky to have your love and support but your sister is right to be upset since they are her kids. Play more by her \u201crules\u201d so you can always be the uncle those kiddos can confide in!", "ooooof. \n\nESH\n\nbut gently. the kids clearly love and trust you. they need your support. do not do anything that would jeopardize your sister cutting you out. \n\nyour sister is clearly upset about the situation and youre the easiest target. \n\nmaybe take her out to dinner 1:1 and have a long talk. its hard to be a kid and they need all the love and support they can get. reassure her that you had assumed the kids had talked to you about it. and because of previous circumstances you thought it was cool. \nemphasize that you would never actively go against her wishes.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

And ask her what that says about how they feel about her husband and their trust in talking to her. \n\nPoint out that the wedge between the kids, her and her husband are firmly in place, and every forced interaction is a hammer blow onto that wedge.

After reading through some of the other comments (lots of good ideas, though some suck) may I make a suggestion? Have your niece and nephew write their mother a letter expressing their feelings about her, their step-father and how they feel about the forced relationship. Maybe if she can see what they feel expressed in words rather than verbal accusations/arguments/judgments she will have a better understanding of where they are right now.

I have no idea if she would do this... but angry step-parents have been known to get angry enough to demand that sort of thing, and more than a few parents have gone along with it.\n\nI know you meant well, and it's great that you are always there for your niblings... but you should have gotten their actual parent's approval first.  YTA.", "Thats got nothing to do with this at all. The uncle went to their school without permission, without consent of the kid's  REAL parents, and failed to communicate with their mom. You cant force a relationship, but an uncle that fancies himself the father figure sure can \"accidentally \" undermine all efforts to build a relationship.", "Parent, not parents. A step parent does not get to force a relationship. He can hope and demand all he wants to be their dad but he does not get to force it on them. Their mother fails by trying to force that. Parents and step\nParents need to learn they, they can\u2019t force a relationship and not entitled to anything!", "Again. Reread it. It was NEVER about forcing a relationship. It takes time - which is difficult with a guy sabotaging it. He snuck around behi d the REAL PARENT'S  back without permission, entered a school without authority over the kids, and was deceptive in NOT telling the mother at very least. Thats what this is about."]}
