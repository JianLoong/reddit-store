I love dogs but I do not like children, that is my prerogative. You do not owe anyone an explanation for not wanting to take care of their children for even one hour.

I would have laughed them off the block", "NTA - and holy shit. The level of effort between what happened organically between you and the other neighbor and what these folks are asking is not in the same league. And they're going to try to bully you because you won't babysit 2 hours per day for free.", "NTA.\n\nSeriously, how entitled can someone get? Those neighbours are absolutely ridiculous!", "NTA - First of all, your time is your own and they are not entitled to it. Second, taking care of one dog is a lot different than taking care of three children.", "Ask her what your getting in return for 10hrs free work a week... free gardening? Paying your bills? Cleaning your house? Nothing... lol NTA.\n\nIt takes a village but your not part of it. Watching and playing with a dog is a lot less work and a lot more fun than babysitting 3 kids, entertaining them, feeding them (it's lunch time) while trying to have your lunch break. \n\nI hope they got called out for their entitlement when they posted, if not redirect them to all the people who agreed, they can be free babysitters. Also *husband can give up HIS lunch. They are his kids after all...*", "NTA-You aren\u2019t the village babysitter or the village birth control advisor. You are in no way responsible to help care for their children.", "NTA. They want something for nothing. They are selfish and entitled.", "NTA, also we don't treat raising children as gross or criminal, in fact we wholeheartedly invite parents to do it themselves.", "Nta, wtf, no one is obligated to care for someone else's children.", "NTA just because your neighbors have kids doesn't mean you should be responsible for watching them. People who have kids are responsible for those kids not their neighbors who happen to have free time.", "NTA. Dude, these people suck. Walking a dog and watching kids is so vastly different it\u2019s crazy. Those people are losers. If they bug you more get a restraining order. What fucking weirdos they are.", "NTA - negligent and entitled parents are gross and in some cases criminal.", "NTA. Your neighbors sound entitled as hell. Taking a dog out during your break is vastly different than watching 3 children! And she wants you to do that daily!? Nope. Entitled af. You are NTA and good for you for not letting them guilt trip you.", "OMG your neighbors are entitled AH! It never ceases to amaze me that people think it\u2019s okay to use your personal time to help them out. Especially idaily\u2026wow.  Whether you like children or not has nothing to do with it, and seriously speaking time with a low maintenance dog can\u2019t compare with watching 3 kids!!!\nAnd if they\u2019re anything like their entitled parents it would be a living nightmare.\nIf they don\u2019t stop bothering you call the police", "Rofl. This is hilarious. You took your dog on your lunch break to play with another dog. Then, as part of your grieving process over losing your dog, you continued playing with him on your lunch break and they think taking a walk to the dog park is somehow equal to taking care of three small children?!?! Are they on crack?!?! Seriously. And as a side note if I asked someone to watch my kids and they said no...I wouldn\u2019t want them watching my kids bc they don\u2019t want to. I wouldn\u2019t want to put my children in that situation!!!", "NTA - So, they're upset that they don't get a free babysitter, which they are *clearly* entitled to?\n\nBWAHAHAHA - yeahhh, I don't blame ya. At all", "NTA they're not entitled to your time and one dog is not remotely the same as 3 kids.\n\nI hate the 'it takes a village' mindset as people use it to feel entitled to free childcare, and factor in support from people who haven't even agreed to it when deciding to have kids in the first place.", "NTA - What are these people on? They chose to have the kid, you have no relationship with them other than proximity, why on earth would they think that entitles them to free childcare?", "NTA at all. No one is entitled to your time but you, full stop. How you decide to use your time is only your business. Let those neighbors feel offended: they did it to themselves the moment they assumed you would happily sign up for daily, unpaid work, literally ever -- at that point it isn't even a favor anymore but more like a part time job.", "NTA. I\u2019m a parent and I would NEVER throw my kids on a neighbor\u2014especially because I don\u2019t know them very well. First of all, dogs are like 100x easier than kids. Second of all, why in the world would she presume that you\u2019d want to watch her kids. Third, you\u2019re allowed to not like kids, but what a weird accusation to throw at someone.", "\"saying the whole it takes a village concept is dead.\"\n\nYup.  It certainly is.\n\nNTA.

No one gets to volunteer you.\n\n\"They even complained on nextdoor app about how people treat parents with distain as if raising children is something gross or criminal these days.\"\n\nThat's the easiest thing to ignore.  I invite you to.  In fact, you can block their profile and never read their crap again!", "NTA. \n\nDid anyone agree with their diatribe on Next Door?", "NTA- The entitlement is strong with these two.", "NTA - there is a HUGE difference between a dog, and 3 kids", "NTA.\nParents feeling entitled to free childcare is mind boggling.", "NTA\n\nYou owe nothing to these would-be freeloaders. They want free babysitting, and they are rude and selfish enough to make a stink about not getting their way. Shame on them.\n\nJust because you took your neighbor's dog out to play does not mean you're willing to babysit three children for free, during your lunch break.", "NTA. Babysitting isn\u2019t something even teenagers do for free, why on earth would they think an *adult neighbor* would babysit for free IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR WORK DAY? Also, what parent wants someone to watch their kid when they have already said no? Nothing worse than a babysitter who doesn\u2019t want to babysit. The entitlement is STRONG with those two.", "JDF NTA OMG \n\nIt\u2019s not wrong of them to ask for help but they need to accept that you declined. I mean, 3 kids are a lot to handle. Maybe they should have thought of that 2 children ago. \n\nPeople like this couple are also the first to ask but last to offer.", "Completely out of line, very entitled. They choose to have kids, so their responsibility. You had connection with old neighbour, and looking after a dog is completely different than looking after kids. \n\nYou have no responsibility to help them, but also, the kids don\u2019t know you, as a parent I would never ask this of stranger just because you helped the previous owner with their dog.", "NTA! Is this for real? Your neighbors are being beyond entitled!", "NTA. You're not the neighborhood charity, expecting you to look after their children for free is some next level entitled behaviour and even though you are a neighbor, you are a stranger, not a friend or acquaintance to the parents and children. I think because of their entitled and dramatic behaviour there is a good chance you were the only person they could ask.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Are they comparing walking a dog to taking care of 3 children? Seriously? I\u2019m not sure if they understand the difference. Who the heck asks a neighbor to take care of their kids for free because the neighbor is friendly with someone else\u2019s dog and then gets mad when they say no? \n\nI would love to hear what the other neighbors say when the couple complains. I can imagine the conversation. \u201cCan you believe that John, our next door neighbor, won\u2019t provide free babysitting services for our 3 children? He\u2019s so rude. I have important things to do. These nails aren\u2019t going to polish themselves and my hair stylist insists that I get a blow out once a week. Then there is drinks with my friend Beverly, she gets so lonely in the manor with just the housekeeper, butler, and pool boy.

It is a great way to exercise as you are walking and it is relaxing. It in no way compares with taking care of two toddlers for two hours every day on one's lunch break.\n\nAlso doing a favor for a friend doesn't mean that you \\*owe\\* every one else in the world your time. Most people do favors for friends and I am including the previous neighbor with the dog as a friend because presumably they would have bonded over spending time with each other versus someone who just happens to live next door.\n\nFor a \"casual\" neighbor I would help them in an emergency type of situation but certainly not in this situation where they are literally asking me to give up my free time on a daily basis to do something I have no interest in doing.", "First of all- people don\u2019t treat parents with disdain\u2026 unless they\u2019re asshole.
