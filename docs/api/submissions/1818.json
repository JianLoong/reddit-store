I wouldn\u2019t even entertain this conversation with the neighbors since the request is honestly laughable. I feel as though they\u2019re trying to gaslight you into doing what they want when in fact they\u2019re the selfish ones. \n\nThe whole it takes a village applies to reciprocality in helping others as well which I\u2019m sure is nonexistent given their reasoning. It takes a village might be you mentoring a child or helping from time to time should they find themselves in a bind. \n\nWhat you choose to do with your time is none of their business.", "One dog that probably plays a little bit or you take for a walk and they sleep vs 3 little kids.

You're allowed to have your opinions, but frankly it seems like they're projecting or grabbing at straws.\n\n Furthermore, it takes a village doesn't mean \"Hey watch my kids so I can run errands or else I'll throw a fit!\". It means if they had been socially normal, one day you may have taught their kids a skill or God forbid a family emergency struck their family and you watched the kids.

They're being extremely entitled. They're expecting you to watch their children, and you don't even have any.

Those kids aren't in school, which means you'd be looking after three children under the age of five. There's a world of difference between walking your neighbor's dog on a break and caring for three toddlers. I get that the parents are most likely overwhelmed, but the way to ask for help is to actually *ask*, not *tell* your neighbor that they owe you a service worth a lot of money everyday. Holy hell NTA. \n\nOP, I'm going out on a limb here and guessing you're a woman - they're using common tactics used to undercut a woman who sets a reasonable boundary. Pay close attention to what's posted on Nextdoor - screenshot it, and if need be, send a cease and desist. If they attempt character assassination, fight that back. If any other neighbors take their bait and try to guilt you into watching their kids, publicly volunteer them for the job.   \n\n\nAlso, as a fellow work-from-home employee, I am continually shocked at the amount of people who assume that people who work from home do nothing and therefore have all the time in the world to assist them.
