It will be pinned on my profile if you\u2019d like more information.\n\nIf you don't wish to read I'll provide as much info as I can ahead:\n\nIn general, to summarize my older sister's (f29) personality, she is a manipulative, toxic, demanding and spoilt individual who expects everyone to accept her behaviour and demands apologies in situations where she was the wrong one. This is the situation I'm currently in. Last year when I cut off all contact with her, she let my mom know that she won't speak to me unless I AM THE ONE WHO APOLOGISES???? and for what I do not know to this day. So I decuded to stand my ground, cuz she needs to know what it's like to not have something go your way for once and be told no for the first time. This landed me in the 'blocked list' to this day.\n\nSo we found out she got engaged in the beginning of this year, and my family is really small (we only have 6 people including me). Traditionally, everyone in the family shows up to the wedding without a formal invite, just because they're family. However, my sister SPECIFICALLY called my (other) sister and mother, to let them know that I'm the only one in the family UNINVITED from the wedding, which, imagine being the only person in the family to be singled out for something I wasn't even in the wrong for. Ofcourse my family was really pissed off at her (they all know her personality and what she's like. My mother wanted to cut off contact with her a few times before as well).\n\nSo the wedding happened this week, and when she realised that I didn't show up, she got mad. According to my (other) sister who went to the wedding, my older sister wanted to 'make peace' with me at the wedding. Which to me, if I'm not even invited, do you just expect me to show up anyways???? Even if I was magically re-invited, I don't think I would have went either, since she took so much time to plan to initially un-invite me, call my family, personally tell them. And that, trully showed her relationship towards me.\n\nSo, AITA for not going to my sisters wedding? In my opinion, her being angry at me for not even showing up right now is some hardcore gaslighting, since now this is YET ANOTHER thing she'll be expecting an apology for.\n\nTDLR; AITA for not going to my sisters wedding after being uninvited? Do I owe her an apology for not showing up? Since she is pretty mad and expecting YET ANOTHER apology that I didnt show up. Should I have went even if I wasn't invited?", "created_utc": 1686149781, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/143fg9u/aita_that_i_didnt_show_up_to_my_sisters_wedding/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Wt*f did I just read. She gets mad you didn't show up to a wedding she specifically told you you weren't invited to?........\n\nYou owe her no apology and all.", "NTA, you were explicitly uninvited. Seems to me that sister was trying to set up a situation where she'd play the victim either way.", "NTA\n\nIf you say to me: \"you're not invited\", I won't show up.\n\nThis is another move from your manipulative sister to put you under a bad light or find ground for a clash, or whatever passes in her mind, while she plays the victim *\"I wanted to make peace but my cruel sister couldn't be bothered to come to my wedding.\"*\n\nStay NC and enjoy your life.", "NTA. It's ridiculous to think you'd show up somewhere you were specifically uninvited from attending.  Sounds like your sister really likes to play the victim.", "NTA, and it doesn't even need explanation. You're right. She's gaslighting you, and you need to maintain your NC stance for your own sanity.\n\nMy armchair psychologist obsession with personality disorders makes me suspect she has Borderline Personality Disorder. Possibly Narcissistic or Histrionic Personality Disorders. I suggest reading up on these. Learning about BPD helped me process all the awfulness I experienced with my grandmother, even though she'd never been diagnosed. (The list of symptoms fit her almost perfectly.)", "NTA. She uninvited you of course you\u2019re not going to just turn up, no one would do that. You\u2019re much better off staying no contact.", "NTA. The manipulation levels are off the charts, continue with being no-contact and move on. All she\u2019s doing is validating your reasoning for cutting her off in the first place.", "so - just to get things straight in  my head - you are no contact, she made a big point of telling anyone with an ear that you were not invited to the wedding, you did not go to the wedding, and now she is angry you did not show up???\n\nAHA - solved it!!!  She wanted you to show up so she could shout and scream and claim for years to come that you ruined her whole day!\n\nNTA", "NTA. Why are you giving this person any thought, at all? You should've already made it known to people not to bring her up, to you, for ANY REASON.", "NTA honestly I would not apologize. Until every one quits catering to her she isn\u2019t going to change. They are enabling her bad behavior.", "So big sister wanted an apology for Hades knows what.  Since, you didn't apologized she went out of her way to NOT invite you to her wedding (deepest condol\u00e9ances to the groom btw) and now she is mad and expects an apology from you for not showing up to her wedding?\n\nHmmm... yeah... nope!  SHE is the AH!  And a narcissistic AH at that!  \n\nWith going NC and not going to the wedding you have done everything right op.  All you need to do now is tell everyone in the family to not talk about her in your presence and you'll be free of her and mental deficiencies.\n\nNTA, op, NTA.", "NOT THE ASSHOLE. She sounds very immature and toxic. Expecting you to beg her to reinvite you or showing up after specifically receiving a non-invitation is so narcissistic. You owe her nothing.", "I'm sorry, I laughed so hard when You wrote she got mad at you for not showing up. \"Why she didn't come?! I just made sure everyone knows she's uninvited, it's not like I MEANT it! The audacity of my sister!!!\" Your sister is something else. NTA", "NTA. Why are you giving so much time and energy to such a toxic person? As long as you keep playing her game with her, she is the winner. Let go of her, let go of this. Save yourself years of dancing to her tune and just end this relationship completely. Stop engaging, and don't let your family keep dragging you back in.", "NTA.  You were specifically uninvited to the wedding.  Your sister's idea of \"making peace\" probably involved forcing you to apologize for whatever she perceived your wrong against her to be. \n\nStand your ground and do not apologize for any of it!", "NTA.  You were specifically not invited. You don't go to places you are not invited to go, if you're not an asshole.  You couldn't have known she wanted to \"make up\" at the wedding if she didn't tell you.  *Because, and I may be cynical or jumping to conclusions, but I don't think she wanted reconciliation at all.  She still doesn't.* \n\nHere's what she Really wanted.  1.  A Big Scene at her wedding where she could dramatically kick you out for crashing, telling everyone how big a jerk you are for trying to \"ruin her day\" or 2.  A Bigger Dramatic Scene where she accepted your apology on bended knee as The Bigger Person on her wedding day, making sure to tell everyone how terrible you are and how gracious she is to forgive you or 3.  She wanted a gift or money or some kind of favor from you on the day itself. \n\nStay NC, don't apologize.  If it's not for this, it'll be something else.  There was not a scenario where you could have come out a winner here.  She wants drama.  Don't give her what she wants.  Ignore it all.  She'll eventually get bored (might take a few years, but)she'll turn her vitriol to someone else.  Probably her poor new husband.", "NTA at all, but you are part of the cause of the situation you find yourself in.  \n\nIf you've gone no-contact and are blocked by your sister, how do you know all these details of the wedding and specifically that you aren't invited? \n\nYou shouldn't be speaking to other people about your sister and what she's up to. You know what would help your mental health? Not thinking about your sister, not thinking about if you're an asshole for skipping the wedding, not thinking about what your sister is mad about that she demands an apology for.  \n\nAt this point you shouldn't know if your sister is pregnant, moving to another country, donating a kidney, buying a house, none of it.\n  \nCut her out of your life fully and move on. Don't talk to your other family member or friends about her or what she is up to.  Move on.", "Nta", "NTA \n\nMaybe they should've invited you if they wanted to make peace with you.", "NTA. No contact is the solution.
