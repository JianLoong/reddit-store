You're 18 now and even at 16 they usually let you have a say.", "NTA. Your mom is majorly TA here for allowing you to be treated this badly by her husband, who is clearly an AH. The blatant favoritism he has shown his daughter is appalling. You seem like a good guy and your working while in school and paying rent. You deserve better. I hope you find a place to live soon. Maybe go back to your dad? The Bay is a hard place to live on a budget. Good luck", "NTA- the fact that your mom never stepped up to defend you, says a lot. She should have been pushing the same treatment of you as your stepsister. \n\nDo you still have contact with your dad? You need to reach out to him. You need to get far away from your mom and stepdad and that fully toxic environment.", "NTA I didn't have to finish reading to decide that. You are 18 with a job and literally paying bills. Its pretty obvious that he wasnt a good father and raised a brat. I dont see any need why you should feel like an asshole. Based off what i read it seems likes hes been a jerk to you. For someone whos supposed to be a step dad he sure isnt fit to be one. What you said was for sure justified in his actions.", "Very soft ESH in my opinion. Your stepdad is obviously a huge asshole for clearly making his daughter the favorite, and your mom should not allow you to be treated like that. However, you started the fight, so you get a little blame for it. It\u2019s clear you all need to figure out household rules and expectations because this shit seems toxic.", "hes in Texas, I go to college here so it would be pretty hard", "Wow they make you do all the chores on top of college and work?", "Everything except cooking on the weekends, then it's mainly my mom I'm just there to help"]}
