As Physical therapists, we are in close contact with these patients. Would you want your therapist to pick you because of how you looked? \n\n\n\nI am a physiotherapy intern working in an out patient setting. There's 5 (3 men, 2 women) of us and we see cases all day. There's all kinds of people coming here. One of us is a guy who I'm going to call Aaron. Aaron isn't a bad therapist, he does his job, his patients like him and he has many regulars.\n\n\n\n\nOur system allows us to follow a rotation based on which patients are assigned to each of us, but we can override the system because no one really supervises it. We sometimes take patients when it's not our turn if there's patients who need only female therapists, or if there's a language barrier. I've been noticing for the past month that Aaron has been volunteering to take patients who are always 1 - female 2 - pretty and tall and (idk if this is crude) but 3 - have bigger breasts.\n\n\n\n\nI counted and he's done this 13 times. Maybe I am mistaken, but I think that is creepy. So at lunch yesterday, we were all eating and discussing random things and I asked him why he's doing that. I said \"how do all the pretty patients end up getting treated by you?\"\n\n\n\n\nHe was defensive, and said he's just taking on more cases to lessen everyone else's workload. He turned it on me and said I'm keeping track of what people are doing, that he's just trying to be helpful. He even called me jealous. I tried to argue back but no one else said anything so it felt like I was imagining it.\n\n\n\n\nNow everyone is being cold to me. The only other girl told me she noticed it too but said that maybe I'm overreacting. The rest of them have distanced themselves from me and have accused me of trying to start drama.\n\n\nAm I the asshole here?

I\u2019m so surprised by the number of people saying YTA", "YNTA. As a woman with a flat chest who's not very attractive, I appreciate you for speaking up. One of the reasons I left healthcare because the biases were insane. I don't want to get too much into the topic of your post, because it's pretty triggering for me, but I was fondled and treated like a blow up doll by a gynecologist when I was in my early twenties, he kept on telling everybody on the floor how small my cervix was, and he asked me if he could call in a few other doctors to show them. It was humiliating. Then, after they all left, he kept asking if he could go back and see and again. I later asked my female gynecologist if my cervix was small, and she said it was average size and there was no reason for him to do that to me at all.", "NTA \n\nHis response makes it even more clear that you made the right choice to bring it up in a group setting. There are so many ways he could have responded to alleviate your concern. But he doubled down on creepy. Good for you for saying something.", "Medical professionals including physical therapists have a higher expectation for appropriateness and professionalism, given the work you do with patients. He was using a system loophole to deliberately re-assign young women to himself, 13 times is beyond a clear pattern. \n\nI've worked with SA victims for so long, and even among my female friends so many of us have a story about creepy dudes in these kind of settings. Given his shady way of quietly rescheduling, avoiding telling anyone about this, and defensive aggressive reaction, I think he would have escalated this behaviour and put clients at risk..", "NTA. To everyone saying \u201cwell are the patients uncomfortable???\u201d. I\u2019m sure the patients would be very uncomfortable finding out their PT was specifically picking them for how they looked", "NTA. Both you and the only other woman coworker noticed his pattern and it was incredibly brave of you to call him out on that, and the other men know wtf he is doing and are enablers and turning a blind eye. This is incredibly predatory behavior on his part, and it's disturbing to see all of the dismissive comments claiming YTA, from I imagine to be cishet men that don't see how this is a major red flag. SA is a serious issue within any male dominated field but unfortunately, especially in medical fields.", "NTA \n\nYour coworker\u2019s behavior is unethical and creepy. Imagine if his patients knew why their physical therapist picked them out of a crowd. I highly doubt your coworker is oblivious to what he\u2019s doing. The fact that his response was, \u201cWhy are you keeping tabs on me\u201d and \u201cYou\u2019re just jealous\u201d, is a way to gaslight and shift the blame to you. Don\u2019t back down. Please advocate for your patients.", "NTA. Doctors should not be selecting their patients based on their physical preferences. What he is doing is creepy and highly inappropriate.", "NTA -  He sounds like a grade a creeper", "NTA.  Trust your gut. Especially if another coworker has also noticed this. That's creepy af. Hopefully just your mentioning it to him will make him stop. \nINFO: Have there been any patient complaints or is he obviously hitting on them?", "NTA - Not sure how PT internship works but it sounds like you pissed of an office favorite by calling him out on his bad behavior, and now the whole office is icing you out in order to not draw his ire.", "NTA. You called out creepy, unethical behavior. If more people did what you did, the world would be a better place. Unfortunately, most people (like your coworkers) think maintaining the status quo is more important than doing what is right.", "NTA. Doctor here, and when training, I can recall many episodes where my seniors were creepy, referring to TUBEs- totally unnecessary breast examinations and a consultant breast surgeon getting excited by a patient having massive breasts, getting groped by a doctor teaching us etc etc. This is 25 years ago, but that was the stuff they were saying in front of medical students then so away more goes on behind closed doors, and I\u2019m sure it is still similar but people are better at hiding it. At the time, as a 20/21/22 year old, it felt really wrong but I didn\u2019t know what to do about it.\n\nCan you alert a female senior or discuss your concerns with a manager? You may wish to get better documentation though to make sure they don\u2019t rug sweep.", "NTA. I\u2019m a man and I think this sounds pretty dang gross. Good on you for trying to do the right thing.", "I'd distance myself from him because I see a lawsuit in his future.", "I\u2019d report him. He has access to these women\u2019s personal information. He clearly cannot be trusted to behave ethically. NTA", "Nta.\n\n  \"Your jealous\" and \"causing drama\" is gaslighting 100% to take the heat off him.   If his clients knew he was cherry picking based on breast size and appearance they would be disgusted. \n\nI personally would discuss it with a super or HR. Assuming there isnt a \"good ol boys\" group running the show.", "I think the fact that he tried to say you were \u201cjealous\u201d speaks volumes.

Talk to your surpervisor/manager/boss and they can handle the situation.", "[deleted]", "Info-are these only repeat patients, or are any of them new?  Because how would he know what they look like before he starts working with them?  I\u2019m just wondering if it is possibly confirmation bias; like, he happened to get assigned a few clients you deem attractive (or think he would find attractive), and then you started paying attention every time he gets a new client that is attractive, to the point you started counting (which is pretty weird).\n\nThe fact that other coworkers are taking his side suggests that you might be reading more into this than is there.", "INFO: did you survey everyone's patients to see how many tall model types each of you helped?  \n\nIf not, this is a serious allegation that you flippantly threw out at lunch in front of coworkers. if you had a concern, it should have been brought up privately with him or with your supervisor.", "I just find it weird you actually counted the number of times and you actually categorized the women . Seems like you aren\u2019t busy enough. Asides that, has any of these women complained about abuse or something like that? Is it on record that this co-worker actively rejects other cases that don\u2019t fit the profile you described?\nYTA and so is your colleague if he rejects other cases. Basically ESH in that context.\nBut if he doesn\u2019t reject other cases and this is you being paranoid or slightly jealous . It\u2019s just you being AH. Face your job and mind your business.", "YTA. If you want to accuse someone of something, you do it privately.\n\nIs he harassing/abusing his patients? \n\nAnd where in the country are you working that in a month, there\u2019s 13 separate patients that Aaron can hijack?", "I would say YTA as its not your concern what sort of patients he's taking. He isn't doing anything wrong and he doesn't have to go out of his way to please you. He might be taking what's available or maybe he's choosing but as long as he's delivering a professional service, its not your business. It appears that you wanted to do the same and somehow find A taking up the patients you possibly wanted resulting in you keeping tabs or else you wouldn't have noticed this in the first case. So looking at others through the lens you use to look at everything is the reason why others are staying away from you. Its wise to stop cross examining others based on your perceptions and in a workplace not to cause such unprofessional drama with allegations that may or may not have a base.", "YTA. He has done nothing unethical. Just because you don\u2019t like it doesn\u2019t make it your business.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Every system is really a collection of humans keeping to the status quo in self interest.\n\nNTA OP, you took a good risk imho.

But now that ship has sailed, you\u2019re the snitch\u2026and would be suspect one if you tell.\n\nETA: Personal peeve of mine. It\u2019s as simple as adding a field in your system as to why a patient is manually (re)assigned. Have preset options:\n\n- language preference\n- gender preference\n- availability / backlog (re. if not enough people are in to handle the load)\n\u2026etc\u2026\n\nThey have a system in place that works of automated rotation for a reason. It maybe an idea to give HR a general suggestion, if the other colleague is willing to back you.

What you're doing is slander bordering on character assassination. If you don't have more than what you've shared here (which is little more than your \"gut,\" which FYI is not evidence,) you're, in my opinion, on ethically shaky ground to be accusing anyone of anything.\n\nDoes he behave inappropriately with these patients? Do they appear uncomfortable? Do they have negative outcomes? Unless you can say yes to any of them, you're miles out over your skis.\n\nThe problem with slandering a coworker this way in a professional environment is that they have legal rights and can sue you over false accusations which harm them.\n\nMy advice is to tread lightly and not make any more accusations without evidence that goes beyond a hunch.", "If she wanted to confront him she should say something more direct. The way she phrased it was snarky and unprofessional. I think it's pretty heinous to go around accusing people of sexual harassment for what little \"proof\" she has.

For example, if a PT specializes in sports injury their patients will be much younger and statistically more likely to be considered \"attractive\" than someone dealing with elderly mobility issues.\n\nSecond, If that's every month or happens regularly? That's a pattern. If it's just last month, calling it a pattern is not supported by the facts because once isn't a pattern.\n\nMaybe dude is a creep, maybe not -- we have enough information to justify monitoring his activities but not enough to say with absolute certainty he's a predator who needs to be removed.\n\nWorse, by going off half cocked like this, she's effectively guaranteed she'll get none of the outcomes she wants because she closed off her avenue to gather additional useful evidence. A predator would cover his tracks by seeing unattractive patients next month. But a regular person not selecting by attractiveness would also be very likely to see less attractive patients next month.\n\nBy going off half cocked she's made herself into an unreliable witness by declaring a pattern prematurely.
