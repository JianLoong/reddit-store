As Physical therapists, we are in close contact with these patients. Would you want your therapist to pick you because of how you looked? \n\n\n\nI am a physiotherapy intern working in an out patient setting. There's 5 (3 men, 2 women) of us and we see cases all day. There's all kinds of people coming here. One of us is a guy who I'm going to call Aaron. Aaron isn't a bad therapist, he does his job, his patients like him and he has many regulars.\n\n\n\n\nOur system allows us to follow a rotation based on which patients are assigned to each of us, but we can override the system because no one really supervises it. We sometimes take patients when it's not our turn if there's patients who need only female therapists, or if there's a language barrier. I've been noticing for the past month that Aaron has been volunteering to take patients who are always 1 - female 2 - pretty and tall and (idk if this is crude) but 3 - have bigger breasts.\n\n\n\n\nI counted and he's done this 13 times. Maybe I am mistaken, but I think that is creepy. So at lunch yesterday, we were all eating and discussing random things and I asked him why he's doing that. I said \"how do all the pretty patients end up getting treated by you?\"\n\n\n\n\nHe was defensive, and said he's just taking on more cases to lessen everyone else's workload. He turned it on me and said I'm keeping track of what people are doing, that he's just trying to be helpful. He even called me jealous. I tried to argue back but no one else said anything so it felt like I was imagining it.\n\n\n\n\nNow everyone is being cold to me. The only other girl told me she noticed it too but said that maybe I'm overreacting. The rest of them have distanced themselves from me and have accused me of trying to start drama.\n\n\nAm I the asshole here?

One of the reasons I left healthcare because the biases were insane. I don't want to get too much into the topic of your post, because it's pretty triggering for me, but I was fondled and treated like a blow up doll by a gynecologist when I was in my early twenties, he kept on telling everybody on the floor how small my cervix was, and he asked me if he could call in a few other doctors to show them. It was humiliating. Then, after they all left, he kept asking if he could go back and see and again. I later asked my female gynecologist if my cervix was small, and she said it was average size and there was no reason for him to do that to me at all.", "NTA \n\nHis response makes it even more clear that you made the right choice to bring it up in a group setting. There are so many ways he could have responded to alleviate your concern. But he doubled down on creepy.

To everyone saying \u201cwell are the patients uncomfortable???\u201d. I\u2019m sure the patients would be very uncomfortable finding out their PT was specifically picking them for how they looked", "NTA. Both you and the only other woman coworker noticed his pattern and it was incredibly brave of you to call him out on that, and the other men know wtf he is doing and are enablers and turning a blind eye. This is incredibly predatory behavior on his part, and it's disturbing to see all of the dismissive comments claiming YTA, from I imagine to be cishet men that don't see how this is a major red flag. SA is a serious issue within any male dominated field but unfortunately, especially in medical fields.", "NTA \n\nYour coworker\u2019s behavior is unethical and creepy.

You called out creepy, unethical behavior. If more people did what you did, the world would be a better place. Unfortunately, most people (like your coworkers) think maintaining the status quo is more important than doing what is right.", "NTA. Doctor here, and when training, I can recall many episodes where my seniors were creepy, referring to TUBEs- totally unnecessary breast examinations and a consultant breast surgeon getting excited by a patient having massive breasts, getting groped by a doctor teaching us etc etc. This is 25 years ago, but that was the stuff they were saying in front of medical students then so away more goes on behind closed doors, and I\u2019m sure it is still similar but people are better at hiding it. At the time, as a 20/21/22 year old, it felt really wrong but I didn\u2019t know what to do about it.\n\nCan you alert a female senior or discuss your concerns with a manager?

Seems like you aren\u2019t busy enough. Asides that, has any of these women complained about abuse or something like that? Is it on record that this co-worker actively rejects other cases that don\u2019t fit the profile you described?\nYTA and so is your colleague if he rejects other cases. Basically ESH in that context.\nBut if he doesn\u2019t reject other cases and this is you being paranoid or slightly jealous . It\u2019s just you being AH.

He isn't doing anything wrong and he doesn't have to go out of his way to please you. He might be taking what's available or maybe he's choosing but as long as he's delivering a professional service, its not your business. It appears that you wanted to do the same and somehow find A taking up the patients you possibly wanted resulting in you keeping tabs or else you wouldn't have noticed this in the first case. So looking at others through the lens you use to look at everything is the reason why others are staying away from you. Its wise to stop cross examining others based on your perceptions and in a workplace not to cause such unprofessional drama with allegations that may or may not have a base.", "YTA.
