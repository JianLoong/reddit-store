She told me what types of photos she wanted and I gave her a quote of just under 1k. Wedding happens, I take the pictures, I edit them, then wait for payment which we agreed I'd get in full after the wedding before sending any pictures. However suddenly she didn't have money and wanted to set up a payment plan to pay it off in 8 months AND still get the pictures now. It's not that I don't trust her but once you start opening such doors you'll find it hard to close them so I told her we could do the payment plan but the photos will only be released when the full amount is paid (didn't even add interest). She didn't respond. February rolls in and she asks to at least see 'samples' to confirm that they were worth the price. I sent 4 pictures and she says she'll show them to her husband and get back to me. Cue silence for a week or two until I asked for an update and she responded saying she's still discussing it with him. I told her this was getting long and she must just start paying now and she ignored me again.\n\nSo I'd saved the photos on my roommate's flash drive temporarily while I was waiting on an actual hard drive. June came around and he texted me while I was at work saying he needed to use it and took it from my room but saw that there were still files on it. He couldn't move it to his laptop because it didn't have space (thus him needing the flash) so he was 'asking' if he could delete the files. I saw fine and he deleted them. I still had about 20 of the photos saved on my phone from when I was choosing/sending the samples so I just explained the situation in a message to her and sent the existing photos free of charge.\n\nThat was last month and I'm still getting flamed for this. She's been slandering me online and it's quite literally created a division between our families and to the point that our mums don't talk now. I obviously feel bad but also feel like given the circumstances, I wasn't really in the wrong though still acknowledge that it's obviously very shitty for her that I would've wished to avoid.

This had gone on longer than any store would hold shoes on layaway.

Add up the slandering\u2026 she\u2019s in huge A H territory.\n\n\nProblem here is your postponing doing the backup for around 6 months. But still, NTA. She tried to get your work for free, refused to acknowledge her previous arrangement with you and then cried when she didn\u2019t get everything for free. Can\u2019t you send a cease and desist?", "Don\u2019t. Do. Business. With. Family.", "It is for this exact reason I refused to have my nephew and niece in my class when I taught. Do NOT mix professional and family life. It rarely works out well.", "NTA.\nShe played around too much and continued to drag out her responses. No payment, no photos. Simple. Family or not, she was given options. She didn't respond in a timely manner with a solution. Now she gets nothing. I don't understand why people hire others for their services if they don't even have the money. Surely everybody else got paid. I'm sure she was hoping as family you would just say \"F\" it and hand them over if she dragged long enough.", "You have a business and the agreement was she would pay you XXX amount for those pictures. She had no intention to pay you because 1. she probably over spent on the wedding and 2. A lot of people take advantage of their family. You tried to work with her but if you would have gave her the pictures upfront you might have seen 1/8 months of payment or a couple then it would have stopped. That\u2019s why they always say never to in business with family", "ESH\n\nI agree with not sending the photos until you received the money.  She was obviously planning on stiffing you.  However, if this is how you handle your product (borrowing a flash drive to store the only copy of someone's photos), you should give up the claim to being any sort of professional photographer.", "They were your photos.

You never agreed to give your services for free.", "NTA. I'd say it would have been ideal if you had been able to get the photos saved/moved elsewhere or dropped her a message to say that the files would need to be deleted soon so she had a chance to respond to you about payment but you've explained that it wasn't possible at that time.\n\n Its a shit situation but she still hadn't paid you or let you know what was happening and enough time had passed.", "ESH\n\nThere is no way you are \"semi-professional.\" A professional has multiple backups of paid work. I used to own a studio and I had every file backed up on a hard drive AND stored in the cloud. It is irresponsible to store them solely on a flash drive. I'm willing to bet your work probably wasn't worth the $1000 and that is why she didn't want to pay. \n\nOwning a camera doesn't make you a professional. I don't care how nice of a camera it is. Professionalism means treating it like a business and taking responsibility for safely storing  your images. \n\nShe sucks for not paying you. But you suck too.", "NTA - She backed out of paying you after agreeing to. Wow. I have zero idea how anyone can blame you for this.", "NTA. But always ask for full payment before you do the job.

It seems to me that your cousin was ALWAYS planning to stiff you and thought you would just accept it.", "NTA, but you need to get a deposit up front for something like this, regardless of her being family.", "NTA\n\npayment was not made after months. Cousin never got back to you about pictures being worth the price. You were even extra nice by sending them the extra 20 on your phone. I wouldn\u2019t have. Family has learned that you are not a doormat", "NTA. She never even paid you, I\u2019d have deleted the rest off my phone too. You\u2019re honestly too generous.", "NTA  \nShe made a contract and didn't pay.  The photos did not belong to her.  You did make some mistakes though.  \n\nEither this is business or family, and treat it as such.  If it is business then treat them no different than any other client.  If you are doing this as a \"for family\" thing, let it just be your gift to them.  Because of this family discount, she wants you to work like a professional, but treat her like it is a family freebie.  Typically wedding photography is 50% deposit at booking and remainder paid in full 30 days before date.  You messed up by not following this.  If you had shown up day of and \"I have not been paid, so I'm not here to work\" then everything is above board, some butt will be hurt, but expectations will be clear.  Since you did take pictures though, now you have to argue with family that the pictures they are in are not their pictures, but instead are yours because you clicked the button.  You also created a problem for yourself when you sent the 20 on the phone and explained the deletion.  You were never going to get paid, so the answer is stop chasing them, and if they did ever come back and want them just explain you don't have them anymore and blame it on whatever reason you want.  If they hadn't have waited so long, they could have had them.", "Nta you weren\u2019t paid for a service you performed. Not her property until she pays for it.", "NTA. You were generous honestly. She didnt pay for ANY photos and you still gave her some. Honestly you would not be TA if you had deleted them without the backups. It is clear she used you for a free photographer and had no plans to pay.", "I'm a hobby photographer and still back up every raw image I take to at least 2 drives and cloud storage.\n\nYou aren't semi-pro using your mates flash drive...\n\nESH.", "NTA \n\nShe asked you, you gave her a price. If you were a professional photographer, she would\u2019ve had to pay up front or she wouldn\u2019t have even had one present.", "NTA but why do family members think, oh so and so does this, so we can get it cheap, rather than let\u2019s support them in their business venture.", "Maybe she should have paid you for your work as agreed. \n\nNTA", "ESH.\n\nShe was trying to stiff you. She\u2019s obviously an A.\n\nHowever, if you are going to take professional jobs you need to have the equipment necessary before the job, not after. You should not have agreed to the job if you didn\u2019t have the memory space to store the photos safely. \n\nDid you have a contract? What did it say about payment? \n\nWhile your cousin is wrong to have never paid you your choices sound far from professional.", "ESH\n\nFormer freelance photographer here\u2026 what quality, file size, and type of photos did you take that they all fit comfortably on your buddies flash drive??? Every photo I\u2019ve ever taken had to be put on a hard drive because the original images are huge! To me, that lets me know your photos probably were not good quality. \n\nShe also obviously sucks for not wanting to pay for them.", "ESH. I don't understand why you wouldn't have important photos backed up. So easy and inexpensive to do today. \n\nYour cousin is also an asshole for not paying you. I am quite she sure thought you would eventually give in and just hand them over for the sake of peace in the family. \n\nI would not have given her one single picture until she paid, and I would have given her a deadline before the photos were deleted.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

First all of, it's careless and unprofessional to store them only in 1 place with no backup, not to mention that it wasn't evwn your own device. What if she had paid but they got deleted accidentally before you managed to send them to her? A wedding is not a photoshooting that you can just repeat (and even then it would be terrible on your part). Secondly, you had no right to delete the photos without giving her a warning. I completely understand that you didn't want to send them before you received the payment, and it sucks that she backtracked on your original agreement (my guess is that the wedding turned out to be more expensive than planned and that's why they're struggling to make the payments?). But as long as she didn't give you a definite \"No\" and was still thinking things over, you had no right to do this. Storing photos is practically free dude, it wouldn't have cost you anything (and kept your chance of still getting payed for your work alive!) if you had just held on to the photos.

The time to dispute payment isn't after you did the work.", "ESH, them more than you but still.  It's been 7-8 months, 5+ months since she said she was still discussing with him and ignored you, so IMHO you were not going to get paid, and I don't know why you sent any of them, BUT the reason for the ESH is that you didn't communicate with them before nuking the photos.  \n\nYou should have given them a chance - as in hey, I understand you guys don't want to pay for these so I'm going to have to delete them now, and if they tried to demand them for free or blew up on you, you would not have been the AH at all.

If this wasn't family, and you were just a random photographer you can pretty much chalk it up to no money no product, and you are free to get rid of them, but this was family.  I don't think you were exactly wrong or anything I think your cousin is in the wrong for having an agreement than going back on it, but I feel like you should have warned her first that if she didn't pay up you'd delete them, but not much you can do about it now.  I guess sort of want to say ESH, but I feel your cousin is worse than you.

Like seriously, you can buy a terabyte hard drive off Amazon that will arrive in 1 day for like $50.

Typically, at the very least, it should be stored on a physical hard drive, with at least one backup.\n\nAll work should have written contracts before starting any project.

Keep them for at least three years. Sometimes clients may lose their files and turn to you for help long after the project is done.

You claim to be a semi-professional, yet not having written contracts to protect yourself from disputes was almost predictable even before the work began.If you are certain that she is not just procrastinating due to difficulty in making a decision, but rather trying to avoid payment, make sure to send an email warning her that if she doesn't confirm within a month, you will delete the files.

It\u2019s perfectly fine to delete them at that point\n\nThat probably depends what the contract said. This type of thing is what contracts are for, and why they should include a clause about what will happen if payment is not received by X amount of time since the wedding. If the contract didn't say anything about this (or if there was no written contract to begin with, the OP didn't even mention one), that's on the photographer. The client needs to have some kind of warning that if payment is not made by X time, the photos will be deleted. If that was included in the contract, or if the OP at the very least verbally communicated that at some point, then N T A. But it sounds like that was not the case, this was not planned, it just cropped up when the files happened to become an inconvenience in storage space and were deleted with no warning. If someone is struggling to pay for a service, they deserve to know that there's a time limit on payment or all will be forever lost.\n\nSo I would say ESH - the cousin for not paying immediately, the OP for deleting presumably with no warning/contract.\n\nAlso, as a former professional photographer, I would never delete any photos I took, if only just for my own profile.

OP's friend could have driven to the local WalMart and bought another drive if one was needed.\n\nESH", "I don't think it's fair in this case to say anything about the cousin treating op (or not treating) as a business vendor, when the fact is neither person treated this like a business transaction fully.  \n\n\n\"At no point were those photos ever her property, as she never completed the transaction and attempted to skirt by without ever doing so.\" - And now never will, there is no product to pay for. I have waited over a year for payment from clients..is it right..no..does it happen..yes. \n\nCousin is an AH, yes. \n\nOp is also an AH and didn't treat it like a business. Storing files on a borrowed thumb drive is not business or professional. It's relevant to the story and judgement, not a red herring, completely descriptive of the \"professionalism\" of this whole situation. We cant argue about professional and legal property for a job and omit details that show the level of professionalism we are talking about. This is character judgement after-all, not legal. \n\n\"Most wedding photographers don\u2019t hold on to pics if they know they\u2019re not getting paid for longer than a few months.\" - Most professional photographers (I am one) absolutely hold onto every single thing they shoot. It's not just about the client and if they pay. It's your product that you make a living from. Every file has potential value down the line, either directly or as portfolio / stock / needed for re-edits that clients may ask for. Whether they have paid after a few months, or never paid after years, they don't get deleted to spite the client at the cost of your own work without some AH behaviour. It only hurts the photographer.   \n\n\n\"I hope you learned never to do business for or with family again.\" - Most likely true. The lesson I have learnt is if its family or friends I am not charging, it gets treated as a favour, and explain clearly that it comes at the cost of professional attention at every second. Free and over deliver. They should be happy.  If you try to do a full professional job for a family discount it will more often end in disappointment from both sides.", "It happens all the time.", "She did not get \"nothing\", she got 20 \"sample photos\" which I suspect is why she did not bother paying for the rest of the photos, she had enough for what she wanted, for right now.", "Which is why she claimed she's semi-professional in the post", "OP states \u201cI told her this was getting long and she must start paying now\u201d.\n\nI would be super pissed if I did work and wasn\u2019t getting paid.", "I doubt OP didn\u2019t have other storage options. I get the impression the whole outcome was somewhat passive aggressive from the moment they realized they likely weren\u2019t going to get paid. They only claimed to be semi-professional. It\u2019s bad business, but I guarantee you if they were a professional photographer those photos would have been deleted at the time the agreement to pay was broken. The fact that OP was family or how the photos were stored is irrelevant. They held on to them longer than a pro would. I mean, I know I would have held on to backups knowing the rift it could potentially cause in the family, but it\u2019s hard to totally blame OP for getting tired of waiting for payment.", "homegirl didn\u2019t pay for 6 months. she didn\u2019t think those photos were irreplaceable.", "Completely agree.

Even strong relationships can be ruined when mixing business.", "This is what I can't get over. I agree that the cousin is 100% being more unreasonable than OP, but OP is selling himself as a professional. A professional would not be in a situation where they just fucking delete all these photos on a whim. There is no reasonable scenario where OP should have lost all the photos at once unless he's not keeping any backups for any of his clients. And if he's not doing that, he's a shitty photographer. If OP had said something like \"I will delete the photos if we have not made an agreement for a payment method by June 30th (or some other date) I would say NTA even if op still had space. The amount of space this should take up on OPs drive maybe a couple bucks.", "Storage space is cheap.

You're real I swear!", "Right so you wait indefinitely for payment without even an assurance that it will come in months? \n\nAlso the money time and stress to go after family for payment ?

OP performed said service and her cousin didn\u2019t fulfill her end of the bargain. Worse yet, it seems like she completely misled OP and never intended on paying. She saw a tiny sample of the photos, so she couldn\u2019t even fall back on an excuse of her not being happy with them. And even if she wasn\u2019t happy with them, some other arrangement or compromise would need to be met.

I just figure someone considering themselves even a semi  professional would know  a thumb drive is not a good primary storage.  It's fine for transferring files to a client, bringing files from home to the office, a quick backup of that month's work etc, but not as your ONLY copy.  I mean I assume these files were edited on a computer, why weren't they saved there, why save only on a USB stick?  And online backup is a must for me even for my own personal photos, because I can have photos on 4 hard drives but if my house burns down those hard drives are gone too, and those are my kids baby pictures etc."]}
