We did this for like 10-15 minutes, maybe, which to me was extra time and anything after the 90 was free lunch.

I said \u201cWho cares are time was up anyway it wasn\u2019t our bay anymore\u201d, he responded saying Top Golf is a restaurant primarily and Golf is only secondary and customers don\u2019t have to leave when their time is up, but when they decide they are done. Sometimes they might want to talk or finish their drinks. I said \u201cWe payed for the bay hourly and at a restaurant you don\u2019t do that. We were sitting in a bay that wasn\u2019t ours at that point and they had every right to make us leave. He said if they are really taking that long they should  ask them to leave and then wait a bit again before telling them they have to go. Whether it\u2019s 5 minutes or an hour, the customer decides when they are done and ready to leave. The place was packed on a Saturday too.\n\n I told him he\u2019s dead wrong n that\u2019s extremely entitled.

This statement is laughably false.  Their food is bar food at best.  Applebee's quality.  It gets the job done, but it's not the draw.\n\nYou pay to use the bay for x amount of time and you leave when you're time is up, especially on a busy Saturday.  If you're not done eating or drinking when your bay time is up, take the food and drink to  one of the many tables around and GTF out of the way.   \n NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou're entirely right, he's being an entitled brat.

You sound a bit more mature in your thinking than your friend. You did the right thing", "NTA - Does he know what booking a slot involves?", "NTA- your friend was being entitled.

Of course you're NTA here.\n\nDoes your friend not follow rules of other places either? I don't care what the primary purpose of a place is, there's rules and when your time is up, then it's time to leave.

If he wanted to stay longer  he should've paid for more time.", ">He said if they are really taking that long they should ask them to leave and then wait a bit again before telling them they have to go.\n\nNTA. Actually, that is EXACTLY what the employee did. The employee approaching and asking if you were extending your time was the \"time to go\", and arriving with the family was \"you have to go.\"\n\nThe issue isn't that the employee was rude. The issue was that the employee was *polite* and very non-confrontational and hospitable, as such your friend did not recognize how she was drawing a boundary. (Probably intentionally.)\n\nAlso let's be real, most employees in that situation believe if they say \"time to go\" to a group of teens they risk a confrontation.", "NTA Your friend is an AH. That lady politely asked if you wanted more time. You declined. Now your friend is mad because you had to leave. Tell him to makeup his mind. Either he wants more time or he doesn't. Can't have it both ways. He y'all didn't then it's time to leave so the next people can have it.", "NTA it has a timer for a reason", "NTA and you are exactly right. The machine asked if you wanted to extend, and then the server asked. Did he think that was just for fun? It\u2019s obviously for booking. He\u2019s being purposefully obtuse and entitled. Does he stay in a theater past the movie he paid to see because he can decide when he\u2019s done? Restaurants in cities will also limit the time and kick your ass out when you overstay your welcome too. \n\nYou book and pay for a time period. After that time period is up, you leave or you pay more. That is the end of it, there is no nuance.", "NTA and I\u2019d hate to have to deal with your friend", "NTA.Your friend does sound entitled. I wonder if he would feel the same and he was waiting for a bay he had reserved?", ">i don't know ANYONE who describes Top Golf as a restaurant\n\nTheres a clue in the name lol", "Not to mention cheap. He clearly wanted to keep playing without having to pay for it.", "This is exactly what I said. I said \u201cIf you actually manage to only begin eating when time runs out we walked past a bunch of tables without bays\u201d and he said it doesn\u2019t matter when there is a table right at the bay, my response was \u201cBut it\u2019s not our bay anymore\u201d and the argument went back to square 1. This repeated a few times lol", "Yeah, he's either being obtuse to avoid losing the argument and \"save face\" or he's very entitled.", "Even when booking some restaurants (even fancy ones) when you book they give you a 90 minute window from your booking time to finish and get out so they can turn the table around.\n\nYour friend is the asshole.", "ESH\n\n> after 90 minutes passed we screwed around with the remaining golf balls we shot out.

Your friend will be so shocked to realize he can't spend 3 hours sitting at a restaurant table on a busy night, either, without the manager coming by to boot him out.\n\nYou are slightly TA for not getting your ass out of the bay when your time was up. Next time, leave BEFORE the server has to \"antagonize\" your idiot friend by literally walking over with the next group.", "NTA\n\nYou paid for time, and overstayed your time, so you were absolutely correct that the employee was allowed to ask you to vacate that area. It's not yours once your paid time is up. You handled this well and your friend is a jerk. The company is called Top Golf, not Top Restaurant That Also Offers Golf For Some Reason. People go there to golf.", "NTA but hoo boy your friend is", "Is that what he would say for a dine in movie also? \"It's primarily a restaurant and a movie secondary\" so I should be able to sit in my seat for as many showings as I want.

Hopefully he grows up.", "the facts: regardless of franchise, this is a business. Each business is entitled to set conditions and procedures relevant to said services provided by the business. The customer agreement is to abide by established conditions and procedures as set by the business. These customers in question had entered and paid for these conditions and procedures. A-hole or not leave that up in the air but this formulated outline is pretty much universal for every establishment.", "they're lucky they didn't get charged for the extra time they took up that space. another 10-15 minutes is definitely excessive when other people are waiting to use those bays.", "Theres something similar here but for cricket. You pay for the time spent playing. Food is just another way to sell extras. Your friend is an asshole and a cheapskate. \nNTA", "Yeah, I'm not familiar with Top Golf (I'm in the UK), but from the description and offers of extending the time, it sounds more like a bowling alley than a restaurant- you pay for the number of frames (which the alley probably estimates take a certain amount of time) and if you haven't extended after you're done, then you vacate the lane your at for other people to use. The fact that they sell snacks and stuff for you to eat in-between frames is irrelevant, once your game is done, you leave."]}
