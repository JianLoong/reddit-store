We clicked no, and a few minutes later, the employee came by and i asked if we wanted to extend our time and we told her no. She swiped her card and typed in whatever and walked off. \n\nWe had eaten earlier during our time and after 90 minutes passed we screwed around with the remaining golf balls we shot out. We did this for like 10-15 minutes, maybe, which to me was extra time and anything after the 90 was free lunch. After that the lady came back with a family who had reserved a bay and said that, in polite terms, time was up. I thought nothing of this and we left and the family got their bay.\n\n On the car ride home, a friend speaks up and says that lady was a total asshole and super rude for bringing the family over when we weren\u2019t done yet. I said \u201cWho cares are time was up anyway it wasn\u2019t our bay anymore\u201d, he responded saying Top Golf is a restaurant primarily and Golf is only secondary and customers don\u2019t have to leave when their time is up, but when they decide they are done. Sometimes they might want to talk or finish their drinks. I said \u201cWe payed for the bay hourly and at a restaurant you don\u2019t do that. We were sitting in a bay that wasn\u2019t ours at that point and they had every right to make us leave. He said if they are really taking that long they should  ask them to leave and then wait a bit again before telling them they have to go. Whether it\u2019s 5 minutes or an hour, the customer decides when they are done and ready to leave. The place was packed on a Saturday too.\n\nI told him he\u2019s dead wrong n that\u2019s extremely entitled. He thinks I\u2019m a stubborn asshole for taking the side of the lady just doing her job but now I\u2019m curious is that how Top Golf actually operates? I feel like when you have a timer you don\u2019t get the freedom like a restaurant to stay however long. AITA?\n\nEdit/ Update: This post did nothing, if that wasn\u2019t a surprise. I said if 800 people UNANIMOUSLY agree that your wrong about something, how are you still right when you are just basically guessing how it works, he said \u201cEveryone can predict what consensus those posts go and Reddit means nothing\u201d \n\nAlso not cutting him off, he\u2019s just an idiot and he\u2019s not a dick in general. He\u2019s actually really good to service people and is the type \u201cEven though tipping sucks, you still do it because it\u2019s the right thing to do\u201d. It\u2019s just being stubborn, when me and him argue if one of us is wrong we either instantly fizzle it out cuz we are wrong or this happens. \n\nThe last point that made no sense to me today was he said \u201cI didn\u2019t actually do any of that I just said that\u2019s what should happen, that doesn\u2019t make me entitled at all you don\u2019t know how to use that word.\u201d", "created_utc": 1683719159, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13do62s/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_hes_being/", "score": 1160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I ain't heard of it before but I feel if it wasnt mainly about the golf they'd call it \"top restaurant.\" But they don't. And that's because it's about the golf. Good on you for having a better grasp on morality then your entitled buddy! And thanks for defending the innocent workers they need it more now then ever.", "NTA: You're right, and even a bit of an asshole for sticking around past your time. But at least you left immediately. Your friend is totally wrong. Who goes to Top Golf for the food?", "Nta", "You are NTA but your friend is. Your perception is spot on.", "NTA, and your friend sounds like a total dink.", "NTA. You\u2019re right. When times up you get your butt out. You don\u2019t get to keep playing after declining when the menu and the server asked if you wanted to extend your time. Top Golf is in the business of making money, if you\u2019re not paying its time to go.", "NTA, I'm not familiar with top golf but it sounds like you were there for 2-3 hours, which is pushing it even if you ARE at a regular restaurant", "NTA and your friend is an entitled ahole.", "NTA. Explain to your friend it's just like a bowling alley. You don't get to sit on a lane just because you aren't done eating, especially if the lane is being taken since you are done. You freaking move.\nAlso the Top Golf near me has tables inside where people can move to after golfing to get food. If yours has the same setup then you guys could have just taken a table inside.", "NTA your friend is 100,0000 percent entitled, and I'd have called him out way worse than that. In fact, OP I'm very proud of you for actually defending the moral stance instead of just having to avoid an argument with your friend. I think that's amazing", "Your friend is indeed extremely entiteled. I hope he have to work hospitality all day, and have some idiot give him shit for doing his job.\n\nNTA, and your friend needs to grow up.", "NTA. You got asked twice whether you wanted more time. You answered no. Meaning you agreed that you were done. So you leave. Your friend sounds rude", "NTA and your friend is exceptionally entitled. In the real world you may or may not get multiple chances to correct yourself.", "NTA\nPeople like your friend are the reason I despise going to Top Golf especially on weekends! You do get to extend your time if you want - and you did. But once you say NO to the next time extension that bay is no longer your bay. I already think Top Golf should limit the amount of \u201cextends\u201d you should be able to do on weekends but your friend makes going to those places such a pain. I\u2019ve had to wait 4 hours for our local TG bc of this exact scenario. Glad you have common sense.", "Yeah, but that's not what the judgement is asking for.\n\nIs OP right that the employee was just doing her job and friend was wrong?  Yes.\n\nTherefore NTA.", "[removed]", "Wait until he finds out that plenty of regular restaurants have time limits as well.", "I didn\u2019t realize it was called Top Restaurant", "[removed]", "\"They're the same picture.\"", "That's a spot on comparison, especially since the alleys near me have the option to rent by the hour as well.", "This is something I was waiting for. One of the main points he was saying was that he thinks the lady just did it the wrong way and picked a random bay even though people were still on it when she should\u2019ve have just picked another, but I told him that it\u2019s probably the system tells her a bay that has run out of time, which essentially means it should be empty, and he said \u201cHow do you know?\u201d, I said common sense but that obviously won\u2019t fly in an argument so how does it work when a employee assigns a bay to a group?", "So that last part, he actually left without complaint and even said thank you when he left. He just brought it up in the car. He also said one of the reasons he was mad the lady came over with the family is that he spilled water and got flustered that she had an employee and family staring him down while his wallet and phone soaked. (Which is true). Still, his points were dumb with it being a restaurant. But he never was actively a dick to the lady, quite the opposite", "Same thought here, he just didn't want anyone challenging him as he whined. I have a friend like this and just let him go because he gets mad if anyone disagrees.", "NTA. You paid for 90 minutes, therefore the space was yours for 90 minutes. I'm surprised they let you keep the space for so long after your time was up and didn't charge you. Once the 90 minutes was up, the space stopped being yours and you are expected to vacate.", "\"They should have asked us to leave and wait a few minutes\"\n\nThey did, that's why the worker came in person. I used to work closing shifts, and when a worker comes and says it's closing time soon or that your reserved time is up soon, then that's when you get ready to leave. \n\nNTA. Your friend is kinda ignorant, but I imagine if/when he starts working for a living that'll change.", "Although I once frequented a bowling alley that made a killer brandy alexander.", "I am an American and I have no idea what Top Golf is. Must not have hit New England yet.", "NTA. Some people just go through life thinking they are more entitled than everyone else. You paid hourly, and even got to knock some balls for a few extra minutes until the next group was ready. People like him will make that place change to kick you as soon as the timer beeps.", ".", "Top Golf and Bowling are the same thing with different gimmicks, neither are restaurants and your friend is an idiot, NTA", "You\u2019re right, your friend does not seem to have any logic.", "Yeah if someone invited me to a place called Top Golf I wouldn't be expecting a meal. Not any more than a coffee and a sandwich anyway", "I'd likely think vending machines at the most, outside of the 19th hole."]}
