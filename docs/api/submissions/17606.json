Now something I never knew was that she had dogs. I only visit her homes when she's at her moms house.  Never visited her dads (theyre divorced.)\n\nApparently her dad and her own a dog, it's a husky.\n\nI don't mind dogs, I don't really care but I am careful around them as dogs can just.. easily eat rabbits.\n\nMy 2 rabbits are quite tiny so pretty open to tragic accidents.\n\nAnywho I dropped off my rabbits at Nina's the other day and right as I was about to drive off, I forgot to pass Nina the bag of rabbit toys. So I head back, now her house is a bit weird as her back yard is the main entrance, well I go in to her back yard and make it to her door but then I see the husky chasing my rabbits. Eventually my rabbits start running and SCREAMING.\n\nIf you've ever heard rabbits scream, you know how  painful and scary it sounds. My blood froze and I literally TACKLED (idk the word for it but not like full on body slam. rather a shove) the dog away from them.\n\nI didn't hurt the dog rather move it to the left, the dog walked into the house and I screamed for Nina.\n\nShe came out and asked wtf im doing here and i told her i forgot to give her rabbit toys and why the hell this dog is chasing my rabbits. She goes onto saying that her husky wouldnt do anything to my rabbits and that they were just playing (yeah the DOG WAS PLAYING not my rabbits.)\n\nI went literally ballistic. Asked her WTF she meant and that my rabbits being scared wasn't funny. She joked and said \"rabbits are food after all\", blood literally boiled. I pay her a LOT of money for pet sitting, at least x2 much as it costs to pet sit here per hour. All because her house is big, full of nature, 'safe', and just good. So for my rabbits to go through this much torture was distraught-ing.\n\nI went home and out of impulse I sent her a petition about like dogs being eaten in a country and that it's needs to stop, and quoted \"Lmao I disagree, dogs might be delicious, dont you think?\" and she was PISSED. I would never eat dogs and it was impulsive but god I was so angry. My rabbits are terrified and currently hiding under the curtains in their room.\n\nApparently Nina did more research on dog eating and found some gore videos and now she is 'traumatized', (dont know how thats my fault) and a few of her cousins messaged me on ig today telling me that while she was wrong, i was petty and that i was worse than her because I made her see blood which she cant tolerate, making her vomit etc.\n\nI shrugged it off but now im thinking, AITA?", "created_utc": 1684450377, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ldjli/aita_for_making_a_statement_about_my_friends_dog/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Find a new trustworthy pet sitter, and lose her as a friend too. She's not one.\n\nCan't rabbits actually die from stress, if I remember correctly. Even if the dog didn't physically harm them, they could have died. Hell, this could have shortened their lives already.\n\nIt is NEVER funny to knowingly cause distress to an animal. The bunnies were SCREAMING, there was no way she didn't know. There's something wrong with her head for thinking that any of that was acceptable.\n\nAlso, huskies have prey drive. Thus, the chasing. She says the dog wouldn't have done anything, but c'mon. Animals are unpredictable, no matter how well you think you know them.\n\nMy rescue dog has a prey drive, and I stopped him every time he tried to chase my cats. It took him mere days to learn to ignore them. Yet I don't leave them in the same space when I leave the house, just in case. You can never be 100% sure.\n\nNTA. I don't think you went too far at all. It's just a fact that dogs are food in some places in the world. It's educational to tell people about it. I don't give a shit about the comment you made. It was obviously said jokingly, just as her comment after her dog almost scared your bunnies to death. At least you never endangered her dog. \n\nIt's so funny to me she would seek out those videos herself and blame you for it, even crying to your mutual friends. What an idiot.", "NTA- my step daughters dog mauled 2 guinea pigs, busted the cage and they had passed before we even got to them. All dogs have a capability. Period.", "NTA you didn't make her see shit she decided to look that up herself. I'm sure she already knew she can't handle blood so why she'd look up something with that risk is beyond me. Sure sending that wasn't really nice but neither was calling your pets food. But also drop her ass she carelessly put your pets in danger and didn't care she did it. The \"my dog wouldn't\" Is lame. Every dog has the capability if or not the owner wants to admit it. It's on her to train her dog and prevent shit like that. Her pure lack of remorse is, gross. Stress is so bad for rabbits I hope your bunnies are doing better now. If this happened now I wonder how well her pet-sitting in the past really went, even if that spot didn't have dogs.", "Yeah NTA. I've heard rabbits scream and yeah no that's not playing. You can't mistake that noise for glee. You didn't make her read more about dog eating either. It's a thing in other countries because they struggle to get enough protein. If she's gonna compare your pets to food then you can compare her pets to food imo.", "NTA.

Pretty good response IMO.", "NTA. I am pretty mad myself! She's clueless AF about animals and obviously about friendship. Let me make this point very clear; if you had not turned back, your bun-buns would have been killed, if not mauled by the dog, they would have died of shock aka a heart attack!", "NTA. Yeah, rabbits ARE food to that dog \u2014 that\u2019s the fucking point. The husky is a predator and the rabbits are prey. They never should have been together, let alone unsupervised. If that had happened to my bunnies when I had them, I would have been furious. Even if the husky didn\u2019t catch up to them, rabbits can still die of fright. \n\nAnd wtf was her reaction anyway? If I were in her shoes and my big dog had almost killed two rabbits I was responsible for, I would\u2019ve been absolutely hysterical. \n\nI hope your bunnies are okay, OP. Keep an eye on them \u2014 I know it isn\u2019t super common, but I read about a bunny who passed away twelve hours after being scared by fireworks. You\u2019re really lucky you got there when you did, tbh. Even if the husky didn\u2019t eat them\u2026like I said, rabbits die of fright. Most rabbits who get caught by predators in the wild die of cardiac arrest, and getting chased by a dog is definitely something that could trigger that.", "NTA. I had rabbits until I developed an allergy. That scream is them fearing for their lives. Also why are they outside unattended? Without the dog or with? I edited out cursing in this comment because this hit my brain in a trauma spot apparently. I had abusive parents and they used dogs and rabbits as punishment a lot. Part of why I was not entirely upset to be too allergic. \n\nRabbits can be scared to death. They're prey animals. This is just abuse. You do need a refund and you do need to consider a relationship with someone who is fine with harming you and your animals.", "No, NTA.\n\nBut, why let another child--who's clearly utterly irresponsible--take care of your prized pets?  Why not just ask an adult, and preferably someone who doesn't have animals themselves that would see your pets as prey?", "NTA.  Sounds like good post for r/pettyrevenge", "NTA\n\nI love dogs but most of them can\u2019t be trusted with rabbits. Rabbits are prey animals and instincts kick in. \n\nYour friend was being careless and ignorant. Don\u2019t ever trust her with a pet of yours again.", "NTA, I don\u2019t know very much about rabbits, but as far as I know, they only scream when they\u2019re in serious danger.  Regardless, Nina was saying cruel things about your rabbits, and you had every right to make a comment back.", "My sister had to rehome her rabbit and it was given to a family who also owned the most boring and phlegmatic dog in the world. They let out the two together in the backyard, and the dog went to \"say hi\" and smell the rabbit... which got so scared that it literally died of heart attack. So yeah, that can also happen, even if the dog is not a hyperactive husky. NTA, your friend is simply cruel. Give your poor bunnies lots of love and pets. <3", "NTA. \"She is traumatized\".
