She was a bridesmaid in my wedding and put a lot of time, energy, and money into throwing showers, bachelorette parties, etc.\n\nWell, now she is engaged and is planning a destination wedding (accommodations and all meals will be paid for). She stated that she does not want any showers, parties, or even gifts because she'd rather people put that towards the plane ticket.\n\nTickets are about $700-1300 roundtrip depending on the airline.\n\nIt's a very small wedding of about 20 people, and we'd all be staying together on a large property for a week.\n\nI am saving to purchase a home in a few years and told my friend that I wouldn't make her wedding, citing two reasons:\n\n1. Finances\n2. The fact that my husband can't attend\n\nI brought these issues up to her and told her I wouldn't make it. She and my other best friend (who is also attending) said they would help in any way they could with the financial part of it.\n\nShe said that the reason my husband was not invited was because of space (I'd be sharing a room with that other best friend) and the fact that she doesn't know him well (her fianc\u00e9 has never met him), and everyone else that will be there is close family. She said even many close family members were not invited because of how small they had to keep it.\n\nShe sent me a relatively upset message, saying that she was disappointed in my decision because she felt she did everything she could to help (money-wise) facilitate my attendance but that I was unwilling to help find a solution.\n\nAITA for saying no to attending my best friend's wedding? \n\nWhile it's nice that accommodations and meals are paid for, I'd still have to find a dress and cover other various expenses along the way.\n\nEDIT:\n\nGuests invited include two groomsmen, two bridesmaids(1 of which is me) and the rest are siblings/ in-laws and her parents.\n\nWhile she didn\u2019t outright offer to pay for half the ticket she offered to help with airline points and help look for cheaper options.

I was initially going to go the other way because destination weddings are often selfish, \"pay your own way\" setups,  but I think you're the selfish one here. They didn't invite close family so you could have a spot, are paying for everything over there and are offering financial help with your ticket and you're whining about a dress, after this friend dropped everything to be a bridesmaid at your wedding.  You need to figure out what feelings are lying underneath this, because I see some jealousy peeking through", "This is such an obvious YTA that I can only assume it\u2019s the best friend writing from her crappy friend\u2019s POV. Your *best* friend put significant time, energy and money into your wedding and you can\u2019t be bothered to do a tiny fraction of the same for her. If you\u2019re still interested in having a best friend, you need to get over yourself and show up at this wedding.\n\nAnd just to add, it\u2019s totally reasonable that your spouse isn\u2019t invited to a 20-person wedding. They are probably excluding many people much closer to them than your spouse. Deal with it.", "YTA. \n\nI question how good a friend this person is if you\u2019re *this* adamant about not attending her wedding. The big expenses are being taken care of for you & a dress doesn\u2019t have to be at all expensive - that\u2019s you making an excuse. Your friend has done a lot for you & you seem to be willing to do zero & find a way out of this all together. Fine, in that it is your choice, but would I consider you a good friend? Probably not\u2026", "YTA\n\nWhile you can choose what you spend your money on, it honestly seems like you're grasping at straws for reasons not to go. They said they would help with money and that they only want you there. You must not care for your friend very much, because I would be devastated if I were the bride, having been there and done so much for you and getting absolutely nothing in return, not even your presence.", "YTA\n\nYou accepted that she do so much for yours - now you won't do the comparable for her? Bc your husband can't go? I mean even the financial aspect isn't fair if you accepted it and she is taking care of the most significant costs. \n\nLike I would do so much to be at my best friend's wedding... and I have... it's crazy to me that a tiny amount towards a house is your reason. It's not an amount delaying by much at all.", "YTA. You don't WANT to go to her wedding when she did so much for yours. You can go without your husband, your husband is not you and you can do things without him.\n\nWhy don't you want to spend some money on your best friend's wedding ? Does she mean that little to you ?", "YTA in my opinion. The amount of the trip is negligible when it comes to saving for a house. That $700- $1300 is not what's going to stand between you and a house. If it were that crucial you could literally make other everyday sacrifices if it meant that much to be with your \"best friend\".\n\nYou can also do without your husband for a few days and quite frankly him not being able to go actually works in your favor when it comes to finances because that's one less person you'll have to pay for.  Your husband being invited would double your budget. Your decision to not go is really messed up considering you call her incredible and how much time, energy, and money she put into your wedding. You're being so selfish with this decision.", "YTA - I'm sorry, *what exactly* is your problem?\n\nYou can't sleep away from Mister Fantastic for a week to celebrate your bestie's once in a lifetime experience? It's only 1200 or less with their help, definitely worth it for a WEEK of vacation and adventure. \n\nYour husband? **SO WHAT?!?!?** why is he supposed to have to go?\n\nBecause why? Because you're waaa lonely? wtaf?\n\nIs your husband maybe a controlling spouse and won't allow you to go and has convinced you this is a good reason?\n\nBecause it isn't, **YTA.**", "YTA You\u2019re just making up excuses at this point.

Would you have been willing to attend a bachelorette party without your husband?  Would you ever go on a \"girls' trip\" without your husband?\n\nYour friend has been very generous in planning this, and wants nothing other than you buying a plane ticket and showing up, and friends are willing to help you finance it the plane ticket.  It's a little weird to invite people without their spouse, but this is a special case of a very tiny wedding.  You were one of the very few people she wants at her wedding. Wear a dress you already have, borrow one, or pick one up from a consignment shop, and give your dear friend this gift.\n\nNAH but I think you will regret tanking your friendship over this.

You aren't attached at the hip right? Aren't you allowed to do things on your own?\n\nIf you are financially unable to make the trip, you're not obligated to go into debt.\n\nHowever citing financial reason when youre able to pay for it and are even helped out financially, will communicate to your friend that you don't consider her the same as she does you.", "YTA, it\u2019s very uncommon for your meals and accommodations to be paid for. It does stink that your husband can\u2019t go, but it seems like you have another best friend that\u2019s gonna be traveling with you.", ">She was a bridesmaid in my wedding and put a lot of time, energy, and money into throwing showers, bachelorette parties, etc.\n\n>Well, now she is engaged and is planning a destination wedding (accommodations and all meals will be paid for). She stated that she does not want any showers, parties, or even gifts because she'd rather people put that towards the plane ticket.\n\nI'm assuming if she were getting married locally, you'd have played the role for her that she did for you at your wedding. How much time, energy, and money would you have been investing in throwing showers and parties, plus gifts? My back of the envelope calculations if it were me are something like a couple hundred for each party and maybe a hundred for the wedding gift; so for me, I'd be thinking around $500. Your estimates may be very different.\n\n>Tickets are about $700-1300 roundtrip depending on the airline.\n\nWhat's the actual difference in spend between your estimates for a local wedding and the tickets plus sundry other expenses? What would that amount have gone down to with the extra financial support the bride and your other friend offered?\n\nIs that amount ***really*** going to impair your ability to buy a house \"in a few years\"?\n\nThe dress is a wash as you'd need it wherever the wedding. \n\nI'm not fully buying the \"but I can't take my husband\" thing, I think you've tacked that on to have more reasons. You're an adult and you can have fun with your best friends without him.\n\nFrom my perspective, the real issue would be the time off from work you'd need to have to attend a destination wedding - but you haven't mentioned that at all.\n\nI'm torn about judgement because this is the only destination wedding I've come across where I didn't think the wedding couple was the AH. In this case, I'm kind of thinking you are, even though generally I don't think anyone has an obligation to go to a wedding. This isn't an acquaintance or a work colleague. This is your best friend of 10 years. \n\nArgh. I'm gonna go with YTA. What tipped me from N. A. H. is that I think your friend is right that she and your other friend are trying to find solutions for you and you're not willing to try. Again, this is your best friend who gave a whole lot to you for your wedding.", "YTA, I am going to my best friend's wedding in November alone due to finances and my husband is gonna stay back. That's your best friend, how can u skip her wedding. It is okay to attend wedding without your spouse. Grow up a little?", "She was a bridesmaid at your wedding but doesn\u2019t know your husband well! Fuck off and go cry to someone else. I wouldn\u2019t go either.", "I will probably be in the minority here, but I really think you should bust your ass to go.   I won\u2019t say that youll be an AH if you don\u2019t, just that this will become one of your major life regrets.", "YTA Did you compensate your friend then for the expenses she incurred when planning your wedding? I know with all certainty it would have cost at least what you quoted and likely more. You have years to compensate for the money you might be out but you\u2019ll never get the years back you\u2019ll miss your friend", "YTA. This might get down voted, but after your friend spent lots on your wedding, I think it's a reasonable request from her.", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s one of the most important days of her life and you\u2019re her best friend. She went all out for your wedding and you are refusing to even attend hers. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the fact she didn\u2019t invite your husband that she barely knows to share in her small celebration with her favorite people. Friends are not suddenly required to invite your spouse everywhere just because you got married. \n\n\u201cI want to purchase a home in a few years\u2026\u201d\n\n$700 will stop you from doing that? \n\n\u201cI have to find a dress\u201d\n\nMercari, thrift stores, Poshmark, Rent The Runway - all inexpensive options. \n\nYou know at least 3 people there, you *have* to have one more and suddenly it\u2019s comfortable? \n\nShe\u2019s right. She bent over backwards and is spending a ton of money so you can be there - and you\u2019re finding every excuse that you can not to go.", "Tough one. \n\nIf you were currently in the process of buying a new home or in serious financial trouble, this would be a no brainer. But you seem to be doing fine and the house is still theoretical.\n\nThis is your best friend who wants you to be there with her on her special day. She is taking care of your accommodations and will even help with your flight. She isn't making any additional demands regarding gifts or parties or fancy dresses. She just wants YOU. \n\nIt is weird that your husband isn't invited, but since it is limited to 20 people and she is footing the bill for accommodations, I get it.\n\nYou wouldn't necessarily be the AH for not going. If you have a destination wedding I think that you need to expect that some people won't be able to attend. But there isn't anything really stopping you. It is inconvenient, but totally manageable.\n\nNAH, but I think that you should go if you really care about this friendship.", "I mean\u2026 you aren\u2019t an asshole\u2026 but you also can\u2019t assume your friendship won\u2019t take a hit because of this. As you said, she went above and beyond to support you. You are choosing not to accompany her for her very small wedding. She clearly greatly values your friendship. \nConsider how much this person means to you now, and how much you suspect they will mean to you in the future. How will you feel in 5 years time if she stops putting in effort into the relationship and your friendship is strained, or gone? \nI\u2019m not saying that will happen. I am saying it\u2019s a possibility. If you don\u2019t go to her wedding, ensure you do something to show how much you value her being in your life and her friendship.", "Well since you\u2019re not going she can invite those other close family members.", "I had a destination wedding and had zero expectations of anyone, except my immediate family (and I helped with $$ if they needed it.). Otherwise, it was my choice to get married in a far away place, so I accepted the consequences. \n\n\u2026but another thought - weddings are expensive and she spent a lot on yours. It doesn\u2019t sound like your reasoning is sincere - how much more is this really, with food, no gifts, shower\u2026which she spent on you.", "As others have said, YTA. She can\u2019t be that good a friend if you\u2019re not willing to take the time to go to her wedding. Finances don\u2019t sound to be an issue since she offered to help pay and you\u2019re saving for a house \u201cin a few years.\u201d So she\u2019s not worth waiting an extra month or two several years down the line to buy a house? The like $500-$1000 you might spend today isn\u2019t going to make or break you buying a house 3-4 years from now.  \n\nAlso your husband not being invited sometimes can be a big deal, but not when it\u2019s like 20 people total going to the wedding. There\u2019s no real excuse other than you just not being that good a friend to her.", "NTA.\n\nI always thought the purpose of doing a destination wedding was to ensure most people declined the invitation.", "YTA and a really shitty friend. They have removed so many of the barriers in your attendance and you are unwilling to make any sacrifices for your best friend on a very important occasion for her.

So shes your bestie when its time for her to pay everything for you on your day.

Or do you like how she pays for everything when you want her to?", "NTA. \n  \nIn my world if my husband doesn't get invited to a week long vacation then I don't go. Ridicules for your friend to even think that is acceptable.", "YTA. \n\nNormally I\u2019d say this is reasonable but she\u2019s going above and beyond to make it possible and affordable for you to come.", "YTA. Your friend jumped through hoops for you, bent over backwardsfor  you, spent time AND money on your wedding and you're not willing to reciprocate? Seriously the amount of money you're talking about is going to delay your house purchase plan by like what a month? Let's be realistic here, this friendship is one-sided and you're making this about you.", "YTA you are one of those that won\u2019t go places without your husband \ud83d\ude44  Way to show your friend how much you value her friendship. Buying in a few YEARS? you aren\u2019t anywhere near closing costs where finances are untouchable jeopardizing your loan\u2026 and they offered to help\u2026 are you being obtuse on purpose? Of course she\u2019s upset\u2026 she cut family and included YOU- the one with a one-sided friendship. Your friendship won\u2019t survive you not attending, the resentment will always be there because it\u2019s clear your husband is the reason.", "My judgement depends on whether to look at it from the angle of \"best friend\" standards or more general standards.\n\nIn the bigger picture, no assholes. Clearly this friendship has run its course l, and despite your talk about best friends you aren't behaving like one. There's a difference here in how the two of you see friendship: she invested a lot of effort in your wedding and counts you among the 20 closest people that she wants to share her special celebration with. You find the social convention of inviting your husband more important than her big day. That's your right, and of course she's bound to be disappointed. You're behaving like an ok-friend and she's behaving like a close best friend. Things change. \n\nClearly though if the standard here is how best friends behave to each other, YTA.

Once upon a time the bride's family paid for the wedding and bridal party and the groom's family paid for the honeymoon and groomsmen. At the end of it all it was split equally among families. I have never actually been married but the one time I got far enough into planning my self and ex planned to pay for all of it ourselves. No bachelor/Bachelorette parties but the wedding itself. We planned to pay for all accommodations plus attire for both parties and the reception. I can't understand someone hosting a party/event this outlandish and expecting everyone to be able to afford it.

It is fine to have a one day wedding with no partners invited.  But a week long destination wedding?  Fuck off.  That is worth three bachlorette parties.  It is way too much to ask.

In other words, it doesn't make sense.", "YTA I presume you would not have gone if the wedding was in your home town either?

And even if she doesn't know your husband that well, you're her best friend, and he's your husband - he should be invited. OTOH, it also sounds like she's being *extremely* generous in her provisions for all her guests, and like she's basically willing to pay/bribe you to come by helping with airfare. She also put a ton of energy, time, and money into celebrating with you when you got married, and you don't seem remotely motivated to reciprocate. Honestly, OP, it sounds like you just don't want to go (you're griping about needing to buy a dress, for your best friend's wedding? really?).

GIRL - seriously, she invited ONLY 20 people, offered to mitigate costs for YOU, you have accommodations paid for, the only thing you'd be missing is your spouse? Did you pay for your besties dress, offer her accommodations, and would you ever pay for her to attend say your baby shower?! Sounds like you wouldn't.  In the grand scheme of things, unless you work a minimum wage job, 700-1200 for a plane ticket to somewhere is NOT going to make all that big of a difference when saving for a house. \n\nIf you (or your husband) are really that upset about him not being invited, why not encourage him to go on a boys trip that week? Or take some time off and send him a spa or something. You will not simply perish for not being around each other for one week. I have not been with my husband for 6/9 months this year. But that's life. \n\nBe a better friend.", "I actually had a similar situation happen.  A close friend of the family's son was getting married on the opposite end of the country.  We assumed familial titles.  We were all invited.  We refused to go; it was unaffordable (they weren't even offering help).  My dad was cool with just my mom going, but she didn't want to.  So we RSVP'd no.  The friendship never recovered though we did send a gift.\n\nPoint being, it kind of sucks.  Destination weddings are very costly; not a lot of people can attend those.  You accept that you can't go, and she knows upfront the reasons/can invite someone else.  In your case you cannot afford a big expense like that.  While she does have every right to be upset, she should understand; you're NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour friend has violated one of the most important rules of wedding etiquette, one that very rarely gets an exception: married couples are a package deal.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPeople who plan destination weddings, even those who offer to foot most of the costs, need to accept that some folks are going to say no.  She can save her pouting for something ACTUALLY important.", "Going against the grain here it seems, NTA. Destination weddings are expensive, take a lot of time, and can be extremely stressful. No one should be guilted into a destination wedding. I am so sick of people choosing to travel and then getting pissy when others can't or don't want to.", "NTA. I had a destination wedding myself, so I get it. I was actually on your friend\u2019s side with this one until you said your SPOUSE is not invited??!

OP is just trying to find reasons not to go, over solutions to go.", "Thanks!", "Ya I agree too. It could be geographic. I had a VERY SMALL wedding (25) and had to pay for each person to ride an aerial tramway to reach to mountaintop venue. One of my hubby\u2019s best friends/best men I met day of and he paid for and brought his new wife and baby daughter from Hawaii. I live in Palm Springs, CA. I never said they couldn\u2019t come, only that they would have to figure out how to get there. Once there, I paid for everyone\u2019s admission and food, alcohol, etc. so *shrug* maybe she just doesn\u2019t want to go? Or the husband just doesn\u2019t want to go?", "No, that\u2019s true. But again, in my case, my friend was able to step outside of herself and say \u201c8 people\u2026if my husband goes, who does Biscuit cut?  Her sister?  Her new husband\u2019s brother?  Maybe her her FIL or MIL. Sounds like I should cut Biscuit some slack here\u201d. Shit, she was our *officiant*. Her husband came and just stayed in his hotel room and enjoyed the city. He even brought he something last minute to her. and told us we looked great. **HE** was more gracious than OP. \n\nSame here. There are 20 damn guests. We gotta assume 4 off the bat are parents. Another 4 or 5 are siblings and spouses. Any kids? Right here we\u2019ve got 10 people JUST FOR IMMEDIATE FAMILY. You now get 10 invites for your friends. 5 each if you have different sets of friends. Someone is gonna have an off number. \n\nITS NICE TO BE GRACIOUS TO YOUR BFF WHO LIKELY HAS ~5 INVITES TO DOLE OUT TO HER FRIENDS AND, SADLY, CANT ACCOMMODATE YOUR HUSBAND **BUT** WILL BE PAYING FOR **YOU** TO GO BECAUSE YOU MEAN SO MUCH TO HER.", "I mean, if you have a 150 person wedding and you can\u2019t invite 151, sure. But a 20 person wedding isn\u2019t about expense. It\u2019s deliberate. Likely because of the venue.", "I live 3 hours away from my friends and if one of them is having a party my husband will either stay home with the pets or meet up with his Uni friends whilst we are there. So most of my friends spouses may only have met him once or twice in the 15years we've been together. Plus it's unusual for us to do things as couples anyway. The only ones that have met him more than that are the ones that use our drive for airport parking!", "A friend of mine is allergic to seafood. When she used to travel a lot, her hubby & I would happily stuff ourselves on sushi.", "My husband recently met one of my closest friends husband. They got married in 2019, had been together since 2017 and we've been together 15years. We just don't tend to do things with our other halves and I live in a different country a 3hour away. I don't see it as unusual.  Of my friends of 30 years I know things about their husbands and could pick them out of a line up but we certainly aren't friends. If I printed pics and said match them to my friends he would struggle!", "Oh it is. But it's one of the few employment places in my area where I can get PTO and not have to be a general manager", "This is an AITA where Reddit's leaning young and single resulted in a really bad judgement.", "So NA. You don't have the Money, and accepting Financial help is not easy. At least I could never and i would feel Bad for it.  Second without the Husband is just weird for some. I would not want to go without my Partner either. \n\nWhy not finding a compromise and have a small group Party later with really close people? problem solved.", "Nah not TA.\nHonestly, expecting people to spend so much money and travel that far just to see them get married is ridiculous..\nJust my opinion\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Here\u2019s the viewpoint of an older woman:  you\u2019re not the asshole but neither is your friend.  People, especially friends, grow apart.  Maybe you and she aren\u2019t at the same level of friendship since you got married.   Why has her fianc\u00e9 never met your husband?  Do you still socialize with her, just not include the guys?\n\nNo one should ever feel obligated to travel to an event.  EVER.  She\u2019s asking you to give up a week of your life.  Would you have to take off work?  Would you resent that later?  \n\nAnd destination weddings are stupid.  Even if the entire thing is paid for, there are always order considerations:  pet sitters, house sitters, missed work, other obligations that have to be missed or rescheduled.  It\u2019s just a very big ask and it\u2019s stupid.", "I will never understand why brides think their idea of a \u201cperfect day\u201d translates into a universal desire?", "It's actually an enormous etiquette breach that your friend didn't invite your husband. You don't invite one half of a married couple to a wedding. Ever. Both or none. Those are the options.\n\nHad she invited your husband, maybe you and he would have seen your way clear to consider this your \"vacation\" in advance of buying your home. \n\nNTA.", "NTA - once your married you are a couple, life is a team sport. My wife is invited but I\u2019m not, we will never be seeing you again. You won\u2019t be coming over to get any free drinks.", "NTA, these people saying that you are seem to be entitled assholes.", "Also, why the idea that one has to buy A New Dress for $$$?  If best friends then your bestie will love to see you there in a dress you have worn before.  Be brave!  Go, have a lovely time.", "Good job reading the post all the way, oh wait you didn\u2019t", "She\u2019s a cheapskate and a truly shitty friend. This is a bummer of a post from a selfish person, who can\u2019t even reciprocate for her bridesmaid. OP is a definite AH and she should edit her post to say her former best friend.", "I've had to learn this lesson over and over again. Some people just take advantage of kindness. \n\nI helped someone I considered my bestfriend move from a northern state to a southern one. I was there far longer than was planned, which left my family in a rough situation(I had a 1 year old at the time) She was supposed to ride with me in the moving van, but I ended up spending 16 hours with her husband lol \n\nBut the point is, when I needed her help moving just 3 hours away(when she only lived about 45 minutes from our old house. Plus I just wanted her help with packing since I had a baby and I had packed most of their apartment for her) she said the 45 minutes there and back was too far. That was literally her excuse. I honestly cried because I felt so betrayed and used. I considered her my bestfriend. \n\nIt's shitty man, go to your best friends wedding for flippen sake. Don't let her down when she needs you.", "Right. I wouldn't use a week of my precious vacation time to attend a wedding my husband wasn't invited to. While I find it rude that BFF invite OP without her husband, I believe OP needs to accept it; it's her wedding, her choice. In turn, she needs to understand that OP doesn't want to attend solo; her time-off, her choice. NTA", "This is true. I do this for some work trips for example. Just pay for my husband\u2019s flights as everything else is covered by the employer", "If it was my wife in this situation I would make sure she went because it\u2019s her friend.", "Unless her husband is throw8ng a fit about not being able to go.", "Small weddings are fine but nobody is obligated to attend.", "Possible. I\u2019m not agreeing with the first commenter. I\u2019m just suggesting op could just go the spiteful route and I wouldn\u2019t blame her.", "It reads to me like OP just doesn't want to attend/spend the money, is using 'saving for a house' as an excuse, and won't accept the financial help because they don't actually need it.", "Even disregarding the financial issues, I don't get why OP's husband has to be invited...?  \n\nThere might be some circumstances where I could understand one partner can't remain home alone, but OP is 25, doesn't have kids & there're no other reasons mentioned. Is it just that OP wants to cling?", "Omg I hadn\u2019t even thought of that. HUGE YTA, OP. Which is it? You don\u2019t want to go because your man can\u2019t? Or you don\u2019t want to go because y\u2019all can\u2019t afford it? Either way\u2014you don\u2019t want to go."]}
