{"id": 1868, "submission_id": "yqdnfg", "title": "AITA for refusing to sleep with my husband?", "selftext": "So I (26F) and my husband (30M) have been together for 4 years. Generally, most things have been great. We're very much in love. \n\nHowever, the last couple of months I've been getting aggravated and sleep deprived because he has been taking up most of the bed. At some point last year, he decided that he needed 10 extra pillows around his body for maximum comfort. This left me with about 2\u00bd feet of space to sleep and I'm left dangling off the edge of our bed most nights. I tend to sleep near the edge of the bed anyway, so no biggie. But then he started encroaching more. \n\nAt first, he'd lie directly in the middle of the bed with pillows surrounding him. It was tolerable. But a couple of months ago, he decided along with the pillows, he NEEDS to have his leg and elbow across me. I've effectively become one of his pillows and he's basically sleeping on top of me. I've recently started developing back pain and I'm pretty sure it's from him over encumbering by spine with his body weight.\n\nI've told him to stop putting his leg on me and to scoot over. I've mentioned several times that I'm starting to have back pain. But every night I have to fend off him wrapping himself over me and push him over. \n\nHe says he can't help it, and I know he probably can't because he is completely mentally incoherent when he's mid sleep. But I'm sick of it. So I've started sleeping in the guest bedroom. He has told me it makes him sad when he wakes up and I'm not there, and he doesn't want to go to sleep alone. I explained that he leaves me with so little room at this point, I have to choose between falling off the bed or having my spine crushed during the night. He said he can't control it, and that he's unconscious when he crushes me. I told him I don't care if waking up to an empty bed makes him sad, and I don't care that he can't control what he does while sleeping. I can't sleep in my own bed anymore without experiencing physical pain and that upsets me. He didn't say a word and just walked into the room to sleep. After this conversation, I felt bad and tried sleeping with him again. It's 3 am now and I'm writing this post because after shoving his leg off the middle of my back 4 times I have given up. \n\nI feel terrible that I disregarded his emotions and I feel there may be a solution to this issue I may not be seeing. Did I handle this situation thw wrong way? Am I a big jerk?", "created_utc": 1667986035, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqdnfg/aita_for_refusing_to_sleep_with_my_husband/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What kind of selfish man are you married to? Kick him and his pillows into the guest room. Eesh.", "NTA. I see no reason why his emotions are more important than your sleep.", "NTA, this man has zero regard for your comfort, why should you worry about his emotional response to the situation he alone is the architect of?", "NTA. Your husband sounds like the most high-maintenance person on earth. You have to think of your own health over him not waking up with you. It\u2019s laughable that this is even an issue. I would tell him he can get rid of half the pillows and keep his weight off of you or sleep alone. Then, I would have him sleep in the guest bedroom at least half of the time.", "Why the Hell does he need 10 extra pillows for his \"maximum comfort\"? Does he have health issues? Does he need a bumper so that he doesn't fall off the bed accidentally? Even with a king sized bed, that's ridiculous. My suggestion is to have a snuggle session before he builds his pillow fort and then go to \"your\" bed for a night of blissful,  spread-eagled sleep. NTA.", "Yikes! Sorry. Can't see a solution either. Maybe other redditors will have one. What I do know though is that you're NTA in any way. Hubby is not an a-hole for feeling bad about sleeping alone or wanting to sleep with you. But he is TA for not seeing your side of the story and not being empathetic to your needs. He seems to be only focused on his need to have you there and is disregarding your pain and discomfort.\n\nEdit: I'd suggest you keep sleeping in the guest room, even as you BOTH try to come up with a solution. This is a problem affecting the two of you. It should be solved by the two of you. Giving in like you have now is not a solution.\n\nEdit 2: Also 10 pillows?!?", "NTA if it wasn't obvious already\nThe fact that he doesn't intend to make your nights insufferable or that he can't help it doesn't make the problem disappear : of course you're allowed to ask for decent night's \n\nFirst he need to understand that if you sleep alone it's not because you reject him. Sleeping is a fundamental need and if sleeping next to him makes it difficult for you to sleep, then yeah you need to take actions about it. How would he feel if eating next to you meant he had to starve every time ? Chances are that he'll quickly have to eat alone to solve the issue\n\nHe might have some affective-related issues that need to be addressed. His need to be litteraly buried under pillows and you to sleep may be a sign of something bigger going on for him. I'm not an expert, just throwing the idea out. \n\nAnyway, you can't sacrifice your sleep just so that he's not \"sad when you're not there in the morning\" : that's understandable, but unreasonable. He must find a way to either deal with the fact that you'll sleep without him, or find a way to not crush your spine", "NTA\n\nYour husband needs to understand that while he might be asleep, he\u2019s hurting you and ruining your sleep. Perhaps if he didn\u2019t have an extra TEN!!! Pillows he wouldn\u2019t be wrapping himself round you. The pillows alone show he\u2019s more bothered about his own comfort than yours.\n\nIf he can\u2019t sleep like a regular person, with a couple of pillows, he needs to understand you will be in the other room, as your sleep quality and comfort is just as important as his.", "Am I reading this right??\n\nYou feel terrible you disregarded his emotions but he has:\n\n1. Singlehandedly pushed you out of your own bed. \n2. Disregarded and made light of the pain he caused you. Unknowningly or not doesn't matter. \n3. Ignored your complaints. \n\nThe self entitlement is off the charts with this dude. Why is his sleep and comfort at night more important than yours?!?\n\nWake up, OP.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. If he cared he would offer to sleep in the spare room. He doesn't seem to care about your discomfort even when he's awake. He can control the amount of pillows and sleeping in the middle of the bed to start with. Don't feel guilty as he doesn't seem to feel any guilt about causing you discomfort. He sounds selfish", "NTA\n\n\nHe doesn't care about your needs or your comfort.\n\n\nHe can control having 10 pillows. He could ask you to wake him up as soon as he lays on you. \n\n\nHis comfort is more important than you being in pain. \n\n\nI would've found harsher words to be honest.", "NTA - This is a difficult situation. One option would be a bigger bed. Another option could be two smaller beds in the same room. Independently, you deserve a good night\u2019s sleep too.", "NTA I would say. Even if he can't control it he can't demand you to go so much out of your way that you are in physical pain. I don't know if this is an option in your country but where I life there are sleep labs that monitor you during sleep and can diagnose possible problems and help you or more like your husband to have a more calm sleep", "NTA. He didn\u2019t really leave you with any other choice.", "EGH! so NTA i'm so bloody sick of sleepers that do this. ITs not okay to be so selfish when you share a bed.  Don't set yourself on fire to keep him warm", "NTA You feel bad, but did you notice that your husband doesn't feel bad at all? You're sleep deprived and hurting and all he cares about is himself.", "NTA. \n\nWould it be an alternative to buy two single beds with a little space between them? You would sleep in the same room, close to eath other, but have the whole bed for yourself.", "NTA. He's being unreasonable. You should be able to sleep comfortably.", "NTA But does your SO do any form of exercise? If not maybe you should encourage him to do some. I stopped wriggling in bed once I took up BJJ purely because most nights it hut to much to move.", "NTA. A little harsh maybe, but it is your bed too and you deserve space in it. Maybe fully wake him up to move every time? A bigger bed? A sword?", "Tell him it's the pillows or you , and get the biggest bed you can , also your pain is greater than him feeling sad that you are not there", "NTA. You have valid reasons for not wanting to sleep in the same bed with him. No matter how sad it makes him, his emotional pain is nothing against the physical pain he is causing you.", "NTA. Whilst he can't control what he does in his sleep, he CAN control what he does *before* he goes to sleep. Having an excessive number of pillows and lying in the centre of the bed show complete disregard for your comfort. \n\nIn short, he's being selfish when he's awake.", ">We're very much in love.\n\nAre you sure? Because nothing you've written in your post indicates he loves you, or even likes you, more than as a prop to make him feel good", "Set up a video camera to record you both in bed for an entire night. Then show him exactly what you\u2019re dealing with every night. Maybe if he\u2019s confronted with actual visual evidence he will start to understand.  NTA", "NTA He disregarded your feelings also so why are you feeling bad because he is sad? If he wants to see you in the morning either get two beds in one room or he can get up and go see you in another room.", "NTA\nThrow his pillows 9n the floor and scoot him. If her don't like it he can find someone who will tolerate this nonsense.\nWhat he's saying is his comfort is more important than yours but he doesn't want u to find comfort elsewhere..at least u have a guest bedroom. \nI'm stuck sleeping in a toddler bed due to mine.", "NTA. To my mind, physical needs trump feelings. You need to sleep. He feels bad. Your sleep is more important so he needs to suck it up. He can ask for more snuggle time on the sofa, or more touching/comfort in the daytime. But he can't ask for you to not sleep. You need that and it can't be met any other way.", "I had the same problem as your husband OP the way my former partner ended up correcting this was to just wake me up every time I ended up with arm or leg on her. Anytime you are discomforted whilst trying to sleep just wake him up. My body quickly learnt hey don\u2019t do that we need sleep", "NTA although maybe the wrong choice of words saying you don't care about his feelings on his face I harsh. Maybe try to buy a bigger bed if you can afford it. Talk to him while showing care you can also try a little bit of showing what you're going through by behaving the same way hitting him while making it look like you're sleeping or some other inappropriate behavior to make him understand your suffering", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re not a jerk. NTA.\n\nEither carry on sleeping in the guest room or every time you wake up you wake him up.

Nah he needs some kinda therapy.\n\nNTA", "My god these types of men that have so little empathy for other people, the only way he cares that you\u2019re not getting rest or that you\u2019re in pain is when it directly impacts him (he\u2019s a little sad when he wakes up?)\n\nAbsolutely NTA. And if he\u2019s the kind of person that only consequences (discomfort) he feels make any difference (cause he doesn\u2019t feel your distress and pain) then your only avenue is to make him feel the consequences. He says he can\u2019t do anything about it but he could not take 45 pillows to bed to start.\n\nSide bar I had an ex (who is a very lovely guy broke up for life reasons) who\u2019d fling around in bed at night while asleep when we first started dating and hit me a few times with his limbs. It hurt. One left me with an egg on my skull. We talked about it but what could he do cause he\u2019s asleep. Next time he did it I whacked him just as hard back. Only took one time and it stopped. \n\nHe fucks up your sleep, you fuck his right back. He\u2019ll learn.", "NTA. it's perfectly okay to have separate sleeping spaces I think there's various reasons as to why people do it, sleep is important if you aren't getting any because of them, you aren't doing anything wrong sleeping in a bed where you won't wake up hurting the next day!", "NTA. Do you have a guestroom? Go to the guestroom. Sleeping in the same bed is not a requirement for a good marriage.", "NTA but a little insensitive when you said you don't care.\n\ni thought this would be about him asking for sex but it's just about sleeping habits that he can't control. you both should have talked about what things you can do about it instead going off on him telling you don't care. no other words could be any more hurtful than hearing \"i don't care\" from your loved ones.", "Hmmm this is a tough one. If he really can't help what he does in his sleep than he's not really TA either. I have night terrors and constantly move around when I do, which I know can be irritating, and I need an extra pillow between my knees for back issues that I have. But I can't really control these things, and it sucks knowing that I may be irritating my partner. However, if he really needs tons of pillows than that's kind of over doing it, and something that he actually can control. \n\nThe only suggestion I'd have is getting a bigger sized bed. But also I don't think sleeping in seperate beds is a bad thing, though it often has a bad reputation. Maybe just tell him that you still love him and you do want to sleep next to him but it's giving you bad problems and lack of sleep, which is a pretty serious situation.", "I can empathize with the husband as I have a bit of sleep anxiety. I use a pregnancy / U-shaped pillow and a weighted blanket. The pillow contains me from taking over the whole bed and makes me feel secure and the weighted blanket calms me like a swaddle. Huh. I guess I basically need to be in a womb to sleep comfortably \ud83e\udd14. \n\nAnyway - OP maybe try those things with your husband. Otherwise, yeah, absolutely NTA for sleeping in the guest room.", ">Can't see a solution either\n\nHave you tried different blankets? The seperation may help him sleep better too.", "> How would he feel if eating next to you meant he had to starve every time ?\n\nExcellent analogy.   \n\n\nYour husband is somehow failing to grasp that his sleep is destroying your sleep. I am not sure why this is so hard for him, but he doesn't get it.   \n\n\nYour options are  \n1)  to enjoy your blissful sleep in the guest room (invest in a new mattress and make it super comfy for you!)   \n2) to show him exactly how bad it is for you. So every time you wake up or have trouble getting to sleep,  you wake him up and tell him you can't sleep and ask him to move so you can sleep. Every single time.  So he also gets to wake up multiple times a night. This honestly seems very silly as you have a guest room. But it is also possible he will come up with some other solution (two beds in same room, king bed, bumper pillows, etc.) By making this a problem for him instead of just for you, he may be motivated to solve it.", "NTA\n\nI was about to comment this as a separate bed in the room means you get to sleep peacefully & he gets to see you when he goes to sleep/wakes up", "Harsh? O.o \n\n\nHe demands to have 10 pillows with no regard to her comfort. Even as she tells him she is in literal pain, his comfort is more im portant.", "Sorry I get really ragey about sleep. It\u2019s the rug that ties my whole room/life together \ud83d\ude02", "He has effectively said he doesn't care either. He'll feel bad. He can't help it so no offer to try to solve the problem. It's like tough luck, OP, deal with it.", "He doesn't care.  Why should OP?", "But he is a man remember. Obviously more important than his wife. I'm being sarcastic of course.", "This. \n\n\nOh, you are in discomfort for months? Well, I'm more comfortable with 10 pillows as with 5 and that is clearly more important.\n\n\nOh, I claim even more space and you are in literal pain? But leaving to another bed limits my comfort. The important thing.", "Came here to say this.\n\nAll about his comfort. Not a single word for OP's comfort or most important -> OP's health."]}
