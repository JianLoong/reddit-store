I also make sure to keep a calendar of birthdays for my family/friends and for my in laws so I can remind my husband to get a card or for us to bring cake to his siblings' places.\n\nThe problem is that my husband hates birthdays. Though he never refutes his own party, he tends to moan and groan about the hassle of \"getting a card\" and \"spending money of gifts\" for our boys and other family members.\n\nAt first this really bothered me because I took it as \"he doesn't care to celebrate out lives.\" But I reminded myself that he does a lot for me and the people he loves, so maybe it's just not his thing. He's also lackluster on Christmas, so what ever. \n\nThis leads into the 12th. It was my birthday, and I got this beautiful cake done for myself from a baker. I snuck it into the house and had a piece while the boys were at school and my husband was at work, then stuck it in the freezer in the garage so that I could pick away at it, completely in secret from the rest of the family. I figured that if they wanted to celebrate my b-day with me, they would get me a cake themselves. I shouldn't have to throw my own party for their benefit.\n\nWell today my husband found the cake and asked about it. I told him that it was for my b-day, and he said \"but there's already a piece missing.\"\n\n I explained that no, it was my birthday on Friday and I got myself a cake to celebrate. \n\nHe then asks me \"well when were you gonna share it with us?\"\n\nTo which I told him never...because it's my cake. If he wanted to have a cake with me, he could have gotten me one on my birthday.\n\nHe then exclaims \"So you're just gonna eat a whole cake?\"\n\nAnd I tell him yes, yes I will, because it's my cake and I can take as long as I want to go through it.\n\nHe told me that this was greedy and that he thinks its unreasonable for me to eat an ENTIRE cake myself. He even told our oldest about it, and my oldest laughed and said \"honestly I'd do the same thing.\"\n\nIdk, I could be the asshole for being greedy and I guess no one should eat an entire cake for themselves...But it's not like I had it all at once, I only had one piece and will take my time getting through the rest.

You're ***SO*** into birthdays that you take it as a slight that your husband don't care about them (I'm the exact same way as your husband, except I refuse parties, and ask to be left alone, and often just get myself a hotel room to basically just relax and have some peace and quiet; my wife ***LOVES*** birthdays, so we make a huge fuss on hers and our daughter's).\n2. You're ***SO*** bent out of shape by the \"asymmetry\" of the birthday situation that you wouldn't plan your own birthday thing--even though you seem to love it--and wouldn't bother including your family on your own celebration, to the point of being so petty as to deny them even a slice of your cake--which you are perfectly entitled--though laughably--to do.\n3. Your husband didn't bother getting you a cake, but is indignant that you're going to eat a whole one.\n4. Your actions are frankly odd.  I assume that your husband has toys or sporting gear that he shares with your boys, even though he bought it himself, and the boys don't help.  Whether that's an X-Box or a tennis racquet.  By your logic, your husband shouldn't share those things under the premise that if they wanted to play tennis with him, they should have bought a racquet--or their own TV and X-Box.\n\nHere's what I really think.\n\nI think you want people to be into ***YOUR*** birthday.  I think you want a day where you get to feel super-special.  Which is fine.  But let's not pretend like what you did was anywhere in the same zip code as \"normal\".  Sure, you're entitled.  I could get a giant pizza and eat it all myself, and I could buy a giant hard-drive to store all my Blu-ray rips, and not let anyone else watch it.  I mean, my money, my choice, right?  But that's weird.  The entire point is that the family benefits from everyone's actions--especially mom and dad's actions.\n\nI also think you're using this insane birthday excuse to 1) eat a cake, and 2) be petty toward your family.  If you cared this much, why be passive aggressive about it?  Your husband--and children--should be considerate enough to do what you want for your birthday.  And if that's have a big thing, then they should do it.  If he doesn't do it for yours--but accepts parties you throw him, then he's an asshole.  But, why not just use \"grownup words\" and say: \"Ed, look, I want a ltitle fanfare for my birthday.  Let's at least do cake and a card and 1 special thing that you and the boys plan,\" or whatever it is that you actually want.\n\nWhy be passive aggressive and eat an entire cake on your own (isn't part of the fun of a birthday cake the sharing, and not just the eating)?  Isn't eating that entire thing on your own just a reminder--every time you take a bite--that your family doesn't care about your birthday?  Why not just ask for what you want?", "ESH why are you hiding stuff from your husband? That's toxic. He is an ass for not doing more for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But it's selfish nonetheless because he's making decisions about your birthday based on how he feels about birthdays. \n\nMaybe this cake incident could be the opener to a conversation about how important your birthday is to you and how you felt that you had to treat and spoil yourself because nobody else was going to.", "People should care less about this arbitrary celebration.\n\nOP says it herself:\n\n> *It's almost like he thinks spontaneous gift giving through out the year (which he does a lot) is more \"real\".*\n\nExcept that it's not almost.  He has his reason, he lives up to it.

You should assert your copyright on such a novel put down. LOL\n\nAhh thanks for that! I absolutely will. \n\nI mean my husband doesn't like birthdays but know how much I love them has been making an effort to make them amazing each year. And he still gives me spontaneous gifts like I give him. For him it is like it's just one day out of the year that matters to me so he cares enough to make it special for me because he loves me. People do that when they care for someone. OP got a cake for herself, because no one else cares about her birthday and she is allowed to enjoy her cake by herself, it's not like her kids would have eaten something someday Outside and would have thought, oh I need to share it with my mother because it isn't expected then why is it expected of her. Plus her husband didn't even wish her a happy birthday, why does he want that birthday cake now? Just saying."]}
