I also make sure to keep a calendar of birthdays for my family/friends and for my in laws so I can remind my husband to get a card or for us to bring cake to his siblings' places.\n\nThe problem is that my husband hates birthdays. Though he never refutes his own party, he tends to moan and groan about the hassle of \"getting a card\" and \"spending money of gifts\" for our boys and other family members.\n\nAt first this really bothered me because I took it as \"he doesn't care to celebrate out lives.\" But I reminded myself that he does a lot for me and the people he loves, so maybe it's just not his thing. He's also lackluster on Christmas, so what ever. \n\nThis leads into the 12th. It was my birthday, and I got this beautiful cake done for myself from a baker. I snuck it into the house and had a piece while the boys were at school and my husband was at work, then stuck it in the freezer in the garage so that I could pick away at it, completely in secret from the rest of the family. I figured that if they wanted to celebrate my b-day with me, they would get me a cake themselves. I shouldn't have to throw my own party for their benefit.\n\nWell today my husband found the cake and asked about it. I told him that it was for my b-day, and he said \"but there's already a piece missing.\"\n\n I explained that no, it was my birthday on Friday and I got myself a cake to celebrate. \n\nHe then asks me \"well when were you gonna share it with us?\"\n\nTo which I told him never...because it's my cake. If he wanted to have a cake with me, he could have gotten me one on my birthday.\n\nHe then exclaims \"So you're just gonna eat a whole cake?\"\n\nAnd I tell him yes, yes I will, because it's my cake and I can take as long as I want to go through it.\n\nHe told me that this was greedy and that he thinks its unreasonable for me to eat an ENTIRE cake myself. He even told our oldest about it, and my oldest laughed and said \"honestly I'd do the same thing.\"\n\nIdk, I could be the asshole for being greedy and I guess no one should eat an entire cake for themselves...But it's not like I had it all at once, I only had one piece and will take my time getting through the rest.

You're ***SO*** into birthdays that you take it as a slight that your husband don't care about them (I'm the exact same way as your husband, except I refuse parties, and ask to be left alone, and often just get myself a hotel room to basically just relax and have some peace and quiet; my wife ***LOVES*** birthdays, so we make a huge fuss on hers and our daughter's).\n2. You're ***SO*** bent out of shape by the \"asymmetry\" of the birthday situation that you wouldn't plan your own birthday thing--even though you seem to love it--and wouldn't bother including your family on your own celebration, to the point of being so petty as to deny them even a slice of your cake--which you are perfectly entitled--though laughably--to do.\n3. Your husband didn't bother getting you a cake, but is indignant that you're going to eat a whole one.\n4. Your actions are frankly odd.  I assume that your husband has toys or sporting gear that he shares with your boys, even though he bought it himself, and the boys don't help.  Whether that's an X-Box or a tennis racquet.  By your logic, your husband shouldn't share those things under the premise that if they wanted to play tennis with him, they should have bought a racquet--or their own TV and X-Box.\n\nHere's what I really think.\n\nI think you want people to be into ***YOUR*** birthday.  I think you want a day where you get to feel super-special.  Which is fine.  But let's not pretend like what you did was anywhere in the same zip code as \"normal\".  Sure, you're entitled.  I could get a giant pizza and eat it all myself, and I could buy a giant hard-drive to store all my Blu-ray rips, and not let anyone else watch it.  I mean, my money, my choice, right?  But that's weird.  The entire point is that the family benefits from everyone's actions--especially mom and dad's actions.\n\nI also think you're using this insane birthday excuse to 1) eat a cake, and 2) be petty toward your family.  If you cared this much, why be passive aggressive about it?  Your husband--and children--should be considerate enough to do what you want for your birthday.  And if that's have a big thing, then they should do it.  If he doesn't do it for yours--but accepts parties you throw him, then he's an asshole.  But, why not just use \"grownup words\" and say: \"Ed, look, I want a ltitle fanfare for my birthday.  Let's at least do cake and a card and 1 special thing that you and the boys plan,\" or whatever it is that you actually want.\n\nWhy be passive aggressive and eat an entire cake on your own (isn't part of the fun of a birthday cake the sharing, and not just the eating)?  Isn't eating that entire thing on your own just a reminder--every time you take a bite--that your family doesn't care about your birthday?  Why not just ask for what you want?", "ESH why are you hiding stuff from your husband? That's toxic. He is an ass for not doing more for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is actually genius so even though it\u2019s not my birthday, I\u2019m off to buy myself a freezer cake!", "INFO: What kind of cake is it?", "NTA I will never understand why some people have such a problem with celebrating people they're supposed to love", "The best part of being an adult is you can buy and eat a whole cake if you want to.\n\nNTA but he is!", "NTA\n\nAs someone who hates birthdays (mine and others\u2019), I can sort of relate to that with your husband. But if your partner knows you care about birthdays to the extent you seem to they should be sucking it up and doing something for you. \n\nEnjoy the cake \ud83c\udf82", "NTA! This is so epic! I may have to do this myself lol", "NTA, you shouldn\u2019t have to buy your own birthday cake but absolutely bravo for doing so! \n\nEnjoy every last piece of it!", "NTA. I can see in my mind a situation where you bought yourself a necklace in secret because he didn't even give you a card and then he got mad that you didn't think to get him a Rolex. That's really how it all sounds.", "Lesson learned here is husband is mad at himself. No cake for him!\n\nNta", "NTA\n\nIt sounds to me like he\u2019s angry at himself for caring so little that he can\u2019t even remember your birthday to the point where you don\u2019t bring it up anymore and even buy gifts for yourself on your own birthday, but he\u2019s trying to find a way to direct the anger at you because it\u2019s less hurtful if it\u2019s framed as you attacking him for that, even though you didn\u2019t say anything and actively tried to hide what you were doing. You are so obviously in the right that he\u2019s jumping to the conclusion of you doing it on purpose, but he knows he can\u2019t say that directly.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t justify anything he\u2019s saying or doing, and it\u2019s his job to change for the better, but this may at least help you understand what\u2019s going on so that you don\u2019t keep thinking that it\u2019s somehow your fault. Right now you find it easier to believe that you\u2019re missing something than the fact that he really is acting completely irrationally, but he *really is* acting completely irrationally.", "NTA. You can have your own cake and eat it too", "NTA", "NTA you are correct. If he wanted to celebrate your birthday with you he would have got you a cake. It shouldn\u2019t be up to you to but your own cake", "NTA.\n\nThis wasn't even about the cake.", "NTA Stop doing anything for the man's birthdays and holidays. He says he doesn't like them to get out of the work and not to pay for no other reasons. Don't put in the work for him if he doesn't put out for anyone else. Bet he moans and groans about being left out ~~as much as~~ more than he does about spending for others.", "NTA. Your cake your birthday.  This was a cake you bought for yourself. You can take a year to eat it if you want.  If they wanted to eat birthday cake with you then they should have bought a cake", "That\u2019s not a cake - it\u2019s a message.", "Well he doesn\u2019t get to have it both ways. He can\u2019t complain about the effort and expense of celebrating birthdays AND ALSO complain about being excluded from the effort, expense and benefits of celebrating birthdays. Birthdays aren\u2019t his thing? Fine. But then he doesn\u2019t get to enjoy the cake he didn\u2019t remember to buy. Simple as that.", "It's sad even her child agrees with her. I hope when these children are grown up, they will spoil their mother since their AH selfish father seems unwilling to.", "Honestly, it sounds like he didn't even know her birthday had passed by. My hubs may suck at birthdays, but at least he put it on his damn calendar \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I'm not particularly into birthdays, I like to go out for a meal with my family but that's it. My wife on the other hand likes a party, so when it's her birthday, guess what happens? We have a party! Because my preferences are pretty much irrelevant, it's her birthday so I make the effort to do what *she* likes.", "> Who says you can't have your cake and eat it, too?!!\n\nI always find people saying it wrong to be funny because, yes, you literally can have your cake and eat it too. It is a pretty simple feat to accomplish. It's you can't eat your cake and have it too.", "Toxic? Why?", "Birthday cakes are meant to be shared\u2026 with people who care enough to celebrate with you. Sounds like none even thought to say the words Happy Birthday, so why\u2019d they get to eat the cake she bought for herself?", "It\u2019s because if you *eat* it, you won\u2019t *have* it anymore\u2026it will be gone", "Caring about your partner and the things that matter to them is basic decency, not something that makes them an \u201cincredible partner\u201d.", ">He doesn't mind me throwing parties for his birthday, but he just doesn't feel like putting one on for me is meaningful.\n\nOh honey, no. He doesn't mind you throwing parties for his birthday because he is still celebrated and gets to feel special/enjoy attention/receive a treat (like cake). \n\nHe might not care for parties, but you like to celebrate the people you love with a party in their honor. That's fine.\n\nWhat's not fine is him knowing this is a love language for you and just blowing it off as \"not meaningful.\" He didn't even remember which day is your birthday, yet he demands a share of the cake?!\n\nMy spouse and I don't do much for our birthdays in terms of big celebrations or parties. But there's this one restaurant I dislike that he adores. If he wants to go there on his birthday, that's what we do, because it's not my day/not about me. It's something that gives him enjoyment and I can suck it up for one day because I love him even if he loves (to my mind) a terrible restaurant. Because that's part of compromise in long term relationships.\n\nThis may just be one facet of your lives together.  I get it, truly. But if your spouse wants to have a piece of the cake, he needs to own his laziness as it relates to your birthday and his lack of effort to even acknowledge the correct date. He needs to consider his own greediness in always accepting the parties and celebrations you put in the effort for him on, while he has missed the mark completely.", "I\u2019m sorry, what?? Nobody even acknowledging your birthday is terrible, and I think you should edit your post to include that. My parents would have flayed me alive if I forgot to wish someone in the house happy birthday and get them a gift. It\u2019s one thing to not want to plan a party, but I think that spouses should want to make each other happy. I think it\u2019s alarming that he holds such little regard for your feelings. He knows how important it is to you, and the LEAST he could\u2019ve done was acknowledge your birthday. And getting you a cake isn\u2019t some huge task either.", "He thinks spontaneous gift giving is more \"real\" because it makes him look thoughtful, and it makes him feel good. He knows birthdays are important to you, and it would make you feel good, but making you feel good clearly isn't a priority for him. Like, I don't care how \"in his own world\" he is\u2014he can put your birthday in his Google calendar and set a reminder to buy you a card and some cake. And honestly the fact that this lack of caring has rubbed off on your children, who also didn't acknowledge you with a \"happy birthday\"? Super upsetting.", "I'm sorry, but no, that's no compromise.\n\nHe hates birthday celebrations, you love them.\n\nA fair compromise would be to not do anything on his birthday (since it's HIS day and HE doesn't like them) and go all out on your birthday (YOUR day and YOU like them).\nIdeally he'd organize your b-day, but he'd most likely pull a weaponized incompetence move and leave you unhappy. Best plan it yourself then.\n\nAlso your kids treating you like this isn't OK either, unless they, too, don't want anything for their own birthdays. A simple \"Happy Birthday\" and a nice gesture can be done by everyone and isn't too much to ask.\n\nNTA", "Here is a very important question for you. Does he actually give you spontaneous meaningful gifts throughout the year? If he does not then it is just a pathetic excuse, from a pathetic man. And if that's the case you should significantly reevaluate how you are living your life. And how you are letting him treat you.", "That\u2019s really fucked up that you were forgotten in that way. I, too, look forward to birthdays. I even threw myself a decent party this year and spent the next few days being celebrated by my friends and partner through dinners, gifts, and experiences. \n\nHell, even my young niblings made me a card! \n\nThe point is, that you deserve to be celebrated and your husband KNOWS how much birthdays mean to you and should have 1) remembered your birthday & 2) celebrated you the way you wanted to be celebrated."]}
