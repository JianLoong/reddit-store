I also make sure to keep a calendar of birthdays for my family/friends and for my in laws so I can remind my husband to get a card or for us to bring cake to his siblings' places.\n\nThe problem is that my husband hates birthdays. Though he never refutes his own party, he tends to moan and groan about the hassle of \"getting a card\" and \"spending money of gifts\" for our boys and other family members.\n\nAt first this really bothered me because I took it as \"he doesn't care to celebrate out lives.\" But I reminded myself that he does a lot for me and the people he loves, so maybe it's just not his thing. He's also lackluster on Christmas, so what ever. \n\nThis leads into the 12th. It was my birthday, and I got this beautiful cake done for myself from a baker. I snuck it into the house and had a piece while the boys were at school and my husband was at work, then stuck it in the freezer in the garage so that I could pick away at it, completely in secret from the rest of the family. I figured that if they wanted to celebrate my b-day with me, they would get me a cake themselves. I shouldn't have to throw my own party for their benefit.\n\nWell today my husband found the cake and asked about it. I told him that it was for my b-day, and he said \"but there's already a piece missing.\"\n\n I explained that no, it was my birthday on Friday and I got myself a cake to celebrate. \n\nHe then asks me \"well when were you gonna share it with us?\"\n\nTo which I told him never...because it's my cake. If he wanted to have a cake with me, he could have gotten me one on my birthday.\n\nHe then exclaims \"So you're just gonna eat a whole cake?\"\n\nAnd I tell him yes, yes I will, because it's my cake and I can take as long as I want to go through it.\n\nHe told me that this was greedy and that he thinks its unreasonable for me to eat an ENTIRE cake myself. He even told our oldest about it, and my oldest laughed and said \"honestly I'd do the same thing.\"\n\nIdk, I could be the asshole for being greedy and I guess no one should eat an entire cake for themselves...But it's not like I had it all at once, I only had one piece and will take my time getting through the rest.

You're ***SO*** into birthdays that you take it as a slight that your husband don't care about them (I'm the exact same way as your husband, except I refuse parties, and ask to be left alone, and often just get myself a hotel room to basically just relax and have some peace and quiet; my wife ***LOVES*** birthdays, so we make a huge fuss on hers and our daughter's).\n2. You're ***SO*** bent out of shape by the \"asymmetry\" of the birthday situation that you wouldn't plan your own birthday thing--even though you seem to love it--and wouldn't bother including your family on your own celebration, to the point of being so petty as to deny them even a slice of your cake--which you are perfectly entitled--though laughably--to do.\n3. Your husband didn't bother getting you a cake, but is indignant that you're going to eat a whole one.\n4. Your actions are frankly odd.  I assume that your husband has toys or sporting gear that he shares with your boys, even though he bought it himself, and the boys don't help.  Whether that's an X-Box or a tennis racquet.  By your logic, your husband shouldn't share those things under the premise that if they wanted to play tennis with him, they should have bought a racquet--or their own TV and X-Box.\n\nHere's what I really think.\n\nI think you want people to be into ***YOUR*** birthday.  I think you want a day where you get to feel super-special.  Which is fine.  But let's not pretend like what you did was anywhere in the same zip code as \"normal\".  Sure, you're entitled.  I could get a giant pizza and eat it all myself, and I could buy a giant hard-drive to store all my Blu-ray rips, and not let anyone else watch it.  I mean, my money, my choice, right?  But that's weird.  The entire point is that the family benefits from everyone's actions--especially mom and dad's actions.\n\nI also think you're using this insane birthday excuse to 1) eat a cake, and 2) be petty toward your family.  If you cared this much, why be passive aggressive about it?  Your husband--and children--should be considerate enough to do what you want for your birthday.  And if that's have a big thing, then they should do it.  If he doesn't do it for yours--but accepts parties you throw him, then he's an asshole.  But, why not just use \"grownup words\" and say: \"Ed, look, I want a ltitle fanfare for my birthday.  Let's at least do cake and a card and 1 special thing that you and the boys plan,\" or whatever it is that you actually want.\n\nWhy be passive aggressive and eat an entire cake on your own (isn't part of the fun of a birthday cake the sharing, and not just the eating)?  Isn't eating that entire thing on your own just a reminder--every time you take a bite--that your family doesn't care about your birthday?  Why not just ask for what you want?", "ESH why are you hiding stuff from your husband? That's toxic. He is an ass for not doing more for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

A b-day cake is more that \"a cake I have for my birthday\", it's the center of the \"Birthday Celebration\" event.\n\nIt's like calling a ring you bought near your wedding date(as a gift to yourself) your wedding ring.  \nLike.... the name you gave it isnt entirely accurate, since that name carries some connotations, as well as your actions regarding it.\n\nYour point was right, but you shouldve just called that cake \"my birthday **gift** to myself\" and avoided all that turbulence", "NTA\n\nPersonally I would share just cause, but all your feelings are justified. I get not wanting to celebrate your own bday. But not wanting to celebrate your partner's bday, especially when you know that it is important to her... Smh. Poor you, you should stop doing anything nice for him for any especially dates.", "IS your husband eating silly pills for breaky? He wants to cash in on your birthday and probably everyone else's while I'm sure enjoying his own glorious cake, but refuses to reciprocate. It's your birthday. The VERY best thing about being an adult is eating whatever you want. This too includes buying your own birthday cake and gift and not sharing. Your family seems to take but not give in turn. So no, it is your birthday not his or theirs. Which means YOU can eat all the cake you want and not share. NTA and many happy returns.", "You're not the first mother to hide a cake in the freezer. NTA.", "NTA. I hate  my birthday for a myriad of reasons. BUT I will celebrate others birthdays, without complaint because I know that to some people, birthdays are important. \n\nHe's the AH if he failed to celebrate your birthday.", "NTA", "Nope. NTA. If they won't celebrate you, YOU celebrate you!  Happy late Birthday!", "NTA \n\nI also dislike my birthday.  However I know my feelings on that are not the popular opinion in my family. So I always  celebrate my husband and kids. It's not that hard. It would have taken minimal effort for him to stop by the store and pick up a few things to wish you a happy birthday.  If he wanted cake the grocery store has a ton of cakes already made and waiting to be bought. \n\nIt might be time to have a sit down with him and talk about birthdays to figure out  plan for  birthdays going forward and expressing to him why they are important to you.  \n\nMy husband understands I hate my birthday because  it's on a major holiday and celebrating  birthdays is important to him. So we compromised and he picks a random day outside of my actual birthday and surprises me with birthday cake and gifts from the kids. It works for us. I hope you guys can find a compromise of your own.", "It is still not too late to buy yourself a birthday gift!", "She said he's lackluster on Christmas too. Its not that he \"isn't into birthdays.\" He's lazy and doesn't want to do for others. If he isn't into celebrations at all, fine. He gets no goodies from those celebrations.", "And one of the perks of being an adult is that you can buy yourself a cake whenever you want. The sky's the limit!\n\nKudos to the OP for celebrating herself!", "Right? It\u2019s not like cakes are on the endangered species list.", "This x \ud83d\udcaf", "He's gonna eat it anyway to reassert his sense of control over the situation.", "This was so petty, it filled my soul and gave me new life.", "did he forget ops birthday entirely? cause that\u2019s. not great. to forget your spouses birthday and then be mad you didn\u2019t get cake. wtf. nta, enjoy your cake.", "That is an adorable compromise", "I read that as \u201cif I were an adult and could buy a whole cake just for myself, I would,\u201d rather than as a comment on the parents\u2019 relationship.", "This x \ud83d\udcaf", "OP... Making an effort for your partner is not being an incredible partner, is *the bare minimum*, and your husband is not only complaining and not doing the bare minutes but also pestering you for cover his lack of the bare minimum.\n\nNTA but you deserve better", "It's meaningful if it means something TO YOU.", "If you\u2019re in a country that celebrated Mothers\u2019 Day this weekend, I hope they at least did something for you then.", "Not really.  The husband doesn't want parties and wants to be left alone on his birthday, but she plows through that because of what she wants. The kids are irrelevant because all kids are terrible at their parents' birthdays. The ideal would be for her to leave him alone on his day and plan something up to her standards for herself. \n\nThe eating a cake by herself thing is weird and petty. Like do you, but it's the same as downing a bottle of whiskey alone.  Good for the sad maybe, but bad for you overall.", "But I hope you wouldn't hide anything as that isn't healthy and good for any relationship. The fact you aren't even talking about hiding stuff is a tell.", "Because healthy people in relationships don't hide stuff from their partner. Also a partner withholding isn't really a partner I am surprised more people aren't pointing this out. I assume it's the fact op is a woman and statistically speaking females are judged less harshly then men in this sub.", "Doesn't that maybe tell you something?  How annoying of a person do you have to be for everyone to avoid you on your birthday?", "I love this comment!   Finally a real life version of the old saying!  Husband is a jerk.", "Good for you to treating yourself to a cake.", "Yeah, but even that doesn\u2019t really make sense.  It\u2019s not like she\u2019s eating it all in one sitting.\n\nIf we order a pizza every Thursday and I eat  25% of it each time, at the end of the month I\u2019ve eaten a whole pizza by myself.  (And if he\u2019s like then men in my life, he\u2019s eaten at least the equivalent of 2 in that time). \n\nLet\u2019s say I like weird toppings.  If I buy myself a frozen pineapple and artichoke pizza at the beginning of the month and heat up 1/4 of it on Thursday when everyone else is eating the one ordered, I\u2019m still eating an entire pizza by myself. Is that different if it\u2019s something he doesn\u2019t like?  If my frozen pizza was the same toppings as the ones we order, would it matter?  If we switch to ordering sushi, and I keep eating my pizza, does that matter?\n\nPoint is, it\u2019s that the same amount of food is being eaten over the same time period.  Doesn\u2019t matter to me if it\u2019s cake, pizza, sushi, or hot dogs.  \n\nIf he wants cake, tell him to get a damn cake and maybe get his head out of his ass and remember his wife\u2019s birthday.", "I've eaten the equivalent of many cakes in my lifetime. If she has a piece of cake every couple days for the next couple weeks, is it any different than eating a couple cookies or grabbing a doughnut on the way to work? She's not sitting down and inhaling a five tier wedding cake in an evening.", "Petty is my favorite color.\n\nNTA", "Yeah, I was like, that kid is getting ideas now \ud83d\ude04", "Growing up, my sister used to lick her fingers and drag them across the pie she liked so no one else would eat it.  My mom eventually taught us both to make it and refused to do so anymore.", "I'm just marvelling at the genius of putting it in the freezer - it was my birthday last month and my housemates and friends were all away for various reasons, and I live the other side of the country to my family so it was just me and my cat, so I was like damn it I'm still having cake and bought an 8serves cake for myself and then had it for 3 meals a day over the weekend and was sick of cake by the end - if I'd put it int he freezer I could have savoured it better", "Ah, thanks, I have never received an award before. I am glowing. :)", "This would be fair if she would stop forcing parties on him for his birthday.  They both need to meet their partners wants and needs.", "That the kids christmas and brithdays are left to op is not irrelavant? It is not on them to do stuff, yes, but it would also be husbands job to bring the magic.\n\n\nAlso, husband is already offended that op didn't plan amd celebrate her brithday with him, do you really think he would be fine with her not celebrating his brithday? O.o like... did we read the same post? He hates planning, writing cards and buying gifts, not eating cake, getting gifts and celebrating.", "If someone is so annoying you can\u2019t even get them a cake for their birthday, don\u2019t marry them.", ">If I buy myself a frozen pineapple and artichoke pizza at the beginning of the month\n\nI really hope that's just a hypothetical", "People who brag about how much money they throw around seem like narcissists to me.", "Um the vast majority of the world\u2026 birthdays are celebrated practically world wide and most people receive some form of gifts whether food, experiences or physical gifts on their birthday by loved ones. People who don\u2019t want to do that should form their own colonies and not benefit from others gifts while refusing to return the favor.\n\nEdit: I reread and so your comment that you don\u2019t mind spontaneous gift giving- but it smacks of control and a refusal to engage in normal societal expectation even if you are generous outside of that- doesn\u2019t mean you have to spend an arm and a leg but acknowledgement and caring on a day that is literally all about celebrating a person is really f\u2019ing reasonable", "My birthday is the one day I get treated to anything. It's not narcissistic to want one singular day when you're not taking care of others and get a break for once in your life.", "She is not forcing anyone - there is no indication that he has told her not to hold parties for him", "My understanding from the comments is that he thinks birthdays are useless and arbitrary.  He provides random acts of kindness and gifts throughout the year. He puts up with her birthday planning, but labels it as a waste of time and money.", "That's fair, but how did literally the whole world choose to ignore her?  It sounds like it's a much bigger problem than just her immediate family.", "And she isn't willing to put hers away to not celebrate his birthday.  It seems like they both have work to do", "Again, doesn\u2019t matter. Celebrate her birthday, and then the next day sit down with her and have a conversation about whatever other issues may exist. But don\u2019t ignore their birthday and then get upset that they won\u2019t share cake. If he cares that little for her, he shouldn\u2019t be married to her.", "Again, doesn\u2019t matter.

She knew he didn't do birthdays when they got married.", "What does that have to do with anything?  The kids and he should have the same autonomy to decide how to celebrate their birthdays that OP has", "But even then, that's assuming she's actually being annoying. On my birthday, my spouse is the one who does things like getting a cake for me. I have family members who call and say happy birthday, and a few friends, but the one who actually does something to celebrate the day is my spouse, and from what I've seem of other people who are married with children, its often the spouse who is in charge of coordinating any kind of birthday celebration stuff.", "She is teaching their kids that they should appreciate people on their birthdays- the Dad had no problem with the parties- he has never requested she stop. He just doesn\u2019t want o put the effort into hers. Also there is no indication that the kids don\u2019t want their birthdays celebrated. You don\u2019t accept being celebrated without returning the favor- if you don\u2019t want to celebrate birthdays and holidays- join one of those religions that don\u2019t or go be with like minded people"]}
