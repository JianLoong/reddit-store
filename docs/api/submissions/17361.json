I also make sure to keep a calendar of birthdays for my family/friends and for my in laws so I can remind my husband to get a card or for us to bring cake to his siblings' places.\n\nThe problem is that my husband hates birthdays. Though he never refutes his own party, he tends to moan and groan about the hassle of \"getting a card\" and \"spending money of gifts\" for our boys and other family members.\n\nAt first this really bothered me because I took it as \"he doesn't care to celebrate out lives.\" But I reminded myself that he does a lot for me and the people he loves, so maybe it's just not his thing. He's also lackluster on Christmas, so what ever. \n\nThis leads into the 12th. It was my birthday, and I got this beautiful cake done for myself from a baker. I snuck it into the house and had a piece while the boys were at school and my husband was at work, then stuck it in the freezer in the garage so that I could pick away at it, completely in secret from the rest of the family. I figured that if they wanted to celebrate my b-day with me, they would get me a cake themselves. I shouldn't have to throw my own party for their benefit.\n\nWell today my husband found the cake and asked about it. I told him that it was for my b-day, and he said \"but there's already a piece missing.\"\n\n I explained that no, it was my birthday on Friday and I got myself a cake to celebrate. \n\nHe then asks me \"well when were you gonna share it with us?\"\n\nTo which I told him never...because it's my cake. If he wanted to have a cake with me, he could have gotten me one on my birthday.\n\nHe then exclaims \"So you're just gonna eat a whole cake?\"\n\nAnd I tell him yes, yes I will, because it's my cake and I can take as long as I want to go through it.\n\nHe told me that this was greedy and that he thinks its unreasonable for me to eat an ENTIRE cake myself. He even told our oldest about it, and my oldest laughed and said \"honestly I'd do the same thing.\"\n\nIdk, I could be the asshole for being greedy and I guess no one should eat an entire cake for themselves...But it's not like I had it all at once, I only had one piece and will take my time getting through the rest.

You're ***SO*** into birthdays that you take it as a slight that your husband don't care about them (I'm the exact same way as your husband, except I refuse parties, and ask to be left alone, and often just get myself a hotel room to basically just relax and have some peace and quiet; my wife ***LOVES*** birthdays, so we make a huge fuss on hers and our daughter's).\n2. You're ***SO*** bent out of shape by the \"asymmetry\" of the birthday situation that you wouldn't plan your own birthday thing--even though you seem to love it--and wouldn't bother including your family on your own celebration, to the point of being so petty as to deny them even a slice of your cake--which you are perfectly entitled--though laughably--to do.\n3. Your husband didn't bother getting you a cake, but is indignant that you're going to eat a whole one.\n4. Your actions are frankly odd.  I assume that your husband has toys or sporting gear that he shares with your boys, even though he bought it himself, and the boys don't help.  Whether that's an X-Box or a tennis racquet.  By your logic, your husband shouldn't share those things under the premise that if they wanted to play tennis with him, they should have bought a racquet--or their own TV and X-Box.\n\nHere's what I really think.\n\nI think you want people to be into ***YOUR*** birthday.  I think you want a day where you get to feel super-special.  Which is fine.  But let's not pretend like what you did was anywhere in the same zip code as \"normal\".  Sure, you're entitled.  I could get a giant pizza and eat it all myself, and I could buy a giant hard-drive to store all my Blu-ray rips, and not let anyone else watch it.  I mean, my money, my choice, right?  But that's weird.  The entire point is that the family benefits from everyone's actions--especially mom and dad's actions.\n\nI also think you're using this insane birthday excuse to 1) eat a cake, and 2) be petty toward your family.  If you cared this much, why be passive aggressive about it?  Your husband--and children--should be considerate enough to do what you want for your birthday.  And if that's have a big thing, then they should do it.  If he doesn't do it for yours--but accepts parties you throw him, then he's an asshole.  But, why not just use \"grownup words\" and say: \"Ed, look, I want a ltitle fanfare for my birthday.  Let's at least do cake and a card and 1 special thing that you and the boys plan,\" or whatever it is that you actually want.\n\nWhy be passive aggressive and eat an entire cake on your own (isn't part of the fun of a birthday cake the sharing, and not just the eating)?  Isn't eating that entire thing on your own just a reminder--every time you take a bite--that your family doesn't care about your birthday?  Why not just ask for what you want?", "ESH why are you hiding stuff from your husband? That's toxic. He is an ass for not doing more for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe get him/her a solo cake for the next b-day, new tradition!", "NTA if he doesn\u2019t care for your birthday then it\u2019s perfectly fine for you to do it up for yourself. I\u2019m making a cake for my boyfriend\u2019s birthday. Tell hubby you\u2019re allowed to be greedy about cake on your birthday.", "Your husband is being a asshole. It's important to you. Even if it's not important to him he should care that you care. Getting you a card, a gift, and a small treat or cake isn't that freaking hard. One trip to the store for 10 to 20 minutes would cover all that. It's reasonable to expect some effort into something they know you care about. Your husband needs to do better.\n\nAlso I hope you enjoy the hell outta that cake all on your own.", "Yes, you are the asshole. But you already knew that.", "NTA, not even close. But your husband is a major AH. It doesn't after if he cares about celebrating bdays it's about putting in some sort of effort for those he loves who do care. He should be willing to do something for you and your kids.", "NTA. You need to start matching his energy for his birthday. Don\u2019t put energy into someone if they aren\u2019t going to reciprocate it. I also buy my own pie and eat it over time by myself because it\u2019s my pie. I like that your son laughed and would do the same.", "NTA - Not all people celebrate things in lavish ways and exchange gifts. My wife and I come from very different upbringings. However, to not even acknowledge a passed birthday? Who hurt this man?", "It\u2019s \u201cyou can\u2019t eat your cake and have it too\u201d, meaning once you\u2019ve eaten it you can no longer hold it (have it) as you have consumed it. :)", "Nope. Bad take.", "OP should stop doing anything for her husband on his birthday. See if he really doesn't care, or if he will complain.", "\"I can buy myself flowers, write my name in the sand...\"", "Your birthday came and went and NO ONE even said ANYTHING? \n\nI would be halfway across the globe right now taking a special vacation just for myself and they'd be lucky if I EVER returned home! \n\nWow...just wow. You have far more patience and understanding than I.", "Even if your kids were little, it's ok to have something for yourself. I'm sorry your husband literally didn't even realize your birthday had come and gone. That's pretty piss poor of him. NTA.", "Honestly NOTHING is stopping him from buying HIS OWN CAKE AND DOING THE EXACT SAME THING.", "Honestly NOTHING is stopping him from buying HIS OWN CAKE AND DOING THE EXACT SAME THING.", "He even moans and complains about doing something for their children on their birthdays. That's so selfish. Even if you don't like birthdays, you celebrate your children.", "It was for my birthday.\n\nBut there's already a piece missing. \n\nYes because I ate it ON MY BIRTHDAY.", "Now I am singing along with you. :)\n\nVery appropriate here, too.", "Agree. OP, stop doing anything for his birthday, and start planning your own from now on. Plan it just how you like it.", "Agree. Also, only giving gifts when HE wants to, probably makes him feel in control.\n\nAnd the kids - that's just sad. My sweet 6yo daughter was so excited for my birthday this year - more than I was - and had been working on a book with drawings as a gift for me. It's not about the money, but the thought.", "Yes! NTA op", "And OP said she literally has a calendar with everyones birthdays on it", "Giving the husband as much credit as I can (maybe more than he deserves) it might be that he wants to be appreciative and loving on his own basis, rather than feeling like he has to show love and affection because of some particular date. Would make sense why he's not bothered about Xmas either.\n\nCurious how he handles other set date events, like anniversaries, etc.\n\nCourse this is all just speculation.", "Yeah this is the part that's crazy to me, like a mini buried lede. Did he even know or celebrate her birthday at all? Poor OP. Personally I think when it comes to birthdays and celebrations, spouses who are not as \"into\" them should up their energy a bit to match spouses that are. If something is important to your spouse it should be at least somewhat important to you as well.", "Only reason I hold onto my job, money to buy cakes", "Nobody thinks people are batshit crazy for celebrating their birthday. Except people who like to suck the joy out of people's days and make them feel bad for being happy.", "Did you not read my first comment? He needs to be doing way more. Please read what I wrote before attacking", "Because individual cake or snacks should not impact a healthy marriage", "I love this, X 1,000. \nYes you can have your (own) cake and eat it too!!\n\n\n\ud83e\udd70", "YTA. You're hoarding a cake. What are you, 8?", "YTA for being so petty and taking this out on others INCLUDING your kids instead of communicating like a grown up. This is like... therapy worthy petty. The mental image of someone hiding a whole ass cake from her family to get back at them is not normal.", "NTA, he dont give a crap bout anyone else bday \\[even his own\\]. But he gets angry when someone spends money on themselves to get themself a treat.", "You take care of you. NTA at all. Hubby's just embarrassed he didn't do anything for you and butthurt that you went and got one yourself.", "My hubby loves sweets. I do not eat them at all. I love to treat him to his favorite baked goods. He keeps his cookies and cake in the freezer and eats a little serving every day. It is such a cute little habit. OP deserves her own cake! NTA.", "Before you're a wife and a mom, you're you. So why can't *you* have a whole cake to yourself? Why does he think you're obligated to share everything? He didn't care about your feelings enough to do something for your birthday, because he was too up in his. \n\nNta", "No, not at all. Definitely NTA. I can relate to your experience quite a bit, coming from a highly dysfunctional family. You're my heroine. Happy birthday!", "Why can\u2019t he buy a cake for yoy", "NTA, you\u2019re a grown adult who can eat a whole cake for your birthday. He\u2019s being rude.", "NTA I'm more of a loner and preferred not going to relatives birthday/holiday parties and my mom would always tell me \"If you don't go to the party, you're not getting any cake.\" She'd tell the relative no when they'd try to send a slice home.\nHe didn't want to \"go to the party\" so he doesn't get any cake.", "NTA: but you need to have a conversation with your husband. I like the concept of \u201clove languages\u201d. What\u2019s important to you as evidence of love may not be what\u2019s important to him. But in a high functioning relationship he would understand what you care about and make that happen. And you would reciprocate, not by giving him what would make you happy, but by giving him what would make him happy.", "NTA.\n\nThis is one of the few times you CAN have your cake and eat it too.  (The \"you\" here being YOU, not your husband)\n\nAnd your husband needs to pick a lane.  Seems like he's just fine when a birthday benefits him.  Sounds more like he doesn't like OTHER PEOPLE'S birthdays.  And he CAN'T have his cake and eat it too.", "Absolutely NTA. Hubs is TA.", "Oddly, your story reminded me of a book I read as a child. I think it was an Aesop story? A goose was making some bread, and asked 3 other animals if they could help make it with her. They had no interest in working, so each time she asked, they refused to help. It wasn\u2019t until the bread was done that the others were interested. They asked if they could have some bread, to which the goose refused and ate all the bread herself.\n\nYou\u2019re the goose here. You got yourself your own cake. So, I think it\u2019s fair that you get to eat the whole cake since your husband, like the other animals in the story, didn\u2019t put an ounce of effort into your birthday. He didn\u2019t even acknowledge your birthday! NTA; the cake is all yours", "NTA, also I hate your husband.", "NTA, I would do the same, and even your oldest agreed! Enjoy your cake. If husband wants cake he can get his own. He's a grown man after all", "NTA at all. If you have to celebrate your birthday on your own and buy your own cake, why shouldn't you get to have it all. \n\nIt's your cake.", "What's wrong with eating an entire cake yourself?  If you slice it into 12 pieces and have one every month on the 12th you could be celebrating yourself for a year.  I think that's great!\n\nFuck him.\n\nNTA", "Does he not mind though? It could very well be that he just goes along with it to be polite. (Or heck, even that she steamrolls him and throws him a lavish party without asking what he genuinely wants.)\n\nThis really seems more like a matter of them failing to communicate with each other or consider disparate love languages.", "The kids not wishing her a happy birthday is the hardest part of the story, I think. They *are* old enough to remember her birthday but didn't. Since they are still kids or kid-esque, I'm putting that responsibility on Dad. He didn't raise them to respect their mother which is so much worse than just disliking birthdays. My heart breaks for you, OP.", "It was in a comment, totally understandable.", "NTA. Pretty original idea.", "NTA: and how lazy and spoiled is he that getting a card or spending some money on his loved ones drives him to bitch and Moan? It's a trip to Walgreens my guy, get over it.", "NTA. He can\u2019t skip the pleasantries of a birthday but still expect to receive his end of the deal. I\u2019m shocked that as your husband he doesn\u2019t make an effort to keep birthdays magical for you or your kids", "NTA", "As an adult, he can go out & buy his own cake whenever. \ud83d\ude44", "NTA OP, but! Consider precutting and individually wrapping the pieces. It makes it a lot easier to grab a piece to snack on...though maybe that is a bad idea. It depends on how long you want to spread it out. I got a chocolate cake from the grocery store and cut it into 16th and individually saran wrapped each piece and froze them. Didn't even wait to defrost to snack when I grabbed one. It was awesome.", "NTA, enjoy your cake. Maybe if he gave a damn about celebrating this could\u2019ve been avoided. Which type did you get btw ?", "What an opportunity to fulfill all of our childhood dream, having a cake, sharing it with no one :D  About time your grown up self got one! Everyone should be allowed to get into the greedy part of ourself at least once.You're not the AH. \n\nGood on your son for laughing about it. You raised him at least semi-right (what is left, is to make his mom a breakfast and buy a gift for her birthday). But your HB must be a bit thick not getting the message. I don't know how more clear you could have been. \n\nBut maybe the compromise is that you'll leave him alone on his birthday, while he has to put his effort into yours?", "NTA!  So your family forgot your birthday and now your husband is mad that you aren't sharing the cake you got for yourself?!?", "I\u2019d stop throwing parties for the husband. When his birthday comes around he\u2019ll be welcome to buy, stash and eat his own cake.", "I do feel like the majority of \"why can't we just celebrate our love every day, forget Valentines Day\" sort of people actually don't do that, ever. They use the idea of making every day special to avoid making any day special.\n\nThe sort of people who do make an effort year around also tend to be the people who put in extra effort in the holidays...", "But that circles back again to how selfish he is. This isn\u2019t about when and how he wants to give love and make an effort, it\u2019s about how OP feels appreciated. And if you can\u2019t actually move your ass and get a cake and a card, which must be one of the simplest tasks, for your partner\u2026 you don\u2019t love them.", "NTA. Youre an adult, you paid for the cake and its not like youre downing a whole cake in one sitting. You can eat all the damn cake you want. It sounds to me like hes trying to make it a you problem by fixating on the cake so he can avoid acknowledging that he didnt do squat for you on your birthday.\n\nHe did nothing on your birthday, he wont own up to it and hes trying to deflect by trying to put you on the spot. What a jerk.", "NTA. Did no one ever tell him he is allowed to just buy a cake on his own as an adult whenever he wants. And eat it all himself. Any time he wants. They need to hand out tips and tricks books when you reach adulthood", "NTA.\n\nYou gifted yourself a cake. No one else is entitled to it.", "NTA- freezing cake and keeping it to yourself is an excellent move. I do that for my own birthday. Of course, I live alone so no one can complain. But still, you are 100% right that if he wants to celebrate your birthday, he can get a cake and put the bare minimum effort into wishing you a happy birthday.", "Tbh this would be a dealbreaker. I DONT MEAN OP TO DIVORCE. Im saying if im dating a guy who doesn\u2019t show some effort and that he cares on special days\u2026 idk. When you lack love in your life you just want to feel appreciated once in a while and I wouldn\u2019t stand a lifetime of that", "she wasn't hiding it necessarily. She got the cake for herself and is storing it in the freezer so it'll stay good and so she'll be able to continue eating it. She didnt announce the cake to her husband bc she doesn't need to?", "Pure chaos.", "Her kids aren't the ones complaining about the cake. The oldest even said he'd do the same. Why does she need to share with them?"]}
