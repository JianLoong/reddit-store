I also make sure to keep a calendar of birthdays for my family/friends and for my in laws so I can remind my husband to get a card or for us to bring cake to his siblings' places.\n\nThe problem is that my husband hates birthdays. Though he never refutes his own party, he tends to moan and groan about the hassle of \"getting a card\" and \"spending money of gifts\" for our boys and other family members.\n\nAt first this really bothered me because I took it as \"he doesn't care to celebrate out lives.\" But I reminded myself that he does a lot for me and the people he loves, so maybe it's just not his thing. He's also lackluster on Christmas, so what ever. \n\nThis leads into the 12th. It was my birthday, and I got this beautiful cake done for myself from a baker. I snuck it into the house and had a piece while the boys were at school and my husband was at work, then stuck it in the freezer in the garage so that I could pick away at it, completely in secret from the rest of the family. I figured that if they wanted to celebrate my b-day with me, they would get me a cake themselves. I shouldn't have to throw my own party for their benefit.\n\nWell today my husband found the cake and asked about it. I told him that it was for my b-day, and he said \"but there's already a piece missing.\"\n\n I explained that no, it was my birthday on Friday and I got myself a cake to celebrate. \n\nHe then asks me \"well when were you gonna share it with us?\"\n\nTo which I told him never...because it's my cake. If he wanted to have a cake with me, he could have gotten me one on my birthday.\n\nHe then exclaims \"So you're just gonna eat a whole cake?\"\n\nAnd I tell him yes, yes I will, because it's my cake and I can take as long as I want to go through it.\n\nHe told me that this was greedy and that he thinks its unreasonable for me to eat an ENTIRE cake myself. He even told our oldest about it, and my oldest laughed and said \"honestly I'd do the same thing.\"\n\nIdk, I could be the asshole for being greedy and I guess no one should eat an entire cake for themselves...But it's not like I had it all at once, I only had one piece and will take my time getting through the rest.

You're ***SO*** into birthdays that you take it as a slight that your husband don't care about them (I'm the exact same way as your husband, except I refuse parties, and ask to be left alone, and often just get myself a hotel room to basically just relax and have some peace and quiet; my wife ***LOVES*** birthdays, so we make a huge fuss on hers and our daughter's).\n2. You're ***SO*** bent out of shape by the \"asymmetry\" of the birthday situation that you wouldn't plan your own birthday thing--even though you seem to love it--and wouldn't bother including your family on your own celebration, to the point of being so petty as to deny them even a slice of your cake--which you are perfectly entitled--though laughably--to do.\n3. Your husband didn't bother getting you a cake, but is indignant that you're going to eat a whole one.\n4. Your actions are frankly odd.  I assume that your husband has toys or sporting gear that he shares with your boys, even though he bought it himself, and the boys don't help.  Whether that's an X-Box or a tennis racquet.  By your logic, your husband shouldn't share those things under the premise that if they wanted to play tennis with him, they should have bought a racquet--or their own TV and X-Box.\n\nHere's what I really think.\n\nI think you want people to be into ***YOUR*** birthday.  I think you want a day where you get to feel super-special.  Which is fine.  But let's not pretend like what you did was anywhere in the same zip code as \"normal\".  Sure, you're entitled.  I could get a giant pizza and eat it all myself, and I could buy a giant hard-drive to store all my Blu-ray rips, and not let anyone else watch it.  I mean, my money, my choice, right?  But that's weird.  The entire point is that the family benefits from everyone's actions--especially mom and dad's actions.\n\nI also think you're using this insane birthday excuse to 1) eat a cake, and 2) be petty toward your family.  If you cared this much, why be passive aggressive about it?  Your husband--and children--should be considerate enough to do what you want for your birthday.  And if that's have a big thing, then they should do it.  If he doesn't do it for yours--but accepts parties you throw him, then he's an asshole.  But, why not just use \"grownup words\" and say: \"Ed, look, I want a ltitle fanfare for my birthday.  Let's at least do cake and a card and 1 special thing that you and the boys plan,\" or whatever it is that you actually want.\n\nWhy be passive aggressive and eat an entire cake on your own (isn't part of the fun of a birthday cake the sharing, and not just the eating)?  Isn't eating that entire thing on your own just a reminder--every time you take a bite--that your family doesn't care about your birthday?  Why not just ask for what you want?", "ESH why are you hiding stuff from your husband? That's toxic. He is an ass for not doing more for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You do some things for your partner even if you don't believe in it. If he cared about you, he would try. He is doing it because he is lazy and can't be bothered to put in the effort. \n\n He could even just give you a kiss and wish you a happy birthday?", "my partner has the same attitude about holidays. he doesn\u2019t like being told to give a gift on a specific day and would much rather just give people gifts spontaneously throughout the year, which he does.\n\nHOWEVER, he also gets me gifts on holidays and my birthday, because he knows it\u2019s important and means a lot to me.\n\nyour husband couldn\u2019t even be bothered to tell you happy birthday. he is not a good partner. NTA", "Honey. That isnt a compromise. That's him getting all benefit and you getting none. A MINIMUM would be him acknowledging your birthday with a cake and a card. A compromise would be him arranging a family dinner and making a bit of a fuss over you.", "You respect what\u2019s important to him, and you accommodate his preferences, which is great.\n\nDoesn\u2019t sound like he makes any effort to respect what\u2019s important to you or accommodate *your* preferences, though. Not even when it comes to your cake.", "I just learned the correct phrase and it made a lot more sense to me. I just thought it was interesting.", "I came here to say this. I had a partner who truly hated birthday celebrations and gift giving occasions. Our compromise was that I wouldn't do anything got him on those days and I didn't expect anything from him, either. But he was aware enough of societal norms and cared enough about me that he would still do for me on those days. I still planned my birthday dinners out but he always had birthday wishes and gifts. Valentines day and Christmas, too. Even mothers day even though he isn't the father of my children. In return, I get him something he really needs or wants but usually don't even wrap it, I don't do a card and I don't plan parties for him because he doesn't want those things.", "Yes, it tells me that the person who takes on the emotional load of ensuring that everyone they love is taken care of and celebrated had no one to take on the emotional load of caring for them. Children can be excused if they haven't been responsible for planning anything themselves before, but the partner has no excuse. \n\nIt often happens that the \"glue\" gets forgotten and left out.", "Lmao, no one ever has a secret stash of snacks or ritual they follow to get their favorite treats? She doesn't lie to her husband about the cake, she just chose not to share it. Would you have a problem with her getting a bag of snack sized candies and putting them away where others won't see them? What about some chips? Where do you draw the line?", "It\u2019s\u2026cake. For her birthday that he didn\u2019t even acknowledge.", "For a while the wife and I were getting ice cream cakes randomly, they\u2019re so damn good. I still want one, but I\u2019ve gotten rounder so I\u2019m trying to resist temptation.", "No worries!", "Choosing to take on a load that people have repeatedly asked you not to is a poor use of energy.", "I'm sad to say I have to agree with you. I like artichokes on pizza and I like pineapple on pizza, but both together just doesn't work. Artichokes are savoury and go great on vegetarian pizza, but pineapple is sweet so you need sweet things like ham and mozzarella with it.", "I don't disagree that she should stop writing about helping him celebrate his other family members, but not giving the kids presents and parties is a bit ridiculous. I think she should stop celebrating him, but this is something she has apparently discussed with him repeatedly and said it's important to get and he refuses to step up and show her that he cares about her.  He also apparently hasn't said \"stop throwing parties for me\". Regardless, it was implied that she has to be uber annoying in order for everyone to forget her birthday, but that's truly not the case. Many people who generally do the planning often find that they get forgotten.", "That's fair. I'll agree to that."]}
