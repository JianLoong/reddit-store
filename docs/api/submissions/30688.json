But the main AH here is OP\u2019s brother because he should also be shouldering ideas and being active in gift giving, not leaving it to his wife. The should have just kept quiet and accept the gesture remark is also out of line. He\u2019s been appreciating the thought gift gesture of his sister for years without any regards in return for OP or the husband.
