If it is so bad...\n\nNTA but i would skip that every time without regret.\n\nEdit. Let your husband go and have his fun. Just because you don't want to, does not kean he cannot go.\n\nAnd maybe have a good conversation about it. Maybe even get couples counseling..", "NAH. Your feelings and reasoning sound good, but Reddit cannot make your husband agree.\n\nIf you agree to go anyway, please consider several scenarios and exit strategies with your husband in advance, so that you can bail early if things start to go sideways.\n\nOr maybe this is a hill to stand on. It doesn't sound epically bad just yet, but you would know better than us.\n\nBy the way, your husband is actually highly confrontational. He likes conflict. It's just that he likes it with you."]}
