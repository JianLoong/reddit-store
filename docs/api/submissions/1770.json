I use her full name because that's the name her dad and I gave her and I don't consider the nickname her real name. But when I introduce her, she'll immediately correct me like I called her a dirty word or something. Then she acts cold and distant toward me.\n\nIt's really embarassing because whoever I'm trying to introduce her to sees her disrespecting me like that and it puts a damper on the whole mood.\n\nIt happened again today and I'd finally had enough. I told her to drop the attitude and stop disrespecting me over nothing.\n\nShe rolled her eyes, said \"Jesus Christ\" (which she knows I hate because I'm Catholic) and then walked away from us and waited in the car. I was mortified and ended up crying in the bathroom.\n\nI love my daughter but I'm at my wit's end here.\n\nI don't see anything wrong with introducing her by her real name and I think she's being oversensitive and rude.\n\nBut, my friend says I should see what other people think.

I am 36, and go by my middle name, I absolutely despise my first name. I used my middle name all through high school, I use it in my profession. It is my identity. My parents REFUSE to use my middle name, and even at my age I find it the most obnoxious and self centered take that \"I gave you your name, I'll call you what I want\"\n\nI imagine your daughter feels similarly. If this is the hill you decide to die on, please be prepared for her to resent you for it. You're choosing to not respect her as an individual. She is now at an age where she is able to make her own decisions and have a level of autonomy, and you're basically telling her \"I have no respect for the decisions you make for yourself\"", "YTA. How about I rephrase this as your daughter may routinely experience it, \u201cMy mom refuses to acknowledge that I have a preferred name I want people to use, it\u2019s a version of my full name but it feels better to me. Every time my mom introduces me to new people she purposefully uses my full name, despite me correcting her repeatedly. It\u2019s embarrassing, because whoever she\u2019s introducing me to see how little my mom respects me and it puts a damper on everything because she then acts upset when I\u2019ve repeatedly corrected her.\u201d\n\nA name is a *gift* given from love, if it doesn\u2019t fit the person they\u2019re allowed to exchange it for one that does fit. If the person/people who gave them the gift truly loves them they\u2019ll want that person to have one that feels right to them.\n\nStop being an over-controlling AH to your child. I have two children, one of whom experiments with new nicknames quite often. I just ask that they remind me what they want me to call them. Respect is earned, not something you get to demand. Your child is a person with their own identity and that deserves respect as well.\n\nETA: Thank you for the awards. I hope OP can see how many of us understand that her behavior is what needs to be addressed.", "YTA\n\nYou are concerned about the \"appearance\" of respect but you aren't extending your daughter the respect of using the name she prefers.\n\nIf your name is Susan and I insist on calling you Sue based on some made up preference of mine, that would be rude, right?", "YTA, definitely.  When I was around 45 I went through a divorce and decided to go by a shortened version of my middle name.

You know what a nickname is and you have used nicknames and you don't have a problem with nicknames. I suspect that you have some sort of problem with her particular nickname (maybe it's more masculine or gender neutral, or you consider it \"trashy\"?) and are using this \"ooh but it's not her REAL name\". \n\nYou're being needlessly hurtful and disrespectful to your daughter, but you seem not to be bothered by that, so here's something that you might care about: You are embarrassing yourself.

Cuz , y\u2019know , \u2018Mom\u2019 is really just a nickname, right?  YTA.  Our name and how we are addressed is important. By introducing her as Rebecca instead of Becky not only reinforces the fact that her sense of self is unimportant to you but also directs others in how to address her by a name you know she does not prefer.

It's honestly more my name now then the name my parents gave me.  I still let them call me by old name it doesn't bother me, but its not what I'm called by everyone else I know.  \n\nThe only thing your daughter did wrong is she should've said \"Jesus H Christ\", missed opportunity there.", "INFO: Is her preferred name gender neutral?

If you keep this up, there may come a day when she goes no contact with you. Are you ready for that eventuality?", "YTA. That may be her legal name but, remember, she had no say in that name that you picked for her. She may be getting teased or have any number of reasons to not want to use her full name.

Imagine how she feels having to listen to you disrespecting her boundaries day after day.. i guarantee that SHE\u2019S at her wits end. \n\nIf you can\u2019t manage to respect a simple boundary, like introducing your daughter by her nickname, then I hate to think what other boundaries you ignore and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your daughter goes low/no contact at 18.

That\u2019s what my grandparents call me. But my parents anglicized it when we moved. And then all the kids called me my name. \n\nI get that it\u2019s the opposite of what you\u2019re describing, but it\u2019s also the same. Because my parents didn\u2019t fight it. They let me go by my actual name because I chose it. \n\nSo now I respond to both.  And I\u2019m good with both. But I really wish I was only the version I prefer.

You chose her name before she could choose. And she now has the choice to make and chooses another version of it. It\u2019s HER name.

(Fake name but you get the idea.)\n\nI don't mind that she does that, but I'm getting tired of the way she corrects me when I introduce her. I use her full name because that's the name her dad and I gave her and I don't consider the nickname her real name. But when I introduce her, she'll immediately correct me like I called her a dirty word or something. Then she acts cold and distant toward me.\n\nIt's really embarassing because whoever I'm trying to introduce her to sees her disrespecting me like that and it puts a damper on the whole mood.\n\nIt happened again today and I'd finally had enough. I told her to drop the attitude and stop disrespecting me over nothing.\n\nShe rolled her eyes, said \"Jesus Christ\" (which she knows I hate because I'm Catholic) and then walked away from us and waited in the car. I was mortified and ended up crying in the bathroom.\n\nI love my daughter but I'm at my wit's end here.\n\nI don't see anything wrong with introducing her by her real name and I think she's being oversensitive and rude.\n\nBut, my friend says I should see what other people think.

Imagine if she kept introducing you by a longer or shorter version of your name then scolded you when you corrected her.\n\nIt would be so *easy* for you to just introduce her by the name she prefers, its weird that you won't, and childish to act upset after you refuse and like she is harming you when really it's the other way round.", "YTA.

You two really need to actually talk things out - and *listen* to each other - rather than communication via passive aggression. It sounds like this is the tip of the iceberg to me.

I only had to mention it to her once in passing that I don't like other people calling me or knowing me by my pet name. She started introducing me as my name immediately. \n\nIt's not that hard to simply be considerate of others, especially if that person is your own kid. There's no need to bring religion or your preferences in there. Your kid prefers it one way, you do it that way. It's that simple.", "YTA - you\u2019ve got this all wrong OP.

If you say that, she will see you are respecting her preferences and there will be no more of the said drama.", "NTA. You gotta learn how to control your kid.", "NAH\n\nI understand why you're so upset. With your daughter refusing to acknowledge the name you gave her, it makes you feel like you're looking at an entirely different person to the one you raised. The name you chose had meaning and symbolism, and her rejecting it makes you feel like she's refusing the past you shared and the many, many times you said her name when what you really meant was, \"My love.\" Now she has a new name and an attitude to go with it, she's not your little baby anymore, and it feels like she doesn't even love you, because she absolutely refuses to realise that her name means, \"My love\" to you.\n\nI'll lay money that your daughter has recently hit her teens, am I right?\n\nI'm sorry, but this was always going to happen. At a certain point your daughter was going to begin the process of transformation into her own person, an adult, and for some people, the process of building their individuality means taking a new name. A girl I went to high school with insisted on being called 'Spud' her entire time there. A boy, his name was 'Nob.' I have no idea why they chose these monikers, but even the teachers called them by their desired names. (I did not keep contact with any of my classmates, so I don't know if they continued to be called so after HS was over. One would hope not.) \n\nYour daughter is beginning to be her own person and yes, she is showing you disrespect and yes, she is pushing back at the identity she's had before now. This was always going to happen and it's perfectly natural to be upset and feel like she no longer cares about you or the past you've spent together. Teenagers are selfish little shits. I'm afraid you've got some years of this to go, so buckle up. But at the same time, you have to allow her to move on to the next phase of her life, and in the next phase of her life, what is important to her is being known by a nickname. If you want peace in the house, you're going to have to accept it, whether it's temporary or permanent.\n\nIt could be worse. She could be running around town introducing herself to all and sundry as 'Potato Chip Monster'. \n\nMaybe this is the time for you to start socialising more with others your own age, if you don't do that already. This is not only a new phase in your daughter's life, it's a new phase in your own.\n\nBest wishes to both you and your daughter.", "Yta.
