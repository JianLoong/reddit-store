I use her full name because that's the name her dad and I gave her and I don't consider the nickname her real name. But when I introduce her, she'll immediately correct me like I called her a dirty word or something. Then she acts cold and distant toward me.\n\nIt's really embarassing because whoever I'm trying to introduce her to sees her disrespecting me like that and it puts a damper on the whole mood.\n\nIt happened again today and I'd finally had enough. I told her to drop the attitude and stop disrespecting me over nothing.\n\nShe rolled her eyes, said \"Jesus Christ\" (which she knows I hate because I'm Catholic) and then walked away from us and waited in the car. I was mortified and ended up crying in the bathroom.\n\nI love my daughter but I'm at my wit's end here.\n\nI don't see anything wrong with introducing her by her real name and I think she's being oversensitive and rude.\n\nBut, my friend says I should see what other people think.

I am 36, and go by my middle name, I absolutely despise my first name. I used my middle name all through high school, I use it in my profession. It is my identity. My parents REFUSE to use my middle name, and even at my age I find it the most obnoxious and self centered take that \"I gave you your name, I'll call you what I want\"\n\nI imagine your daughter feels similarly. If this is the hill you decide to die on, please be prepared for her to resent you for it. You're choosing to not respect her as an individual. She is now at an age where she is able to make her own decisions and have a level of autonomy, and you're basically telling her \"I have no respect for the decisions you make for yourself\"", "YTA. How about I rephrase this as your daughter may routinely experience it, \u201cMy mom refuses to acknowledge that I have a preferred name I want people to use, it\u2019s a version of my full name but it feels better to me. Every time my mom introduces me to new people she purposefully uses my full name, despite me correcting her repeatedly. It\u2019s embarrassing, because whoever she\u2019s introducing me to see how little my mom respects me and it puts a damper on everything because she then acts upset when I\u2019ve repeatedly corrected her.\u201d\n\nA name is a *gift* given from love, if it doesn\u2019t fit the person they\u2019re allowed to exchange it for one that does fit. If the person/people who gave them the gift truly loves them they\u2019ll want that person to have one that feels right to them.\n\nStop being an over-controlling AH to your child. I have two children, one of whom experiments with new nicknames quite often. I just ask that they remind me what they want me to call them. Respect is earned, not something you get to demand. Your child is a person with their own identity and that deserves respect as well.", "YTA\n\nYou are concerned about the \"appearance\" of respect but you aren't extending your daughter the respect of using the name she prefers.\n\nIf your name is Susan and I insist on calling you Sue based on some made up preference of mine, that would be rude, right?", "YTA, definitely.  When I was around 45 I went through a divorce and decided to go by a shortened version of my middle name.  My mom still calls me by my first name which I don't have a problem with, but she always introduces me by my middle name.  Always. It's now been 10 years.

You introduce people by the name they prefer to be called. That's because a big part of introducing people is letting them know what to call each other! This is literally the most basic etiquette.\n\nIt's painfully obvious that you don't like the nickname that your daughter chose for herself, so you're introducing her with her full name as a *power play* in order to get other people to *call her by the name she dislikes*, putting both of them in an awkward and upsetting situation.\n\nNicknames are absurdly common. You know what a nickname is and you have used nicknames and you don't have a problem with nicknames. I suspect that you have some sort of problem with her particular nickname (maybe it's more masculine or gender neutral, or you consider it \"trashy\"?) and are using this \"ooh but it's not her REAL name\". \n\nYou're being needlessly hurtful and disrespectful to your daughter, but you seem not to be bothered by that, so here's something that you might care about: You are embarrassing yourself. When you introduce her by the wrong name and she corrects you, it's not embarrassing because she's \"disrespectful\" to you - it's embarrassing because it becomes clear that *you are being disrespectful to both parties.*", "YTA.

People use other names all the time. You see it as her disrespecting you in front of company, but she sees it as *you* disrespecting *her*  because you refuse to use the name she identifies with.

Cuz , y\u2019know , \u2018Mom\u2019 is really just a nickname, right?  YTA.  Our name and how we are addressed is important. By introducing her as Rebecca instead of Becky not only reinforces the fact that her sense of self is unimportant to you but also directs others in how to address her by a name you know she does not prefer. Keep it up and in the future you can use the name you gave her that you prefer every time you explain that you have a daughter who no longer is in contact with you.", "YTA, why don't you introduce her by the name she goes by.  It's her name I think she can decide if its real or not.\n\nHeck outside of family and a few people from way back in my past everyone else knows me by my nickname.  It's honestly more my name now then the name my parents gave me.  I still let them call me by old name it doesn't bother me, but its not what I'm called by everyone else I know.  \n\nThe only thing your daughter did wrong is she should've said \"Jesus H Christ\", missed opportunity there.", "INFO: Is her preferred name gender neutral? Or possibly skews masculine? Are you deliberately misgendering your child and refusing to accept them?", "YTA, 100%.\n\nA name is a very important thing to us all. You chose one for her, but that doesn't mean it's what she wants to go by. She prefers her nickname, and you intentionally use the name she doesn't prefer, ignoring her wishes and desires.\n\nIt's disrespectful and shows that you don't listen to her, or care about how she feels on the subject. If you keep this up, there may come a day when she goes no contact with you. Are you ready for that eventuality?", "YTA. That may be her legal name but, remember, she had no say in that name that you picked for her. She may be getting teased or have any number of reasons to not want to use her full name. It would be better to introduce her as your daughter and allow her to state her name to the person.", "YTA mom. Your daughter's preferred name IS HER IDENTITY. Call her what she wants to be called, not what you think she should be called. Get a clue and get over yourself.", "YTA.  She's her own person, with a preference for how she wants to be addressed.

This was really enough to make you cry in the bathroom? Imagine how she feels having to listen to you disrespecting her boundaries day after day.. i guarantee that SHE\u2019S at her wits end. \n\nIf you can\u2019t manage to respect a simple boundary, like introducing your daughter by her nickname, then I hate to think what other boundaries you ignore and wouldn\u2019t be surprised if your daughter goes low/no contact at 18.

That\u2019s what my grandparents call me. But my parents anglicized it when we moved. And then all the kids called me my name. \n\nI get that it\u2019s the opposite of what you\u2019re describing, but it\u2019s also the same. Because my parents didn\u2019t fight it. They let me go by my actual name because I chose it. \n\nSo now I respond to both.  And I\u2019m good with both. But I really wish I was only the version I prefer.

You chose her name before she could choose. And she now has the choice to make and chooses another version of it. It\u2019s HER name. You gave the gift of a name and you were close but not quite there. But it isn\u2019t your name. It\u2019s not your pride, even though you\u2019re making it that. You\u2019re being very selfish here.

Because you introduce your daughter as Rebecca to a group then continue with your day. She has to make clear to everyone in that group that she does not go by Rebecca. Then there are inane follow-up questions, and there are only so many times someone can answer those before losing their mind. I speak from experience, although with a reverse of your problem. I go by a name like Rebecca and everyone plays the \"Let's Call You Anything BUT Your Name\" game e.g. Becky, Becca, Becks, Beckers, Beckham, Beckingham Palace, etc, etc, ad nauseam.

(Fake name but you get the idea.)\n\nI don't mind that she does that, but I'm getting tired of the way she corrects me when I introduce her. I use her full name because that's the name her dad and I gave her and I don't consider the nickname her real name. But when I introduce her, she'll immediately correct me like I called her a dirty word or something. Then she acts cold and distant toward me.\n\nIt's really embarassing because whoever I'm trying to introduce her to sees her disrespecting me like that and it puts a damper on the whole mood.\n\nIt happened again today and I'd finally had enough. I told her to drop the attitude and stop disrespecting me over nothing.\n\nShe rolled her eyes, said \"Jesus Christ\" (which she knows I hate because I'm Catholic) and then walked away from us and waited in the car. I was mortified and ended up crying in the bathroom.\n\nI love my daughter but I'm at my wit's end here.\n\nI don't see anything wrong with introducing her by her real name and I think she's being oversensitive and rude.\n\nBut, my friend says I should see what other people think. So here I am.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You're the one who prefers your married name.\n\nI'm sure you're thinking, \"That's completely different!\"\n\nNo.  It's not.\n\nIt's all about respecting someone's personal choices.

Imagine if she kept introducing you by a longer or shorter version of your name then scolded you when you corrected her.\n\nIt would be so *easy* for you to just introduce her by the name she prefers, its weird that you won't, and childish to act upset after you refuse and like she is harming you when really it's the other way round.", "YTA.

It does not feel like mine.\n\nShe can choose whatever she wants to be referred to and you have zero say in it. \n\nHow hard is it to call her by what she prefers? You're being spiteful and petty by insisting on calling her by a name she clearly doesn't like and then when she says something that upsets you, you cry and she's the bad guy?\n\nHere's a wild idea: show respect instead of demanding it.

I have never gone by it and had a shortened version when I was young then added a couple letters around the time I was 12.

My mother, up until maybe 6 years ago would use my legal name when\u2019s her introduce me to people and it drove me mad.

Let us assume your daughters name is Rebecca but you always shorten it to Becca when introducing her and she always corrects you and says \"No, I prefer the full version of the name\". Would she still be in the wrong there for having a preference as to what she was called?

I have a daughter the same age, we used a nickname for her until she asked to go by her full name.", "My daughter and I had an argument over her name.  Just stop there.  It is HER name, not yours.  She can do with it what ever she wants to.  She can shorten it, embellish it, change it.  You can of course choose to ignore her choice.  That makes YTA.  You are being a idiot if you can't see that, and you seem to forget your daughter, whom I am sure you love, is a person in her own right.  Stop being oversensitive and rude.", "YTA. You know she prefers the nickname. You know she doesn't like being introduced with the full name. And yet you continue to do the thing she hates, because you feel ownership over her identity. I'm sorry, but you don't own her identity or her life. \n\nThis is gift protocol: you gifted her a name when she was born, and now it's up to her what she does with it. \n\nAlso? You two really need to actually talk things out - and *listen* to each other - rather than communication via passive aggression. It sounds like this is the tip of the iceberg to me.

This is the bit that confirms you are TA. It is incredibly hypocritical to get angry at people for disrespecting you when you started it by disrespecting them. Any embarrassment you feel is your conscience trying to tell you to stop being mean to your daughter in front of other people. You wouldn't have to be embarrassed if you didn't force her to correct you every single time and actually introduced her by the name she wants people to use.", "Yta let\u2019s start at square one. In order to get respect you have to give it.  Your daughter obviously prefers her shortened version. Call her that.", "YTA. I wonder if this is more about you not accepting your child's name because maybe it is away to affirm their preferred gender. My oldest child has a preferred named, and since I was told this, that is their name. The end.", "YTA: When you introduce someone, you are supposed to use the name they will want the other person to call them. It\u2019s about them, not you.", "I'm gonna go out on a limb here and assume what you're upset about isn't her name.\n\nIf *it is* about her name then get over yourself and learn that respect is a two way street and you've put traffic cones on your end by refusing to capitulate to something so incredibly *unimportant*", "What a weird thing to power trip over..... Like why? \n\nMy mom is a normal parent, she has her faults and positives like every other human. She used to introduce me to people by my pet name because it was just one syllable (and I could pronounce it easily when I was kid, and that habit stuck). I only had to mention it to her once in passing that I don't like other people calling me or knowing me by my pet name. She started introducing me as my name immediately. \n\nIt's not that hard to simply be considerate of others, especially if that person is your own kid. There's no need to bring religion or your preferences in there. Your kid prefers it one way, you do it that way. It's that simple.", "YTA - you\u2019ve got this all wrong OP. She is not disrespecting you by asking to be addressed & introduced by her chosen name - you are disrespecting her by repeatedly refusing to respect her wishes.\n\nIs this really the hill you wish to see your relationship with her die on?", "Maybe introduce her as her full name and add \u201cbut she prefers to go by\u2026.\u201d That way you both get your way.", "NTA my husband says the only two ppl who can call him by his full name are the woman he came out of and the woman he comes in", "YTA.

Try giving her some respect if you\u2019d like some in return.", "Imo, the kid is being overly dramatic. Just say her name is this but she goes by this name or prefers to be called that name. If you say that, she will see you are respecting her preferences and there will be no more of the said drama.", "NTA. You gotta learn how to control your kid.", "NAH\n\nI understand why you're so upset. With your daughter refusing to acknowledge the name you gave her, it makes you feel like you're looking at an entirely different person to the one you raised. The name you chose had meaning and symbolism, and her rejecting it makes you feel like she's refusing the past you shared and the many, many times you said her name when what you really meant was, \"My love.\" Now she has a new name and an attitude to go with it, she's not your little baby anymore, and it feels like she doesn't even love you, because she absolutely refuses to realise that her name means, \"My love\" to you.\n\nI'll lay money that your daughter has recently hit her teens, am I right?\n\nI'm sorry, but this was always going to happen. At a certain point your daughter was going to begin the process of transformation into her own person, an adult, and for some people, the process of building their individuality means taking a new name. A girl I went to high school with insisted on being called 'Spud' her entire time there. A boy, his name was 'Nob.' I have no idea why they chose these monikers, but even the teachers called them by their desired names. (I did not keep contact with any of my classmates, so I don't know if they continued to be called so after HS was over. One would hope not.) \n\nYour daughter is beginning to be her own person and yes, she is showing you disrespect and yes, she is pushing back at the identity she's had before now. This was always going to happen and it's perfectly natural to be upset and feel like she no longer cares about you or the past you've spent together. Teenagers are selfish little shits. I'm afraid you've got some years of this to go, so buckle up. But at the same time, you have to allow her to move on to the next phase of her life, and in the next phase of her life, what is important to her is being known by a nickname. If you want peace in the house, you're going to have to accept it, whether it's temporary or permanent.\n\nIt could be worse. She could be running around town introducing herself to all and sundry as 'Potato Chip Monster'. \n\nMaybe this is the time for you to start socialising more with others your own age, if you don't do that already. This is not only a new phase in your daughter's life, it's a new phase in your own.\n\nBest wishes to both you and your daughter.", "Yta. If your daughter likes the nick name there shouldn't be anything wrong with her using it. Yes you and her dad picked her name but you don't own it. Stop being do controlling over something so small.", "Yta", "Yta. My daughter does not use her full name either. I admit, after calling her by the name i gave her for her entire life, its hard. Very hard to call her something else. My daughter has a legit reason she doesn't want to use her name & i try to respect that. I do slip up every now & then but not on purpose.
