Before that I lived primarily with her and saw my father one weekend a month because he lived several hours from me. He's been married to Charlotte for years and they have six kids under the age of 10. When mom died I moved in with them unfortunately and life became pretty rough. I'm atheist and Charlotte and my father are some kind of Christian's. They go to this small church where there's a big emphasis on everyone taking part. I am forced to attend. But recently I was asked not to come back because I don't pray, I don't engage in services and was also not involved in the youth service stuff they had for kids and teens. They don't like having someone who never prays so my father was told it was best if I didn't return.\n\nCharlotte is pissed. She is not okay with me living with them and not attending and she told me to pray. I told her no. I told her I have never prayed a day in my life and I won't start just for her. She told me I am setting a bad example for her children and I told her I didn't care, that her beliefs are not mine and I'm not sitting there talking to myself or addressing someone I don't believe in. I told her she can't make me religious and the sooner she accepts that the better.\n\nShe told me I was a sinner and I should be ashamed of myself for speaking to her and about the family religion that way.\n\nAITA?\n\nMy father and I are not close.

Forcing one's belief on others is never morally right.

I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re stuck in a household that wants to force their beliefs on you. I mean I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re not rude or disruptive when they pray, you just don\u2018t participate? Losing your mom is hard enough but being forced into a home like that must make it so much harder. I hope you can get out of there soon.", "Nta. You are 16. You are old enough to stay home from church alone. Maybe see if your grandparents are willing to take you in. Are there any aunts or uncles you could live with?", "NTA. She's the one who is setting a bad example. Trying to use you to help to indoctrinate her children is an awful thing to do. I am very sorry that you are in this situation and that your father is letting you down like this.", "NTA and I\u2019m a Christian.  I\u2019ve never heard of any church asking people not to come for not praying or whatever.  That seems weird to me.  I know there are a lot of churches out there that do things that don\u2019t make sense and pretty much go straight up against what the Bible says thinking they are being Christian. There\u2019s even a story in the Bible about a town full of people getting ready to stone this sinner to death.  Jesus looked at everybody and picked up a rock himself, and he said OK if this is what you guys want to do then who among you has not sinned?  And let this person who has not sinned cast the first stone.  Well nobody could throw a stone.  Also it\u2019s really stupid to tell you that they don\u2019t want you there (for about a million reasons) but whatever.  That\u2019s all beside the point.  \n\nAs far as setting, a bad example to her children, as a Christian, she and your father are the ones that are absolutely setting terrible examples as Christians. Some of the most loving people in my life are atheists, and I often joke that they are the most Christian people I know. \n\nI wonder if you could suggest family therapy? Of course, they would probably want you to go to some Christian therapist who\u2019s not certified in psychology and that won\u2019t help anything. If they have a psychology degree then okay. Might help.\n\nThe problem here has nothing to do with your religion and everything to do with control. Christianity is supposed to be based on love really I tell people there\u2019s only three scriptures that matter if you want to squash this massive teaching down into a nutshell\n\nJohn 3:17 - For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.\n\n1 Corinthians 13:13 Three things will last forever--faith, hope, and love--and the greatest of these is love. \n\nAnd finally \n\n1 John 4:16. And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them.\n\nSo you can see - living in love seems more important than having faith \n\nAnd so many Christians like to gloss over this and get crazy legalistic.  I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if I get people arguing with me in here on it. \n\nAnyway, I just point that out to say that your stepmom is being an absolute hypocrite, and she needs to understand that. Even in her own faith, she is not upholding the tenants of that faith. So she is lying about who she is essentially.", "NTA, you have every right to believe or not believe in whatever you want. If Charlotte's faith is so fragile and she's so worried her brainwashing of her kids will crack bc one person they're around doesn't actively participate, then her faith isn't that strong to begin with (one of the ways I used to troll the Christians I was raised around). It's not like you're going out of your way to bash or disrespect them. \n\nI'd ask your dad if this is how your mom would want her son being treated, and how would she feel about the situation if she was there (sorry for the loss of your mom btw).", "I would call child protective services and get TF out of that scary cult house. Also get a part time job and start saving money.", "NTA.  You have no moral duty to play along with her superstitions.  \n\n>I should be ashamed of myself \n\nBullshit.

I can't imagine how lost you feel without your mother. Someone your age needs a stable parent figure to prepare you for adulthood. It sucks that you don't have that.\n\n2nd, as Christian, my obligation is to love everyone because Christ died for me. I'm sorry your step-mother and her church don't feel that same obligation.\n\nPlease know that your story touched my heart. I don't know you but I love you and will pray for your growth, happiness and success. You being an atheist and not believing in prayer doesn't change anything.\n\nI hope you take these experiences and grow into a strong woman who can respect yourself, love freely and be very successful. Don't let them bring you down. You are worth much more!", "NTA, not even one bit.\n\nIf your father and his wife are the type of people I assume they are, things are not going to be easy on you until you can get out of that house, be prepared. \n\nIf you need to respond between now and when you can escape, remind Charlotte that her asking you to pray is asking you to lie, and the Bible does not look too kindly on lying.", "Maybe consider contacting child and family services through your Department of Social Services. They are forcing their lifestyle and their religion and then shaming you for it. Sounds like your dad is not the primary parent and the step mother emotionally and mentally abusive to you. You\u2019re growing up in a toxic and hostile environment. Maybe you can request to be placed in the foster care until you turn 18. It sounds like it might be better than your current Living environment. If you don\u2019t have any other family and any other options, I know it sounds drastic but they do have places like boarding schools but they\u2019re really more of a conversion camp that, as  your guardians they could force you to go to. It might be worth a phone call. Good luck.", "NTA - her religion tells her what to do, not you. These folks always end up demonstrating the very opposite of unconditional love.", "I'm sorry for your loss and for your current difficult living conditions.\n\nCharlotte may need to be reminded that it is your father's legal responsibility to give you a home, and if she doesn't like it, legally the only option is for HER to leave.  Also she's a b\\*tch but you knew that.\n\nGood luck.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. She knows her kids will probably want to leave the cult too if they see there is a way out.

I tend toward hostility to this type of militancy (and will atone on Yom Kippur) but this church at least has the decency not to want butt in pew if the person isn\u2019t praying.", "NTA\n\nReligions are dangerous nonsense and nobody should be coerced", "NTA - your step mum sounds like a delight. You don\u2019t have to follow her rules.", "NTA, OP and I am sorry you have to endure this two more years. You could ask your step-mom if she will feel better to make you lie that you are praying or when you are honest that you are not praying, but it will just come off as being smart ass and it will get you in more trouble. \n\nThe best thing would be if you lean on the church asking your dad that you don't come again and try not to rub it in her face. Also, OP, I am not sure what the financial situation is, but I would look for some part-time job and start saving money and pushing my grades up (if you are looking to go to college) so you can move out and live on your own terms in future.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
