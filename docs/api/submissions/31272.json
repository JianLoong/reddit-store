On these occasions, I always bring my girlfriend, Sadie (32f) with me and we make it a mini-vacation. I would say I travel maybe 9 times a year and each time is maybe for 5 to 10 days. The company I work for pays for travel, living, and food expenses, anything I don\u2019t use is paid out, but with two of us, we easily use it all. I should also note, I\u2019ve been with this company for nearly 10 years, did schooling through them, and worked hard for my position.\n\nI have a coworker (36F), Sue, who is a mom of 4 kids under the age of 8. Sue has been with the same company for 15 years and as long as I\u2019ve known her, I\u2019ve only considered her an acquaintance. She often gives me grief about not having kids and how I\u2019m \u201clucky\u201d.\n\nThe issue happened a few days ago when I rejected a travel job and Sue begged my boss to let her try. He caved because it was an emergency and I had already scheduled off for Thanksgiving. Sue made all her arrangements and asked if I could watch her kids for the week she\u2019s gone. I told her no, because I\u2019ll be traveling and she told me this will be a great way for me to experience the joy of having children. I told her no; I don\u2019t want to watch her kids because I enjoy my kid-free life and I refuse to travel with kids. We went back and forth a bit before I told her to stop asking me because my decision is final and I won\u2019t compromise Sadie\u2019s trip just because she got a wild hair up her ass to do something she\u2019s not nearly qualified enough to do. I did not tell her the last part, I just said I don\u2019t want to compromise Sadie\u2019s trip because she\u2019s hosting with her mom.\n\nFrom the grapevine, I heard her husband drove their kids an hour to her parent\u2019s house before leaving. A few of my coworkers are saying that I was very cold for not helping her out, since she only wanted to experience what I do. My boss thinks I\u2019m in the right because I shouldn\u2019t compromise the PTO I placed, in advance, months ago for something she planned less than a week ago. Sadie is 50/50, saying she understands that Sue gets under my skin often, but that we could have done the trip with them and survived.AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*\n\nThe reason Sue's husband didn't take the kids is because she invited him to go on the trip with her.

Hahaha... omg, I can't stop laughing!\n\n1. Heck, it doesn't have to be YOU offering Sadie that 'gift'. Any single one of them that believed that rubbish could have given Sadie that gift by offering to watch her kids themselves. Sadie having that experience does not require YOU to do anything.\n2. In FACT, Sadie GOT that experience. She got it by having her parents watch the kids. Driving an hour is not a crazy burden on her/husband so that Sadie and her husband could get a child-free, work-paid work/vacation.\n3. Setting aside the fact that this trip never required you to babysit her kids... IF Sadie NEEDED your babysitting help to be able to have this trip (and thought it was a reasonable/proper/not-entitled or obnoxious thing to ask of you), then WHY DIDN\"T she ask you before begging to go on the trip. Tell you and your boss that she \"needs\" your babysitting support to be able to take this trip? Why does she think it's OK to say she'll do something, then spring a condition on anyone, much less a person who has zero responsibility for this trip?\n\nSadie and her work friends need to be honest. Sadie didn't just want to experience a child-free, work-paid work/vacation. She wanted to MAKE YOU experience her life of caring for children... her children specifically AND during your own personal family vacation.

Do you even know these kids? Why would a mom leave a strange man or couple in care of her children for a week\u2026? Doesn\u2019t matter if you have been working together for a while. It\u2019s also not your fault you chose to be child free. You shouldn\u2019t be punished for it.

You work with her it was inappropriate to ask and i would tell HR the initial request was over stepping the mark but you politely declined.

Wild of her to ask a co-worker to look after her kids who a) she\u2019s not friends with b) has no experience looking after any kids.

From what I understand about the situation with her family, she wants her husband to join me, just like Sadie joins me. I feel that, in the heat of the moment, she wanted me to watch them because we always bicker about me not having kids. I feel that her mom was always the main option, but she wanted to see if I'd do it, or even accept.

She mentioned that maybe it could be a way for Sue and I to be more friendly towards each other, but she honestly thinks it was a test and that, even if I said yes, she wouldn't have left them with me. \n\nAs for them getting sick, I'm so glad I don't have to worry about that now.", "I think Sue wanted him to join her, I asked the same thing to my coworker's and they weren't sure either.", "He\u2019s probably working right?", "I don't think Sue is taking into account that the budget is only for 1 person. When my budget is figured out, we downgrade flights and don't go out to eat at super extravagant places every day. I'm not exactly sure on the math, but they account for like $45 a day for meals and other expenses added in, and if they calculate a 7 day budget, but you go through it in 4 days, you pay the remainder of the trip. It's pretty much a lump sum that's given to you on day one and you just have to make it work.  That's why if it's not all used, it's paid out.", "I respect Sue in a way she'll never respect anyone else. I've respected her as my senior, my mentor, and my colleague, but as soon as I started getting promoted, her resentment towards me started growing and my respect dwindled. I'm still civil towards her, I still talk with her, but I keep my distance because I never know when she's going to blow up. It's been this way for about 3 years and HR doesn't try to intervene since it's mostly just bickering at this point.

I'm not willing to take that bet.", "I wasn't aware that's a subreddit, but thank you for letting me know.", "I have considered just shutting down the conversations, but Sue is so persistent, that it's like stroking a fire with a bundle of matches. She'll just put words in people's mouths. I feel that may have been the reason some of my coworkers thought I was being very cold to her, she more than likely spun it to be more in her favor than how the situation actually unfolded.", "They've been aware of the situation for many years, but nothing has come of it.", "I honestly doubt she'll ask me again, this is the first time she's asked me in the many years I've known her and I feel she only asked out of the heat of a conversation we had in the previous days. I try not to talk to her, we used to get along okay, but that was when I first started.\n\nI've never thrown her having kids in her face, but I have used the fact that she can't eat anything hotter than a harvest cheddar sun chip in her face a few times.", "I've met her kids a few times when they've stopped by and at company dinners, but it's been years, so I know they've grown and probably talk now.", "I'm sorry, a little bit of clarification. I didn't realize that a lot of people thought she meant I'm lucky because I don't have kids. She meant I'm lucky because I have my job and my position.

He said I should taught them to say curse words for a solid week.", "While I don't want kids and never had a desire to have kids, kids are drawn to me because I'm usually their size or shorter. I'm like 4'10, so with enough duct tape and melatonin, I can probably wrangle them together.", "Also\u2026 that is a bunch of young kids to trust a work acquaintance who has no children with?

She must be crazy!! Not to disparage you, but as far as Sue knows you could be involved in any number of horrible things! \nThis doesn\u2019t even deal with how incredibly rude it is to ask this of a coworker who is on Vacation! \nWow, the nerve of some people!! NTA!!!!", "The ones trying to guilt you can look after them then! The nerve of these people!", "Right?! And it seems the coworker doesn't even like OP!", "So *two* less-than-stellar parents. \"Let's dump the kids with my co-worker\" /  \"Do you like her?\" / \"God no, but who cares, it's a break from our brats\"", "I figured that was because he wanted to travel with her", "The father is going on the trip with Sue.

I mean who dumps 4 kids on someone just because they work together. She doesn't know you outside of work, she's a colleague not a friend and to think she'd be happy leaving 4 kids at that age with someone they're not familiar with beggars belief.  OP definitely NTA.", "She is ridiculous to even propose to leave her children with you.", "That makes request all the more strange in my opinion. I would say that if yall were extremely close friends with a strong bond and this was something that had been discussed well beforehand then maybe it would be justified. But otherwise it's just comes across to me as way out line. And I agree with you that it does seem as though she is projecting the state of her life onto yours. Especially her comment about you being lucky you don't have kids and you understanding the joy of motherhood. It's your life to live as you see fit, you choose to live it childfree,  she should accept that and move on. Her life choices are not yours to juggle. If I were you I would reiterate your boundaries to her and create space if possible. It seems like she just harms your harmony.", "Mm, that's interesting. Maybe she feels envious of your work and lifestyle and somewhere during your transactions she felt misunderstood by you. It could be she thinks if you kind of \"trade places\" you'll gain insight into her life. People with kids often have this \"my life is harder than yours\" attitude.\n\nSounds like you handled it really well though.  Good for you, and great that your boss has your back!", "So she wanted to punish you with looking her kids as she envies your lifestyle? So weird.", "Switch places for a week ?

Being child free isn\u2019t lucky. It\u2019s a choice", "Doesn\u2019t sound like anyone else volunteered to take her kids for the week\u2026 just ignore their comments.", "> other's apparently didn't think so\n\nAnd did they leap into action, offering to take the kids?\n\nNo?  I thought not.  So you cann ignore them.", "this kinda confirms my earlier comment that she must be a fairly bad mother if she'd even consider doing this", "There is no reason to evaluate your skills and talents against her overbearing comments to 'prepare to be a parent'. No you don't. She needs to accept and respect your boundaries. She is out of line.", "\"Do not harm, but take no shit\"\n\nI love this!", "I rest my case! she wanted a few days away with hubby at the companies expense and expected OP to baby sit probably for free while OP was on his holiday.\n\nShe wanted the trip without any of the family agro that goes with leaving kids behind.", "Please do, they sure were quick to volunteer you. Also what kind of company do you work for that has this many people who thinks this was a reasonable request and not completely insane?", "Thanks for the clarifications.  I wondered about the post because it seemed so strange so many people thought you should do it or didn're recognise what a bizarre request this was.  This woman sounds like trouble, be utterly professional with her - keep to work topics only and do not engage with discussion of your personal life choices.  You might want to start documenting your interactions with and about her just in case you ever need it.", "Does your company have an HR department? Her commenting on your lack of kids and now trying to force you to babysit is wildly inappropriate in the workplace", "She sounds like a nightmare. At least you get lots of travel so get to avoid her lol", "People accidentally get pregnant like they accidentally run red lights.   They are all at fault.", "Oh, she's testing you alright, shes's testing which of her workmates\ncan be a doormat. You should have told her you were going to a nude camp.\n\nI really don't get what's \"harsh\" about politely saying no. Harsh would be telling her her kids have awful parents that they'd risk dumping four really young kids on someone not even related to them just so she and her husband can go on a roadtrip. \n\nI swear women are too socialized to play nanny to everyone otherwise \"she's not kind.\" Your gf needs to work on that. People will take advantage of her.", "Well it seems like she was every bit trying to hijack both your vacation and your job at the same time. And maybe you should have a talk with your gf, I'm wondering if she's maybe starting to consider not wanting to be child free. Or she could just love kids but not want her own.", "She\u2019s escalated this so maybe time for a proper sit down with your boss and explain you fee unsupported by the business in this matter. Are you in the US? Do you have a hr or union rep?", "Oh yeah, in that case she makes a bit more sense, and my first and second points are not valid, but I still stand by the third point, I don't trust parents that just dump their kids on strangers.", "Oh shit, that would've been incredible...", "Pssst. Not a male coworker.

I did 100% international travel, living out of a suitcase before I had kids. \n\nBit of a shame for Sue if she never experienced that before settling down but she\u2019s a huge AH for taking that out on other people", "But this is clearly starting to affect you and upset you more and more with her unreasonable expectations of you and views on your personal life.
