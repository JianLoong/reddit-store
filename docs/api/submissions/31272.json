On these occasions, I always bring my girlfriend, Sadie (32f) with me and we make it a mini-vacation. I would say I travel maybe 9 times a year and each time is maybe for 5 to 10 days. The company I work for pays for travel, living, and food expenses, anything I don\u2019t use is paid out, but with two of us, we easily use it all. I should also note, I\u2019ve been with this company for nearly 10 years, did schooling through them, and worked hard for my position.\n\nI have a coworker (36F), Sue, who is a mom of 4 kids under the age of 8. Sue has been with the same company for 15 years and as long as I\u2019ve known her, I\u2019ve only considered her an acquaintance. She often gives me grief about not having kids and how I\u2019m \u201clucky\u201d.\n\nThe issue happened a few days ago when I rejected a travel job and Sue begged my boss to let her try. He caved because it was an emergency and I had already scheduled off for Thanksgiving. Sue made all her arrangements and asked if I could watch her kids for the week she\u2019s gone. I told her no, because I\u2019ll be traveling and she told me this will be a great way for me to experience the joy of having children. I told her no; I don\u2019t want to watch her kids because I enjoy my kid-free life and I refuse to travel with kids. We went back and forth a bit before I told her to stop asking me because my decision is final and I won\u2019t compromise Sadie\u2019s trip just because she got a wild hair up her ass to do something she\u2019s not nearly qualified enough to do. I did not tell her the last part, I just said I don\u2019t want to compromise Sadie\u2019s trip because she\u2019s hosting with her mom.\n\nFrom the grapevine, I heard her husband drove their kids an hour to her parent\u2019s house before leaving. A few of my coworkers are saying that I was very cold for not helping her out, since she only wanted to experience what I do. My boss thinks I\u2019m in the right because I shouldn\u2019t compromise the PTO I placed, in advance, months ago for something she planned less than a week ago. Sadie is 50/50, saying she understands that Sue gets under my skin often, but that we could have done the trip with them and survived.AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\*\\*EDIT\\*\\*\n\nThe reason Sue's husband didn't take the kids is because she invited him to go on the trip with her.
