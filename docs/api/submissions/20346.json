You did the right thing and saved yourself some money. I feel bad that the kids have such a shit mother though.", "ESH: \n\nWhat I find really weird here is that you dated for a year but had no idea what she was like. (Not on you per se). You mentioned she let the kids draw on your walls but you never saw drawings on the walls when you went to hers? I\u2019m guessing she was just very depressed when she moved in and had no motivation to do her job of being a parent. ( I empathise but also extremely rude to treat someone\u2019s house that way) \n\nShe\u2019s the asshole because as a parent making sure her kids have a home should be a top priority. And moving into a potential new father figure\u2019s home should not be something that is done on a whim. It should be thoroughly discussed so you can agree on house boundaries for one but also the role you would play into the children\u2019s lives. Were you prepared to be their step dad essentially? It\u2019s crazy to me because she\u2019s the same age as me but she doesn\u2019t seem to have given a lot of thought to her kiddo\u2019s parenting. Not that I have kids, but that\u2019s why, because I don\u2019t feel I could properly take care of them right now in my life. \n\nAs I\u2019ve seen another comment say, there\u2019s no way to kick a single mother and her kids out without being a little bit the asshole. But this was justified assholery imo. Idk how tenancy laws work in your state but in the UK. I\u2019m sure there needs to be a form of consideration (payment) in order for a legal tenancy to be formed. Was the agreement that you were going to live together forever or just until she got back on her feet?\n\nThere seems to be very little that has been discussed and the fact that it seems you barely knew each other seems like a major red flag after a year. \n\nEssentially yeah you were a little bit the asshole, but it was justified and you should feel comfortable with your decision. I disagree with other commenters who have suggested that you could have paid for a hotel. I would have instead made a written agreement that she could stay for 2 more weeks but not as a tenant, as a guest until she found a place and agreed upon some house rules.", "NTA... my suspicious mind wonders if her ex landlord is also an ex partner and if she goes around doing this kind of thing in rotation.

Almost anyone can keep kids in line for a few hours, but tack a couple of extra days onto that, and the reality of how she parented would have come to light quickly. And that's not saying all kids (or even Julia's) are little hellions, it's just that unless you've got a housekeeper and a nanny, life with kids is going to get a little messy and a little chaotic.

So not the typical story and kind of sad actually.", "I was wondering what the answer to this conundrum is and this might be it - I completely understand OP not wanting his gf to have tenant's rights and she would definitely take advantage of it, but as the commenter above says, you can't kick a mother and her children out with no notice at all without being something of an AH. I don't blame him for his actions, but children being homeless isn't something anybody wants to see. \n\nAll around a really shitty situation and I really feel bad for OP. Even if he is a tiny bit of an AH for kicking her out with no notice... he kinda has to be.", "Mate you're 30 and have your own home.

Your town may be small but surely there are other towns around you, and perhaps a bigger city an hour or two away? It might be worth it to try.

I couldn\u2019t understand why such a great guy had such a hard time dating. We dated long distance for a year (about 80 miles between us) seeing each other once or twice a month and moved in together a year ago.

Neither group includes anyone I'd ever want to date. Also, small town mentality is a thing here and unfortunately it's part of the norm for people of all ages to be a bit racist and/or homophobic and I'd rather be single for the rest of my life than date someone with those values.\n\nThe struggle is real.\ud83d\ude44", "I definitely understand that.

Seems like she's had a rough time of it and is just struggling under the weight of things. No wonder she's not doing much in the way of effective parenting. That's not to say you were obligated to have her in your place, but it would at least incline me to try and help find them a place to stay.", "I think that\u2019s what I\u2019m going to have to do tbh, I\u2019m about out of options.
