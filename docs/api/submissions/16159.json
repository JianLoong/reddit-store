How the teacher sold that to get it approved.  The fact you emailed the teacher for clarification of the selection process, for such a broad stem field trip was carried out and got fobbed off by that obtuse statement was disrespectful to say the least.\n\nSince the teacher has made it known they are not approachable over the subject, that leaves you to approach the schools admin with your concerns.  Stem field trips should be open to all.  Lighting the educational spark within students comes from these sort of excursions.  \n\nI suggest your next point of contact is the admin and let them know you raised the same questions with your child\u2019s teacher, but the teacher refused to engage with you.  Let them know of your concerns regarding the select students only field trip, your disappointment that stem field trips aren\u2019t being packaged to all the capable children .

It was always in the beginning of the year and after our talk they came to understand he wasn\u2019t trying to be difficult, he just had an enquiring mind the answer that best suited the situation was extra work for him, which he embraced fully.  \n\nOur youngest always chose the most difficult assignments to undertake when there were options, if he sat a test and thought he could do better he would approach his teachers asking for a redo, with the understanding it was on his own time and he had the potential to be graded worse.  \n\nMy point being for some teachers this made him unpopular with them, not all personalities get in well with each other and some teachers can act very immature for this reason.  \nThis is why as a parent you should find out more about what is going on in your son\u2019s classroom.  Your child doesn\u2019t deserve to be excluded from a stem field trip over personality clashes.", "YWBTA. Seriously, what is your endgame here? Your son knows he wasn\u2019t invited.

I don't know why.\" And you think this scenario will be okay or better than the alternative of him just being in school?", "Wait you are planning to pull him from school, take him to these places, and then drop him off? To hang around the invited kids or just wander around on his own? Because if it\u2019s the former, YTA regardless of the reasons it\u2019s invite only as there are laws/regulations on how many students per adult and your son could be throwing that off making it dangerous", "Your son sounds like a really good kid.

I understand that the teacher\u2019s reply was not informative, so I don\u2019t understand why you didn\u2019t reply to that and CC the principal into it. I also get it that your wife is trying to calmly figure out what\u2019s going on. \n\nOn another note, the teacher needs guidance/correction/reprimand for how she\u2019s organized the field trip. Each parent should\u2019ve received communication regarding why only certain students would be/were invited and that each student in the class was aware of what needed to be done/standards met/whatever in order to be invited.", "Yes they absolutely should be obligated to say that.

Like STEM club or something.", "Thank you. I know not all teachers are fair but this scenario screams club not class to me. But I\u2019d never exclude kids from a class field trip except extremely unmanageable behavior. Or OP has rose colored glasses on when it comes to his kid. I\u2019ve heard my kid is an angel from parents to describe kids that can only be demonic spawns of satan.", "Did you talk about it with her parents? Maybe you should approach this problem together.", "Yeah, but that means OP should be asking for answers. Not planning to bring the son on this field trip before even knowing what's going on.", "Considering how little he's tried to get answers, I kind of wonder if the answer isn't obvious to any involved parent and he's just oblivious. Coming at this from a US perspective... As many problems as we have in the US, I'm having a hard time imaging *this* passing muster in any US school. We make elementary aged kids invite their entire class to birthday parties! How would something like this slip by?

Seems like an intention over an coincidence.", "Remember your kid will feel awkward crashing something he was not invited to.\n\nTake it up with the school administration, don\u2019t put your kid on the spot though.

If it were 50 kids that got invited but not the seven then there\u2019s something going on. Hopefully you can let us know once your wife gets a response back.", "I say go for it. Give the school the middle finger it so richly deserves.", "Exactly if he is a problem at school I\u2019ve never been told.

I really can't think of any other logical reason.

No. Don't use your kid to be petty like this. This will do far more harm than good.\n\nYTA for just pla ning on \"showing up\" anyway, but this whole revenge fantasy you have isn't going to work out for you kid and they WILL resent you for this BS.\n\nUse your energy to find out why a teacher is allowed to do an \"invitaion only\" event during school hours and if the school has approved his selection for inviation criteria.
