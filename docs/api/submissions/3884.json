{"id": 3884, "submission_id": "zbuqi9", "title": "AITA for banning family members from my home after what they did to my daughter?", "selftext": "So a little background information. My (34F) and my husband (35M)'s daughter (13) has always been very sweet and outgoing. For the purpose of this story, we'll call her Sarah. Like I said, Sarah is a wonderful girl, and we love her a lot. Sarah was about 10 when lockdown started, and we would celebrate holidays and events with just the three of us to be safe.\n\nWhen things started becoming safer, we started inviting my family members for holidays, including my two cousins, we'll call them Stecen and Mark. My husband's family lives out of the country, so unfortunately, they haven't been able to come to most events so it's just my family. It's usually my mother, her husband, my brothers, her cousins, and my cousins.\n\nIn the past 9-ish months, I've noticed Sarah coming down for dinner, eating, and then going back to her room. A few weeks ago, before Thanksgiving, I asked her what the problem was, and she had told my that my Mark and Steven and been making her very uncomfortable. They've \"accidentally\" touched her inappropriately, made disgusting comments, and done it all in secret so my husband and I wouldn't notice.\n\nI was enraged by this, since I've had similar experiences at her age as well. I decided to message my cousins that night and say they were no longer welcome in my home with my daughter. The next morning I woke up to messages from them and their parents (also out of the country) calling me a heartless jerk for leaving my own blood to be alone for the holidays. I explained what was happening and said that if their children were so lonely, they could fly in to celebrate with them themselves.\n\nSince then, my aunts, uncles, and brothers have all reached out saying I'm taking things too far by banning them from my home, but I will do whatever I have to in order to protect my daughter. My mother, stepfather, and husband are all on my side, saying they would do the same but I feel a bit guilty because my family has said they won't come for Christmas, Easter, or any future holidays until they are allowed back home. Now, my daughter won't be able to see any of her family. So AITA?\n\n\nEdit:\nMost of the stories I will be posting are from friends and family members of mine that aren't sure what to do as I've mentioned in my bio so advice and reassurance is appreciated", "created_utc": 1670111740, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbuqi9/aita_for_banning_family_members_from_my_home/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It must have been very hard for her to endure it, physically and mentally, and even harder to tell you about it. You\u2019re an awesome parent for noticing that your daughter were not feeling well, and protecting her from those (let\u2019s stay polite) horrible jerks and sexual offenders. \n\nAlso please talk about what happened with your daughter, you don\u2019t need to go in details, but explain her that it\u2019s not her fault, that her cousins had no right to do that to her, that no one have the right to do that to her. And that if she has to endure this kind of things again, to tell you right away so you can take action to protect her ASAP. \nYou can also ask to your daughter if she wants to take some legal action against them (she is the victim, it\u2019s her choice) and if she feels like she would need to talk to a psychologist or any kind of doctor about it. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to talk about it with your parents, because you don\u2019t want to hurt them, so professional help could help ?\n\nAnd lastly, excuse me but what kind of people would enable this kind of behavior ? What kind of family member would side with some guys who sexually assaulted their cousin ? All of those people should seriously seek for some mental help. You made the right choice for banning the cousins from your home, and you should even ban them from your life, and every people siding with them too.
