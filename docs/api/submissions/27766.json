I\u2019m almost embarrassed to admit how uncomfortable it made me. So, I sat up and turned around to ask her to kindly stop. I see that her seat is fully reclined, and she\u2019s slouching to the bottom of her chair with her knees up on my seat. I ask her to kindly stop. She became instantly defensive and angry. She tells me, \u201cNo. I have long legs. If you don\u2019t like it, put your chair up or change seats\u201d. I explained my situation, and she begins cursing me out.

I asked her for assistance, explaining that her knee was in my back, the chair in front of me was fully reclined and broken, and that the passengers were clearly being rude.

I could have said nothing, or asked a stewardess for help but I didn\u2019t want to create drama when I felt it would have been easier to just kindly ask\n\n(2) I believe I could be interpreted as the A because maybe asking someone to stop is incorrect.
