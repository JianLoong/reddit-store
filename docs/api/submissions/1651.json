{"id": 1651, "submission_id": "yo2xeo", "title": "AITA For \u201cBodyshaming\u201d My Family?", "selftext": "I (17F) am the 3rd of 5 children. We have my mom (49F) my dad (50M) my brother (21M) my sister (19F) my younger sister (14F) and the youngest (12F) and they are all obese or overweight. My parents believe that we must be overweight and they insist that skinnier people are evil or trying to brag 24/7. Its all junk food, breakfast, lunch and dinner. They refuse to hear anything else of the topic. They raised us all to take big portions and finish our plate completely, making us all way overweight for our age. \n\n2 years ago, during covid, I realized all the time I felt tired and sick and I looked it up and learned that being as overweight as I was at my age can do that to you and shorten your life. (By the way, please see a proper doctor if you\u2019re concerned for your health.) This scared me put of my mind but I\u2019ve learned not to google my symptoms. Anyways, during 2020-2021 I started working out and eating healthy and I lost maybe 45-50 lbs in 2 1/2 years. \n\nI am much thinner now and since then my family has never let me live it down. They are constantly calling me \u201cskin and bones\u201d or \u201cstick\u201d and other degrading terms. They try to force me to eat more, even when I\u2019m full and when I don\u2019t, they tell me I\u2019m ungrateful and think I\u2019m better than everyone just because I lost weight. I\u2019m not even really thin, I am just way more in shape than I once was. \n\nThe other day my older sister came to visit from college. She entered my room and asked for one of my crop tops to wear out with some hometown friends. I gave one to her, and low and behold, it didn\u2019t fit. She couldn\u2019t get over her her head, and after 5 minutes of trying, she just went berserk. She got angry and yelled at me saying that I set her up and that I was trying to humiliate her. My family heard so now everyone was in my room trying to figure out what was going on. \n\nShe told my parents that I was body shaming her and embarrassing her by giving her my crop top. I tried to explain that she wanted to borrow one, for goodness knows why because we are completely different sizes now. My parents told me that I was a horrible person and sister and called me all sorts of things. My last straw was when they told me that just because I was sick didn\u2019t mean I should try and influence my family too. \n\nI snapped and told them that just because they are fat and unhealthy and can\u2019t get the idea of obesity out of their head doesn\u2019t mean they should take it out on me. i called them jealous and insecure and they called me an AH for body shaming them and that they will never forgive me. I thought I was justified because I feel like they body shamed me first for months, but now I feel kind of bad and I don\u2019t know anymore. AITA?\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people thinking that my family is abusive and I\u2019ve even seen a comment about including CPS???? My family are very close to each other and had little to no disagreements until my weight loss. My parents and siblings are not abusive. Maybe I over exaggerated on the junk food part. I was still angry over what had happened with my sister a few days ago and my family was still giving me looks when I was writing this. We don\u2019t get junk food every single day. But on days when we don\u2019t, my parents say we should take big portions. My family is fine y\u2019all please don\u2019t call paw patrol. Also I saw a comment saying how they didn\u2019t understand how I could afford healthy food and a gym membership. Considering I am 17, I do have a job. I do home workouts, eat the salads that my school gives us the option for, and I buy healthy food, make small meals, and eat them outside my house. Friends that know about my family\u2019s disagreeing also help out a little bit. So yeah.\n\nEdit 2: Yall please stop calling my family abusive \ud83d\ude2d I promise we got along so well before all this started. I don\u2019t even know what happened or why they are so mad. I, stupidly, but honestly thought they would be happy for me, but I guess not.", "created_utc": 1667769098, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yo2xeo/aita_for_bodyshaming_my_family/", "score": 134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I never falunted it or showed off. But i did buy new clothes. Not only because i literally had to but because i liked my new body and theres nothing wrong with that. My sister, although she never said anything, was irritated by my weight loss and made comments about how it wouldnt last and so on and so forth. Little things like that. I didnt let it get to me. Some people will want you on their level or beneath them in different aspects of life and when you have a come up in any sort of way it bothers them.

Dare I say there might be an element of jealousy coming from the other members of your family - you have been able to gain healthier habits whilst they\u2019re still stuck in an ongoing loop of whatever drives them to overeat. Feelings have been hurt on both sides. Perhaps when things have cooled down, try and sit down and chat it all out.", "NTA. Make sure you\u2019re taking care of your mental health as well.

Don't throw stones at a glass house and judge them when you can't handle truthful judgements too.", "Nta - as someone who lost a relationship with a family member over this 100% get what u r going through.

Your family is ganging up on you because your recent success with weight loss (congratulations btw) has them feeling bad about themselves.  \n\nIt is really easy to fall into that trap.  Fast food is delicious, convenient and satisfying.  It just also happens to be really unhealthy, especially if you eat it all the time.  But it can be hard to change your eating habits (as I\u2019m sure you know) and when you fail, it can be easier to think it\u2019s simply out of your control, than to believe you just lack the willpower.   Cutting down and \u201cothering\u201d people who don\u2019t seem to have the same struggle is a coping mechanism.  It reinforces the idea that it isn\u2019t something they can change about themselves.  I am not sure if they are jealous of you or not.  But I am confident they believed they had no choice but to be overweight until you lost weight and forced them to see that their worldview was inaccurate.

You where not bodyshamming them. You were and are trying to be as healthy as you can.", "Body shaming is the action or inaction of subjecting someone to humiliation and criticism for their bodily features. The scope of body shaming is wide, and can include, although is not limited to fat-shaming, shaming for thinness, small breasts height-shaming, shaming of hairiness (or lack thereof), of hair-color, body-shape, one's muscularity (or lack thereof), shaming of penis size or breast size, shaming of looks (facial features), and in its broadest sense may even include shaming of tattoos and piercings or diseases that leave a physical mark such as psoriasis.\r  \n\r  \nIn a study of children's film and books regarding messages about the importance of appearance, media targeted toward children were heavily saturated with messages emphasizing attractiveness as an important part of relationships and interpersonal interaction. Among the movies used in the study, two Disney movies contained the highest number of messages about personal beauty. This study also found 64% of the videos studied portrayed obese characters as unattractive, evil, cruel, and unfriendly, and more than half of the portrayals involved the consideration or consumption of food.\r  \n\r  \nSome forms of body shaming have ancient origins in popular superstition, such as discrimination against people with red hair and stereotypes of people with blonde hair. Forms of discrimination may also differ significantly depending on age group. For example, tall preadolescents are sometimes depicted as awkward and can face derogatory pejorative terms such as \"lanky\", despite height being a typically valued characteristic among adults.\r  \n\r  \nSometimes body shaming can extend to a perception that one does not sufficiently display masculinity or femininity. For example, men with wide hips, prominent breasts, or lack of facial hair are sometimes shamed for appearing feminine. Similarly, women can be body shamed for appearing to have a man-bulge, or for having broad shoulders, physical traits that are typically associated with men. Suicide due to body shaming is the fourth leading cause of death in 15\u201319-year-olds. Extensive levels of body shaming can have negative emotional effects, including lowered self-esteem and the development of issues such as eating disorders, anxiety, body image disturbance,body dysmorphic disorder and depression. These depressive effects can worsen especially when people feel their body can not meet social criteria.\r  \n\r  \nthis is why you're the asshole, you fucking asshole", "NTA but you need to wise up.
