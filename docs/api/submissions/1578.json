There would be room for forgiveness if he had tried to repair your relationship with him, but no effort was made.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nDeath doesn\u2019t mean shit. It doesn\u2019t automatically make someone a good person. It doesn\u2019t absolve someone of their wrong doings.\n\nMy biggest issue with death is everyone feels sorry for the person that died no matter how shitty they were.\n\nI once worked at a company with a man who was fired for touching teenage girls (who came in to help with remedial no brain tasks like putting products in plastic moulds). One of the girls was CFO\u2019s daughter. When my ex coworker died i heard that nearly the entire staff roster attended including the CFO. No body like the guy before he started touching the girls and sure as hell nobody liked him after they found out. But he dies and he\u2019s suddenly remembered as an angel on earth.\n\nSorry for the rant i don\u2019t imply your father was anything like my excoworker just want to highlight my issues with an example.", "NTA.....but you know the haters in the family are never going to get off your back. You need to move ahead knowing how badly they're going to treat you. You really need to move away from all of them, to be your best you.", "Tell him that you have a written contract that EXPLICITLY says you were NOT to attend his funeral and since  HE never told you that he regretted it or feelings changed you are going to assume that his wishes have not changed and will not disrespect his wishes and attend. Because it would be disrespectful to your father's wishes and who are they to say that following the wishes  you KNOW your father wanted. HE never reached out as far as you know none of his feelings changed. So you will not attend out of RESPECT for him. Very difficult to argue with the fact as far as you knew he didn't want you there. HE NEVER TOLD YOU that anything changed. Anyone asks why you attend simply my father didn't want me there. It would be disrespectful to go against his wishes. It's really hard to tell someone they're cold hearted for not going to a funeral when they're actually the dead didn't want them there", "NTA - assuming he will have a grave...when/if the time comes when you want to make peace you can visit it - but that is a personal moment for you. \n\nFunerals are man-made concepts - the person who died is literally gone, we are literally saying goodbye to an empty shell. If you don't want to go you don't want to go. He had plenty of time to do the right thing and reach out but he was clearly a coward. Most people die with some sort of regret - that was his. He's gone now and your priority needs to be your own mental health.\n\n Turning up to a funeral because other people are telling you too (and consequently hearing a eulogy celebrating what a 'wonderful' man and 'father' he was)  is not the place for you to make peace. Its performative and disingenuine. Do what you feel is right for you OP.", "NTA.\n\nThere seem to be 2 distinct possibilities here:\n\n1. The guy who went to all the trouble to write up a \"contract\" specifying that he never wanted to see his own kid again, and did not even want said kid at his funeral changed his mind and never told you. Wait, I mean, he asked a other people to express his regrets on his behalf, but never bothered to call/write/hire a skywriting service to tell you any of this himself. In fact, he continued to live just like that document was in force until he died.\n2. The people telling you the above story are lying.\n\nOccam's Razor suggests you go with the latter explanation.", "There must have been some pretty huge problems between you to prompt this whole contract situation. I'm assuming you weren't exactly an angel but realistically that's irrelevant now. \n\nJust make sure you're being completely honest with yourself - by which I mean is this GENUINELY because you don't have any feelings about your father passing, or is it so you can say \"I didn't go because he made me sign a piece of paper saying I wouldnt\"? Think that through, and if you don't want to go, don't go. Make it YOUR choice, not his though.\n\nNTA", "You were TAUGHT how to be cold hearted by the one person who died.  You lost nothing and if dad WERE a man, HE would have apologized to you if HE had wanted to.  Stay where you are, you lost nothing when you signed that contract, and HE died just like he wanted.", "NTA and the rest of your family ain\u2019t shit.", "NTA.\n\n\"Please, OP,  attend the funeral of the parent who disowned you *and put it in writing and got you to sign it* so that we can mentally torture you over something we're in denial about!\"\n\nYehhhh nope.", "Nta he didn't say something out of emotion to regret without thought.  He literally got paper wrote a contract for his kid not to go to the funeral.\n\nThen after years of not writing,  texting, emailing,  phoning to apologize and change things, he died. Last op heard from dad directly was don't attend funeral. \n\nDon't go unless you need some closure. Dad sounds horrible.  I've never heard of anything as cold as that contract. It'd be impossible to rationalize it partially away as it not being fully meant. Its in writing. \n\nPeople will let spoken words get away in accident but that's another  level.", "He made you sign a contract to never contact him again ? NTA . The family didn\u2019t see anything wrong with him doing that in the first place ? But hey they expect you to forgive and forget \u2026 ? Nope . You see there is a thing called phones and Internet . Your father had plenty of opportunities to contact you and he didn\u2019t . That\u2019s horrible he did that . That would be heartbreaking but all the more reason to close the book on that if he made u sign a contract . That\u2019s big time insulting . I wish you peace !", "NTA. It sounds like he never changed his mind at all, and your family all agreed to pretend that he did. They're trying to force you into a post-mortem reconciliation and play Happy Family now that he's not around to stop them.", "NTA. Your \u201cdad\u201d made his decision years ago and made you sign a contract. You are not obligated in the least to be at his funeral. His pride and his ego got in the way of him trying to apologize for his mistake.", "Just don't go there , sis", "NTA  Why is it that the family always show up to guilt the child, and just conveniently forgets they sat on the sidelines while the child was cut off?\n\nThis wasn't an issue your father cared enough about to do anything.  Why should it be any more important to you?", "NTA!"]}
