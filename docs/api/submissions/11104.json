With this in mind, my sister, after getting engaged, asked me if I would do the honor of walking her down the aisle. At first I was elated and so I enthusiastically agreed. Then things quickly changed after my sister realized that my wife was pregnant.\n\nIn the proceeding months my sister made my wife's life hell (who initially had been one of her bridesmaids, but was relatively recently informed that she will not be one). Originally it was fine but as my wife's pregnancy became visible, my sister would at times taunt her and make rude comments towards her. During her bachelorette party (just a few days ago), she even yelled at her because she was ruining her fun by being too distracting and \"not-drinking\" (I kid you not). The ensuing onslaught resulted in my wife being removed as one of her bridesmaids. She even left my PREGNANT wife on the side of the road as my sister made her way to a party planned, in part, by my wife and in a limosine paid for by me.\n\nThis coupled with the fact that she had asked me recently to ask my wife to stay at home, \"because her pregnancy will take attention away from her on her special day\", just broke me. I called her up yesterday, after I found out what she said to my wife, and I told her that I will not be attending the wedding and that she will have to find someone else to walk her down the aisle.\n\nThat's when the calls began. Everyone has been calling me, telling me that I am overreacting and that I am intentionally trying to sabotage her wedding. She even called to yell at me, and told me she had always hated \"that bitch\" while referring to my wife. I told her to fuck off ofc. My mother has been extremely sympathetic towards my wife and she agrees with me. My wife has been crying over this and she has herself received an onslaught of messages.\n\nI blocked all my relatives (except my mother ofc) and am planning a trip to Disneyland for my wife and I on the day of my sister's wedding (as I already booked the days off from work and Disney is where my wife and I went on our first date, when we lived in LA).

Your sister isn\u2019t just a bridezilla, she is an AH. You are a great husband the way you are standing up for your wife!!! Maybe you should block all of the people harassing her on her phone.

Maybe they are birds of a feather (of course, he may not have been told the truth of why you pulled out). \n\nWho leaves a pregnant woman out on a side walk?! And blames her for being a party pooper because she will not drink?! A distraction for showing her bump?

You are to be commended for being loyal to your wife here, and your sister's behavior is just deplorable. The only caution I'd add is, don't escalate the drama by saying anything nasty to--or about--your sister. Just tell your own truth in calm and peaceful words.

If she is siding with you, she may be asked to stay away too!", "NTA, let her experience the consequences of her horrible actions by having to walk down the aisle alone, maybe it'll teach her a lesson about being cruel to your wife.

You treat people badly, you can't be shocked when they avoid you.", "NTA!!!", "NTA, and your sister, unfortunately, sounds absolutely vile. Stay true to your wife, she's your life partner.

She has caused more drama and is ruining her own wedding because she thinks all eyes will be on a bump at her wedding.  It's like she is 5 years old.

This is definitely a character revealing moment for your sister, though. That\u2019s such horrid behavior on her part and I\u2019m embarrassed for her.

If you really and truly want to ruin it for her, tell her that you've changed your mind, apologize profusely, and tell her that you'll be there and then just be a no-show.
