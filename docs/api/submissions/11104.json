Then things quickly changed after my sister realized that my wife was pregnant.\n\nIn the proceeding months my sister made my wife's life hell (who initially had been one of her bridesmaids, but was relatively recently informed that she will not be one). Originally it was fine but as my wife's pregnancy became visible, my sister would at times taunt her and make rude comments towards her. During her bachelorette party (just a few days ago), she even yelled at her because she was ruining her fun by being too distracting and \"not-drinking\" (I kid you not). The ensuing onslaught resulted in my wife being removed as one of her bridesmaids. She even left my PREGNANT wife on the side of the road as my sister made her way to a party planned, in part, by my wife and in a limosine paid for by me.\n\nThis coupled with the fact that she had asked me recently to ask my wife to stay at home, \"because her pregnancy will take attention away from her on her special day\", just broke me. I called her up yesterday, after I found out what she said to my wife, and I told her that I will not be attending the wedding and that she will have to find someone else to walk her down the aisle.\n\nThat's when the calls began. Everyone has been calling me, telling me that I am overreacting and that I am intentionally trying to sabotage her wedding. She even called to yell at me, and told me she had always hated \"that bitch\" while referring to my wife. I told her to fuck off ofc.

Seriously? Your relatives are nonsense.\n\nNTA", "Why did you had sex with your wife the year preceding your sister's wedding? You monster !", "NTA - why is your sister so creepily obsessed with you?", "No you\u2019re definitely NTA! My goodness me - what awful toxic family members you have! I mean, what the heck! \n\nGod help that poor groom who is marrying such a witch - this behaviour is far worse than the usual bridezilla \u2018I don\u2019t want a pregnant bridesmaid\u2019 rubbish! \n\nGood on you for having your wife\u2019s back on this. And good on you for making alternate plans for the wedding day so no one can show up on your doorstep and scream at your wife and literally drag you to the wedding against your will (your description of these vile people makes me think they really might try such a thing)!!\n\nAnd snaps to mum as well, for being a sane family member!", "NTA\n\nThat shiny spine can be seen from space..\nThis is all your sisters doing .. let her enjoy 'her special day'", "NTA. Have a great time at Disneyland.", "NTA. It\u2019s clear she\u2019s being horrifically cruel to your wife because she wants to punish her for being pregnant. You would be participating in your wife\u2019s abuse if you rewarded that behavior by walking her down the aisle. Go to Disneyland, your wife (and sister) deserve it.", "NTA if anyone treated my wife like this while she was pregnant I would\u2019ve have gone scorched earth with them.", "NTA. Your sister was fully out of line and cruel. Not just cruel, but actively evil. There was no reason for any of her behaviour and she would rather shit on your wife than keep a relationship with you? She couldn\u2019t have been so dumb as to not expect a reaction. Send this post to her flying monkeys as well.", "NTA. Your sister has irreparably harmed the relationship with you and your wife. I wouldn\u2019t go anywhere near the wedding and would like go LC in your situation. I\u2019m so sorry you and your wife have to deal with this.", "NTA \n\nWhat a wonderful idea to take your wife to Disney to redo your first date. Enjoy!", "NTA - also I wouldn\u2019t be on talking terms with her for a while (if I was OP)", "NTA\n\nShe sounds psychotic. What the hell was the point of torturing your wife simply because she\u2019s pregnant?", "NTA.  Your sister's behavior is just disturbing.  There is NO way I would attend this wedding.  Her treatment of your wife is completely unacceptable.", "Unless AH in this case means Amazing Husband then NTA.  Curious as to the circumstances of Bridezilla leaving your wife on the side of the road.  Have a great Disney day---- post TONS of pics on social media!!!", "NTA\n\n\nAnd I love the Disneyland idea, but make sure your wife is up to it too. Pregnant ladies have more trouble walking around for long periods of time.", "Yes she tried to bully his wife while being nice to him. \n\nThat\u2019s a double assault because it says to the wife that, I can be rude to you and at the same time I can have a nice relationship with your husband and he won\u2019t do anything about. It\u2019s devaluing a person and trying to rub it in her face. \n\nGlad OP has a spine and stood up for his wife.", "This. So concise.", "I have no idea who can be that way. My nephew was born weeks before my wedding and I asked around to my sisters on the OTHER side if they had a newborn baby outfit that was nice for a wedding just to make my sister feel her baby was included. People held and snuggled him. We all took pictures and he slept. \n\nHaving said that, I hate eyes on me. I was glad for any distraction and I hid in a corner for half of the reception because I felt silly dancing.", "Yeah, don't go into details. \"My wife was banned from the wedding,\" is all he has to say.", "Agreed. I would have skipped my own wedding to spend a week or even weekend at Disney \ud83e\udd23 and I\u2019m happily married. Weddings aren\u2019t as fun as people think it will be. I was done after 4 hours and had to endure 6 more", "I agree on your point. If something happened to wife and baby, people would see sister as the AH. That means the sister is the AH, she just got lucky.", "Disagree. I've seen brides get mad at bridesmaids for getting pregnant because they can no longer wear the chosen dress. It's absolute insanity.", "Not every relationship is worth saving.", "THIS, OP, THIS.\n\nGuaranteed all these people calling and harassing you only got Bridezilla's version of events. Take screenshots, print them out and everyone who has an opinion gets a little packet of Bridezilla's abuse.", "Well how else would you snort coke?", "If she cared about having someone walking her down the aisle she wouldn\u2019t treat your pregnant wife like shit.\n\nShe was hoping she could stick it to her and just be mean to her while being friendly to you. She\u2019s just being a mean girl, plain and simple.\n\nYou have the potential to be TA though. You think that there\u2019s 10% chance that you\u2019re wrong so if you go down that route and let down your wife, then you are 100% TA. \n\nSomeone treats your wife like this and you\u2019re still a bit on the fence as to whether maybe that\u2019s still ok. Insane.", "NTA by *any* stretch of human decency. \n\nIs your sister *that* starved for attention that the idea that people might spend a few minutes congratulating your wife and asking how she's feeling will \"ruin\" her big day?\n\nOr is she accustomed to being the center of attention and needs extra-EXTRA attention of her big day? Any word on how the groom might feel about this? This is his chance to reevaluate and potentially cut his losses. \n\nIt feels like people starting to openly admit that marriage = a highly competitive pageant competition in which all attention must be on the bride and thus no pregnant women are allowed and all bridesmaids must submit to the bride's own standards for their weight/shape, hair, and makeup.", "Anyone who is complaining to OP and his wife should have to answer the question \"Do you think it is perfectly OK to abandon a vulnerable pregnant woman at the side of the road in the dark?\"\n\nAny who say yes to that question OP can go low/no contact with and they don't get to meet the baby.", "Hahaha! I believe you!", "You\u2019re probably right, but I can\u2019t imagine WHAT lies she could possibly have spun to excuse their attitude of attacking a pregnant woman for \u2018ruining\u2019 a wedding because she got pregnant! \n\nEven if bridezilla claimed that the SIL was the one being vile about her pregnancy - saying the wedding should be all about her and she\u2019s better than the bride or something like that - they would still be idiots to believe such a bizarre claim and ATTACK the SIL without even asking her side! \n\nThey\u2019ve known this woman for years, right? The OP\u2019s wife who married into the family, I mean.  Has she ever acted like an insane lunatic before in all those years? \n\nI\u2019m guessing no, which means that it\u2019s not logical to believe bridezilla\u2019s narrative that she\u2019s suddenly acting badly without at least questioning her instead of jumping down her throat! \ud83d\ude1e", "To be clear, this is irrelevant to her being TA throughout right?", "Not an excuse for such vile behaviour towards other pregnant women. \n\nPeople do not get pregnant at the same time as friends and family members find out they\u2019re infertile purely out of spite. Not only does no one think like that, it\u2019s also not possible to time a pregnancy so perfectly like that! \ud83d\ude1e", "I mean, this shouldn't be possible! \ud83e\udd23 Seriously, why is the bar for a bride's behavior so low.", "I think you\u2019re responding to someone trying to figure out the reason, not excuse her behaviour. Obviously an AH but  I too, want to know why she\u2019s being an AH", "I don't get it either. And being Queen for a day doesn't prepare you for the actual realities of marriage.", "Totally agree, which is why I am baffled by what is going on the family too.\n\nShould probably call my mother and thank her for being normal...", "Exactly. They didn\u2019t come to him or his wife and ask them questions based on bridezilla\u2019s bizarre narrative (we don\u2019t know what it is, but it has to have been really insane).\n\nSo after making the decision to not at least investigate her claims before making judgements, they don\u2019t deserve a pass for nasty calls or texts, either! \n\nIf anyone wants to shake off the fog in the future, they\u2019d owe a massive apology to OP and his wife - plus a lot of kissing up - before they\u2019d even CONSIDER forgiving such vile behaviour. \n\nBridezilla would have to put in more effort than humanly possible to earn even so much as a polite conversation from her brother at any point in the future, though. Because this is beyond the usual bridezilla level of messed up. \ud83d\ude22", "Honestly, I think folks just default to giving in to the loudest just to avoid conflict, then just run with it", "So, so true. Been married for many years and marriage is a lot of compromise and sacrifice. In my view totally worth it, but it definitely isn't the all about me show, nor should it be. \n\nI'm proud of mom for standing up for her son and for his wife and future grandchild.\n\nFrankly, if my daughter pulled this shit, I'd go to Disneyland myself.\n\nEdited due to typos.", "Hah\n\n>Frankly, if my daughter pulled this shit, I'd go to Disneyland myself\n\nHahaha! Have a great day!"]}
