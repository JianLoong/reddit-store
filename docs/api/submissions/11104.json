Originally it was fine but as my wife's pregnancy became visible, my sister would at times taunt her and make rude comments towards her. During her bachelorette party (just a few days ago), she even yelled at her because she was ruining her fun by being too distracting and \"not-drinking\" (I kid you not). The ensuing onslaught resulted in my wife being removed as one of her bridesmaids. She even left my PREGNANT wife on the side of the road as my sister made her way to a party planned, in part, by my wife and in a limosine paid for by me.\n\nThis coupled with the fact that she had asked me recently to ask my wife to stay at home, \"because her pregnancy will take attention away from her on her special day\", just broke me.

Because the rest of your narrative does make it sound like bridezilla is a completely hard done by victim except for that one sentence.\n\nBut the fact that I\u2019ve known the pregnant woman as part of the family for years might also give me pause. \n\nBut I\u2019ve never been one to put much stock in rumour mongering. And I do come from a loud, crazy family, but not loud and crazy as in the types to drag each other into every conflict between any two people! We just don\u2019t behave like that. \ud83d\ude0f", "NTA. Sounds like you are standing by your wife which is the better choice to me.

Bridzilla can trip on her vail for all you should care.", "NTA", "I have seen so many posts about brides being upset with pregnant relatives \u201cstealing their spotlight\u201d. I was pregnant during my SIL\u2019s wedding (wedding was postponed bc of pandemic) and my sister\u2019s wedding is within a week of my due date. I swear I\u2019m not doing it on purpose! Lol. I apologized to both brides and offered to step down from my role in weddings and be a normal guest. However both SIL and now my sister were just excited for future baby and happy to still have me celebrate them on their special days. I do not understand the animosity towards these poor soon to be mamas!", "Nta. Thank you for supporting your wife.", "NTA", "\"She even left my PREGNANT wife on the side of the road as my sister made her way to a party planned, in part, by my wife and in a limosine paid for by me.\"\n\nNTA\n\nYour sister should consider herself lucky if you ever speak to her again IMO.", "This is incredibly sad to read. Your poor wife. I am very curious as to the reason for your sister's abuse.", "NTA- Your sister is a major AH.", "Nta - there's also no way in hell I would let my sibling see my future child if they behaved like this towards my pregnant spouse.", "NTA- you stood up for your wife. Do not give in. Your sister and anyone who supports her behavior is the asshole.", "Nta and to be quite honest, OP, I would have a sit down chat with your sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9. If this is how she is acting right now, completely out of character, and how she is treating your wife, then how is she treating him? I would let him know that you won\u2019t stand for her behavior and that if it continues you will not be a part of their lives. I would also let him know that there is still PLENTY of time to get out this relationship, if he so chooses. But in all reality, it\u2019s his day too and he needs to get this behavior in check (as he would probably know a good bit about her day-to-day behavior and very stressed behavior). I\u2019d recommend you tell your family what\u2019s happened and why you feel the way you do, and leave it at that. You don\u2019t owe them an explanation, but stressing your pregnant wife is definitely not helping. Finally, best of luck. I hope it works out for you in the end.", "Being from a very small town I can see how something like this could happen and people would believe the bride. You absolutely should send out proof of everything the bride is doing so that everyone knows what kind of person she is.

Enjoy the trip to Disney, your wife deserves it", "NTA.\n\nNTA.\n\nNTA!!!\n\nIf that were my sister we would be cutting off all communication. I would not be looking for an apology to come. Cold-turkey quit that fam. Her behaviour is un-fucking-acceptable.", "NTA. Your wife is your closest family, with a little one on the way-protect them and her stress levels more than anything else! Your sister has already gotten more towards her wedding events from you than she deserves. Your sister pushed for harming your baby so she could have fun, she\u2019s trash.", "We know you're NTA.\n\nThere's only one witch-with-a-capital-b in this story and it ain't your wife.\n\nEnjoy Disneyland!", "NTA", "NTA Seems you have everything handled appropriately.", "NTA. This would be the end of the relationship for me.", "Seriously. You are NTA, so just don\u2019t become one by sinking to your sister\u2019s level, and thank you for sticking up for your wife and child.", "> OP write a list of what your sister has said and done to your wife and then the follow up call where she said she always hated that bitch and send it out to everyone who's contacted you to bitch you out.\n\nI always wonder if the people taking the side of people like the sister here honestly know what the fuck actually happened. I've seen updates where the OP finally clears things up and everybody changes their stance because they are not inhuman assholes. Why don't they seem to clarify from the beginning?\n\nIt would only take confronting one or two of the supposed flying monkeys doing the bidding of the sister here on their side before it spreads to the rest of the family... that's of course assuming they are not as toxic as they seem here once they have the whole story.", "Their \u201cspecial day\u201d is alllll about them. No one is allowed to have a conversation about anything else, only the bride. If a guest or bridesmaid is pregnant, they can\u2019t show up.

Everything everywhere must always be about the bride!", "My son was 10 days old when my sister got married. In no way did he distract from the situation at hand. I wouldn\u2019t let him be passed around, so mostly me and hubby held him, or set him in the stroller if he was sleeping. \n\nI was horrendously pregnant for the bachelorette, but we all still had a good time.

Not every villain needs an origin story.", "Stop coming from a place of reason!  \ud83e\udd23\n\nMy family was toxic. It didn\u2019t matter how rational an explanation was, they would always assume the worst because they fed on the drama. \u201cOutsiders\u201d like OP\u2019s wife would never catch a break and would obviously be jealous of her SIL, knowing how much prettier she will be on her day. \ud83d\ude44"]}
