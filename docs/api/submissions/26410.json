Me and my boyfriend didn't want to let them in, but we have a very big home and my parents were very pushy, so we finally agreed.\n\nMy sister has always been spoiled by my parents and she spoiled my nephew and niece as well. The problem is that my nephew he smashed his car and now he doesn't have one.\n\nYesterday my daughter visited us and she had her new car. When my nephew saw it he said it wasn't fair she has a car and he doesn't, so he demanded one even more expensive. Obviously his parents can't afford it, so they all said I had to buy him one.\n\nI refused and they said since he lived in my house it was now also my responsibility to provide for him.

Some hours later I received a call from my parents and they said I was a horrible sister and aunt and I had to help family.\n\nSince then I received a lot of texts and my boyfriend thinks maybe we should just buy him a car since we can afford it, but I'm against it.

Wow your family is toxic AF!", "No is a complete answer. He had one and wrecked it, I'm presuming his fault. Actions have consequences.

So, no, transportation isn't your problem. \n\nThey need to have both parents get jobs within 30 days, and have plans to move within 90 days.
