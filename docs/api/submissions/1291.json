For context, I (F20) just blew up on my bf (26M) because he keeps talking about a topic that I have a problem with. We have been dating for almost 2 years. He\u2019s my first serious relationship. \n\nAlso a side note, at the time I was and still am sick, on my period, sister just got into a major accident just a couple days ago who I couldn\u2019t see because I\u2019m sick (she has a 2 year old) and his brother is sick (we all live together)\n\nMy boyfriend keeps talking about men and women in a relationship and the roles that each should have. At first we had a debate and I disagreed, at first, because of the way he worded it and how he kept saying it. He finally, after a couple days, worded it better and for me to understand and I decided that we might just have different POVs. The problem is that now he brought it up, that\u2019s all he\u2019s been talking about. Even to where his brother brought up that he called out for being sick (I was eavesdropping) and he said \u201cMen are called weak if they call out for being sick\u201d to which I thought in my head, it doesn\u2019t have to be a whole \u201cMen are called weak\u201d it\u2019s that he interacts with people? And he shouldn\u2019t go to work sick? So how is it that that shows weakness? That ticked me off. And on top of that, he full on told his brother I already thought he was sexist when they were talking in the living room about this topic. The brother looked at me (I was sitting in front of the heater because I was cold which is by the living room) because he thought I might not want to hear their topic. So anyways, today I was laying in bed and he came up to me and apologized because he kinda got mad and overreacted to something I did. I thought all was good and then he brought the topic up again and I said \u201cI swear if I hear you say \u2018men should and women should\u2019 come out of your mouth I\u2019m gonna lose it\u201d and he got mad and said \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell you what\u2019s on my mind but sure. I won\u2019t open up to you. Then you wonder why I talk to my brother for hours\u201d and walked out of the room. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I overreacted or not due to my head being foggy from being sick for a few days now and being on my period. I\u2019m emotional as is, especially not being able to see my sister yet. AITA?\n\nEdit: We haven\u2019t talked for a few hours and I\u2019m feeling guilty\n\nEdit 2: His ways is that I should take care of him and the house and that he\u2019ll take care of me financially. That\u2019s not my issue. My issue is that he says feminism ruined this world because it made it soft. That women have it easier then men and he\u2019s always \u201cthe end of world is coming\u201d (He\u2019s also a veteran who did 6 years and had an ex wife) and it irritates me because I sometimes just want to be in the now and he talks about this topic a lot to which I can\u2019t enjoy being around him", "created_utc": 1667584709, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ym5p57/aita_for_blowing_up_on_my_bf/", "score": 2, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like your boyfriend has some unhealthy attitudes about gender differences.\n\nAlso this is obnoxious and manipulative: \u201cI\u2019m trying to tell you what\u2019s on my mind but sure. I won\u2019t open up to you. Then you wonder why I talk to my brother for hours\u201d\n\n1. Him talking to his brother is a good thing 2. You don't always need to hear what's on his mind. If he knows it will bother you he can either wait until a different time or keep it to himself sometimes. Being in a relationship means sharing a lot, not *everything*. 3. Going from \"you don't want to hear this one thing\" to \"I won't open up to you\" is unadulterated emotional abuse and completely unacceptable.", "lol ESH. He sucks for well, everything, and you suck for dating someone whos obviously misogynistic and an ah.", "The dudes either sexist or immature. Probably both.\n\nRegardless, NTA. As I always repeat myself, he continuously crosses a boundary that you made. He's an AH.", "INFO:  There are always going to be male - female differences.  Was there a specific comment other than the calling in sick thing that really triggered you?", "NTA. Your boyfriend is.", "Without a specific example of what he thinks \"men and women should\" do, it's a little hard to give an accurate assessment, but it does sound like he's got some sexist tendencies.\n\nBut you really shouldn't be eavesdropping on his private conversations if you know he wants them to be private. That isn't okay either. \n\nIt sounds like your boyfriend feels strongly about rigid gender rolls, and you don't, and I can tell you from experience that this is going to lead either to constant fights or a breakup. There's no shame in going separate ways because you just don't have compatible beliefs and wants from your relationship. \n\nBlowing up is not going to solve anything. It's going to make him feel defensive and probably more entrenched and justified in his views.\n\nI'll go with NTA, but please reconsider whether this is the relationship you want.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nAfter reading your other comments I think you need to really evaluate this relationship and if you should continue with it. You want a career and to pay your own way, but he wants you to stay at home and basically be a housewife. When he says \"take care of him\" he doesn't mean when he's sick, he means you do literally everything in the house and he does nothing. Would you be happy doing all the cooking, cleaning, laundry, childcare, every single thing and he sits on his ass doing nothing? \r  \n\r  \nHis views are outdated and he is coming off as very misogynistic.", "Well for info his ways of male/female relationships is that he wants to be taken care of and that he doesn\u2019t want me working because he can take  care of me. I don\u2019t have a problem with that. I like taking care of him. I have a problem with his whole \u201cMen are strong and have to take care of women and women are emotional and shouldn\u2019t take care of the household financially\u201d I want to work to pay my own bills and help with the house and on occasion, buy him stuff. He doesn\u2019t want me to and says that as his women, I should take care of the house and him. Again, I don\u2019t have an issue with that but it\u2019s just the whole me working. I want to pay my own bills", "NTA. Your boyfriend must have time travelled from the 50ies.", "Ok.  NTA.  It's one thing if he wants a mother at home raising children, but it sounds like that's not the case.  If you desire a career, then that's solely your choice as he's not your husband.  You need to evaluate this relationship because it sounds like you guys have very different goals.", "Oh wow, sounds like my parents mentality. There will be time where you may have to work if you all ever get into a financial crisis and i guarantee he will not step up with taking care of the household. That happened with my parents and they recently got separated. My dad seeked therapy to save the marriage and one of the main things he learned is that his mindset was sexist and was something he had to address. He now cleans up after himself even though he works. A woman is not a man's maid even if she stays home.\n My husband and i both work but  I am the bread winner. Even though I am the bread winnerr, when we first got married he did not clean up after himself and i did way more work around the house than he did. I let him know that if he didn't step up and cleaned after himself and took on more housework we would not work out.  he cleans up after himself now and we both take care of the household. For the most part, Society unfortunately doesn't teach men that they need to clean after themselves and that managing a household/ doing all the housework and childcare are each a full-time job in themselves.", "Which is it? \n\n1:\n> he wants to be taken care of. I don\u2019t have a problem with that. I like taking care of him. He doesn\u2019t want me to [work] and says that as his woman, I should take care of the house and him. Again, I don\u2019t have an issue with that\n\nOr 2:\n> I want to work to pay my own bills and help with the house and on occasion, buy him stuff.  it\u2019s just the whole me working. I want to pay my own bills\n\nThis is a very basic dichotomy in your relationship, and you need to figure out which side you come down on, 1 or 2.  \n\nRight now, it seems like you're telling him you can do option 1, but you turn around and tell him you want option 2.  The problem with this scenario is that option 2 is _directly counter_ to the wants/needs/opinions of option 1.  \n\nCan you follow along with Option 1, or can you not? \n\nEverything after that is a separate argument."]}
