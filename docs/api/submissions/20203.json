{"id": 20203, "submission_id": "14evxpj", "title": "AITA for standing by the \"threat\" I made while in labor?", "selftext": "I (F25) have been with my husband, B, (M25) for 3 years, married for 1. I get along well with his family, but his mom and one sister (F22) can be domineering. They hold & express ideas about how to live life, specific ways things need to be done, etc. Any other way is wrong to them. Def a point of frustration for me throughout the years (wedding planning & pregnancy) but when B or I have told them to back off, they\u2019ve almost always done so. SIL is an RN and started working in L&D a month prior to my daughter\u2019s birth.\n\nI had a very healthy pregnancy that ended in unplanned home birth a week before my due date, while visiting his family. I woke at 3am with strong contractions and woke B who ran to get his car keys. I knew that I would not make it to the hospital. I got to the bathroom and was pantsless pulling towels under me. At this point his family is awake and following him in. He screamed at them to get more towels and I screamed at him to close the bathroom door, and he did.MIL comes with towels, then EVERYONE is coming into the bathroom while I\u2019m buttass naked on my hands and knees in excruicating pain. I screamed at them to GTFO and was crying begging B to make them leave. B kicked them out, closed the door (not locked). MIL & SIL were banging on the door shouting that SIL needs to come in since she\u2019s a nurse.I looked B in the eye and said if he lets anyone in before I said so, unless something started going wrong, I would seriously reconsider our marriage. He shouted at them to back off.Then I was crowning & whatever that looked like was enough for him to call in his sister, who left the door wide open for MIL to stand & watch my daughter come out of my vag as my husband caught her. Immediately SIL is grabbing at my baby, I\u2019m shooing her hands away to hold my crying infant while screaming at my husband to get her out. He eventually kicked her out bc I couldn\u2019t stop screaming.FIL had called 911 and they arrived within 10mins of her birth. Paramedics came in & cut the umbilical cord and let me birth the placenta. In the moments I had to sit, process, & hold my daughter before we had to go on the ambulance, B opened the door for MIL to come in & start gawking and poking at the baby.\n\nI know B was in a panic when he shouted for his sister to come in. But not with his mom. I really want to give him grace for this espeically since he did also stood up to them and I understand his stress was high as well. I\u2019m just having a really difficult time emotionally coping with what went down the night of my daughter\u2019s birth and my trust is severely and likely irreparably damaged. I told him that I meant what I said that night and he was shocked.\n\nMy daughter and I have been staying with my mom and B comes to see her almost daily. I agreed to counseling and we made an appointment but they\u2019re booked months out so it\u2019s not until September. B is devastated. His family is telling me he didn't know my \"threat\" was serious bc I was in labor.AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nETA clarity:\n\n\\- I love my husband and don't want to get divorced, but I cannot make myself magically feel secure around him again either after this traumatic experience. I am really hoping that counseling helps in that regard.\n\n\\- SIL left the door open during my birth, not my husband. MIL and SIL have been telling people the story of my birth, graphically, ever since.\n\n\\- When my MIL came in the bathroom after my birth, it was because my husband opened the door specifically to let her in. He did not accidentally leave any doors open. It was me, him, and a paramedic in the bathroom with the door closed, he was sitting against the wall with me when his mother came to the door and called out to him to let her in. He got up, opened the door for her, and moved out of the way so she could enter.\n\n\\- I am not restricting his access to her while we are living separately. He lives one block away from my mom's house and is welcome to come and go at will. I'm breastfeeding and she currently won't accept bottles. I am actively working to get her to consistently accept bottles so that he can take her for longer periods and overnights.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1687317557, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14evxpj/aita_for_standing_by_the_threat_i_made_while_in/", "score": 888, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You want some semblance of privacy. Totally understandable. So you told him to keep others out unless things start going wrong. \n\nUnless he has specific labor and delivery knowledge he would have no real idea if things are going wrong or not. How would he know if the baby needed to be rotated or if the cord was being compromised? Is the baby coming out too fast and is that going to tear you?\n\nSo he did what seemed necessary in his panicked state. He let the medically trained person in. Even given that all went well in the end that was a reasonable decision given the circumstances. \n\nI've worked 911 and dealt with childbirth calls. I would have given instructions to FIL that SIL needs to be in there with you and to tell you that is 911's strong recommendation.\n\nThe only soft AH is MIL. She wanted to be in there but didn't need to be in there. But she is likely more than just excited, she's  probably a bit panicked too. Home birth wasn't the plan and presumably she knows that.", "NAH\n\nBirth should never be a spectacle. MIL and FIL should have stayed well away after your request. SIL popping in? I'm willing to give B some grace there. You're giving birth, early, in his parents' bathroom, and SIL is an L&D nurse. Considering the circumstances, that's a pretty great person to have around.\n\nAnd...I can't fault B for the open door either, though again, MIL and FIL should have been cooling their jets in the kitchen or someplace where you could have a bit of privacy. Think about it. You're screaming, they're screaming, a baby is being born, and nothing is going according to plan...an open door is bound to happen as people are trying to handle a situation they have no training or anticipation for.\n\nCouples counseling is a great idea. You guys need that and some healthy boundaries with his family, which he (as they're his family) can start putting in place now. His family doesn't need to be contacting you at the moment since they're the main cause of your stress. It's okay for you to put them in time-out on your phone, social media, email, whatever. It would be ideal for your husband to say so, but if he's not strong enough to do that yet, go ahead and do it yourself: *MIL/FIL/SIL, I will not be responding to your communication. You will have to speak with your Son/Brother from now on.* You don't need to explain, apologize, or attach an end date.\n\nI'd also advise posting this without the asshole caveat (since my suggestions aren't judgment subs) to r/JUSTNOMIL and r/Mildlynomil for feedback from people who have been in similar situations as yourself.", "NTA- I was fine with him letting his sister in. Delivering a baby is scary and an extra pair of hands is a good thing. He probably was too freaked out to remember to shut the door again. Opening the door for his mother to poke and gush however, that\u2019s a big no. She wasn\u2019t doing anything other than wasting space in the bathroom and could\u2019ve waited.", "I think the biggest asshole here is MIL. Sounds like OP made it pretty fucking clear to get out, and forced her way in every chance she got. SIL banging on the door because she's a nurse and can actually help? Fair. But MIL did not need to be right there next to her, REALLY did not need to stand at the open door and watch the whole gory thing, and should not have insisted on crowding a mother/baby 3 minutes after birth. \n\nOP: overreacting to what was clearly an exceptionally traumatic birthing experience\n\nHusband: could have tried harder to get MIL to give them some semblance of privacy\n\nSo, I guess ESH, but MIL inserting herself the way she did seems the worst.", "I'm going to put in my 2 cents in before this get locked, b/c I'm pretty sure this is where this is going.\n\nFirst NAH\n\nReddit has people who feel that the best answer to everything is to just cut people out of your life. No healing, talking, thinking things through, just leave. You can do that if you want, but first:\n\nBirth trauma is very real. Not having an expected experience is very traumatic and it will cause you to have PTSD. Get into therapy ASAP. It is not a case of you not just \"getting your way\" or \"you should be grateful you both are ok.\" It was painful and terrifying, and out of your control.\n\nWhile it was not painful for your spouse or the family, it was terrifying to them also. They woke up to chaos and human instinct is to help. Because you have a rocky history with them, it felt very invasive, but for them, they just wanted to help. While your SIL may not have been an L&D nurse for very long, she has heard the stories of what can go wrong, and there is a lot, so her instinct to be there was very strong. Unattended out of hospital births have multiple risk factors that you do not need to hear or learn about right now.\n\n The rest of the family should have backed off, but they didn't, they thought they were helping. They were wrong. It happens. Put some distance between you. It will do them good.\n\nYour husband does not deserve to be held accountable for what was going on. He did his best, in, again, a terrifying situation. Child birth is so outside of his understanding he can never know how exposed you felt. But you can talk to him, share how afraid you were and try to come to some sort of peace. He did not set out to hurt you, he was afraid. He may never be as afraid again.\n\nOP I am sorry this happened. You are right to be upset, but don't let it prevent you from seeking healing for both you, your daughter and your husband.", "Your husband was scared for you and your child together.  His sister is trained specifically for this situation.  He isn't.  I'm sure his thought process was to get you and the baby the best help he could as fast as he could, and that meant his sister.  Please cut him some slack and don't let this ruin your marriage.  I get why you're upset but I doubt that in this particular situation he was acting out of anything other than concern and love for you and your child together.  \n\nI don't want to call anyone an AH here so I'm going with NAH just because of that.\n\nI hope you can move on and let this go.", "MIL is the only AH here. Well, and SIL for graphically telling the story afterwards. I'd *strongly* suggest couples counseling and going low contact with at least MIL", "Having had a traumatic birth experience with my daughter - although not on your level! - I feel for you.   And I'm so happy that you and your daughter are both well.\n\nNTA for feeling so angry and hurt about his MIL behaviour.   She sounds like she's a PITA and has major main character syndrome.   NTA for being angry at your husband for letting her into the bathroom,  NTA for being pissed off and feeling violated that SIL left the door open so MIL was gawking, NTA for feeling rage filled and hurt that they are making hay out of your child's birth and almost minimising what you and your husband went through. \n\nSoft YTA if you're angry about him letting his medical professional sister into the room as he would have been panicking himself and she is absolutely qualified to help. \n\nPlease think about therapy or trauma counselling.   You absolutely need to feel safe,  you and your child.   The real \"villain\" is your MIL for barging in and your SIL and MIL for making social currency out of this.   Maybe part of re-establising trust with your husband is for you to go NC with them until you do feel safe and for him to uphold that boundary with you and for you.   You need to know he will protect you both and right now you don't feel safe as he has \"shown\" (in a time of absolute stress,  panic and terror for you both) that he won't hold that line for you.   However no malice there,  although I understand completely that that does not help. \n\nBe kind to yourself and also to him,  and please get the trauma help you need.   Both of you.", "I was okay with the sil/nurse, but why was husband letting his mother in? There was NO reason for her to be there and op made a very strong and reasonable request that mil NOT be allowed in. I would be equally unhappy that husband didn\u2019t put me first.", "You can forgive him for the SIL incident. However he clearly crossed boundaries letting MIL in the room. Has he apologized for choosing her over you and crossing the boundary you had set for this very private moment?  Then she\u2019s poking at the baby? Nope! Unacceptable!  Have any of them apologized? Glad FIL called the ambulance he was the only one truly thinking if you and the birth of the baby; the others just wanted to intrude and they did. Now they are trying to make you feel guilty instead of fixing what they did wrong. You are NTA!", "I hope you can get into individual therapy asap to help you process your birth experience.  That should help you navigate what you really feel versus what is trauma from a crazy fast birth versus what is PPD or baby blues/hormone drop.  \n\nOne thing I will say is that you can\u2019t get these first days back and neither can your husband or daughter.  It feels cruel to rob all of you but particularly them of this time together.  \n\nIf you decide to divorce your husband because of how he acted in the crisis, okay.  But don\u2019t block him and your daughter from these precious early days.  The punishment doesn\u2019t fit the crime.", "Your annoyance and frustration are understandable, to an extent. However, I do think that you\u2019re holding your husband to an unfair standard. Yes, you gave him clear instructions, but he was also dealing with the chaos and fear created by an unplanned home birth. In his shoes, I\u2019d have been terrified, and would have welcomed the presence of a labor and delivery nurse. For that, you should cut him some slack. He was worried about you and your child. Now, when it comes to his mother, he was more clearly wrong but, again, less than ideal circumstances. ESH", "NTA.MIL sure is. She and SIL should also not be sharing your traumatic birth story with others. Please ask your husband to tell them to shut up and leave you alone. Please think about how worried he was about you and remember how much he loves you. Take care of yourself. Be kind to yourself. You are doing the best you can.", "I say this with love, NAH and I think seeking some counseling for yourself is a good idea. Your husband was scared and was trying to do the best thing at the time. This was not a normal delivery in the care of professionals. In fact, the only professional with an ounce of knowledge was being kicked out! I can understand that feeling emotionally and physically exposed without expectation of that happening would be scary and jarring. But I think you need to extend your husband an smidge more grace than you are doing.", "NTA, his family is, not for trying to help during labor, for overstepping their lives and for telling the graphic story about the birth to people. Freaking disgusting family he has. He has to cut them off in order to have a healthy unit family.", "NTA. The mom and sister telling the story is the bad part because it\u2019s taken it out of the moment where emotions were high and nobody was thinking clearly. He let his mom into the bathroom. Not great but also understandable given the moment. \n\nThem telling the story after that is a huge violation of privacy and is to me the biggest issue here", "NTA. Fuck those people. Take all the time you need.", "I understand that your husband catered to his mother's requests instead of making sure you were okay.  I'd be super upset too.  If you can't come first when in the process  of giving birth and right after then when is the man ever going to put you first?  He doesn't get it.  Your family is the two of you and your baby. That's first. MIL needs to step back", "NTA", "I understand you are hurt that your significant other panicked at the moment of your greatest weakness. Go get some counselling and work on that underlying resentment of his family and establish boundaries whether that boundary includes your soon to be ex, or is limited to your strong resentment of the rest of his family.\n\nNAH for me because I honestly can't call your husband an asshole for panicking nor leaving the door open during said panicking.", "I can totally understand the husband letting the SIL in since she\u2019s an L&D nurse, but everything else? Nope. The MIL should not have been allowed anywhere near OP and the SIL should\u2019ve respected her wishes and made sure her MIL stayed well enough away. I seriously cannot understand why SIL is going around telling the birth story with MIL. She\u2019s a health care worker. She knows about HIPAA law. Which also protects OP even though OP gave birth at home. OP could very well make a complaint to the board of nursing and get SIL in deep trouble. I completely understand OP\u2019s reaction and she absolutely should follow through on what she\u2019s doing right now. Her husband failed to protect her in her most vulnerable state. That\u2019s not something you soon forget.", "NTA.  Obviously you knew what kind of stupid vulgar loose lipped assholes SIL and MIL are and that is why you didn't want them gawking at you.  Your communication was clear.  Your husband should have asked your permission to let in SIL.  Let you have a second to prepare.  After not asking and going against your wishes he should have shut the door after SIL.  He should have asked if he could let MIL in after the  paramedics.  Apparently your husband is incapable of listening or respect in an emergency.  Of course you are upset.  On one of his visits ask him what he is doing to stop their foul betrayal in the way they talk of your birth experience.  Has he told them he will go no contact if they don't stop?  That they won't have contact with the baby?  Have you called you SIL's supervisor to report her gross unprofessionalism?  You need to.  Good luck.", "NTA\nLabor and birth aren\u2019t easy. Physically going through it or witnessing it. He\u2019s your husband, your partner you picked to be there for you and have a child with.

But don\u2019t let those uncomfortable feelings, embarrassment, frustration and pain overshadow that ultimately? You\u2019ve got a healthy baby with you, your partner is clearly doing whatever they can to make you comfortable in moving forward. But talk to them about what kind relationship you want to have with his family moving forward. Your birth story is not something for them to make light of or feel okay sharing when you\u2019re still obviously processing what you went through and how you\u2019re feeling. \n\nGood luck, I hope you and he are able to work through it all and you genuinely enjoy your new role as you embark in motherhood. Enjoy it with your child\u2019s father. Seek therapy yourself to help you cope with your emotions and thoughts on this without anyone else involved if need be.

There is absolutely no reason your husband should have allowed things to go down this way. Just because it was an unplanned home birth doesn\u2019t mean it was unsafe and that his family were entitled to be in the room. Guess what, women having been having \u201chome\u201d births for literally 1000s of years. And before any one says blah blah blah modern medicine saves lives, look at the maternal mortality rate in comparison to less modern countries. If OP is in USA there\u2019s a possibility she was safer giving birth without intervention. \n\nMaybe if his family weren\u2019t AHs to begin with you would have felt more comfortable with one of them in the room. As a nurse I can tell you that I would have stayed outside the door as long as my brother and SIL were still reporting that things were going well and safe, while trying to calm and comfort my SIL so she felt trust in having me there. I completely understand that your trust is broken and that you need time to heal, both physically and emotionally.

His intention was not 'OP is being silly' it was 'I don't want my child to die'. After all, if the intervention had led to your sister saving the child from suffocating B would be a hero after all.\n\nIt's unclear if you had asked earlier for MIL to not be present at the birth, which would have perhaps girded him for the moment, but giving birth is not something we do a lot so forgivable to not have all contingencies planned.\n\nThe threat you made has been carried out, but it's up to you to decide if it is sufficient and it's time for forgiveness.\n\nExpecting a partner, B or the next one, to always make the right decision in a life or death crisis?  That's unrealistic and unfair.  Your anxiety isn't just about B, it's a deeper issue I think.\n\nAllowing him to stay with you at least does not alter your threat but also allows him a chance to atone, and you may feel different about his reliability watching him be a consistent father.", "Yta.

They hold & express ideas about how to live life, specific ways things need to be done, etc. Any other way is wrong to them. Def a point of frustration for me throughout the years (wedding planning & pregnancy) but when B or I have told them to back off, they\u2019ve almost always done so. SIL is an RN and started working in L&D a month prior to my daughter\u2019s birth.\n\n  \nI had a very healthy pregnancy that ended in unplanned home birth a week before my due date, while visiting his family. I woke at 3am with strong contractions and woke B who ran to get his car keys. I knew that I would not make it to the hospital. I got to the bathroom and was pantsless pulling towels under me. At this point his family is awake and following him in. He screamed at them to get more towels and I screamed at him to close the bathroom door, and he did.  \nMIL comes with towels, then EVERYONE is coming into the bathroom while I\u2019m buttass naked on my hands and knees in excruicating pain. I screamed at them to GTFO and was crying begging B to make them leave. B kicked them out, closed the door (not locked). MIL & SIL were banging on the door shouting that SIL needs to come in since she\u2019s a nurse.  \nI looked B in the eye and said if he lets anyone in before I said so, unless something started going wrong, I would seriously reconsider our marriage. He shouted at them to back off.  \nThen I was crowning & whatever that looked like was enough for him to call in his sister, who left the door wide open for MIL to stand & watch my daughter come out of my vag as my husband caught her. Immediately SIL is grabbing at my baby, I\u2019m shooing her hands away to hold my crying infant while screaming at my husband to get her out. He eventually kicked her out bc I couldn\u2019t stop screaming.  \nFIL had called 911 and they arrived within 10mins of her birth. Paramedics came in & cut the umbilical cord and let me birth the placenta. In the moments I had to sit, process, & hold my daughter before we had to go on the ambulance, B opened the door for MIL to come in & start gawking and poking at the baby.\n\n  \nI know B was in a panic when he shouted for his sister to come in. But not with his mom. I really want to give him grace for this espeically since he did also stood up to them and I understand his stress was high as well. I\u2019m just having a really difficult time emotionally coping with what went down the night of my daughter\u2019s birth and my trust is severely and likely irreparably damaged. I told him that I meant what I said that night and he was shocked.\n\n  \nMy daughter and I have been staying with my mom and B comes to see her almost daily. I agreed to counseling and we made an appointment but they\u2019re booked months out so it\u2019s not until September. B is devastated. His family is telling me he didn't know my \"threat\" was serious bc I was in labor.  \nAITA?  \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA, but your husband is not the correct focus of your problem.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> I cannot make myself magically feel secure around him again either after this traumatic experience\n\nConsider that this was also likely a very traumatic experience for your husband. He wasn't the one giving birth, sure, but the woman he loves was giving impromptu birth on the bathroom floor in what sounds like an absolutely chatoic mess of an environment.\n\nHe wasn't making conscious decisions here, he was handling something he was absolutely not equipped to handle the best he could. He probably could have handled it better, but there's nothing in here that should impact your trust. It was just a shit, panicked situation for everybody all around.\n\nOn the other hand, your SIL and MIL are major boundary-stepping assholes.", "NTA. I\u2019m horrified for you. I\u2019d feel very similarly! I understand him letting his sister in. \nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s okay he had that door revolving constantly for MIL to be present. \nWith the expertise of SIL, the ambulance on its way, she should have respected your wish to have some privacy.\n\n I also think SIL having been a RN for years and now L&D should have the forethought to help you feel as safe and dignified as possible. Im sure even in emergencies at work she closes the door / curtain. As soon as baby was out, someone should have given you a towel to cover yourself. \n\nBirth trauma is VERY well. And the care we receive during childbirth are the memories we hold on to most over the years. Not the pain, but the care and support.\n\nThe part that angers me the most in this is your husband, willingly opening the door for MIL after your birth to see the baby before youd even been properly assessed by the paramedics, covered up, and recovered somewhat. That is rage inducing for me.", "NTA as he totally let you down and didn\u2019t show you the respect you deserved or listen to you. Even if he was clueless he should have kept the SIL out and trusted you to tell him if you needed help and letting the MiL in was totally out of order. Separation, letting him visit and seeing a counselor together like you\u2019re doing is a good idea to see if you can salvage the marriage.", "Yta. Keeping a nurse out while you're giving birth, you're an ahole.", "OP, this was a traumatic event and if you divorce him now, you\u2019d be blowing up your family for an event it seems you haven\u2019t fully processed yet. You were giving birth in the middle of the night, in a bathroom. It is unreasonable to hold your husband to the standard that frankly, you shouldn\u2019t have logically been asking for. Family politics aside, having a L&D nurse there may not have been your favorite choice, but it is what was best for your CHILD. \n\nAs for the letting the mother in while you\u2019d earlier said no, give him the grace. My guess is he, like yourself, was at the very least in a bit of shock still. When you look back at the situation, do you genuinely think he was intentionally undermining you or acting with malicious intent? If the answer is yes, then maybe separation is right. But no one on Reddit can answer that. Only you know if he was acting with ill-intent or perhaps just still trying to process everything that had gone down.", "NTA. It's okay to be concerned about what decisions your partner makes in a high stress situation.", "This is a nightmare and i feel you. Im so sorry. Your MIL is definitely TA. Wtf.", "YTA. your home birth could've gone so wrong. You should be grateful for having a labor and delivery nurse for a sil", "\u201cHis family is telling me he didn\u2019t know my \u2018threat\u2019 was serious bc I was in labor.\u201d\nUm, why is his family communicating with you, instead of backing the fuck off and just your husband communicates with you directly. NTA, unless you\u2019ve literally never told him how difficult being around his family is for you. He had no business letting MIL in the bathroom to see the baby when you weren\u2019t ready. In a moment of panic, he put his MIL\u2019s wishes above yours, and your broken trust is entirely understandable - how are you to know he can be relied on in the next crisis?", "NTA, you had a traumatic birth experience that your husband invited. You have EVERY right to be upset at him. labor is the most vulnerable thing that women to through and he invited people you explicitly didn\u2019t want to see you in that way and let them observe you like a spectacle.", "I am so sorry that was your experience. It sounds truly traumatic. I don\u2019t think anyone was particularly an AH but I also think that your feelings are valid. No one can tell you how to feel. \n\nIMO you & your husband have just gone through something traumatic and you can\u2019t change facts. What happens now is between you and your husband to decide. You are right that you need to feel secure and be able to trust your husband. You feel that he let you down in a moment that you needed him. No amount of talking you around to his position will likely change your feelings on this. I suspect that he feels now that you are letting him down when he needs you. He is literally missing out on so many moments with his child. Only the two of you can decide if this is something that you can fix. \n\nYour MIL & SIL telling graphic stories of the birth especially knowing that you are considering divorce is beyond comprehension. It\u2019s like they don\u2019t even understand their part in the trauma. I honestly wouldn\u2019t even care about them but I would be cutting them out of my life. I couldn\u2019t forgive them this. Can your husband support that? Ultimately you\u2019re hurting badly and your hormones will be all over the place. The lack of remorse from your ILs likely mean this won\u2019t end happily", "NTA. As someone who recently gave birth, and soon to give another, that's the moment you need to feel secure and safe, and your partner must be YOUR champion, not his family's, and make YOU feel secure and safe in the most vulnerable moment of your entire life. Your feelings are valid. I would look for other, sooner, counselling, maybe online? Waiting till September is a very long time and it can be irrepairable by then", "NTA, but I'd give him a second chance. That was a high stress situation. \nMy partner had a habit of inviting my parents over to \"check up on me\" after hospital visits (I've got an ongoing condition). He knew that stressed me out because my mom would drag me out of bed to start cleaning, but still sent them over anyway. I took the extra house keys back (I own the place) and told him I respect his concern, but they won't respect my wishes, which is why I don't want them in my home while I'm just trying to sleep and recover, and if he can't respect that, I don't want him here either. \nHe has not yet had a chance to prove himself, I hope he doesn't fuck around and find out, I'd rather not have to split either, so, make it clear, and I mean CLEAR to him, then go from there. \nProbably remind him, too. They ain't always the brightest crayon in the box.", "I am not a doctor, but as a father who was present for both my kids births, post partum depression is a real and powerful thing, and can manifest itself in many ways, subtle and overt. I'm not suggesting that you're suffering from it but if you're already seeing a counselor it might be worth asking about. Beyond that, you are going to have both of those women in your life for a very long time. Before it eats away at you any more, and in the nicest possible way without ultimatum or threats, explain your side while understanding their side. Stand firm, but be prepared to bend a little. I'm also happy to hear that after this ordeal, both you and the baby are healthy and safe.", "YTA\n\nThere is no way he was equipped to handle that situation, nor was he in a completely rational state of mind. \n\nAnd when he let his mother in, he most likely thought it was 1) over, so you were fine now, and 2) likely wanted his own mom for some support. He just went through something, too.", "NTA.  \nYou're pregnant, you've got enough to deal with and they're still pulling that crap.  \nNot good enough.  \nI've known people who broke off family relations because of this.  \nDevastated or not he knew what his family was like and should've put his foot down a long time ago. Sounds like he loves you both, but you you need to set ground rules for HIM.  \nHis priority should now be focused on you and his child, not his parents or siblings. YOU.", "NTA. Your husband was panicking, but he turned to his mom for comfort instead of putting his needs sideband honoring your wishes and communicating with you.  It was the most vulnerable moment in your life and in an ideal world, he would have been able to communicate more effectively and be your champion. I get why the trust was broken.  It's crap of his family to defend him by saying he didn't know you were serious. And it's crap of him not to shut down their graphic retelling of the experience.  That said, I think this is fixable. He just needs to really hear you and be accountable instead of making excuses.  If you feel like he really gets your perspective, then maybe you'll start to have a path toward trusting him to have your back in the future.", "NTA.\nLabor is a very vulnerable time, and no one wants an audience. \nI would have given SIL some grace for the fact that she is a medical professional trained in this sort of thing, I\u2019m re-thinking that given the edit of SIL and MIL telling everyone the story in graphic detail. In fact, I\u2019d be reporting her for violating patient privacy!\nMIL is TAH.\nI hope couples counseling helps", "YTA and you need to get over yourself. SIL is a trained medical professional and your husband determined that he wanted that support. Who tf cares that your MIL saw you naked or whatever you're concerned about?  And why should your mother have to open her home to a newborn unexpectedly because you're throwing a fit?", "Soft YTA. \n\nWithout knowing these people, and being 3 months postpartum myself, I\u2019m inclined to think MIL truly was trying to help. We know she has at least 2 children, which is 2 more than OP had at the time. Of course they may have been C-sections, but statistically they weren\u2019t. She has more experience with childbirth than OP\u2019s husband. And of course if your DIL is giving birth in your bathroom, you\u2019re not going to like\u2026 stand in the kitchen?? They called 911 which was the right thing to do. And tbh I\u2019d probably want to see the baby that was just born on my bathroom floor too!! Is it fair for OP to be traumatized? Absolutely 1000000%. Is it fair to separate her husband from their newborn because of this? I don\u2019t think so, and that\u2019s the reasoning for the soft YTA. He did his best. He (and everyone else) are probably traumatized too from that experience. That\u2019s also probably why MIL and SIL are talking about it. I\u2019d be annoyed but holy shit you\u2019re telling me you wouldn\u2019t tell people if someone gave birth in your bathroom? Come on.", "NTA\n\nYou gave him ONE instruction and he ignored it.\n\nA really tough question: Will you ever trust him again? \n\nIf you get pregnant again, will you trust him enough to handle everything around him? What would he do in serious health questions when something goes wrong in the birth process? Would he follow your wishes or would he ask his soster and his mom? Because obviously he thinks their opinion on your body is worth more than yours.\n\nThis would be the end of the marriage FOR ME. I can understand if you love him and forgive him. I never would.", "NTA. Specifically the fact that you felt violated and now they are relaying the details to people.", "NTA, however, you both need to resolve this issue asap because it will annihilate your relationship and affect the relationship between him and the daughter. \nI am sure there would be a therapist available for one session somewhere. Alternatively, you can try a couples life coach and do the session over zoom. In my experience, life coaches are good at getting to the root of the issue and the root of what needs to change, quite quickly... whereas a therapist will want to spend the first couple of sessions getting your back ground info and relationship history etc.", "Soft YTA but only for one bit: being away from and blaming Dad. I know you're not \"restricting access\", but it's not your access to restrict. It's his child too. He is missing out on important moments by being there only sometimes. And he isn't an AH here, so you're only putting your and your child's relationship with him at risk for no gain.\n\nIf he didn't have a history of standing up to his MIL, then you'd have some cause for concern. But he does. He demanded they stay out until the moment he felt it was necessary to involve a medical professional who happened to be standing right outside the door.\n\nDad didn't know what could go wrong, and there was an L&D nurse present so he let her in. Having a homebirth is extremely risky. There's a reason why maternal mortality used to be so high, and has gone down so much: medical professionals. He was looking out for both you *and* *his child*.\n\nI don't know the bathroom situation. He should not have let her in if he did so. MIL sounds fucking awful and needs to shut the fuck up.  MIL is definitely an AH. Husband needs to stand up to her and go low contact (NC is probably not quite warranted here, but it's close). I don't doubt that he will. But pushing him away like this is isn't going to help.\n\nSIL, despite being a medical professional whose presence was probably valuable at the time, also needs to shut the fuck up now. She is kinda the AH too.\n\nBut your husband does is not. And you, gently, are until you fix things with him and stop resenting him.", "NAH (except maybe your in-laws, but not you or your husband). This was a really horrible experience for you. But it was also probably terrifying and bewildering for your husband. You can\u2019t magically trust him again, but you can take steps towards doing so. Therapy both for you and the two of you will probably be important in building that.", "NTA while I understand the fear of your husband your choices are valid. He wasn't the one in birth, you were. It is your decision to deny 'medical care' his sister could have provided. Only your wants should have mattered. I understand your embarassement and honestly I would feel the same if my BIL and MIL would watch me giving birth... Feels really gross. I would definitely feel unsafe around my husband if that would happen to me because I need to trust him in extreme medical decisions for example when I can't talk for myself. I need to trust him with life and death decisions and he needs to respect my wishes regarding these decisions. And it goes the other way around to.", "I\u2019m going against the grain and say NTA. your husband, sil, and mil are all assholes. I\u2019m with you 100% but I\u2019m glad you have at least until September ti figure out how you feel", "NTA. He sacrificed your safety and health, and that of your child, to his mother's and sister's wants. If you stay married to him, the rest of your life will be like that.\n\nFor them to say that he didn't believe you because you were in labor is misogynist, and tbh, I wouldn't believe it.\n\nBlock his family. They are STILL trying to control you, your husband, and your child. You and your marriage are none of their business.", "YTA", "NTA leave his ass", "Soft YTA. I understand that you are in labor and wants privacy. But this is your first child and your husband\u2019s first one. I can empathise that he was scared that things could go wrong. Not a bad decision at all to have a trained medical professional in there. Not worth destroying your marriage over and bringing unnecessary drama into what should be a blissful period in your lives. Move on.", "I had a very traumatic birth and after. We lost our son. My DD was a bg twins she will be 16 in Oct. Mines took him out of my arms after he passed when she was in FL for the 2 days my son fought for his life. He was 2 pounds ! She told his sibs they were fine lol. That woman there is as unhinged as they come. Make him do counseling and see where it goes .. or tell her I are tired of the bs. Just wait those mama bear hormones are gonna double your resolve!  ( Not that it's a bad thing?) \ud83d\ude1c", "YTA.  It's okay to be upset and freak out during traumatic and stressful situations.  However any reasonable and mature person takes a step back after these situations to examine them with a clear head.\n\nYour husbands crime was to want a family member who is a medical professional to make sure his child is okay and healthy.  If I were him I'd also seriously be reconsidering the marriage.", "Probably YTA here.  You seem overly worried about your appearance during a time when yours and your child's life are literally at risk.  It doesn't seem reasonable.  The only reason you aren't definitely the asshole is I imagine you were in extreme pain and not thinking clearly plus flooded with hormones.", "NAH", "YTA, you are not considering his feelings during a very emotional time.  He was concerned, he did stand up to them multiple times. You\u2019re taking this too far", "NTA- he didn\u2019t respect you or your needs at a very vulnerable and crucial time. It\u2019s unfortunate that he didn\u2019t realize, however you were very clear about your needs and he continued to violate them. You have every right to reconsider your relationship for any reason, but especially because it was a traumatic experience and you needed him to honor you while you were birthing his child. Do not listen to anyone except yourself- you were the one affected deeply, and you need time to heal. I would recommend individual therapy so that you have support now and are clearer when you go to counseling with him. You are absolutely not the ah and I recommend not listening to anyone who thinks you are.", "NTA I would push the bottle feeding if it\u2019s not right for you or daughter at the moment. Take all the time you need to heal from the traumatic birth. You only have to concentrate on you, your daughter and getting healthy right now. Everything and everyone else can wait until your physically and mentally stronger.\n\nHopefully you can work things out with husband and put boundaries for his mum and sister in place going forward but that\u2019ll come with time. Rushing things now based on others feeling and opinions when the problems stems from you not being listened to, your needs not being met/prioritised or boundaries respected at a vulnerable and important time for you may do more harm then good. Only have the conversation you want when you\u2019re ready.\n\nCongratulations on baby and good luck in the future", "I think you are putting too much blame on your husband\u2019s actions. When he let MIL into the bathroom with the paramedic, did you ask/tell him not to? Or did you not say anything as he got up?\n\nI\u2019m sure he was in shock over what just happened and MIL was too. At this point in time, she probably just wanted to see that you and the baby were ok, and his instinct was to show her that you were.\n\nYes, she over-stepped her bounds the entire time this was happening, but your husband probably wasn\u2019t in a mental state to police her the way you wanted at any point during all this, even after your daughter was born.\n\nIf this instance has broken your trust in him, you definitely need trauma therapy to help build that back. I don\u2019t think he did anything to deserve this breach of trust.\n\nBut by living separate from him right now, you\u2019re robbing your daughter of bonding time with her father and stealing time from him to be with together with his daughter and wife as a new family.", "Nothing soft about MIL\u2019s behaviour in this situation. If OP didn\u2019t want her watching, she shouldn\u2019t have been watching.\n\nEDIT:\n\n> MIL and SIL have been telling people the story of my birth, graphically, ever since.\n\nHey, I know what might help with that security for a while. Go no contact with MIL and SIL and ask husband to support you / advocate for your new family until you get a sincere, unequivocal apology and a complete cessation of this storytelling business. Holy. Shit.", "This is the answer. I work super rural areas as a paramedic, and I 100% would recruit any family present to help with an unexpected home birth. I feel for OP, I do, but that was a super high stress and high risk situation, and OP lucked out to have nurse (especially an L&D nurse) available. It's unfortunate that it didn't go as planned, but shit goes wrong even in the best of times.", "What about after the birth?\n\nWhen the paramedic was there, he opened the door and allowed MIL in without checking with OP if she was ready to have people in yet", "NAH because this is a conflict between OP and her husband. \n\nHe made wrong decisions during a moment of incredible stress and panic.\n\nWanting marriage counseling is fine, but staying in separate places with a newborn until appointments open up is taking things too far. Even if he is visiting every day he is missing out on a lot of the first months of his child\u2019s life.\n\nMIL and SIL are both assholes, mostly MIL. Their contact needs to be limited until OP and their husband can go through some counseling and he learns to better to stand ip for her.", "He let his mother in to SPECTATE. How on earth can you say that's not an AH move?", "OP - I think what you are really annoyed with.

I also know that him letting MIL in after the fact is a real sticking point, but she is his mom. Sometimes people take comfort in their mom's presence during high stress times and she was right there. Was it the right decision? No, but everyone reacts to stress and trauma differently.", "I think him allowing mil in afterwards is more of the problem with op. She stated she understands why he called for sil. However allowed mil in later when op didn\u2019t say to", ">\\- SIL left the door open during my birth, not my husband. MIL and SIL have been telling people the story of my birth, graphically, ever since.\n\nFrom the edit, I'm going to say there are at least two assholes here.", "So why on earth did he let MIL in after the birth? His wife was already traumatized and had told him not to", "I\u2019d say it\u2019s more of a ESH- everyone sucks here.\n\nThe husband panicked, rightfully so. He called in his SIL, an L&D nurse to help. OP panicked and started screaming and pushing the absolutely one qualified person out. MIL for obviously not minding her own business during this clearly traumatic time. \n\nI\u2019d say it\u2019s arguably more about him letting the MIL in before OP was comfortable. But that needs to be addressed with couples counseling and it seems to be an ongoing issue from before. \n\nOp, you should also seek some counseling for yourself with someone who might work with or specialize in traumatic births. That might help. It might not help with your husband, but it might help you continue to process, sort, and cope with your child\u2019s early arrival into this world.", "He also allowed MIL in when Op was with the paramedics without asking if she was ready for a visitor \n\nI get the dude was panicked but all he did the entire time was make things worse for OP, ignore her wishes and allow his family to gawk at her", "As a currently new first time mom, I fully agree. OP, don't punish your husband and child during what could be a PPD / post partem anxiety period for you. Your feelings may pass, but your baby and husband can never get this precious first hand newborn experience back.\n\nAlso it is good for the baby to have skin on skin contact with both mom and dad. Harder for your husband to do this at your mother's house.\n\nNAH but Y T A if you continue to limit your husband's access and fail to bottle train immediately reading these comments.", "I can understand him calling for his sister somewhat but there's no reason to let MIL in there, especially after he was repeatedly told not to do that exact thing.", "Assuming this is his first child, his mother likely knows more about birthing babies than him.  It isn't totally unreasonable that she wanted to help, and husband thought that she could.  Also, sil should have been in that room from the beginning.

And it doesn\u2019t make them an asshole for not understanding the dangers of a home birth. In her mind, it could\u2019ve seemed like it would go just the same as one in the hospital.\n\nOr, even more likely, what was on her mind was \u201cfuck, this baby is coming out NOW\u201d not \u201chm, how do I want this to go?\u201d.\n\nShe acted completely reasonably for BEING IN LABOR. It\u2019s a stressful, hard, and extremely intimate moment. Even if her SIL is a nurse it\u2019s understandable that she feels uncomfortable having someone in the family like that see her naked, sweating, and screaming.\n\nAlso, the title doesn\u2019t really fit because she did mention in the rest of the message that she loves her husband and doesn\u2019t want to divorce him.", "Consider reading the post again.", "\u2026read the edit.", "Honestly being away from OP 50% of the time would probably be the best thing for the kid.", "Yes and no, 50/50 is usually achieved after the first 3 yrs, but that depends on the state.", "Totally agree with you.", "Please tell me what his mother would have done to alleviate the risk of births at home once baby was born", "She didn\u2019t try to have a home birth.", "Yea\u2026 I thought I\u2019d be the only one with YTA from what I was reading on here but honestly you were trying to push everyone away including the labor and delivery nurse which seems completely illogical and unsafe given the emergency nature of your birth.  I understand why he would have thought you wouldn\u2019t mean what you said during labor when you were saying and doing things like that.  Wanting privacy is understandable, but not always possible.  And you were both running on adrenaline.  I understand talking about it and setting some distance for awhile for the three of you since you didn\u2019t get that during birth but leaving entirely with your daughter seems extreme, especially with all he would miss in the first few months.
