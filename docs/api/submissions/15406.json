I have three brothers. About a year after the divorce my dad meet his then girlfriend. He moved shortly thereafter from the town me and my brothers live in to a town about 40 minutes away to be closer to his girlfriend (we live in a small country, where 40 minutes is considered a longer drive). About 3 years ago they bought a house 1,5 hour away from the city my brothers and I still live in. Almost every time we all have a family get together/Christmas/birthdays etc., it\u2019s held at my place, no big deal. We split the cost and labor of food and drinks. One other time while making a list of who brings what in our shared FB chat, I forgot to list my dads girlfriend. We talked it somewhat out. \n\nPresent situation: About 3,5 months ago I had my second child, he was christened 2 weeks ago. The weeks leading up to the christening my husband had to travel a lot with work, leaving me alone with both kids, 3months and M5. I was stressed to say the least. The day before the christening our photographer bailed on us. We had to ask a family friend to help us out.\nAt the church when taking pictures everything was chaotic, baby complaining, the oldest impatient. I didn\u2019t get half the pictures I intended to. I forgot to include her in any of the somewhat 10 photos that was taken. \n\nToday my husband and I received a long text message from my dads girlfriend. To sum it up: \nShe feels excluded, not valued. That family means a lot to her, and given that her and my dad are getting married in the autumn (news to me) it\u2019s hard for her to digest the new reality that she doesn\u2019t matter to us. \nSo, here I am, I feel like the worst human ever, while at the same time, I\u2019m having a hard time accepting that I\u2019ve done anything wrong. It\u2019s an honest mistake. And while I respect her emotions and POV, it\u2019s not my responsibility to protect and maintain her emotions.\n\nSo give it to me straight, but gentle, AITA?

Congratulate her on the engagement, and ignore all the other bullshit.  By any chance, is she much younger than your dad?", "They are getting married and you didnt know? Its news for you? \nI Guess She is not the ONLY One excluded.\nYou did not do any on purpuse. But you not knowing about the wedding... Being the Daughter... Wierd\nNta", "NTA\n\nHer \"new family\" is soooo important to her that she forgot to inform you that she and your father are getting married?", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like a really stressful day for you.\n\nYou were not deliberately excluding her, you didn't get to do everything you wanted photo wise.  She is being overly sensitive and seeing a slight without considering who else you didn't get a photo with.\n\nMaybe when you next talk to her mention the others you missed photos with.  Maybe bring up the fact that you were not told about the wedding - something that possibly should have been mentioned previously to the children of the groom, especially if they are very advanced with preparations and have told all their extended friend group/family - however you are not taking it as a slight.", "NTA You had a lot on your plate.", "NTA. It seems like a genuine mistake and you were busy. It may be good for y\u2019all  to sit down and talk some things out if there\u2019s any thing else to talk out.  \nYou also acknowledged and respect her feelings which i think is good. But if you haven\u2019t you should let her know that you respect her. And it seems like maybe there can be ways for y\u2019all to at least communicate more if not see each other more often. Cause it also does suck on your end this is how you found out they were getting married.", "NTA\n\nI think it would be your dad's responsibility to help her get involved in his family, not yours to go above and beyond to involve her. If she doesn't show up with your dad, it's not on you to drag her along. Was your dad on the pictures? Why was she not with him?", "NAH, when the parent of an adult child has a girlfriend/spouse and you aren't close with your parent, so she is not a significant part of your daily life. so naturally they aren't the first thing on your mind. Same story, the father and his girlfriend didn't tell at the wedding, you aren't very close.", "Slight YTA for apparently not being willing to apologize.  It probably would have gone a long way if you\u2019d said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Jane.  Yesterday was crazy with the photographer bailing and I didn\u2019t get half the photos I wanted.  It was never my intent to exclude you, but I am sorry I didn\u2019t make sure you were included.\u201d\n\nYour unwillingness to make that smaller gesture makes me think you have stronger feelings against her than you\u2019re acknowledging here.", "This one is tough, but I will say a light YTA. It\u2019s a perfectly understandable mistake, but of course this girlfriend of eight years is going to feel left out and neglected. And while you were scatterbrained, you didn\u2019t once think about including her. It doesn\u2019t seem like you dislike the girlfriend nor does it seem like she wronged you in any way, so forgetting about her just seems like a simple mistake. But one that shouldn\u2019t be made over and over again.  My advice moving forward: try to intentionally think of her first for the next few family functions.", "NAH. Obviously, you didn't intend to cut her out either time. You are busy, and it's easy for things to slip. So, you are not an AH. \n\nHowever, each time that you forgot someone, it was your dad's girlfriend. She's probably not high on your priority list then, and your mistakes make that pretty obvious. For example, you probably didn't forget to take a picture with your husband's parents, right? They're probably a priority. While you didn't forget your dad's girlfriend on purpose, the reason their feelings are hurt is because she's the one you keep forgetting when it comes to family events. You didn't do that on purpose, you didn't hurt their feelings on purpose, but their feelings are still hurt.\n\nA simple solution to this is to plan a visit with them sometime and talk to them. Let them know you're happy to hear about the wedding in the fall and that you look forward to having a new stepmother. Reassure them you are happy for them and that you have never excluded her on purpose. Remind them you get busy and overwhelmed with the kids and will probably continue to make mistakes, but that excluding her is never something you've done on purpose and never something you will do on purpose.", "YTA mildly. Just apologize", "YTA.  \n  \nShe is in your dads life for 8(!) years.   \nIf you made group pictures including family and she is not in one of them, of course she feels excluded.   \nI think there is also much more going on then just a picture. 8 years is a very long time. If it where just these two situations you mentioning, I don\u2019t think she would complain.", "So she\u2019s been with your dad 8 years?\n\nSorry but YTA, Had she been the cause of your dads divorce I may have understood but given it was a clean slate and she met him a year later and given she\u2019s been a package deal with him for so long now she should be included in family things by now unless there\u2019s a good reason not too\n\nGiven this is now the second time you\u2019ve done this I suspect it\u2019s not going to be easy to make amends with her and she\u2019s got a right to feel upset", "NAH\n\nIf it was an honest mistake just apologise and move on, but I do question how close she is to you since you didn't even knew they were getting married.\n\nYou can just apologise, explain the situation, say they you didn't mean to hurt her and that you value her bc she makes your dad happy", "Share the text with your dad and strongly encourage him to dump her.  This doesn\u2019t look good at all.\n\nNTA", "Based on the info you provided, YTA", "[deleted]", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It doesn't matter if you are with somene for 8 or 18 or 28 years, if you only see their children a couple times a year in large gatherings,  the children aren't going to consider you a close and valued family member.
