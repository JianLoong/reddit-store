It seems like a genuine mistake and you were busy. It may be good for y\u2019all  to sit down and talk some things out if there\u2019s any thing else to talk out.  \nYou also acknowledged and respect her feelings which i think is good. But if you haven\u2019t you should let her know that you respect her. And it seems like maybe there can be ways for y\u2019all to at least communicate more if not see each other more often.

Why was she not with him?", "NAH, when the parent of an adult child has a girlfriend/spouse and you aren't close with your parent, so she is not a significant part of your daily life. so naturally they aren't the first thing on your mind.

It was never my intent to exclude you, but I am sorry I didn\u2019t make sure you were included.\u201d\n\nYour unwillingness to make that smaller gesture makes me think you have stronger feelings against her than you\u2019re acknowledging here.", "This one is tough, but I will say a light YTA. It\u2019s a perfectly understandable mistake, but of course this girlfriend of eight years is going to feel left out and neglected. And while you were scatterbrained, you didn\u2019t once think about including her. It doesn\u2019t seem like you dislike the girlfriend nor does it seem like she wronged you in any way, so forgetting about her just seems like a simple mistake. But one that shouldn\u2019t be made over and over again.  My advice moving forward: try to intentionally think of her first for the next few family functions.", "NAH. Obviously, you didn't intend to cut her out either time. You are busy, and it's easy for things to slip. So, you are not an AH. \n\nHowever, each time that you forgot someone, it was your dad's girlfriend. She's probably not high on your priority list then, and your mistakes make that pretty obvious. For example, you probably didn't forget to take a picture with your husband's parents, right? They're probably a priority. While you didn't forget your dad's girlfriend on purpose, the reason their feelings are hurt is because she's the one you keep forgetting when it comes to family events. You didn't do that on purpose, you didn't hurt their feelings on purpose, but their feelings are still hurt.\n\nA simple solution to this is to plan a visit with them sometime and talk to them. Let them know you're happy to hear about the wedding in the fall and that you look forward to having a new stepmother. Reassure them you are happy for them and that you have never excluded her on purpose. Remind them you get busy and overwhelmed with the kids and will probably continue to make mistakes, but that excluding her is never something you've done on purpose and never something you will do on purpose.", "YTA mildly. Just apologize", "YTA.  \n  \nShe is in your dads life for 8(!) years.   \nIf you made group pictures including family and she is not in one of them, of course she feels excluded.   \nI think there is also much more going on then just a picture. 8 years is a very long time. If it where just these two situations you mentioning, I don\u2019t think she would complain.", "So she\u2019s been with your dad 8 years?\n\nSorry but YTA, Had she been the cause of your dads divorce I may have understood but given it was a clean slate and she met him a year later and given she\u2019s been a package deal with him for so long now she should be included in family things by now unless there\u2019s a good reason not too\n\nGiven this is now the second time you\u2019ve done this I suspect it\u2019s not going to be easy to make amends with her and she\u2019s got a right to feel upset", "NAH\n\nIf it was an honest mistake just apologise and move on, but I do question how close she is to you since you didn't even knew they were getting married.\n\nYou can just apologise, explain the situation, say they you didn't mean to hurt her and that you value her bc she makes your dad happy", "Share the text with your dad and strongly encourage him to dump her.

They are clearly keeping things from you, and as a result are taking your forgetfulness as a tit for tat about things you knew nothing about. I wouldn\u2019t even address her text. I\u2019d text the dad and repeat everything she said but about you not knowing they were getting married.", "NTA. I don\u2019t expect a mom with two toddlers to be super focused on details anyway. It\u2019s always hectic with kids.", "NAH. I don't want to put words in your mouth but I think she's right that she doesn't matter to you and that never feels good to find out. I think you didn't remember her in the pictures because she was near the bottom of your priority list, but it was an accident. That doesn't make you a bad person, or wrong. You should have (and intended to) include her in a picture. You made a mistake, not a malicious exclusion. Based on your history, it sounds pretty reasonable that you're not close to her. I'm working off of little information so there's a lot of room for error, but it kinda sounds like she's more attached to the idea of family being important than any reality regarding your family. I think the most important thing about your next step is figuring out how you feel about that.\n\nIf you want to be closer to her, I'd suggest including her in your weekly calls with your dad sometimes as the easiest way. They just have to put their phone on speaker, it doesn't require extra time from you.\n\nIf you don't want to be close, that's okay. She'll have to deal with that, but it's not your responsibility. Communicating it may be tricky. I think whether you make it explicit or leave it implicit, tell her directly or enlist your dad to nudge her in the right direction, depends on the personalities and dynamics in play. If you want less than she did and she decides that hurts too much and she wants even less or nothing, that's fair. You need to be prepared to respect that. Even if she wants separate holidays, how your dad negotiates that is his responsibility, not her fault (at least, not inherently her fault. Obviously there are ways to become the AH in every situation depending on how she handles it).\n\nI'll tell you my personal experience. My brother and I are very close. My sister and I aren't. Well, we are close whenever she needs to lean on me which is selfish  on her end and drew out my coming to terms with it, but I don't think that's true here. I have accepted that I don't matter very much to her. It hurts in moments like this when I'm thinking about it but I'm mostly at peace with it. \n\nI've made a conscious and sustained effort to adjust my expectations and now I can enjoy things like her coming to visit next weekend without feeling constantly disappointed and let down by the broken promises of better communication. We used to be in a cycle of me expressing hurt, her feeling guilty and experiencing that as an attack (depending on the wording of the text message, you \"feeling like the worst human ever\" may be a case of it not being her responsibility to protect/maintain your emotions) and making excuses/escalating the fight, frosty radio silence until she needed me (cue apology/promises) and then ignoring me again. Now I expect pretty much nothing from her, so everything I get is a plus. I'll be honest, I'm less at peace with it than I was before my niece is born (sis leaned on me really hard during the pregnancy, initiated a lot of deep conversations about her culpability in our golden child/scapegoat dynamic as we talked about parenting and breaking the cycle of abuse and I totally got sucked in again/attached to kiddo), and she will still be dishonest (if well intentioned) about promises but the empty promises/hot and cold are the only part of the situation that she bears responsibility for. The degree to which I prioritize her has a lot to do with our dysfunctional childhood dynamic and is something I am actively working on in therapy. It is not my fault that being a big sister is a disproportionate part of my identity, but it's not hers either. It is my responsibility to deal with now. I think that's even more true in your dad's gf's situation due to meeting as adults and you being the younger one with less control over the relationship (she picked your dad, you had no say in oicking her).\n\nSis/you are not obligated to reciprocate just because of how I/your stepmom feel. Compare it to unrequited romantic feelings. If your coworker declared his love for you, I hope you wouldn't feel guilty about staying faithful to your husband and turning him down. Even if you were single, you wouldn't owe it to him to return his feelings. What you would owe him is consistency. If you turned him down but started texting him emotional confessions, that would give him false hope. I think most of us learn as teenagers/young adults that kind of thing might feel like kindness in the moment but actually draws out the pain. A lot of the societal narrative in my and many cultures about family is basically that it has to be top priority or you're a bad person, but that's not true or healthy. The dynamics and morality of being more invested in a relationship than the other person aren't meaningfully different than a crush or when one friend is a lot more invested than the other, at least not when you're dealing with other adults.\n\nTldr: I think you need to decide what you want your relationship to be and then make sure you're being consistent. Depending on your relationship/their personalities, it might be helpful to have an honest conversation about setting realistic expectations with either her, your dad, or both.", "Seems like no one is communicating here", "NTA. She\u2019s a drama Queen", "ESH. \n\nIt sounds like your Dad and his girlfriend traveled some distance to be there for your son's christening. So she was physically around, right? If your dad was in any of the photos, or you did \"grandparents\" type posing this should have triggered him, you, or someone to notice your dad was standing solo. It's just hard to believe that you honestly forgot someone you care about and easy to believe that you dismissively excluded someone you've made no attempt to connect with and considered unimportant.\n\nHer text was an emotional guilt trip... But she was right too. If it was an honest mistake given chaos, you need to apologize profusely - not defend yourself as innocent. \n\nYou're an adult, you're allowed to not care about a parent's new partner.

It\u2019s an honest mistake. And while I respect her emotions and POV, it\u2019s not my responsibility to protect and maintain her emotions.\n\nYou haven't done anything wrong, it was just an oversight that you forgot her (there was no malicious intent there), and you couldn't have put it in better words: \"It's not my responsibility to protect and maintain her emotions.\" \ud83d\udc4f", "NTA, it sounds like these were innocent mistakes and you weren\u2019t purposely trying to exclude her. It seems like she is creating some weird scenario in her head. \n\nIn terms of advice, in the future involve her more in the planning of the get togethers y\u2019all have. Maybe even throw out a compliment like \u201chey ____ can you bring those deviled eggs again? They were so good\u201d", "YTA because it is, indeed, your responsibility to smooth over things because the issue was your fault. You don't have to prostrate yourself, but an apology is in order if you intended to have her in a photo and forgot.\n\nI've been on the other side of this (at SIL's wedding), and I didn't know if it was a snub or a mistake. You need to tell her it was a mistake because she doesn't know.", "TA.  Congratulate her and your father concerning their upcoming wedding and move on.", "NTA. Wouldn\u2019t your dad and her come as a package deal for contributions- no reason to list them separately. Can\u2019t speak on the picture thing as I\u2019m not religious so I don\u2019t know how those work", "Ah the second wife syndrome.  This happens a lot where they blame someone for something relatively minor.  They want to be included in everything and be accepted unconditionally...that rarely happens.  NTAH.", "Where was your dad when pictures were being  taken? Why did he not remind you or call to his girlfriend? Why did your father not tell you he was getting married to his girlfriend? Seems like a lot of  lack of communication  Just let her know it was an honest mistake.", "Info: while all this chaos was going on at the christening what was she doing? Was she helping in any way\u2026 you know \u2026 as FAMILY should? \n\nInfo answered or not that text was over the top. You just had a baby and adjusting to 2 is a lot. If she truly cared and wasn\u2019t trying to stir the pot she should have called and bring it up she was hurt. Her feelings are valid but her way of expression sent me from no As to NTA.", "Maybe she's feeling like she was going to be involved in a grandma capacity and then when she wasn't included in pics with family felt away about that?", "Unless she's NOT happy to hear about the wedding.  Just saying...", "Was it a long, whiny text or a text explaining her feelings? I\u2019ll tell my friends & family whatever I\u2019m feeling. I get the same from them. Just letting each other know that this is happening and these are our feelings. \n\nI\u2019m not saying you\u2019re the worst person. I didn\u2019t notice that some of my in-laws weren\u2019t in my wedding photos (they went to the restroom) until after I got the photos back. My husband said someone said something but I never heard it. So I have no room for judgement on leaving someone out of pics. I think you should just let her know it wasn\u2019t purposeful. It was an honest mistake.", "Agree with this!", "NTA. If she was fully present, she was capable of seeing how things went down. You seemed a bit overwhelmed by the day. Lots happening there. Simply explain to her what happened and apologize for not including her in the pictures. It wasn\u2019t intentional or meant to cause a rift.", "NTA - You did nothing wrong, especially as a frazzled, overworked mother. I'd go over with some flowers and a bottle of wine and sit down with her and apologize. It WAS an honest mistake, and none of you ever mean to exclude her. Then turn the focus back on her, make her feel special, and do a deep dive into wedding plans (dress, flowers, menu, venue, dancing, etc etc).", "NTA. It sounds like you've had a hectic time. Her message makes her sound whiny. \n\nAlso, why in the world has your father not mentioned his engagement?!", "NTA - Answer with \u201cOh, congratulations. Seems like you\u2019re not the only one \u201cexcluded.\u201d", "NTA. In the chaos of my wedding day, my sister wasn\u2019t included in the family photos with my grandparents. Major regret, but then she went upstairs and I didn\u2019t notice she wasn\u2019t there in the small space!", "Several years ago, one of my nephews got married.  They had a photographer that took the usual hundreds of pictures.  You know how many my husband and I were in?  Zero.\n\nThe photographer went from table to table (there were probably 150 guests) taking pictures.  Before he got to our table he was interrupted (I think for the Best Man's toast) and forgot to get back to us.  Somehow we weren't in the right spot for any of the candid shots, and they didn't do a big \"groom's whole family\" shot, maybe because his bride's family is from another country and only her mom and sister were there.\n\nWhile I would have liked a picture of us from the wedding, I of course realized it was totally accidental.  It seems to me dad's girlfriend is oversensitive.\n\nNTA", "This is someone who you met as an adult and due to distance hardly know.\n\nAnd she \"feels excluded\" because family is so important but only now are you hearing about their wedding.....\n\nNTA", "Lol Reddit fuckin loves age gaps.", "Why didnt her Dad inform her?", "OP\u2019s dad should inform her. I\u2019m not sure why you are blaming his fianc\u00e9e for not contacting his adult children for him.", "I agree with this, NAH, at least with the information given. OP has a reasonable explanation for both issues, so unless there have been other instances where she\u2019s \u201cforgotten\u201d her dad\u2019s girlfriend, she\u2019s not an AH.\n\nAt the same time, dad\u2019s girlfriend can only draw conclusions with the information available to her, and it\u2019s reasonable for her to conclude that the slights are intentional - especially since she\u2019s been in the family for 8 years now. \n\nAll that\u2019s required is for OP to text back (or maybe call?) and assure the girlfriend that it was a mistake, and not intentional. Maybe offer to get some professional pictures made that include her, even though the christening can\u2019t be recreated. The point is that she wants to feel like someone cares and she\u2019s not disposable. If these instances truly were accidental, it shouldn\u2019t be hard for OP to find an intentional way to show that she accepts the girlfriend and considers her at least as part of the extended family.", "How good do you know someone you see 4 times a year during bigger gatherings? (3 bdays, 1 Xmas) I would probably have problems remembering the name (have a really bad memory for faces / names)", "Well, she sees her 4 times a year max (3 bdays and a Christmas meeting). So there probably isn't to much of a relationship. Why doesn't dad step up and gets his SO into the pics when it is his turn? And obviously the older pair doesn't bother about family anyway, when their engagement is only announced / used for such a letter.", "Well, that\u2019s one less thing for Reddit to crap all over their relationship for.  \n\nNTA.", "Maybe she should've let OP, y'kno the mother of the child, know she wanted to play grandma before, y'kno, expecting any thing at all?", "Being forgotten two times, including photos make her text reasonable. Her feelings of being left out are valid. Why are people on reddit always acting like AH?\n\nYTA OP", "That\u2019s what lead me to believe dad may be in dark. I would think he\u2019d tell the kids he was thinking of getting married . Op mentions no animosity . I think GF needs to step back and breathe . I talk to my mother in law frequently and lots of time she initiates talks. Lol \ud83d\ude06 she\u2019s a saint ,but that\u2019s my point she sends as much as she receives . And nobody else mentioned to op that gf hadn\u2019t been in a photo.. not even dad the day of. He could have quietly spoken to op and changes could have been made.", "I don\u2019t feel like it is that way. She\u2019s had two events in 4 years. One was caught and fixed . Op says she usually the host for things so that means all the holidays and etc were fine. I could see if it was a more consistent issue. Yes she can feel how she does but there\u2019s a lot more she would have been left out more of if it was on purpose.", "I'd worry more about how this virtual stranger decided she was gonna get to play grandma to OP's child."]}
