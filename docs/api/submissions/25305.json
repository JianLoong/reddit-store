This place is really the only good Indian place anywhere near us  but it is very pricey, and so we try to keep our order small (1 entree for me, 1 entree for her, and a side of naan bread that we share). The thing is, the side of bread isnt very much, and the entree just isnt the same without it. So it seriously annoys me when she eats the bread without dipping it in her curry. Its such a waste of the little bread that we get. I told her this before but says its not my concern how she eats her food. Except it is my concern because she is wasting a SHARED side. Whatever, I let it go each time. \n\nThis time she didnt order curry like she usually does, she got biryani (rice and meat) so I was happy that I would get the bread to myself. While we were eating, she reaches over for the bread and eats a piece on its own. I got annoyed and moved the bread away from her and told her she doesnt need the bread  since she isnt eating a curry and doesnt need bread whereas I am eating a curry so I do need bread, also that her entree comes with rice and she can eat that. She got offended and ended up threatening not to pay her share for the food next time. She also called me a greedy asshole and took her food and ate the rest in our bedroom.\n\nMy friends are split, one of them says I'm in the right and it's too much carbs for one meal for her to have bread and rice, but the  other friend essentially also called me a greedy asshole.

So the default necessary for curry is rice, not naan, so your logic that \"the one with the curry gets the naan\" is entirely invalid. The price of the biryani is likely in the same range as a curry, so she did pay for the naan if the bill was split as usual.\n\nBudgeting is important, but prices and people fluctuate and adapting is also important. The default Indian take out order needs to be updated to include individual orders of naan.

Okay, so you're deciding, according to your preferences, how bread should be eaten, as if there is an objective answer to that question. Clearly, your gf likes to eat naan on it's own.

This place is really the only good Indian place anywhere near us  but it is very pricey, and so we try to keep our order small (1 entree for me, 1 entree for her, and a side of naan bread that we share). The thing is, the side of bread isnt very much, and the entree just isnt the same without it. So it seriously annoys me when she eats the bread without dipping it in her curry. Its such a waste of the little bread that we get. I told her this before but says its not my concern how she eats her food. Except it is my concern because she is wasting a SHARED side. Whatever, I let it go each time. \n\nThis time she didnt order curry like she usually does, she got biryani (rice and meat) so I was happy that I would get the bread to myself. While we were eating, she reaches over for the bread and eats a piece on its own. I got annoyed and moved the bread away from her and told her she doesnt need the bread  since she isnt eating a curry and doesnt need bread whereas I am eating a curry so I do need bread, also that her entree comes with rice and she can eat that. She got offended and ended up threatening not to pay her share for the food next time. She also called me a greedy asshole and took her food and ate the rest in our bedroom.\n\nMy friends are split, one of them says I'm in the right and it's too much carbs for one meal for her to have bread and rice, but the  other friend essentially also called me a greedy asshole. Its been hours and she's ignoring me. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I do find it's too much carbs, but I don't tell other people (other thsn my child) how they should eat.", "we get so few fucking joys in life.\nLet her have share the ducking naan.", "Firstly, I don't think with the naan it becomes fully 90% carbs, but also, you say you only get this when you have the money for it, which doesn't sound like it's happening every few days or something, so I don't see how she can't have a carb-heavy meal every once in a while. Does she police the nutritional makeup of every single meal you eat?", "You literally think that you get a say in how she eats her food which you don't. She doesn't *have* to dip her bread in her curry & it's not wasteful to eat it how she does. Throwing away a perfectly good piece of naan's wasteful. Eating by itself isn't. Also, it's perfectly fine to eat the Naan that *she* helped pay for even when having rice. YTA for even thinking you have any right to say anything about how she eats *her* food. Apologize & next time just sit there & eat *your* food while allowing her to enjoy her meal without your unasked for opinions on how she does it.", "First you say it\u2019s a small order of naan, and she only wanted to eat half. And now all of a sudden her having 2 starches is a problem because it\u2019s not balanced. If you go to a steakhouse with a free bread basket do you forbid her from eating rolls if she orders a potato? Being controlling about her diet is what makes this misogynistic, as I doubt you tell your male friends how to eat their food when you\u2019re splitting the bill.", "Hm. If she decided to tell you that it's gross to dip the bread in the curry and you can't have any if you're going to eat it that way, how would you feel? Why do you think you're entitled to dictate her eating decisions if she can't dictate yours? What is the difference?", "The fact that you see this as a minor disagreement is actually grasping at straws.  \nIt\u2019s minor to you because you think it\u2019s totally normal and okay to control people like this. \n\nThings like this display of controlling, inconsiderate, greedy behavior are usually exactly the type of thing that gives women the ick so bad they can\u2019t stand to be with you anymore. It seems small to you, and maybe it is overall, but things like this are rarely one off behaviors. They\u2019re compounding issues. I\u2019ll bet she\u2019s been in the room going over all the instances where you have behaved this way or showed these behaviors & deciding if you\u2019re worth it anymore.", "Why does anyone care about a 'treat' being a \"balanced meal'??", "\u201cToo much carbs for her for one meal\u201d is not something you say to or about a woman.", "A minor disagreement that prompted you to:\n\n1.

If their finances are so strapped they can't put in an extra $5 on the order, they probably shouldn't be ordering out at all.\n\nI usually eat about half of my garlic naan plain. It's no different from garlic bread, that doesn't have to be dipped. Plain naan could be analogous to toast with butter, which also doesn't have to be dipped. (Though that's a sad comparison as naan is clearly incredibly superior to typical US-available bread for toast.)", "As much as I think OP is an AH for thinking naan can only be eaten with a curry... I really really want a curry with some garlic naan now. It's in my brain, and the thought of it isn't going anywhere until it's in my stomach. I'm just not going to be stingy about how much naan I get.", "Then I\u2019m going to order extra bread and eat it all on its own, look in the mirror like fuck yeah those extra carbs this one time were absolutely worth the extra booty.", "I live 120 kilometers from the nearest Indian takeaway.  Curries I can make as I stock pile good curry pastes and sauces.  But recently found out that frozen pizza bases cut into sections and brushed with butter and garlic or other spices make very good naan substitutes, quick to bake and a good texture.  Not as good as the real thing, but close.", "You know what, though? My child loves to mix her butter chicken in with rice and put it on her naan like an Indian pizza. It brings her so much joy that I\u2019m not about to give her an eating disorder by policing her carbs.", "Oh, I get that one, but if I get takeout, it's hopefully not a common occurrence (which this sounds like it isn't), so I can go a little heavier on the carbs. Also, we don't know how much rice there is in these serves, and if she eats all of it, instead of potentially eating most of the protein but leaving some of the rice (which is often how I eat takeout servings because they put more rice in than I'd like).\n\nAlso, as you say, you just don't tell other people how they'll eat.", "\ud83e\udd86\ud83e\uded3", "He didn\u2019t want to throw it away, he just wanted it all for himself (while she still paid for half)", "As an Indian, if naan and rice is scaring him, then he would be absolutely horrified to see how many carbs we eat on a daily basis.
