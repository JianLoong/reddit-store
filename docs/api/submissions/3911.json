The woman is now dad's wife and she showed up at our door 8 months pregnant at the time. As you can imagine the divorce was not amicable or friendly in the slightest. My relationship with my dad also changed. I had been a real daddy's girl but ever since I don't feel the same about him. He destroyed my family, hurt my mom, betrayed me too and left me to deal with my parents divorce and a new baby coming into the picture in almost no time at all (3 weeks after his now wife showed up at the door my half sister was born).\n\nMy parents ended up sharing custody of me. I've always wished I had far less time with my dad. I don't like or trust him and his wife. I have grown fond of my now 6 year old half sister and my 4 year old half brother. Though I'm not super involved in their lives either because that would mean more exposure and time with dad and his wife.\n\nSo I'm graduating in June 2023 and my half sister has talked about how excited she is. She then started talking about family photos and how our whole family would be in photos for the first time. I think she was trying to say family unit. But she's 6 so probably doesn't get it. I told my dad he needed to explain that we have different families and her idea (which is her grandparents and her mom's brother as well as her parents and brother) of who will be there and what family photos will look like for me are different. He said she wasn't wrong and his wife and her family are part of my family unit also. I told him they were nothing to me. When he still wouldn't do it I tried to get his wife to talk to her daughter but that was a fail.\n\nSo when she brought it up again I explained that our families looked a little different and how her grandparents and uncle were not my family. I explained I had my own family through my mom. She asked if her mom was my family and I told her no, but that she and half bro are, even if it is different between me and them than it was between the two of them. She got it. She asked if I wanted to have her family too because she'd share. I told her I was good. When she wasn't bringing it up anymore dad and his wife asked her about it and she told them I explained it to her. Now they're saying I'm an AH and it wasn't my place.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670140832, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc3zrk/aita_for_telling_my_half_sister_something_her/", "score": 3792, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your half sister seems to adore you (since she asked if you wanted her side of the family because she'd happily share, and she's excited about your graduating) and they're too little to understand your dad's wrongdoing. That way she gets a picture to proudly display her older sister if she desires to, and your dad and stepmom can't argue that there are \"no family pictures\" (I do admit this might come from personal experience.

It takes ages for kids to sort all this out in their heads - I remember when my brother and sister were little having to endlessly go round and round 'Your dad is my dad too, but my mum is different to yours, and lives where you pick me up from at the weekend'\n\nWe're now 51, 41, and 40, and my lovely little sister is one of my favourite favourite people, so I feel lucky.", "NTA- you sound like an amazing sibling. You put the blame where it belongs, with the parents, and treat your siblings with kindness and understanding.", "[removed]", "NTA, you handled this incredibly maturely and sensitively.", "NTA. You handled this beautifully and in terms a child of her age can understand. You father and his wife are T A. She's going to find out eventually exactly what's what, and you did her a kindness by explaining it in a simple, non-judgemental way.", "NTA", "NTA. I think you explained it to her well in a way a 6 yro could understand and that didn\u2019t hurt her feelings or upset her. \nI don\u2019t know why your dad and his wife take such an issue with it. As your half sister gets older she may ask more questions and maybe your dad and his wife aren\u2019t looking forward to that conversation, but at the end of the day they are the ones that broke up one family unit and will have to face those consequences as their children get older and ask questions about the family dynamics on both sides.", "Nta\n\nYou are a shining star! And the best thing your little half siblings have going for them. \n\nWhat a little cutie, she'll share her family with you! OP, it really sounds like you are the mature one. I have a feeling you've got this!", "NTA.  You did a good job explaining it to her.  Very age appropriate.   I\u2019m glad you don\u2019t hold any resentment towards you half siblings.  Your father and his wife are both assholes though.", "I never understand parents not explaining shit to kids or explaining it incorrectly. Like, there are other people who interact with your child who are going to explain it factually so you may as well just be honest from the get go.", "NTA. My sister was also six when I graduated. We had to explain this as well. My mom and her mom are not the same person. Honestly, I\u2019m curious how they made it this long without explaining it. As soon as my sister picked up on me calling her mom by her name rather than \u201cmom\u201d she asked about it. You were kind in your answer, it was age appropriate. You did a great job!", "NTA and I'd say you're already being quite amicable and kind in a terrible situation.", "OP is a really sweet sister. Affirming that her half sister and brother are still family, even if their moms aren\u2019t the same? My heart is melting. What an amazing sibling!", "They said it's not her place, but they themselves wouldn't do it lol\n\n\n\nNTA", "There is one adult in that house. it is the OP.  \n\n\nNTA", "Wait until little sis is old enough to do math. She\u2019ll get the details without having to be told. Big sis did well. Much more mature than dad & stepmom.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

They don't know just how lucky they are.  NTA.", "It melted my heart that OP was so kind to and honest with the 6yo too! What her dad did was hurtful and it's understandable when a kid her age rejects the children of the new union as well, particularly the child who specifically was involved in the break up of the original family! Dad and AP are seriously undeserving of what a gift they have in OP.", "So if a child tells you the sky is green you wouldn\u2019t correct them because it\u2019s not your place? \n\nYou\u2019re also incorrect when you said the parents divorce has nothing to do with her - her dad\u2019s side chick showed up OP\u2019s home 8 months pregnant for a confrontation in front of OP, who was a child. Was that her place? Stepmom can\u2019t have it both ways.", "Damn winter allergies (sniff sniff).", "My brother found out at 18 that he wasn\u2019t my dads son and he was mad to put it simply. He found out from some random person (I knew but I have a lot of trauma from his dad and don\u2019t like talking about him) he called my mom and screamed at her. The only person he wasn\u2019t mad at was me and my older sister (who also suffered from his dad) we didn\u2019t tell him details just that it was bad.", "That was so heartwarming \u2665\ufe0f", "That was really sweet. I'm glad OP seems to have e a good relationship with her half siblings. Not any of the kids faults this happened.", "Me too. I hope that OP can keep a lifeline extended to her half sister and half brother. Obviously she needs to protect her own emotional well being first, but I hope she's able to maintain this loving connection with her half siblings.  \nIt always saddens me when the child victim is more mature than the parent because I grew up that way.  I hope OP can go to college and enjoy some carefree fun while exploring their new found independence.", "This is SO true. No matter what it is that was kept from them, whether it's that Santa Claus/Easter Bunny nonsense or Hey, your mother has terminal cancer and will be dying soon. I was annoyed enough when I found out my parents had been lying about the Santa Claus crap, but when they told me that they'd been deceiving me for a year and a half about my mother's metastatic cancer, it was devastating news, combined with the lying. I was nearly 12 when they first found out but pretended everything was fine till one evening when I was 13. I am now 65, and I find that I still do not trust anything that anyone tells me because I think they're trying to 'protect' me from the truth. I know my parents' motives were good, but it was damage that lasted a lifetime for me because you feel that you should be able to trust your parents. And if you couldn't trust them, then you can't trust anyone.", "I also thought this was the parents trying to use the little sister to manipulate OP, which is just so shitty."]}
