The woman is now dad's wife and she showed up at our door 8 months pregnant at the time. As you can imagine the divorce was not amicable or friendly in the slightest. My relationship with my dad also changed. I had been a real daddy's girl but ever since I don't feel the same about him. He destroyed my family, hurt my mom, betrayed me too and left me to deal with my parents divorce and a new baby coming into the picture in almost no time at all (3 weeks after his now wife showed up at the door my half sister was born).\n\nMy parents ended up sharing custody of me. I've always wished I had far less time with my dad. I don't like or trust him and his wife. I have grown fond of my now 6 year old half sister and my 4 year old half brother. Though I'm not super involved in their lives either because that would mean more exposure and time with dad and his wife.\n\nSo I'm graduating in June 2023 and my half sister has talked about how excited she is. She then started talking about family photos and how our whole family would be in photos for the first time. I think she was trying to say family unit. But she's 6 so probably doesn't get it. I told my dad he needed to explain that we have different families and her idea (which is her grandparents and her mom's brother as well as her parents and brother) of who will be there and what family photos will look like for me are different. He said she wasn't wrong and his wife and her family are part of my family unit also. I told him they were nothing to me. When he still wouldn't do it I tried to get his wife to talk to her daughter but that was a fail.\n\nSo when she brought it up again I explained that our families looked a little different and how her grandparents and uncle were not my family. I explained I had my own family through my mom. She asked if her mom was my family and I told her no, but that she and half bro are, even if it is different between me and them than it was between the two of them. She got it. She asked if I wanted to have her family too because she'd share. I told her I was good. When she wasn't bringing it up anymore dad and his wife asked her about it and she told them I explained it to her.
