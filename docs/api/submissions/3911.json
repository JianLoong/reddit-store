The woman is now dad's wife and she showed up at our door 8 months pregnant at the time. As you can imagine the divorce was not amicable or friendly in the slightest. My relationship with my dad also changed. I had been a real daddy's girl but ever since I don't feel the same about him. He destroyed my family, hurt my mom, betrayed me too and left me to deal with my parents divorce and a new baby coming into the picture in almost no time at all (3 weeks after his now wife showed up at the door my half sister was born).\n\nMy parents ended up sharing custody of me. I've always wished I had far less time with my dad. I don't like or trust him and his wife. I have grown fond of my now 6 year old half sister and my 4 year old half brother. Though I'm not super involved in their lives either because that would mean more exposure and time with dad and his wife.\n\nSo I'm graduating in June 2023 and my half sister has talked about how excited she is. She then started talking about family photos and how our whole family would be in photos for the first time. I think she was trying to say family unit. But she's 6 so probably doesn't get it. I told my dad he needed to explain that we have different families and her idea (which is her grandparents and her mom's brother as well as her parents and brother) of who will be there and what family photos will look like for me are different. He said she wasn't wrong and his wife and her family are part of my family unit also. I told him they were nothing to me. When he still wouldn't do it I tried to get his wife to talk to her daughter but that was a fail.\n\nSo when she brought it up again I explained that our families looked a little different and how her grandparents and uncle were not my family. I explained I had my own family through my mom. She asked if her mom was my family and I told her no, but that she and half bro are, even if it is different between me and them than it was between the two of them. She got it. She asked if I wanted to have her family too because she'd share. I told her I was good. When she wasn't bringing it up anymore dad and his wife asked her about it and she told them I explained it to her. Now they're saying I'm an AH and it wasn't my place.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1670140832, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zc3zrk/aita_for_telling_my_half_sister_something_her/", "score": 5917, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's messed up that they say it's \"not your place\" when they were given the opportunity to explain things in a way they were comfortable with. I thought you handled it pretty gently. It's sweet that she wants to share her family because she loves them, they're all she's ever known as her family, and she wants you to be happy and feel loved too.

Your half sister seems to adore you (since she asked if you wanted her side of the family because she'd happily share, and she's excited about your graduating) and they're too little to understand your dad's wrongdoing. That way she gets a picture to proudly display her older sister if she desires to, and your dad and stepmom can't argue that there are \"no family pictures\" (I do admit this might come from personal experience.

She asked a question and you answered kindly.", "NTA\n\nPeople often underestimate small children, and I never understand why. \n\nWere you supposed to let your sister continue to misunderstand? Children ask questions because they are ready for the answers (appropriately explained of course).\n\nYou kindly explained it and she understood. It sounds like you two have a sweet relationship.\n\nIt sounds like your dad and his wife have unresolved feelings about everything that happened, and probably don't want to face their parts in hurting other people. They were afraid of facing judgement.\n\nHowever, you were kind, and did not talk about any of that. You simply explained everyone's relationships. I think you did a great job.", ">She asked if I wanted to have her family too because she'd share.\n\n\nAwww, kids are adorable. NTA.", "NTA- you were the adult and your Dad and his wife weren\u2019t. Your half sister would have been confused and possibly hurt if it wasn\u2019t explained to her. And I will congratulate you on how well you explained it for the little one! \ud83d\udc4f \nWhy would your Dad think his wife\u2019s family was yours as well? I will assume you have never said it alluded to the fact you felt that way because you stated you do not. Sounds like he and the wife would like you to forget how their family unit was formed. Again NTA.", "#NTA", "NTA. Also she sounds so sweet with offering to share her family with you, shes a little confused but shes obviously understanding", "Awhh you\u2019re so precious! You sound like the best big sister! \n\nNTA, your siblings are so so lucky to have you", "You're a smart, good kid and your half sister is lucky to have you in her life", "NTA- I think most the comments cover my thoughts exactly. \n\nI don't like the idea that they are trying to force your stepmoms family on you.

You sound lovely girl. Those kids are lucky", "NTA, kids are smarter that you think. Great explanation OP.", "NTA. Honestly, I think it\u2019s mighty presumptuous of your father and stepmom to think you would want stepmom\u2019s family at your graduation.

She is of an age where ahe can understand tis stuff and has classmates who are in the same situation. I don't kniw what game your dad and step-mom are playing at but my best guess is that they are either being manipulative or they don't eant to face that they broke up your family and they want to pretend that what they did was \"good\" for you.", "NTA, let dad know what you said, and what you could have said. Then go to mom's. Let him marinate on it for a while.", "I honestly think it wasn\u2019t your responsibility to explain this to her, it was your dad\u2019s.

If they don\u2019t like it, they should have explained it themselves when you told them it came up.", "NTA I was expecting that you went into her mom and your dad's affair and how that ruined your family, but that wasn't what happened at all. It sounds like you explained the family genealogy very well so that she could understand without any negative connotations to it. This helped her understand the family dynamic without it being upsetting. Your dad and his wife are assholes all the way around.", "NTA. Not at all. You did great explaining to a child. Parents are freaking because they don\u2019t plan to tell her the real story when she\u2019s older.", "NTA. Your dad and step mom are bpth assholes. Now that you are older, can't you choose to not stay w your dad?", "I want to add that it's absolutely adorable how she asked if OP if she wanted to have her family bc she would share. That was incredibly sweet. That comment also shows that she does understand what was explained to her and that she hasn't learned hate yet. I really hope that dad's and wifes attitude about it don't turn it into that.\n\nOP you did an excellent job. You tried to get thebadults to be adults and parent their child. They refused. You waited for her to bring it up, and explained the issue in an age appropriate way. One that also protected her view of her parents, and that's important. How she came to be is not her fault and she shouldn't have to deal with the emotions that go with what happened. \n\nOp, as long as they don't take it out on your sister, and try to twist things, let your dad and his wife be mad. You did nothing wrong, you handled it beautifully. She may be to young to realize it, but you also showed her that you are someone she can come to when she needs to know the truth. I'm sorry for the heartbreak that you went through. I honestly think that a lot of parents don't understand how things like that can betray the child's trust, and that's where some problems come from when dealing with situations like this.

She insisted Santa was real. My response was something like \"UGHHHHHHHHHH, I can't believe you lied AGAIN! Santa MAKES NO SENSE!\" 30 years later, I still have trouble trusting people, and my mom specifically. It was more about the fact that i had somehow seen through the curtain, and yet my mom wanted to convince me i was wrong and so told me to not trust myself that I found so distasteful and offensive.", "NTA sounds like you\u2019re the one being the responsible adult here.
