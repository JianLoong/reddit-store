The woman is now dad's wife and she showed up at our door 8 months pregnant at the time. As you can imagine the divorce was not amicable or friendly in the slightest. My relationship with my dad also changed. I had been a real daddy's girl but ever since I don't feel the same about him. He destroyed my family, hurt my mom, betrayed me too and left me to deal with my parents divorce and a new baby coming into the picture in almost no time at all (3 weeks after his now wife showed up at the door my half sister was born).\n\nMy parents ended up sharing custody of me. I've always wished I had far less time with my dad. I don't like or trust him and his wife. I have grown fond of my now 6 year old half sister and my 4 year old half brother. Though I'm not super involved in their lives either because that would mean more exposure and time with dad and his wife.\n\nSo I'm graduating in June 2023 and my half sister has talked about how excited she is. She then started talking about family photos and how our whole family would be in photos for the first time. I think she was trying to say family unit. But she's 6 so probably doesn't get it. I told my dad he needed to explain that we have different families and her idea (which is her grandparents and her mom's brother as well as her parents and brother) of who will be there and what family photos will look like for me are different. He said she wasn't wrong and his wife and her family are part of my family unit also. I told him they were nothing to me. When he still wouldn't do it I tried to get his wife to talk to her daughter but that was a fail.\n\nSo when she brought it up again I explained that our families looked a little different and how her grandparents and uncle were not my family. I explained I had my own family through my mom. She asked if her mom was my family and I told her no, but that she and half bro are, even if it is different between me and them than it was between the two of them. She got it. She asked if I wanted to have her family too because she'd share. I told her I was good. When she wasn't bringing it up anymore dad and his wife asked her about it and she told them I explained it to her.

What more can anyone ask for?", "NTA at all, you're a good big sister. Seriously, good job on not having any animosity towards your half siblings. Idk if I could be that big of a person. You didn't say anything inappropriate, you explained it truthfully in a way a 6 year old can comprehend. Good job.", "Good for you. The fact that she understood you and trusted your explanation speaks volumes about your relationship with her. It's great that you have such a healthy relationship with your half siblings. NTA", "NTA I\u2019m so proud of you, you explained that EXTREMELY well better then so so many middle aged adults would have and while explaining that your families look differently you also reinforced that she and your younger brother are still your family and that their relationship might look different to yours with them and that\u2019s all okay I just for a 17y/o you did so well and I\u2019m so proud of you. Well done Bub!!!", "I love how you explained the family situation.\ud83d\udc9d", "NTA. Her parents should\u2019ve done it when she started asking questions.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nNeither parent talked to her when you suggested it.  You did a good job explaining it to her without drama.  Period.  She knows now, cool with it and your dad and step mother? TA.", "NTA and it sounds like the six year old is a sweetheart and wasn't negatively impacted by the information", "Nta and also great job explaining to her!", "My parents took the term \u201cgo forth and multiply\u201d a little to literal. I was 16 when I found out I had 5more half siblings. It was a shock but they are great I love them all. My Dad recently married a girl my age. It\u2019s so cringe. She wanted kids and  was pushing the idea on to my dad. Fortunately he didn\u2019t have kids with her. They are raising her niece because her sister died. Which is great. NTA, for being far more adult about this situation then your Dad and his wife.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, I thought you were going to reveal the affair, which at her age would have been shitty.\nBut she's old enough to get that even though you're related you have different families. JUST old enough, but that's also likely why she was asking. She's noticed you're her family, but aren't there for lots of family stuff and needed to check her understanding.\n\nI'm hazarding a guess that your dad and the other woman think you revealed their dirty laundry tho, and that's why they're upset.", "NTA Your sister understood and was not upset. Bravo. Half the people on this sub have parents lying and siblings rejecting them. Your sister is ok and she will not go through any of that because you explained it perfectly. Sometimes kids explain things to other kids better than any adult could do it.", "NTA at all. You asked dad and step mom to take care of it, and we're incredibly kind about explaining things when they didn't.", "NTA her parents didn't want to explain it to her and you did it in a very child friendly way that she understood without dragging anyone through mud", "NTA. I think that was very sweet. You nicely explained that you\u2019re still family, but your families are a little different and that\u2019s ok. My little brother is technically my half brother and we procrastinated telling him I had a different dad for so long (I didn\u2019t have contact with bio dad for various reasons). After my bio dad died and I finally decided to meet my half sister (his daughter) my mum told him. He didn\u2019t even flinch. Just \u201coh ok\u201d and that was that. Kids are so understanding and can accept more than we give them credit for. He keeps calling her my \u201clong lost sister\u201d it\u2019s pretty funny, but our relationship hasn\u2019t changed.\n\nKids need to learn that some families look different to others and that\u2019s ok. Some people have step families, some people have single parents, half siblings, foster siblings. I think you explained it beautifully.", " NTA - I have a much older sister, same mom, different dads. She also has another sister around the same age as me but they have the same dad, different moms. I have always understood that her dad and sister aren\u2019t mine, but that I was still her sister and same with her other sister. There is just as much love between the two of us and the two of them as if we both had the same parents, it\u2019s just different.\n\nYou explained in a way that didn\u2019t upset her and that\u2019s really the main thing, she was okay. Kids are pretty matter of fact, explain like it\u2019s not a bad thing or a good thing, just a thing, and they\u2019ll treat it that way unless it\u2019s told in a way that hurts. Seems like you just saved the two of you a bit of heart ache since your shared parent wasn\u2019t willing to just say \u201chey, y\u2019all have different moms, some family is shared, same are only hers and some are only yours\u201d", "NTA sounds like a kind, productive, and appropriate conversation. Your little sister sounds like a sweetheart, and I hope you guys grow up to be good friends.", "Something that I never understood in post's like these is why the father or mother cheats in the first place ? Like what's the point of breaking your own family just to create a new one ?\nBTW nta.", "NTA, and you are a good sister :)", "NTA, at the age of 5 my cousin told my sister and I that my older siblings were from a previous marriage (mother's side) and we don't share blood. it wasn't something hard to understand and somehow we knew because they weren't always there and visited us on vacations. and after our parents confirmed it, it was easier for us to explain things. for example at first grade they would ask us about our siblings, and knowing that I answered that I only had 1, because that was legally the truth.\nthe sooner, the better.", "Nta\n\nYou explained it in a way a child would understand without making her upset. Your dad and his wife may have been pushing these views on her and thats why they didn't want to explain it.", "NTA. Won\u2019t lie, my heart kinda melted a little when I read the part that she would share, that\u2019s a very sweet offer from a little girl who loves her big sister.", "NTA you parented the situation because the actual parents in this situation failed to. And you did it in an age appropriate way. Your father and his wife are just upset because you proved to be the only adult in the situation.", "NTA", "Your dad and step mom are saying it wasn't your place to tell her is so hypocritical.  She thought it was her place to pop up on your doorstep at 8 months pregnant, while you were 12 and rip your family apart and clearly with dad's consent. I say, at least you did it with class and grace.\n\nNTA", "NTA they were trying to pull the forced family unit thing since you don't see your step mother or her family as family.", "NTA.  \n\nYou told your sister the truth, at an appropriate age.  They should have, and didn't.  Your dad is trying to pretend that his actions didn't matter, that the people he now views as family are also your family.  That's wrong, for him to push this view on you; it's disrespecting reality and your feelings.  Guessing that his motivations have a lot to do with him justifying his behavior to himself, and trying to pretend that his actions didn't affect you.  Again, very wrong for a parent to do that to you.", "INFO: Did anyone tell them exactly what you said or do they think you told the kid about her pregnant mom showing up at your door and destroying your family?\n\nIf they know what you actually said, they\u2019re being ridiculous because the way you explained it was considerate and age appropriate. If they don\u2019t know, you should probably let them know before they start trying to justify their affair to a six year old. \ud83d\ude2c", "NTA", "NTA \n\nWow, I am impressed at your emotional intelligence here. You explained it very clearly in an age appropriate way. \n\nBasically, you did your dad\u2019s job. \n\nHe\u2019s completely abdicating his parenting responsibilities. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with all of this.", "NTA you apparently did an excellent and very gentle job of explaining the separation points in a way she can grasp and doesn't see as hurtful. Kudos to you sweet girl. As you already know, your dad and step mom are TA here for avoiding discussing a subject with their very bright 6 year old that clearly was NOT hard for her to grasp when explained lovingly and properly.", "NTA\n\nYour reality is different from her and you were sensitive to her age as you explained it to her.  Dad getting upset is his own crap and this wasn't about him but the girl.", ">you explained nicely w\n\nThis!

Excellent work OP, you're more emotionally intelligent than most of the adults around you.", "Perfectly handled. No notes. \n\nNTA. \n\nThe kid sounds so sweet.", "Honestly, it sounds like part of refusing to explain it was them trying to use their poor sweetheart of a little girl to try and force OP to at least put on a show of accepting the AP and her family. So this was honestly the kindest thing OP could do for her sister and herself, explain it kindly and honestly so they can't use her for that bullshit anymore.", "NTA. \"You're very gracious towards her\" Perfectly described. From the title and the initial of the story i was afraid of \"how\" OP told her half sister, but at the end of the story i was glad that OP did everything with all the care and love in the world, not only you are NTA but you are a good sister, congratz OP.", "Why are more people not commenting on this. Sis it innocent and adorable.", "Wow someone got you good didn\u2019t they. The rage is wonderful.", "How is explaining the family tree taking away someone's innocence?", "My half brother grew up always knowing that my full brother and I have a different father. Children can handle these kinds of things way better than you give them credit for. In fact, exposing them family units beyond the nuclear family at a young age, makes it easier for them to grasp it.", "Yep, it sounds like OP really loves her little sister and is honestly the least likely to go throwing shade at other people while attempting to explain the dynamics of this family. There's no telling how dad and the AP/stepmom would have referred to OP's mom and additional extended family while trying to explain it. OP sounds like an awesome big sister.", "Found the cheater.", "I guess you are one of those that have affairs.\nIt should not be the norm if you really respect your partner or your spouse.

Stepparents are not legally connected through marriage. Ain\u2019t no legal ties, just emotional ones\u2026which they do not have. So, yeah, no connection."]}
