So either of you taking care of her - which sounds like an absolute 24 hour responsibility, not just helping out here and there - would mean a lifetime commitment, at the very least making it difficult, maybe impossible to have kids, a regular family life. And she is not your or your brother's child. From what you wrote it seems that your sister's problems were there since birth. So it would've been your parents' responsibility to figure out right at the start what will happen if they can no longer take care of her. It should not be yours or your brother's job to find a solution. It feels like you love your sister, and so does your brother and even SIL. But loving someone and giving up a huge portion of your life is not the same. In my book you should shoulder the responsibilities that you took on willingly. That means kids and partner. Everyone else you can choose to help but you can't be expected to. \nNot to mention you seem to have ample health issues yourself. I doubt that you physically would be able to care for her forever. Your SIL will have a baby soon who will need her so she's out. Dad is disabled himself. I'm assuming your brother works too much to be there all the time. So as much as it sucks, it might be better for her to have the seemingly unavoidable trauma of the change and hopefully get used to it, than to spring it on her when she's older and everyone - to put it bluntly - died out around her.", "NTA \n\nYour family is in a horrible predicament, and I'm so sorry. \n\nBut you and your brother are not in the wrong.  You're completely overwhelmed,  and have been for a while.
