Your children deserve better. \u201cMom if you are going to hold seeing your grandchildren over my head as a way to get me to drop the OOP\u2026you are sorely mistaken.

End conversations when it turns to this. \"I'm not discussing it it. Goodbye.\"", "NTA. You have to protect yourself and your unborn child (not to mention the rest of your family).

Let the no contact order run its full time.", "NTA and a neutral judge heard both sides and said it was necessary. Often times, families excuse or dismiss grossly toxic behavior.

Don't let them.", "NTA.  You are a parent now.  It is your job to protect yourself and your children.  This is non-negotiable.

He just wants you back to control and hurt you more.\n\nKeep your family safe. Honestly I would speak to lawyer about filing a more permanent restraining order against him to ensure that nothing expires. \n\nAs for your mom and sisters, either they have sided with your abuser or they are being manipulated/controlled by him.

You can tell them \u201cI am not letting my father anywhere near me or my kids again. He is abusive and his actions put me in the hospital. I will not allow him to endanger me or my kids.

He needs to be held accountable for whatever he did! \n\nThis protection order is for yours and your children\u2019s safety! It\u2019s your job as their mother to protect them. Honestly, I\u2019d cut them all off if there willing to make you the bad guy for whatever your father did. Clearly your father has issues and needs treatment of sorts.

There is a reason for the protective order, and everyone on ur dad's side sucks", "NTA\n\nTo me it sounds like he is not very long in his anger management classes. I would consider it after he completed them, and only if you want it, and under strict safe environments, and then just a littke tiny bit. Do not let your family guilt you. He deserved that order, right? Your husband is right to prioritise the safety of you and your kids!", "NTA\n\nThere's never a valid reason to get violent with someone.", "NTA Do not let them pressure you.  My children's father and my ex was very abusive.  I was so blind and brainwashed that I thought as long as bla bla bla happened he would stop.  He says he's sorry and loves me.  Then the next time same, 24 years, by the last 5 years I was so depressed and riddled with anxiety, I couldn't function at all.  \n\nHe was arrested and CPS called, more bla bla, and we let him come back, over and over and over.  Now that we are free from him (It took a long time) We are getting better, lots of therapy, lots of learning how to recognize the triggers.  \n\nYour mom and siblings are still under the spell.  They don't know how to get away, he still has their minds under his control.  Do not drop this, they may be able to escape if her goes to jail.  Even then he may have them in his control.  My Ex had us so droned out that we would go bail him out, pay for the lawyers, it was stupid and delusional of me.  I am so grateful I was able to get away, mentally and physically. \n\n Be present for them if they escape, but until then, maybe keep your distance for you and your children.", "NTA  Your father hurt you enough to send you to the ER.  He was obviously physically abusive and was arrested and put in jail.  A judge felt that a restraining order was in your best interest to protect you.  Now your family wants you to drop the RO for their convenience, not for your safety.  Under no circumstances should you ever allow this man to be near you or your children again.  You have the right to feel safe.  Your mother and sisters attempts to bully and guilt trip you into dropping the RO are appalling.  Shame on them!  For the safety and well being of you and your children do not cave into their demands.", "NTA. How does any of your family's reasoning keep you and your kids safe? That's what every adult should be thinking about and it seems that you and your spouse are the only ones who are doing so. Dropping the PO for their convenience doesn't keep your kids safe.", "Sorry... but fuck no!  Do not drop that thing.\n\nYour dad, and by extension mom and sibling, are abusive. They are trying to guilt you into dropping the order by appealing to your nostalgic side.\n\nSeriously, I would sit your mom down and tell her point blank \"I want you to have a relationship with your grandchildren, but I will absolutely not compromise their or my safety. Dad is cut off forever. And if you side with him or keep pressuring me to drop this, I will go no contact with you both\".\n\nYou are in the right. Absolutely do not drop the order, no matter what guilt trip your mom or sister lay on you.", "NTA and your mom and sisters suck.", "Nta. Look, whatever your dad did that was bad enough to be arrested and for you and your children to be given protective orders. I wouldn't want someone like that anywhere near me. If your family can't come to terms with it, that's their problem. Your husband is looking out for the safety of his family, please don't let the guilt of those supporting the abuser dissuade you in keeping the order standing.", "NTA. I\u2019m in a similar situation. I refused to give my sister money. So My sisters boyfriend beat me so bad that the police gave me a lifetime protection order. My sister has been bugging me to drop it that it\u2019s staying in his record. This man has done nothing to change. They won\u2019t change. I refuse to drop it. You shouldn\u2019t have to drop it when it comes to your safety and your child\u2019s. They can\u2019t see your dads actions have consequences. They don\u2019t wanna believe what he did.

For me, that would be a one strike you are out forever thing.  Your mother (who must know what your father is like and probably has borne the brunt of his anger and violence through the years) simply doesn't want to rock the boat.
