If you saw needles scattered around, you'd be justified. If you saw someone ranting and raving, you'd be justified. If you saw someone who was just getting too close to the kids for comfort, you'd be justified. But this person was literally just minding their own business by a church (which makes sense because it's probably one of the very few spots where they felt they safe to settle themselves... like, they didn't set up camp outside a playground or Chuck E Cheese) and you blew that up for them.", "YTA\n\n1. You send your son to a daycare either next to or in the same building as a place that provides addiction support\n2. You are shocked that someone exists whom you assume is seeking addiction support\n3. It dawns on you that your son could see an \u201cepisode\u201d or get a hold of drug paraphernalia, as he attends a daycare you selected next to or in the same building that provides treatment for addiction. \n4. Instead of removing your son from what you have decided is an unsafe situation, you demand a human being who you aren\u2019t certain is causing an unsafe situation be removed because you have concluded it\u2019s likely they might somehow cause an unsafe situation whilst seeking the services you knew were offered when you chose / dropped your son off to daycare. \n\nWill you also demand the church end it\u2019s support program too? \n\nI mean, you should research your daycare, location, safety protocols BEFORE enrolling. Does the daycare allow kids to play in a parking lot? Do they not have locked doors? If the children can be harmed that easily by someone in a parking lot, the issues is the daycare.", "YTA, and to assume he was an addict without proof make you a major AH. There is an increase in homelessness because people cannot afford to pay the rents with the income they receive. No one asks to be homeless. Addictions are a disease. We all have a right to housing and if we don't to be near resources that will help us. I am guessing the reason this individual picked this spot was because it was safer than anywhere else. So congratulations in evicting an individual from their home. \n\nSomething to consider is that a large portion of the US is just one job loss or accident or illness from losing their stable housing. Those without family or friend supports end up literally homeless on the streets. This could easily be you and is that how you would hope to b treated by others? If the person was not presenting a safety risk, then why get involved. \n\nI work with folks experiencing homelessness and housing insecurity. I have assisted addicts, mental health, no disabilities, families, youth, etc. I can tell you the folks have ranged from generational poverty to an individual that had been a Director of Athletics at a D3 school. \n\nOP and others need to spend a bit more time educating themselves before making assumptions about anyone.", "Was the homeless person really a threat to your son, or was he just a threat to the parking lot? Because unless they let children play in the parking lot, there was no way your son, or other children btw, were at risk.  \nEdit to add YTA, because you sound very judgmental and use fake empathy to get people to side with you.", "YTA\n\nYou're making someone's life more difficult based on hypotheticals, not evidence. Plus really if your son ends up playing with needles in a parking lot, that's the fault of his guardians. \n\nI'm very disappointed with the managers for jumping straight to police without finding out if the church could be of assistance first. \n\nI used to manage a library and had to fend of people's complaints about homeless people doing nothing more than using a computer or quietly sitting reading newspapers. People didn't like how they had to exist in the same space it seemed.", "YTA.  And it seems that is the least Christian thing you could have done.\n Call around for an outreach?  Nope.  Just toss his/her broke ass off Christian property because God forbid your child have to see that.  \n\nStatistically, your child walking in the vicinity of a homeless person while holding your hand is significantly less risky than being left alone with church folks (that you probably don't really know) Source: Personal experience.", "YTA.  The church staff is aware there is a tent in the church parking lot.", "YTA\n\nYour son is in daycare, supervised by adults, not in that person's tent. \n\nCongratulations on making the life of someone who is already struggling even more miserable.", "YTA.

I hope if you are ever in such dire straits that people will show you more grace and compassion than you showed. And I hope you feel shame for how you acted.", "Can you expand on HOW this person was a \"potential threat\" please?

It is cruel and wrong  to make up info to influence management to remove the person based on your prejudices.", "NAH. Homeless person isn\u2019t an AH for choosing a church as their location. It makes sense. You\u2019re not an AH for not wanting the situation in the parking lot of your daycare location. It\u2019s not just needles, it\u2019s the potential for being approached while alone with your child and for it to grow into a larger camp. \n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be downvoted. However, you *can* be supportive of homeless and addiction resources while still being concerned about the above situation. It\u2019s up to the church and/or daycare management to handle it. They can deal with it compassionately or as AHs but that\u2019s not on you.", "I\u2019m going to get downvoted to hell but NAH. He may have been perfectly fine but if there was an incident, which happens in Manhattan all the time btw, where say you wake a homeless person up and they are startled and either throw a punch or have a knife, then someone will sue that school because they knew he was there. My heart breaks for the homeless because I see them all day every day but it just takes one time. And this is by a school not next to a random Home Depot. \nAnd all you YTA people, how many shelters and food kitchens do you volunteer at?  Just curious.", "NTA.\n\nThere is so much idealism in the responses here-- homeless people are people too! How dare you not want your kid to go to daycare next to a homeless camp! You're a monster! All of it comes from a well-meaning place, but all of it is just oh-so ignorant to reality. Increasingly in modern society, I keep seeing that the same people who cry out against others for not wanting to deal with homeless people in their daily lives are the same people who don't have to live next to or work next to encampments themselves. They are often wealthy, young, and full of ideals because they haven't actually experienced the brutal realities of these situations.\n\nAs someone who has both been homeless and has lived in a neighborhood with homeless encampments for the past five years, I say you were 10000000% in the right on this one. When one tent is allowed to stay, it's only a matter of time before others spring up. And with homeless encampments come rampant drug use, increased theft around the neighborhood, daily threats to people walking by (I was once threatened with a syringe because I wouldn't give a guy money), and loud noises at all hours. The amount of times I've seen dead bodies is ridiculous. The smell of piss and sh\\*t is overwhelming at times-- it's simply not humane to allow these camps to exist. Most of the time, these are people who have already been offered shelter by the city but refuse to take it for one reason or another. For anyone who disagrees, go work with a homeless organization (a real one where you get your hands dirty-- not some rich people \"pat myself on the back\" org where you just build a community garden or donate money to people you never see) and wake up.\n\nBut back to your situation, OP. It's a lot easier for the city to have one tent removed vs. a whole encampment, so it's best to nip it in the bud while you still can. But let's say that you did just let the tent stay and, miraculously, no other tents sprung up. There would still be a homeless individual living in the lot of your son's daycare. Yes, these people are people too, but they are tremendously unpredictable. He could be perfectly nice one day and then out to stab somebody the next. He could be sober one hour and completely high on ketamine the next. He could go his whole life without stealing from others, until one day he wakes up and decides that society owes him. His health could be stable the morning you drop your son off and in crisis when you come to pick him up. I wouldn't want any of that near my child. I don't want to live near it now, but I unfortunately do, and it's a nightmare. You did the right thing, no matter what all these ignorant idealists are saying.", "Nta. There\u2019s a reason why adults who work with kids need to get criminal record checks and vulnerable sector searches. Adults without these checks shouldn\u2019t be around children. \n\nThere are other places for homeless people to set up camps, that don\u2019t potentially put children at risk. Children\u2019s welfare isn\u2019t something that should be given a backseat to anything.", "Why does being homeless automatically make you an addict who is going to spread needles around? Or a person who has \u2018episodes\u2019?\n\nYou sound like YTA.", "Yta only for assuming that ppl that are homeless are harmful. They're not all harmful. I was homeless for a year and I wasn't doing drugs or drinking- just couldn't afford life and I had a \"normal\" full time job. I understand the concern but I would have talked with admin first", "NTA. You were concerned about your child and with the way the world is now you did what you felt you needed to do. If the church is going to allow homeless people to camp on their property they should have let the parents of daycare kids know. That way you could have asked questions about the security measures at the daycare, or any other concern you had. At the end of the day it is your child being left there, and only you can decide what steps to take.", "INFO: you said he was in a tent in the church parking lot. Your son's daycare is in a church, then? Or do the church and your son's daycare share a parking lot? What did the non-daycare people involved at the church think of what was happening? \n\nHonestly, if this was a situation where he was camped in a private daycare parking lot, I'd honestly say what you did sucks but it was understandable-- I'm all for no-questions-asked housing the homeless, and I think the idea that the homeless need to be unseen is an asshole thing, but a private business has a right to say \"no camping in my parking lot, this is a childcare center and having an adult hanging around who has no business here is not appropriate\". But the fact that this happened in the parking lot of a Church that is literally known for doing addiction-related community outreach complicates this.", "YTA - the fucks the point of the church if not to provide services for this in need? Doesn\u2019t sound like the guy was being any harm", "YTA. It blows my mind that you can acknowledge this person needed help, and this church is a place where they can get help, but you\u2019re too much of a NIMBY to allow them to be in your sight. Sometimes churches are the only places people feel safe to sleep if they have nowhere to go. You have the power to find a new daycare if you\u2019re so uncomfortable with this person existing near your child. This person has nowhere to go. They aren\u2019t on the playground with your kid. They\u2019re sleeping in a tent in the parking lot. \n\nDo you even go to this church? Or just using it for a daycare? I\u2019m pretty sure most faiths say you\u2019re supposed to care for the sick and poor\u2026 not have them escorted out of your sight by the police.\n\nEDIT: OP has clarified in the comments they lied and this person wasn\u2019t even in a tent. People in comments are saying NTA because when one person puts up a tent it means it will attract a whole camp of homeless people. A single person sleeping on a mat in a church parking lot for the night isn\u2019t going to make the property a whole homeless camp littered with needles. You have every right to be concerned for your child\u2019s safety, but you also have the power to go to a different daycare. I might feel differently if this was a private daycare parking lot.. but it\u2019s a church. That\u2019s why I feel like it\u2019s not your place to decide if they deserve to sleep there or not.", "Lol you know YTA. Check your biases and mind your business. What do you think a person with no home, bare minimum possessions, sleeping in the parking lot is going to do to the daycare children inside the church, exactly? Asshole.", "YTA.  People act the same way in my town.  They insist homeless shelters be taken down in their neighborhoods when there is no evidence that it creates anymore crime than otherwise.  I even had someone on nextdoor neighbor go crazy because they were building lower income housing next to their precious condo.", ">I noticed a tent in the church parking lot. Normally I try to ignore those as they have become increasingly common in Denver as housing prices skyrocket but this is my son's daycare\n\nthis gives a \"not in my backyard\" kind of vibe...\n\n>I just can't risk an episode or needles were my son plays\n\nI'd be more worried if a daycare allows my son to play in a parking lot...\n\nI can understand why you worry but you could have talk to the church and ask if they know the guy or if they're helping him.\n\nYTA", "Not very Jesus of you", "YTA, quite massively. This person is not a threat unless the children actually play in the parking lot, in which case there are bigger issues. Also, you can't risk an episode of what, exactly? You also mention needles, but surely being in the church grounds where there is addiction support runs this risk and it has nothing to do with the guy in the tent. The guy in the tent may have just wanted to be near people rather than alone because homeless people get beaten up pretty often so being in a church parking lot was probably the safest place. YTA, in so so so so many ways.", "Do you know what happens when police are called in these situations? The person's belongings are taken away and disposed of.  \n\n\nSo not only did you have him removed from the area you also likely caused this person to lose all their worldly possessions. What a hero you are  \n\n\nYTA it's not even a question", "YTA. Homeless people aren't inherently threats or even addicts, you're just judgemental and unpleasant - using the police to strongarm people who have nothing, on a whim.", "NTA\nFrom the look of the posts I'm in the minority. But ... if the person had a right to be there and/or to camp on the property then the police wouldn't have escorted him off. Nobody should be considered an AH for making a report with LEOs.", ">This morning as I was dropping my son off at daycare I noticed a tent in the church parking lot. I ended up speaking to the management and they elected to have a police officer come escort them off the property.\n\nNTA. You made management aware of a potential issue and they decided how to handle it. Parking lots are not public spaces where people are invited to come and stay a while.", "NTA\nThere\u2019s a homeless encampment near my house, it spills into my yard often, the number one issue? Electrical fires starting in tents and spreading from there \n\nDepending on your location he may or may not have access to services, if he does, consider that in many Canadian cities the only people turned away from shelter are the worse behaved and actively inebriated", "NTA, but I think you're overstating the risk to your child. Unless the daycare workers let the kids wander in the parking lot, or they let the houseless person wander inside the kids' play area, it's unlikely that any of what you fear will happen. What will happen is that your kid might ask you very uncomfortable questions about why someone is camping out in November in Denver, which is a question all of us need to answer. :-(", "YTA. Your son is being supervised at the daycare, I take it? And he only spends time at the parking lot when he is brought to or from the daycare? He wouldn't come into contact with drugs or needles just by being walked to or from the car.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m absolutely astounded by the Y T A\u2019s going on here.", "YTA - Dude was doing nothing to you besides existing in a way that you didn't like.", "I\u2019m going to be downvoted for this, but NTA. You were (possibly rightfully so) worried about your child. I\u2019m from Seattle where there are a lot of homeless people around. Obviously not every homeless person is dangerous or an addict, but when your bf gets randomly punched on the street by a homeless person, you regularly have to walk on a different sidewalk bc of all the needles near the tents, and occasionally someone whips out their business in broad daylight, you\u2019re going to be wary.\n\nI don\u2019t think you did anything wrong. Then again I\u2019m 30 and have had a few negative experiences with homeless people. I think a lot of people here are really young and maybe haven\u2019t had to experience this.\n\nI should state, I always vote Blue and I sincerely hope that homeless people can get the help they need. It infuriates me that there is even such an housing crisis. But that doesn\u2019t mean any of us should have to compromise the safety of a loved one.", "YTA because it was literally a church, a place that traditionally welcomes everyone in need with open arms.", "Just like Jesus preached.", "NTA.  It is one matter to serve the poor and homeless and another to allow the health and safety issues of a homeless encampment in the parking lot.", "NTA. Safety for your child is a priority and clearly the daycare management shared your concern.", "There is no way to know the homeless person's background or if they pose a threat to the children. Is this someone merely without a home...or do they have a mental illness...have they ever been violent...are the on the sex offender registry? You can't tell just be looking.\n\nWhat you CAN see is there is a person who has no business being there, and who is attempting to make their home on private property. That means the people who are affected- including the parents of the children - have a right to have the questions asked, and to have the person removed. And because nothing is known about the person, having the police come is the right and safest choice.\n\nNTA.", "Don't listen to these idiots calling yta op, I work in a church daycare and my employer would NEVER let a homeless man camp in the parking lot, especially with today's amount of hostility and violence.\n\nThe majority of the people calling you an asshole would have done the same thing had it been their childs daycare parking lot being turned into a homeless encampment.\n\nNta", "Was your child unsafe or were you uncomfortable?", "NTA and probably an unpopular option but I wouldn\u2019t want a man with a home to be hanging around my daycare either, it\u2019s sad he doesn\u2019t have anywhere to go but you have to be cautious with your children. People will literally grab them out of your hands.", "Apparently you are according to Reddit. Who knew homeless camps and daycares make great neighbors and whoever questions that is an evil asshole?", "NTA. statistically the person living in the daycare parking lot is likely mentally ill and/or addicted to drugs.\n\nBut Reddit's going to shit on you for not accepting things like this. Gonna nuke me, too, for saying it. It's okay OP, worry about your son.", "YTA,  an unhoused person is not a threat to your child. And nor are they automatically a drug user.  You scream 'not in my backyard' kind of person.", "NTA. I would have done the same thing.\n\nWhat I find most appalling is the people who think that if the children aren't playing in the car parking area, they should not run into issues with needles, trash, refuse, etc. Do you really think that will stay around the campground?", "NTA. I live in Seattle and we\u2019ve been dealing with this a long time. The only way to deal with it is to stop it before it starts. You did the right thing. Don\u2019t ignore your gut feeling. Whenever they clean up a camp around here, they turn out to be full of stolen goods, drug paraphernalia, sex offenders, criminals, etc. The overwhelming majority of people living in tents in public areas are not good people. They may have started out good, but drug addiction drove them to the place they\u2019re in and it turns them into drug zombies. This is not to say they\u2019re not worthy of our compassion and support, they certainly are. However, it is NOT a help to someone to let them sleep in a parking lot.  The best thing you can do for yourself and your child and the person sleeping in the parking lot is to make living life as a drug zombie as difficult as possible. This means move them along frequently and forcefully. If it is left, it\u2019ll turn into a camp.\n\nFor those who say you don\u2019t know that he\u2019s an addict - yes you do. Sleeping on the church steps in a tent is pretty much a guarantee that the person is an addict. People driven out by high housing costs first get roommates, then sleep on their friend\u2019s couches, then move home with their parents, then move to a lower cost of living place, then they take second jobs and apply for section 8, then move into their cars... It\u2018s the addict who goes from warm home to street. This is because they destroy every relationship they have in slavery to their addiction.", "NTA - most homeless people are harmless.  But the rate of harmful behaviour is higher in the homeless than the baseline rate.  So your child is safer now than they were before you made the complaint.\n\nWas this an asshole move?  Maybe... but your responsibility is to your kid and if you have to be an asshole to protect him then so be it.  Is there an yes asshole but who cares option?", "NTA\nYou can help others and be sympathetic,  but still be protective of your child. Many homeless people just need a hand up, but there are still those who have mental issues. I would be wary.", "NTA - it\u2019s not a good place for unhoused people to camped - schools, daycares, playgrounds, etc. I see some people suggesting that you shouldn\u2019t say anything because you didn\u2019t see anything suspicious, but it would be weird if you did surveillance to sus out if he was safe or not-safe - not your business. This is for the property managers and the local police to sort out. So letting them know is the right thing.", "This may be controversial but NTA. Never apologize for trying to protect your child. While I personally don\u2019t care if there\u2019s someone there in a parking lot, my tune would change if there was a daycare within the same proximity.  Even though nothing happened the possibility that something could happen is enough. \n\nThe cops (hopefully) can direct them to some resources that will help them find some proper help that the church may not be able to provide or if the person isn\u2019t comfortable receiving help because of religious reasons they can also direct them to another resource. \nLike I said, don\u2019t ever be sorry for protecting your child. \n\nIf people think you\u2019re an asshole at least you can go to work without having a bad feeling.", "YTA. Homeless doesn't mean criminal-", "NTA- no adult should be camping outside a daycare regardless of housing status.

Doing what\u2019s best for your kid is always the best option.", "I\u2019m going with NTA. You didn\u2019t call the police; the church administration did.

This time he decided to stab one of the tellers 5 times and twice in the neck.(idk if the teller lived or not. I never followed up on those calls because I felt like not knowing always gave my mind a chance to hope the people live rather than find out for certain the outcome.) What\u2019s the lesson here? People, homeless or not, can be docile until they aren\u2019t. That person didn\u2019t belong in the parking lot otherwise management of your church would have said, \u201cwe have an arrangement that he can stay there.\u201d\n\nYou were justified to ask management to remove a person that did not belong on the property.

They stand next to your car, just staring at you. They urinate in front of your kids. The owners of the afterschool activity hired security to help at first.

It's really great that *you've* never felt threatened, but I have and do because I've literally been physically threatened (and one time actually attacked) on many occasions just by being in the vicinity. My neighbors have as well.
