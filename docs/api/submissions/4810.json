I live there as well. \n\nThis year, my boyfriend will spend christmas eve with us. The whole family knows him well as he spends a lot of fime over at my house and met my grandparents various times. \n\nNow, my brothers godfather, lets call him B, recently got a girlfriend who has a small child (2). Lets call this child P. Now, weve never met her before and it was quite a surprise when B called in for a surprise visit to vring over his new gf. No problem, they come over and she brings her child. Or monster. Call it as u prefer. It was absolutely awful. P was crying and yelling every damn time he wasnt allowed to do smth, he threw tantrums, threw himself to the floor. At some point she took him outside. I sighed and said: Oh poor boy... Must have a bad day today hm? To B. And he said: No.. thats his normal self. My parents and me then laughed it a little bit of. \n\nNot much later,P and Bs gf came in again and at some point i tried playing with P, which went surprisingly well and he cried only little times, if i just did what he wanted. He also sat quietly at the table as long as he was on my lap. \nLater at the table, Bs gf then said, that P almost never behaves this well and that shes excited to join us on christmas as I can take care of P so the evening will run smoothly. \n\nI told her, in no way am I gonna play babysitter for her child. She reacted kind of surprised and said, that it would be selfish of me, because it could ruin everybody elses christmas dinner. I could just get over myself.\nMy parents did not say anything, but that it was my decision and they wouldbt interfere as im 21 years old and can decide for myself. \nB said im an asshole, because I woulsnt have to go much out of my way to make christmas eve more enjoyable for everybody else. \n\nWIBTA if I dont babysit this child?", "created_utc": 1671124605, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zmqi6g/wibta_if_i_dont_babysit_a_child_on_christmas/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If she wants her kid there and not to ruin the meal, maybe she should act like the kids mother and discipline it. Not your child, not your problem. I would stand my ground and say \"I'm sorry you feel it's selfish of me, but I feel it's selfish of you to try and hand off your responsibility to me so you can have a good evening. Either don't bring your kid, or watch them yourselves. But they aren't my problem.\" And leave it at that. It doesn't make you a bad person to not want to babysit.

It's not your kid and they're thinking it's a quick and free way to keep the child from annoying them so they can celebrate (without considering you, by the way). They're not even married and you have no obligation to do so.", "NTA. You are not there for the convenience of a stranger. This is your Christmas Eve and it is incredibly rude of her to dictate to you what you will do in your home.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019ve learned to ignore awful children.

YOU ARENT EVEN RELATED\n\nside note how do I quote lines in OPs post", "NTA you do not owe them your time or energy. It is not selfish to decline. If the kid ruins the holiday that's not on you, it's 100% on the mom and the brat kid.", "NTA\n\nIts not selfish of you, its selfish of her for being such a bad parent.

But the fact that they didn't ask and assumed immediately that you would do it???  Like wtf.  If you give in and do it, I can guarantee that you will become the defacto unpaid babysitter/nanny.  Do NOT give in and keep your boundaries strong.  Sure if you want to help out, do.  Id just make sure you are clear on the 5 w's and let them know that if they dump the kid on you without consent the kid goes to cps.", "Not at all WYBTA - She totally was for assuming she could just order you to do this the first time you met the kid.  This is her child, she can take care of him.  I hate it when people assume they have the right to drop their offspring on others and make them do all the work so they can enjoy whatever is going on.  Expecting you to give up having fun at the familiy gathering to deal with her spoiled child is total AH on the part of both B and GF.", "NTA.\n\nNot your kid or responsibility", "NTA in any way. If the kid gravitates towards you at the party, then personally I wouldn\u2019t mind. But in no way shape or form is he your responsibility to care for and control.

She needs to watch him.", "So it's okay for your christmas to be sacrificed for someone else's kid? NTA and I would repeat that it's selfish of them to expect that of you when it's your holiday as well. That you played with the kid to be nice at that moment, but they are not your responsibility and its crappy of them to dump that on you.", "NTA. What you're describing is very normal toddler behavior, but this child is solely the parents' responsibility to care for. The only way the child will 'ruin' everyone else's Christmas is if the mom doesn't parent.", "What the actual fuck??? Who invited this woman?? I\u2019m speechless and have no words. NTA at all, under no circumstances.", "NTA - did she just call you selfish for not wanting to babysit her kid during a family holiday event that ISNT EVEN HER FAMILY???\n\nTell her that you did not give birth to the child, she did. So it is her responsibility to calm and soothe the child, or to find childcare so that she can attend the event without him. Those are her options.\n\nIf she has trouble deciding, the third option is her staying home because she is both acting entitled and raising a brat, and no one at the family party should have to deal with either of them.", "NTA.   I would get a hotel room close by in the event things go south and you need a bit of time for a break from the drama.", "NTA the audacity of these people!  You don't know her or the kid that well, if he's such a problem, THEY should stay home.  You want to enjoy the holiday with your family, and that outweighs your brother's godfather's girlfriend, LOL.", "NTA\n If you do it once they will expect you to do it every time. So either she can watch her own kid or she can not go. I understand that you say she's a lovely woman and some kids are problem kids and it has nothing to do with parenting he could be on the spectrum or have another issue however she needs to step up and do something about it she needs to be a parent. If he is on the spectrum there are methods they use to help children socialize appropriately. Doesn't really matter either way not your responsibility.", "NTA not your child not your responsibility", "Hes a problem child, looses his cool easily and... Is just kind of a crybaby. Watching a lil bit over a child usually isnt a problem but I do not feel like it is MY job to watch hee child, even if it would make things easier and nicer for everybody.", "Only met once so far! This was on first meeting!", "NTA, and it's not selfish, but I disagree with saying the godfather is not even family. May not be biologically related, but whether he's family is up to the family.", "Yeah ofc, I absolutely normally dont mind watching a child. I just feel like its not my job to babysit someones child on christmas eve, even tho the child will be there anyway. I wouldnt have mind if they asked me if I could maybe play a little bit with P after dinner or so, cause I wouldve dine that.. i just dont feel like carrying that child with me all evening", "Um... B kind of invited her in.. he was like: ooh this is my gf.. yeahhh she might wanna spend christmas with me. My parents were a lil bit surprised but they usually never say no to a guest.. I kinda wish she wouldnt come cause I dont really want her there but.. it is what it is", "AGain, Why can't MOM watch him???", "He is like that because his mom does NOT parent him. She gives in, which is what she wants you to do. \n\nDon't do this, you will never be free again lol.", "Is he that problematic? It seems as soon as he got a bit of kindness and attention, every problem was solved... Not like you did anything magical there.\n\nDo his parents hug him? Allow him to sit in their lap like you did? Play and talk to him?", "Agreed. Offering to play with the child a bit during the day is one thing, being TOLD you will babysit them all day when you should be enjoying the holidays with family is unreasonable and entitled.", "He's TWO. It's completely normal for a two year old to cry when upset. Some kids are just more volatile. I have two kids, my first one was basically never upset, never put anything in their mouth, barely had to childproof anything. My second one is basically always upset, mouths anything they can find, gets into everything. I didn't suddenly stop parenting, they just have different personalities and temperaments.", "She is a lovely mother-from what I saw. Problem is , every time she says no, like : No P, please do not hit the couch table with ur toy. He starts crying cause hes not allowed to so it.", "Exactly. When my kid was that age, she had a weeping meltdown because it had been snowing and the snow stopped. \"Daddy please bring the snowflakes back!\"", "yeah and she might be a lovely person but- assuming no other issues with the kid- the behavior you are talking about, while a little of just being 2 (kids at that age are figuring out their boundaries so this behavior isn't abnormal)- is likely being exacerbated by the fact that the kid has figured out that mom is will eventually say yes.\n\nthat's why people talk a lot about consistency. if the answer is no- the answer has to still be no after the tantrum and the crying and the whatever.\n\nthough ideally mom would be stepping in and engaging in some redirecting- she shouldn't be going out with a 2 yr old without a bag of activities."]}
