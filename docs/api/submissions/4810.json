Or monster. Call it as u prefer. It was absolutely awful. P was crying and yelling every damn time he wasnt allowed to do smth, he threw tantrums, threw himself to the floor. At some point she took him outside. I sighed and said: Oh poor boy... Must have a bad day today hm? To B. And he said: No.. thats his normal self. My parents and me then laughed it a little bit of. \n\nNot much later,P and Bs gf came in again and at some point i tried playing with P, which went surprisingly well and he cried only little times, if i just did what he wanted. He also sat quietly at the table as long as he was on my lap. \nLater at the table, Bs gf then said, that P almost never behaves this well and that shes excited to join us on christmas as I can take care of P so the evening will run smoothly. \n\nI told her, in no way am I gonna play babysitter for her child.

It was quite presumptuous of her to just expect you to mind her child on Christmas Eve. You will be busy entertaining your boyfriend and visiting family.

Could she not, IDK, parent her child?  \nOP is NTA", "He sat quietly in your lap. He\u2019s pretty young, but has he been tested?", "Because Mom wants to party and get drunk without having to parent her child.", "NTA\n\nTell her it is completely selfish of her, a guest to your family Christmas to expect other people to babysit her child.\n\nCould you go to your boyfriends home for Christmas? Because I would be telling your parents under no circumstances would you be babysitting  that child and if your parents were not going to support you in this then you would prefer to spend x-mas eve with boyfriend family (this is nuclear option, so mention that you want parents support about the babysitting, before saying that you will spend it with BF).\n\nObviously if you want to go to the party and your parents won't support you re-babysitting, you will either have to fight all night with the gf, or suck it up and babysit.", "NTA not yo child, not yo problem", "NTA.

Tell her to stay home with kid at this point lol", "My parents did not side with her, they just told her that it was my decision wether I would babysit him or not. She tried talking to my parents as I still live with them, but they said that they wouldnt force anything on me like that.

Probably my parents too, if it gets too much.", "I dont think its about parenting her child. She is a nice woman, but her child just is a crybaby.

When we talked, I explained that my boyfriend has 4 nieces and nephews the same age, and that I usually also play with them. I think she then thought, that now that I made this statement, i volunteered for her to be a babysitter because, yknow, I also play with my bfs nieces. Difference is, SIL doesnt see me as a babysitter and still parents the children when they do smth bad. I just play with them, yet Im not their babysitter. It absolutely didnt ait right the way she said, I should get over myself. My thought is, that she maybe thinks I said no because I dont know her child that good yet.", "I thought about it and then realized, that I might said smth that made her think I volunteered.
