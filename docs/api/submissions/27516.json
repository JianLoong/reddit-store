Only met them once pre-pandemic since we live so far apart. They're lovely and I like them, but they're also chronic hoarders. My husband only arranged to stay with them for a night previously because his house was falling apart.\n\nFor our visit, they have tried their best to prepare a room for us in another property they own. I know they worked very hard on it considering they've had a lot going on in their lives. But when we arrived, there was no door to the bedroom only a cardboard door. There was no drywall so piping and wiring was exposed. They tacked cardboard in lieu of drywall so very little was exposed after that. The bathroom wasn't done so someone came in to finish the sink the next day and the place smelled of chemicals for a bit. The bathroom wasn't finished but usable. The living room and kitchen was completely unfinished and full of tools and building items and old things. The front door could be easily entered with a credit card because it was mostly broken.\n\nI was disturbed but we stayed for a couple of nights and I had to make sure my 1 year old didn't attempt to crawl out of the room. It got exhausting because I just had to keep a constant eye on her. My nose was itchy but in all fairness, the bed was comfortable and clean. There was A/C to keep things comfortable.\n\nThen the roaches came and by then I got fed up and said this is just unhygienic and unhealthy, especially since we have a baby. We looked for other accommodation and my in laws were shocked and upset. I get that they've put in a lot of effort and they think I'm a city girl used to better comfort and can't rough it out. I don't know...I just don't think it's a great place to house anybody...\n\nI suggested to stay in a hotel because I really wanted my husband to spend more time with his family and I felt that if we stayed in a more comfortable place then we can stay longer. If we had put up with it without saying anything, we would have just stayed one more night and left. I just feel bad and I can sense they think I'm very rude.

Any excuse would have been sufficient. And your husband should have shouldered the blame, not you. They're his parents.", "Just a question...how did the roaches show up in an unfinished house???   They usually follow some sort of food.  NTA to want to keep the family safe and find better accommodations...especially with a kid!!", "NAH. You have a 1-year old child. At that age, they\u2019re into EVERYTHING. The accommodation doesn\u2019t sound even slightly child-safe. \n\nYour script is, \u201cThank you for the work you did to ready the place. We appreciate it quite a lot. That said, Little Precious is at an awkward age, and we\u2019re concerned that she will grab something she shouldn\u2019t and be injured. If we stay in a hotel, Hubs can still see you and Precious can be safe.\u201d\n\nThen stand your ground. You\u2019re not being rude by choosing an environment for a toddler that does not have tools lying around.", "NTA. You and your family's health and safety takes priority over their feelings. If it were just a little messy or even if there was a little bit of a reno going on, I'd say grin and bear it for your husband, but this is absurd.", "This is appalling and completely unfit for a baby. I'm surprised you lasted a night. Sometimes you just have to let people think you're rude. NTA", "NTA - You had already gone above and beyond by even attempting to stay there instead of immediately going to a hotel.", "NTA.  Whew, you tolerated it longer than I would have.  It's okay if they can't accommodate you, but to put you in something substandard, especially with an infant who is mobile, is not reasonable.  Sorry if they can't see that and I wouldn't worry about it.  People who think like this probably do think you are rude or uppity, but so be it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they're upset about that, theres nothing you can do, but you shouldnt feel bad", "NTA. Bare minimum, hosts should have a safe (with a door that locks) finished room that is pest free and has a working bathroom. I\u2019d even stay somewhere for a night that fulfilled that and didn\u2019t have a bed. I\u2019d get a new place the next day to have a bed, but safe and healthy come first. Adding a child into the mix, and then you\u2019ll need a safe, healthy, & restful place so you can actually enjoy some sleep and continue caring for the small human being that\u2019s entirely reliant on you to keep alive. Do not feel bad for ensuring your well-being and your child\u2019s safety in this situation. \n\nI\u2019ve been the host a few time with my husband in our new house and I can\u2019t describe how bad that setup for a night\u2019s stay sounds. We both put in a lot of work for our guest room as well, however we don\u2019t have pest problems, our walls are installed and our bathrooms work. We had had a guest plan to stay over for a few days and then cancel and get a hotel room when we had just a pretty good air mattress. That absolutely hurt my feelings, however it caused us to prioritize buying and building a queen bed and frame. If it happens again, I\u2019ll be more mad than hurt, but again, people reject much more comfortable arrangements from their family than what you put up with.", "It's a really dusty and dirty house - been unfinished for years and they did tack old cardboards all over the walls and roaches like cardboard. So when we moved in and did have food wrappers and such, I guess they came. We threw out the trash daily and I had put an empty cereal bowl I just finished on the table and put my baby to sleep and came back to see a giant roach in it. And saw a few more roaming around when I went to the bathroom to pee after feeding baby in the middle of the night.", "Yea I guess I can see that after seeing all the comments. I just feel bad cos they're not just anyone but my family so I'm sad obviously that they would think I'm rude and uppity. I also have social anxiety so this definitely doesn't help me feel confident in trying to bond with them despite our differences. But I also get that they're chronic hoarders and don't have the same standard of living as I would, so maybe we'll never get each other that way."]}
