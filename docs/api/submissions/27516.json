My husband only arranged to stay with them for a night previously because his house was falling apart.\n\nFor our visit, they have tried their best to prepare a room for us in another property they own. I know they worked very hard on it considering they've had a lot going on in their lives. But when we arrived, there was no door to the bedroom only a cardboard door. There was no drywall so piping and wiring was exposed. They tacked cardboard in lieu of drywall so very little was exposed after that. The bathroom wasn't done so someone came in to finish the sink the next day and the place smelled of chemicals for a bit. The bathroom wasn't finished but usable. The living room and kitchen was completely unfinished and full of tools and building items and old things.

It got exhausting because I just had to keep a constant eye on her. My nose was itchy but in all fairness, the bed was comfortable and clean. There was A/C to keep things comfortable.\n\nThen the roaches came and by then I got fed up and said this is just unhygienic and unhealthy, especially since we have a baby. We looked for other accommodation and my in laws were shocked and upset. I get that they've put in a lot of effort and they think I'm a city girl used to better comfort and can't rough it out. I don't know...I just don't think it's a great place to house anybody...\n\nI suggested to stay in a hotel because I really wanted my husband to spend more time with his family and I felt that if we stayed in a more comfortable place then we can stay longer. If we had put up with it without saying anything, we would have just stayed one more night and left. I just feel bad and I can sense they think I'm very rude.

They usually follow some sort of food.  NTA to want to keep the family safe and find better accommodations...especially with a kid!!", "NAH. You have a 1-year old child. At that age, they\u2019re into EVERYTHING. The accommodation doesn\u2019t sound even slightly child-safe. \n\nYour script is, \u201cThank you for the work you did to ready the place. We appreciate it quite a lot. That said, Little Precious is at an awkward age, and we\u2019re concerned that she will grab something she shouldn\u2019t and be injured. If we stay in a hotel, Hubs can still see you and Precious can be safe.\u201d\n\nThen stand your ground. You\u2019re not being rude by choosing an environment for a toddler that does not have tools lying around.", "NTA. You and your family's health and safety takes priority over their feelings. If it were just a little messy or even if there was a little bit of a reno going on, I'd say grin and bear it for your husband, but this is absurd.", "This is appalling and completely unfit for a baby. I'm surprised you lasted a night. Sometimes you just have to let people think you're rude. NTA", "NTA - You had already gone above and beyond by even attempting to stay there instead of immediately going to a hotel.", "NTA.  Whew, you tolerated it longer than I would have.  It's okay if they can't accommodate you, but to put you in something substandard, especially with an infant who is mobile, is not reasonable.  Sorry if they can't see that and I wouldn't worry about it.  People who think like this probably do think you are rude or uppity, but so be it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If they're upset about that, theres nothing you can do, but you shouldnt feel bad", "NTA. Bare minimum, hosts should have a safe (with a door that locks) finished room that is pest free and has a working bathroom. I\u2019d even stay somewhere for a night that fulfilled that and didn\u2019t have a bed. I\u2019d get a new place the next day to have a bed, but safe and healthy come first. Adding a child into the mix, and then you\u2019ll need a safe, healthy, & restful place so you can actually enjoy some sleep and continue caring for the small human being that\u2019s entirely reliant on you to keep alive. Do not feel bad for ensuring your well-being and your child\u2019s safety in this situation. \n\nI\u2019ve been the host a few time with my husband in our new house and I can\u2019t describe how bad that setup for a night\u2019s stay sounds. We both put in a lot of work for our guest room as well, however we don\u2019t have pest problems, our walls are installed and our bathrooms work. We had had a guest plan to stay over for a few days and then cancel and get a hotel room when we had just a pretty good air mattress. That absolutely hurt my feelings, however it caused us to prioritize buying and building a queen bed and frame. If it happens again, I\u2019ll be more mad than hurt, but again, people reject much more comfortable arrangements from their family than what you put up with.", "It's a really dusty and dirty house - been unfinished for years and they did tack old cardboards all over the walls and roaches like cardboard. So when we moved in and did have food wrappers and such, I guess they came. We threw out the trash daily and I had put an empty cereal bowl I just finished on the table and put my baby to sleep and came back to see a giant roach in it. And saw a few more roaming around when I went to the bathroom to pee after feeding baby in the middle of the night.", "Yea I guess I can see that after seeing all the comments. I just feel bad cos they're not just anyone but my family so I'm sad obviously that they would think I'm rude and uppity. I also have social anxiety so this definitely doesn't help me feel confident in trying to bond with them despite our differences. But I also get that they're chronic hoarders and don't have the same standard of living as I would, so maybe we'll never get each other that way.", "Realistically speaking, your in-laws might have put in a lot of work, but they housed you in accommodation that was dangerous to your child, unpleasant, filled with roaches, and unhygienic.   The in-laws being shocked and upset would seem to be an indication of their being out of touch with reality.\n\nYou didn't reject the housing they offered because you're a coddled woman who demands the lap of luxury.  But you have every right to stay in a place that is safe and healthy and fully constructed.  I'm sorry they're shocked and blaming you, but nevertheless, always arrange your own accommodation when you visit.\n\nNTA", "NTA I wouldn\u2019t have even let a single one of our items or my baby enter that house. It\u2019s actually rude and absolutely disgusting to expect family ESPECIALLY a baby to stay in a unsafe, unsanitary & unhealthy environment let alone get angry about it.", "COCKROACHES. **COCKROACHES.**\n\nYou and your husband are being too kind. \"I don't thinking either of you realise how out of hand your hoarding problem is. We won't be bringing our child into an environment with roaches. If you want us to help, we're a phonecall away. But we will be staying in hotels when we visit you until such a time there are no infestations that might give our child serious illness.\"\n\nNTA", "NTA I wont stay anywhere once I see a cockroach.", "NTA I would have been out of there in 5 minutes to protect the kid, between the bugs and the fire hazards I am shocked you managed so long!", "Very very NTA. Who in their right mind thinks putting someone up in an unfinished, unsafe, roach-infested property is good hosting?? Putting aside that they wanted you to stay, their provided accomodations were enough to make all of you sick or get you injured. Their hoarding behavior has desensitized them to what a normal house should look like. \n\nA roach should not be immediately upon an empty bowl you set down. \n\nDoors and walls should not be made out of cardboard unless you're 5 and in a playhouse made from an old washing machine box.\n\nDo not feel bad about wanting different accomodations to stay because the place they put you is a deathtrap for your kid. If the exposed wires(?????!!!!!) don't get them, inhaling roach droppings will give them respiratory issues. Definitely get a hotel gum now on.", "Nta", "NTA. Their sense of what is normal and acceptable has been slowly creeping away from reality for so long that they really don't see what you see. It's ok if they feel upset; that's not something you can help, and worrying about it will only make it worse. For future trips, make it clear from the start you will be staying in a hotel. It's not even a discussion. Move right in to planning how you will spend time together.", "NTA to me but I can understand the dilemma you must be in.\n\nAs a kid, whenever we visited my mom\u2019s family in another country they would make me stay at their unfinished building. I know they put in a lot of effort to make me \u201cthe city girl\u201d comfortable and they also took a lot of pride in slowly finishing up that building. BUT damn I hated it and anything I said other than thank you and accepting as is was seen as rude. There was not hot water is I showered in cold water in winter. It was just not a vaccination and I tried every way to get out of these trips but was scolded for being ashamed of family. Erm no\n\nAnyway it continued into adulthood, building still not finished. Now I just don\u2019t visit and accept whatever people say of me\n\nMy long story is basically to say that they likely will never understand. You will always been seen as the fussy city girl. Just do what\u2019s best for you and your family. Because unless you accept 100% of the conditions, it\u2019s likely never going to be enough", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStay in the hotel.", "I maybe would have toughed it out on my own, but with a baby, no chance.  I don\u2019t think anybody should be expected to stay with a baby in those conditions, unless forced - it\u2019s just not safe, hygienic, or healthy. And that has nothing to do with being fussy.  It\u2019s pretty terrible that they think these circumstances are safe for their grandchild.\n\nAnd I say all of this as somebody who grew up in the States but visited my  very middle class family in India (city and village).  My tolerance for toughing it out is actually greater than that of my mother, who grew up in less comfortable circumstances. She would have taken one look at that place and turned around. So, it\u2019s not just \u201cfussy city girls\u201d."]}
