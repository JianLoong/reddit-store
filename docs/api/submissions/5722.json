While I was freaking and calling an ambulance because I was terrified  about a potential spinal injury  (thank god she only got a concussion).  I told what happened to Anna and to look after her sister (my son was on a school trip). She told me she have to go to work in few hours. I told her in not the best tone to \"figure shit out\" (she called her grandmothers for help ) than left with the ambulance.\n\nAbout 5 day latter when everything calmed down and my wife was let home form the hospital. Anna sat me down to talk. She said that she thinks that I am parentifying her because how \"much\" she have to take care of her younger siblings.\n\nFirst I asked her define what her meant. So here is an itemized list about her responsibilities in my house: 1. She have to cook a meal every week. Btw she is a professional chef. It's started when she was 14 and wanted to try out things what she saw in cooking shows.\n\n2. Keep your room and general stuff clean.\n\n3.Transfer her sibling to and from school IF it align  with your school/work schedule.\n\nEdit1: She bring them home if she finishes  around pick up time max 1-2 a week.\n\n4. Be part of the bedtime story rotation. All of my kids where very picky about who reads them and every night it had to be someone else.\n\n5. Babysitting her sibling when she have time or it's necessary. To be clear my son also do this with her sister.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I started laughing because I found her claims quite ridiculous. Maybe I am a delusional old fart but I don't think I ask too much from her.\n\nThan I told her lets think about it as a business deal that what I get from this deal. Let's see what you get out from  this : 1. You live here rent free.\n\n2. I gave you a car for your 18th birthday and I still pay the insurance on it.\n\n3. I don't know how much money I spent on your passion. Half of our (quite big for our country's standards) kitchen is your stuff. Much of it is professional grade.\n\nI told her I appreciate her and what she does for the family but If she fell other wise maybe it's time  for her to move out. I offered her that I will pay for the first 3 months of rent if she really would like to move out.\n\nI think I am fair but I need some outside perspective.

Cooking one meal a week in the house she lives in, giving her siblings a ride a couple of times a week in a free car she doesn't pay insurance for, and reading a bedtime story every few days, and she doesn't pay rent? I would have killed for that deal when I was 13. Or 18. \n\nIt's very reasonable to say \"if you don't like it, you're an adult, go take care of yourself\".

My mom didn't even poke her head into our room to check on us when she woke up. When I woke up. I checked on her in her crib, and her eyes were swollen shut.

Based on your comments about how much \u201cparental work\u201d is required of her and the severity of the situation, as well as your own introspection\u2014The terms that you gave when she expressed her concerns seem very fair. she will find a different and possibly much heavier work load living on her own. It seems that you have given her a very good launch pad, and if this is the point that makes her want to move out, that\u2019s okay. I would recommend having a good talk about the history of her parentification, and the realities of living on your own as to not tarnish your relationship.", "There\u2019s a difference between being an active member of a family and parentified.

Maybe she'll be happier, maybe she'll realize how easy she had it, but it may be useful overall. She wants to be your responsibility to house and feed without any responsibility to the household. I think we'd all like that, but that's not how being an adult works.  \n\nSeparately, you have an issue that your daughter made an emergency issue all about her. At least your description shows no empathy. It's a bit concerning, and at the very least you should make sure the younger siblings don't pick up the wrong lessons from the big sister.", "NTA - her mother had an accident and she was more concerned about going to work? In an emergency situation I would expect my children to help out without hesitation.  She lives in the house rent free, a lot of additional benefits such as the car, so it\u2019s only fair that she pulls her weight. Parentification is bandied about so much now for kids doing chores etc and helping out with their siblings, that it trivialises the true meaning of the word, and minimises the realities that children who actually suffer parentification face!!", "NTA - my friend who was forced to raise her 3 siblings starting from age 10 due to a coked/ methed out mom  who eventually OD\u2019d when she was 16 and then had to legally adopt her siblings and drop out of school would like to sit down with your adult daughter, living at home, not paying rent and occasionally helping out with sibling responsibilities and compare life stories. Your daughter is a snob and you SHOULD kick her to the curb to learn what the real world is actually like.", "Info: how old was your daughter when she was added to the bedtime story rotation? You have a 4 year old, but you also wrote that your children are picky about who reads to them, which suggests that she was also put in charge of reading to the now 13 year old when he was the appropriate age for someone to read bedtime stories to him too. If you were forcing your daughter to deal with her brother's bed time when she was 11 and he was 2 then that seems inappropriate.", "NTA - It was an emergency situation and everyone needed to act fast. She is an adult and perfectly capable of \u201cfiguring it out\u201d and she did.\n\nPart of being in a family is helping to contribute to the family monetarily or with labor. \n\nCooking a meal every week is perfectly reasonable if she is eating at home during other days of the week. Which I am sure she is. Why does she expect others to make food for her and not have to reciprocate?\n\nKeeping her stuff clean is a completely reasonable request.\n\nHelping to transport her siblings is completely reasonable since you bought her a car and pay her insurance. Win/win\n\nStop making her do the bed time rotation. That\u2019s weird. If she wants to continue, that\u2019s cute. But making her do it is just weird. Stop.\n\nBabysitting her siblings. . . I am on the fence. It really depends how much you are asking her to do this. If she is babysitting your youngest more than you are with them\u2026yikes. You need to sit down and ask yourself if you are taking advantage of her as a third parent. Only you will truly know the answer to this. The fact that you make your 13 years old babysit too makes me think you might be relying on them too much. I am strongly against having other minor children babysit others. But your daughter is an adult and she should be contributing like an adult. If you want babysitting as part of the stipulation for living with you\u2026that is your right. But again, she should not be spending more time with your children then you do. Limit it to twice or three times a month.\n\n\nEdit: NTA since OP stated she babysits only 20-40 hours a year.", "May not be popular, but I\u2019d lightly say ESH.  You were totally fine to ask for help in the moment your wife was injured.  But there are bigger issues at play here.  \n\nIt sounds like a lot of this comes down to lack of clearly expressed expectations and understandings.  She plainly benefits from you, even now as an adult.  You plainly expect her to contribute to the care of the home and younger siblings.  I suspect a lot of this could be cleared by a more clearly delineated \u201cthis is what we can offer/you can have, and in exchange we expect/would appreciate X.\u201d", "Helping out in an emergency is fine. You were very rude telling her to figure shit out, though. She had to work! The rest does read like parentification. She shouldn\u2019t need to put your kids to bed or take them to and from school. That\u2019s YOUR job. And how often is it \u201cnecessary\u201d that she babysits? Sounds like you are relying on her too much to be a third parent. She is your child and you are looking at her like a \u201cbusiness deal\u201d and wondering what you get out of her presence.", "Honestly right now, given how vague you've been in several places, I'm going with YTA. You're actively holding every gift you've ever given your daughter over her head as a strings attached duty. \n\nCombined with the hostile way you went against her, aiming to immediately browbeat her into submission rather than initially trying to assuage her with a conversation about expectations, I have a hard time trusting your word on how much you actually are forcing onto her and your claim that this is at the level of a fair trade and has always been so since her childhood.\n\nIt sounds like you're pressuring her too much and risking her education while claiming to be supporting it, and you really should ask yourself why you want your daughter to believe she never can trust a single gift you gave her to be an actual gift.", "NTA, that's just standard you live at home you help around the house. It's not even much if we're being completely honest. Most houses she would be in in the cleaning/vacuum help with homework etc.", "NTA. You aren't parentifying her, you are asking her to contribute to care and upkeep of the household as an adult who lives there rent free.\n\nWhat you have asked is more than reasonable.", "You are not TA for needing her to babysit, but most definitely YTA for your attitude more generally. \n\n1. You were super rude to her when she expressed that she needed to work. I would have let that go if that were the only instance since it was an emergency, but\n2. You laughed in her face when she tried to discuss issues with you. \n3. Given the wording of the list, I have serious doubts those are actually her words. It seems like you are minimizing them to make them sound as silly and small as possible. It's not a fair or balanced take.\n\nIt really feels like there are some missing missing reasons here and you are doing everything to minimize or dismiss her concerns rather than listening to them.", "I personally feel like yta. I\u2019m so glad I brought my own car, paid for college tuition, and insurance with the barley paying jobs I had. I do get doing house chores and cooking but being a babysitter that\u2019s were I draw the line. How tell you your daughter to figure it out when you your wife falls. If she lost her job that would\u2019ve been another issue. Jobs don\u2019t care about no family emergency, they\u2019re always looking to replace a person.

Here's why, your child comes to you with a problem. Your reaction is to dismiss it, laugh at her, and tell her her only other option is to leave. That's an AH.\n\nThis is not a business transaction, this is your daughter! She has her reasons. She's working and going to school? That's what she should be doing right now. And those two things take a lot of time and energy. Find out where the conflicts are.\n\nMy recommendation is to sit down, apologize and discuss this with her. Find out why she feels this way and perhaps you two can reach an agreement that doesn't involve kicking her out. Perhaps it is time to leave. Whatever the outcome, she deserves to be heard - not laughed at.", "YTA.\nIf you want her to contribute to your family, maybe you need to have a discussion with her about it rather than just demanding things that don't work for her.  If she is living rent-free and you are paying her car, etc, then make a deal with her what you want in return.  Then she can take it or leave it. Or maybe compromise so it works for everyone. She is now an adult and shouldn't be dictated to. Expecting her to read a bedtime story when you are in the house is unreasonable. Dumping her with your kid when she needs to go to work is unreasonable. Making it her problem to organise childcare is lazy.", "NTA", "YTA because she approached you like an adult to have a discussion about her concerns. \n\nWe\u2019re not talking about whether those concerns are valid or not, that\u2019s beyond Reddit\u2019s pay grade.\n\nBut laughing at her trying to have a reasonable discussion, and then throwing how much money you\u2019ve spent into her face, that makes you a huge asshole.", "The way you said it to her. Yta\n\n\"Figure shit out\" with your kids is your job, not hers. She told you she was going to get job. Being on bedtime story rotation is your job as a parent, not hers. Moving your child to and from school, your job, not hers. \n\nParentification is when a parent acts like raising a child is also another one their child's responsibilities, which it sounds like you are doing. \n\nSo here's some advice I recently read, \"figure shit out. \"", "I'd say YTA for two reasons.\n\n1) Anna actually tries to talk to you about it, but instead of acknowledging her feelings and discussing it with her, you laugh at her. That's incredibly disrespectful when someone comes to you with a problem of this kind.\n\n2) From how you've described it, it seems that you think that since you spent money on her, she owes you. That's not how it works, especially not with family.\n\nI hope you guys have a good talk about it instead.", "YTA.\n\n* If you want childcare then pay for it. Don't use Anna as a slave. That's disgusting.\n* You tried to jeopardize Anna's career by leaving your other kids with her when you knew she had to work. She should have called CPS on you for abandoning your children. Fortunately her grandparents were able to take over. You should have called them yourself instead of dumping everything on Anna.\n* She shouldn't have to cook meals at home if she doesn't want to. Even if it's one a week. She's a professional chef? You really think she wants to have to come home and cook again after cooking all day? Get off your ass and cook meals for your family.\n* They're **your** kids. **You** should look after them.\n* Similarly, take responsibility and take your kids to school and read bedtime stories to them.\n   * \u00c1ron is 13. Why are you still reading bedtime stories to him?\n* If the kids want a different storyteller every night, then you and your wife should take turns. It's an obvious solution. I don't know why it didn't occur to you.\n* If you can't be around to watch your kids, then **pay** for childcare. Stop using Anna as free labor and \u00c1ron as free **child labor**.\n   * You're *definitely* parentifying \u00c1ron. He's still a child.\n* You laughed at Anna. You refuse to engage with her as an adult and take her seriously, yet you force adult responsibilities on her. **Pick one.**\n* Oh, but you give Anna a roof over her head? How touching. That's part of what being a parent entails. Stop complaining.\n* Same thing with her car. What, do you think it would have been acceptable to leave her stuck at home unable to travel independently?\n* You're not actually bothered about the cost of those things. You just want to hold them over her head in order to control her.\n* You don't know how much money you spent on her passion? That sounds like a **you** problem. Track your money better instead of blaming Anna for your failings.\n* You want her gone? Buy her a house or at the very least pay a rental deposit and twelve months of rent for her. Don't leave her on the hook for nine months so that you can force her into doing your bidding again in three months. That's despicable.\n* My outside perspective is that you are not fair. You chose to have kids, now take responsibility for that choice and look after your kids instead of forcing them to do your job for you.", "Lmao NTA you are doing more than enough and she is delusional if she thinks life will be better on her own.", "NTA\n\nMaking her part of the story-time is a little AHish if she doesn't want to do it\n\nEverything else seems reasonable.

I get that you had an emergency, but you made that demand to your daughter in a really inconsiderate and nasty way and spoke down to her when she tried to tell you she couldn't do that on such short notice.\n\nIf you'd like her to move out, you can go that extreme route if you want to I suppose, but it might be worth just actually writing up some kind of contract WITH HER INPUT on what is reasonable money/labor trade for her to be living there so you BOTH have the security of knowing what to expect and you'll both have agreed to the terms instead of you just handing them down.", "YTA.", "YTA\n\nWill this isn't some hard-core parentifying it still is a little bit, on points 4 and 5 of her house duties. I assume that if she felt it was enough to sit down and talk, that there's probably more to the story you're not telling. Regardless, it really does sound like you're offloading parental duties on yo your older children. You pretty much admit it in the second half of your post, that those are obligations you expect of her seeing as she doesn't pay rent.\n\nBy the way, it's even more concerning that you're doing it to your younger son too. Remember that parentifying can have awful psychological consequences on the child, and can be considered a form of abuse.

Ill be honest, as someone who was parentified as a teen and early-adulthood this could go either way for me. I had 12 younger siblings i had to wake up, feed breakfast and get on busses/take to school (depending on the kid), make sure they took lunches. Then I head to pick up from school, do homework and delegate chores, cook dinner, signs forms, organize bedtime (read stories, check that people were in bed at the correct time, etc). I got $100/week from my parents to do this. In their minds, I \"only\" had to watch the kids a bit. I could still go to school! I was allowed to hang out with friends! They gave me a car to drive!

I'd stay up til 3am to get my homework done because I had to do my stuff after working on the kid's stuff.

I couldn't see friends unless they came to our house because my parents wouldn't watch the kids and I couldn't afford a baby sitter for the many kids, most who had special needs, on $100/week (of which I paid my own gas doing their errands and their lunch money/small expenses - field trip money came from me. New clothes my parents paid for, but I had to take them to buy).

This is further supported by OP pointing out that he/his wife bought her a bunch of expensive, professional grade cooking equipment.\n\nRegardless, giving a child some household responsibilities is not parentification.  It's a normal way to teach them how to be an adult.  If one of those chores is to cook a meal once a week, that's fine.\n\nYou could argue that OP could have communicated expectations more clearly (which it seems that he did after she brought up her issues), but none of this is parentification.

It's being part of a family.", "I'm going off what OP wrote, not making things up (to suit a narrative).  OP laughed because it's a ridiculous claim.  For one, a twenty-two year old, by definition, can't be parentified.  Her using that word is incredibly harmful because crying wolf like that makes it that much more difficult for legitimately parentified **children** to be taken seriously (when they claim it as a problem).  It is offensive (to anyone who has been through that issue) for a literal adult to claim parentification, especially when, even if we were talking about a teenager, none of these expectations would be abnormal.\n\nAccording to everything he posted, OP is a good father who's supported his child in every way he knows how.  Not only did he do so financially (well into adulthood) but also regarding her hobbies and interests.  Regardless of who owns that equipment (we don't know), it was clearly bought to support her hobby (that then became a career).  \n\nThat you would immediately jump to defend an adult who wants to act like a child (a 22 year-old claiming parentification while being entirely supported by her parents in a way that most people could only dream of) says way more about you than it does about this situation.  \n\nLike I said, it's (at worst) an issue of communication.  But it really sounds like (to me) an entitled person who's been shown nothing but support.  Then, when it comes time for her to pay that support forward, she balks and misuses internet buzzwords to guilt trip her parent (over a level of responsibility that is entirely normal for a teenager, much less an adult who's being completely supported by said parent).\n\nObviously, OP could by lying (or omitting facts), but this sub is about taking the information given, then making a judgment.

It sucks. They are unaware of the pain they cause and will never see it. So I understand you. Some people are really just that blind. We gave up years ago trying to get them to see. Everyone is pretty much no contact these days and we will always be their for my kid but even having us all never can take away the pain my sibling caused but they cry and play victim because their kid won't communicate with them anymore and cut them off after so many chances and hurts.", "Nice leap you made there.", "They are both adults.

Disagreeing is not attacking.  It just means I don't buy what you're selling.  \n\nNothing about my defense of OP is blind.  I've enumerated many reasons I think the way I do.  That is not \"blind\".  It's taking the facts presented and making a judgement.  There is no \"victim\" in this scenario (and I'm not basing my judgement on some unrelated person's anecdotal evidence of a completely different situation).  The bottom line is that a twenty-two year old is an adult, and as such, can not be parentified.  Therefore, the daughter's entire argument is ridiculous (because that's her claim).  You can disagree about the daughter's entitlement (which is completely subjective but, I feel, supported by the evidence at hand), but the daughter's claim of parentification is absolutely, objectively false (again, it is impossible for an adult to be parentified).  Which makes her entire argument (which was made in support of said claim) invalid.  As I said, ignoring that fact says a lot about where your head's at.  Not a personal attack.  Just an observation that could explain your perspective.", "You're the one that insisted no sum of duties can ever be suspected of being too much for someone both working and attending school since it's just a part of being a family."]}
