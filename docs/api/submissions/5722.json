(Sorry I am not a native speaker and these are obviously fake names)\n\nSo about two weeks ago my wife suffered an accident. She slipped on the frozen stairs. While I was freaking and calling an ambulance because I was terrified  about a potential spinal injury  (thank god she only got a concussion).  I told what happened to Anna and to look after her sister (my son was on a school trip). She told me she have to go to work in few hours. I told her in not the best tone to \"figure shit out\" (she called her grandmothers for help ) than left with the ambulance.\n\nAbout 5 day latter when everything calmed down and my wife was let home form the hospital. Anna sat me down to talk. She said that she thinks that I am parentifying her because how \"much\" she have to take care of her younger siblings.\n\nFirst I asked her define what her meant. So here is an itemized list about her responsibilities in my house: 1. She have to cook a meal every week. Btw she is a professional chef. It's started when she was 14 and wanted to try out things what she saw in cooking shows.\n\n2. Keep your room and general stuff clean.\n\n3.Transfer her sibling to and from school IF it align  with your work schedule.\n\nEdit1: She bring them home if she finishes  around pick up time max 1-2 a week.\n\n4. Be part of the bedtime story rotation. All of my kids where very picky about who reads them and every night it had to be someone else.\n\n5. Babysitting her sibling when she have time or it's necessary. To be clear my son also do this with her sister.\n\nEdit2: The necessary (what is 20-40 hours a year) part of it when both me and my wife are unexpectedly unavailable. But in cases like me and wife's 2 day romantic trip in October childcare is coordinated with multiple people mostly with my parents and in-laws. In normal day to day circumstances Csilla loves to spend time with her big sister, we need to limit her to about 1-1,5 hours a day  so Anna could have some free time.     \n\nSo I started laughing because I found her claims quite ridiculous. Maybe I am a delusional old fart but I don't think I ask too much from her.\n\nThan I told her lets think about it as a business deal that what I get from this deal. Let's see what you get out from  this : 1. You live here rent free.\n\n2. I gave you a car for your 18th birthday and I still pay the insurance on it.\n\n3. I don't know how much money I spent on your passion. Half of our (quite big for our country's standards) kitchen is your stuff. Much of it is professional grade.\n\nI told her I appreciate her and what she does for the family but If she fell other wise maybe it's time  for her to move out. I offered her that I will pay for the first 3 months of rent if she really would like to move out.\n\nI think I am fair but I need some outside perspective.

You didn\u2019t neglect your other kids so she parents them better than you in part or whole. She\u2019s not taking care of any aspect of their lives in a significant way that would burden her. But indeed if she feels it is a burden she has every right to move out, and you\u2019re generous father for giving her the cash to do so up front.\n\nETA: IMHO your daughter should be grateful you didn\u2019t take offence at her implying you\u2019re abusive.

Cooking one meal a week in the house she lives in, giving her siblings a ride a couple of times a week in a free car she doesn't pay insurance for, and reading a bedtime story every few days, and she doesn't pay rent? I would have killed for that deal when I was 13. Or 18. \n\nIt's very reasonable to say \"if you don't like it, you're an adult, go take care of yourself\".

My mom didn't even poke her head into our room to check on us when she woke up. When I woke up. I checked on her in her crib, and her eyes were swollen shut. I had to go find my mom to tell her that the baby was sick. That is parentifying a child. \n\nYour expectations are reasonable.

Based on your comments about how much \u201cparental work\u201d is required of her and the severity of the situation, as well as your own introspection\u2014The terms that you gave when she expressed her concerns seem very fair. she will find a different and possibly much heavier work load living on her own. It seems that you have given her a very good launch pad, and if this is the point that makes her want to move out, that\u2019s okay. I would recommend having a good talk about the history of her parentification, and the realities of living on your own as to not tarnish your relationship.", "There\u2019s a difference between being an active member of a family and parentified.

Maybe she'll be happier, maybe she'll realize how easy she had it, but it may be useful overall. She wants to be your responsibility to house and feed without any responsibility to the household. I think we'd all like that, but that's not how being an adult works.  \n\nSeparately, you have an issue that your daughter made an emergency issue all about her. At least your description shows no empathy.

In an emergency situation I would expect my children to help out without hesitation.  She lives in the house rent free, a lot of additional benefits such as the car, so it\u2019s only fair that she pulls her weight.

You have a 4 year old, but you also wrote that your children are picky about who reads to them, which suggests that she was also put in charge of reading to the now 13 year old when he was the appropriate age for someone to read bedtime stories to him too. If you were forcing your daughter to deal with her brother's bed time when she was 11 and he was 2 then that seems inappropriate.", "NTA - It was an emergency situation and everyone needed to act fast. She is an adult and perfectly capable of \u201cfiguring it out\u201d and she did.\n\nPart of being in a family is helping to contribute to the family monetarily or with labor. \n\nCooking a meal every week is perfectly reasonable if she is eating at home during other days of the week. Which I am sure she is. Why does she expect others to make food for her and not have to reciprocate?\n\nKeeping her stuff clean is a completely reasonable request.\n\nHelping to transport her siblings is completely reasonable since you bought her a car and pay her insurance. Win/win\n\nStop making her do the bed time rotation. That\u2019s weird. If she wants to continue, that\u2019s cute. But making her do it is just weird. Stop.\n\nBabysitting her siblings. . . I am on the fence. It really depends how much you are asking her to do this. If she is babysitting your youngest more than you are with them\u2026yikes. You need to sit down and ask yourself if you are taking advantage of her as a third parent. Only you will truly know the answer to this. The fact that you make your 13 years old babysit too makes me think you might be relying on them too much. I am strongly against having other minor children babysit others. But your daughter is an adult and she should be contributing like an adult. If you want babysitting as part of the stipulation for living with you\u2026that is your right. But again, she should not be spending more time with your children then you do. Limit it to twice or three times a month.\n\n\nEdit: NTA since OP stated she babysits only 20-40 hours a year.", "May not be popular, but I\u2019d lightly say ESH.  You were totally fine to ask for help in the moment your wife was injured.  But there are bigger issues at play here.  \n\nIt sounds like a lot of this comes down to lack of clearly expressed expectations and understandings.  She plainly benefits from you, even now as an adult.  You plainly expect her to contribute to the care of the home and younger siblings.  I suspect a lot of this could be cleared by a more clearly delineated \u201cthis is what we can offer/you can have, and in exchange we expect/would appreciate X.\u201d", "Helping out in an emergency is fine. You were very rude telling her to figure shit out, though. She had to work! The rest does read like parentification. She shouldn\u2019t need to put your kids to bed or take them to and from school. That\u2019s YOUR job. And how often is it \u201cnecessary\u201d that she babysits? Sounds like you are relying on her too much to be a third parent.

You're actively holding every gift you've ever given your daughter over her head as a strings attached duty. \n\nCombined with the hostile way you went against her, aiming to immediately browbeat her into submission rather than initially trying to assuage her with a conversation about expectations, I have a hard time trusting your word on how much you actually are forcing onto her and your claim that this is at the level of a fair trade and has always been so since her childhood.\n\nIt sounds like you're pressuring her too much and risking her education while claiming to be supporting it, and you really should ask yourself why you want your daughter to believe she never can trust a single gift you gave her to be an actual gift.", "NTA, that's just standard you live at home you help around the house. It's not even much if we're being completely honest. Most houses she would be in in the cleaning/vacuum help with homework etc.", "NTA.

You were super rude to her when she expressed that she needed to work. I would have let that go if that were the only instance since it was an emergency, but\n2. You laughed in her face when she tried to discuss issues with you. \n3. Given the wording of the list, I have serious doubts those are actually her words.

I\u2019m so glad I brought my own car, paid for college tuition, and insurance with the barley paying jobs I had. I do get doing house chores and cooking but being a babysitter that\u2019s were I draw the line. How tell you your daughter to figure it out when you your wife falls. If she lost her job that would\u2019ve been another issue. Jobs don\u2019t care about no family emergency, they\u2019re always looking to replace a person.

And those two things take a lot of time and energy. Find out where the conflicts are.\n\nMy recommendation is to sit down, apologize and discuss this with her. Find out why she feels this way and perhaps you two can reach an agreement that doesn't involve kicking her out. Perhaps it is time to leave.

If she is living rent-free and you are paying her car, etc, then make a deal with her what you want in return.  Then she can take it or leave it. Or maybe compromise so it works for everyone. She is now an adult and shouldn't be dictated to. Expecting her to read a bedtime story when you are in the house is unreasonable. Dumping her with your kid when she needs to go to work is unreasonable. Making it her problem to organise childcare is lazy.", "NTA", "YTA because she approached you like an adult to have a discussion about her concerns. \n\nWe\u2019re not talking about whether those concerns are valid or not, that\u2019s beyond Reddit\u2019s pay grade.\n\nBut laughing at her trying to have a reasonable discussion, and then throwing how much money you\u2019ve spent into her face, that makes you a huge asshole.", "The way you said it to her.

That's not how it works, especially not with family.\n\nI hope you guys have a good talk about it instead.", "YTA.\n\n* If you want childcare then pay for it. Don't use Anna as a slave. That's disgusting.\n* You tried to jeopardize Anna's career by leaving your other kids with her when you knew she had to work. She should have called CPS on you for abandoning your children. Fortunately her grandparents were able to take over. You should have called them yourself instead of dumping everything on Anna.\n* She shouldn't have to cook meals at home if she doesn't want to. Even if it's one a week. She's a professional chef? You really think she wants to have to come home and cook again after cooking all day? Get off your ass and cook meals for your family.\n* They're **your** kids. **You** should look after them.\n* Similarly, take responsibility and take your kids to school and read bedtime stories to them.\n   * \u00c1ron is 13. Why are you still reading bedtime stories to him?\n* If the kids want a different storyteller every night, then you and your wife should take turns. It's an obvious solution. I don't know why it didn't occur to you.\n* If you can't be around to watch your kids, then **pay** for childcare. Stop using Anna as free labor and \u00c1ron as free **child labor**.\n   * You're *definitely* parentifying \u00c1ron. He's still a child.\n* You laughed at Anna. You refuse to engage with her as an adult and take her seriously, yet you force adult responsibilities on her. **Pick one.**\n* Oh, but you give Anna a roof over her head? How touching. That's part of what being a parent entails. Stop complaining.\n* Same thing with her car. What, do you think it would have been acceptable to leave her stuck at home unable to travel independently?\n* You're not actually bothered about the cost of those things. You just want to hold them over her head in order to control her.\n* You don't know how much money you spent on her passion? That sounds like a **you** problem. Track your money better instead of blaming Anna for your failings.\n* You want her gone? Buy her a house or at the very least pay a rental deposit and twelve months of rent for her. Don't leave her on the hook for nine months so that you can force her into doing your bidding again in three months. That's despicable.\n* My outside perspective is that you are not fair.

I assume that if she felt it was enough to sit down and talk, that there's probably more to the story you're not telling. Regardless, it really does sound like you're offloading parental duties on yo your older children. You pretty much admit it in the second half of your post, that those are obligations you expect of her seeing as she doesn't pay rent.\n\nBy the way, it's even more concerning that you're doing it to your younger son too.

Then I head to pick up from school, do homework and delegate chores, cook dinner, signs forms, organize bedtime (read stories, check that people were in bed at the correct time, etc).

Her using that word is incredibly harmful because crying wolf like that makes it that much more difficult for legitimately parentified **children** to be taken seriously (when they claim it as a problem).  It is offensive (to anyone who has been through that issue) for a literal adult to claim parentification, especially when, even if we were talking about a teenager, none of these expectations would be abnormal.\n\nAccording to everything he posted, OP is a good father who's supported his child in every way he knows how.

But it really sounds like (to me) an entitled person who's been shown nothing but support.  Then, when it comes time for her to pay that support forward, she balks and misuses internet buzzwords to guilt trip her parent (over a level of responsibility that is entirely normal for a teenager, much less an adult who's being completely supported by said parent).\n\nObviously, OP could by lying (or omitting facts), but this sub is about taking the information given, then making a judgment.

You can disagree about the daughter's entitlement (which is completely subjective but, I feel, supported by the evidence at hand), but the daughter's claim of parentification is absolutely, objectively false (again, it is impossible for an adult to be parentified).

Parents who parentify their children tend to want the parenting child to stay as long as possible. At least that was my experience. I couldn't even spend the night with friends that often because \"who will get the kids up and feed them? Your sister will need a diaper change!\". Parentification is real and it's hard and heartbreaking. But I just don't see this being that at all.", "ESH/ I N F O\n\nFor the interaction where you told her to figure shit out, you are TA. She had work and was unable to be your babysitter. Missing work on short notice like that, even in an emergency situation, is not an option for many people. You are the parent, it was *your* job to \u201cfigure shit out\u201d.\n\nHer list is silly if she\u2019s living rent-free in your home. On the surface, those are reasonable expectations/ asks. HOWEVER:\n\n**Some of the wording and small details here lead me to believe you are greatly underrepresenting the responsibilities falling on your daughter.** Let\u2019s go through the list:\n\n1. You say that she has to cook a meal every week. You also say she took an interest in cooking at 14. Has she been required to cook for you all weekly ever since?? If not, when did this once a week cooking requirement start? It doesn\u2019t matter if at first she enjoyed it. If your daughter has been required to cook for her family and siblings since she was a teenager, that is 100% parentification.\n2. She has to keep her room and general stuff clean. What does \"general stuff\" entail? Are you asking her to just clean up after herself or is she also required to keep general/ common areas clean by vacuuming, dusting, and picking up clutter after her siblings? If it's the former, that\u2019s reasonable. If it\u2019s the latter, and you\u2019re also requiring her to cook for you\u2026 she\u2019s no longer living there rent-free. She\u2019s living there with the trade off of cooking and cleaning for your family. An acceptable tradeoff on it\u2019s own, but...\n3. 4. 5., The childcare. If she\u2019s willing to help out with these things, that\u2019s great! You should not be requiring or forcing her to do so. Also, who deems when the babysitting is \u201cnecessary\u201d? I assume that\u2019s your call, not really hers, based on the situation where you screamed at her .\n\nSo now let\u2019s look at your list, where you describe what you\u2019ve done in trade that you think is fair.\n\n1. She lives with you rent-free. I don\u2019t know how valid of a statement that is. If she\u2019s been required to cook since she was a teen and/or clean up after the whole family, then it\u2019s not really free. She\u2019s paying you back in cooking/cleaning services.\n2. You got her a car for her 18th birthday. Unless the car came with the explicit clause of having to provide any sort of service in the future, it\u2019s unfair to hold a gift over someone\u2019s head like that. It was a gift. However, she should pay for the insurance.\n3. Money you\u2019ve spent on her passion\u2026 you mean for cooking items in the kitchen? You can\u2019t hold this over her head either, expecting something in return. Especially when this isn\u2019t actually a gift, it\u2019s in your kitchen and benefits everyone.

So staying there to make sure her head doesn\u2019t move is feather important. As for head injuries, there is so much that can go wrong inside and not show itself.

You brought her into this world she didn't ask to be born. I think that your parental home should always be rent free.
