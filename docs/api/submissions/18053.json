{"id": 18053, "submission_id": "13qi0ic", "title": "AITA for telling my sister grieving her dog is not the same as me grieving my husband?", "selftext": "To make a long story short, I lost my husband only a month ago. It's hard, I'm still grieving and I miss him everyday. I have to take medication for depression and anxiety to help me get through the day.\n\nLast week, my sisters dog was put down due to some health issues and she was very upset, which is understandable. She called me as soon as it happened and said I was the only sibling who would understand her pain. \n\nI didn't mind, honestly I just wanted to comfort her since her dog meant the world to her. She held a wake for him and our whole family attended. It was a nice service. \n\nBut now, she's comparing our losses. Telling me she knows exactly what I'm going through. That she can relate to the pain of losing someone so close to you. She calls me asking if we should visit graves together. It was fine the first time but it's constant. She goes 3 times a day. It's already difficult to go once a week for me and she knows this. I feel like she's not even considering my own grief process. \n\nAnyway, I told her that grieving her dog is not the same as grieving my husband. She's upset and refusing to talk to me now. I get it, it was uncalled for really. But my loss is new to me too and I guess I just got frustrated with how different we're dealing with our losses. Idk I feel like she should understand where I'm coming from too. \n\nA dog is not the same as a husband. A dog can't love you back like a husband can. A dog can't read to your children like a husband can. A dog can't make soup when you're ill like  a husband can.\n\nIt's really hard for me right now to discern when I'm being condescending or not. Idk if it's a side effect of my medication, or if the empathetic part of my brain has shut down. But I really am getting tired of her comparing our pain when she lost her dog and I lost my world. At the very least, she still has her husband. \n\nI have two young children at home, processing a loss unimaginable to most kids their age. And she's trying to whisk me away to graveyards to visit her dog. \n\nAita?\n\nUpdate: There seems to be mixed opinions on this thread, which is fine. I guess people have different views on what asshole-ish behaviour is. \n\nFirst of all, I appreciate all of your condolences. There are just simply too many to like and respond to (although I think I got to upvote most of them) that I have decided to add it to an update. \n\nThis garnered far more attention than I expected to, in all honesty, I thought the first few comments were enough. Some of these comments did cheer me up. There was a whole etymology lesson in here at some point \ud83d\ude02\n\nSecondly, I know where I went wrong. It's the whole reason for the post, after all, and I can see where my sister went wrong. I will have an honest conversation with her at some point, and we have spoken since the incident. But it was mostly to do with our mother's birthday. I think we're both just in a place where the wounds are too fresh. It doesn't help that as a big sister, I am normally always her rock, but this time, I was more like a deflated balloon dealing with so many other things on my mind. It's been a rollercoaster this past month, and I think the graveyard visits were possibly more triggering than I realised at the time. I did want to be there for her initially, but it was just too much. \n\nIt was never my intention to minimise anyone's pain of losing a pet, I went through a moment of selfishness where I thought she could not possibly understand my pain. I know losing a pet is a painful process for many people (I'm not really a pet person, so I guess that's where my lack of understanding comes from). But at the time, I did not think of it as insulting because I did not mean to imply she shouldn't feel grief over a pet. I had meant it as she couldn't understand the continuous effects of losing your partner and co-parent. Something new always pops up that he would normally deal with, a plumbing issue, having to fix some shelves, the kids wanting to have a barbecue. I lack in so many things he could easily sort out, and it makes me feel like a horrible parent and wife, like I was burdening him with so much. \n\nI plan to explain all of this to her. I think she'll understand. We've been through worse, and we've made it out fine. I have faith that our relationship will only become stronger from this. I love her, and as much as I am her rock, she's mine. But in this one particular instance, perhaps it's safer for our relationship that we keep a distance. We're just too different when we grieve. It's not compatible. But that doesn't mean I don't care about what she's going through.", "created_utc": 1684925175, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qi0ic/aita_for_telling_my_sister_grieving_her_dog_is/", "score": 11305, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I am not going to be too mean to your sister, but she is being an asshole here.  Not just because dogs live shorter lives than humans so it is more expected, not just that, no matter how much we love animals, humans > other animals, but also because you can't necessarily compare grief in the first place.  Some people are comforted by sharing similar experiences; some people find it pushy, and if you start doing that and the other person doesn't like it, you stop.", "NTA\n\n  \n\n\nYour sister is entitled to her grief, however she should absolutely not be comparing it to the loss of your husband.\n\n  \n\n\nI would be pissed if I was in your situation", "NTA she lost a dog whilst she cared for her pet it was just that a pet. \n\nLossing a dog doesn't leave you worrying about paying the mortgage, how to care for your children etc. Yes she has grief but people need to stop comparing animals with humans.", "Absolutey NTA.\n\nA dog is not the same as a spouse. And your sister \u2014 though in her own pain from her own loss \u2014 should recognise that they're not the same thing, even remotely.", "NTA.   \nYour sister probably needs to talk to a grief counsellor \u2026 it sounds like she\u2019s really got a distorted reality running right now.   \n\n\nAnd for you\u2026 I really hope (the rest of) your family are really supportive and you are not just \u2018getting along\u2019. It might be time to call your mum and say \u201ccall sister and tell her to knock it off\u201d because\u2026 yeah, nope. No way is a much loved dog comparable to a husband.", "NTA - maybe if you said it the day the dog died, it would be a different story. But what your sister is doing is extremely insensitive.", "NTA. Your sister was out of line to even think loosing her dog is the same as loosing your husband. It would be just as insulting to say it was the same as loosing a parent or a child. Also your husband died a month ago and your sister thinks seeking out the person still dealing with grief to comfort her was a good idea. I'm sorry for your loss. Don't worry about your sister right now. There was selfishness to what she did. I guess misery really does love company.", "NTA. You said it perfectly\n\n>A dog is not the same as a husband. A dog can't love you back like a husband can. A dog can't read to your children like a husband can. A dog can't make soup when you're ill like a husband can.\n\nNot only that, but there is a lot more safety and stability in two adult family. You lost your safety net, other provider, any help around the house. You lost your children's father. I love dogs, I have dogs, but a fucking dog is not the same as your life partner.\n\nYou know who else lost their dog? You know who else went through exactly what your sister went through? Your sister's husband. So maybe she should go to him to get emotional support, remember that you can no longer do that and find some perspective.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss. Focus on yourself and your children now. If going to the grave will help you, do it, but if it won't, don't. Your sister can look for support elsewhere (her husband!), you don't have to feel guilty for not being able to help her too. Just getting you and children through one day at a time is enough for now.", "NTA. I've lost a husband, and a dog that was my best friend and there with me through EVERYTHING (including the loss of my husband). This dog carried my emotional baggage FOR me and was a huge source of love and comfort during my darkest times.\n\nLosing the dog STILL doesn't compare to losing a human loved one.\n\nThe biggest reason, at least in my mind, is that we EXPECT to outlive our furry friends. They simply have shorter life spans.", "NTA. You lost your husband and have two kids who lost their dad. You have enough grief on your plate. Your sister says you're the only one who can understand how she feels, well it doesn't sound like she's considering how you feel because she's just adding to your already heavy load with her own grief.\n\nI had to put down my dog recently. I was devastated. But I cannot imagine in any world going to someone who just lost their husband and father of their children for support with that. \n\nMaybe you could have handled it more tactfully by just saying you can't be her support right now but I don't think you're the asshole here.", "NTA, losing your husband is one of the worst losses you can have in life. I'd say the only thing that truly competes is loosing a child.\n\nHowever, I'll have to fight you. My dog can love me back better then a husband ever could thank you very much. /j", "NTA, but pets do show love and affection in their own way .her pushing her grief and coping isn't good tho. She should understand that both of you are grieving and let that be according to how each wants .", "Nta", "You are not the AH. She can go to the dogs gravesite and deal with her loss however she feels like. \nThe same, you have the right to grieve your own loss as you need to. Let her know (very nicely) that you need your own space for you and your children to grieve their father so you can't go with her to the dog's gravesite. She can always ask her husband to go with her.\n\nI hope that you and your family get the strength and support that you all need. \nMy bestie lost her amazing husband 10 years ago having a young kid to take care of and no. It's not the same as a dog. We still get happy/sad remembering him and telling her son stories about his dad.\n\nMaybe talk to a member of the family (husband?) that could suggest for her to go to grieve counselor because her mourning is getting the best of her and keeping her from reality.", "NTA.\n\nAnd first of all sorry for your loss.   Pets aren't people.  I understand people love their pets immensely, but that fact doesn't change.  You don't commit your life to a pet.  You can't have a two way conversation with a pet.  You can't raise a family with a pet.   There are people in this thread saying YTA for comparing but I mostly just feel sorry for anyone who hasn't loved another human enough to understand the difference between losing a pet and a loved one.  I just lost my dog a couple months ago and I'd had him since he was a few weeks old.  I was completely devastated, but I knew when I got him how long he was expected to live.  People plan their entire lives around marriage.  You can never fully be prepared to lose a partner like that.   \n\nAlso that being said I'm sorry for your sister's loss.  It sounds like she is having g a really tough time and not handling it well.  I hope she's able to lean on her husband some during this time though - I'm assuming he lost the same pet that he loved.  Hopefully you two can get back to a healthy relationship once you've both gotten to a better place.", "NTA. She was incredibly insensitive to your grief. Yes it\u2019s sad that she lost a dog but it\u2019s nowhere near the same as losing your husband and father of your children.", "It's not a competition. I'm gonna go with NAH, grief does fucked up  shit to you. Of course there is no comparison, we enter into a relationship with our dogs knowing that we will outlive them. It sucks, but it's par for the course. You enter into a marriage thinking that you have a partner for most, if not all of your life. I think you should have been less harsh with your sister, on some level she knows that her grief isn't the same, but this is how she is coping. I am sorry for your loss, and hers. I hope that as time passes you can get past this with her, it sounds like you mat need each other.", "NAH\n\nI understand how deeply many dog owners love their dogs, I do. But that doesn't make losing a dog comparable to losing a husband. Not for me, no way.\n\nBut regardless of that, grief isn't a competition. It's a horrible experience that no one chooses to go through, but we all know that the risk of loving is the possibility of losing. It's a hard hard hard thing.\n\nI think though, rather than framing this as being about which loss is greater (even though I agree with you that yours is), it would be more productive to explain that you are both grieving and that you are entitled to process your grief in different ways.\n\nFor her, that may mean visiting her dog's graveside 3 times a day but that isn't what you need and you don't feel that she's respecting your need to grieve in your own way. Her own grief is making her insensitive to how immense the loss that you and your kids are going through really is. \n\nIf you need to, reduce contact for now. That's got to be better than losing your close sibling relationship at such an incredibly hard time. \n\nI'm very very very deeply sorry for your loss.", "NAH\n\nSorry this happened to you. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone here benefits from measuring grief in a hierarchy. Grief is devastating and unique to everyone\u2019s circumstances. It says a lot about you that you were able to acknowledge your sister\u2019s grief and offer support while yours is so fresh. \n\nIt appears your sister hasn\u2019t yet been able to see through her grief enough to recognize how yours (and your children\u2019s) is still in full swing, which makes it fair that you had to set some kind of boundary. While downplaying her grief is not ideal, your grief deserves respect.", "Look I lost my dog of 14 years recently, we did everything together. I have a child who\u2019s 10, I can\u2019t even think of losing them. It would kill me. But my dog was everything. He was with me a quarter of my life. That\u2019s a long fucking time. Grief is grief no matter how you put it. I still miss the shit out of him. I have a shrine next to my bed. I loved that dog! Please try to understand. It hell hard to lose anything. I knew a neighbor who lost his wife of 50 years he had her ring around his neck. He was doing yard work and lost it in the yard. He was devastated had the whole neighborhood looking for this ring day n night. It was so sad to watch him at night looking for it with a flashlight.", "You have every right to grieve in your own way and you can tell other people that you don't want company for it.\n\nBut it was an A-hole move of you to tell her that it's not the same. How dare you classify someone else's grief?! You said that this dog meant the world to her. Also it's not true that a dog can't love someone back. This is actually the biggest bullshit of all the bullshits you wrote in your post.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. I really do. But YTA. Not for not wanting to go to see the graves 3 times a day with your sister. But for belittling her grief.", "NAH - you both have suffered a great loss. I know it's not comparable, but research has proven that the loss of a pet can be as painful for some people as the loss of a family member. You aren't wrong to tell her that her dog is not the same as your husband, though. Regardless of the grief you are both feeling, you don't have to have your circumstances put down for her.\n\nI do suggest grief therapy for all involved and I'm sorry for your loss.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "NAH but grief is grief.  My husband of 42 years passed away in January, and then I had to have his dog put down in May.  Honestly, both deaths are devastating.  I cry over both of them.  They both loved me.  They were both companions to me.  Anyway, the literature I was given says you can't rank grief, and that suppressing it can make your grieving period longer.  Expecting you to go visit her dog's grave frequently is a bit much IMO.  You have your own things to do, and you have small children who've lost their father.  I'm very sorry for your loss.", "NAH\n\nShe tried to find unity and comfort, you try to manage the pain.\n\nA little harsh from you and a little unsensitive of her.\nNo big issue.\nTell her you are sorry and acted out and it will be OK.", "Ok, I\u2019m leaning towards YTA\u2026and maybe you need to take a step back from your grief. \n\nYour sister *did* suffer a loss. That *was* a member of her family. And I\u2019m sure a bunch of people will come at me because humans and animals are different\u2026but for a lot of people, pets are every bit as important to them as children or spouses. Therefore, the impact TO HER is every bit as much of a gut punch as you losing your husband. \n\nIt\u2019s not a competition. You both experienced a loss, and you\u2019re both dealing with the emotional upheaval that comes with that and figuring out your \u201cnew normal.\u201d I\u2019ve lost human family members and pets - the BOTH hurt just as badly. So stop with the \u201cit\u2019s just a dog\u201d garbage. To her, that dog was family. YTA. \n\nBut, you also have quite a bit on your plate. You lost a husband, which presumably means that (aside from companionship) you also lost and income stream and a partner in parenting to your children. Plus your kids are grieving too. You\u2019ve got a lot on your plate with figuring what your family life is like now and how it all works, in addition to the heartache. So\u2026perhaps she shouldn\u2019t be dragging you to cemeteries and whatnot. Honestly though\u2026it sounds like she\u2019s looking for some support, and since she sees you as suffering a loss too, she thinks you could lean on each other to get through it. I think a heart to heart conversation with her about your challenges and how her actions make you feel might go a long way\u2026and I think you two could actually be great support once you work out what that looks like. The ones who understand grief best are the ones also grieving.", "YTA grief is grief. It\u2019s not a competition.", "Ur mad at her for the same thing YOU are doing- comparing despair. It sounds like projection. Expressing frustration for not respecting ur grieving process is fine but everything else is out of pocket.

You're not just grieving the 10 missed years with your pet, your grieving your whole planned future. What your kids will miss, what you'll miss, growing old together. The big moments, the small moments. Your entire life got dumped on its ass when your partner passed away, you not only lost your companion, you lost your buisness partner, your project manager, your children's father, he was someone's son, someone's friend. Freya was my whole world, she was no one else's. Losing a partner isn't just losing a person, everyone around them loses their version of the person. I didn't even lose my partner, just for two weeks I had to plan my life like he wouldn't be there in 2 months.\n\nNTA x100.", "Definitely NTA.  I mean, hypothetically, if she acted that way because her beloved pet ferret passed away, then it would be 100% clear to her what the right answer is.  Yes, dogs are different from ferrets . . .  but are they really in this context?  Cats?  Parrots?", "NTA. And I\u2019m currently grieving a dog. But you can\u2019t compare it to a spouse, and she needs to respect your grieving and boundaries.", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I\u2019m sorry for your sister\u2019s loss too. However, your sister is being insensitive. These are not the same kinds of losses at all.", "NTA\n\nSometimes losing a pet can hurt as much as almost any other grief. It's profound and devastating. BUT you never tell someone you hurt as much as them and constantly compare your grief to theirs. \n\nYour sister constantly trying to play \"samsies\" with pain is really presumptuous and lacking in empathy. \n\nThe best thing I ever heard about grief was,  paraphrased:  \n \n\"I won't talk about it as if I know. No one knows. People act like they know, they don't. This is yours.\"", "NAH. \n\nIt sounds like your sister is genuinely trying to connect with you through a shared time of grief in your lives, which is fine; but it\u2019s not working for you and only making yours worse, which is also fine. It\u2019s one thing to acknowledge you\u2019re both grieving someone who was important to you, but comparing grief is a losing game for everyone and your sister shouldn\u2019t be forcing her comparisons on you when it\u2019s definitely not how you view it.\n\nThis is hard because I get where your sister\u2019s grief is coming from. As someone with zero plans to marry or have children, other than when I lose my parents and if my sibling goes before me, I know that when the day comes that I lose the dog who saved my life when I was in a deep depression it will be one of the hardest things I ever through. Just typing that has me in tears because that dog is my family and I love him with all of my heart. That said, I do personally agree with you that it\u2019s not the same as- especially prematurely as it sounds here- losing the person you were supposed to have a whole life with. I think if you can have a gentle conversation with your sister where you tell her you need a break from talking about your losses, that might be everyone\u2019s best longterm interests. You don\u2019t want to discount or dismiss her grief, but it sounds like you\u2019re feeling like yours is being cheapened as it stands; and that\u2019s not ok either. If she refuses to stop talking to you about it and insists on continuing to say it\u2019s the same to her after that, well then Y W N T A for continuing to tell her to stop. \n\nAlso, side note for what it\u2019s worth; I take a anti-anxiety medication as needed, and as it absolutely messes with my emotions. For me, it\u2019s numbness, then a few hours of extreme irritability as it wears off. I\u2019m not a medical professional, but if you\u2019re worried about why your empathy and emotional reading skills are off, talk to yours and can tell you if the medication your on is the likely culprit.", "NTA.

I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA - Every loss impacts us all differently. I\u2019ve loved all my animals, they\u2019re family and it always hurts so much.. I lost 5 members of my family in a few months, one specific uncles death pushed me over the edge. Then last year, in November, I lost my baby. I had always thought the pain of such a thing must be the worst thing in the world, but until you go through it, you can\u2019t even get close to understanding the pain of it. \n\nI understand your sister is grieving, but she\u2019s TA for comparing grief\u2026 I imagine you bit your tongue until it became unbearable, I don\u2019t think your TA for that.", "NTA, don't get me wrong I couldn't imagine losing my dog and no I would be awful but losing my husband I'm assuming would be soul destroying.\nThe two should never be compared and she needs to understand that.\nNot only are you grieving but your also grieving for your children and trying to be there for them.\nJust being there for your sister once or twice was long enough and so supportive with what your going through.

That is definitely selfish and self-centered on her part!", "I believe grief is grief and deeply personal.  Grieving a pet or person is still Grieving.  A little empathy goes a long way and negating another's grief is always an AH move.  Perhaps just say \"I don't want to be sad...let's talk about something else \" or find another way to deflect.

As some have said, there are people who love their dogs this much, and it's not ok to gatekeep grief.  But to actually verbalize her feelings that the loss is comprable is batshit territory.

I love m\u2019y dog more than anything, but the grief of losing a pet will never compare to the grief of losing a partner. All the people in our lives have roles and it\u2019s awful to lose anyone, but dogs don\u2019t live forever, so unless someone has underlying reasons for being extremely attached e.g. is lonely, never had kids, etc, it\u2019s not healthy to have this extreme a reaction, and it\u2019s thoughtless to think the two types of grief compare. My guess is she\u2019s either trying to steal the focus and is jealous you\u2019re getting more attention, or there\u2019s something else causing her to get this upset and the dog had higher significance than just a pet, and she\u2019s having a mental health spiral. Doesn\u2019t excuse her behaviour whatsoever though. My advice would just be to stay away but also be civil. If she\u2019s acting like this there can\u2019t be much reasoning with her. Nobody with an ounce of compassion would be that cruel to a grieving widow", "I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re necessarily wrong in your comment, however maybe you should\u2019ve just told her that now isn\u2019t the right time, and that your mourning process is different than hers. Grieving someone important in your life feels different to everyone, some can handle it better than other, while some like your sister can\u2019t really understand why her grief isn\u2019t prioritized by everyone. Ultimately I believe you\u2019re NTA, but maybe a little bit of distance between you and your sister, resulting from your comment, will help both of you", "Oh dear.that's a tough one.

To give yourself permission to just enjoy a sunrise, eat a froyo, laugh at a joke, and not be sad at that moment. To let other feelings exist. And if you can do it once, you can do it again.  And someday, you might find that waking up hurts just a little bit less than it did yesterday.\n\n@OP:  Pain is real, even when it's illogical.

The problem is that she is undermining your grief to feel better about hers. Grief isn't comparable, and it seems like she is making a point to you that it is. Even if she lost a husband instead of a dog, or you lost a dog instead of a husband, different people react to things differently, and you two would still not be the same.

Years ago, I had a huge falling out with my college friendship group because one of them compared me skipping drama practice on my first birthday following my Nana\u2019s death to them still going to school after their dog died.

My brother and his wife recently lost a puppy that they doted on like a child. It was deeply traumatic for them, and bereavement counselling has been discussed.

It\u2019s not the same - every loss is different, as is how each individual processes it.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, I think that you might need to be open with your sister about how, while you\u2019re sympathetic towards her pain, that it\u2019s all too overwhelming while you\u2019re still trying to process yours, and that you need your space so you and your children can grieve in your own way. It might also be worth reaching out to her husband, and ask if he can try to be her rock instead?\n\nWhen people are experiencing a lot of emotion, as so happens with grief, things can end up said more harshly than we intend.

She has nothing else to compare it to, and she's drowning in grief. \n\nI think it's only once a person has had the misfortune to reflect back on multiple losses that they can truly understand the differences - certainly not while they're still grieving. I've lost pregnancies, a child, both of my parents, pets, and I experienced each loss and grieving process differently. I've also had people who have experienced similar losses tell me they know exactly how I'm feeling.

Grief is grief, whether it's your parent, your child, your sibling, your spouse, your pet, etc. The holes they've left in your life are what's different, and obviously, the hole left by the loss of one's pet - regardless of how much you love them (and I'm a dog person), cannot be compared to the hole left by the death of a spouse.\n\nIdeally, people wouldn't make comparisons, but nobody is perfect, especially when they're grieving. Some make the comparison as a way to connect with another grieving person, and it sounds like that is what your sister is trying to do. Unfortunately, her grief isn't letting her see the situation clearly at the moment. Hopefully, if she could, she would realize that your loss is very different from hers, and that each person needs to grieve in their own way - not in someone else's way.\n\nI hope that time dulls the sharp edges of your grief and that it will eventually become easier to live with.", "NTA AT ALL.

Instead you tried to also be there for her, got resentful, and ended up saying something hurtful to someone who is also grieving a loss.  \n\n\nGrief can hit people in really weird ways. When my father died, my mother and I processed it in very different ways and I got a lot of judgement from her as a result. As a result, I caution anyone judging the grief of others and how it is expressed. Going to the grave three times a day sounds excessive to me, but maybe it's what she needs right now. But that also doesn't mean you need to go with her or that she shouldn't respect your grieving process. If she doesn't, then simply tell her no you're not going and that's it. Make a clear boundary that you can not provide the emotional support she needs right now because of your own situation.

I firmly believe he made sure to leave me with her because after he passed I was broken, but I had to keep going for her. She saved my life because he made sure not to leave me alone.

Losing a person, especially a partner, changes your entire life forever, on top of losing someone you committed your entire life to. Compared to dogs, who you know when you adopt them that you will outlive them, it's much less of a commitment than a marriage with kids and a mortgage, someone you rely on every day for a couple big things and hundreds of little things. Not to mention, the only reason you would make that kind of commitment is if this person is the love of your life, your favorite out of all the people you've ever met, you only get one so you better think it through (not like dogs that you can easily re-home if it doesn't work out, or adopt multiple, no need to only choose one forever and feel the full weight of that commitment).
