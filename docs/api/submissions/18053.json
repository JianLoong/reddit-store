It's hard, I'm still grieving and I miss him everyday. I have to take medication for depression and anxiety to help me get through the day.\n\nLast week, my sisters dog was put down due to some health issues and she was very upset, which is understandable. She called me as soon as it happened and said I was the only sibling who would understand her pain. \n\nI didn't mind, honestly I just wanted to comfort her since her dog meant the world to her. She held a wake for him and our whole family attended. It was a nice service. \n\nBut now, she's comparing our losses. Telling me she knows exactly what I'm going through. That she can relate to the pain of losing someone so close to you. She calls me asking if we should visit graves together. It was fine the first time but it's constant. She goes 3 times a day. It's already difficult to go once a week for me and she knows this. I feel like she's not even considering my own grief process. \n\nAnyway, I told her that grieving her dog is not the same as grieving my husband. She's upset and refusing to talk to me now. I get it, it was uncalled for really. But my loss is new to me too and I guess I just got frustrated with how different we're dealing with our losses. Idk I feel like she should understand where I'm coming from too. \n\nA dog is not the same as a husband. A dog can't love you back like a husband can. A dog can't read to your children like a husband can. A dog can't make soup when you're ill like  a husband can.\n\nIt's really hard for me right now to discern when I'm being condescending or not. Idk if it's a side effect of my medication, or if the empathetic part of my brain has shut down. But I really am getting tired of her comparing our pain when she lost her dog and I lost my world. At the very least, she still has her husband. \n\nI have two young children at home, processing a loss unimaginable to most kids their age.

Your sister is insane.  \n\nThere's no use telling her that though. There's no point to arguing that \"losing a dog is not the same as losing a husband.\"  I suspect that's what she may want. An argument. Don't engage.  You could end up pissing her off and losing the relationship with your sister.\n\nJust avoid any further interaction or discussion with her about your husband or her dog, as she's not capable of rationally discussing either topic.", "NTA.  I am not going to be too mean to your sister, but she is being an asshole here.  Not just because dogs live shorter lives than humans so it is more expected, not just that, no matter how much we love animals, humans > other animals, but also because you can't necessarily compare grief in the first place.  Some people are comforted by sharing similar experiences; some people find it pushy, and if you start doing that and the other person doesn't like it, you stop.", "NTA\n\n  \n\n\nYour sister is entitled to her grief, however she should absolutely not be comparing it to the loss of your husband.\n\n  \n\n\nI would be pissed if I was in your situation", "NTA she lost a dog whilst she cared for her pet it was just that a pet. \n\nLossing a dog doesn't leave you worrying about paying the mortgage, how to care for your children etc. Yes she has grief but people need to stop comparing animals with humans.", "Absolutey NTA.\n\nA dog is not the same as a spouse. And your sister \u2014 though in her own pain from her own loss \u2014 should recognise that they're not the same thing, even remotely.", "NTA.   \nYour sister probably needs to talk to a grief counsellor \u2026 it sounds like she\u2019s really got a distorted reality running right now.   \n\n\nAnd for you\u2026 I really hope (the rest of) your family are really supportive and you are not just \u2018getting along\u2019. It might be time to call your mum and say \u201ccall sister and tell her to knock it off\u201d because\u2026 yeah, nope. No way is a much loved dog comparable to a husband.", "NTA - maybe if you said it the day the dog died, it would be a different story. But what your sister is doing is extremely insensitive.", "NTA. Your sister was out of line to even think loosing her dog is the same as loosing your husband. It would be just as insulting to say it was the same as loosing a parent or a child. Also your husband died a month ago and your sister thinks seeking out the person still dealing with grief to comfort her was a good idea. I'm sorry for your loss. Don't worry about your sister right now. There was selfishness to what she did. I guess misery really does love company.", "NTA. You said it perfectly\n\n>A dog is not the same as a husband. A dog can't love you back like a husband can. A dog can't read to your children like a husband can. A dog can't make soup when you're ill like a husband can.\n\nNot only that, but there is a lot more safety and stability in two adult family. You lost your safety net, other provider, any help around the house. You lost your children's father. I love dogs, I have dogs, but a fucking dog is not the same as your life partner.\n\nYou know who else lost their dog? You know who else went through exactly what your sister went through? Your sister's husband. So maybe she should go to him to get emotional support, remember that you can no longer do that and find some perspective.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss. Focus on yourself and your children now. If going to the grave will help you, do it, but if it won't, don't. Your sister can look for support elsewhere (her husband!), you don't have to feel guilty for not being able to help her too. Just getting you and children through one day at a time is enough for now.", "NTA. I've lost a husband, and a dog that was my best friend and there with me through EVERYTHING (including the loss of my husband). This dog carried my emotional baggage FOR me and was a huge source of love and comfort during my darkest times.\n\nLosing the dog STILL doesn't compare to losing a human loved one.\n\nThe biggest reason, at least in my mind, is that we EXPECT to outlive our furry friends. They simply have shorter life spans.", "NTA. You lost your husband and have two kids who lost their dad. You have enough grief on your plate. Your sister says you're the only one who can understand how she feels, well it doesn't sound like she's considering how you feel because she's just adding to your already heavy load with her own grief.\n\nI had to put down my dog recently. I was devastated. But I cannot imagine in any world going to someone who just lost their husband and father of their children for support with that. \n\nMaybe you could have handled it more tactfully by just saying you can't be her support right now but I don't think you're the asshole here.", "NTA, losing your husband is one of the worst losses you can have in life. I'd say the only thing that truly competes is loosing a child.\n\nHowever, I'll have to fight you. My dog can love me back better then a husband ever could thank you very much. /j", "NTA, but pets do show love and affection in their own way .her pushing her grief and coping isn't good tho. She should understand that both of you are grieving and let that be according to how each wants .", "Nta", "You are not the AH. She can go to the dogs gravesite and deal with her loss however she feels like. \nThe same, you have the right to grieve your own loss as you need to. Let her know (very nicely) that you need your own space for you and your children to grieve their father so you can't go with her to the dog's gravesite. She can always ask her husband to go with her.\n\nI hope that you and your family get the strength and support that you all need. \nMy bestie lost her amazing husband 10 years ago having a young kid to take care of and no. It's not the same as a dog. We still get happy/sad remembering him and telling her son stories about his dad.\n\nMaybe talk to a member of the family (husband?) that could suggest for her to go to grieve counselor because her mourning is getting the best of her and keeping her from reality.", "NTA.\n\nAnd first of all sorry for your loss.   Pets aren't people.  I understand people love their pets immensely, but that fact doesn't change.  You don't commit your life to a pet.  You can't have a two way conversation with a pet.  You can't raise a family with a pet.   There are people in this thread saying YTA for comparing but I mostly just feel sorry for anyone who hasn't loved another human enough to understand the difference between losing a pet and a loved one.  I just lost my dog a couple months ago and I'd had him since he was a few weeks old.  I was completely devastated, but I knew when I got him how long he was expected to live.  People plan their entire lives around marriage.  You can never fully be prepared to lose a partner like that.   \n\nAlso that being said I'm sorry for your sister's loss.  It sounds like she is having g a really tough time and not handling it well.  I hope she's able to lean on her husband some during this time though - I'm assuming he lost the same pet that he loved.  Hopefully you two can get back to a healthy relationship once you've both gotten to a better place.", "NTA. She was incredibly insensitive to your grief. Yes it\u2019s sad that she lost a dog but it\u2019s nowhere near the same as losing your husband and father of your children.", "It's not a competition. I'm gonna go with NAH, grief does fucked up  shit to you. Of course there is no comparison, we enter into a relationship with our dogs knowing that we will outlive them. It sucks, but it's par for the course. You enter into a marriage thinking that you have a partner for most, if not all of your life. I think you should have been less harsh with your sister, on some level she knows that her grief isn't the same, but this is how she is coping. I am sorry for your loss, and hers. I hope that as time passes you can get past this with her, it sounds like you mat need each other.", "NAH\n\nI understand how deeply many dog owners love their dogs, I do. But that doesn't make losing a dog comparable to losing a husband. Not for me, no way.\n\nBut regardless of that, grief isn't a competition. It's a horrible experience that no one chooses to go through, but we all know that the risk of loving is the possibility of losing. It's a hard hard hard thing.\n\nI think though, rather than framing this as being about which loss is greater (even though I agree with you that yours is), it would be more productive to explain that you are both grieving and that you are entitled to process your grief in different ways.\n\nFor her, that may mean visiting her dog's graveside 3 times a day but that isn't what you need and you don't feel that she's respecting your need to grieve in your own way. Her own grief is making her insensitive to how immense the loss that you and your kids are going through really is. \n\nIf you need to, reduce contact for now. That's got to be better than losing your close sibling relationship at such an incredibly hard time. \n\nI'm very very very deeply sorry for your loss.", "NAH\n\nSorry this happened to you. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone here benefits from measuring grief in a hierarchy. Grief is devastating and unique to everyone\u2019s circumstances. It says a lot about you that you were able to acknowledge your sister\u2019s grief and offer support while yours is so fresh. \n\nIt appears your sister hasn\u2019t yet been able to see through her grief enough to recognize how yours (and your children\u2019s) is still in full swing, which makes it fair that you had to set some kind of boundary. While downplaying her grief is not ideal, your grief deserves respect.", "Look I lost my dog of 14 years recently, we did everything together. I have a child who\u2019s 10, I can\u2019t even think of losing them. It would kill me. But my dog was everything. He was with me a quarter of my life. That\u2019s a long fucking time. Grief is grief no matter how you put it. I still miss the shit out of him. I have a shrine next to my bed. I loved that dog! Please try to understand. It hell hard to lose anything. I knew a neighbor who lost his wife of 50 years he had her ring around his neck. He was doing yard work and lost it in the yard. He was devastated had the whole neighborhood looking for this ring day n night. It was so sad to watch him at night looking for it with a flashlight.", "You have every right to grieve in your own way and you can tell other people that you don't want company for it.\n\nBut it was an A-hole move of you to tell her that it's not the same. How dare you classify someone else's grieve?! You said that this dog meant the world to her. Also it's not true that a dog can't love someone back. This is actually the biggest bullshit of all the bullshits you wrote in your post.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. I really do. But YTA. Not for not wanting to go to see the graves 3 times a day with your sister. But for belittling her grieve.", "NAH - you both have suffered a great loss. I know it's not comparable, but research has proven that the loss of a pet can be as painful for some people as the loss of a family member. You aren't wrong to tell her that her dog is not the same as your husband, though. Regardless of the grief you are both feeling, you don't have to have your circumstances put down for her.\n\nI do suggest grief therapy for all involved and I'm sorry for your loss.", "NAH. Everyone here has experienced loss. From what you describe, she is trying to relate to you and support each other. So you don\u2019t want to visit a gravesite? Tell her that. Everyone grieves differently. You say you\u2019re upset she is \u201ccomparing\u201d losses, but isn\u2019t that what you\u2019re doing?", "[deleted]", "NAH but grief is grief.  My husband of 42 years passed away in January, and then I had to have his dog put down in May.  Honestly, both deaths are devastating.  I cry over both of them.  They both loved me.  They were both companions to me.  Anyway, the literature I was given says you can't rank grief, and that suppressing it can make your grieving period longer.  Expecting you to go visit her dog's grave frequently is a bit much IMO.  You have your own things to do, and you have small children who've lost their father.  I'm very sorry for your loss.", "NAH\n\nShe tried to find unity and comfort, you try to manage the pain.\n\nA little harsh from you and a little unsensitive of her.\nNo big issue.\nTell her you are sorry and acted out and it will be OK.", "Ok, I\u2019m leaning towards YTA\u2026and maybe you need to take a step back from your grief. \n\nYour sister *did* suffer a loss. That *was* a member of her family. And I\u2019m sure a bunch of people will come at me because humans and animals are different\u2026but for a lot of people, pets are every bit as important to them as children or spouses. Therefore, the impact TO HER is every bit as much of a gut punch as you losing your husband. \n\nIt\u2019s not a competition. You both experienced a loss, and you\u2019re both dealing with the emotional upheaval that comes with that and figuring out your \u201cnew normal.\u201d I\u2019ve lost human family members and pets - the BOTH hurt just as badly. So stop with the \u201cit\u2019s just a dog\u201d garbage. To her, that dog was family. YTA. \n\nBut, you also have quite a bit on your plate. You lost a husband, which presumably means that (aside from companionship) you also lost and income stream and a partner in parenting to your children. Plus your kids are grieving too. You\u2019ve got a lot on your plate with figuring what your family life is like now and how it all works, in addition to the heartache. So\u2026perhaps she shouldn\u2019t be dragging you to cemeteries and whatnot. Honestly though\u2026it sounds like she\u2019s looking for some support, and since she sees you as suffering a loss too, she thinks you could lean on each other to get through it. I think a heart to heart conversation with her about your challenges and how her actions make you feel might go a long way\u2026and I think you two could actually be great support once you work out what that looks like. The ones who understand grief best are the ones also grieving.", "YTA grief is grief. It\u2019s not a competition.", "Ur mad at her for the same thing YOU are doing- comparing despair. It sounds like projection. Expressing frustration for not respecting ur grieving process is fine but everything else is out of pocket.

Funny how some baboons here call you YTA, who compares the loss of a pet with a husband/father/grandfather etc etc etc? It makes 0 sense. Obviously losing your husband is 1000x times worse than your sister losing her dear dog.", "I didn't even think of the fact she had her husband to turn to. Wow, I feel stupid now. I should've just told her then that I couldn't cope with more than my own loss now, and she had someone else to turn to. Would've saved our relationship from this weird competition bullshit.", "Thank you for sharing your own loss with me. I really wish I hadn't said what I did because I truly love my sister more than anything. \n\nIf I didn't have my own shit to deal with, I definitely would be expressing the same empathy as she showed me, but my head is all over the place lately.

I don't have time to visit a graveyard thrice a day.", "It isn't the same. The sister lost a cherished pet but one she most likely was going to outlive. She still has her own husband to turn to for comfort and support.\n\nOP lost *her* husband and the father of their two children.
