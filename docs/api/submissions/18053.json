It's hard, I'm still grieving and I miss him everyday. I have to take medication for depression and anxiety to help me get through the day.\n\nLast week, my sisters dog was put down due to some health issues and she was very upset, which is understandable. She called me as soon as it happened and said I was the only sibling who would understand her pain. \n\nI didn't mind, honestly I just wanted to comfort her since her dog meant the world to her. She held a wake for him and our whole family attended. It was a nice service. \n\nBut now, she's comparing our losses. Telling me she knows exactly what I'm going through. That she can relate to the pain of losing someone so close to you. She calls me asking if we should visit graves together. It was fine the first time but it's constant. She goes 3 times a day. It's already difficult to go once a week for me and she knows this. I feel like she's not even considering my own grief process. \n\nAnyway, I told her that grieving her dog is not the same as grieving my husband. She's upset and refusing to talk to me now. I get it, it was uncalled for really. But my loss is new to me too and I guess I just got frustrated with how different we're dealing with our losses. Idk I feel like she should understand where I'm coming from too. \n\nA dog is not the same as a husband. A dog can't love you back like a husband can. A dog can't read to your children like a husband can. A dog can't make soup when you're ill like  a husband can.\n\nIt's really hard for me right now to discern when I'm being condescending or not. Idk if it's a side effect of my medication, or if the empathetic part of my brain has shut down. But I really am getting tired of her comparing our pain when she lost her dog and I lost my world. At the very least, she still has her husband. \n\nI have two young children at home, processing a loss unimaginable to most kids their age. And she's trying to whisk me away to graveyards to visit her dog. \n\nAita?", "created_utc": 1684925175, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13qi0ic/aita_for_telling_my_sister_grieving_her_dog_is/", "score": 2348, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your sister is insane.  \n\nThere's no use telling her that though. There's no point to arguing that \"losing a dog is not the same as losing a husband.\"  I suspect that's what she may want. An argument. Don't engage.  You could end up pissing her off and losing the relationship with your sister.\n\nJust avoid any further interaction or discussion with her about your husband or her dog, as she's not capable of rationally discussing either topic.", "NTA.  I am not going to be too mean to your sister, but she is being an asshole here.  Not just because dogs live shorter lives than humans so it is more expected, not just that, no matter how much we love animals, humans > other animals, but also because you can't necessarily compare grief in the first place.  Some people are comforted by sharing similar experiences; some people find it pushy, and if you start doing that and the other person doesn't like it, you stop.", "NTA\n\n  \n\n\nYour sister is entitled to her grief, however she should absolutely not be comparing it to the loss of your husband.\n\n  \n\n\nI would be pissed if I was in your situation", "NTA she lost a dog whilst she cared for her pet it was just that a pet. \n\nLossing a dog doesn't leave you worrying about paying the mortgage, how to care for your children etc. Yes she has grief but people need to stop comparing animals with humans.", "Absolutey NTA.\n\nA dog is not the same as a spouse. And your sister \u2014 though in her own pain from her own loss \u2014 should recognise that they're not the same thing, even remotely.", "NTA.   \nYour sister probably needs to talk to a grief counsellor \u2026 it sounds like she\u2019s really got a distorted reality running right now.   \n\n\nAnd for you\u2026 I really hope (the rest of) your family are really supportive and you are not just \u2018getting along\u2019. It might be time to call your mum and say \u201ccall sister and tell her to knock it off\u201d because\u2026 yeah, nope. No way is a much loved dog comparable to a husband.", "NTA - maybe if you said it the day the dog died, it would be a different story. But what your sister is doing is extremely insensitive.", "NTA. Your sister was out of line to even think loosing her dog is the same as loosing your husband. It would be just as insulting to say it was the same as loosing a parent or a child. Also your husband died a month ago and your sister thinks seeking out the person still dealing with grief to comfort her was a good idea. I'm sorry for your loss. Don't worry about your sister right now. There was selfishness to what she did. I guess misery really does love company.", "NTA. You said it perfectly\n\n>A dog is not the same as a husband. A dog can't love you back like a husband can. A dog can't read to your children like a husband can. A dog can't make soup when you're ill like a husband can.\n\nNot only that, but there is a lot more safety and stability in two adult family. You lost your safety net, other provider, any help around the house. You lost your children's father. I love dogs, I have dogs, but a fucking dog is not the same as your life partner.\n\nYou know who else lost their dog? You know who else went through exactly what your sister went through? Your sister's husband. So maybe she should go to him to get emotional support, remember that you can no longer do that and find some perspective.\n\nI am so sorry for your loss. Focus on yourself and your children now. If going to the grave will help you, do it, but if it won't, don't. Your sister can look for support elsewhere (her husband!), you don't have to feel guilty for not being able to help her too. Just getting you and children through one day at a time is enough for now.", "NTA. I've lost a husband, and a dog that was my best friend and there with me through EVERYTHING (including the loss of my husband). This dog carried my emotional baggage FOR me and was a huge source of love and comfort during my darkest times.\n\nLosing the dog STILL doesn't compare to losing a human loved one.\n\nThe biggest reason, at least in my mind, is that we EXPECT to outlive our furry friends. They simply have shorter life spans.", "NTA. You lost your husband and have two kids who lost their dad. You have enough grief on your plate. Your sister says you're the only one who can understand how she feels, well it doesn't sound like she's considering how you feel because she's just adding to your already heavy load with her own grief.\n\nI had to put down my dog recently. I was devastated. But I cannot imagine in any world going to someone who just lost their husband and father of their children for support with that. \n\nMaybe you could have handled it more tactfully by just saying you can't be her support right now but I don't think you're the asshole here.", "NTA, losing your husband is one of the worst losses you can have in life. I'd say the only thing that truly competes is loosing a child.\n\nHowever, I'll have to fight you. My dog can love me back better then a husband ever could thank you very much. /j", "NTA, but pets do show love and affection in their own way .her pushing her grief and coping isn't good tho. She should understand that both of you are grieving and let that be according to how each wants .", "Nta", "You are not the AH. She can go to the dogs gravesite and deal with her loss however she feels like. \nThe same, you have the right to grieve your own loss as you need to. Let her know (very nicely) that you need your own space for you and your children to grieve their father so you can't go with her to the dog's gravesite. She can always ask her husband to go with her.\n\nI hope that you and your family get the strength and support that you all need. \nMy bestie lost her amazing husband 10 years ago having a young kid to take care of and no. It's not the same as a dog. We still get happy/sad remembering him and telling her son stories about his dad.\n\nMaybe talk to a member of the family (husband?) that could suggest for her to go to grieve counselor because her mourning is getting the best of her and keeping her from reality.", "NTA.\n\nAnd first of all sorry for your loss.   Pets aren't people.  I understand people love their pets immensely, but that fact doesn't change.  You don't commit your life to a pet.  You can't have a two way conversation with a pet.  You can't raise a family with a pet.   There are people in this thread saying YTA for comparing but I mostly just feel sorry for anyone who hasn't loved another human enough to understand the difference between losing a pet and a loved one.  I just lost my dog a couple months ago and I'd had him since he was a few weeks old.  I was completely devastated, but I knew when I got him how long he was expected to live.  People plan their entire lives around marriage.  You can never fully be prepared to lose a partner like that.   \n\nAlso that being said I'm sorry for your sister's loss.  It sounds like she is having g a really tough time and not handling it well.  I hope she's able to lean on her husband some during this time though - I'm assuming he lost the same pet that he loved.  Hopefully you two can get back to a healthy relationship once you've both gotten to a better place.", "NTA. She was incredibly insensitive to your grief. Yes it\u2019s sad that she lost a dog but it\u2019s nowhere near the same as losing your husband and father of your children.", "It's not a competition. I'm gonna go with NAH, grief does fucked up  shit to you. Of course there is no comparison, we enter into a relationship with our dogs knowing that we will outlive them. It sucks, but it's par for the course. You enter into a marriage thinking that you have a partner for most, if not all of your life. I think you should have been less harsh with your sister, on some level she knows that her grief isn't the same, but this is how she is coping. I am sorry for your loss, and hers. I hope that as time passes you can get past this with her, it sounds like you mat need each other.", "NAH\n\nI understand how deeply many dog owners love their dogs, I do. But that doesn't make losing a dog comparable to losing a husband. Not for me, no way.\n\nBut regardless of that, grief isn't a competition. It's a horrible experience that no one chooses to go through, but we all know that the risk of loving is the possibility of losing. It's a hard hard hard thing.\n\nI think though, rather than framing this as being about which loss is greater (even though I agree with you that yours is), it would be more productive to explain that you are both grieving and that you are entitled to process your grief in different ways.\n\nFor her, that may mean visiting her dog's graveside 3 times a day but that isn't what you need and you don't feel that she's respecting your need to grieve in your own way. Her own grief is making her insensitive to how immense the loss that you and your kids are going through really is. \n\nIf you need to, reduce contact for now. That's got to be better than losing your close sibling relationship at such an incredibly hard time. \n\nI'm very very very deeply sorry for your loss.", "NAH\n\nSorry this happened to you. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone here benefits from measuring grief in a hierarchy. Grief is devastating and unique to everyone\u2019s circumstances. It says a lot about you that you were able to acknowledge your sister\u2019s grief and offer support while yours is so fresh. \n\nIt appears your sister hasn\u2019t yet been able to see through her grief enough to recognize how yours (and your children\u2019s) is still in full swing, which makes it fair that you had to set some kind of boundary. While downplaying her grief is not ideal, your grief deserves respect.", "Look I lost my dog of 14 years recently, we did everything together. I have a child who\u2019s 10, I can\u2019t even think of losing them. It would kill me. But my dog was everything. He was with me a quarter of my life. That\u2019s a long fucking time. Grief is grief no matter how you put it. I still miss the shit out of him. I have a shrine next to my bed. I loved that dog! Please try to understand. It hell hard to lose anything. I knew a neighbor who lost his wife of 50 years he had her ring around his neck. He was doing yard work and lost it in the yard. He was devastated had the whole neighborhood looking for this ring day n night. It was so sad to watch him at night looking for it with a flashlight.", "You have every right to grieve in your own way and you can tell other people that you don't want company for it.\n\nBut it was an A-hole move of you to tell her that it's not the same. How dare you classify someone else's grief?! You said that this dog meant the world to her. Also it's not true that a dog can't love someone back. This is actually the biggest bullshit of all the bullshits you wrote in your post.\n\nI'm sorry for your loss. I really do. But YTA. Not for not wanting to go to see the graves 3 times a day with your sister. But for belittling her grief.", "NAH - you both have suffered a great loss. I know it's not comparable, but research has proven that the loss of a pet can be as painful for some people as the loss of a family member. You aren't wrong to tell her that her dog is not the same as your husband, though. Regardless of the grief you are both feeling, you don't have to have your circumstances put down for her.\n\nI do suggest grief therapy for all involved and I'm sorry for your loss.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "NAH but grief is grief.  My husband of 42 years passed away in January, and then I had to have his dog put down in May.  Honestly, both deaths are devastating.  I cry over both of them.  They both loved me.  They were both companions to me.  Anyway, the literature I was given says you can't rank grief, and that suppressing it can make your grieving period longer.  Expecting you to go visit her dog's grave frequently is a bit much IMO.  You have your own things to do, and you have small children who've lost their father.  I'm very sorry for your loss.", "NAH\n\nShe tried to find unity and comfort, you try to manage the pain.\n\nA little harsh from you and a little unsensitive of her.\nNo big issue.\nTell her you are sorry and acted out and it will be OK.", "Ok, I\u2019m leaning towards YTA\u2026and maybe you need to take a step back from your grief. \n\nYour sister *did* suffer a loss. That *was* a member of her family. And I\u2019m sure a bunch of people will come at me because humans and animals are different\u2026but for a lot of people, pets are every bit as important to them as children or spouses. Therefore, the impact TO HER is every bit as much of a gut punch as you losing your husband. \n\nIt\u2019s not a competition. You both experienced a loss, and you\u2019re both dealing with the emotional upheaval that comes with that and figuring out your \u201cnew normal.\u201d I\u2019ve lost human family members and pets - the BOTH hurt just as badly. So stop with the \u201cit\u2019s just a dog\u201d garbage. To her, that dog was family. YTA. \n\nBut, you also have quite a bit on your plate. You lost a husband, which presumably means that (aside from companionship) you also lost and income stream and a partner in parenting to your children. Plus your kids are grieving too. You\u2019ve got a lot on your plate with figuring what your family life is like now and how it all works, in addition to the heartache. So\u2026perhaps she shouldn\u2019t be dragging you to cemeteries and whatnot. Honestly though\u2026it sounds like she\u2019s looking for some support, and since she sees you as suffering a loss too, she thinks you could lean on each other to get through it. I think a heart to heart conversation with her about your challenges and how her actions make you feel might go a long way\u2026and I think you two could actually be great support once you work out what that looks like. The ones who understand grief best are the ones also grieving.", "YTA grief is grief. It\u2019s not a competition.", "Ur mad at her for the same thing YOU are doing- comparing despair. It sounds like projection. Expressing frustration for not respecting ur grieving process is fine but everything else is out of pocket.

Funny how some baboons here call you YTA, who compares the loss of a pet with a husband/father/grandfather etc etc etc? It makes 0 sense. Obviously losing your husband is 1000x times worse than your sister losing her dear dog.", "I didn't even think of the fact she had her husband to turn to. Wow, I feel stupid now.

Maybe just take a break from talking or hanging out with her for a couple weeks.

Everyone has their own journey and their own process, and for your sister it's super fresh. \n\nThe issue is she's trying to drag you into it, and is putting her needs above yours in this. She knows how difficult visiting the grave is for you but is pushing it. She knows you have two young children at home who are also dealing with losing their dad yet she wants so much of your time when you need to be with them. \n\nBut.... you're both grieving... not the same level of loss, but the brain doesn't really tier out trauma or trauma response so in this moment things are very touchy. You were right to draw a line to protect yourself.

You are losing a partner who helped you around the house, helped you with errands, helped with the kids. You have lost someone you have built a life with, who you pictured growing old together.

This is yours.\"", "NAH. \n\nIt sounds like your sister is genuinely trying to connect with you through a shared time of grief in your lives, which is fine; but it\u2019s not working for you and only making yours worse, which is also fine. It\u2019s one thing to acknowledge you\u2019re both grieving someone who was important to you, but comparing grief is a losing game for everyone and your sister shouldn\u2019t be forcing her comparisons on you when it\u2019s definitely not how you view it.\n\nThis is hard because I get where your sister\u2019s grief is coming from. As someone with zero plans to marry or have children, other than when I lose my parents and if my sibling goes before me, I know that when the day comes that I lose the dog who saved my life when I was in a deep depression it will be one of the hardest things I ever through. Just typing that has me in tears because that dog is my family and I love him with all of my heart. That said, I do personally agree with you that it\u2019s not the same as- especially prematurely as it sounds here- losing the person you were supposed to have a whole life with. I think if you can have a gentle conversation with your sister where you tell her you need a break from talking about your losses, that might be everyone\u2019s best longterm interests. You don\u2019t want to discount or dismiss her grief, but it sounds like you\u2019re feeling like yours is being cheapened as it stands; and that\u2019s not ok either. If she refuses to stop talking to you about it and insists on continuing to say it\u2019s the same to her after that, well then Y W N T A for continuing to tell her to stop. \n\nAlso, side note for what it\u2019s worth; I take a anti-anxiety medication as needed, and as it absolutely messes with my emotions. For me, it\u2019s numbness, then a few hours of extreme irritability as it wears off. I\u2019m not a medical professional, but if you\u2019re worried about why your empathy and emotional reading skills are off, talk to yours and can tell you if the medication your on is the likely culprit.", "NTA. I get that losing a pet is hard, been there, done that.  But to compare losing a pet to losing a husband is over the top. \n\nYou did nothing wrong. I am so sorry for your loss.", "NTA - Every loss impacts us all differently. I\u2019ve loved all my animals, they\u2019re family and it always hurts so much.. I lost 5 members of my family in a few months, one specific uncles death pushed me over the edge. Then last year, in November, I lost my baby. I had always thought the pain of such a thing must be the worst thing in the world, but until you go through it, you can\u2019t even get close to understanding the pain of it. \n\nI understand your sister is grieving, but she\u2019s TA for comparing grief\u2026 I imagine you bit your tongue until it became unbearable, I don\u2019t think your TA for that.", "NTA, don't get me wrong I couldn't imagine losing my dog and no I would be awful but losing my husband I'm assuming would be soul destroying.\nThe two should never be compared and she needs to understand that.\nNot only are you grieving but your also grieving for your children and trying to be there for them.\nJust being there for your sister once or twice was long enough and so supportive with what your going through. Now maybe take some space away from her", "NTA\n\nThis isn't comparable. Losing a pet is not the same as losing a spouse.\n\nI mean, ok, both are much loved members of a family, but at the end of the day the loss of a spouse has much greater impact and repercussions.", "Really hate replying to this but, today people are bred too and taught too melt for everything and anything. \nThis is a pure result of today's society.  My neighbors daughter had a complete meltdown due too a squishy that the dog chewed up. She is 18 and dressed in black for a week it's been 3 months, lost her menial job  using it as an excuse and received time off for it. But it is what broke her. Buying a new one did not or was unable to replace the one she lost. \nSo here it is. Keep voting the way you vote and you get what you deserve. \nIt's all connected. Put your sister in a home she will not survive the coming apocalypse.", "NTA! \n\nSure, losing a well loved pet hurts. It is definitely not the same as losing the person who was your partner, lover, friend, father to your children, co-provider, and confidant!\n\nShe should know better and be offering to help you in whatever capacity she is able, rather than to go visit her dog's grave 3 times a week. That is definitely selfish and self-centered on her part!", "I believe grief is grief and deeply personal.  Grieving a pet or person is still Grieving.  A little empathy goes a long way and negating another's grief is always an AH move.  Perhaps just say \"I don't want to be sad...let's talk about something else \" or find another way to deflect.  You both lost a beloved companion...it IS a good time to share your grief and strengthen your relationship unless you want to \"win\" more than you want a sister.", "People...I'm like in my 40's...how is that young...again I stand by what I say", "NTA.

As some have said, there are people who love their dogs this much, and it's not ok to gatekeep grief.  But to actually verbalize her feelings that the loss is comprable is batshit territory.

I love m\u2019y dog more than anything, but the grief of losing a pet will never compare to the grief of losing a partner. All the people in our lives have roles and it\u2019s awful to lose anyone, but dogs don\u2019t live forever, so unless someone has underlying reasons for being extremely attached e.g. is lonely, never had kids, etc, it\u2019s not healthy to have this extreme a reaction, and it\u2019s thoughtless to think the two types of grief compare. My guess is she\u2019s either trying to steal the focus and is jealous you\u2019re getting more attention, or there\u2019s something else causing her to get this upset and the dog had higher significance than just a pet, and she\u2019s having a mental health spiral. Doesn\u2019t excuse her behaviour whatsoever though. My advice would just be to stay away but also be civil. If she\u2019s acting like this there can\u2019t be much reasoning with her. Nobody with an ounce of compassion would be that cruel to a grieving widow", "I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re necessarily wrong in your comment, however maybe you should\u2019ve just told her that now isn\u2019t the right time, and that your mourning process is different than hers. Grieving someone important in your life feels different to everyone, some can handle it better than other, while some like your sister can\u2019t really understand why her grief isn\u2019t prioritized by everyone. Ultimately I believe you\u2019re NTA, but maybe a little bit of distance between you and your sister, resulting from your comment, will help both of you", "Oh dear.that's a tough one.

It\u2019s not comparable to children losing a parent - been through that myself.", "This - my stepmum died two years ago and my stepsister had a hard time understanding that not everyone grieved like she did, she was driving 3 hour round trip weekly to visit the grave, sleeping with a picture of her mum etc, none of which is wrong but she was trying to push her sister and me into joining her and losing it when we didn\u2019t. I didn\u2019t grow up with her so of course my relationship to her is different but she couldn\u2019t understand it", ">you can't necessarily compare grief\n\nI think this is it for me. She seems to believe that because she's lost a (obviously very loved) dog she understands your grief fully. Which she doesn't. \n\nI get it, she wants comfort, but it seems like all the comfort she's getting from sharing whatever grief they both have is actually just compounding and worsening OP's grief, and the sister doesn't seem to realise that.", "This is it.

But one person\u2019s grief wasn\u2019t bigger or more important than the other person\u2019s. And I think having that understanding helped us to support each other in a way.

Either way it's fine you told her what you did, but now there should me a moment where you guys talk about this, and where she understand her comparing your situations is not appropriate.", "Grief - any kind of grief - can hit us in unexpected ways.  I see some folks saying that OPs sister is clearly a narcissist or she's doing this for attention, but we don't have nearly enough information (imo) to draw those kinds of conclusions.  She may genuinely feel her world falling apart and be suffering from anxiety, depression and who knows what else in the same way that OP is. \n\nNo, I don't think a husband is equivalent to a dog, and I think in time the pain of losing an animal (even unexpectedly losing the most beloved animal of all time) is going to fade moreso than the loss of a spouse.  But right now that wound is raw and fresh and you gotta cope with it any way that you can - and you gotta set boundaries to avoid the things that don't help.  \n\nSo OP is learning that her boundaries are going to include not visiting graves 3x a day.

To give yourself permission to just enjoy a sunrise, eat a froyo, laugh at a joke, and not be sad at that moment. To let other feelings exist. And if you can do it once, you can do it again.  And someday, you might find that waking up hurts just a little bit less than it did yesterday.\n\n@OP:  Pain is real, even when it's illogical.

I assumed that my cat would live somewhere between 15-20 years in age, and when she reached the end of her life, I had anticipated it. And honestly, as much as I loved her, she was a cat, not a human. I got over her death pretty quickly. Sometimes, I sigh and say \"I miss Mimi,\" and my husband goes \"yeah,\" and we go on with our day.\n\nNobody is emotionally prepared to lose a husband suddenly at an age where they still have small children at home. Frankly, attempting to compare the loss of a pet to the unexpected loss of a spouse is offensive.", "I really like dogs and see this is insane. Yeah we do burials but a wake and going to visit a grave 3 times a day. A cat I had since childhood and protected me against my abuser died a few weeks ago and I\u2019ve gone to his grave like 3 or 4 times in a few week. OP\u2019s sister is really freaking weird", "Really wish people would stop throwing around diagnoses on Reddit like this.

Narcs don't care if the person is faking it or not either they just want the attention.  \n\n\nPeople can really like dogs...that doesn't mean they lose a part of their humanity and ability to measure a situation.

I don't really care how hard people want to grieve their dog or hamster or whatever. The only time comparison comes in is when the person grieving is leaning on someone with an objectively worse situation/trying to pretend they are the same and I think that's what annoyed me in this situation. \n\nSociety does not and will never accept someone who is dealing with a dead dog leaning on someone whose husband has just died for support and acting like they are equivalents. In the same way I wouldn't moan about sleepless baby nights to someone dealing with infertility. I wouldn't moan about my headache to someone with brain cancer. It isn't that the dead dog, the sleep deprivation or the headache aren't genuinely negative or even traumatising experiences to the person experiencing them. It is that it is so inappropriate to burden people with much more significant ills with your own less significant ills. I think anyone with a modicum of common sense would recognise that there is inherent hierarchy of grief/pain/sadness/etc. Especially when they are directly connected issues. It's callous and rude to lean on people in worse situations than you. Find someone else! \n\nIf the person you are complaining to would give their left arm to be in your situation instead of theirs, you are leaning on the wrong person.", "I\u2019m a craziest of all the crazy dog people out there. I lost my 16yo dog 4 years ago and I still miss him every day. And I 100% do not agree with you. Dog owners enter into the relationship expecting they\u2019ll have 10-15 years of love. Spouses enter into the relationship expecting a lifetime. A dog\u2019s companionship, while wonderful, is no where near the same as that of a spouse. Dog owners who thinks losing their pet is the same as losing a spouse are absolutely unhinged.", "Are you being serious right now?

Even ten years.  Someone dying after a long and happy life is sad, because you miss them, but it's not a tragedy.  I have been more sad about my cats dying than I was about my grandparents dying - I had all of them until I was forty years old, and still have one of 'em, and they all died at well over eighty years old, and had funerals where dozens of people came to say how much they loved them and what good people they were and how much good they did in the world.  No matter how sad you are, that's not a tragedy.  \n\nHeck, my Papa Ralph died at the age of ninety-five, of nothing in particular other than being old, in no significant pain, having been healthy enough to eating steak and drink beer just  six months before his death, in his own bed, in the house he built personally, in which he raised four kids, with the woman he'd loved for near eighty years, since high school, holding his hand, and then over two hundred people came through the open house Nana had to tell her just how much he meant to them.  He had given a LOT of young men their first job, and over a dozen of them said that he was the first actually healthy male role model they had, and they modeled their successful lives after him.  The open house was catered, and hundreds of people had sandwiches and drank beer and it was basically a party.  Not a wild one, but people were genuinely having a good time seeing people they hadn't seen in a long time.\n\nWere my father and grandmother a mess for a couple days? Of course.  Was it a tragedy?  Not in the least - that is an S-tier victory in life.  \n\nIn any case... I would bet five bucks that the lady was also delayed-grieving for her mother when she was grieving her cat.
