I was trying to bake a pie, for the second time ever (homemade). I know that when you make pie, you're supposed to let them set. (Last time I didn't, and the pie fell apart.)\n\nSo when my pie got done baking, I hid it so my mom wouldn't eat it. I let it set for 2 hours. During the 2 hours, she kept making my sister ask me where the pie was. And apparently, she was turning the kitchen upside down looking for it. She she went to me myself to ask where it was. I told her I was letting set so it wouldn't fall apart. She eventually left. \n\nI had hid my pie in my room, and my room is connected to a porch by a window. I walked outside, made a loop around my house and then walked to the porch and grabbed the pie from the window, and brought it in that way. (To keep my hiding place unknown) When I finally brought the pie out, she said she didn't want any my \"damn pie\" and that I was \"pulling a grandma.\" (Her mother was abusive) She was yelling at me how she wouldn't hide food from me, etc. I tried to tell her I just wanted to let the pie set, and she just yelled, \"You don't have to let a pie set. You can eat it straight from the oven.\" (Paraphrasing here.)\n\nMy sister started to say that my mom hid food from us all the time (hiding candy, etc.) so she can't say she wouldn't do that to me. Then I tried to hand my mom a slice of pie, and she threw it on the table and left. My sister told me I didn't do anything wrong, and most people wouldn't care. But I don't know if she's right.\nI can't leave my room without my mom glaring at me. She also thinks animals got to the pie (She tells every person who tries to get a slice), and I won't correct her because I don't want to reveal my hiding place.

Second, its your pie, you put the work in to make it, and its your decision on when to serve/share it with your family.\n\nThe only reason you had to hide it is because your mom felt entitled to it and was actively trying to eat it before it was ready, which would have made your whole pie run out and collapse.

Her behavior is not normal nor is her reaction. If your mom\u2019s anything like mine, she\u2019ll never go to therapy. Best plan of action is to go to therapy yourself to learn appropriate communication skills since it seems it\u2019s not being taught in your home.

Mom is 100000% the asshole for putting her trauma/over dramatic bullshit/narcissism on OP. OP is 16 and literally has to hide a pie from their mother.

It's just weird how she doesn't seem to notice how her actions might affect others, especially her own children. \n\nYou worked hard for that pie, you wanted it to be done right, you wanted to try a new method with letting it set. But she made it about her and how her mother treated her. Instead of seeing it about her daughter putting her skills to the test and wanting things to be done right. \n\nThe real issue lies just with your mom;i dont see how you did anything wrong. Sooooo many people go on in life with just sweeping their trauma under the rug and pretending they're okay, but then the trauma comes up in innocent moments like this. I'm sure your mom has talked about her trauma but not with a therapist I'm guessing. \n\nI'll be honest, I wouldn't know how to approach this subject if I were you and 16 living under her rules. You know your mom best. Not saying she's a bad person, just someone with childhood trauma who might cope with food and lashing out on others and victimizing herself. I know you love your mom, so what do you think would be the best way to get her to see your point of view? Ask her if she really sees you just like her mom, and if she answers yes, let her know how that is more upsetting than having to wait 2 hours to eat pie....tell her you feel like she's using her undealt with childhood trauma as emotional blackmail on you and you feel like she's putting 1 wedge between you two over HAVING TO WAIT 2 HOURS TO EAT A PIE.....in the least condescending tone possible.

You're well within your rights to let your pie set! It's not going to mold and become inedible in two hours. \n\nHowever, I'm going to provide a piece of possible context: My grandmother grew up during the Great Depression and dealt with a lot of food insecurity. She often had to hide food or eat anything she had immediately, even if she wasn't hungry, just so her siblings wouldn't steal and eat it (because they were also hungry children!) This manifested later in life as a habit of eating everything immediately and never leaving leftovers - she would make a whole tray of fudge and then eat it all in one go, because subconsciously she couldn't believe it would be there later.\n It sounds like your mom's experiences with her mother have provided a similar catalyst for weird food behaviors in her adulthood. This is an explanation and not an excuse, though; compulsion or no, she doesn't have to liken you to her shitty mom, yell at you for not wanting your pie to get obliterated, or slander the pie's safety and hygiene (???) in revenge. She needs to acknowledge that she has a lot of issues with food and work on them instead of marinating in shame and lashing out at people who just don't want their damn pie eaten before its time.", "NTA\n\nYour mother\u2019s behavior is not normal. It probably is related to her mother\u2019s abusive behavior, but that\u2019s a reason that allows for understanding to work towards addressing a behavior - it does not give her a pass to treat you like this.\n\nIt is not normal to not be able to wait until food is ready to be served (as long as other snacks/food are readily available so a person isn\u2019t hungry.) It is not normal to turn a room upside down looking for a food item that you have been told is not ready yet, but will be ready in two hours. (And yes, Pie needs to rest after baking.)\n\nIt\u2019s REALLY not okay to accuse you of being abusive to your mom with food. Waiting for food to finish resting is not abuse. You are the child here, you are not controlling her food access - she can go out and get her own pie.\n\nYour mom has a problem, but she may not be able to see it - so I really encourage you to consider speaking to a nutritionist and therapist when you can (which may not be until you are an adult) so you don\u2019t accidentally replicate some of these same unhealthy behaviors forward.\n\nThen tossing the pie down, telling everyone else animals got to it - it\u2019s weird. \n\nMore pie for you I guess. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t reveal your hiding place either - people either trust you or they don\u2019t.
