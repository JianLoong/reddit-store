Her behavior is not normal nor is her reaction. If your mom\u2019s anything like mine, she\u2019ll never go to therapy. Best plan of action is to go to therapy yourself to learn appropriate communication skills since it seems it\u2019s not being taught in your home.

Sooooo many people go on in life with just sweeping their trauma under the rug and pretending they're okay, but then the trauma comes up in innocent moments like this. I'm sure your mom has talked about her trauma but not with a therapist I'm guessing. \n\nI'll be honest, I wouldn't know how to approach this subject if I were you and 16 living under her rules. You know your mom best. Not saying she's a bad person, just someone with childhood trauma who might cope with food and lashing out on others and victimizing herself. I know you love your mom, so what do you think would be the best way to get her to see your point of view?

You're well within your rights to let your pie set! It's not going to mold and become inedible in two hours. \n\nHowever, I'm going to provide a piece of possible context: My grandmother grew up during the Great Depression and dealt with a lot of food insecurity. She often had to hide food or eat anything she had immediately, even if she wasn't hungry, just so her siblings wouldn't steal and eat it (because they were also hungry children!) This manifested later in life as a habit of eating everything immediately and never leaving leftovers - she would make a whole tray of fudge and then eat it all in one go, because subconsciously she couldn't believe it would be there later.\n It sounds like your mom's experiences with her mother have provided a similar catalyst for weird food behaviors in her adulthood. This is an explanation and not an excuse, though; compulsion or no, she doesn't have to liken you to her shitty mom, yell at you for not wanting your pie to get obliterated, or slander the pie's safety and hygiene (???) in revenge. She needs to acknowledge that she has a lot of issues with food and work on them instead of marinating in shame and lashing out at people who just don't want their damn pie eaten before its time.", "NTA\n\nYour mother\u2019s behavior is not normal. It probably is related to her mother\u2019s abusive behavior, but that\u2019s a reason that allows for understanding to work towards addressing a behavior - it does not give her a pass to treat you like this.\n\nIt is not normal to not be able to wait until food is ready to be served (as long as other snacks/food are readily available so a person isn\u2019t hungry.) It is not normal to turn a room upside down looking for a food item that you have been told is not ready yet, but will be ready in two hours. (And yes, Pie needs to rest after baking.)\n\nIt\u2019s REALLY not okay to accuse you of being abusive to your mom with food. Waiting for food to finish resting is not abuse. You are the child here, you are not controlling her food access - she can go out and get her own pie.\n\nYour mom has a problem, but she may not be able to see it - so I really encourage you to consider speaking to a nutritionist and therapist when you can (which may not be until you are an adult) so you don\u2019t accidentally replicate some of these same unhealthy behaviors forward.\n\nThen tossing the pie down, telling everyone else animals got to it - it\u2019s weird. \n\nMore pie for you I guess. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t reveal your hiding place either - people either trust you or they don\u2019t.

It seems to be a symptom of the abuse she received herself, but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not emotionally abusing her child due to her own unresolved trauma", "How would you describe first being sulking and accusing, by bending what really happened, and then trying to prevent others from having a slice of pie with lies, as form of punishment? \n\nGaslighting is the word that comes to mind \ud83e\udd14", "Both can be true. Mom is the asshole and could also have an eating disorder brought about by her own abusive mother. It\u2019s a cycle.", "True but there's a difference in saying that one is abusive and one is abusive because they have received it", "NTA and your mom turned into the abuser, not you", "Your mother is psychotic.", "NTA. Your mom is unhinged and sounds crazy.", "NTA - seems like her mom passed on a bad relationship with food by withholding it from your mom. Now your mom is compensating by going for it ASAP.", "NTA sounds like grandma isn't the only abusive parent in this story. It's not normal to be this obsessed with food. It's also not normal to punish and degrade your children over a disagreement.", "NTA and your mom seems mentally troubled. Do not feel guilty she is the one in the wrong for punishing you for her unresolved trauma.", "NTA she is mean and abusive and greedy", "NTA. Your mom needs therapy. She obviously has an issue with food, and if she said you\u2019re acting like her mother I can take a wild guess and imagine she had a mother that heavily controlled her access to food. Either way you\u2019re the kid and that\u2019s not your problem and mom needs to get her shit together.\n\nFor your own sanity, here\u2019s a possible explanation for her actions. Her acting out like a child after discovering you hid the pie can be a combination of a lot of emotional dysregulation here, these are all extremely illogical and not okay but exist nonetheless. \n\n1 - she asked many times and no one told her, so she likely feels like everyone is plotting against her and keeping secrets from her\n\n2 - she is likely acting like a child and making this a big deal bc she is likely re experiencing the times where food was restricted from her and the unprocessed trauma from that\n\n3 - she is embarrassed by emotions 1 & 2 being perceived to the point that you had to do so much to hide this from her. \n\n4 - because of all of these negative emotions that humiliating to experience, she feels u are humiliating her on purpose and is thus lashing out at you and your pie\n\n5 - bc she can\u2019t face the fact that she is doing all of this simultaneously, she is projecting all of this onto the world around her, and you are the easiest target\n\nI\u2019m sure this is all quite unintentional and likely she has absolutely no idea what she is doing. So I hope you don\u2019t take this as a reflection of her feelings towards you. Nonetheless she needs to figure this shit out and hopefully u can come out unscathed. I was raised by this type of mom and I deal with the emotional side effects every day even 5 years after I moved out.", "NTA.  Your mother has an eating disorder.  Also, it seriously makes me wonder if Grandma was actually abusive, or if she resorted to hiding food because mom was so greedy that she ate everything before anyone could ever get any.", "NTA. Buy your mom is actually abusive to both you and your sister. I\u2019m sure this isn\u2019t the first time. It\u2019s emotional and psychological abuse please go to someone about this. Because it\u2019s not good for either or you to have to deal with someone like this blood related or not. Please tell someone that can help you.", "NTA\n\nYou've saved your pie from roving brigands and ne'er-do-wells - congrats!", "NTA. Pies definitely need time to set.", "Molten pie is a great band name.", "Wow. Cake is a trigger for me too. I would have ripped it from her hands after calling her out on ruining my dad\u2019s birthday.", "Here\u2019s the thing. You can be unwell and still be the asshole. Everyone has tragic backstories for when they do shitty things bc trauma usually causes maladaptive and selfish behaviors for self preservation. At the end of the day you are in control of your actions. Mom can receive both sympathy for her trauma & acknowledgment for being an asshole with her actions. They are not mutually exclusive.\n\nI say this as someone who literally has BPD, which if you know anything about it it is literally a disorder caused by severe childhood emotional neglect and abuse that - you guessed it - causes me to have erratic behavior, manipulative (though not malicious) tendencies, and extreme emotional selfishness when I am unmanaged & dysregulated. Yea I have the trauma to explain why these compulsions exist, but it\u2019s entirely on me to make decisions to fix these things. And I am definitely the asshole when I do bad things to others, despite how much one could justify why I do what I do. It has taken a lot of therapy & self reflection to get to this point of understanding this idea.", "Hand her a bag of flour mixed with sugar?", "i think food trauma for sure. sounds like her own mother restricted, withheld, or controlled her access to food as a child. Her comparing OP to her mother is a very telling sign. I sympathize with mama\u2019s trauma but i don\u2019t excuse the behaviors she exists when dealing with it. OP\u2019s emotional needs will always trump that of her literal mother & caretaker. This is how trauma is passed down.", "I know you said grandma was abusive, but I think your mum is too. She's going mental about not getting to eat something that wasn't done yet, has said how many horrible things to you, insulted the pie, been emotionally manipulative... and all of it over a $#@%ing pie. Honey, that is unhinged. \n\nThose of us who have suffered abuse will sometimes mention a 'normal meter'... how good are you at telling when something is normal vs abusive? If you think your mother's behavior is normal and not abusive, it sounds like your normal meter might need a tune-up, too. Her behavior is awful, and not okay.", "Yea I agree. I sympathize for the fact that mom isn\u2019t trying to give OP a hard time, but rather is having a hard time. However that is also how i describe how toddlers experience emotional dysregulation and not entire ass parents to children who simply need them to be better. Everyone has reasons & tragic backstories to explain why they do shitty things. Doesn\u2019t change the reality that she is a mother with a child whose needs trump that of her own.", "I\u2019m aware it\u2019s a cycle. I thought I clearly said that mom clearly had her own trauma, but it doesn\u2019t absolve her of dealing with it and not continuing the cycle with her own kids. She\u2019s unequivocally the asshole here. \n\nWhat I was commenting on is that OP is at no way at fault or is op an asshole in any way. I\u2019m honestly not sure how the person I responded to thinks op is the asshole.", "Yup, literally every abused child, once they grow up, can see the trauma their parents went through. They can also see they are damaged people, who never dealt with their trauma, and just put it on their kid/kids. Doesn\u2019t absolve them of abusing their children.", "There\u2019s not though. The cause of the mother being abusive doesn\u2019t at all change the fact that she is abusing her child. It\u2019s the same as saying that it\u2019s different when someone that was bullied became a bully. It doesn\u2019t change the harm that\u2019s being passed on. You literally said that she wasn\u2019t abusing anyone. But she literally is. Explanation is not justification. And I have plenty of times that that phrase applies to myself. I have anger issues that I actually can\u2019t control without a mood stabilizer (luckily I don\u2019t lash out physically but I can get pretty mean sometimes which is also very very bad) so that\u2019s not just an empty phrase to me. Having a reason to behave a certain way, doesn\u2019t change the fact that you are behaving that way and that it is up to you to make the necessary changes to not pass that on", "exactly. Luckily my own mom has been able to at the very least accept the fact that something had to have gone wrong in their parenting for me to end up with a disorder that is literally caused by severe childhood emotional neglect. took my parents a beat to accept my diagnosis bc it would mean accepting that they were a large part of causing it, but they have made a lot of grounds and been extremely supportive since. frankly if they hadn\u2019t i would have gone no/little contact and i made that explicitly clear early on."]}
