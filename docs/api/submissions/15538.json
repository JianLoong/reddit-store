Doesn't matter if it's for anything or for anyone, etc.\n\n So me (16F) my mom (51F) and my sister (19F) were in the kitchen this morning. I was trying to bake a pie, for the second time ever (homemade). I know that when you make pie, you're supposed to let them set. (Last time I didn't, and the pie fell apart.)\n\nSo when my pie got done baking, I hid it so my mom wouldn't eat it. I let it set for 2 hours. During the 2 hours, she kept making my sister ask me where the pie was. And apparently, she was turning the kitchen upside down looking for it. She she went to me myself to ask where it was. I told her I was letting set so it wouldn't fall apart. She eventually left. \n\nI had hid my pie in my room, and my room is connected to a porch by a window. I walked outside, made a loop around my house and then walked to the porch and grabbed the pie from the window, and brought it in that way. (To keep my hiding place unknown) When I finally brought the pie out, she said she didn't want any my \"damn pie\" and that I was \"pulling a grandma.\" (Her mother was abusive) She was yelling at me how she wouldn't hide food from me, etc. I tried to tell her I just wanted to let the pie set, and she just yelled, \"You don't have to let a pie set. You can eat it straight from the oven.\" (Paraphrasing here.)\n\nMy sister started to say that my mom hid food from us all the time (hiding candy, etc.) so she can't say she wouldn't do that to me. Then I tried to hand my mom a slice of pie, and she threw it on the table and left. My sister told me I didn't do anything wrong, and most people wouldn't care. But I don't know if she's right.\nI can't leave my room without my mom glaring at me. She also thinks animals got to the pie (She tells every person who tries to get a slice), and I won't correct her because I don't want to reveal my hiding place. Am I the asshole?\n\ntldr, I got yelled at for not letting my mom eat my pie right away.", "created_utc": 1682287013, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12wrqe4/aita_for_hiding_my_pie_for_2_hours_to_let_it_set/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Also, I just learned why my pies always turn out runny.", "NTA\n\nYour mom has a big problem with food. That is not your fault.\nYou had to resort to hiding a pie for 2 hours so she would leave it alone and then she threw a fit. That is not normal.\n\nYes you absolutely should let a pie cool for awhile before eating it. Eating it straight from the oven could cause burns as well as the pie being runny. I have seen someone get burned by molten pie.", "NTA\n\nMost pies do need to set. What kind of pie did you make? How did it turn out?\n\nWere you using cornstarch, gelatin, or pectin as a thickener/stabilizer? Any one of those things needs to come back down to temp to properly set otherwise its usually pure liquid when you try to cut into it and take a slice out. Apple pie is probably the most stable kind of pie, and most likely to be able to cut into fairly soon out of the oven, but letting it cool down and set generally always be better\n\nYour mom is being an asshole. First, she isn't even entitled to the pie if you made it, it might have been for your friends or school or whatever else. Second, its your pie, you put the work in to make it, and its your decision on when to serve/share it with your family.\n\nThe only reason you had to hide it is because your mom felt entitled to it and was actively trying to eat it before it was ready, which would have made your whole pie run out and collapse. If your mother had self control and respect for your work then you wouldn't have had to hide it from her. She is supposed to be the adult, but she isn't acting like one.", "NTA your mom\u2019s reaction seems quite extreme.

As a baker, wanting things to come out the intended way and not pigging out the moment it comes out of the oven is TOTALLY normal. I threaten them with a beating with a spatula.

No adult should throw a temper tantrum because they have to wait to eat something.", "NTA. I think your mother has an addiction to sweets and needs to have these issues addressed by a therapist, instead of her 51 yr old grown self taking out her childhood mother/daughter issues out on you. Not trying to exaggerate, I really think she has an addiction to food or sweets and it needs to be addressed because no one with a healthy relationship with food would throw a tantrum over having to wait 2 hours to eat pie. Her actions remind me of my alcoholic father. \n\nMaybe next time, buy a pre-made pie so she can eat it while you let your homemade pie set? I have no real good advice, just good luck", "NTA!\n\nNot a baker, and no idea if pies need time to set. You know, it doesn't matter!  You were the one baking, you wanted to let it set, and your mom needed to respect your wishes.  Your mom clearly has food issues, but more importantly, she has problems respecting you and your sister's wishes.  Her reaction here is over the top.", "NTA but I think your mother has gone through some trauma and never properly dealt with it. I think you underestimate how unwell she really is.", "I'm gonna say NTA.

And some pies do have to set, depending on what kind they are, some even need to set in the fridge.", "NTA and your mom is being just as abusive as her mom was to her.

It sounds from what you have said that your Mum has an eating disorder (possibly from her abusive mother withholding/ hiding food, based on what you have written). I'm sorry that you have to deal with that and it's a recurrent problem. \n\nIt sounds like your Mum is unwell and I'm going to go with NAH because that is not normal or healthy behaviour.

My mother has compared me to her abusive mother all my life. Her mother that died 10 years before I was born. And only when she thinks I\u2019ve been mean to her and that\u2019s usually when I create a boundary or stand up for myself. \n\nI\u2019m willing to bet your mother does passive aggressive things towards you often. Her behavior is not normal nor is her reaction. If your mom\u2019s anything like mine, she\u2019ll never go to therapy. Best plan of action is to go to therapy yourself to learn appropriate communication skills since it seems it\u2019s not being taught in your home. You\u2019re obviously NTA but going to therapy could help you spot her abusive behaviors and give yourself confidence to know when you\u2019re being manipulated.", "NTA.

For example, I'll get a party size bag of potato chips to pack for school lunches, and she'll take the bag and eat most, if not the whole thing, in one sitting. And when I get upset, she goes on a rant about how she bought it and therefore can eat the entire thing if she wants.", "Respectfully disagree. Mom is 100000% the asshole for putting her trauma/over dramatic bullshit/narcissism on OP. OP is 16 and literally has to hide a pie from their mother. Plus, if mom has this much of an obsession with a pie, I am going to take a not so wild leap, and suspect she is causing op to have their own trauma.

You are NTA", "I think maybe some of the other commenters are right to suggest she has an unhealthy relationship with food then, especially as she compared you to her abusive mother. If you feel you could, it would be worth trying to discuss this with her when things calm down.", "I get that part, if it was like a roommate situation but you're her daughter so doesn't she know that's why you chose the chips is for school lunches? It's just weird how she doesn't seem to notice how her actions might affect others, especially her own children. \n\nYou worked hard for that pie, you wanted it to be done right, you wanted to try a new method with letting it set. But she made it about her and how her mother treated her. Instead of seeing it about her daughter putting her skills to the test and wanting things to be done right. \n\nThe real issue lies just with your mom;i dont see how you did anything wrong. Sooooo many people go on in life with just sweeping their trauma under the rug and pretending they're okay, but then the trauma comes up in innocent moments like this. I'm sure your mom has talked about her trauma but not with a therapist I'm guessing. \n\nI'll be honest, I wouldn't know how to approach this subject if I were you and 16 living under her rules. You know your mom best. Not saying she's a bad person, just someone with childhood trauma who might cope with food and lashing out on others and victimizing herself. I know you love your mom, so what do you think would be the best way to get her to see your point of view? Ask her if she really sees you just like her mom, and if she answers yes, let her know how that is more upsetting than having to wait 2 hours to eat pie....tell her you feel like she's using her undealt with childhood trauma as emotional blackmail on you and you feel like she's putting 1 wedge between you two over HAVING TO WAIT 2 HOURS TO EAT A PIE.....in the least condescending tone possible.
