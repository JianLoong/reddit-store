Throughout I told my mum that it would not be a good decision having my nan at our house. My mum works 12 hour work days 7 days a week. We also have chickens and a very high maintenance kitten that take time too. I didn\u2019t believe that she would have the capability of providing adequate care. \n\nMy grandma arrived at our home 4 days ago and it has been a mess. It is clear to me that her dementia has deteriorated since I saw her last. She is fully incontinent, her working memory is extremely poor - possibly 3-5 minutes, she cannot be left alone longer than maybe 20 minutes as she becomes anxious, she is not orientated to time or place. Some examples are she thinks we are in her old house that she moved away from 15 years ago, thinks her mum who died in 2008 is alive, thinks I am a young child although i\u2019m 21 etc. She cannot cook and struggles to feed herself, and she has been eating raw food from the fridge. She also refuses treatment and medication, and doesn\u2019t know/admit that she has dementia. In addition to the dementia, her OCD is extremely severe resulting in difficulties eating, drinking, dressing, going outside etc. She is very difficult to manage and presents a serious health risk to herself and us. I do not feel safe in her presence due to her aggressive behaviour. \n\nAdditionally, my nan now believes that she is in her own home, and has been hiding our things, including our keys so I couldn\u2019t get in the garden to feed the chicks. When we needed to check her bags for the hidden items she became so distressed and behaved aggressively to the point I almost called the police to ensure our safety. \n\nThroughout this time my nan has also been expressing severe distress due to my kitten. We have explained he is clean but she remains averse to him and is not safe to be around him. I have barricaded us both in my room but she is still really distressed about his presence in the house. My mum says I am being dramatic and that when I go back to uni we will just have to lock the kitten in my bedroom all day while she is at work. I have told my mum and uncle that I need her out of the house and in a care facility urgently. They both have refused and told me that I am selfish and crazy. They want her to remain at home because they think she will be abused despite me working in a care home and telling them it\u2019s ok. \n\nAm I the asshole for wanting my nan gone? I just want my kitten to be safe, and my nan taken care of and safe in a facility especially as there is no prospect of home care any time soon.

If so, I would sit your mom down and tell her that you\u2019re thinking of moving because you are not prepared to be a surrogate nurse for your Nan.", "NTA, at the condition it sounds like she's in now she requires full time care, which you cannot provide and your mother is not doing those tasks. The best place would be in a car facility trained to deal with dementia, but make sure you visit cause it could help in the long run.", "As someone who also had a nana with bad dementia, so bad that she thought I was my dad when I visit, no, you aren't at all.\n\nShe should be in care home with nurses that can watch her 24/7 and give her the care and attention that she needs. She will be much better off.", "NTA - she obviously needs around the clock care. If I am understanding right you are going back to university soonish and your mother\u2019s plan is to leave her alone 13 hours a day 7 days a week. Depending on where you live this alone could be elder abuse. It\u2019s also a dumb plan that will likely lead to the house burned down and your grandmother dead.", "Absolutely not the asshole, all signs your nan is showing point to needing to be put into care immediately so she can be taken care of properly especially if there's no one there 24/7 to provide the care she needs. \n\nI'm sorry to hear you're having to go through this, Dementia is a cruel disease and does present a lot of challenges to not only the poor soul who has it but also everyone around them and while I get your parents being anti-care because of horror stories and because they want to be the ones helping her (as would be the same for anyone else), there's a point in the level of deterioration of a person's health where you simply have to accept the reality and do what is right for the person because anything else will only create more suffering and pain for everyone", "NTA - This is never a easy situation to be in. No one wants to put a love one in a home but sometimes its for the best.", "NTA, you're 100% right that she needs better care. I'm sorry you're having to go through this, dementia is hard on everyone in the family.", "NTA It\u2019s the safest place for her.", "NTA. It sounds best for your nan to go to such a facility, or at least safer. They are specialized in taking care of people with dementia and she might even be happier there. \n\nA care facility isn't always a bad thing, although there is a lot of stigma on it. And it isn't always easy to decide this path for your parents, so I also get where your mom is coming from, but it's time to look what is best for your nan.", "NTA and please also think before leaving the kitten when you go back to school. Stuck in a room alone is no life for it, and even if your nan is living elsewhere by then there'll be a lot of extra demands on everyone there. Maybe you have an off-campus friend the kitten could stay with?", "NTA. Your grandma clearly needs to be in a care facility where she can be monitored 24/7, due to the severity of the dementia. \n\nShe needs help, that you guys can\u2019t provide. It sounds like leaving her at home alone could be detrimental to her safety. \n\nYou deserve to live in a safe household, where you don\u2019t have to deal with someone hiding your stuff and behaving aggressively.\n\nYour mom is gonna drive everyone away by being so overprotective of your grandma that she denies her the healthcare she desperately needs.", "NTA\n\nHonestly, it sounds like your nan is a danger to herself and others.  She isn't someone who merely needs someone to do things for her.  She's someone who needs constant supervision.  As in 24/7/365, full-time, at home care.\n\nNobody can provide that by themselves.  Particularly when they have to work to keep food on the table.\n\nThis is precisely why nursing homes exist in the first place.  Even if you were planning on working as a nurse, you wouldn't be working, on-call 24/7/365.  \n\nWhat's best for your nan is to ensure she is safe.  And she won't be at your house.", "NAH\nThis is sadly very typical of dementia patients and of their relatives. Dementia is a brutal thing to go through and to see in your loved ones. I was the asshole for years as I doubted the facilities of my MIL, but at the end it was abundantly clear to all that she was unable to care for herself. It took time though, and there was nothing I could do but wait until the closer family understood.", "NTA, I\u2019m a nurse and your Mum & Uncle need to do what\u2019s best for your Nan, despite how \u2018guilty\u2019 they may feel. \n\nDH and myself have just been thru this with his Nan, the final straw was when she nearly set her house on fire!", "NTA she will be better taken care of in a home. \nAlso she\u2019s a danger to herself and others. She could turn on the stove and forget about it..", "NTA.\n\nIt really sounds like your grandma needs to be in a care facility to have access to the level of care she needs. That\u2019s the most compassionate choice, in this situation, especially if she\u2019s also showing aggression. \n\nYou\u2019re not being selfish.", "Definitely NTA, I worked in a care home for a few months in 2017. Some patients were able to do things for themselves while other more severe dementia patients required constant 1 to 1 care. I was put on with this elderly gentlemen and he had severe dementia, he\u2019d often forget where he was or who I was but just talking to him would calm him down again. The issues began when he became incontinent and had to get a catheter placed. Given the chance he\u2019d rip it right out saying \u2018I don\u2019t need it\u2019. And when stopped he\u2019d start punching and fighting anyone and everyone. I\u2019ve been slapped by him before and I can say he still has his strength. After being slapped I got placed on the lower floor where there weren\u2019t any elderly who were likely to get aggressive. \n\nWhat you wrote about what your nan does is worrying, she is a huge danger to herself and all of the family. You\u2019re family may hate you but it\u2019s better to get a professional help even if it means calling the police to take her.", "NTA", "NTA, you being a care home worker and calling her behaviour aggressive says a lot about her condition. You aren't being selfish, this will help her a lot.", "NTA.  It's a very tough situation for both you and your mom, but it sounds like even your grandma will not be safe living at home.  She needs 24-hour care.  What if she turns on the stove then forgets, she wanders off, etc.?  For her own safety and comfort, as well as yours, she needs to be in an assisted living facility or nursing home.", "NTA\n\nI understand your valid conerns, but it is Mum and Uncle's problem, not yours.  Mum sought prior legal action; therefore, Mum most likely has medical power-of-attorney or guardianship of Nan (or whatever they call it where you live), not you.  From a legal standpoint, you have no say in this situation.  Very likely, it is Mum who legally has the right to make all medical decisions regrding Nan.\n\nIf you live there (and I hope you do not), adamantly refuse to help as you do not feel safe.  Focus on your studies and taking care of your kitten.  I know it is very hard, but you need to disengage from this situation and love your Nan from afar.\n\nYou don't need to do anything.  It won't be long before your Mum and Uncle will get burnt-out and there will be NO other choice but to have help come in or have Nan go to a care facility.  It's only a matter of time.\n\nI speak from experience.\n\n<3", "NTA.\n\nThis is a difficult situation for a family to confront, but it appears that nobody ni the family has the resources to provide adequate care for an aged grandparent with dementia.\n\nI suspect it is your family members' guilty consciences talking, but they should recognize that your proposal is not only best for the family, but also the best for her.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYour parents are AHs endangering your nan - and for putting you in that situation. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nCan you move out?", "No -- your nan is in danger (and a danger to others, including kittens) and this needs to be addressed with full-time care.  \n\n\nUnfortunately, being moved into a new surrounding is a HUGE stressor for dementia and may bring dramatic deterioration.", "NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s a actually a full-time job to do it well & even then it\u2019s possible to be overwhelmed by it.

My mom had vascular dementia and she had to be put in a home because nobody could take care of her properly.

She's having these serious symptoms and has not seen a doctor?  Is that correct?  I hope your nan gets seen by a doctor, any doctor, and soon. They will see she needs medical help.  You imply that your Nan is against treatment and medication, but any EMT will see that she needs medical assistance and lacks capacity, in which case they legally CAN take her to the hospital without her consent.

That\u2019s what needed to be addressed.\n\nAny big change (in care home for example) also resulted in a decline for him as he struggled to understand what was happening.

They are going to come home to her, your animals, or the house itself severely damaged one day if they leave her alone.", "NTA.\n\nI was in a similar situation.  People think dementia patients are just fluffy old people who wistfully get lost in pleasant old memories while quietly sitting on the porch and occasionally asking for someone that passed away years old.  What you described is the reality of later stage dementia - people with fits of anger, paranoia, and depression who can't take care of themselves and can lash out violently, hurting themselves and others as well as damaging their surroundings.  Getting hit in the face with a walker hurts even when it's wielded by an 84 year old.  (Thankfully that didn't happen to me, but I was there went it happened.)\n\nThere comes a point where a care facility is needed and your nan is at point.  Your family feels guilty that they can't take care of her but they'll feel worse if someone gets hurt by your nan or if your nan manages to sneak out of the house and gets hurt.  And if they say that your nan can't make it outside, yeah, I have stories about my MiL who couldn't walk 10 feet without needing to rest making it outside and wandering around waiting for a non-existent taxi to take her back home several states away.", "NTA\u2026you need to have a serious sit down with your mom.  Ask her what she thinks will happen to grab when you go to uni and mom is at work 12 hours a day?  Mom may feel it is wrong to put gran in a facility, or guilt, but ask mom how guilty she would feel if gram wanders outside, gets lost and disoriented and something happens to her?  Or she burns the house down?  There is so much that could go wrong.  When a person gets to the stage your gran is, they require 24/7 care, which no one person or family can provide.  Someone other than family also can see outside the box or from a different perspective and know that what gran says or does or how she acts is not personal, which very little family members can do.  They do not see the disease, but think that is still their mom, sister, or gran. It is a tough roll to be a full time caregiver and many people get burnt out, which does not help the person they are caring for.", "NTA My dad's uncle has dementia. We didn't realize how bad it was until he told us he did laundry and couldn't find any detergent. So he decided to use dish soap instead, but didn't think that would get his clothes clean enough. So he also added gasoline and drano. He's much better and safer in a nursing home.", "NTA. I used to work at home for people with dementia and I have seen alot. Her condition wont get better. Her living condition however can be. Dementia is horrible. Her eating raw meat or no food at all, being incontinent, her feeling stressed and upset due to stimuli around etc. it will only make it worse. She could wander off (without being clothed according to the weather), cause harm to herself in traffic, at home etc, without proper care she could get infections or other things, especially if as i suspect, she is unable to maintain a healthy hygiene and it sounds like she is isnt getting her medicine either. Its very important to think about what her needs are not yours (your family).\n\nLet me tell you a story (i say patient/citizen cause i want it to be extremely neutral). I once met a citizen with severe dementia who couldnt see the family for awhile. When they could visit again, they would overdo it and ask if the citizen had missed them. The answer was no. The whole time the patient had been hallucinating conversation with them when they couldnt visit. They visited every day for their own sake and when they went home we would see how it affected the patient who because very angry, stressed etc. My point with this is : Is your grandmother at your house for your familys sake or hers? \n\nDo you have any kind of contact person where you are from. In my country we have \"dementiacoordinators\" who are usually nurses specialized in this area. They can usually help not just the person who has dementia but also relatives with solutions and help to understand the desease and what proper care could look like. \n\nSum up. You really need to think about whats best for your grandmother and from reading your post I think you are right. She needs additional care that cant be provided in your home. You should contact someone who can help of thats the police then they are the one to call. Im very sorry for you losing your grandmother to dementia.\n\nEdit: To make it more readable.", "it sounds like your nan needs 24/7 care which clearly you can\u2019t provide since you\u2019re a university student and your mom can\u2019t provide the care since she works long shifts every day. putting your grandma in a facility would be the safest and best option at this point.

I know care facilities are expensive, but if you cannot have someone with her 24 x 7 it may be needed.    You sound like the only one with genuine sense here.", "NAH. I was in the exact situation with my grandma many years ago when she developed dementia and it lasted a few years. I\u2019m not sure of your family\u2019s financial situation, but a care facility may be too expensive for your mom to consider. Your mom is just doing the best by your grandma right now which is removing her from your aunt\u2019s care. \n\nYou have every right to feel overwhelmed to see her deteriorate in front of you and want the best care for her. It\u2019s a total disruption to your life with added responsibilities to have to suddenly care for someone with dementia. \n\nIn my situation, of course I wanted her to be in a care facility, but financially my family wasn\u2019t able to provide that. My mom did the best she could (at the expense of her own physical and mental health) for many years until my grandma eventually passed. \n\nMy only advice is to help your mom for the time being. Look up resources that your country may have for assistance. Some days will be good and most will be bad but this is the situation at hand. After my grandma passed, I did wish I helped my mom out more but I was an immature 20-something. Best of luck to you and your family.", "NTA - by any objective standard, she would have a happier life in a memory care ward where the employees are hand selected because they are good with dementia patients.", "NTA. I had an aunt with dementia. It's hard to care for someone who's mind is failing them. I understand being hesitant to send them to a care home, but sometimes that's the best option. You are a good grand child.", "Definitely NTA.  \nINFO:  this is not a nice question, but is money an issue here, meaning that funds for a care facility would come out of her estate?  I wonder if this is contributing to your family\u2019s refusal to accept that your Nan needs care.", "Oy (head in hands) healthcare provider here.\n\nNTA. \nYour family- ESH\n\n1. For the sake if that poor kitten can you rehome him? I\u2019m not saying it lightly because I can tell how much you love him. I\u2019m super worried what will happen when you go to school. He\u2019s going to get forgotten in that room. It\u2019s not healthy for him mentally.\n\n2. Secure a key outside to the chicken area or barns. Do you can always feed/water the animals .\n\n3. Alzheimer drugs don\u2019t help for long- just enough time to get affairs in order. \n\n4. Your parents messed up- she\u2019s more confused because she was moved. It may get better and it may not. \n\n5. It\u2019s absolutely unsafe for her to be there. Your mom can\u2019t take care of her with her schedule. She\u2019s going to wander off. She may fall which could kill her. Don\u2019t you dare put your life on hold to care for her. Your parents made this decision and it\u2019s on them. \n\nHow do you fix it?\n\n1. Elder care lawyer to figure out money and options.\n\n2. Call the county adult protective services and state she\u2019s unsafe living there. It starts a paper trail. \n\n3. Do not start helping your parents out with her- take care of the animals, house things like laundry. No patient care. \n\n4. If she somehow goes to the ER- if you all say it\u2019s unsafe to take her home they have to find a nursing home for her. They will try to guilt you and say awful things. IGNORE! Also don\u2019t sign anything stating you are responsible for her financially at the hospital or nursing home. The hospital will put a social worker in charge.\n\n5. Get online. Look for bed alarms and tracking devices. Put them on grandma. Locks at the top of doors- she\u2019s going to wander. Lock on your rooms so she can\u2019t get in and take stuff. \n\n6. Call the pharmacist. Ask what if her meds can be crushed. Put them in applesauce or pudding.\n\n7. Get her a doctor in town. She needs meds for her behaviors.\n\nI\u2019m really sorry.", "NTA\n\nPeople with dementia need 24/7 supervision and security for their own well being. Period. Your mom can\u2019t provide that for her.", "Why are you thinking of calling the police over an old woman with dementia. That seems very dramatic. Regardless she needs full time care which isn't what yall can provide her.", " I'm sorry you're having to go through this, dementia is hard on everyone in the family.", "I am so sorry for your loss. Thank you for your advice - I will do so. x", "i\u2019m so sorry about your situation, it sounds like it was incredibly tough. thank you for your response though. if it\u2019s ok i will share it with my uncle? despite me experiencing significant physical harm this week as a result of her outbursts, he still is struggling to accept my nan is unwell. even if he is unable to face reality i will have to make sure my nan is safe so thank you for your insight it\u2019s appreciated.", "Thank you truly and deeply for this response. it has really touched a nerve in me. when my aunt was preventing contact between my nan and my mum, and the rest of us, my mum was beside herself. however when we finally saw my nan again, she\u2019d been entirely happy the whole time because she didn\u2019t know that my mum used to ring her every day and she hadn\u2019t missed her or noticed the passage of time. what you\u2019ve said rings true & if it\u2019s alright i\u2019d like my mum to read it. thank you so so much for the time you took to write.", "The police are already involved due to other issues between family members. since my nan doesn\u2019t have a formal diagnosis i don\u2019t think anyone can intervene other than police and healthcare professionals? police came to mind at the time of writing due to the current safety threat", "It's really kind of you to pay for the care chlme for her as well", "If you want more details to try to persuade your uncle, DM me and I'll be happy to provide more.  I worked at a care facility at one point so I knew long before anyone else that MiL was experiencing cognitive decline but no one wanted to listen.", "Its a very difficult situation and its very easy to \"take it personal\" because it really is personal and emotional for everyone involved. Your grandmothers shortterm memory is very much affected cause they are stored differently from longterm memories in the brain. On top of that they often dont have the ability to keep track of time. So it makes sense she is \"living in the past\" at times and she doesnt understand when she last saw you. Most people dont think much about taking a shower and for someone with dementia it can literally be half the energy they have for the day. Thats why proper care is important. \n\nI fully understand what you are going through having both seen it as a professional and as a daughter whos father is very likely in the early stage of dementia. I understand the axiety, hurt and even guilt. Treasure the good moments you can have and allow someone else to take over with her care. And try not to feel guilty if you dont see her every day. That might not be what she needs cause of the amount of stimuli and lack of energy. \n\nI truly hope you get the situation settled and have some peace for good moments with your grandmother.", "I'll ask again. What safety threat does an old woman with dementia pose?", "I\u2019m so sorry you are dealing with this, but you are right. She needs to be some where she can be monitored and medicated. \n\nSome times with dementia, the person can get very violent. They don\u2019t mean to hurt their loved ones, but they don\u2019t recognize you. They are scared and confused and lash out.", "You\u2019re correct, i\u2019m not named in any proceedings however none of her children have guardianship to my knowledge. My mum was merely a last resort as no one else wanted to take her & the evidence was flimsy. Yes, she\u2019s not formally had capacity assessment but she has an appointment on monday at a new dr and i hope they will be more efficient than her last. unfortunately it really is postcode lottery here.\nAlso, I am so sorry for your loss. it must be incredibly tough. i wish you & your family all the best . thank you for your responses here, it is truly appreciated.", "i\u2019m sorry you had the experience of nobody listening too - it is so so frustrating & the thought that my nan\u2019s at risk because they won\u2019t listen is eating me up. thank you so much for your support i really appreciate that.", "she\u2019s physically lashed out at me & my mum multiple times over the past few days, it\u2019s not her fault at all but she doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing. she\u2019s also attempted to harm my cat. neither me or my mum are going to defend ourselves against my elderly grandmother. therefore she has managed to cause significant harm to us.", "Yes - that\u2019s what we\u2019ve experienced & it\u2019s been terrifying for everyone involved. thank you for responding. my guilt has definitely lessened with the assurance that it will be better for her in a home where they can care for her & meet all her needs.", "Thanks for clarifying.\n\nI'm glad your Nan will be seeing a doctor soon!  Hopefully, they will run a slew of tests and find out what's going on and get treatment started.  I'm hoping your Nan will get an accurate diagnosis and prognosis and that she gets the appropriate care that she requires.\n\nThank you for your condolences.  It's hard because my mom's decline from mild dementia to palliative status was very, very fast, and I was completely not expecting that to happen.  I was her primary caregiver for the past 8 years, so now there's just a void.\n\nAll the Best.\n\n\\[edited for grammar\\]", "You're going to struggle to find a decent nursing home for her if she's that violent. Good luck. Hope it all works out.", "It is very sad to have to realize you can\u2019t help a loved one.  It can give you some peace of mind to research good dementia care facilities- most really do can and can offer good supportive help for your grandma. It may not feel great, but it is the right thing.", "OP this is the wrong sub reddit for this situation.\n\nNAH here. This is a tough life experience that has nothing to do with assholes. It seems to have more to do with fear of the unknown.\n\nMy grandfather was a wonderful person until he also developed dementia. It's no one's fault. We also tried to mange his care ourselves until he started walking out of the house and then other relatives pitched in to help get him in a locked care facility.\nMy only advice is to make your grandmother's care the priority not your kitten. For the sake of changing people's mind on the situation. Your kitten concerns are valid but are not what really matters.\nYour grandmother's care on a daily basis is what is most important. I would stick to referring to her lack of safety as the primary reason to get her in 27/7 supervision. Drop the kitten reasons. Truly Good Luck!! This is a hard situation for all involved. Truly!", "No one wants to put a love one in a home but sometimes its for the best."]}
