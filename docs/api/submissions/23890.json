I'm SUPPOSED to work 8am-430pm but my husband always pressures me to log off at 3. He works from home sometimes but sometimes he is out during the day for anywhere from 1-6 hours.\n\nHe always gets mad that I do not greet him at the door, that I am not dressed up and ready for sex at 3pm, and if I work any amount of time past 3 (even 15 minutes) he says I am a workaholic (even though my hours are supposed to be until 4:30pm). He also asks me to do some housework during my working hours (nothing crazy, just vacuuming, switching laundry, emptying the dishwasher) but if I can't get to it because I'm in meetings all day or extremely busy at work he will get mad, even if I offer to do it after 3pm. \n\nHe says all I care about is work. He also said I'm being ridiculous because I don't even have to work (he makes a ridiculous amount of money) but I LIKE my job, and love my coworkers, and I've been promoted several times and make 6 figures and just never want to be completely dependent on anyone because you never know what will happen. Also, I'm genuinely not the sahm type, I would go bonkers. \n\nHe is in sales so if he's not out at a lunch with a client or something he's home and he admittedly has a lot of down time when he is home, so I guess he thinks my job is the same even though it's not. He says he only actually \"works\" a few hours a day.\n\nAnyway, my rationale for not greeting him at the door when he comes home is:\n\n1. Sometimes I'm in a meeting or on a call\n2. Sometimes I genuinely don't hear him come in\n3. When I do hear him and I'm not on a call I'll call out a \"hey/hi\"/whatever\n4. We live together. I see him everyday. He also isn't ever gone an insane amount of time, 6 hours at MOST. And that's rare. \n5. I work in the same room every day. He knows where I am. Why doesn't he just come greet me?\n\nAITA? Is this something other couples do?", "created_utc": 1691186054, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15id667/aita_for_not_greeting_my_husband_at_the_door/", "score": 505, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm SUPPOSED to work 8am-430pm but my husband always pressures me to log off at 3. He works from home sometimes but sometimes he is out during the day for anywhere from 1-6 hours.\n\nHe always gets mad that I do not greet him at the door, that I am not dressed up and ready for sex at 3pm, and if I work any amount of time past 3 (even 15 minutes) he says I am a workaholic (even though my hours are supposed to be until 4:30pm). He also asks me to do some housework during my working hours (nothing crazy, just vacuuming, switching laundry, emptying the dishwasher) but if I can't get to it because I'm in meetings all day or extremely busy at work he will get mad, even if I offer to do it after 3pm. \n\nHe says all I care about is work. He also said I'm being ridiculous because I don't even have to work (he makes a ridiculous amount of money) but I LIKE my job, and love my coworkers, and I've been promoted several times and make 6 figures and just never want to be completely dependent on anyone because you never know what will happen. Also, I'm genuinely not the sahm type, I would go bonkers. \n\nHe is in sales so if he's not out at a lunch with a client or something he's home and he admittedly has a lot of down time when he is home, so I guess he thinks my job is the same even though it's not. He says he only actually \"works\" a few hours a day.\n\nAnyway, my rationale for not greeting him at the door when he comes home is:\n\n1. Sometimes I'm in a meeting or on a call\n2. Sometimes I genuinely don't hear him come in\n3. When I do hear him and I'm not on a call I'll call out a \"hey/hi\"/whatever\n4. We live together. I see him everyday. He also isn't ever gone an insane amount of time, 6 hours at MOST. And that's rare. \n5. I work in the same room every day. He knows where I am. Why doesn't he just come greet me?\n\nAITA?

As far as he's concerned he is the focus of the household. This is not a good sign!", "I joke about wanting a rich husband so I can do whatever I want but I'm already doing that. I love my career too . \n\nGet him a dog though \ud83e\udd23\n\nDoes he do the things he expects of you ?", "He doesn't want you to have economic and social independence away from him. He is purposely trying to sabotage your career. \nWhat happens when you refuse his insistence?\nIs he controlling in other areas?\nLook up the different types of DV. Isolation, coercive control, financial control- these are all types of DV.\nAlso do YOU want sex at 3pm every day? If not you can add sexual coercion to the list. \nHas he tried to isolate you from your family as well? Was it his choice for you to WFH instead of in the office?\n\nNTA. It sounds like you need an escape plan tbh.", "And exactly WHY can't he greet you in your office when he gets home?!?\n\nPlease don't quit your job. This is not a loving spouse. If this is new behavior it makes be suspicious that he's another follower of the Andrew Tate BS.", "This guy's gonna ruin your life if you let him.", "And what happens if he dies or becomes disabled? What do you and the kids do for money? I can honestly tell you that my housewife phase was the stupidest time of my life. It was isolating and crazy making. Then, when he left me high and dry with two kids, I had nothing. Keep your job and your own money. It doesn't matter how much money he's making because awful shit happens and can happen to literally anyone.", "He doesn\u2019t want you to work so he can treat you poorly and you\u2019ll have no income to leave. If you do leave your job, it\u2019ll be that your friends are bad or you visit family too much .", "Please please please don\u2019t lose your job. And why do you even want someone with these kinds of expectation? Please don\u2019t say you\u2019re selling out for his salary. Please don\u2019t have any (more) kids. He\u2019s trying to contain you.", "If y'all are grossing 400K+ he can hire someone to do the chores he's too lazy to do while you work a full-time job. \n\nI literally hate him, LOL.", "There are lots of women who want that life, they aren't hard to find. Why didn't he marry any of them? Because he doesn't want someone who wants the same things he wants. He wants to take what he wants from someone who doesn't want to give it to him.", "How old are you both?", "She makes 6 figures on her own, she'll be comfortable with or without him.", "Didn\u2019t you read the post? She makes enough money herself to live independently of her husband, she doesn\u2019t need his money. If that\u2019s what she was after then why would she insist on working when he wants her to give up her job.", "Did *you* read the post and read how much she makes on her own?", "Money is irrelevant, you need to get out of this situation immediately", "i find it impossible to believe that not once whole dating and planning a wedding , hypotheticals such as \u201cwhen my career takes off, will you quit your job? i would love a housewife\u2026\u201d \u201cwhen I have kids , i want to stay home / not stay home,\u201d \u201ci think men and women should both be financially independent in a marriage,\u201d \u201ctraditional gender roles are important\u201d \u201ci don\u2019t want Kids and I want to work until I\u2019m 90\u201d like you just didn\u2019t discuss anything that could come up? you just liked the dude and liked chillin? I\u2019m so confused how you could marry each other and not know you have entirely different values regarding \u2026 roles in a home lol", "Right, because June Cleaver wasn\u2019t working.  June got to spend her time cooking, doing needlepoint and flower arrangements, and making sure her hair and eyebrows were on fleek.", "It's not the wanting a hug, it's the whole attitude of him feeling like he's God's gift to women, and that any woman in his presence should be grateful.", "It's the expectation.", "He wants her to prematurely leave her work day so she'll be dressed up for sex as soon as he walks in the door regardless of of her own desires or the fact that this would further take away from her busy work schedule. Bizarre.", "There\u2019s so many \ud83d\udea9in this whole thing I just can\u2019t even", "This \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffd\n\nHe wants you to be financially dependent on him so he can control you", "This should be higher up", "Ummm...it sounds pretty abusive already.", "It\u2019s already abusive.", "Does no one find it slightly weird for a man to say he wants a housewife? Like wanting to have a SAHP if you have kids, yes worth a convo of who would stay home, but just wanting your wife to stay home and clean and be entirely dependent on you and not want her to change her mind is kinda gross.", "Yes exactly this. Thanks for answering for me! Spot on.", "I have a girlfriend and everytime i see her I expect a hug, you know why? Because we love each other and its a act of love\u2026 It doesn\u2019t mean i am a abusive boyfriend", "Or maybe her spouse that hardly works any hours could, idk, see what needs cleaning and do it himself?", "That solves only one of the many problems here, though.", "Do you stand in a T pose waiting for one like described?", "Also, someone can have bad habits and behaviors without being abusive.", "Absolutely, and a big smile on my face when i do it", "I agree", "Does she appreciate it?", "She loves it because she also thinks its a act of love, idk how some people love one another but they can\u2019t have \u201cphysical contact\u201d isn\u2019t that the fun part of having a partner?", "So it sounds like it's not a problem for you. Interesting thing about people is we see things differently."]}
