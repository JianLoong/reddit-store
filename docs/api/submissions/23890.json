I'm SUPPOSED to work 8am-430pm but my husband always pressures me to log off at 3. He works from home sometimes but sometimes he is out during the day for anywhere from 1-6 hours.\n\nHe always gets mad that I do not greet him at the door, that I am not dressed up and ready for sex at 3pm, and if I work any amount of time past 3 (even 15 minutes) he says I am a workaholic (even though my hours are supposed to be until 4:30pm). He also asks me to do some housework during my working hours (nothing crazy, just vacuuming, switching laundry, emptying the dishwasher) but if I can't get to it because I'm in meetings all day or extremely busy at work he will get mad, even if I offer to do it after 3pm. \n\nHe says all I care about is work. He also said I'm being ridiculous because I don't even have to work (he makes a ridiculous amount of money) but I LIKE my job, and love my coworkers, and I've been promoted several times and make 6 figures and just never want to be completely dependent on anyone because you never know what will happen. Also, I'm genuinely not the sahm type, I would go bonkers. \n\nHe is in sales so if he's not out at a lunch with a client or something he's home and he admittedly has a lot of down time when he is home, so I guess he thinks my job is the same even though it's not. He says he only actually \"works\" a few hours a day.\n\nAnyway, my rationale for not greeting him at the door when he comes home is:\n\n1. Sometimes I'm in a meeting or on a call\n2. Sometimes I genuinely don't hear him come in\n3. When I do hear him and I'm not on a call I'll call out a \"hey/hi\"/whatever\n4. We live together. I see him everyday. He also isn't ever gone an insane amount of time, 6 hours at MOST. And that's rare. \n5. I work in the same room every day. He knows where I am. Why doesn't he just come greet me?\n\nAITA? Is this something other couples do?", "created_utc": 1691186054, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15id667/aita_for_not_greeting_my_husband_at_the_door/", "score": 2208, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm SUPPOSED to work 8am-430pm but my husband always pressures me to log off at 3. He works from home sometimes but sometimes he is out during the day for anywhere from 1-6 hours.\n\nHe always gets mad that I do not greet him at the door, that I am not dressed up and ready for sex at 3pm, and if I work any amount of time past 3 (even 15 minutes) he says I am a workaholic (even though my hours are supposed to be until 4:30pm). He also asks me to do some housework during my working hours (nothing crazy, just vacuuming, switching laundry, emptying the dishwasher) but if I can't get to it because I'm in meetings all day or extremely busy at work he will get mad, even if I offer to do it after 3pm. \n\nHe says all I care about is work. He also said I'm being ridiculous because I don't even have to work (he makes a ridiculous amount of money) but I LIKE my job, and love my coworkers, and I've been promoted several times and make 6 figures and just never want to be completely dependent on anyone because you never know what will happen. Also, I'm genuinely not the sahm type, I would go bonkers. \n\nHe is in sales so if he's not out at a lunch with a client or something he's home and he admittedly has a lot of down time when he is home, so I guess he thinks my job is the same even though it's not. He says he only actually \"works\" a few hours a day.\n\nAnyway, my rationale for not greeting him at the door when he comes home is:\n\n1. Sometimes I'm in a meeting or on a call\n2. Sometimes I genuinely don't hear him come in\n3. When I do hear him and I'm not on a call I'll call out a \"hey/hi\"/whatever\n4. We live together. I see him everyday. He also isn't ever gone an insane amount of time, 6 hours at MOST. And that's rare. \n5. I work in the same room every day. He knows where I am. Why doesn't he just come greet me?\n\nAITA?

And he uses it to let himself in and if I don\u2019t call out a hello from my work station he checks if I\u2019m maybe on a call before calling out.

Well, one day when I finished vacuuming and he started toward the vacuum, I said, \u201cHold it right there. If you pick up that vacuum and redo what I just spent all this time doing, I will never vacuum again and it will be your job from now on.\u201d He looked me right in the eye as he picked up the vacuum and started redoing it.
