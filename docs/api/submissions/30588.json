My dad (D)'s hard working & rich, he didn't have the look and M thought he wouldn't be like grandpa, cause grandpa's really handsome at his young ages and cheated on grandma while she's pregnant. But it's ended tragically like her mom, worse. \n\nM caught D cheating with tons of women but she still chose to forgive him. After that sh*t got out, D went loose, he didn't have to hide anymore. He hooked up with the housekeeper, his sister's friends, M's friends, grandma's friends, whoever came to our house as a woman, he hooked them all up. To the point M had to settle all relationships for him, he once offered the neighbor's wife to sleep with him and he would pay her some money to buy some more food for her son. Let's call her Eve, so Eve took that deal, hid from her family and slept with him 3 times. My dad paid 1 time, so Eve came to our house to confessed to M everything. But M still paid Eve for that 2 times she slept with D. \n\nThey divorced when I was 2 and he took custody, M had to leave with empty hand and could only visit me once a week. D took care of me for 3 days and I was in the way of him & his new mistress so he kicked me back to my mom and paid $2/week as child support (it was 2001).\n\nM taught me how to ask my dad for money since I was little. That sh*t got me the childhood trauma because after the ringtone, it would always be him yelll at me ask why I'm so stubborn. I remember I've always cried after I spoke on the phone with him but eventually he would gave us more money as child support. I was growing up without a Dad model around. I wished I had but I didn't.\n\nWe kept going like this for years until his current wife ( massage staff worked next to my dad's house and the reason to M and my dad divorced) drown herself in gambling, got him completely broke. They both took off together and loaners came banging on their door for months.\n\nI assumed he didn't inform me so maybe I'm not that important to him anyway. We moved on.\nYears later, 2021 he called M while we're driving, I was tearing up because I was glad to hear his voice and I still remember that day was my birthday, I was thinking omg he remember my birthday. \nMe: Hey dad, hru? Are you good? Where are you now? \nD: Hey yeh yeh good. Ask your mom if she has $100 l can borrow?\n\nI went silent after that, my heart dropped as I kept hearing him say \"Come on ask your mom, I need it\". He then texted his bank info & sent to us while pushing, I cried & hung up. M did end up send him $100, and he didn't call back to say anything about my birthday. So on, if anyone askes me about my dad or where is he now, I'd say my dad is dead along time ago. That news somehow got to D and he got pissed, annoyed. He called M saying she has failed raising me and it was her fault. My uncle also didn't stand with me on this and saying no matter what family is more important.

He has opinions about it of course, some of my family also thought the same. But for what he have done to me and my family, on my personal perspective, he's completely dead to me.

You would not be the AH if you told everyone you were an orphan.\n\nI've been in similar position. My Mom's ex (notice I didn't call him father?) disowned me when I was SIX, for no fault of my own. So when I was seven, I disowned him right back. Not my father, oh no, not now not ever. My MOM'S mistake. \n\nSo when people would ask me who my dad was, I told them I didn't have one. Of course, they didn't believe that and would badger me about it; so when I was 9, I started telling people I was the Second Immaculate Conception.

Until I got to high school and none of my friends have that kind of experience and then I knew. But I don't blame my mom", "And I can assure you that's my life, no bullsh*t fr. D did offer that on a written paper, not to court ofc. I can't tell you the exact country I'm in as I know my friends are up here too, as this's my deep secret I don't want them to know, but it's in South Asia and it's not Korea or Japan or China.
