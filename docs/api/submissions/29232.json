The issue is not who you work for, the issue is that you GF is freaking passing out from exhaustion and overwork.  At her current rate she won't have a career to worry about.  You are right to be concerned.", "NTA. She won\u2019t go far in her career if she pass out in front of a boss or a client. And also it\u2019s not fair to assume that just because your father has employed you, he does not expect you to be a productive member of staff.", "NTA\n\nRemember that it's you and her against the problem, not you versus her. She's not going to take the time off, clearly.\n\nHowever, you can ask that she be civil about your own career. It's not and should never be a weapon to beat you with. She's TA for going there.", "NTA Burn out is real and can prevent your girlfriend from progressing in her career as her body breaks down on her.", "NTA, but you need to understand that you have a completely different perspective then she does. The work culture (I'm guessing your in the US with this kind of conversation) here needs to change, but it so far hasn't, and working for family(usually) gives you a freedom to say \"I need a break\" that a lot of us just don't have. Hustle culture is abhorrent, and it sounds like she is caught in it. She needs your sympathy and support, but she currently doesn't feel like she can just \"take a break\" and you won't change that by nagging. Good luck, hopefully she can get to a place where she can relax a bit, but for a lot of us we have to worry that the guy in the next cube isn't taking a break, so I can't if I want that next promotion.", "It sounds as if you\u2019re girlfriend has a demanding job and wants to move up the corporate ladder. So she has years of intense work hours in her future.  And by you telling her to just take a break, makes it seem insensitive because she has no choice, but to work that hard and long. in some companies, leaving the office before 7pm is frowned upon; and the people that leave never get promoted because they are seem as lazy. Your gf wants to have a successful career and she has to prove that she can do that job. She needs you to give her a massage and a glass of wine, not a lecture about working too hard.", "NAH\n\nHowever. Did you ask her how she was doing first? How being so busy was affecting her? Or did you go right into 'hey you should take a break'\n\nShe needed support, a kind ear, for you to ask her what she needs. Not for you to decide what she needs and inform her of your solution", "NAH\n\nbut please remember the golden rule, when your GF's struggling, ask her first if you can listen to her or she would rather have your insight. Something tells me, in this case, she would rather you just listen to her decompress than the \"advice\". Honestly, you chose a very different career path than her, which is absolutely alright, however, you have no idea how it looks in her office. So going straight to advice mode seems a bit insensitive.\n\nMe and my partner have also very different work setups, I am full typical corporate while they're in a small family-type company. They have a very, very different work culture (from his stories to me visiting sometimes, I know). My partner never worked in a typical corporation. And while both have their advantages and disadvantages, both are valid jobs. But of course, sometimes it is hard for us to understand each other due to our differences, that's quite normal. IT came off so aggressive in your case because she's so exhausted. IF you really want to help her, maybe a spa day on some off her days of or just leaving her home alone with ordered for and a book for a day would help ?", "NAH you're not an asshole for being concerned about her however she clearly wants to get ahead in her career and that takes effort and being tired a lot for now, you needed to drop it when she said she didn't want to take time off, it's your own fault that she snapped at you when you didn't drop it", "YTA sometimes mom and dad help make life easy and sometimes people don't have that and need to work themselves to the bone to get where they're trying to go. If you're really concerned for her then it's time to start cooking, cleaning and doing her laundry etc etc. She has a goal to achieve and you can't reduce her workload but you can give her more free time to rest which will help more than anything else you could do.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
