He sounds like a pain to live with. And I'm speaking as an Autistic. I do think he should be learning right from wrong though. Flushing the toilet should be a necessity, especially if you and him share the bathroom. He's probably doing it to rile you up. I do think your parents should be nipping his bad behavior in the bud, otherwise no one will want to hang out him and he will upset more people than just you. I don't think they're doing everything they should be doing.  \n\n\nEdit: I do wonder if he has resentment for you just having been born and existing. His anger, \"jokes\", and rudeness seem to be placed mostly on you. He would've been around 4 years old when you were born. That's hard enough on a kid without special needs, so it's probably harder on him. I'm not excusing what he does though. That's sounds like a horrible way to live.", "NTA but your family dynamic sounds really tough. Sorry you're having to go through that. \n\nMe and my brother were autistic kids and he used to call me worm, we'd physically fight all the time, hed shout and scream about stuff and just physically beat me up a lot but id do the same back. One day he just stopped. He was nicer, generous, just a different person. I hope one day the same happens to you and you'll learn to forgive him but its understandable if you dont. \n\nI wish your parents would create a better living environment for you as its not fair for you to have to go through that. \n\nAlso high functioning doesnt exist. Autism is autism, everyone functions differently and looks can be deceiving. From what you've said your brother clearly needs more help and care than hes getting.", "NTA, you have every right to your feelings, which are natural.  you're feeling potentially unsafe and unprotected in your home, a place you *should*feel supported.  is there any way you could move in with your dad, even as a temporary measure?", "NTA for your strong reaction. He sounds like he's been bullying the whole household (your mother included). Sounds like he needs therapy and some (appropriate) consequences for his behavior, but at this point your parents concern should be keeping you safe.\n\nYou have several years still until uni. Is there any chance you can extend the time you spend with your father, and you and your brother can switch off who stays with which parent (so you two are separated)? Talk to your parents and see if they have other ideas. I'm worried that your brother's behavior will escalate and you won't be safe.", "NTA. He doesn't treat you with any semblance of respect and refuses to do things to help himself. If you can spend more time with your father that might be useful. He's an adult, if he is continuing to do things that make you, a teenager, feel out of place in your home, your mother needs to step up and look at other options. \n\nJust because he is autistic does not give him an excuse to behave like that- I'm autistic too. I obviously don't know your situation but he needs some sort of therapy or intervention if he is actually high functioning. The life you are currently living seems hellish and he should be able to change with help.", "People can be in a wheelchair and be an asshole. People can be autistic and be an asshole.

We have to take turns going to my dads house on weekends because we literally need a break from each other. He happens to be highly functioning on the autism spectrum. I am going to spew out some of his random behaviours below:\n\n1.) He refuses to call me anything other than \u201cbrat\u201d. This makes me extremely uncomfortable and I have to make my mum eventually yell at him to stop. He never listens.\n\n2.) He will never take responsibility for anything and diverts his entitled behaviour onto me. For example, when we were in the car with my mum he started screaming basic instructions from the backseat to \u201cMOVE!\u201d \u201cLEFT!\u201d \u201cRIGHT!\u201d \u201cSTOP!\u201d \u201cDRIVE!\u201d. I pointed out he had no right to do that as he failed his driving test and that this was extremely irritating. He then started going on a rant about how annoying I was for \u201cmaking noise all the time\u201d and that it wasn\u2019t his fault at all. (I was silent for the entire car journey)\n\n3.) He refuses to wear his noise-cancelling headphones yet he will start banging on walls aggressively if he hears the slightest bit of noise or music coming from my room. About 30 seconds of this later he storms out of his room and starts complaining to my mum until she threatens to start crying because of his name-calling. This happens on a near daily basis and he refuses to understand that the house can\u2019t be dead silent all the time. During this he starts saying \u201cWhy don\u2019t you discipline that brat?\u201d which also makes me extremely uncomfortable. \n\nHe also has disgusting hygiene habits which made me have to use my mum\u2019s bathroom for a while. When I decided to finally stop, I looked into the toilet and saw about 5+ massive logs of s*** floating in brown water. \n\nMost of the time I let my anger get the best of me and retaliate which probably causes his behaviours to continue. One time I said he has the emotional intelligence of an 8 year old but he just started obnoxiously laughing.\n\nOverall, living with him is a truly miserable experience and he won\u2019t be leaving anytime soon. As soon as l move out for uni I\u2019m never interacting with him again. I have no remorse for him at all and would not be upset if he ended up dying.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Each and every one of the behaviors you listed is horrific, and autist or not, he has no right to be treating you this way", "OP is 100% NTA.  As a person on the spectrum, all of this behaviour is just him being an insufferable ass.  Misophonia is really hard for me to deal with but I would never take it out on other people.  Sounds like the parents have allowed the brother to engage in disgusting and abusive behaviour while using his disability as an excuse: \u201cbUt hE iS AuTiStiC!\u201d I feel so bad for OP having to live with that turd.", "He sounds like a prick and ironically a brat, so NTA", "NTA Most of what he does is asshole behavior, not autistic behavior. I hate people who use there disability as an excuse to be a jerk. Source. I am a high functioning autistic adult. (Though the terms have changed)", "Your edit makes sense.  It does sound like he's very manipulative and that is targeted on OP.  She needs time away from this situation and the parents really should be taking more responsibility in creating a safe, peaceful home for each child.  \n\nIt would be healthier for everyone for the kids to live in separate homes since it sounds like the parents are separated.  This situation is exhausting on everyone involved.", "> Also high functioning doesnt exist. \n\n(Not OP)\n\nAs a parent (with autism) of a child (with autism)... I still accidentally say this sometimes. Change is hard lol.\n\nBUT the reason I'm replying to you is I'm curious how other people with autism think of the term my (very small) parents of autism group has been using, which is \"advanced masking\".\n\nAs in like... someone on the spectrum who has learned enough coping techniques to mask most of the time... to a point where NTs can't usually tell they have autism.\n\nStill not sure how I feel about it, as it seems (slightly?) to indicate masking as the most desirable outcome, but idk...\n\nAnyway, I think you're right about the OP's situation. Often those behaviors will change on their own as people mature, but really the parent(s) should be handling the problem long before then...", "You deserve to feel safe and comfortable in your own home", "Agreed on every point. OP shouldn't have to spend the last of her minor years living like this. She should be enjoying high school and the perks, and not worrying about her bully brother.", "I don't have a strong opinion on that term and i haven't actually heard it before. I know from experience that most people can't tell i have autism, but i also think that can be from people's inexperience and misunderstanding of autism as well as the fact autism doesn't have a look and lots of autistic traits can be other disorders symptoms. \n\nI agree that it does seem to put masking on a pedestal, but i also believe its up to the individual to decide what terms they like to use for themselves.", "As a parent (who probably has autism) with a young child who has recently been diagnosed, even his doctor used the term \"high functioning\".\n\nOverall it's definitely a spectrum, but I think one of the dividing lines between a \"high\" or \"low\" would probably be how the individual communicates and what their language skills are.", "yeah... it seems more accurate, I think... \n\nLike people are always impressed with my teen like \"oh they are so high functioning\" like... lol no, but they can pretend for a while :P ! \n\nbut it still makes me uncomfortable.\n\nAnyway, thanks for your thoughts!", "Yeah... doctors mostly still do. There's been a lot of pushback though, from people who are actually on the spectrum.\n\nThe problem is that \"high functioning\" indicates a binary system where some people should be able to just blend in with NT people, and some are just... barely able to exist.\n\nIt implies a right and wrong way to be.\n\nBut it's all a spectrum, and even \"communication skills\" can be so different from individual to individual.\n\nPlus like... you'll run into a lot of people who will expect the impossible from your child, or insist you're wrong about their needs/abilities because \"oh well I thought because they're so high functioning\" or whatever. Or tell you they can't do/qualify for something because they're low-functioning.\n\nIt's just a lot of ... people who don't know anything thinking they know something because they learned a word, lol."]}
