How often does he put his ex before you? Why does your bf need his ex to think he's single?", "NTA. At least now you know how little your boyfriends values you.", "NTA\n\nIf he's hiding you from the ex six months in, there's something else going on. He's shown you his priorities, and sad to say, it's not you.", "NTA\n\nIf he is so scared his ex will find out about you then he is probably still seeing his ex.\n\nThis is a big red flag.\n\nWalk away, he is a AH\n\nSee if someone can lend you an electric radiator for a few days.

I get that you don\u2019t want to be told to dump him. And I\u2019m not necessarily saying you should. But your health and well-being are literally on the line due to the heating situation, and your boyfriend has shown you zero compassion or regard for your well-being. \n\nHe\u2019s showing you how little he cares for your needs now, and if you let it slide/\u201cwork through it\u201d I promise, and he will do it again. \n\nI\u2019m also sorry but, there\u2019s something else going on. I would be wary that he may still be seeing/talking to his ex, or even worse.", "NTA, i know you said you won\u2019t dump him but i hope you do. you are not his priority. he\u2019s happy for you to bum around in libraries and cafes all day and sleep in a freezing apartment bcs.. he wants to avoid introducing you to a friend of his ex? he doesn\u2019t want his ex knowing about you - think about why. \n\nhe\u2019s either 1. still in love with her. 2. still seeing her. 3 both.\n\nthe title doesn\u2019t make it sound worse, the context is actually 10x worse girl. wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it\u2019s the ex staying with him. any man that actually values you would never be ok with leaving you out in the cold. sorry", "NTA - your bf\u2019s buddy can visit any time. Right now, you need a warm place to sleep and that should take priority over hanging with a buddy. Also, does anyone know about your relationship? Or is it a secret just from his ex? IMO it is a red flag that your relationship is a secret when your bf and his ex broke up SIX months ago. Why is he shielding his ex at your expense? Are there still feelings there? Something doesn\u2019t add up here. \n\nAlso, do you have a heated blanket or the ability to get one? Doesn\u2019t have to be fancy just something to tide you over for a few days.

Because I would be concerned about his well being.  I would not kick out my boyfriend because a friend of mine MIGHT be uncomfortable about someone who isn't in my life anymore. \n\nTo me, it sounds like your BF doesn't want his friend to tell the ex you're dating.  Because he wants to keep that door open.  He might not want to get back together with the ex right now, but...  he's not ready to close that door. \n\nNTA.", "NTA...Your boyfriend has shown you where his priorities are.

Look, if any of my friends (actual friend friends, not boy/girlfriends) would have broken heating, I'll let them crash at mine without a second thought. Your bf can have you over for a few nights as a friend, if he has legitimate reasons to want his ex to not know. It's not too hard to not behave as a couple for a few days.\n\nAlso, yuo say his other friends know he's dating you. How this is supposed to work? Is he going to hide his buddy from anyone, won't they meet other people while his buddy visits? How is he so sure no one mentions his new gf?\n\nI really would be contacting the ex at this point to make sure she knows she's an ex, and not a LD gf. Not to snitch on your bf, but to be sure I'm not stuck in the middle of the other couple's drama.", "The man isn't even in an actual quandary. He is prioritizing someone and something else. OP can walk away with no guilt. Who needs this BS? \"You can't be here for me right now? I get it. And I just got over this reality.

Just kick rocks. Its time.", "This is the 1rst time anything like that happened and he never ever made me feel like I'm second choice before this.

He also said he feels like an asshole for this.", "I understand that perspective, but he truly had been showing me that I am his priority in many ways and this is the first time that something like this is in question.", "The possibility of them two still seeing each other is close to zero since she lives in another town a few hours away from where we are, where he has not gone at all in all this time.\n\nJust to add, I think it just him trying to avoid an awkward situation with the friend, since that friend is the one who introduced him to the ex.", "Exactly. When sh*t hits the fan, you learn very quickly who your real friends/allies are.", "I second this! Total red flags!!!", "Yeah, buddy actually lives in another country, so it's not that he can visit anytime.

So even if he is the greatest guy on the planet that means you matter the least.", "Too bad he isn't a people pleaser when it comes to his actual gf...", "But babe, this is a HUGE way to make you feel like not a priority - it's literally your health and wellness that he doesn't care about.", "But the friend already knows you two broke up. So what exactly would be so awkward for him?", "I don't understand what makes you think that would be an \"awkward\" situation?

But just sleep. The rest of my house must be comfortably warm. Sleeping is not the biggest issue here - you can use more blankets, or even an electric blanket to keep you warm.
