You\u2019re right it doesn\u2019t make sense to rent a new apartment when you own a house, but you don\u2019t seem to have realised that she definitely *did* prove her point.\n\nHer point was: the house you\u2019re in is *your* house alone, not because you own it, but because you are unable to acknowledge it as her house too if she moves in. You even said \u201cit\u2019s *my* house and my family can visit me\u201d. Ok, fair enough. But the point she was making is that you wouldn\u2019t see it as your joint property, she wouldn\u2019t be able to decide guests there, have a right to veto decisions. If anything, you see it as your house that your gf is also staying in.\n\nNow I actually don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong in you thinking of a house that you own as your house alone.

The solution she\u2019s proposed for this is that you both rent some place together where you hold equal status. Another solution would be for you to adjust your mindset and view your gf in your house as another \u201cowner\u201d, someone who can make decisions for the house without having to be \u201callowed\u201d to do so.

You proved her point exactly. Yes, you paid off the house and it is yours to do as you please. She knows that it is yours and that she has no rights to it. She understands that.

My fiance (we were dating 2.5 years when he bought) owns our home.  When parents/family want to visit, they typically stay for at least 8-10 days since we live on opposite sides of the country.  But we always talk about it - there's no \"veto\" but we each have a solid 50/50 say when others, regardless of \"who's side\" is coming to visit/stay.  We also have a 50/50 weight on opinions when it comes to changing anything in the house, getting more pets, spending money on things, decor, etc etc. \n\nI think your wording is what's the issue.  \"You can change whatever you want!\" versus \"I'll let you.\"  However, I think HER words are not quite right either - she should have a right to voice her opinion, definitely.

You would not \"give up\" your house, that's a big ask, but you would have no problem asking a partner to give up a possibly stable living arrangement, where she has full tenant rights, to move into your house, where in many jurisdictions she would have zero protection as a live-in partner. You would want a trial run during which you risk absolutely nothing, not even any inconvenience, while the partner can find themselves homeless if you decide it's not working out a month into the arrangement. You would give them \"input\" while they are auditioning for being a good enough roommate, but they will have zero guarantee that they will be treated fairly.\n\nYour perspective is very skewed. In today's challenging housing market, OP would be in a considerably better position by renting his house for a short time, almost certainly for more than his share of the rent would be in a place he got with his girlfriend, for this trial run of, say, a year. If it doesn't work out, at the end of the year he will return to his house, maybe with some money saved, if his share of the rent plus the mortgage, if any, is lower than the rent he will be getting (not impossible with rents as high as they are). The girlfriend on the other hand will have to find another flat and roommate situation either way, but at least she will be a legal tenant during the trial, not a guest who can get kicked out at any time.", "What did she do??", "If my boyfriend told me even in the apartment we share right now that he could veto my family visiting (or vice versa) it would be immediately over.

Ability to veto \u2260 thing actually getting vetoed, it's about having a say in it. \nThis is the reason gf doesn't want to move into his place and rather them get a new place together is so it's both their place and they both get to have a say in things regarding the space.", "Would you room with anyone who thought they could have someone else stay in your home for weeks without your input?", "Op stated in a comment that his gf family would not be allowed to stay in the house due to it being his house.", "he literally said her family wouldn\u2019t be able to stay because it\u2019s his house. that\u2019s shitty and why people are making him out to be bad", "You are being sarcastic right ?", "Actually I take it back.

Often times there's conflict about one partner paying rent into equity they won't be entitled to. This wouldn't be a concern for a tenant, but being a couple complicates the landlord relationship. Even if you're not charging her, there's a certain amount of say adults like to have in their living situation to be comfortable.

This mindset will carry over into a lot of decision making, big and small.

Shes a menace to society and being in her 70s isn\u2019t an excuse", "What did your husband do?", "I didn\u2019t see that one. I guess if he\u2019s unwilling to compromise at all. Then that\u2019s dumb.", "Marry her if you like.", "A girlfriend shouldn\u2019t have a say of whether I live in the house I OWN. You reverse the situation and you\u2019d still call the man an ahole. So don\u2019t come at me with that double standard bs. If it\u2019s that big an issue for her. She can just date someone else. Just as if the roles where reversed and she was the one with the house. Dude can date someone else.", "Heh, and one of the ways I like to rib my *mother-in-law* is that I've set her ring tone to \"Night on Bald Mountain\".  (That's the music in Fantasia that plays while the demon [Chernabog](https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Chernabog) is rising from the mountain.)\n\n(Whenever it goes off in her presence, she playfully swats my arm and says my full name.  Then usually giggles.)", "> He says \u201cshes just old\u201d\n\n\"Wow so she's had *thirty more years than us* to figure out how to be an adult?\"", "Can you put a lock on your bedroom or closet? Sorry you\u2019re dealing with this.", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever marry anyone. I didn\u2019t believe people like you actually existed, I thought it was all memes", "I think you are forgetting that OP is the one who suggested she moves in.  So let\u2019s not pretend that she initiated the idea. That\u2019s first.\n\nSecond, I was talking about the comment where OP\u2019s refusal to, hypothetically, host girlfriend\u2019s family boils down to \u201cI paid for this house so I make the rules\u201d. Which is fair but it doesn\u2019t prove the girlfriend\u2019s point.\n\nWho would want to live in a house where every single thing can be countered with \u201cmy house, so I decide what you can and cannot do\u201d.\n\nEDIT: As for what the girlfriend can and can\u2019t decide, I sincerely hope that this is just your take on this situation. Because I am getting some serious red flags from your response.", "You have your opinion . I have mine. Not saying in this case the boyfriend isn\u2019t a jerk. But his girlfriend given the \u201clittle \u201c information we\u2019re given to make our opinion is more of jerk.\n\nIf I dated someone and already had my own life together with a house and all that\u2026and they straight up said they wouldn\u2019t live in the house because it wasn\u2019t partly there\u2019s. That personally is a red flag, because it shouldn\u2019t flippin matter. If you\u2019re making hypotheticals of \u201cI don\u2019t want you\u2019re family to come by\u201d that\u2019s a red flag, why is that the hypothetical you chose? \n\nAnd the fact it\u2019s just a girlfriend and not a fianc\u00e9 is a red flag, and it goes both ways like I mentioned previously. I woman shouldn\u2019t have to put up with that either. Point is, she comes across as controlling.", "Except that she didn\u2019t ask him to put her name on the deed or anything. \n\nOP wants the girlfriend to move in. The girlfriend doesn\u2019t feel comfortable moving into the house where she has no power and can have any decision vetoed with \u201cI paid for it\u201d.\n\nThe girlfriend suggests the compromise where they rent a new place together. It is OP\u2019s right to refuse the idea. But so is the girlfriend\u2019s right refuse moving in with him.\n\nOP\u2019s comments are a huge red flag here. Yes, it is his right to decide what happens with and in house. But he is definitely the controlling one for wanting his girlfriend to move in without having any power within the house.\n\nAs for fianc\u00e9/girlfriend, again, I must ask, at what point do you consider a person an equal in relationship? Because your insistence here makes it sound like you consider girlfriends to be inferior sort of relationship.", "If you had a house, I can understand not wanting to leave it but that isn\u2019t the point. The gf isn\u2019t comfortable moving in because she would have less of an equal say. Even if you think that\u2019s okay because he owns the house, it\u2019s also compelling okay for her not want to be in that situation. Remember, he is the one insisting that she moves in with him. It\u2019s not a comparable relationship and the op is 100% the asshole. He even stated that her family could never visit because it\u2019s not her house, it\u2019s his.", "You\u2019re obviously making this a sexist thing. Even though I mentioned multiple times that the same would apply if roles where reversed. See ya", "I am just pointing out your weird tendency to emphasise the whole \u201cgirlfriend\u201d thing. But good on you avoiding that issue of yours.\n\nI am sure it helps you deal with your everyday problems quite well.\n\nEdit: Man, I must have hit the nerve seeing that the guy replied something and then blocked me. Cute.\n\nThen again, some people just want to feel like they got the last word in. Even if that word is some pathetic whining."]}
