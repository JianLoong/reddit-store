Yeah, he sickens me\u2026", "NTA by a million.\n\n>nd told me I can\u2019t just expect him to babysit while i go out and have a good time\n\nYou didn't ask him to babysit. Babysitting is when you watch someone *elses* kids. You don't babysit your own kids, that's called *parenting*.

My best friend wanted to go out with his wife and couldn't get a babysitter no one wanted to watch them. I went to his house Friday afternoon and picked up his son and daughter. Around the same age as your girls. And then told them this weekend these kids are mine fuck off!!! And left. All the way across the street. To them to my gaming movie room. And sat in my recliner and they play Wii and Wii u and watched Disney plus. Had grill cheese sandwichs and pizzas and let them use my paints and markers. \n\nMy daughter came down to hang out and play with them. People need to engage in their kids upbringing. People need to understand that a father AND mother have responsibilities. It's not hard to watch over your own kids or others. You have to reach out and make a connection. Instead of looking at you for direction let them decide. \n\nNow your husband doesn't respect you or even loves his children. You need to leave. The only way to make a statement is by demanding things from him. Don't do his laundry. Don't clean up after him. Scream until he cleans. Be up his ass. After work start texting him hey where are you?? Call his work and ask what's time is he coming. Nag his ass. Tell him he has this weekend with the kids alone because you're leaving to go shave your butt. And get your nails done. \n\nIf he refuses then leave. Take half and child support.

NTA", "y t a for putting up with this behaviour. If he's not coparenting or supporting you in the home why are you still married? \n\nYou're already a single parent, you just need to make it official. Why can he go out every day. Why does he not mind his own kids? Why is he not helping around the house. Time to stop doing anything for your master, sorry husband. No cooking, laundry, if he's not home straight after work get a sitter. \n\nTime to stop being a doormat. Is this what you want for your girls? To end up with a man like this?

I don\u2019t know what to tell you. I\u2019m so sorry.", "I'm going to go ESH. \n\nTo me, this does seem like a lack of communication more than anything.   While it sounds like you do far more for the child in general, I do think that this is the type of thing that needs to be clearly communicated, and possibly reminded. \n\nAnd I say that as a guy with lots of friends with kids.  I know its a pain for them to get out and do stuff solo.  But I also know that they don't just tell their wife 1 time and then just leave.
