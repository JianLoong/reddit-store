I do everything everyday and when my husband gets home he eats, watches tv and falls asleep. I haven\u2019t had a full day to myself since my youngest was born, I really need a break from all this madness.\n\nWell, the other day my friend called me and asked if I wanted to go have lunch with her, then go shopping and maybe go for a drink or two. I was extremely excited and couldn\u2019t wait to just chill for the first time in ages. I told my husband and he didn\u2019t seem to care that much so I assumed it would be okay and he would watch the kids. Well, the day came and as i was leaving my husband stopped me and asked when the babysitter would be here, i told him there was no sitter and he would have to watch them, he went insane on me and told me I can\u2019t just expect him to babysit while i go out and have a good time, he told me that unless i find someone to watch the girls I couldn\u2019t go.

As a husband of an amazing woman who also works her tail off doing many of the same things day in and day out for our 2 kids (8F and 5M), I'm honestly a bit shocked at his response. You weren't expecting him to \"babysit\" his children, you were asking him to *parent* his children for a few hours.

Assuming he wanted your children, then you could and should expect him to do his job and be a father sometimes. Either he mans up and looks after the kids or HE can call a babysitter. How is all things children your solo-gig? And now HE is throwing a tantrum because you expected him to be a responsible adult and look after the children he has with you? I don't want to sound rude, but there are several, colossal red flags in the room here.", "NTA I was like this did absolutely everything for kids/husband cooked, cleaned, worked, washing, school runs, shopping runs, I mean everything without getting so much as 10 mins to myself my ex also would never watch out child so I could have a catch up with friends I would have to take her with me.

He moves in with her and he is shocked to his core to realize that even SHE expected him to clean up after himself and when our kids were over there to visit \"she wouldn't even help [him] by watching our kids for a few minutes\" while he gave the little one a bath. On another day she \"wouldn't even cook her kids lunch\" when he just got home! \"Literally just walked in the door & she handed me her baby and said what's for lunch! What has she been doing all day? They aren't my kids!\" So at her house he has to work all day and take care of HER kids the minute he walks in the door.
