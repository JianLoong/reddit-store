I didn\u2019t have any problems with it, especially because he wouldn\u2019t be taking his own vehicle to grab food. \n\nI had other errands to take care of but I agreed anyways. He asked me for the time I was getting home. I said that I wasn\u2019t too sure but I would be home as fast as I can. I told him all the things I needed to get done and why I wouldn\u2019t be able to give him an exact time. We go back and forth about it and I get frustrated because I was already feeling I\u2019ll and him nagging me overwhelmed me.\n\n*****Important info: my husband has this thing where he needs to know exact numbers for things. Except he\u2019ll be so rigid about it that if I\u2019m off on the figure I give him, he would get upset and say things like  how I don\u2019t know how to manage time, or that I\u2019m unreliable when giving times. I was hesitant to tell him \u201cI\u2019ll be home in an hour\u201d and then when an hour passes by he\u2019ll be calling me to ask where I am, and why I\u2019m not home yet etc etc. This is why I was very frustrated and overwhelmed *****\n\nI come home 2 hours later and find that he drove his car drunk around the neighborhood. I know this because by the time I came home he was no where to be found. He came home about 20 minutes after me. When he arrives home I can see that he\u2019s in bad mood. I still tried to be nice. I do this constantly during the encounter. I asked him what was going on, how much he had to drink, if he was okay, and why was he driving. I\u2019m upset and I feel rightfully so, because he could have killed someone with the level of alcohol he was intoxicated with and DRIVING. He stumbles in the kitchen, falls on the floor.\n\nSo he stumbles up to our bedroom, comes back down after 5 minutes and says \u201cThis house is so f\u2014 ing depressing\u201d I feel like he\u2019s saying that to rile me up, and honestly I\u2019m ignoring him. I\u2019m eating some of the food I brought home, he says \u201call you care about is that food\u201d \n\nMore time goes by, and he starts throwing up in the kitchen sink crying about how he\u2019s needed help for hours how He needs me to take care of him now and I won\u2019t do anything to help him. After throwing up. He cleans some of his mess up, and collapses on the couch saying that I wasn\u2019t here for him. How he needed me for hours and how hungry he is and I haven\u2019t done anything about it. I ask him what he wants me to do and he says \u201cthe fact that you even have to ask is f ked up\u201d\n\nI told him where the food was and to grab a popsicle if he was going to throw up again. I then told him I would talk to him when he wasn\u2019t drunk because it doesn\u2019t make sense to reason with a drunk person.

Please rethink staying together.", "NTA - and your husband sounds immature and irresponsible. He is 28 years old, he knows better than to drive drunk and that it is not your responsibility to drop everything because he decided to get wasted. \n\nAlso he sounds quite rude and self absorbed. Is this a one off or does this happen frequently? (Blaming you for his bad choices and getting angry when you don\u2019t read his mind and pick up the slack?

If you think it will take one hour, tell him two hours.  This way you have wiggle room and he has no excuse.  If he whines about how long it will take, say \"sorry\" then hang up.  Don't answer his calls after that.  It will give you the upper hand.  When you get home and he demands to k ow why you didn't answer, tell him you already knew what he was going to say and you needed to focus on driving.", "NTA. He sounds like he needs rehab or aa.

You're right. It's impossible to reason with someone who is drunk. At least he did seem compelled to pick a fight.\n\nThe next time that he presses you for an exact ETA on anything,  do what the airlines do: provide an extremely generous amount of time for yourself so that, no matter when you get home, you're always on time.", "NTA. Toddlers shouldn't be drinking and your hubby sounds like one. \"Relaxing and having fun\" shouldn't include drinking and driving because you didn't jump to do his bidding when he snapped his fingers.

Drunk driving literally kills people. It's inexcusable, and I wouldn't have any sympathy for him after that.\n\nOn top of that he drunkenly compares himself being drunk (something he chose to do) to you being sick.

Get out while you can, assuming you can't get him to agree to stop drinking.\n\nI'm not talking about weekend warriors or casual/ occasional drinkers. This post is full of red flags:\n\nDrinking without a plan. Demanding his wife fetch him food. *CHOOSING to drive drunk (100%unacceptable)*. Gaslighting and using abusive language when you got home.

Good luck.", "Sorry \u201chow hungry he is and I haven\u2019t done anything about it\u201d, we are talking about a grown adult right?\nHow entitled do you have to be to get into a car incredibly drunk, risk the lives of countless people for your own selfish self-inflicted situation? It sounds like he may be depressed and using alcohol to cope but that does not give him the right to 1) drink and drive 2) treat you like rubbish. NTA", "NTA. Your husband sounds like an alcoholic child. Why are you putting up with this??", "NTA \n\nPeople who drink and drive don't deserve any sympathy. \n\nLeave for the night (with his car keys), let him lay in a pool of his own vomit and tell him you'll come home when it's all cleaned up.", "You\u2019re not wrong, he is\u2026he should be taking care of you, because you were sick. My opinion though.", "NTA. There's some serious issues going on here. Drink driving is SERIOUS and it's super concerning that he did it casually and then didn't even mention it. He seems to have a drinking problem, drinking at home alone to the point of collapsing on the couch and being physically sick - especially in circumstances where he knows his unwell wife is on the way home and might need looking after. \n\nYour husband sounds like he may have some neurodivergence in relation to the number/time quirk. You should try and be patient with him at least until you guys can work out what's going on there. He might do well with some therapy/support. I'm not going to go all armchair psychologist but there's some diagnoses that stand out as possibilities. If it's something that's impeding his/your life, he should definitely look more into it if comfortable doing so.\n\nThat doesn't excuse the drinking, DUI, or generally thoughtless behaviour towards you, but just something to keep in mind going forward. In the meantime, don't blame you at all for walking away from this situation. It was the right thing to do.", "NTA - If he was so fucking hungry and just couldn't want couldn't he just order through DoorDash? And if he didn't have the means, and you didn't mind couldn't he just... IDK... Ask you and say he'd pay you back? You were busy buy nice enough to say you'd pick up food. He's a grown man and can fend for himself for 2 hours at least.\r  \n\r  \nDrinking and driving is incredibly selfish and he is lucky he didn't kill anyone or himself. I hope he comes to realize he was the ass, and not you, and you have a life that doesn't revolve around him.", "NTA, he's a narcissistic alcoholic.", "Alcohol is a poison.

This isn't a healthy relationship.", "This sounds like the beginning of an alcohol problem, and it's very likely that he is attempting to make you his enabler. If this is new behaviour, then you need to nip it in the bud now, or it will get worse.\n\nHave a serious conversation with him when he is sober and ask him to speak to his doctor about getting help with his alcohol issues. He may also be using the alcohol to mask a mental health condition, depression is a very common reason people turn to alcohol and it destroys lives.", "NTA visit r/alanon \n\nGo to a meeting.  This is going to sound super harsh, but when I went to a meeting and saw what others had put up with for decades, I realized I loved myself a hell of a lot more than my ex and wasn\u2019t going to become one of the long-timers.", "Just one question: why on Earth are you with this person?", "I feel like there is A LOT to unpack here and it\u2019s likely above the Reddit pay grade.  There\u2019s at the very least binge drinking disorder if not alcoholism, mental health issues, manipulation and guilt behaviors, relationship stress, and we could go on.  Please follow the advice of other posters and seek out counseling whether your husband will join you as a couple or you go on your own.  Be well.", "NTA. Would truly rather die alone than be with someone like your pathetic husband. No offense. \n\nHow do you still love and respect him after seeing who he truly is? Could not be me.", "These are not episodes. These are bad choices he\u2019s making on purpose. He sounds like an emotional abusive alcoholic. Why should you put more effort in taking care of him if he doesn\u2019t make choices to take care of himself. Set a boundary and if he keeps this up, I think you know what you have to do. Something will have to change.", "Oh, it's only going to get worse. My husband was an angry, mean drunk who would pick fights with me just so he felt like he was in control. When it was happening it only escalated, this is a black hole.", "He sounds like an abusive alcoholic. I would advise you to leave ASAP", "What your husband wants is for you to be his mummy. He is acting like a child and emotionally abusing you over hid weaponised incompetence. I'd be asking myself if this person & relationship makes me happy. That is not a partner at all and I'm sorry that he's convincing you that you're at fault.", "OK- you need to realize he isn't mean when he's drunk, he drinks so he can be mean.  He wants to berate you, as evidence by the fact that he freaks out if you are a minute off in your time estimates, and he knows if he is drunk he has an 'excuse' so he lets go. \n\n This guy enjoys making you feel bad.  There just isn't any way to make two people in a relationship happy if one of them likes to hurt the other (mentally, emotionally or physically).  He is an alcoholic, clearly very self centered and people are going to get hurt, maybe killed if he thinks drunk driving is a good way to upset you.  He doesn't care about hurting innocent people on the road, but he knows you will, so I bet it's going to escalate whenever you don't act like his on call emotional support animal and PA.", "\u201cepisodes\u201d    He is an abusive alcoholic \n\nCall it what you want it doesn\u2019t change the result.  \n\nThere are support groups for family members of alcoholics. They can help you with the issues your facing and will also have resources to help you however that looks. You don\u2019t need to stay in an abusive situation. \n\nCall your local police to report drunk driving next time. Him killing someone will not help his sobriety or your relationship.", "Babe, I have been there. You don\u2019t have to live like this. Leave him; you\u2019ll be so much happier on the other side.", "Also car repairs, increases in car insurance, hospital bills, funeral expenses, and lawsuits. Like just getting a DUI would be a lucky outcome.", "Drunks have to take care of themselves at home. There is no winning with them . NTA.", "NTA\n\nThis man is endangering everyone around him. Driving drunk is abhorrent, selfish and criminal. He clearly only did it to punish you for a perceived slight. In the short term, remove his keys and yours so that he can't drive whilst still drunk. In the long term' please think about how to safely extricate yourself from him.\n\nHis behaviour is abusive and extremely manipulative, trying to paint you as the villain of his self-inflicted situation. He is clearly doing this to control how you behave, and the fact that you have refused to behave as wants you to means that he will look for other ways to control you, and that may mean escalating. Instead of purposely harming himself (and putting others at risk) to control you, he may harm you directly. Stay safe.", "Just leave him, jesus christ, it's so simple", "NTA. \n\nHave a look at Al-Anon. It\u2019s a support group for the loved ones of people who misuse alcohol.", "NTA.  Is your husband always like this, or is he just sad, bad and narcissistic drunk?", "NTA Hubby seems to be quite the CRY baby.  Best to rethink your sitch.", "This story was legit like seven different flavours of \"oh HELL no\" all spun up into one WTF milkshake. To use the classic test: OP, what would you say to someone you cared about who was dealing with this BS?", "You are NTA.\n\nHowever, you are in a relationship with an alcoholic.\n\nI'm not going to say if you should stay in this relationship or not (that's up to you) but I recommend that YOU attend Al-Anon meetings to learn how to cope being in a relationship with an alcoholic.", "This times 100000000000000!! It never gets better. Never. It sounds like he causes you fear daily OP and that is absolutely no way to live. Life is too short. I know this because a drunken partner once shoved his thumbs under my collar bones and lifted me up off the floor by them. He did this while drunk. It all started with the exact behavior you are describing. RUN NOW!"]}
