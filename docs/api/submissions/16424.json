He was already drinking at this time and said that he was \u201chaving fun and relaxing\u201d since he doesn\u2019t have to work the next day. I didn\u2019t have any problems with it, especially because he wouldn\u2019t be taking his own vehicle to grab food. \n\nI had other errands to take care of but I agreed anyways. He asked me for the time I was getting home. I said that I wasn\u2019t too sure but I would be home as fast as I can. I told him all the things I needed to get done and why I wouldn\u2019t be able to give him an exact time. We go back and forth about it and I get frustrated because I was already feeling I\u2019ll and him nagging me overwhelmed me.\n\n*****Important info: my husband has this thing where he needs to know exact numbers for things. Except he\u2019ll be so rigid about it that if I\u2019m off on the figure I give him, he would get upset and say things like  how I don\u2019t know how to manage time, or that I\u2019m unreliable when giving times. I was hesitant to tell him \u201cI\u2019ll be home in an hour\u201d and then when an hour passes by he\u2019ll be calling me to ask where I am, and why I\u2019m not home yet etc etc. This is why I was very frustrated and overwhelmed *****\n\nI come home 2 hours later and find that he drove his car drunk around the neighborhood. I know this because by the time I came home he was no where to be found. He came home about 20 minutes after me. When he arrives home I can see that he\u2019s in bad mood. I still tried to be nice. I do this constantly during the encounter. I asked him what was going on, how much he had to drink, if he was okay, and why was he driving. I\u2019m upset and I feel rightfully so, because he could have killed someone with the level of alcohol he was intoxicated with and DRIVING. He stumbles in the kitchen, falls on the floor.\n\nSo he stumbles up to our bedroom, comes back down after 5 minutes and says \u201cThis house is so f\u2014 ing depressing\u201d I feel like he\u2019s saying that to rile me up, and honestly I\u2019m ignoring him. I\u2019m eating some of the food I brought home, he says \u201call you care about is that food\u201d \n\nMore time goes by, and he starts throwing up in the kitchen sink crying about how he\u2019s needed help for hours how He needs me to take care of him now and I won\u2019t do anything to help him. After throwing up. He cleans some of his mess up, and collapses on the couch saying that I wasn\u2019t here for him. How he needed me for hours and how hungry he is and I haven\u2019t done anything about it. I ask him what he wants me to do and he says \u201cthe fact that you even have to ask is f ked up\u201d\n\nI told him where the food was and to grab a popsicle if he was going to throw up again. I then told him I would talk to him when he wasn\u2019t drunk because it doesn\u2019t make sense to reason with a drunk person. He called me uncaring before I left.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683261122, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/138aou3/aita_for_leaving_my_drunk_husband_m_28_to_take/", "score": 33, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you have to ask this to   Convince yourself you are not, its time for therapy or a support group to regain your self confidence. Mean drunks get meaner. Please rethink staying together.", "NTA - and your husband sounds immature and irresponsible. He is 28 years old, he knows better than to drive drunk and that it is not your responsibility to drop everything because he decided to get wasted. \n\nAlso he sounds quite rude and self absorbed. Is this a one off or does this happen frequently? (Blaming you for his bad choices and getting angry when you don\u2019t read his mind and pick up the slack? And drinking heavily and being an AH?)", "NTA\n\nHubby was being manipulative, a trait often found in alcoholics.  Don't reward the behavior by giving him a response.  Rather focus on your food, a tv show, a game app, whatever.  He'll try every trick in the book but he will give up.\n\nIn the future, under promise- over deliver.  If you think it will take one hour, tell him two hours.  This way you have wiggle room and he has no excuse.  If he whines about how long it will take, say \"sorry\" then hang up.  Don't answer his calls after that.  It will give you the upper hand.  When you get home and he demands to k ow why you didn't answer, tell him you already knew what he was going to say and you needed to focus on driving.", "NTA. He sounds like he needs rehab or aa. Driving drunk is inexcusable, especially in an area where there are kids running around. Sounds like it\u2019s time for an ultimatum. He either gets help or gets a divorce.", "I don\u2019t know how you could type this all up and still wonder at all if you might be in the wrong at all in this situation. I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re going through this with your husband. Imo you should tell him that if he ever behaves like that again you\u2019re just not going to deal with him anymore.", "NTA\n\nHe\u2019s the AH for:\n- demanding an exact arrival time when you didn\u2019t know how long each errand would take\n- going back and forth about it instead of accepting that you couldn\u2019t be specific\n- DRIVING WHILE DRUNK\n- stating that \u2018all you care about is food\u2019 when he hassled you that whole time about food, without any sense of irony\n- insisting you should have helped him for hours\n- being passive aggressive when you asked how you could help\n- calling you uncaring while not once in this exchange asking how *you* were feeling despite you not having been feeling well, again without any sense of irony.", "NTA.  You're right. It's impossible to reason with someone who is drunk. At least he did seem compelled to pick a fight.\n\nThe next time that he presses you for an exact ETA on anything,  do what the airlines do: provide an extremely generous amount of time for yourself so that, no matter when you get home, you're always on time.", "NTA. Toddlers shouldn't be drinking and your hubby sounds like one. \"Relaxing and having fun\" shouldn't include drinking and driving because you didn't jump to do his bidding when he snapped his fingers. He could've gone and gotten his own food BEFORE he started drinking if it was that important or he was that hungry.", "NTA. Break up with anyone who drives drunk. His alcohol addiction doesn\u2019t have to be your problem", "Sounds like he is depressed and has alcohol problems. Get him help. Trust me, I know how to spot it from dealing with this with my wife. Don't let it go too much further or it's really hard to come back from. NTA", "NTA - he sounds insanely toxic and sounds like he\u2019s very controlling. It\u2019s a red flag when they have to know where you are constantly and asking constantly when you are going to be home. You definitely need to talk to him about these issues when he\u2019s sober because this doesn\u2019t sound okay at all", "NTA\n\nWhy on earth are you married to this guy? He's obviously a drunk. Things will only get worse in time.\n\nYou have a job, so you're not financially dependent on him. Divorce and make a better life for yourself!", "NTA\n\nExpecting you to give an exact time is unreasonable to start. You don't know how long your chores will take or what traffic will be like. He should know this, he lives in the same world as everyone else and can't predict things down to the minute  himself, he shouldn't expect you to.\n\nHim driving drunk is the biggest problem, obviously. Drunk driving literally kills people. It's inexcusable, and I wouldn't have any sympathy for him after that.\n\nOn top of that he drunkenly compares himself being drunk (something he chose to do) to you being sick. If he can't drink responsibily by himself he shouldn't drink by himself at all, you can't drop everything you're doing to babysit him.\n\nI hope he comes to his senses and apologises when he's sobered up.", "NTA: sounds like he needs actual help OP. But at the end of the day, he\u2019s grown and you\u2019re not his mom.", "NTA\n\nHis situation is entirely self-inflicted. If he can't look after himself, he shouldn't start drinking.", "Please look into Al-Anon. They have resources for dealing with alcoholic family members. There will be other people dealing with this issue that can help you. Alcoholism runs in my family, and I also had a partner who acted similarly and I stayed with him FOR YEARS. You\u2019re NTA but you need support to figure out the next steps. Also, not everyone acts as horribly as your man when he\u2019s drunk. That behavior is really bad. Seek help, please!", "I'm guessing this isn't a one-off?  He drinks like this regularly?  You need to set boundaries- now. Living with an alcoholic is exhausting and depressing. Get out while you can, assuming you can't get him to agree to stop drinking.\n\nI'm not talking about weekend warriors or casual/ occasional drinkers. This post is full of red flags:\n\nDrinking without a plan. Demanding his wife fetch him food. *CHOOSING to drive drunk (100%unacceptable)*. Gaslighting and using abusive language when you got home. Barfing in the sink. \n\nI hope this is just some random night that got away from him, but if this is a pattern, you've got trouble. NTA. Good luck.", "Sorry \u201chow hungry he is and I haven\u2019t done anything about it\u201d, we are talking about a grown adult right?\nHow entitled do you have to be to get into a car incredibly drunk, risk the lives of countless people for your own selfish self-inflicted situation? It sounds like he may be depressed and using alcohol to cope but that does not give him the right to 1) drink and drive 2) treat you like rubbish. NTA", "NTA. Your husband sounds like an alcoholic child. Why are you putting up with this??", "NTA \n\nPeople who drink and drive don't deserve any sympathy. \n\nLeave for the night (with his car keys), let him lay in a pool of his own vomit and tell him you'll come home when it's all cleaned up.", "You\u2019re not wrong, he is\u2026he should be taking care of you, because you were sick. My opinion though.", "NTA. There's some serious issues going on here. Drink driving is SERIOUS and it's super concerning that he did it casually and then didn't even mention it. He seems to have a drinking problem, drinking at home alone to the point of collapsing on the couch and being physically sick - especially in circumstances where he knows his unwell wife is on the way home and might need looking after. \n\nYour husband sounds like he may have some neurodivergence in relation to the number/time quirk. You should try and be patient with him at least until you guys can work out what's going on there. He might do well with some therapy/support. I'm not going to go all armchair psychologist but there's some diagnoses that stand out as possibilities. If it's something that's impeding his/your life, he should definitely look more into it if comfortable doing so.\n\nThat doesn't excuse the drinking, DUI, or generally thoughtless behaviour towards you, but just something to keep in mind going forward. In the meantime, don't blame you at all for walking away from this situation. It was the right thing to do.", "NTA - If he was so fucking hungry and just couldn't want couldn't he just order through DoorDash? And if he didn't have the means, and you didn't mind couldn't he just... IDK... Ask you and say he'd pay you back? You were busy buy nice enough to say you'd pick up food. He's a grown man and can fend for himself for 2 hours at least.\r  \n\r  \nDrinking and driving is incredibly selfish and he is lucky he didn't kill anyone or himself. I hope he comes to realize he was the ass, and not you, and you have a life that doesn't revolve around him.", "NTA, he's a narcissistic alcoholic.", "Alcohol is a poison.  He poisoned himself and then whined for you to take care of him.  I would\u2019t live like that, but you do you.  NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also, he needs to be able to get good delivered, especially when he knows you are busy.\n\nThat said, I'm not sure about the whole time thing. I would need info. It's because I absolutely hate it if every time someone says half an hour and then it becomes 2 hours. I feel my time isn't valued.

The least you should accept if you want to continue with him, is him by himself admitting he have issue, and take real actions to tackle them.

Start by ringing one of the DV hotlines - I know you'll say to yourself 'this isn't DV', but it's the beginning of coercive control, which really is, and the drinking has the potential to spiral out of control fast.

He was off work before you and has tomorrow off, he should be helping you with errands, or at least picking up food for both of you. You are also sick and could use someone to take care of you, the difference is he got sick by choice. I'm seeing a lot of red flags in this behavior but only you will truly know which ones are ongoing issues, however the thing about needing exact times and getting mad sounds really controlling. Even if this is a one time thing, he went driving for no reason, he didn't even go get food he just went for a drunk joy ride, your husband does need help but not in the way he thinks. He wants help as in you being his mom, what he needs is professional help.", "NTA. Man, your husband sounds difficult at times. It seems like either way, you were in a losing situation.
