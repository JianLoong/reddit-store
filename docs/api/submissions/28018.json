She aspirated water into her lungs causing an infection (Pneumonia) and had to be intubated and sedated for 4 days, including catheter and all kinds of tests. She had just woken up at about 1pm and was very confused and hallucinating slightly from the anesthesia. So, I wanted someone here she knows to keep her company and help her instead of a stranger. This conversation started at 12:30am on day3 Friday night in to Saturday morning.\n\nMe: Can you and/or FIL stay with Spouse tomorrow between 3 and midnight till I get off work? Idk if they are gonna try to wake up her not but she\u2019s having the mri tomorrow. And her lungs are getting better so hopefully they can.\n\nShe messages back 12:40PM on Saturday:\n\nMIL: FIL will be back from town soon and I will see what he wants to do I'll get back with you very soon. (Next text) I will be there at 3:00\n\nI then receive this message at 3:08pm\n\nMIL: I'm about to leave and take FIL the car so he can go to the hospital he'll be there about 4:30.\n\nMe: Wtf alright. I really need one of you here by 430, I cannot afford to miss another day of work. (Spouse can\u2019t work due to seizures)\n\nNo response until 5:35pm\u2026\nMIL: FIL is about to head that way.\n\nMe: Lol if he doesn\u2019t want to he doesn\u2019t have to, I just need to know so I can call my boss. I\u2019m 2 hours late already and it\u2019s probably gonna be another hour till he gets here. (It was)\n\nMIL: He just left. You don't have to wait on him to go to work I don't know what you're mad about but you don't have to wait on FIL for you to go to work you could have already gone to work. He left he\u2019s on his way. \n\nMe: Yes I do have to wait because your daughter can\u2019t take care of herself, I\u2019m feeding her, draining mucus out of mouth, I\u2019m mad because you told me 3, then 430, then at 530 you say he\u2019s leaving? It\u2019s very frustrating.\n\nMIL: She has nurses there as well. If you were not there that's what they get paid for as well. Do you think they would just let her be alone with no care. No reason for your frustrations. He had to wait for me to get back to take the car I left Granddaughter\u2019s birthday party early so he could. So I would appreciate you not being that way to us because we've been down this road we know what happens in the in the hospital. You have choices people still have to work and they still have to do things and he is on his Way. I'm not going to argue with you. He is on his way.\n\nMe: Lol people do have to work, no reason for my frustration???you could\u2019ve told me you were at a  party, or at least updated me along the way but whatever cool thanks bye.\n\nMIL: I don't appreciate your tone. I gave you a time frame and he's on his way.\n\n(FIL also wasn\u2019t there when I got off work, no telling when he left.)\n\nI just sent her a thumbs up emoji after that.

My own parents can be like your in laws. \n\nI had heart surgery and was in recovery. I was a teenager. My parents left the hospital, and left me alone, to go to a football game because \u201cthere is nothing we can do to help the situation.\u201d \n\nI will never forget that they left me like that. \n\nWhen things have calmed down and your wife has recovered more, you need to discuss with her what happened. I wouldn\u2019t give the in laws any updates or information on how your wife is doing until you talk with your wife and set new boundaries. Your in laws have shown you who they are as people, believe them. This will continue to be an issue moving forward. Make sure you and your wife have documents in place like an advance directive and a will. Make sure MIL/FIL have no say in anything, as they clearly don\u2019t care.", "NTA, seriously? Even my mother would show if I was in ICU, and she doesn\u2019t gaf about most things parents care about. Band performances? Nope. Hospital? Yes, the moment she\u2019s asked. \n\nAnd yeah, the ICU nurses and techs will take care of her, but there\u2019s eff all they can do about hospital delirium. A family member in the room is super helpful for that, because there\u2019s already a relationship of trust there. \n\nI hope your wife continues to improve. My husband had hospital delirium for his entire inpatient stay after bypass surgery, and it was basically resolved when we hit our front door, so she should be okay on that front.", "NTA\n\nAfter reading your comments, my only question is, what's wrong with them?", "NTA- you had to beg her own parents to visit her during a 4 day critical care hospital stay. And they couldn't even do that right. It's pretty obvious who the asshole is. \n\nYour poor wife. Hope they find a good treatment for her soon.", "NTA\n\nMy daughter is intubated in ICU \u2026 lets go to a party first! Wtf", "NTA. Also, as an ICU nurse, I CANNOT just sit in one patient\u2019s room all day. Not going to happen. How awful of her family.", "I don't get the E S H or Y T A, a loved one is in the hospital, that's always a scary and helpless feeling. My niece has seizures and it's terrifying every time, wondering if she'll be ok, if she's going to wake up, if/what she'll remember (regression). Anything can happen while there, so it's nice/comforting to have someone there to take care of them, watch them and give updates.", "You're NTA. Are your in-laws really that dense and self involved,  or just completely in denial about the seriousness of their daughter's condition?\n\nThey are the A-Hs for not be8ng there already, and double royal A-Hs for her saying one of them would be there when they had no intention of being there. MIL is also a Super king kong mega A-H for going to a birthday party when her daughter is so ill", "NTA, if she couldn't be there at 3 that's one thing, but jerking around the timeline on you is not ok. She's also being incredibly blase about the situation. There are things that can be done to reduce ICU induced PTSD.", "NTA and those voting otherwise got this one wrong. If something like that happened to either of my grown children either my wife or I would be there in a heartbeat. My grandchildren would be mad if their grandmother went to their birthday party instead of being at the hospital with their uncle. I don't understand any of the other comments siding with your in-laws.", "NTA when your IL\u2019s are on their deathbed no need to spend time with them or offer care. They think everything is fine as long as they have a nurse on staff. Make sure your wife knows how they treated her once she is recovered.", "These people are for the streets and you are way too nice. I would have given them an earful, starting with \"Wtf is wrong with you?!\". NTA", "NTA. Best wishes to your wife. \n\nGet all your documents together for medical power of attorney, first you then another person not her parents. They are useless. Lying to you and copping an attitude when you as well as your wife needed instant agreement and cooperation. \ud83d\ude21\n\nMy uncle didn\u2019t go see his mother in her final hospitalization because \u201che doesn\u2019t like hospitals.\u201d  She passed without a final chance to talk with him. I do not understand people like that.", "NTA completely. What is wrong with these people?!\n\nMy EX FIL was in the ICU after a motorcycle crash. My parents went and sat in his hospital room so Ex-MIL could go home, shower, etc. This was after a nasty divorce, too. My parents said- they\u2019re our grandson\u2019s other grandparents. Of course we\u2019re going to help. \n\nYour in-laws are shitty people. I\u2019m sorry, and I hope your wife is back to 100% healthy very soon!", "NTA. My mom was deep in Alzheimer's and didn't know one day from the next. But when she found out I was in the hospital and had had surgery, she hounded my husband and our housemate until the brought her up to the hospital to see me.", "NTA. But you\u2019ve learned that a bday party was more important than their daughter.", "NTA. Your 23 year old daughter is in the hospital with a serious illness and you are concerned about a birthday party? I don\u2019t care whether my children get married or not, they will always be my babies and I will be there when they need me.", "NTA. You were not being unreasonable in your request for one of your wife\u2019s parents to spend some time at her hospital bedside to ensure there was a familiar face waiting for her when she wakes up. I can\u2019t imagine not being their for my child.", "WTF is wrong with those people? As a mom, I'd be there right away and you'd have to fight me to get me to leave.You need all the help and support you can get to allow you to care for your wife! You, sir, are definitely NTA! I hope your wife improves soon.", "As overloaded as healthcare workers are all you absolutely need a family member there almost 24 / 7 if they\u2019re at all critical. Nothing against them, but it\u2019s a crazy time.", "NTA. They don't care and a party is more fun than nursing duty. You know this now, please stop trying to depend on them.", "Absolutely insane\n\nWhen my grandmother was in the hospital my family stayed in shifts: me, my mother, my uncle's, my grandpa. She had hospital delirium terrible and would not sleep for long before waking up disoriented. Someone always spent the night at the hospital and we each took turns to account for work.\n\nHaving family be there to reassure her as well as advocate for her was so helpful. And yes ICU has nurses but there is no nurse there 24/7 at every patient's bedside the same way a family member can be. And. To be frank, we encountered the best and the worst nurses during her stay.\n\nI'm appalled at her own mother's behavior and I would be as outraged as you are. I'm sorry you have been dealing with this on your own and hope your wife has a speedy recovery", "NTA - my mom drove through a blizzard that closed highways to get it to me after I hemorrhaged and died due to childbirth complications. When I woke up from being resuscitated her and my husband were the first things I saw. \n\nHer parents are horrible and I would go no contact with them over this!", "NTA.  Even if it was a stranger in the hospital and not her daughter, the fact is she told you she'd be there at 3 and stay until 12, and that was a lie.  She didn't communicate with you in any sort of respectful way.\n\nNot saying it's right, but people do sometimes get blase about hospitalizations for loved ones when that person has had frequent health issues.  I absolutely don't understand why, but I've seen it multiple times.  I think that you and your wife need to discuss a different plan of action for the future.  The two of you have been shown you cannot count on your in-laws.", "Jesus. I had a seizure in the summer and when I came to in the hospital my mom was holding my hand while she slept in a chair on her birthday. I\u2019m almost 40..but I cried seeing her and I felt safer in all the confusion.  I hope your spouse gets better soon. Definitely when you think they are able to hear it, talk to them about their parents reactions/non-reaction; and get all your affairs in order. In case (forbid) this happens again and they start trying to bully their way into medical decisions. NTA", "My god, you would not have been able to keep my parents away with a - ok I'm not coming up with a good analogy. But you would not be able to keep them away. I am so very sorry your wife's folks are horrible.", "NTA. It sounds like they don't care about their daughter in the least.", "NTA it\u2019s heartbreaking and absolutely frustrating that they don\u2019t care at all but I have to wonder if this is just the way they are? I\u2019m sure there have been signs that they wouldn\u2019t care and times they have disappointed you and your wife so i would think you should have expected this especially when they didn\u2019t rush over the minute they found out. The fact that you had to work sucks but honestly her parents being there would probably caused more trouble than if you just let the nurses help and let her rest. The whole situation is horrible but maybe you should have called a friend to stay with her, someone who actually would care and provide help", "I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to go through this and deal with their bullshit too.  If you have friends, reach out to them, strangers who actually care are going to be more reassuring than disinterested relatives.  \n\nI hope your wife gets better soon.", "NTA the medical staff always comment on how our family is one of the few that are with their family member, that most patients are by themselves.

Yes nurses/ docs there to help, yes they paid for that & it\u2019s their job BUT it is not their job to make someone feel as comfortable as possible when that person is around strangers in a strange place which means staying uncomfortable till back in one\u2019s own home. She has bad parents.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Well you're in-laws suck. Now you know you cannot depend on them for anything. I would just stop talking to them because they obviously don't give a damn about their daughter. I get they've been through this before but the sounds like it was quite serious. Aspirating is definitely very serious. Given the fact that she has seizures, and repeated ones that that's extremely dangerous as you obviously know. I really hope she has a full recovery and they can find some medication that helps her lessen her seizure activity.", "You have the in-laws from Hell! Can you guys cut contact with them?

Cuz that is like one of very few reasons I can think of that they would do this.", "NTA.\n\nWTF is wrong with her parents?!! Their behavior is completely bizarre.\n\nAnd no, you can't expect nurses to give that level of care.  It isn't the 1960s - all hospitals are understaffed and nurses are often too flat out to give that kind of care anymore.\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb and guess your in-laws have never been there for their daughter.

I hope you are both doing better.", "NTA. \n\nMy mom would have been there the moment I was admitted, is your MIL for real right now?? Does she even care about her daughter?? I'd say you were a great deal more patient than I would have been.", "I'm glad your wife is getting better, that had to be damn scary!  \n\n\nIs the seizure issue a long-standing problem?  I'm wondering if your in-laws are so burned out by ICU stays that they just treat it like a 'normal' event.", "ESH\nYour MIL is right. There are nurses who do all the things you are doing. It is their job. She doesn't need visitors 24/7. That's more something to make you feel better and not guilty about going to work. I actually find it kind of awful when someone is there so much. Like I can't rest as much as I need to because I feel like I need to engage with the people who came to visit. Unfortunately, people who have dealt with stuff like this many many times before build a tolerance to it. It's nothing new and don't freak out. It's a bad tolerance to build.\nHowever, MIL said FIL would be there. Gave you multiple times before finally showing and that is a dick move. I also feel like an ICU trip is a visit a parent should show up to.", "It'll be in the minority, but ESH. Her parents are right: if she's under medical sedation, there is absolutely nothing they can do to help that a nurse couldn't cover for an hour or two. Having family around does typically lead to better care outcomes, but family not being there for an hour, or two, or 6 even, would not have made a *practical* difference.\n\nOn the other hand, situations like that are stressful and chaotic. People handle that in vastly different ways. You handled it by putting everything on hold, potentially your job at risk, to be in the room. They clearly didn't want to spend time in the room with her in that condition. Neither is really more valid than the other when care won't be compromised either way. Some people simply aren't mentally prepared, or capable, to deal with serious illness and forcing them, or guilting them, makes that even less likely to change.\n\nThey should have given you updates, definitely. You should take the obvious avoidance as \"I don't want to be there.\" I'd have a long talk with your wife after she's healed about how she wants to handle it and how she feels. She might have expected them to be like that, maybe she's even ok with them not being there... or maybe she'll be as mad about it as you are and want to cut contact with them. Either way, I'd let her make those choices.", ">we've been down this road we know what happens in the in the hospital.\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nDoes MIL's remark above mean that your spouse has a history of hospitalizations/seizures/etc? If so, your in-laws may not think the current situation is the same level of emergency that you do. Add to that, there is \"care\" at the hospital, patients aren't required to have visitors there 24/7.\n\nI agree it's odd that MIL/FIL have such a laid-back attitude about their daughter's hospitalization. And your MIL shouldn't commit to helping on a schedule she wasn't able to keep.", "Info: are your wife and her parents actually close? Do they live nearby? How often do they speak? There's info missing here \n\nIs your wife expected to recover? Are they the type to avoid hospitals? Do they have a \"Death takes everyone\" view? So much to ask about here and no one is.", "NTA \n\nHowever please know it isn\u2019t required someone be by her side every minute. You need to take care of yourself too. I know it\u2019s scary but the nurses really are there to take care of her.", "Why the LOLs?", "If my wife were in ICU on life support, I would be there 24/7 even if it cost me my job.", "Soft YTA. She is in the hospital you don\u2019t HAVE to be there to care for her, that is what this staff is for. You should have gone to work.", "Not enough info for me. \n\nDaughter is 23...so parents are what, mid 40s-50s.Guarantee one or both also have jobs and it sounds like they share one car. \n\nAlso, we don't know enough about the relationship between the daughter and her parents. My brother and my mom barely speak. \n\nOP are you in the US?

Then be sure and update your wife\u2019s HIPAA info so those who need to are able to relay info.  I definitely would not waste time trying to get support from your wife\u2019s parents. \n\nAnd yes ICU nurses and any floor nurses for that matter are responsible for caring for all patients.

My parents have been called before that I was taken away in an ambulance following a heat stroke (I was in another state for some church thing) and they decided since 3 strangers from the group were there, they didn't need to be. So 15 yrs old me was stuck in a hospital overnight with people I didn't know and I felt more love from them and the doctors/nurses than my own parents. Even recently I developed some stomach issues that led to me not eating for a whole month (could only drink liquids) and I lost 20+lbs. The entire time they just told me to eat more, never cared that I went to the ER 3x (thanks for nothing ER), and honestly didn't care that I was eating or not. I moved out, still have no idea what's wrong but at least I gained some weight back. Not enough but some. \nAll this to say that unfortunately some people are just like your wife's parents.

It would have turned into my family taking care of both of us.  But, she WANTED to.  When my daughter gave birth, I stayed in the room with her and her useless boyfriend so that I could help take care of her and the baby.

I go under general anaesthesia every five weeks or so. Lately, I've started to develop confusion as I wake up. It's awful and so scary. I don't know where I am or what's happening or who anyone is- and this is something that I do often, know the place well, and know the nurses well. I can't speak to ask what's happening and say that I'm scared. Luckily it doesn't last long (maybe 10/15 minutes top), as the procedure is very short and I recover very quickly and the drugs wear off quickly, but when it's happening, it feels like it's going on forever. I've told the nurses about this and they now know to reorientate me a lot, say what's happening and where I am etc. I also talk to the anaesthetist each time before I go under, so they can adjust the medication to help prevent this, or at least make it so I don't remember it. Sometimes it still happens though, and it happened a few times in a row lately.\n\nIn short, it's pretty terrifying. I hate it. It made me start to panic, thinking about the next time I need to have anaesthesia, which I know will need to happen soon. I'm so so glad that last time it didn't happen, as it's made me feel calmer about it. I know that I don't have a choice, that I need this procedure done, but this side effect is really, really awful.\n\nBasically the only thing that's helped is reorientation (telling me where I am etc) and I know that having a nurse that I'm very familiar with is helpful. Last time I had confusion, my favourite nurse was working there (she usually works up on the ward, which I've been on a lot so I know her well and have spend a lot of time with her) and I recognised her voice when she talked to me. I felt comforted. Even though I know the nurses that work in this suite well, I don't recognise a lot of them when I'm waking up and confused.\n\nIt's not possible for me to have a family member when I'm waking up, but I can imagine that it would be incredibly helpful to have someone that I'm close to there. Even if I didn't recognise them properly, it would be very comforting- like when the nurse I knew so well was there.\n\nI'm rambling. What I'm trying to say is it's scary when you're confused after anaesthesia, and I have the benefit of being in an area I know with nurses I know with a light dose of anaesthesia that wears off quickly and I understand what's happening. Your MIL thinks it's fine because there's nurses there. Sure, they might be able to do practical things, but they can't sit with her constantly, telling her it's okay repeatedly. They can be incredibly caring, but they don't know your spouse. Having someone you know there can be a big help.\n\nI will note that there's a big chance your spouse won't remember being confused or any of this, as you are given meds so you don't remember. She might not even be scared like I get. I don't want to scare you! Even if she is confused, chances are she'll forget all of it. However, it will help her at this moment to have someone she knows with her.\n\nAnd even besides all of that, your MIL is just being rude. If you tell someone you're going to be there at 3pm, then be there at 3. Don't message them after 3 telling them you'll be there later. If you're going to be late an HOUR AND A HALF late, then tell them when you realise you'll be late.

She told the cop who pulled her over that my husband was in the hospital and I was stranded at said hospital (I had gotten the wrong vehicle as I was trying to get back to the hospital hubby was at before they transferred him to one an hour away) on the brink of exhaustion so she really needed to get there before I, too, ended up being a patient like my husband. \n\nIn conclusion: \n\nYour wife's parents are shit.

Pretty sure the lol transmitted what he wanted it to.", "They\u2019re in their 40s not their 90s. \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Thank you", "And my reaction at the time and *for years* was \"isn't that a funny story?\" Gosh, that took me a while to realize ... NO. Thanks", "He might have meant when his wife was growing up her grandparents were her legal guardian.", "I agree but theres not many we can rely on, and I figured they\u2019d be the first to say \u201cYeah, of course.\u201d But hey, now I know", "Thank you, exactly. I\u2019m right there with ya, been smoking for years and I would never react this way to my own daughter.", "When my boys were in NICU I was there 24/7. They had to force me to go and sleep. Luckily both are fine now. One only spent 5 days, the other 17 days and both were out patients for years. \n\nMy kids in hospital? that's where you'll find me regardless of my own needs (I'm disabled)", "If you read the OP's comments and not just the original post, she's done some talking (thinking the nurses are talking about her, hence the delirium).  With someone in this serious a condition, it's natural to want a family member to be there at all times.  And the MIL decided to go to a party instead of coming to the hospital, so there's priorities for ya.  I wouldn't worry about her grieving.", "Good for her. Many married couples are in joint plans. When the working spouse\u2019s employment ends, so does the insurance.", "I dunno if you noticed, but there was a pretty major world event in the past few years that significantly reduced the healthcare workforce.", "It\u2019s not super rare. Brains don\u2019t always work right when you\u2019re sick.", "That\u2019s really not safe, holy moly. For the patients and the nurse both. Most we ever put together was two, in the same room, which is *still* not 1:1.", "And for profit hospitals they staff them so they can make you most amount of money off each patient", "Wow. That makes it even more awesome that you did so well", "Exactly! I couldn\u2019t believe it.", "Great explanation.", "Exactly what I thought.", "Undoubtedly! I'm trying to imagine having that attitude with my son. I would be f r e a k i n g the f*** out after about five seconds.", "Maybe, but he said they ARE her guardians.  That\u2019s why I\u2019m confused.", "Pre or post Covid?", "I\u2019m told during treatment for an intentional OD on OTC meds, I attempted to *bite* a very pregnant ER nurse. \ud83d\ude43", "Oh yeah. We know that. But admin is not keen on fixing it.", "That should be in for profit sorry", "They may have medical power of attorney. Often with chronic illness someone does. And she mat have had them before she met husband but choose to leave them as it was easier as they were used to it.", "Just last year I spent multiple nights in the ICU with my family member recovering from major surgery. I believe I was the only one allowed in, they got one person by their side, whatever their relation to them, and no other visitors. We were required to wear masks in the hospital, but part way through the first night, the nurse said I didn't have to wear it in the room. I still put it on around the staff, but yeah. Also, I called family to let them know and went into the hallway. I stayed out of the staff's way and told my family how it went, but as soon as the conversation to turned to other updates in life, the staff told me I couldn't hang out in the hallway, that post-CoVid, it wasn't allowed for the safety of others.\n\nSo no stream of visitors, but I was allowed to come and go as I pleased directly to the room, except at night when they locked the doors and I had to choose to stay in or out.", "My dad passed away in February. He was in the icu for 10 days. We were allowed to stay overnight, which my mom did multiple times. They typically limit visitors to 2 at a time, but the doctors told us that they don\u2019t really care, that it\u2019s up to the nurses. The nurses all said as long as we weren\u2019t in their way, they were fine with us having 4 people in there. I\u2019m very thankful to them for that so that my siblings and I got to be there, along with my mom, whenever we wanted. Maybe it\u2019s because they knew where things were headed, but that\u2019s just my personal, recent experience.", "Pre. However I was the only one allowed all day and night especially since they were both breast fed.", "Oops! I hope you\u2019re feeling better. And don\u2019t worry, we usually know the difference between purposefully aggressive and brain malfunction aggressive.", "report it to the state/CMS. admin know they aren\u2019t allowed to pull that shit. they bank on us not saying anything or reporting them.", "Exactly this.", "You, a singular visitor, not 3 separate visitors (op, mom, dad), we're allowed to stay, I'm assuming you also had medical decision making capabilities for the patient, ie: parent, guardian  or poa?", "My son had a g tube and was heavily sedated, I wasn't allowed to touch him except for diaper changes. I spent as many hours as possible sitting in his room listening to the constant hum and beeping but had to go home at night because I was recovering from a traumatic birth but lived too close (45 minutes) to qualify to stay at the hospital.", "It\u2019s still a struggle but I have better tools all the time! Thankfully the only staff who were crappy to me through my stay were doctors lol.", "I'm curious to know why this matters to you in regards to the OP's account. Clearly, different hospitals and different situations are handled differently depending on your area. OP's wife is evidently allowed to have 24 hour visitors and it sounds like they're only there one at a time; their hospital must allow that. If your experience was different, that's cool and all but why are you so adamant that OP's situation must be an outlier of some kind? Your comments make it sound like you think he's mistaken or something. When people comment that they had a different experience, you double down, asking about their specific relationship with their patient/family member. It's a strange hill to die on. When my MIL was in ICU during Covid, my husband and his siblings all spent time with her, 24/7 - one at a time. None were POA or guardians - they simply relayed her wishes or made decisions they thought she would want. The point is that they were *all* allowed in as long as it was only one at a time. Trust that your experience is unique to you and to whomever was interacting with that hospital at the time you were and that other peoples' experiences are different but still valid and true. I don't see any reason to doubt the OP here, especially in light of how many people are commenting that they've had the same experience.", "I believe I did solely for that visit. There was paperwork right before the surgery to allow it, and the hospital said that for future visits, I'd have to sign it again to have it again. I haven't had PoA over medical decisions since then, nor am I the parent nor guardian.\n\nI was surprised OP would be allowed multiple visitors in the ICU, but again, I can't fully remember whether one more person could visit during the daytime as well, but I was the only one allowed during the nighttime or if I was the only one allowed at all.\n\n>Plus, I've never dealt with any ICU where visitors are allowed 24 hours a day\n\n>I was removed from the room for 2-3 hours a day (precovid).\n\nYour first claim was that no ICU allows visitors 24 hrs and that you, as the parent (The highest possible authority for the child), were even kicked out while your son was in the NICU.\n\nYou're changing your original claim to include an exception, but even in your experience, the exception wasn't allowed to stay. \n\nI'm telling you that I was allowed to stay 24 hrs. Some ICUs allow it. Others do not. Simple as that.", "I'm sorry you had that experience. Both of mine had ng tubes and were fed expressed breast milk. With my oldest I was given a room on the nicu and with my youngest, there wasn't an available room so they gave me a side room on the postpartum floor. It was hard listening to other peoples babies and I found it easier and more calming in the nicu. \n\nThere was very much a sense of de ja vous because both sons had the same nicu nurse (Emma, she was an angel in disguise I'm sure) and both went straight into the same incubator with the same issues, though it was picked up later that my youngest also had heart issues.\n\nI often fell asleep in the chair next to his incubator so I didn't have to go back down to postpartum."]}
