She aspirated water into her lungs causing an infection (Pneumonia) and had to be intubated and sedated for 4 days, including catheter and all kinds of tests. She had just woken up at about 1pm and was very confused and hallucinating slightly from the anesthesia. So, I wanted someone here she knows to keep her company and help her instead of a stranger. This conversation started at 12:30am on day3 Friday night in to Saturday morning.\n\nMe: Can you and/or FIL stay with Spouse tomorrow between 3 and midnight till I get off work? Idk if they are gonna try to wake up her not but she\u2019s having the mri tomorrow. And her lungs are getting better so hopefully they can.\n\nShe messages back 12:40PM on Saturday:\n\nMIL: FIL will be back from town soon and I will see what he wants to do I'll get back with you very soon. (Next text) I will be there at 3:00\n\nI then receive this message at 3:08pm\n\nMIL: I'm about to leave and take FIL the car so he can go to the hospital he'll be there about 4:30.\n\nMe: Wtf alright. I really need one of you here by 430, I cannot afford to miss another day of work. (Spouse can\u2019t work due to seizures)\n\nNo response until 5:35pm\u2026\nMIL: FIL is about to head that way.\n\nMe: Lol if he doesn\u2019t want to he doesn\u2019t have to, I just need to know so I can call my boss. I\u2019m 2 hours late already and it\u2019s probably gonna be another hour till he gets here. (It was)\n\nMIL: He just left. You don't have to wait on him to go to work I don't know what you're mad about but you don't have to wait on FIL for you to go to work you could have already gone to work. He left he\u2019s on his way. \n\nMe: Yes I do have to wait because your daughter can\u2019t take care of herself, I\u2019m feeding her, draining mucus out of mouth, I\u2019m mad because you told me 3, then 430, then at 530 you say he\u2019s leaving? It\u2019s very frustrating.\n\nMIL: She has nurses there as well. If you were not there that's what they get paid for as well. Do you think they would just let her be alone with no care. No reason for your frustrations. He had to wait for me to get back to take the car I left Granddaughter\u2019s birthday party early so he could. So I would appreciate you not being that way to us because we've been down this road we know what happens in the in the hospital. You have choices people still have to work and they still have to do things and he is on his Way. I'm not going to argue with you. He is on his way.\n\nMe: Lol people do have to work, no reason for my frustration???you could\u2019ve told me you were at a  party, or at least updated me along the way but whatever cool thanks bye.\n\nMIL: I don't appreciate your tone. I gave you a time frame and he's on his way.\n\n(FIL also wasn\u2019t there when I got off work, no telling when he left.)\n\nI just sent her a thumbs up emoji after that.

My own parents can be like your in laws. \n\nI had heart surgery and was in recovery. I was a teenager. My parents left the hospital, and left me alone, to go to a football game because \u201cthere is nothing we can do to help the situation.\u201d \n\nI will never forget that they left me like that. \n\nWhen things have calmed down and your wife has recovered more, you need to discuss with her what happened. I wouldn\u2019t give the in laws any updates or information on how your wife is doing until you talk with your wife and set new boundaries. Your in laws have shown you who they are as people, believe them. This will continue to be an issue moving forward. Make sure you and your wife have documents in place like an advance directive and a will. Make sure MIL/FIL have no say in anything, as they clearly don\u2019t care.", "NTA, seriously? Even my mother would show if I was in ICU, and she doesn\u2019t gaf about most things parents care about. Band performances? Nope. Hospital? Yes, the moment she\u2019s asked. \n\nAnd yeah, the ICU nurses and techs will take care of her, but there\u2019s eff all they can do about hospital delirium. A family member in the room is super helpful for that, because there\u2019s already a relationship of trust there. \n\nI hope your wife continues to improve. My husband had hospital delirium for his entire inpatient stay after bypass surgery, and it was basically resolved when we hit our front door, so she should be okay on that front.", "NTA\n\nAfter reading your comments, my only question is, what's wrong with them?", "NTA- you had to beg her own parents to visit her during a 4 day critical care hospital stay. And they couldn't even do that right. It's pretty obvious who the asshole is. \n\nYour poor wife. Hope they find a good treatment for her soon.", "NTA\n\nMy daughter is intubated in ICU \u2026 lets go to a party first! Wtf", "NTA. Also, as an ICU nurse, I CANNOT just sit in one patient\u2019s room all day. Not going to happen. How awful of her family.", "I don't get the E S H or Y T A, a loved one is in the hospital, that's always a scary and helpless feeling. My niece has seizures and it's terrifying every time, wondering if she'll be ok, if she's going to wake up, if/what she'll remember (regression). Anything can happen while there, so it's nice/comforting to have someone there to take care of them, watch them and give updates.", "You're NTA. Are your in-laws really that dense and self involved,  or just completely in denial about the seriousness of their daughter's condition?\n\nThey are the A-Hs for not be8ng there already, and double royal A-Hs for her saying one of them would be there when they had no intention of being there. MIL is also a Super king kong mega A-H for going to a birthday party when her daughter is so ill", "NTA, if she couldn't be there at 3 that's one thing, but jerking around the timeline on you is not ok. She's also being incredibly blase about the situation. There are things that can be done to reduce ICU induced PTSD.", "NTA and those voting otherwise got this one wrong. If something like that happened to either of my grown children either my wife or I would be there in a heartbeat. My grandchildren would be mad if their grandmother went to their birthday party instead of being at the hospital with their uncle. I don't understand any of the other comments siding with your in-laws.", "NTA when your IL\u2019s are on their deathbed no need to spend time with them or offer care. They think everything is fine as long as they have a nurse on staff.

I would have given them an earful, starting with \"Wtf is wrong with you?!\". NTA", "NTA. Best wishes to your wife. \n\nGet all your documents together for medical power of attorney, first you then another person not her parents. They are useless. Lying to you and copping an attitude when you as well as your wife needed instant agreement and cooperation. \ud83d\ude21\n\nMy uncle didn\u2019t go see his mother in her final hospitalization because \u201che doesn\u2019t like hospitals.\u201d  She passed without a final chance to talk with him. I do not understand people like that.", "NTA completely. What is wrong with these people?!\n\nMy EX FIL was in the ICU after a motorcycle crash. My parents went and sat in his hospital room so Ex-MIL could go home, shower, etc. This was after a nasty divorce, too. My parents said- they\u2019re our grandson\u2019s other grandparents. Of course we\u2019re going to help. \n\nYour in-laws are shitty people. I\u2019m sorry, and I hope your wife is back to 100% healthy very soon!", "NTA. My mom was deep in Alzheimer's and didn't know one day from the next. But when she found out I was in the hospital and had had surgery, she hounded my husband and our housemate until the brought her up to the hospital to see me.", "NTA. But you\u2019ve learned that a bday party was more important than their daughter.", "NTA. Your 23 year old daughter is in the hospital with a serious illness and you are concerned about a birthday party? I don\u2019t care whether my children get married or not, they will always be my babies and I will be there when they need me.", "NTA. You were not being unreasonable in your request for one of your wife\u2019s parents to spend some time at her hospital bedside to ensure there was a familiar face waiting for her when she wakes up. I can\u2019t imagine not being their for my child.", "WTF is wrong with those people? As a mom, I'd be there right away and you'd have to fight me to get me to leave.You need all the help and support you can get to allow you to care for your wife! You, sir, are definitely NTA! I hope your wife improves soon.", "As overloaded as healthcare workers are all you absolutely need a family member there almost 24 / 7 if they\u2019re at all critical. Nothing against them, but it\u2019s a crazy time.", "NTA. They don't care and a party is more fun than nursing duty. You know this now, please stop trying to depend on them.", "Absolutely insane\n\nWhen my grandmother was in the hospital my family stayed in shifts: me, my mother, my uncle's, my grandpa. She had hospital delirium terrible and would not sleep for long before waking up disoriented. Someone always spent the night at the hospital and we each took turns to account for work.\n\nHaving family be there to reassure her as well as advocate for her was so helpful. And yes ICU has nurses but there is no nurse there 24/7 at every patient's bedside the same way a family member can be. And. To be frank, we encountered the best and the worst nurses during her stay.\n\nI'm appalled at her own mother's behavior and I would be as outraged as you are. I'm sorry you have been dealing with this on your own and hope your wife has a speedy recovery", "NTA - my mom drove through a blizzard that closed highways to get it to me after I hemorrhaged and died due to childbirth complications. When I woke up from being resuscitated her and my husband were the first things I saw. \n\nHer parents are horrible and I would go no contact with them over this!", "NTA.  Even if it was a stranger in the hospital and not her daughter, the fact is she told you she'd be there at 3 and stay until 12, and that was a lie.  She didn't communicate with you in any sort of respectful way.\n\nNot saying it's right, but people do sometimes get blase about hospitalizations for loved ones when that person has had frequent health issues.  I absolutely don't understand why, but I've seen it multiple times.  I think that you and your wife need to discuss a different plan of action for the future.  The two of you have been shown you cannot count on your in-laws.", "Jesus. I had a seizure in the summer and when I came to in the hospital my mom was holding my hand while she slept in a chair on her birthday. I\u2019m almost 40..but I cried seeing her and I felt safer in all the confusion.  I hope your spouse gets better soon. Definitely when you think they are able to hear it, talk to them about their parents reactions/non-reaction; and get all your affairs in order. In case (forbid) this happens again and they start trying to bully their way into medical decisions. NTA", "My god, you would not have been able to keep my parents away with a - ok I'm not coming up with a good analogy. But you would not be able to keep them away. I am so very sorry your wife's folks are horrible.", "NTA. It sounds like they don't care about their daughter in the least.", "NTA it\u2019s heartbreaking and absolutely frustrating that they don\u2019t care at all but I have to wonder if this is just the way they are? I\u2019m sure there have been signs that they wouldn\u2019t care and times they have disappointed you and your wife so i would think you should have expected this especially when they didn\u2019t rush over the minute they found out. The fact that you had to work sucks but honestly her parents being there would probably caused more trouble than if you just let the nurses help and let her rest. The whole situation is horrible but maybe you should have called a friend to stay with her, someone who actually would care and provide help", "I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re having to go through this and deal with their bullshit too.  If you have friends, reach out to them, strangers who actually care are going to be more reassuring than disinterested relatives.  \n\nI hope your wife gets better soon.", "NTA the medical staff always comment on how our family is one of the few that are with their family member, that most patients are by themselves.

Yes nurses/ docs there to help, yes they paid for that & it\u2019s their job BUT it is not their job to make someone feel as comfortable as possible when that person is around strangers in a strange place which means staying uncomfortable till back in one\u2019s own home. She has bad parents.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Well you're in-laws suck. Now you know you cannot depend on them for anything. I would just stop talking to them because they obviously don't give a damn about their daughter. I get they've been through this before but the sounds like it was quite serious. Aspirating is definitely very serious. Given the fact that she has seizures, and repeated ones that that's extremely dangerous as you obviously know. I really hope she has a full recovery and they can find some medication that helps her lessen her seizure activity.", "You have the in-laws from Hell! Can you guys cut contact with them?

Cuz that is like one of very few reasons I can think of that they would do this.", "NTA.\n\nWTF is wrong with her parents?!! Their behavior is completely bizarre.\n\nAnd no, you can't expect nurses to give that level of care.  It isn't the 1960s - all hospitals are understaffed and nurses are often too flat out to give that kind of care anymore.\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb and guess your in-laws have never been there for their daughter.

I hope you are both doing better.", "NTA. \n\nMy mom would have been there the moment I was admitted, is your MIL for real right now?? Does she even care about her daughter?? I'd say you were a great deal more patient than I would have been.", "I'm glad your wife is getting better, that had to be damn scary!  \n\n\nIs the seizure issue a long-standing problem?  I'm wondering if your in-laws are so burned out by ICU stays that they just treat it like a 'normal' event.", "ESH\nYour MIL is right. There are nurses who do all the things you are doing. It is their job. She doesn't need visitors 24/7. That's more something to make you feel better and not guilty about going to work. I actually find it kind of awful when someone is there so much. Like I can't rest as much as I need to because I feel like I need to engage with the people who came to visit. Unfortunately, people who have dealt with stuff like this many many times before build a tolerance to it. It's nothing new and don't freak out. It's a bad tolerance to build.\nHowever, MIL said FIL would be there. Gave you multiple times before finally showing and that is a dick move. I also feel like an ICU trip is a visit a parent should show up to.", "It'll be in the minority, but ESH. Her parents are right: if she's under medical sedation, there is absolutely nothing they can do to help that a nurse couldn't cover for an hour or two. Having family around does typically lead to better care outcomes, but family not being there for an hour, or two, or 6 even, would not have made a *practical* difference.\n\nOn the other hand, situations like that are stressful and chaotic. People handle that in vastly different ways. You handled it by putting everything on hold, potentially your job at risk, to be in the room. They clearly didn't want to spend time in the room with her in that condition. Neither is really more valid than the other when care won't be compromised either way. Some people simply aren't mentally prepared, or capable, to deal with serious illness and forcing them, or guilting them, makes that even less likely to change.\n\nThey should have given you updates, definitely. You should take the obvious avoidance as \"I don't want to be there.\" I'd have a long talk with your wife after she's healed about how she wants to handle it and how she feels. She might have expected them to be like that, maybe she's even ok with them not being there... or maybe she'll be as mad about it as you are and want to cut contact with them. Either way, I'd let her make those choices.", ">we've been down this road we know what happens in the in the hospital.\n\nESH, Everybody Sucks Here.\n\nDoes MIL's remark above mean that your spouse has a history of hospitalizations/seizures/etc? If so, your in-laws may not think the current situation is the same level of emergency that you do. Add to that, there is \"care\" at the hospital, patients aren't required to have visitors there 24/7.\n\nI agree it's odd that MIL/FIL have such a laid-back attitude about their daughter's hospitalization. And your MIL shouldn't commit to helping on a schedule she wasn't able to keep.", "Info: are your wife and her parents actually close? Do they live nearby? How often do they speak? There's info missing here \n\nIs your wife expected to recover? Are they the type to avoid hospitals? Do they have a \"Death takes everyone\" view? So much to ask about here and no one is.", "NTA \n\nHowever please know it isn\u2019t required someone be by her side every minute. You need to take care of yourself too. I know it\u2019s scary but the nurses really are there to take care of her.", "Why the LOLs?", "If my wife were in ICU on life support, I would be there 24/7 even if it cost me my job.", "Soft YTA. She is in the hospital you don\u2019t HAVE to be there to care for her, that is what this staff is for. You should have gone to work.", "Not enough info for me. \n\nDaughter is 23...so parents are what, mid 40s-50s.Guarantee one or both also have jobs and it sounds like they share one car. \n\nAlso, we don't know enough about the relationship between the daughter and her parents.

But if I were suddenly intubated and in the ICU, they\u2019d be on the next flight over here and spend every waking minute by my side! And vice versa. I\u2019m glad your spouse has such a wonderful support in you, I wish I could say the same about her parents.", "Wth, man? Your daughter is in ICU and you are partying? And how can the siblings think about celebrating something at this moment? \n\nNTA", "NTA. Your wife's parents are strangely disengaged.\n\nWhat do sitters cost?

Smh they just don\u2019t care about her.", "How old are they?", "NTA When my brother was hospitalized and intubated his friend stayed with him because the staff was too busy. She kept him alive. And that was a friend. She\u2019s family now fr.", "NTA, and I can understand you being beyond frustrated. There's no way I could do that if my child was in the hospital, grown or not. And on life support?!  \nBut in her defense, she did have that party to go to./s. If I've ever heard of a reason to go NC with a parent, this was it.", " NTA. As someone who spent 3 weeks in a medically induced coma and woke up alone I would have loved to have had a family member there but because of work and other obligations, no one could be bothered. Yes people came here and there but eventually had to go back to their lives and couldn\u2019t wait for me to wake up. Part of me understands but most of me is really really hurt that no one could bother to at least wait for me to wake up before heading back to their life.", "NTA if my daughter was in the hospital intubated I would be camped outside the door.", "NTA!!  She is out of line. Our local hospital has a horrendous reputation and most families engage a \u201csitter\u201d in these situations.

When my husband was in the ICU we had people with him round the clock. Nurses are there but he wasn\u2019t their only patient and it\u2019s incredibly helpful and important to have patients family members there to advocate. Honestly unbelievable that she didn\u2019t skip a birthday party to be there.", "Make some phone calls and see if there's a service or private individual you can hire to do this if it happens again. Her mother is a real piece of work. You might never get to really give her a piece of your mind as your wife's feeling trump your own here, but they've proven themselves worse than unreliable.", "Nta- please don\u2019t tell your wife they didn\u2019t give a fuck unless absolutely necessary though.", "OMG, what an awful woman. If my daughter was in ICU I'd be there and never leave. I wouldn't  burden wife with this story for a long time as she has enough to focus on but really! \nYou may as well leave inlaws out of the loop from now on since they care so much. Maybe they just know the drill after all these years but I'm still horrified by this. Praying for  good recovery for you and wife", "NTA. I'm single and nowhere near close to getting married, but I know for a fact that if I ever get married and end up having to be rushed to the hospital for whatever reason, my parents would drop ***everything*** and rush to the hospital to be by my side and be a support for my husband.", "NTA- I was in the hospital for 2 weeks cuz my water broke early. It\u2019s a long story, details aren\u2019t needed. My husband stayed the whole 18 days and when they took me back for my stat c section my mom was 1 hour away. She got to the hospital before I was even out of the OR. She was going like 90mph trying to get to me. It was the one time my grams said she\u2019d pay for a speeding ticket \ud83d\ude02 \n\nLike others have said, tell her what happened while she was out of it, give your opinion and ask her what she wants to do. Best of luck to you both.", "Fortunately, they\u2019re not her legal guardians, her grandparents are, because they were such shitty parents. I am sorry that happened to you, it\u2019s unacceptable.", "Hey! I was unconscious for three days after a slip and fall in the tub and my mom never took me to the hospital. \"What are they gonna do? Watch you? I can do that.\" Day 2, she asks a friend over to watch me because she wanted to go to a party and \"After all, it's not like anything could happen, she's just sleeping (aka in a coma)\" and off she went to a party. Sigh - yeah. Some parents hunh? I feel for ya.", "It was the super bowl though right? /S", "Yeah, I work at a hospital. Having family there is incredibly helpful and keeps the patient safe. It reduces the amount of meds needed, risk of falls, patients need less restraints (these can only be ordered by a doctor and are reassessed frequently), and the patient is happier with someone they know there, which cannot be understated. \n\nI was working in a hospital when one of my family members was admitted and had some delirium. The nurses called me from my unit to come help them frequently. Thankfully my boss was understanding so I would go soothe my family member then return back to work.", "Same. I'm a professional classical musician, and my parents tried to skip my first professional performance - it was a 20min drive from their house, I got them free tickets, I sat associate principal 2nd (front row of the symphony)...but it was the same night as their weekly raid on WoW...my husband had to explain why they shouldn't miss my concert.\n\nWhen I was re-hospitalized with post partum complications, though, my mom was literally on the next flight out. OP is NTA...and his in-laws are the absolute worst.", "oh, and if she does recover then you should tell her exactly what happened because this is something I'd be willing to completely cut off contact for. her daughter is in the hospital possibly dying and she clearly couldn't give two effs.", "Thank you for the reassurance lol. I\u2019d be here all day typing if I were to explain.", "My husband and I have learned it always helps to have a family member with you when in the hospital. If that was my daughter, I would be there in a heartbeat if you asked me to.", "Thank you, they found a cyst in the back of her brain causing the seizures. We just have to wait for her to get better before we can proceed. At least they found the problem.", "Right???  I\u2019m a mom of two 30+ women.  I would drop everything!", "Thank you I thought I was crazy for thinking the same thing. Like, is that not common sense?", "Thank you \ud83d\udda4", "Thank you. I\u2019m willing to bet she completely forgot about the birthday party, then decided to go to that and not communicate at all. She likes getting high (I mean so do I) and forgetting about important events. They\u2019re not the best people, in my opinion.", "Thank you", "Add\u2026waves hand - there are people for that\u2026getting drinks swabbing mouth getting aspirations- yep there is a small army for that\u2026", "That\u2019s actually a very sweet story about your mom\u2019s love", "Yeah but I\u2019m not about to call a nurse in there every 5 minutes to get the mucus out of her mouth ya know?", "There is a huge difference between a visitor and a support person. I have seen where hospitals do want a family member present almost 24/7 and that was during the height of COVID. The non-patient rules here also differentiated between support people and visitors.", "I worked in a hospital for several years. While yes, it\u2019s a nurses job to do that stuff, they are so backed up doing everything else that it\u2019s bound to take significantly longer than if she had a diligent family member who could be shown how. \n\nNTA", "I see what you\u2019re saying yeah. She also started it by saying SHE will be there at 3 and then it changed to just him and different time. It was just annoying, and if it was my kid, I\u2019d want be there as soon as she woke up. It was very \u2018touch and go\u2019 that first night. I wasn\u2019t sure if she was gonna make it.", "Not for nothing, but patients who can not advocate for themselves need someone to be there when medical professionals come in. Doctors and nurses are human and do, in fact, make deadly mistakes. My dad was in and out of the hospital during covid. He had Alzheimers.  I didn't leave his side at all for those hospitalizations because he couldn't advocate for himself, and I needed to do it. I had to leave my disabled mom home with a caregiver during those times. The OP is definitely NTA.", "She\u2019s incubated. People being there won\u2019t wake her up, but it would be comforting to have a loved one there when she does.  Having dealt with a MIL in ICU, I can tell you for sure it was important to have somewhere there for her, particularly when she couldn\u2019t speak for herself.", "She wasn\u2019t diagnosed with epilepsy until about 3 years ago, and hasn\u2019t been hospitalized before, so this is all new to them. I think the MIL was referring to her parents who passed away in the hospital. My spouse had 3 different tubes down in her mouth, it was pretty jarring for everyone.", "And that job gave you the health insurance?", "Absolutely. I'd do the same for my husband. But I'd try to get someone there to sit with him while I went to work so it didn't cost me my job if possible, so that the hardships were not compounded for our family.", "I\u2019m a nurse who spent years working in the hospital. You want someone there if you can help it, especially if the patient has been on a vent because that raises the risk of delirium. Because yes, our job is to care for them, but in an effort from hospitals to make as much money as possible we all had slightly more patients than we could reasonably manage. It was very difficult to find time to care for psychological needs as well as physical needs, and that\u2019s especially true now that we\u2019re getting into the fall respiratory virus surge that is never staffed for despite the fact it happens every single year. \n\nThis isn\u2019t an unreasonable ask on the husband\u2019s part, and if they couldn\u2019t do it they should have told him no so he could plan accordingly.", "Sounds like she needs mucus draining every five minutes; that would be tying a nurse up pretty much full time. I doubt they have staffing for that.", "She was disoriented from the sedation, so having someone there that she knows would definitely help with that. No amount of nurses and doctors can do that.", "So, you would rather he get fired because his wife is in the hospital, unknown when she would wake up, rather than be responsible and ask someone else she trusts to be there just in case she woke up? Interesting.", "OP's wife has seizures and this is very obviously not the first time. What do you expect him to do - get fired from his job and make their situation even more challenging?

Call another floor and say hey, soandso is up there, right? When you can spare her, we need to borrow her so she can talk her grandfather into taking his medicine, he just tried to hit me with his tray so right now it\u2019s not happening. And then sure enough, here would come soandso after finishing up with vitals, and grandpa gets his meds and doesn\u2019t try to hit me anymore. The bed alarm still goes off all night, but we don\u2019t have to call security so it\u2019s a win.", "Yes, even when a patient has one-on-one care at the hospital, it doesn't mean the nurse will always be in the room.  But also getting one-on-one care seems rarer these days?  Either way, family does usually need to help with the minute to minute needs of some patients.", "I don't have the same situation going on as you do - and I wish all the best for your wife's recovery and for your lives to get back to a normal state for you - but I can empathize with the literal walls of text it would take if I typed out all the things wrong with my husband's family.\n\nMIL can \"not appreciate your tone\" all she wants, but she should remember her lack of care when she's not included in future life milestones for you two.", "Come join us r/justnomil or r/justnofamily.

Always.", "If she is putting getting high above her daughters care in hospital she has a serious substance abuse issue. You are absolutely NTA.", "Legitimately, when you are in ICU care, there are people for that. My son's situation was severe enough in NICU that there was a night nurse assigned strictly to him. Plus, I've never dealt with any ICU where visitors are allowed 24 hours a day.", "Yeah. She could have just been honest instead of giving you a run around game, especially during a time like that. \nI agree, my kid, I'd want to be there. I'm sure they have been so many times before, it's just a norm for them at this point. \nI'm sorry you two are going through this. I hope she gets better soon.", "You are definitely NTA!!! Just so you know. I'd be pist.", "Ok well, it definitely seems like there is some additional context missing here that would explain why they weren't *already* at the hospital instead of a birthday party.\n\nNot sure what that is so I'm sticking with ESH.", "No my wife has health insurance of her own.", "They don\u2019t. If she was still on the vent it would be best for them to make time, though. Since she isn\u2019t on it anymore, well. It\u2019s not best practice, but you\u2019d be pressed to find a nurse that hasn\u2019t turned a blind eye to it at some point.", "Isn't ICU usually 1:1 ratio of patients to nurses?", "Your parents suck.", "Probably just so exasperated that he feels like he's in a farce by that point.", "That\u2019s such a weird comment. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re hung up on that. For some people it\u2019s an anxiety thing", "Chronically early stoner checking in.", "A lot of them allow that?

Now, our hospitals are overwhelmed and the ERs and ICUs were being closed on the weekends last summer because they couldn\u2019t handle it. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s many places that have a fully staffed 1:1 ICU or critical care unit, unfortunately.", "That\u2019s hilarious. I wish it wasn\u2019t. California, which has the best rules regarding nursing ratios IMO, doesn\u2019t even guarantee 1:1 nursing in the ICU. Assume an ICU nurse will have 2 patients at the least, but sometimes more.

Would it really have been that difficult to stay in the room with me and hold my hand? I was still throwing up (a reaction to the anestesia) when they left.
