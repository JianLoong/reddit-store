They can ask, they may even beg a little, but they have no right to get angry because you did not want them to come over a day early. Your Primary Responsibility is to your wife and child.

OP had to pack, trying to get rid of stuff they've discovered too late isn't worth taking (as it was buried too deep before) and dealing with the million and one things that crop up dealing with such moves (including corresponding multiple organisations, notifying various utilities and ensuring all the legal requirements are met). If you're not there to help pack/bring refreshments as OP & other family were packing into the night but expect their *time* as hosts expected to entertain them at such a hectic period then such people are definitely TA.
