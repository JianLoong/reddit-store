You still offered them to see the baby and spend time with you. Somehow being in your house was more important to them.", "YTA\n\n\"Dad and sister never help out.\"\n\nthey have to do 10 h to come see you what do you want them to do for you ?\n\n\"Each time I tried to POLITELY tell them (4+ times) why (per the above) it wasn\u2019t the best time to come over, they just got stronger/angrier.\"\n\nit's normal your excuse doesn't make sense at all", "YTA - you and them planned for them to come visit. It\u2019s your dad and sister, not a distant cousin. Different expectations. They don\u2019t want to just see the baby and hold for a few mins, they want to spend quality time with the baby. You should have just let them come over and navigate the moving mess. They know you\u2019re moving, it would have been perfectly fine for them to come to your house and navigate the mess. It sounds like you told them to travel to see you, then only agreed to see them for 1-2 hours in a restaurant. You seriously misled them at some point.", "Info-was this a planned trip or did they just show up.\n\nIf this was planned YTA. They came and arranged time to be there and spend time with you and their newest family member, it's not like they dropped by.\nIf it wasn't planned and they didnt make sure it was an acceptable time NTA. \n\nThere's not enough info here.", "YTA", "NTA. Your father and sister were AHs. Why did they even come at this time? Surely they must realize how inconvenient that was for everybody.", "NTA. It's astonishing how common this sort of thing is: couple has a baby, and suddenly family feel entitled to descend without warning and demand the couple drop everything to accommodate them, house them, feed them, etc. It doesn't matter how far they drove. You'd made clear, generous plans to be with them and they have no right to try to manipulate you into giving them extra time.", "So they\u2019re butthurt because you didn\u2019t drop everything to accommodate them? FFS\n\nYou were busy. Period. They could have waited. NTA", "NTA\n\nIt would have been nice for you to make sure they knew earlier that they would meet the baby somewhere else but its not enough to make you the ah. They still chose to not meet the baby at all instead of meeting the baby somewhere that wasnt your house. It seems to me like it wasnt that important to them and they are throwing a tantrum over their own choices.", "NTA. They showed no consideration for you. They didn't listen to you then they made the problem worse by becoming rude and confrontational.", "NTA\n\nSometimes you just have to set a boundary and stick to it.  You had too much going on to entertain guests.  This is a 'them' problem, not yours.\n\nGood luck on the move and congrats on the baby!", "NTA.\n\nUninvited entitled guests are generally the worst. It's your house and YOUR immediate family to take care of.", "NTA,  it is fully your decision and based on what you wrote you already went above and beyond to try to accomodate them best you could.  I'm sorry to read it went this far,  so if you were clear in explaining and they were not taking your wishes in their egoistical consideration then surely NTA.  and they are the A as meeting in the restaurant was not an option. Hopefully time will mend bad blood and you will be able (if you want of course) soon visit your family and perhaps go to the restaurant then?  :D", "NTA. When I drive 20 hours to see my niece, I KNOW that I have NO rights or expectations upon her time beyond what we agreed to when I made the trip. My status as a family member, and the distance I travel DOES NOT confer any 'extra-strength' right to her time.    They can ask, they may even beg a little, but they have no right to get angry because you did not want them to come over a day early. Your Primary Responsibility is to your wife and child. Your family unit was already under a lot of stress and despite what ANYONE says, having two more people there, even in a 'corner' is going to take away from the workflow and the time - and ADD to the stress.  How it played out was unfortunate, and maybe if they had backed down and apologized, things could have gone differently; but you are not TA for holding them to the pre-arranged plan that they agreed to in the first place, or sending them away when they wouldn't take No for an answer.", "NTA if they wanted to come over they could have offered to chat and help. If they were just in a corner they'd be a hindrance more than anything I'm sure", "NTA As you go through life you will realise that you cannot please everybody all of the time. Even if you make accommodation after accommodation for them and really put yourself out, they still wont be happy and it causes stress and drama for everyone. So it is better to stick to logic and do what works best for you.", "YTA unless they showed up a day early or they didn't tell you they were coming. It's a 10 hour drive.", "Nta. But it woulda been funny if u just said ok, fine! Come over. wear ur sneakers bc u will be helping or u won't be staying.", "Nta, sometimes plans change. It was unfortunate but their reaction was way out of control! Maybe tired and put out from the trip sure, you can give them that. Is it really that big of a deal? You did the right thing.", "NTA. I've only ever met my nephew in restaurants. Sometimes needs must and situations aren't perfect. Your family sound insufferable. Good on you for keeping a boundary.", "Esh with some major assumptions happening. \nFirst if you knew they wanted to visit and you okayed it then you are the ah. You should have suggest they come earlier or that they be prepared for a disaster zone and have the understanding that you would not be entertaining them, merely allowing them to see the child amongst the boxes. \nThey are the ah for not accepting what you said about meeting in the restaurant, if they really wanted to see the baby, they would have accepted any means of doing so. \nI fully understand that it\u2019s not a great time to have visitors but a ten hour drive would require some planning or 10 hours to text them and say it\u2019s not a good time please don\u2019t come. If they honestly sprung it on your completely then it\u2019s not your fault but if you had any knowledge then you have some responsibility for the disaster that occurred", "I'm here for this info as well. Did OP know that they were making a 10 hour drive and said yeah come meet the baby, and then sprung it on them afterwards that they were only getting to see the kid for 90 minutes at a restaurant? Personally if I made that kind of commitment I would expect to be able to spend actual quality time with who I came to see. \n\nAlso OP a nearby cousin being okay with seeing the kid at a restaurant is different than driving 10 hours and getting a hotel room and only getting to see the kid at a restaurant.", "*They had* ***a plan in place*** *for spending the whole next day together*, Father and Sis were pushing to come over a day early and wouldn't take No for an answer.", "My parents have made the 20 hour trip from their house to mine, without letting me know beforehand. I had gone no contact and my mom thought she could guilt and manipulate me into caving since they drove all that way. Didn\u2019t even answer the door, let them know through the doorbell camera we weren\u2019t available when they rang and then ignored the following rings, calls, and texts. (Traumatic childhood, I told her I needed boundaries when I was in my 30s, she refused them because \u201cwe\u2019re your parents and you don\u2019t get to treat us that way\u201d, so I cut them off.)", "Have you ever moved a long distance? Internationally, no less? Moving isn\u2019t easy. Its messy & tiring & stressful. How is OP the AH for telling his parents he needs to accommodate outside the home? They drove, but in the end chose to not meet the baby. Why did it matter that it HAD to be at the house? The house wasn\u2019t the environment that OP wanted everyone to meet. A restaurant is a good accommodation. Boundaries matter. NTA", "But they were still going to see the baby just not at their house?", "maybe they didn't want to meet this new born in a public place with a lot of noise", "Ah I must've misunderstood that part. I thought he meant be had *changed* the plans to be out for the day I stead of being at the house.", "He's the AH because he knew the circumstances and didn't say anything to them. Meeting your grandkid for the first time in a restaurant is just weird.\n\nHowever I've just realized OP said baby was born in July and they didn't come to meet him til November so I'm wondering why it took them so long to make the effort so I'm gonna change to ESH.", "You can't really spend some quality time with the baby at a hotel and how long would someone even spend the night at a hotel. OP, his wife and his MIL could have continued packing till his dad and sister would take care and spend some time with the baby. Plus they are his own family too. If they were some distant relatives then it would have been pretty inappropriate to let them come to a messy house.", "That\u2019s fair. They seemed to know they were moving in December, & as mentioned the baby was born in July. I personally wouldn\u2019t have wanted to pick the month prior to moving to visit. Its hectic so idk what anyone was expecting. Seems poorly planned all around & now feelings are hurt.", "why can\u2019t you spend quality time in a hotel? It\u2019s a baby. They don\u2019t know the difference between the living room at their house or a hotel room."]}
