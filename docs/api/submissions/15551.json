When I told Jack about the new rule, he got upset and later took to social media, accusing me of being homophobic and treating him unfairly.\n\nI understand that Jack's relationship is different from Ruby's in that they are same-sex partners, but I agree that the rules should be fair and apply to everyone. If the rule is that doors must be open when someone's partner is over, then it should apply to both Jack and Ruby, regardless of their gender or sexual preferences.\n\nThat being said, I do feel bad that Jack feels like I am treating him unfairly and being homophobic.

Even tho im legally an adult, it\u2019s still my parents house, so it\u2019s their rules and I respect that. \n\nI also think your son should consider himself to be lucky to even be allowed in his room with his s/o. For the longest time (including while I was 16-17) I wasn\u2019t even allowed to be in my room with my s/o. Even if the door was open. Even if one of my parents was upstairs too.

Instead of your son being allowed to have the door closed, let them both have them closed. contingent on the quality of open communication here of course, if they are able to come to you guys with their problems or discuss anything they might need guidance on. enforcing this new rule I'm afraid may deteriorate the communication with both kids exponentially. \n\nwhatever you decide, get your daughter on birth control. The kids are gonna find a way to have sex, an open door won't stop them. cars, outside, at school, in bathrooms, movies, etc.  if anything, enforcing a rule like this will just get them to lie. \n\nyour son is weaponizing his sexuality to get what he wants. It has nothing to do with homophobia. Everything to do with your daughter (I'm assuming you guys are making sure she doesn't get pregnant) and trying to amend rules to fit the whole.\n\nat any rate discuss the homophobia situation with your son, and the double standard situation with your daughter. and birth control and safe sex practices. \n\nsource: formerly sneaky teenage girl held to double standards. brothers had closed doors, I wasn't allowed to have a boyfriend (Asian conservative household). got pregnant alone at 15, drove to a different state to get an abortion, dealt with mourning a loss, grief, abusive relationship, PTSD all alone\n\nEdit: just reread your situation, and realized you were your son's age when you got pregnant with him. I suggest doing with your daughter what you think you needed from your adult role models at that time. that should give you pretty good direction where to go.", "Whats the pupose of the open door rule in the first place?
