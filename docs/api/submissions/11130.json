But, my advice would be to recommend focusing a bit less on your own upset with her and focus instead on getting your son into therapy so he can talk about his feelings about his mom with someone constructively. It seems like any discussion with you about her will be impacted by your own feelings, and he really, really deserves a healthy space to air out his feelings and get feedback neutrally.\n\nMoreover, if your son and you mutually decide to cut her out of your lives, then let that be that. Block her on socials, change your numbers if you have to. No more access to her Instagram, no more checking in on what lies she might be spreading.

As you said, this is an issue shes created for herself. Your son is 16 and can decide contact for himself. Any parent is kidding themselves if they think that their kid will stay in touch purely because of biological bond: you have to put in consistent work because kids don't owe you anything. \n\nBut as a former social worker and now therapist I would agree with other commenters not to bad mouth your ex. Your ex has showed how bad a strategy that is: she bad mouthed you on social media and now your son won't talk to her. I've also worked with too many kids where even if one parent was legitimately abusive, the other parent badmouthing them can really affect a kid. One kid I worked with put it best \"because they're bad, half of me is bad\".

I can't imagine why you would question it.\n\nIt's on her to fix.

I was fine paying child support if it meant I could have him 80/20. But when he turned 15 and could decide where he wanted to stay, I took my ex back to court and was ordered to stop paying child support.

Not sure when they got married, but that no longer makes you a single dad. You have help from your wife and her kids are also help entertain your kid and vice-versa.\n\nLastly if OP's 16 year old son is old enough to cut off contact, they also should have told their mom they didn't want her at the games themselves. \n\nESH imo.", "I don't think it's slut shaming but more like not providing stability to her son.

Just love and support Jeremy and let him decide how he wants to proceed. Make sure he knows that he can still love his mother and not like her at the same time. She is still his mother and he will probably have many conflicting love/hate feelings as well as feeling guilty about those feelings. He also might feel like he is a traitor/ taking sides  for having any loving feelings towards his mother when he knows how you feel about her. It can be hard.

Any parenting resource will tell you that.\n\nOP is judging her for that and I would too, regardless of which parent is doing it.", "But the slut part isn't the issue, he's not shaming her just for sleeping around, he's shaming her for bringing those multiple men into their home while the kid is around.", "OP Isn't denying his intent, but you are denying yours. There is no slut shaming this is just about twisting things to make OP the bad guy. OP didn't talk about her sex life explicitly, he talked about the effect she was having on his child. A single person without children can do whatever they want, but a parent has to make sure they are being responsible. Having a parade of people come in-and-out of a child's life can be damaging. Op's ex can do whatever she wants when their child is staying with him, but she needs to be more responsible when she has custody", "I'm just a better parent and spouse. Are you saying it's good parenting for a child to see their parent with multiple partners?"]}
