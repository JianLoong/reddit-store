I (28m) basically told my MIL that she would never meet my son.", "selftext": "My (28m) and my wife (28f) had our first child and got him his first rounds of vaccinations. We decided early on in the pregnancy that we would not let anyone see our child unless they got the Tdap or until he was fully vaccinated. For my family it has not been an issue. Everyone was already vaccinated because there are tons of kids. My wife's family was a whole different issue. \n\nMy MIL is super religious and is an antivaxer (claims that vaccines are the work of the devil). Well her and I never got along, she is the kind of person who will be kind to your face and then bad mouth you when you're not around. I am the kind of person that speaks my mind. That being said, the first time I met my MIL I called her out on badmouthing her daughter (my SIL) behind her back. Since then, my wife has asked me \"to keep the peace\". And as a result, I don't really talk to her family when I'm around them. So for 7 years I've listened to her badmouth her siblings, children, friends, and I've watched as everyone let's her off the hook because \"it's easier to just let her be\".\n\nWell now that my son is born MIL is asking to see him and my wife made it clear that she is welcome, as long as she gets the TDAP, otherwise she will have to wait until my son receives all the doctor recommended vaccinations. That's when my MIL went off, she started saying how my child is going to hell and if we vaccinate him there is nothing that will save his soul and so on and so on. At this point my wife was bawling her eyes out. I took the phone from my wife and said as calmly as I could \"I guess if my son is going to hell you have to wait to meet him when you get there too\" and I hung up the phone. \n\nI lost my temper, and I shouldn't have said anything, but I couldn't stand by while this woman makes my wife cry and tells us that our son is going to Hell. \n\nAt any rate MIL is furious and making a big stink about how we are \"taking away her grandson\". Right now the family is divided on what I said. My FIL is somewhat upset but understands, one SIL is on my side 100% and happy someone stood up to her mom. And the other sister is saying we should just let MIL have her way. My parents are also divided. My mom says that I'm an AH while my dad says that I'm doing what's right and protecting my family and that he was close to telling her off more than once in his few interactions with her.\n\nAfter years of MIL lies and manipulation and me biting my tongue to \"keep the peace\" I just lost it when she started in my view threatening my child's soul. My wife is upset I damaged her relationship with her mother but I think at this point something needed to be said. And at thai point, even if she does get vaccinated I don't think I want her near my child, there is too much evil in this world, why would I purposely put him near someone who already thinks he is condemned?\nSo I guess AITA?\n\nEdit: wow thank you guys for your words of encouragement. It definitely makes me feel better about my stance and holding my ground on this.", "created_utc": 1672933935, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1042b62/aita_i_28m_basically_told_my_mil_that_she_would/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have to protect your son, not just from the dangers she poses by not being vaccinated, but also from her abuse.\n\nAnd make no mistake, what she's doing is abuse. And everyone just \"letting her have her way\" is enabling it. (Depending on their situation, this *may* not be their fault - they have to do what they can to protect themselves). If you let her go unchecked, she will talk to/about your son the same way she talks to/about everyone else, and that could be very harmful to him as he develops. \n\nKeep her far away from him.", "NTA.\n\nSure, maybe you could have been nicer about it, but it sounds like your wife was already trying to handle things diplomatially and your MIL's response was to freak out and scream at her to the point that she was sobbing hysterically. And imo what you said was snarky at best. MIL brought up hell first. \n\nYou can't keep letting abusive people get their way just to keep the peace. It's what leads to further abusive situations because the abuser learns that their techniques work and will continue to behave in a way that gets them what they want. More importantly, this is your baby's *safety* that is at risk if she doesn't get her vaccinations. You shouldn't have to compromise on that. What does your SIL expect you to do? She wants you to let her mother get her way and see your baby without taking the proper precautions? She wants you to compromise the health of your child to appease MIL? That's ridiculous. \n\nI don't understand why your wife is so desperate to maintain a relationship with someone who behaves like this and hurts her. Has she spoken about this with a therapist?", "You absolute savage. I wish I was quick and witty like that. \n\nIn all seriousness, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019ve had to go through this for so many years holding back your opinion. As long as you and your wife agree on the vaccination front, I think it\u2019s perfectly fair to be protective of your son. \n\nOut of interest, how long until your son will be fully vaccinated? If we\u2019re talking a few months, that\u2019s perfectly fair and your MIL should have reacted better and accepted that. If we\u2019re talking like a year, then maybe I could understand her being upset as that is a long time to wait. But the way she responded to it all was way out of line regardless. \n\nI can understand why you wouldn\u2019t want your MIL to ever see your son, she will only continue to push her manipulations and lies onto your son which will only further damage your relationship with your son, wife and wife\u2019s side of the family. \n\nYou are NOT the asshole.", "NTA\n\nAnd be firm on this with your wife. Her mother will damage your child by telling him that he's going to hell because he's vaccinated. Tell your wife that she can have a relationship with her, but you and your son will not.

Standing ovation, dude.", "Nta, letting people know your religious views is one thing but being aggressive about it and condemning your child's soul is completely different. \nI'm glad you want to keep your child safe and someone needed to stand up to her, it's a shame her family wouldn't but some seem thankful that you did.", "NTA for keeping you child safe.  You took the stand you see him how if you are vaccinated and if you choose to not be vaccinated then you wait till the child has full vaccines. \n\nAs far as what you said about seeing him in hell.  While it was funny. It will not change anything unfortunately.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your kid. And your MIL sounds like a horribly toxic and abusive person", "NTA, and that was a brilliant reply!", "NTA. Your MIL is not only extreme in her views but trying to force her extremism on your family under the threat of your baby going to hell. This is horrendous and abusive behavior. Your wife needs to come out of the FOG (fear, obligation, guilt) that drives her to try to keep the peace with this toxic person. I\u2019d highly recommend you and your wife check out the community and resources on the JustNoMIL sub. Good luck, OP.", "NTA. Also, a negative peace is never worth it. Please stop placating your mother in law.

Your son's health - physical AND mental - is far more important than your MIL's feelings.", "NTA  \n\n\nYou were defending your family because someone had to. Ask your wife what is she first? A mother or a daughter? Someone needed to stand up to her, how long before her nonsense trickled down to your son. Normal adults can handle being told no. You know who can't? Toddlers and unhealthy humans.", "NTA. And good on you for not allowing MIL's shenanigans to continue into the next generation. The reason why the family rolled over so long ago and let her continue her behavior, is because it would make them *uncomfortable*. Well, guess what? Life's uncomfortable at times. Had someone put her in check long ago, she may have still held her opinions, but she'd probably kept them to herself. \n\nUntil MIL can show you that she can be a benign, positive presence in your family's life, she doesn't get a say.", "NTA\n\na grandchild is not a right, but a privilege. You have to earn many important things in life", "nta. I understand you daughter loves her mother....but she should love her child more. She needs to stop enabling her mother and stand up to her. That's the problem, everyone just lets it go rather than just facing the drama. If they did, it would actually be less work, cuz then they wouldn't have had to deal with her for so many years.", "NTA of the situation. Asshole-ish with your comeback, but in a good way. I'd have said worse probably. You're keeping your kid safe from preventable illnesses and idk about where you live but in my area there are SO MANY viruses and illnesses going around right now. I wouldn't risk it with my newborn. \n\nYou didn't damage your wife's relationship, her mother did by saying awful things about your child. However, having given birth to 3 children and experiencing that post partum \"fourth trimester\" as well as PPD/A your wife may be feeling extra emotional about the situation right now too.", "NTA\n\nIf you haven\u2019t seen videos of what whooping cough can do to a baby, I highly recommend seeing it and showing anyone that isn\u2019t on your side. Yes it\u2019s traumatic but sometimes people won\u2019t see it until they are forced to swallow a painful pill. On top of that, newborns can need hospitalizations for a ton of other things caused by people not being clean and careful.\n\nI doubt your MIL will ever change from the sounds of it, so you and your wife need to seriously discuss what the future will look like. I bet she will constantly try to push boundaries and you and your wife need to be ready to stand firm.

But yours, your wife\u2019s and your son\u2019s mental health is also super important. This isn\u2019t some one off situation where she went off the rails, she\u2019s been bad mouthing everyone for what has probably been their wholes lives so your MIL is probably used to being able to say whatever she wants with no repercussions. And at this point someone needs to put her in her place, and you have. It\u2019s unlikely that she\u2019ll have a \u201ccome to Jesus\u201d moment about how she\u2019s been treating everyone in her family but I really think she needs one.\n\nAlso, if she\u2019s so religious then she should know:\n\n**Matthew 7:1-2 Do not judge, or you too will be judged. \nFor in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you**", "NTA\n\nYour wife was bought up in what sounds like a controlling and narcissistic home where \"Mom gets her way or we all suffer for it\" and I would honestly suggest therapy in her undoing that conditioning so it doesn't bleed into her relationship with her son as he grows.\n\nThis is YOUR family now, and do you really want your child growing up knowing nobody will protect him against grandma because \"it's just the way she is\" \n\nProtect your son, and convince your wife to value herself more than she does.
