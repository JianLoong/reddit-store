I (28m) basically told my MIL that she would never meet my son.", "selftext": "My (28m) and my wife (28f) had our first child and got him his first rounds of vaccinations. We decided early on in the pregnancy that we would not let anyone see our child unless they got the Tdap or until he was fully vaccinated. For my family it has not been an issue. Everyone was already vaccinated because there are tons of kids. My wife's family was a whole different issue. \n\nMy MIL is super religious and is an antivaxer (claims that vaccines are the work of the devil). Well her and I never got along, she is the kind of person who will be kind to your face and then bad mouth you when you're not around. I am the kind of person that speaks my mind. That being said, the first time I met my MIL I called her out on badmouthing her daughter (my SIL) behind her back. Since then, my wife has asked me \"to keep the peace\". And as a result, I don't really talk to her family when I'm around them. So for 7 years I've listened to her badmouth her siblings, children, friends, and I've watched as everyone let's her off the hook because \"it's easier to just let her be\".\n\nWell now that my son is born MIL is asking to see him and my wife made it clear that she is welcome, as long as she gets the TDAP, otherwise she will have to wait until my son receives all the doctor recommended vaccinations. That's when my MIL went off, she started saying how my child is going to hell and if we vaccinate him there is nothing that will save his soul and so on and so on. At this point my wife was bawling her eyes out. I took the phone from my wife and said as calmly as I could \"I guess if my son is going to hell you have to wait to meet him when you get there too\" and I hung up the phone. \n\nI lost my temper, and I shouldn't have said anything, but I couldn't stand by while this woman makes my wife cry and tells us that our son is going to Hell. \n\nAt any rate MIL is furious and making a big stink about how we are \"taking away her grandson\". Right now the family is divided on what I said. My FIL is somewhat upset but understands, one SIL is on my side 100% and happy someone stood up to her mom. And the other sister is saying we should just let MIL have her way. My parents are also divided. My mom says that I'm an AH while my dad says that I'm doing what's right and protecting my family and that he was close to telling her off more than once in his few interactions with her.\n\nAfter years of MIL lies and manipulation and me biting my tongue to \"keep the peace\" I just lost it when she started in my view threatening my child's soul. My wife is upset I damaged her relationship with her mother but I think at this point something needed to be said. And at thai point, even if she does get vaccinated I don't think I want her near my child, there is too much evil in this world, why would I purposely put him near someone who already thinks he is condemned?\nSo I guess AITA?\n\nEdit: wow thank you guys for your words of encouragement.

And imo what you said was snarky at best. MIL brought up hell first. \n\nYou can't keep letting abusive people get their way just to keep the peace. It's what leads to further abusive situations because the abuser learns that their techniques work and will continue to behave in a way that gets them what they want. More importantly, this is your baby's *safety* that is at risk if she doesn't get her vaccinations. You shouldn't have to compromise on that. What does your SIL expect you to do? She wants you to let her mother get her way and see your baby without taking the proper precautions? She wants you to compromise the health of your child to appease MIL? That's ridiculous. \n\nI don't understand why your wife is so desperate to maintain a relationship with someone who behaves like this and hurts her.

If we\u2019re talking a few months, that\u2019s perfectly fair and your MIL should have reacted better and accepted that. If we\u2019re talking like a year, then maybe I could understand her being upset as that is a long time to wait. But the way she responded to it all was way out of line regardless. \n\nI can understand why you wouldn\u2019t want your MIL to ever see your son, she will only continue to push her manipulations and lies onto your son which will only further damage your relationship with your son, wife and wife\u2019s side of the family. \n\nYou are NOT the asshole.", "NTA\n\nAnd be firm on this with your wife.

On top of that, newborns can need hospitalizations for a ton of other things caused by people not being clean and careful.\n\nI doubt your MIL will ever change from the sounds of it, so you and your wife need to seriously discuss what the future will look like.

Letting MIL have her way means exposing your baby - your **infant son** to countless germs that he ***does not have the immune system to fight***. \n\nThat could be disastrous. \n\nThe religion angle just makes it worse IMO", "NTA. To be honest, you should ensure that anyone who meets your young child not only receive TdAP but also have been vaccinated for the flu and COVID prior to meeting your child. If the child is still an infant, you should also make them mask up when around the baby. RSV and other respiratory infections are no joke for babies and pediatric wards have been inundated with admissions of even school aged children who wouldn't normally be sick enough from RSV or the flu to be hospitalized who are requiring treatment in hospital because of co-infections of RSV/Flu/COVID. You have every right to lose your shit on anyone telling you that you should do anything that even potentially endangers your child", "NTA. So is your wife not vaccinated?", "Why should OP be nicer? MIL is using her \"religion\" to be a bully, bludgeon everyone around her, and generally being just a raging asshole. OP failed, in my opinion, in letting this go on as long as it has. \n\nHis wife needs to break free from the religious oppression of her mother, MIL needs to get smacked into her own lane and shut the fuck up. \n\nThe rest of your post I fully agree with, but in no universe is OP wrong to lose his shit on this evil woman", "Vaccination part obviously she is wrong I come from a country where only the illiterate will not vaccinate kids so I don't understand this mentality at all and I can't comment why some people are that dense. \n\nSecond part is enough  to say that if she never meets your son it is still too soon. If she can say that about an infant that she has never even met yet who is her own grandson then cannot imagine what she is saying about other people. This much evil is not something your son should be exposed to. \nNTA", "So much wrong in the world under the guise of religion", "Maybe if you were Fionn MacCumhaill & it was the finger/thumb you burnt on the salmon of knowledge. Otherwise, wtf?!? XD", "Dunno if this story is bait but you got the in-laws from hell. Don't mean to stress you out as you have a newborn and your wife is recovering but if your in-laws can threaten your son's wellbeing and your marriage I think at some point in the near future you gotta sit down with your wife and figure out what the hell you're gonna do. I think you should've gone NC with most of your in-laws years ago but it's your wife that is getting in the way of that and I'm sorry but you gotta cross that bridge at some point for the sake of your son and wife.", "> said as calmly as I could \"I guess if my son is going to hell you have to wait to meet him when you get there too\" and I hung up the phone.\n\nSir, I salute you! You are a BOSS! Don't change. You are 100000% correct. \n\nNTA, easiest call ever.\n\nYour MIL has probably been this way since \"the accident\" when someone dropped a house on her sister.", "I think something to keep in mind is that every button that your MIL uses with your wife, she installed. She knows how to manipulate her and get away with it, because she raised her that way. She was programmed to respond the way your MIL wants her to. If your wife is not in therapy, she should consider it.", "Repeating this comment. I thought that my saying \"maybe\" and then adding that I didn't think what he said was anything more than snarky made it clear that I don't actually fault him for how he replied. I was pointing out that his wife was already trying the \"nice\" approach and it wasn't working so it's kind of silly for his family to tell him that he could have handled it in a nicer way. I think you're misinterpreting me.", "Oh, child - your son won't be adequately protected by the basics. I'm over 40, and I'm still due for vaccinations - I wouldn't want to be exposed to your mother-in-law, for my own protection. \n\nLess flippantly, you're not just protecting your son, you're helping protect everyone. A good parent protects their child from danger, including abuse. You're doing that, *and* you're modeling boundaries around your mother-in-law, which may inspire others to do the same.", "I would not let MIL near child unless she is Covid vaxxed as well.", "It's a shame your sil had to move just to get some peace.\nIt seems that they would rather put up with her instead of dealing with the fall out, perhaps they feel that she would become for difficult if people called her out.", "NTA this woman is a monster. How could she tell her daughter that her new born child was going to hell? You said the least of what you could have.", "NTA and I think you gave her a burn that was hotter than the Devil's cheeks. It was well deserved and I feel sad that her entire family allows that kind of behavior and keeps quiet. Best to go LC or NC with her until things change (if they ever do).", "NTA\n\nThis is your baby's health you're talking about. \n\nYour mother-in-law is a bible thumping bully who will never change. Your wife is going to have to come to terms with that.", "You and your wife are responsible for protecting your child!", "That was a brilliant and savage comeback. I used to hang around with nutty people and now I'm like, is it really worth hanging around with selfish people who proudly spread disease and insane conspiracies? There's a measles outbreak in Ohio, and a lot of the kids are too young to protect themselves because you don't get the measles vaccine until you're 1 -- it's 2023, no excuse. You're NTA but I'm concerned your child's mother won't protect him", "NTA. Letting MIL \"just have her way\" puts your child's LIFE in danger. Anyone who says that as an argument is an AH too. So tired of this antivax crap.", "NTA. You are protecting your child against an overbearing delusional asshole of a MIL. Don't cave on this.", "NTA. I am giving you a standing ovation for protecting your son and wife. Tell everyone with negative opinions to sod off. This is your son. You will protect him from his toxic grandmother. Your wife needs some therapy.  If you have not read Toxic Parents and Toxic In- laws by Susan Forward get it. Any book by her is solid.", "Masterclass, she deserved it so much.

What a train wreck. Also kids die from whooping cough and are now getting polio as there is a resurgence from anti-vaxxing so definitely want to cautious with the little man and protect him.

She\u2019s abusive and needs to be called out for it.", "NTA. Don't let her even after the kid's got all his shots. There is no positive influence this person could possibly have on his life. Her entire existence is one of manipulating and abusing those around her. She is an entirely negative influence on the world and you are totally in the right to tell her so to her face at every opportunity. Boat rockers are emotional terrorists, don't participate.", "NTA at all. You MIL is a nut job as are all anti-vaxxers. Protect your child from her al all costs. She is poison.", "NTA: damaging her relationship with her mother? YOU?? not the mom disregarding her adult daughters beliefs and saying your BABY is going to hell??!", "NTA shouldn't let her see it, it's never an extreme anti-vaccine and religious thing, two completely disgusting things that are usually accompanied by a right-wing attitude, mental and physical illnesses, and a lot of inconvenience and hypocrisy, protect your family", "NTA. Shit behavior like this only stops when people refuse to accept it and start calling it out. Good on you for doing just that. I understand for your wifes sske you're trying to keep the peace, but  hopefully she is more understanding that you MIL needs to be called out.\n\nAlso, despite the fact that you've seemingly condemned you child to Hell ;), that was an epic comment to your MIL.", "NTA. You had the strength to stand up to to this vile woman because she was attacking those you love. Good for you.", ">and I've watched as everyone let's her off the hook because \"it's easier to just let her be\"\n\nAh yes, [Don't rock the boat](https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimFamilySolutions/comments/di7npz/this_analogy_is_incredible_do_read_it/)!\n\n>I've been thinking about this phrase a lot lately, about how unfair it is. Because we aren't the ones rocking the boat. It's the crazy lady jumping up and down and running side to side. Not the one sitting in the corner quietly not giving a fuck.  \nAt some point in her youth, Mum/MIL gave the boat a little nudge. And look how everyone jumped to steady the boat! So she does it again, and again. Soon her family is in the habit of swaying to counteract the crazy. She moves left, they move right, balance is restored (temporarily). Life goes on. People move on to boats of their own.  \nThe boat-rocker can't survive in a boat by herself. She's never had to face the consequences of her rocking. She'll tip over. So she finds an enabler: someone so proud of his boat-steadying skills that he secretly (or not so secretly) lives for the rocking.  \nThe boat-rocker escalates. The boat-steadier can't manage alone, but can't let the boat tip. After all, he's the best boat-steadier ever, and that can't be true if his boat capsizes, so therefore his boat can't capsize. How can they fix the situation?  \nBallast!  \nAnd the next generation of boat-steadiers is born.  \nA born boat-steadier doesn't know what solid ground feels like. He's so used to the constant swaying that anything else feels wrong and he'll fall over. There's a good chance the boat-rocker never taught him to swim either. He'll jump at the slightest twitch like his life depends on it, because it did .  \nWhen you're in their boat, you're expected to help steady it. When you decline, the other boat-steadiers get resentful. Look at you, just sitting there while they do all the work! They don't see that you aren't the one making the boat rock. They might not even see the life rafts available for them to get out. All they know is that the boat can't be allowed to tip, and you're not helping.  \nNow you and your DH get a boat of your own. With him not there, the balance of the boat changes. The remaining boat-steadiers have to work even harder.  \nWhile a rocking boat is most concerning to those inside, it does cause ripples. The nearby boats start to worry. They're getting splashed! Somebody do something!  \nSo the flying monkeys are dispatched. Can't you and DH see how much better it is for everyone (else) if you just get back on the boat and keep it steady? It would make their lives so much easier.  \nYou know what would be easier? If they all just chucked the bitch overboard.  \nThank you for letting me ramble. Thanks for the support, and advice, and humour. Thanks for just being here :)\n\nSend this to every member of her family who doesn't want to rock the boat - they deserve to know they are all her flying monkeys.\n\nNTA", "NOT the a--hole.
