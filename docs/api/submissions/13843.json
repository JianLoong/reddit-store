It was late, around 11ish, so it was just me and this other woman. \n\nShe was doing bench press at the bench next to mine with just the bar and was struggling. I took note of this but didn\u2019t think much of it other than thinking that she was probably a beginner and it\u2019s cool she made the plunge to start working out.\n\nAfter my set, I was resting, and noticed that she was loading up the bar with a 45 pound plate on each side. This immediately seemed like a bad idea: just previously, she was struggling with the bar, so adding 90 pounds to it wouldn\u2019t end well. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to get involved, and if I was in a normal commercial gym I\u2019d just let the staff handle it, but in this case this is a college gym without staff and nobody was there. I didn\u2019t want to immediately say \u2018you shouldn\u2019t do that\u2019 so I politely asked her if she wanted a spot. She declined, and so I felt I had no chance but telling her she probably shouldn\u2019t be going right from the bar to a 45 pound plate on each side. The reason I felt the need to tell her is, she had a serious chance of injuring herself. My reason for telling her is: it\u2019s possible she won\u2019t even be able to get the barbell off the rack, but it\u2019s also possible she\u2019ll just be able to do that but not able to lift it fully and hurt herself.\n\nShe got upset at this, and said she didn\u2019t feel comfortable with a stranger who\u2019s a man talking to her or telling her what to do at the gym. She did decide against the 45 pound plates though, so I shrugged and returned to my set.\n\nThinking about it now, I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong. I was just trying to prevent the possibility of injury, and I didn\u2019t really have any other option in this case but talking to her.

The people saying yta mean well, women get disproportionately bothered in gyms but there\u2019s a big difference between hitting on someone and trying to prevent someone from potentially making a life-altering mistake. The gender does not matter, you did the right thing, if they\u2019re struggling with the bar, they are going to die with 45s period.", "NTA. I'm a woman and I do not like to get unsolicited advice from anyone, and I also do not feel comfortable when strange men talk to me at the gym. I get where she's coming from. HOWEVER, you were trying to prevent this woman from what could be a severe injury. She should not be lifting without a spotter to begin with, but benching weight she can't handle could have led to a hospital visit. You did the right thing. I do question this gym for not having staff that would intervene. Sounds like a recipe for a lawsuit. You should tell someone at the gym what you saw because, at minimum, there should be signs posted about people benching without spotters.", "NAH really the approach you took was the least confrontational. I personally don\u2019t have a problem with men approaching me at the gym, but I understand why she\u2019d be cautious if it was just the two of you there alone late at night.", "Sucks that she was uncomfortable, and it's understandable why, but you are right that preventing someone from injuring themselves is priority. All these people saying you're TA are for some reason more concerned with the inherent immorality of a man approaching a woman than the possibility of, idk, a new/out of practice gym goer tearing a muscle and dropping weights on herself. Even if I could bench 200+ I wouldn't go up to it in 90lb intervals. NAH\n\nBy this logic, vaccines are bad because they cause momentary discomfort and \"she might not like me seeing her chest\" is an acceptable reason to not cut a woman's shirt off for an emergency defibrillator.  Like leave women alone yeah but some commenters' logic is starting to look like reductio ad absurdum. You're not supposed to avoid offering legitimate help to women lol\n\nEdit: changed to NAH", "NTA. I want to write a lot more (I\u2019m a weightlifter myself), but I\u2019m not looking forward to the crap I would get for putting my whole opinion out there.", "NAH. It does sound like she could do with help if she's trying to go from struggling with 20 kg to 60 kg - realistically though, if the bar was heavy for her she wasn't going to get 60 kg off the rack.\n\nBasically, I think you approached it pretty well: \"want a spot\" is pretty much the only way I'm down with offering or being offered help. The tone of the followup comment really determines who was a little in the wrong here.\n\nAnd IMO it's not an arsehole position to just want to be left alone and deal with the consequences of your own fuckups rather than being approached by strangers.", "NTA. \n\nYou were looking out for her safety.", "NAH. But if a similar situation happens in the future please don't get in a strange woman's space, even with good intentions. Especially if you're the only two people in the gym. If possible mention to another woman your concerns and leave it. It's a dangerous world for women, and I know you had good intentions. She doesn't though, and there have been documented assaults on women in small/ private gym situations in recent news. Not all men, but enough that all men are sus until proven otherwise.", "NTA - You'd have done the same if some scrawny guy were about to crush his own throat with a barbell, I'm sure.", "INFO: Are you a guy? It doesn\u2019t automatically make you an AH if you are, but, for most women, it does change the dynamic when they\u2019re alone with a guy they don\u2019t know and the guy is trying to tell them what to do (even with good intentions).", "NAH - completely understandable she just wanted to be left alone, and hadn't considered the safety issue. It's clear she was a beginner, and that weight could be enough to kill someone if they can't get it off their neck. I disagree with the comments saying you should say nothing - there is a chance the conversation could have saved her life. Your motive was safety, not flirting.\n\nYou could have communicated better though. Women often feel threatened at gyms, and it's rude to interrupt, so you could have started with an apology and then more blunt safety concern. Maybe like \"I'm very sorry to interrupt you and I'm not trying to be rude, but I'm worried you might get trapped under that weight and choke, as I saw you struggle with the bar.\" You offering to spot was likely interpreted as a way to start chatting.", "NAH man. You were polite and were looking out for another person's wellbeing.", "NAH. You\u2019re coming from a good place but most of the time advice from strangers is not appreciated. Save yourself the time and trouble and not say anything next time", "NTA. If it were another man or a kid struggling with the bar I\u2019m sure you would have said something. You did the right thing even if you made her uncomfortable. \n\nYou could have let her try to bench and then she\u2019d get pinned at which point you would come over and help get the weight off. \u201cI was going to say something about putting that much weight on the bar but I didn\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable.\u201d At which point she\u2019d probably call you an asshole.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou simply can not compensate for stupid. Think of it as evolution in action.", "I've had un-asked-for advice a few times in the gym, I think the difference between whether you're an AH or not comes down to why you're intervening. For me, I didn't mind the guy who stopped me in the midst of mis-using a machine, but I did mind the guy who assumed I was a newbie needing advice on more effective exercises (I was actually deliberately taking it easy because I'd been ill).\n\nThis sounds like it falls somewhere in the middle. Good intentions, probably poorly executed. NAH.", "This is actually the one instance where I would say you\u2019re NTA to step in at the gym. The bar itself weighs about 45 pounds. She was setting herself up for injury.", "NTA if she was struggling with a bar, I would be worried too. But did you see her actually try to lift it? Could she?", "Consider today's climate, yeah. Just mind your business man and just let Darwin do his thing. It's not worth it even if you're doing it for good.", " NTA. At all. \n\nPeople like her are so annoying. She is the AH", "NTA - she\u2019s the one that has issues, you were just trying to be helpful", "NTA\n\nShe would have hurt herself.  If she wanted to shoot the moon she should have brought a buddy or at the very least asked someone there to spot her.  I wouldn't worry about it.  Maybe she's a noob who got defensive, maybe she was making a clumsy play for your attention.", "If nobody asks you for advice, don't go up to strangers and give it anyway. This is one of the written rules at my gym. And it's there for good reason imo. \n\nLet adults make decisions by themselves, even when you might know better.\n\nI believe that you wanted to genuinely give advice and not be a gym creep but you should have left her alone.\nSo yeah, in this case YTA.", "YTA how many posts like we this do we need for people to keep to them fucking selves at the gym?", "NTA..\n\nShe was just being sensitive and freaked out. Someone that jumpy probably shouldn't be doing it late at night.", "NTA.   I have never seen staff offer to help someone  or suggest a safer way to use a machine or weights.....ever.\n\nIt didn't bother me if some guy offered to help.  I wasn't pretty enough to be hit on, lol", "NTA (forgot to add). Female here. Unsolicited advice delivered for safety or alternate exercises is welcome. A fellow regular at the gym saw me add a bunch of weight to a machine after warming up with it and asked me \u201cI\u2019ve got a quick question for you before you do that next set\u201d I said \u201cYou can work in if you\u2019d like\u201d he said \u201cNo, did you fall or pull your left side this week? Your range of motion is off\u201d I had both fallen off an obstacle at the endurance course and got tossed pretty good while sparring. I said yes and he suggested an alternate exercise so I wouldn\u2019t tear my muscle. He offered to record and then delete a video on his phone or mine showing how my form was off as well. I am happy that he helped me out. I think some women (and men) assume all advice is condescending and or a precursor to flirt/harassment. Some people are very direct (sometimes taken as rude) with advice and others are better at phrasing it to sound friendly", "YTA. She said no. No means no.", "NTA! Not at all! As a woman I get that men in gyms can be creepers but Jesus. First of all, this gym needs staff, like now. Secondly, you were saving that chick a world of pain. If she was struggling with the bar, why on earth did she think adding weight was a good idea? She was 100% going to hurt herself. You did good OP.", "NTA\n\nSeems like your only alternative to warning her was to stand by and watch her most likely get into trouble and hurt herself.  I think you did the right thing.  And you wisely backed off and went back to what you were doing when she let you know she didn't want to engage.", "NTA!  You kept her from potentially killing herself.\n\nIf she can't even balance the bar there's no way she should have even tried an extra 90 lbs\n\nAs a woman,  I would probably suggested that she use the nautilus equipment instead.", "[removed]", "I\u2019m noticing that overwhelmingly the responses are coming from DUDES. \n\n\nNo big deal either way, but it might be notable that this is kind of an echo chamber and you\u2019re not getting many women\u2019s opinions, so this may not be the place to ask .\n\nNot to mention, the other overwhelming thing here is that any time a woman responds you\u2019re arguing with them, and not wanting to hear their response for the most part, so\u2026 You already know what you want to hear", "NTA. Sure are a lot of people commenting who have obviously never been to a gym. I welcome any advice from someone more experienced from me, especially since I have torn a tendon in my shoulder before lifting wrong/too heavy. She obviously has issues, you didn't pressure her about anything. That's on her, not you. Keep being a good gym bro!", "YTA she said NO", "YTA. You offered a spot and she said no. It\u2019s clear from your offer you were concerned. You didn\u2019t need to then tell her how to do her workout. Your help was rejected. You\u2019re the asshole because you ignored this", "[removed]", "NTA\n\nAt all. I gasped when I read the 45 lb plates were being added. I\u2019m a female who lifts weights; with that I have experienced those injuries that sidetrack training for months (and an awful upper back injury that inexplicably resurrects itself at least once a year). I alway appreciate genuine guidance and education. She might be too young and too proud, but an injury will humble her.", "NTA. I was ready to judge at first but when you described what she was doing, that just seems stupid and unsafe.", "NTA.\n\nHeroes don\u2019t do hero\u2019s work for the recognition. \n\nRealistically that weight would\u2019ve dropped hard on her chest/neck/ribs.

Given that she struggled with an empty bar, you had every reason to assume that she isn't strong enough to bench 135lbs.

If she ended up attempting the weight and succeeding, you still wouldn't be the asshole because you used your best judgement to draw her attention to a valid safety concern.

No.\n\nFor example, about two days ago, I was getting out of the hospital and a random man started flirting with me and hugged me despite me saying no. There were four other men there and not one of them did a damn thing despite me being very clear about my no. Did I get raped? Not this time. Would those men have stepped in if it escalated to rape? Maybe. Are those 5 total men representative of all men? No. But you have to admit it\u2019s disturbing that not ONE man out of all five was decent enough to think that a random man touching me without consent was a problem. \n\nAnd that was just last week\u2026.\n\nEdit: also a lot of my safe people are men too.

What is asshole behavior is implying women being nervous about being randomly approached means they think men are bad for \u201cdaring\u201d to talk to them.", "When did I claim he\u2019s the asshole?\n\nI\u2019m saying the phrase \u201cmen are demonized for daring to speak to women\u201d is a very inaccurate extrapolation from a woman being nervous after being approached by what appeared to her as a random man.\n\nEdit: I find it telling that in response to my comment about a large enough percentage of men being bad people that women need to worry about harassment regularly, you wished for my death.\n\nVery cool.", "I would say that both of our opinions and views are valid and experience-based, so thank you for explaining your perspective.", "Wrong. Decent men do approach women when they are alone and about to do something stupid that could seriously injure them and no one else is there to step in.\n\nYoure view of \"decent men\" is grossly skewed. Seek help.....maybe from a decent man lol", "\"Sizeable percentage of men suck\"\n\nSays a person who probably is a sizeable percentage of suck themselves.", "Yes, you are right. Decent men do approach women when they are about to seriously injure themselves.\n\nNotice that I used the phrase \u201cgenerally don\u2019t\u201d not \u201cnever\u201d I\u2019m talking about most cases when a man randomly approaches a woman. \n\nI\u2019m harassed at least once a week. I can guarantee you that I am not seriously injuring myself once a week. This means that the vast majority of men who do approach me are NOT doing it in the same situation as OP.\n\nOP is NOT an asshole.", "Sizable meaning enough that I get harassed at least once a week. So probably like 5%. \n\nIf I only suck that much, I\u2019m doing something right. I honestly thought it was higher.", "I love how there are people here is saying to \"leave women alone, every single woman has trauma from a man, you are not allowed to even think about looking at a woman\" but if she had dropped that bar on herself and he didn't do anything you'd all be calling for him to be arrested.\n\nNTA.", "When someone is doing something dangerous, you have a human duty to help or be available for the cleanup.\n\nEven if it makes them uncomfortable.\n\nEven if it makes you the bad guy.\n\nBeing honourable doesn\u2019t always get you a medal, but you\u2019re being a decent human, so that\u2019s all the reward or thanks you\u2019ll get.\n\nNTA", "YTA. Her workout is none of your business.", "NTA. She would have been much more uncomfortable if her neck was stuck under the bar.", "NAH \n\nYou were well intentioned and the chances are you would be the person that would have had to help if she failed and wound up trapped under that bar. \n\nShe was wearing armour to protect herself in an environment that see women harassed way too often. It pays to be prickly when guys make up any excuse to approach you. \n\nThe real AHs here are the ones that make women feel so unsafe and on guard whenever they're approached.", "NAH, but the cleverer thing to do would be to offer to spot her, so she can make the mistake and learn from it without dying. Now I'm just worried she'll try it again but wait until she's alone so no one bothers her \ud83d\ude2c she sounds pretty eager to hurt herself, assuming your assessment of her strength is accurate", "The absolute insanity in this thread is absurd.\n\nThe people in here saying how OP didn't respect the girl saying \"no\" would rather the girl die than have her \"no men are allowed to talk to me\" rule encroached upon. Like this belief system is more important than her life?\n\nPeople, likely way stronger and more experienced than this chick, have died doing this same exercise.\n\nThe people shit talking OP are the ironic misogynists in this thread. Sorry, but the chick's life is worth more than her mantra.\n\nNTA", "NAH\n\n\nYou were polite, considerate,", "Really you want op to tell on her lol. The fuck do you even tell? Jesus some people need to get off the internet and go outside", "This. Something feels a little off lol", "The gender of any of the parties involved are irrelevant.\n\nOP only involved himself in what the chick was doing because she was being reckless with her own safety. Gravity and mass are not agents of the patriarchy. \n\nPeople die because they try to bench more than they are capable of lifting. Why do you want this woman to die? Your misogyny is showing.", "Honestly, I feel like if guys are concerned about a woman getting hurt, unless there's an immediate danger, grabbing a staff member to approach might be slightly better.", "I cn actually understand why. When I just started exercising, I would struggle with form on lower weights (like a 2 kg dumbbell in each hand), but I kept asking my boyfriend for heavier ones. He was so confused and trying to explain that I'm already struggling, while I couldn't describe that it feels too light to actually give me some sort of \"balance\" because my muscles were not built enough to properly focus them without more weight. He never let me press though, so I can't tell if it's the same, and of course I was recovering from a very long period of no physical activity (not even standing up at all), so his gym sessions were accompanied with physical therapy too.", "Gyms have managers, trainers and front desk workers. I did not mean for him to \"tell on her\" but to definitely tell someone that there should be signage stating that benching without a spotter is dangerous. Also, anyone who signs up for a gym membership should be told that they shouldn't bench free weights without a spotter. This is a very serious issue - as a former personal trainer I can tell you that people get severely injured by using equipment incorrectly. Everyone would be better off if the gym took notice of these types of things happening.", "Let her? Yep, YTA. It\u2019s not up to you to interfere and let or not let her perform whatever exercise she wants to. No staff or anyone else around makes this extra creepy.", "You did thou", "He obviously manipulated the situation in order for him to be able to lift the weight off her just to get his penis close to her.", "People can die from heavy barbell benching without a spotter. If the girl in this story keeps making dumb decisions like she was insistent upon making - until OP intervened in her stupidity - she may not receive much more \"unwanted advice.\"", "OP said that was not an option in this gym.", "Yeah, I\u2019m incredibly baffled by not being able to easily bench the bar, but then thinking one can load 90 lbs on it and bench?  The bars alone are usually 45lb.  So she was going to attempt a 135 bench press with no spot???\n\nI started at 75lb and that was with me have some strength/fitness behind me, plus we did max lift testing first to determine our percentages.\n\nWeight lifting is no joke - you can injure yourself so easily in a lot of different ways.", "None of that was going to happen, because she was too weak to get that far into the exercise. She probably was just trying to figure out how heavy it would feel, picking it up only enough to test it out.", "Do you understand, with that much weight, if she couldn't finish the eccentric portion of the exercise, she could literally die. Literally die. Do I need to repeat that for you again?\n\nHer fleeting anxiety is way less anxiety than she would have while her life slips away, if she couldn't get the bar off her chest. The notion that an emotional trigger response should have more gravity than a bona-fide safety concern is actual lunacy. You sound like a crazy person.", "Exactly. As a person who just chewed my brother out all up and down both sides today in order to keep one or other of his toddlers from getting killed (he was supervising them real casually/barely at all near a dangerous waterfall), I applaud you. My brother may come back and call me TA in the morning, who cares (I usually would! but nope), his kids are alive. Sometimes you just gotta.", "I personally think its smarter to use one of those universal machines where you bench the weight but it controls your form and cant crush you. They max out pretty low but theyre good for starting out, getting tone, and working on form. Im a noob in the gym, if someone suggests something I just say thanks, Im new so I appreciate the advice. Its okay not to hate the world.....even when, gasp, they have the dreaded.....penis. The west seems hell bent to normalize misandry and misogyny.....nope, some people are just assholes lol next.", "So......say something respectfully and polite to make sure she didnt accidentally hurt or off herself or assume she \"probably\" would suddenly be smarter than she had been prior.......yeah health and safety stuff isnt the world of probably IMO. Even if youre right 99 out of 100 times, that 1 idiot benefits while the other 99 should just laugh and say oh I know haha but thanks for making sure, its nice there are still decent people looking out for others.", "That would not happen. She was too week to hoist it into that position from your description.", "So you had a spot when you were doing bench presses next to her?", "If you have ever had to lift a barbell off of an overzealous person benching, who is always actually grateful to be able to breathe again - you would know how important it is to have spacial awareness in a place where you can find yourself in danger in a split second.", "I dont doubt youre harassed, as Im sure many women are more than zero times a week which is too much for the son, brother and father of daughters that I am. Thats not okay. But I expect my daughters to read the room, if a guy is polite, keeps a safe distance and respects her wishes, hes a decent man. I would expect my girls to be respectful but firm. They dont need to be rude to a respectful man. Now if a person is disrespectful different rules apply.   We shouldnt live and judge based on percentage this or that. Dont put yourself in a situation you cant be polite to polite people if youre that uncomfortable and need to get upset. Thats a \"her\" problem that has nothing to do with men at large. Its misandry to say otherwise IMO."]}
