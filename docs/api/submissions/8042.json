Before that we used to hang out, she'd stay over at my place some weekends, and we'd go do activities together.

My husband's 15yo daughter is fine with things and is happy to spend time with me and have a relationship, things with her didn't really change. (Both kids live primarily with their mom.)\n\nA while back I managed to get 4 tickets to a show that's hard to get tickets to. (I solely bought the tickets.) Originally my husband and I were going to invite another couple we're friends with as a surprise since they're great people. Unfortunately, scheduling did not work out for that. My husband then told his kids that we have the tickets and both are excited and really wanting to go. The problem is, the 17yo demands that I not be included and wants my husband to make me stay home so she can invite her best friend to the show. \n\n17yo says if I'm there she will not go and if she misses this she will never forget it or forgive her dad for not putting her first. 15yo wants her sister to let it go and make the best of it. I spent over $2.5k from my personal account on those tickets and have no interest in missing this show, I've made thar clear to my husband, but I'm willing to not speak to 17yo if that's what she wants so she'll chill and just go with us. 17yo is sticking firm with if I go she will not. My husband thinks me and 17yo are both being unreasonable, but me more because I'm an adult and he feels I'm putting a few thousand dollars above his relationship with his daughter and the show comes around every few years or so and I'll have other chances to go. (If it matters, the kids have been before, this would be my first time.) 17yo because she's completely unwilling to compromise and it's either her way or nothing and my husband feels like if he doesn't take her after telling her about the tickets and getting 17yo and 15yo excited it could ruin his relationship with 17yo. \n\nIt's at a stalemate right now and I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong or not. Husband is frustrated I'm putting him in a difficult position. AITA?\n\n***was advised to add this: We don't even have the kids the weekend of the show. And they're already going with their grandparents.

Your husband is ridiculous for allowing his other daughter to blackmail you.  NTA", "NTA. Normally I'd be on the kids side but that was literally your money and she's being unreasonable af. No idea how she expected that to actually work in her favour when they're not her dad's tickets they're yours.", "$2500??!!! NTA, in any way. If she doesn\u2019t come, let the other girl bring a friend instead so the money isn\u2019t totally wasted, but DO NOT let your husband fold and disrespect you like that. Let him deal with his daughter (I\u2019m sure she\u2019s just going through something and needs time and maybe counseling to process whatever it is), but on this issue you are totally in the right.", "NTA although it seems like the best solution would be to go without husband *and* 17yo. Take the 15yo, have *her* invite a friend and give the fourth ticket either to that friend\u2019s parent or a friend of yours. \n\nThat way husband doesn\u2019t has to choose either of you but she still doesn\u2019t get to force you out of tickets *you* bought for a show that *you* wanted to see. Your husband even considering to give in to this outrageous demand is worrying. How long has she been getting away with that level of manipulation? \n\nA 17yo needs to understand that those aren\u2019t her father\u2018s tickets to begin with so she can throw tantrums as much as she wants, the owner of those tickets certainly won\u2019t refrain from using them.", "I was ready to rip you apart from the title & first paragraph or so but utterly NTA.\n\nI suggest that your husband stay home with the 17 year old and explain that since you bought the tickets he couldn't very well tell you not to come and you take your younger stepdaughter & sell the other tickets to pay for a mani-pedi, &  a nice dinner . (Yeah,  I know that would not use up even half of one ticket,  but new clothes and a limo for the show might be going too far to make a point \ud83d\ude09)", "NTA. Tell husband and daughter that you found a perfect compromise- you will cancel or resell the tickets and put the $2500 YOU spent back into YOUR account.\n\nTell her that it's unfair to make daddy choose, so this is the best solution unless she can come up with something more reasonable, such as a compromise where you both go.", "Usually I am all for parents putting their kids first but... NTA.\n\nThat 17 year old is being bratty, plain and simple. You bought the tickets and planned this, if she cannot suck it up and go with you then she shouldn't go. In what world is it okay to disinvite the person who bought the tickets and invite a friend? Woweeeeeee the audacity. \n\nHer dad should consider some therapy for her as well.", "Wtf. Nta. She sounds like spoiled brat. They\u2019re YOUR tickets. If she wants to have one, she can. But they\u2019re not ALL hers. Your husband is the unreasonable one. If he wants to take her to the show without you, he should buy them both tickets. It\u2019s a pretty simple solution. I say, let the 15yo bring a friend.", "NTA. They\u2019re your tickets, for heaven\u2019s sake. 17-year-old is behaving like brat and your husband is enabling her. He needs to explain to her that you are going and she has been invited to come along under those conditions. If she doesn\u2019t want to go, fine, you\u2019ll take someone else. Or he can buy two more tickets and sit with her somewhere else.", "NTA. I bet the 15 year old has a friend who would like to see the show. Or sell 2 of the tickets, & you and the 15 year old go by yourselves.  There\u2019s no way in hell that I would pay $2.5K for tickets & give up seeing the show myself in favor of somebody acting like the 17 year old is acting.  If your husband thinks his relationship with the 17 year old is worth a few thousand dollars of his money (not your money) then let him buy her tickets for this show. Scalpers are a thing, even if this is Taylor Swift.", "NTA\n\nHere's the solution. Him and his kid don't go at all. You take those three extra tickets and invite your friends or family. Or take the 15 year old and two of her friends.\n\nI wouldn't take that kid anywhere. Ever. She's playing power games with your husband and he's falling for it. The tickets belong to YOU. Not him. Nor his entitled brat kid.", "NTA that's really expensive and sounds like a special treat and that's so entitled of her", "NTA\n\nYou bought the tickets. One of them should definitely be yours.\n\nHas your husband considered counseling for the eldest for her to work through her anger?", "NTA - from the title I came here ready to rip you a new one. As I see it, you bought the tickets and invited your husband and the two girls to go so you\u2019re not making them choose anything. \n\nThe 17yo is doing everything she can to destroy your relationship and your husband is being a coward. A bit manipulative as well. To be honest I\u2019d disinvite both of them. Have the 14yo invite a friend, you invite a friend and have fun bonding without the two drama queens. \n\nHonestly, this isn\u2019t going to get any better until your husband parents his child. His behavior and attitude is more unacceptable than the 17yo\u2026\u2026\u2026..at least she has young and dumb on her side, what\u2019s his excuse?", "NTA. By the title I was certain that I was going to say the opposite! Those are your tickets and you are being nice enough to include her. She is being manipulative and your husband is falling for it. He needs to have your back for this to show his children that you're in a stable relationship that can't be ruined by her tactics, otherwise these games are going to continue and that is completely on him.\n\nI cringe at how I relate to his daughter, when I was younger I'd treat my stepdad like garbage because I was brainwashed by my dad. Now I am closer to him than my dad, and I regret the way I treated him. I hope for your sake it is just a stage and your husband can ride it out by your side, good luck!", "Your husband is completely wrong. \n\nHe's teaching his daughter that if she acts out about you she'll get what she wants. It's blatant, vindictive blackmail and his response is to.... reward it??\n\nIf he can't talk to and parent his daughter properly enough to keep a good relationship with her without saying yes to this, that is a him problem. It is his responsibility to do better than this.\n\nHe is making a bad mistake to play this 'I can buy my relationship with my daughter by letting her have anything she demands' approach, especially when it's at your detriment.\n\nI imagine that he is scared about the state of his relationship with her and that is understandable. But this is not the way out, and to get frustrated with you for reaonsably declining her demand is unfair. \n\nHe needs to do the much more difficult thing of saying no to her while also having a good solid heart to heart about why and address her underlying feelings about him moving on. \n\nThat was also his responsibility before you got married, moreso than yours, despite you blaming yourself for not talking her through it. \n\nHe can't buy a solution to this - not with his money and certainly not with yours. \n\nNTA", "NTA. Tell your husband that he can stay home with his selfish brat of a daughter and you will find two other people to go with you and the 15-year-old. Your husband in a big AH for allowing his daughter to act like she is and not stopping it. WTF is wrong with him thinking you staying home over her BS is right?", "Nta\nIf I'm reading this right, daughter is essentially holding her breath to get her way. She is the one choosing to not go.  You bought the tickets for the 4 of your family. None of the rest of you are responsible for the consequences of her choices. \n\n\n\nUnfortunately there will likely be consequences for you all regardless", "NTA. The 17 year old is being completely unreasonable. The fact that your husband would even consider what his 17 year old is demanding shows that he doesn\u2019t respect you. He and 17 year old are the AH\u2019s.", "NTA. The cost of the tickets aside, you bought them so you could go with your husband and friends.  That fell through and the daughters got invited. The 17yo is trying to drive a wedge between you and your husband by making him choose. Probably being influenced by her mom - I\u2019ve been there and seen this kind of behaviour firsthand. Go see the show. If 17yo goes, cool. If not, that\u2019s her choice and she will get over it when she grows up a bit.", "NTA, so you take your 15 yr old step-daughter and two other people while your husband and other step-daughter do something or do nothing, IDK. Your husband is being an AH and so is his daughter.", "NTA, you are the one with the tickets and you are the one extending the invitation.  The 17 year old can either accept or decline.", "NTA, you paid for the tickets wanting to go. It's pretty rude for her to expect you to forfeit your ticket that you bought for yourself so she can bring a friend just because she doesn't like you. It really is a sticky situation and it seems like nobody can win here, I'm sorry. I hope it works out in the end. Please keep us updated", "NTA the 17y.o is ridiculous. The father should not have let this situation become like this as well. Should have nipped it in the bud. \n\"It's her tickets and it's her decision. Obviously she is going, if you want you can come or we can invite someone else\"\n\nHe should not have let her dictate her terms on YOUR tickets.", "NTA. If dad gives in, the 17 year old will think she's right and will continue to make unreasonable demands. You aren't going to disappear because she doesn't like you. And it's you paying for the tickets, so she's doubly the AH for thinking she's entitled to your money while cutting you out.\n\nShe's making you the scapegoat for her parent's divorce. I don't know how to make it better, but this show (shot in the dark,Taylor Swift?) isn't it. \n\nIf dad reimburses you for the tickets, it may be acceptable to uninvite you. But it won't fix the crux of the issue, your step daughter's animosity toward you.", "NTA\n\nIt sounds strange to me, the sudden change in her attitude towards you, but that is besides the point.\n\nHas hubby explained that the tickets are yours and not his?\n\nHe might as someone said side with 17yo daughter over you, but maybe he should teach her that the world does not revolve around her all the time", "Sell 2 tickets, keep 2 and take another friend.  He can go then feel free to go buy tix for him and his daughters. Problem solved   If he can't buy tickets then that is his problem.", "NTA.   That girl needs a dose of reality.  So does her father.   I am always amazed at how little some people seem to think thousands of dollars are when they haven't contributed a dime.  You bought the tickets - you get to go - end of story.  Take the younger daughter  who is appreciative  and sell the two other tickets.   That would be the adult thing to do I guess since your husband refuses to back you up.", "NTA\n\nYou are not the one making your husband choose, his 17yo daughter is.\n\nYou, the 15yo and your husband go and have an awesome time. The 17yo is trying to emotionally manipulate her dad, she is old enough to know exactly what she is doing and if you and your husband does not put a stop to it now, it wil never end.\n\nAlternatively, drop your husband and his 17yo, you and the 15yo go, each with another friend and have a girl's night.", "NTA - from the title alone, I would've definitely thought you're the AH here, but the title is misleading.\n\nIt's the 17 year old daughter who's making her dad choose, not you. She's the one who put the ultimatum on the table. \n\nYou've bought those tickets, because you wanted to go, his daughters weren't even invited originally.\n\nThe elder daughter is acting like an entitled teen and trying to manipulate her father to get her way at the expense of you.", "Imagine, these are your tickets. I\u2019d tell the brat to stay at home and allow the 15 year old a friend. Here\u2019s 15 bucks for a little Caesar\u2019s pizza. NTA. It\u2019s not his choice who goes . It\u2019s yours and you have all the power.", "Wow. This is so unfair to you.  Does she know you paid for the tickets and not her Dad? \n\nSounds like it doesn\u2019t matter if she goes or not, she\u2019s already put you on her enemy number one list. If she and her friend gets to go, she\u2019ll only continue doing this kind of blackmail. If she doesn\u2019t go, your husband will blame you. \n\nI\u2019d sell all the tickets and no one gets to go. But I\u2019m petty that way. \n\nNTA you\u2019re between a rock and a hard place.", "NTA - daughter and husband clearly are. Husband should have put his foot down at the first ask, but to expect you to give up the tickets that you paid for is crazy. Did he even offer to buy them off you since he has no spine and can\u2019t tell his daughter no?", "NTA. Hubby needs to correct his child and uninvite her if she won\u2019t behave. That kid needs to learn to hear \u2018no\u2019 more often.", "NTA you spent the money and invited them, they belong to you and it's only you that should decide who goes.\nI can sympathize with your husband to an extent, it's horrible having to leave you kids full time and end up only seeing them a few times a week \nAnd I can sympathize with the daughter struggling with her dad moving on\nHOWEVER it's your husband who needs to \"be the grown up\" and explain to his soon to be adult daughter that this is a her problem and she needs to get on board or stay home.", "Nta and in my opinion the 17 y o  invitation is revoked on the grounds of being a selfish, entitled brat who is attempting to emotionally manipulate her father. \n\nIt\u2019s simple for him \u201choney, they aren\u2019t my tickets as I never paid for them. I don\u2019t get to dictate who uses them or the terms.\u201d \n\nTake the 15 yo and tell your husband if he keeps pushing his invitation will also be revoked. \n\nYou guys need counseling because he is enabling this behavior. He is parenting from guilt and projection and raising an ah in the process", "NTA.\n\nDaddy's little girl is about to be a legal adult. These tantrums are completely out of line. Your husband has to stand his ground and make her respect your relationship.", "NTA \n\nYou brought the tickets for an even you want to go to. Leave 17 year old at home and let 15 year old invite a friend. Or you take 3 of your friends and have a good time.", "NTA, they are your tickets, she can't demand you not go, let alone ask for a friend to come for free!\n\nAs other have said if she doesn't want to go with you, take the younger sister and two other people, or get a full refund.  Tell your husband you aren't making him choose, if she doesn't want to go he can stay home and do something with her.\n\nIf you had a good relationship before is it possible to sit down and discuss together, either with her dad & sister there or just her.\n\nDoes the 15 year old sister have any insight?\n\nDo you think she was holding out hope of her parents getting back together?", "NTA. I\u2019d take the 15 year old and leave dad and 17year old home. Sell the other 2 tickets. \nDad is out of line and totally wrong on this one.", "Ya the moment she demanded you not go you stopped being the bad guy she\u2019s being a brat", "NTA... that 17yr is a spoiled brat...", "Nta, time to smack that entitled 17 year old behavior down. If you back down, the 17 year old will walk all over you for the rest of your life. Next it might be demanding you to leave a family vacation or holidays, then it could be a milestone like graduation or wedding. Maybe approach it differently and have your husband talk to her to see why she is resentful to you. This might be better suited for a therapist.", "NTA.  How about you leave hubby at home with the 17 yr old, take the 15yr old and each of you take a friend.  Considering you paid for the tickets,  based on 17yr olds behaviour and hubby's unwillingness to tell her that her behaviour is unnacceptable, neither of them deserve to go.\n\nEdit to add:  Do not give up your ticket. Regardless of what your husband says.  If he tried to tell me I had to give up a ticket I paid for, in these circumstances the next thing he would receive from me is divorce papers.", "NTA. Find friends to go with. The kids and dad can stay home", "NTA. 17yo doesn't care about the show. She is making a power play.  It needs to be addressed, obviously, just like Dad's willingness to capitulate so easily at your expense.", "Why the fuck have you guys not gotten this kid into therapy?\n\nWhy have you not started family therapy?  \n\nSeriously", "NTA. This is so tricky. Your husband is definitely an AH for not sorting this out. 17yo sounds vengeful and needs intervention before it gets further out of hand. Talk to your husband and offer for him to buy the tickets from you cause personally, I wouldn\u2019t go if I\u2019m gonna end up going with someone who\u2019ll make me feel uncomfortable. Otherwise, invite 15yo and your own GFs or 15yo bestfriend and your husband and 17yo can spend their sookie time together.", "NTA I definitely think your husband is allowing his daughter to be a bully and he\u2019s not willing to fight with either of you so he\u2019s letting you be the bad guy. This is the time for him to be the parent. If anything, your husband is the AH. He should have run it by you before even speaking to the kids about it. \n\nYou should absolutely go, no doubt about that, but do not give into this behavior. I have a sister who\u2019s very much \u201cmy way of the highway\u201d and at 25 she\u2019s almost completely burned bridges with my entire family this way. \n\nYour step daughter is holding onto some anger that needs to be dealt with and she needs to face reality, but regardless, you spent the money and you get to go no matter what.", "NTA. She's an entitled brat.  Leave them all home and take a few of your friends or even go solo, or just you and your husband. \n\nThat said, be prepared to live with this behavior as it will not change if dad doesn't enforce some boundaries and rules.", "NTA - tell the brat she's not going and invite one of your friends.", "*NTA*,\n\nYour stepdaughter is definitely out of line here.\n\nThese are tickets YOU paid for, inviting hubby and two other people. The other two couldn't come so you graciously invited your stepdaughters.\n\n17yo stepdaughter has nothing else. If she didn't want to go with you, okay, but she doesn't get to dictate what YOU do with YOUR stuff. \n\nAnd your husband is an AH by enabling that behavior. She can be frustrated, it doesn't mean she's always right when she's upset. And here, she's not. \n\nYou are not making him choose between you and stepdaughter, your stepdaughter did so.\n\nAs I said elsewhere, since these are your tickets, I'd keep one (or two, to invite 15yo stepdaughter) and sell what's left to other people who would most likely be pleased to get their hands on those tickets. \n\nYour husband forfeited his right by enabling his daughter, stepdaughter hers by playing stupid mind games, so she gets to win stupid prizes.\n\nAnd if 17yo stepdaughter does a temper tantrum over that, point her to my very answer, I will be more than happy to tell her how many ways she was wrong, even if she legitimately can be annoyed by your relationship with her father.", "NTA, but I feel like we're missing some key information. Why does your DIL hate you so much? It's one thing to not be the biggest fan of your step parent...but this is on another level", "Your hubby is a wuss, time for him to stand up to the 17 yo, why us he allowing her to control this situation, does she not know you purchased the tickets? Let's look into your future, she is getting married, tells Daddio you're  not invited, has children, you have  to leave the house or she won't visit or let him know the grandchildren, Christmas time, she's hosting, Daddio must attend, you're not invited, is this the future you want for yourself, is that the future your hubby is willing to sacrifice your relationship for?", "NTA-Your eldest stepdaughter needs to learn that she\u2019s not always going to get her way in life and ultimatums rarely turn out well.", "Based on the edit, NTA. Tbh you weren't TA even before the edit, but there was at least an argument that maybe you could bow out this time. The 17yo is literally already going to see the show that same exact weekend soo.. idk how soon the show is, but maybe her dad can talk about enrolling them in some therapy sessions before then to see if they can talk about what the issue is, like family therapy or something. Just so there's an unbiased third party to help facilitate and redirect yknow. Goodluck!", "NTA...your husband is..\n\nThe 17 year old is testing the relationship. If your husband gives in, it will become a normal behaviour. She is being manipulative. If you stay home she will always be coming between you & your husband.  She will realize she can control him by having a tantrum.\nYou've never gone. You spent the money. Take the 15 year old & one of her friends instead. Or take a friend of yours. \n\nThe 17 year old needs counselling to deal with her anger & behaviour. Things will get worse as she gets older if this is not fixed now.", "NTA - I agree with others that say it's your money.  Perhaps if you're to stay home your husband can reimburse you all of your money.  Then, because 17F is taking a friend, he can fork out for another ticket for 15F to take a friend, seeing as he is not just prioritising 17F over you, he is also putting you lower than her bestie.\n\nNext time, get two tickets, split the cost with your bestie and go with them instead.", "NTA", "This is tricky, especially not knowing what, if anything, has been done since your engagement to help mend the relationship. \n\nINFO: when your husband brought this up with his daughters how did you not come up? If he had said \"exciting news! OP got tickets to X and she wants to take you two\" this never could have started. How did it even get to this point? Your husband might be the ahole for how he let it get to this point.\n\nIt's also hard to know if 17yo is just so hurt she can't seem to handle her feelings or if there has been a precedent set that if 17yo threatens to withhold love she gets her way.\n\nMaybe if dad wants to take 17yo's BFF so much he should overpay for 3 more tickets, BFF of 17 and 15(fair is fair) can go with dear old dad and you can take a friend so you can enjoy the show with them. Dad will still owe you but at least then we are looking at an option that doesn't leave anyone out in the cold.\n\nETA: NTA, but you are NOT making him choose between you and his daughter. He's decided to view it that way.", "NTA.", "NTA. Based on the title, I was going to say YTA, but she is being a little brat. You bought the tickets, and invited her, but now she is demanding you not go? She is entitled", "NTA. Leave your husband and the elder daughter at home.

I spent over $2.5k from my personal account on those tickets and have no interest in missing this show, I've made thar clear to my husband, but I'm willing to not speak to 17yo if that's what she wants so she'll chill and just go with us. 17yo is sticking firm with if I go she will not. My husband thinks me and 17yo are both being unreasonable, but me more because I'm an adult and he feels I'm putting a few thousand dollars above his relationship with his daughter and the show comes around every few years or so and I'll have other chances to go. (If it matters, the kids have been before, this would be my first time.) 17yo because she's completely unwilling to compromise and it's either her way or nothing and my husband feels like if he doesn't take her after telling her about the tickets and getting 17yo and 15yo excited it could ruin his relationship with 17yo. \n\nIt's at a stalemate right now and I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong or not. Husband is frustrated I'm putting him in a difficult position. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But it's not too late to try to repair your relationship with her like your comment implies.", "NTA. Does that brat even know YOU paid?

Stepdaughter needs to grow up and recognize gadgets she is not in a valid position to make decisions about the disposition if the tickets, and neither does her father/your husband.

Another option is you go, bring your 15year old SD and decide what you will do with the other two tickets - sell it if someone is willing to buy it. Another option is just bring any of your three friends who will be available on that day.", " NTA take some friends and go. He can stay home with his kids.

It sounds like the 17yo hopes to become accustomed to her father enabling her narcissistic entitlement and guilting you into being his accomplice.  The time to nail that bs on the head and refuse to play those games is now.  **You** paid for the tickets so **you** will be going.  If 17yo wants to go with her bff then 17yo needs to spend her own money and buy a ticket for her bff (and herself if yours are not good enough).", "NTA. Stand firm on this. The older daughter is a brat.", "NTA. If your husband persists of treading on eggshells around the 17 year old and refusing to parent, then tell them both they can stay home and keep each other company and go with the 15 year old.

From your comments you seem very unconcerned about the fact that these are YOUR tickets and your 17yo may or may not know that. You bought them. Are we missing some info here on where this money came from??  If you bot them, NO ONE gets to decide who gets to use the tickets except you. And why would you ever encourage this awful behavior of both your husband and daughter by entertaining the idea of letting them use the tickets YOU PAID FOR without you?  Stand up for yourself. You do the inviting. They accept or decline. Period.

You suck because you're only just now dealing with this problem . Your husband's almost adult daughter sucks because she thinks that she can use an emotional blackmail to get what she wants. You all need to sit down and have an adult conversation about this. If you really can't deal with the situation then you're going to have to be the adult and suck it up and not go but your stepdaughter doesn't get to go either. \n\nAlso I just like to include she definitely has some grounds for being upset here because you didn't buy these tickets for her, you got them for someone else and the kids were simply an afterthought when that didn't work out.", "ESH.

Tbh, I don't think she'd care either way.", "15yo wants 17yo to move on and have things be normal. 17yo is super close to bio mom, who is very manipulative and until we got engaged didn't take the relationship seriously, but once hubby and I got engaged bio mom flipped out and started saying, he doesn't care anymore, he's moved on, he's chosen someone else, he's starting a new family, etc about my husband.", "They don't primarily live with us. 17yo will be 18 in a few months and we can't exactly force bio mom to take 17yo to therapy", "I'm wondering if 17F has always held out hope that Mom and Dad would get back together.  An engagement, then marriage rules that out.", "Pretty sure it's to do with bio mom and 17yo being easily manipulated.

Like, that's one of the those situations where AH doesnt quite do it justice IMO.\n\nWhile I assume the hubby is just sick of the stuff between them, it's insane he's not putting the 17 year old in her place for not being a complete and utter AH.\n\nNTA OP", "And please tell me what I did wrong?", "So I should just take the loss and maybe get myself a single ticket the next time the show comes around in a few years?", "We don't even have the kids the weekend of the show.

Just curious.\n\nEdit to add: OP answered elsewhere, not Taylor Swift tickets.", "Probably.

It sounds like biomom didn't take the marriage well. 17yo likely feels like she is betraying her mom if she accepts stepmom. The 17yo cannot help that mom is in her ear being petty and she isn't old enough yet to understand that her own mother might emotionally manipulate her. None of that is the kid's fault. If dad knows his ex is saying things that make the 17yo feel caught in the middle and failed to get her into therapy  that is also on him.  He could have handled much of this better.", "You didn't do anything wrong. His daughter is playing the brat to get her way trying to issue an ultimatum.

You have done everything you can, you have no obligation to kiss this girls ass.", "I don\u2019t think they are saying YTA or that you did anything wrong here, they are just saying that parents will typically always side with their kids even if you\u2019re totally in the right.

They can reimburse you for the ticket. Then you buy a ticket with that money and go!! His daughter and her friend are not entitled to your money.", "This is simple, just not easy. She is making an ultimatum and you are not. That alone should be enough for your husband to side with you. This isn't about his love for his daughter but his tolerance of her terrible and threatening behavior. If you and him give in to this terrorist demand, it will NEVER END. You will have taught her that she can terrorize the two of you and hold the family's happiness hostage in order to get anything she wants.

So, your husband wants you to give up tickets *you paid for,* for a show she\u2019s already going to see? Um. No. Absolutely not. \n\nEven if that wasn\u2019t the case, you in no way should have to give up tickets *you paid for.* Full stop. Your husband is allowing a 17 year old to make absurd demands. His approach to this is completely backwards. \n\nAt this point, I\u2019d sell two then go with a friend. Problem solved. \n\nNTA and the fact that your husband is somehow making you responsible for all this nonsense is troubling. Somebody needs to rein his daughter in, but that somebody is not you. \n\nIf he\u2019s still not getting it, show him this post and our responses. Maybe that will clear up his confusion because honestly? This should have never gotten to this point.", "Well when I posted that OP hadn't said her stepdaughter was going to the show regardless. Of course parents have a right to date night (that is why I said her husband was TA) .  But it's also an AH move to say \"Hey you know that show you really want to go to? Yeah I'm going to go with someone else and your not included\"  \n\nOf course that's not what happened here. OP is actually saying \"Hey you know that show you're already going to?

Doesn\u2019t matter, just curious.", "You think I should skip this time and find someone else to go with next time? You obviously think I'd be the bad guy to go and make 17yo miss the show.", "Agreed! The fact that the daughter is already going to the show without OP's involvement at all is very important!", "Pretty sure bio mom thought I was going to be a temporary thing as hubby would casually date different women for a while then move on before meeting me.", "No, simply take another of your friends and go there with your husband and potentially with other stepdaughter.\n\nThe 17yo is totally unreasonable.\n\nIf nothing works, find three people to buy your three other tickets and go on your own.\n\nReally, NTA.", "I'm reading it as take other people this time, leave the kids, and maybe even the husband,  home.", "No, you should go with friends this time.
