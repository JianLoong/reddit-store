In fact it's a very healthy thing to do. Mature adults can handle disappointment. Your parents do not sound mature, but that's their problem, you do not need to manage their feelings.\n\nFunny they are calling you entitled when they act like they are entitled to your time and virtual presence whenever they want.\n\nGood for you for standing up to them. It's not easy, but try not to let their guilting get to you.", "NTA\n\nI have a good relationship with my parents and I hate when they do this (I live abroad) with family I am close with. I often sit in my PJ\u2019s at home and a spontaneous video call is like unwanted guests barging in on me for a visit. With people I barely know, hell no thank you.", "NTA.  Sounds like it's past time your parents understand you're not a child they can force to do things. The entitled comment is a bit odd especially when they expect you to drop everything for them.  Doesn't matter if you are just sitting on the couch staring at the ceiling. The constant calling would annoy the crap out of me.", "NTA\n\nYou set a healthh boundary they didn't respect it. They tried to break you down, you stuck to your boundary. Now they're calling you entitled? Nah, that's projection. They're the entitled ones.\n\nThe entire point they're telling you this is to make you feel guilty in a hope you won't create healthy boundaries that don't cater to their demands. \n\nThey essentially want you to call and apologise for setting a healthy boundary.", "NTA\n\nYou are NOT a show pony. They  don't get to just trot you out and show you off  to friends just  because. \n\nAnd they could've texted  you that the friends wanted to see you and then let you make the call if  you wanted. But they made it seem like an emergency, which is misleading.", "NTA.\n\n>Anyway, I woke up to 5-6 missed calls from my mom. I texted her and asked if everything\u2019s okay and she said \u201ccall me.

And that\u2019s why I need to jump on a video call\n\nThis isn't enough to justify making you panic.\n\n>I get a call from my dad saying that I\u2019m horribly rude and entitled for disconnecting like that especially in front of others\n\nThey were the rude, entitled ones. You aren't a sideshow for the entertainment of people who haven't even seen you since you were five.", "NTA  I avoid video phone calls like the plague myself, zoom meetings or face time.  Yes they were most likely embarrassed in front of their friends, but that isn't your problem.  It wasn't urgent and hey should not have assumed that you would be OK with face time or whatever, with complete strangers to you.  They are being entitled.", "Your choice, not to take video calls on demand to be on display for your parents friends, is a moral one. Your mother was correct to say that the need for a chat was urgent (in that the need was immediate), but she neglected to mention that it wasn\u2019t important to you. In intentionally manipulating you, she was an AH. \n\nIn choosing not to take a non-important video call, you were not behaving in an unreasonable or immoral way, and your parents\u2019 expectation that their behavior was reasonable is best addressed the way you\u2019re doing it - by seeing new expectations. NTA", "INFO: are you a pet? A dog perhaps ?", "NTA. You\u2019re not a prop to be rolled out when mum and  dad want to. You just woke up, I would be crabby as all heck. They are not entitled to your time.\nAlso it was not an emergency at all.", "So let me summarize: as soon as you wake up, without having had time to wash and settle down, your mother demands that you make a video call with people you haven't seen in\u2026 30 years? You mention \"different countries\", so maybe there is also a different timezone?\n\n\rYeah, NTA and your mom's request is unreasonable. If she's always like this, it's no wonder your relationship is rocky.", "NTA-You are a person not a pet. You don\u2019t need to perform upon command. Yes, you can in fact just say no when you don\u2019t want to do something. It doesn\u2019t matter how long it\u2019s been since their guests have seen you and your parents really don\u2019t have leeway to call you rude.", "NTA\n\nYou're an adult with your own life. Not some prized pony to be pranced around in front of guests. A picture would have been more than sufficient.", "NTA Your parents should really have given you a heads-up or discussed this with you the previous day oslt. It's also really poor form to say that things are \"urgent\" when they're not.\n\nBut you also could have and should have handled things better esp. if you knew that your parents' guests were listening in. You could have been more diplomatic and told them a white lie that you're running really late or that your connection is poor.  I don't know which culture your parents are from but for many, face is very important. Many parents also live vicariously through their kids.\n\nFrom now on, schedule all calls with your parents via text or IM and train them to do the same with you. A simply 'ping': \"Are you free? Shall I call?\" just before the call is usually all that's needed.\n\nI suggest that you accept some fault and make up with your parents. Ask them to give you a heads-up next time and not just put you on the spot. And definitely explain to them that \"urgent\" should only be used for \"urgent\" matters. Tell them the parable of the boy who cried wolf :|\n\nI hope things work out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There is a lot of toxicity in your parents behavior. Your Mom is trying to exert control she has lost by your move. This is your chance to create a healthier life.
