Till I was 20-ish it was pretty rough but for the last few years we\u2019ve been trying to mend it. Somedays I can talk to her for an hour and it\u2019ll go fine but mostly we just talk for 10 mins and are arguing half the time. \n\nAnyway, I woke up to 5-6 missed calls from my mom. I texted her and asked if everything\u2019s okay and she said \u201ccall me. It\u2019s urgent!\u201d So I thought something bad happened. I call her and she tells me that they have some guests over and this couple hadn\u2019t seen me since I was 5 years old and wanted to see what I looked like. And that\u2019s why I need to jump on a video call rn. \n\nSo I responded with \u201cumm\u2026just show them a picture or a video\u201d and to this my mum responded - \u201cyeah but that doesn\u2019t work. They want to see your face and see what you look like\u201d. I said \u201cno\u201d and my folks said something like \u201cthese people haven\u2019t seen you in years and you can\u2019t just say no.\u201d At this point I got pissed and cut the call. Mum called me 3-4 more times. \n\nThen, I get a call from my dad saying that I\u2019m horribly rude and entitled for disconnecting like that especially in front of others. Mum is mad and isn\u2019t talking to me. Dad is being a little passive aggressive and distant. From past experiences, this is his way of expressing disappointment. \n\nAnd now I feel kinda guilty and like a bad person (although I won\u2019t tell them I feel that way). \n\nI admit video calling is no biggie and I just didn\u2019t want to video call.

In fact it's a very healthy thing to do. Mature adults can handle disappointment. Your parents do not sound mature, but that's their problem, you do not need to manage their feelings.\n\nFunny they are calling you entitled when they act like they are entitled to your time and virtual presence whenever they want.\n\nGood for you for standing up to them. It's not easy, but try not to let their guilting get to you.", "NTA\n\nI have a good relationship with my parents and I hate when they do this (I live abroad) with family I am close with. I often sit in my PJ\u2019s at home and a spontaneous video call is like unwanted guests barging in on me for a visit. With people I barely know, hell no thank you.", "NTA.  Sounds like it's past time your parents understand you're not a child they can force to do things. The entitled comment is a bit odd especially when they expect you to drop everything for them.  Doesn't matter if you are just sitting on the couch staring at the ceiling. The constant calling would annoy the crap out of me.", "NTA\n\nYou set a healthh boundary they didn't respect. They tried to break you down, you stuck to your boundary. Now they're calling you entitled? Nah, that's projection. They're the entitled ones.\n\nThe entire point of telling you this is to make you feel guilty in a hope you won't create healthy boundaries that don't cater to their demands. \n\nThey essentially want you to call and apologise for setting a healthy boundary.", "NTA\n\nYou are NOT a show pony. They  don't get to just trot you out and show you off  to friends just  because. \n\nAnd they could've texted  you that the friends wanted to see you and then let you make the call if  you wanted. But they made it seem like an emergency, which is misleading.", "NTA.\n\n>Anyway, I woke up to 5-6 missed calls from my mom. I texted her and asked if everything\u2019s okay and she said \u201ccall me. It\u2019s urgent!\u201d\n\nAny reasonable person would have been alarmed by this.\n\n>she tells me that they have some guests over and this couple hadn\u2019t seen me since I was 5 years old and wanted to see what I looked like. And that\u2019s why I need to jump on a video call\n\nThis isn't enough to justify making you panic.\n\n>I get a call from my dad saying that I\u2019m horribly rude and entitled for disconnecting like that especially in front of others\n\nThey were the rude, entitled ones. You aren't a sideshow for the entertainment of people who haven't even seen you since you were five.", "NTA  I avoid video phone calls like the plague myself, zoom meetings or face time.  Yes they were most likely embarrassed in front of their friends, but that isn't your problem.  It wasn't urgent and hey should not have assumed that you would be OK with face time or whatever, with complete strangers to you.  They are being entitled.", "Your choice, not to take video calls on demand to be on display for your parents friends, is a moral one. Your mother was correct to say that the need for a chat was urgent (in that the need was immediate), but she neglected to mention that it wasn\u2019t important to you. In intentionally manipulating you, she was an AH. \n\nIn choosing not to take a non-important video call, you were not behaving in an unreasonable or immoral way, and your parents\u2019 expectation that their behavior was reasonable is best addressed the way you\u2019re doing it - by seeing new expectations. NTA", "INFO: are you a pet? A dog perhaps ?", "NTA. You\u2019re not a prop to be rolled out when mum and  dad want to. You just woke up, I would be crabby as all heck. They are not entitled to your time.\nAlso it was not an emergency at all.", "So let me summarize: as soon as you wake up, without having had time to wash and settle down, your mother demands that you make a video call with people you haven't seen in\u2026 30 years? You mention \"different countries\", so maybe there is also a different timezone?\n\n\rYeah, NTA and your mom's request is unreasonable. If she's always like this, it's no wonder your relationship is rocky.", "NTA-You are a person not a pet. You don\u2019t need to perform upon command. Yes, you can in fact just say no when you don\u2019t want to do something. It doesn\u2019t matter how long it\u2019s been since their guests have seen you and your parents really don\u2019t have leeway to call you rude.", "NTA\n\nYou're an adult with your own life. Not some prized pony to be pranced around in front of guests. A picture would have been more than sufficient.", "NTA Your parents should really have given you a heads-up or discussed this with you the previous day oslt. It's also really poor form to say that things are \"urgent\" when they're not.\n\nBut you also could have and should have handled things better esp. if you knew that your parents' guests were listening in. You could have been more diplomatic and told them a white lie that you're running really late or that your connection is poor.  I don't know which culture your parents are from but for many, face is very important. Many parents also live vicariously through their kids.\n\nFrom now on, schedule all calls with your parents via text or IM and train them to do the same with you. A simply 'ping': \"Are you free? Shall I call?\" just before the call is usually all that's needed.\n\nI suggest that you accept some fault and make up with your parents. Ask them to give you a heads-up next time and not just put you on the spot. And definitely explain to them that \"urgent\" should only be used for \"urgent\" matters. Tell them the parable of the boy who cried wolf :|\n\nI hope things work out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

What's rude is leaving someone a message saying to call because it's urgent when nothing urgent is happening.", "Not only are you NTA for what you did, but I would say their behavior is making what you did necessary. There is a lot of toxicity in your parents behavior. Your Mom is trying to exert control she has lost by your move. This is your chance to create a healthier life. If you let them blow through boundaries or guilt you into caving- you will deal with this toxicity throughout your adult life. If you ever want to get married- this issue will wreak havoc on your marriage. Don\u2019t wait until you have an upset partner forcing you to put boundaries down, do it now, for yourself.", "NTA.  They haven\u2019t seen you since you were 5 so you probably aren\u2019t that important to them. I imagine this is a scenario where your parents said oh you have to see OP. We\u2019ll call them right now. And the couple is saying no that\u2019s not necessary. Feeling awkward while your mom thinks is such a great idea. That\u2019s what I picture. The other couple probably didn\u2019t really care that much.", "YTA- I'd hazard a guess that mom was just excited and proud to show off her child to friends they haven't seen in a while. Was she over the top with the multi-calls and the insistence? Well, yeah, but even the parents of grown kids can get carried away. You said it wouldn't actually have bothered you to take the call, but instead you decided to be petty, hung up on your mother, and embarrassed her AND dad in front of friends. You owe them an apology.", "Thank you. \n\nSo a few months ago my folks went to some \u201castrologer\u201d and that person told them stuff like \u201cshe\u2019ll be super detached from you. She has a boyfriend who she\u2019s super attached to and she\u2019ll never be successful or educated. She\u2019ll abandon you and won\u2019t take care of you blah blah blah\u201d and since then they\u2019ve been spiralling a bit. It was bad before but this \u201cprophecy\u201d made it worse. \n\nGranted only the part about me being detached from them and attached to my partner is true. But come on! It\u2019s not a self fulfilling prophecy.", "\ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udd1d\ud83d\udd1d\nHonestly this. Some people don't understand that a video call is like walking into someone's house.  Maybe my hair is dirty, maybe my house is messy, maybe I don't like video calls in general and I need time to prepare.  Whatever the reason, it's not okay to force a person to video call.", "Thank you. I could never explain why I hate it when people video call. This is exactly why. You put it into words, perfectly", "I think so. When I was little (around 5-10 years old) I used to sing and dance a lot. So mum would force me to sing EVERYWHERE we went. I think the \u201cI have a show pony\u201d mentality just never left (her mind).", "Thank you. I honestly can\u2019t begin to explain how nice it feels to be validated when it comes to this. \n\nNow that I\u2019m in my late 20s I can stand up for what I want (without overtly crying). But when I was little, I HAD to do what mum said otherwise she\u2019d get insanely mad, call people and bitch about me, and everyone would take her side and ask me to be a better daughter. \n\nSo, TL:DR- Thanks for saying that! It\u2019s nice to hear it and not feel like the worst kid on the planet for once.", "Thank you! \nI\u2019ll call them today and try to sort things out. It becomes so taxing otherwise. \n\nI agree I was a bit rude considering I know how important their image is to them.", "Given the way they have treated you throughout your life, it's not surprising you will become detached from them. It probably will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.", "OP, I know this word is thrown around a lot on Reddit, but your answers to a lot of questions on this post make me wonder if your mom is a narcissist. There is a difference between non-clinical narcissism and diagnosable narcissistic personality disorder, it\u2019s possible she just has traits and wouldn\u2019t be fully diagnosed, or maybe she would meet the criteria for full diagnosis. I don\u2019t know. But it might be something to learn about. There is a sub r/NarcissisticAbuse you could check out.", "There is a term for those people that validate your mom\u2019s toxic behavior- flying monkeys. It might help to research how your mom developed flying monkeys around her and how she uses them. This topic has a lot of content online for research. It might help you reclaim some of the power you were never allowed to have as a child because she essentially used these individuals as weapons against you."]}
