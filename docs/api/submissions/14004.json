She wanted me to stay 3 days, 2 nights. I babysit a lot to supplement my income and was interested. For overnights, I always charge my usual rate for all waking hours and then a flat rate of $100/night while they\u2019re sleeping. This covers me still being on call. I can\u2019t leave the house and if the kids wake up, I\u2019ll tend to them.\n\nOverall, the price for those 3 days was going to be $840. Which I know is a lot but to me, this is a luxury service. I have 10 years of experience, am expected to clean, cook and drive her kids places, as well as sleep at their house. Unlike other jobs, I\u2019m basically working 3 days straight.\n\nWhen I told Claudia, she definitely had sticker shock. But when I broke down the price and she shopped around, she realized I was the cheaper option. I requested the time off work. I don\u2019t get PTO, but figured I was making more doing this than I would working 3 days at my other job, so I figured it\u2019d be worth it. \n\nI\u2019ve babysat in the months since so I can get to know the kids. I don\u2019t have a lot of communication with Claudia\u2019s husband, Rick. Last week, he was the one to relieve me and pay. He asked how much I was charging for the wedding weekend. When I told him, he was clearly uncomfortable. But he still said \u201cwe\u2019ll see you Friday.\u201d\n\nThis morning, I got a text from Claudia saying \u201chey, so Richard\u2019s decided he wants to take the kids to the wedding after all! We won\u2019t need you\u201d. I checked with my job and they have no need for me this weekend as they found coverage. Basically, I\u2019m out 3 days pay.\n\nI texted Claudia and said that she needed to pay me at minimum what I\u2019d make at work in those 3 days ($480). She told me I was being ridiculous and the whole point is they don\u2019t feel it\u2019s worth it to pay that much. I explained that I took the time off. We didn\u2019t have a contract which in hindsight was stupid. I know legally they don\u2019t have to and I\u2019d have no case.  I didn\u2019t say this, just said the right thing is for her to pay. I added if they had told me earlier and I was able to get those shifts back, it\u2019d be different. \n\nMy friend that recommended me to Claudia says I\u2019m being ridiculous.

A retainer will do 2 things; filter out the people who are squirrely by nature, and ensure you get a minimum pay, irrespective of how long the assignment is", "It isn't the couple's fault about the lost work days only because it isn't clear they (or at least Claudia) knew OP took time off work for this babysitting job. However, this was still a scheduled job that didn't happen so OP should be paid for that (as OP probably couldn't get a replacement babysitting job in such a short time). \n\nI'm only clarifying this because you posted about a written agreement for when OP has to take off work and I'm saying that shouldn't matter. Any babysitting gig of a certain time or money, such as overnight or over $100, needs to be in writing with agreement.", "OP didn\u2019t take PTO. The \u201cP\u201d in PTO stands for \u201cpaid\u201d. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t seem to work a salary job, they work shifts. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to not take shifts for 3 days and not get paid in shift work. It\u2019s not the same as someone at a desk job taking paid time off. She also doesn\u2019t say anywhere that her primary job is as a nanny.", "Your take on PTO might be the single dumbest thing I\u2019ve read on the internet in recent memory", "Do you have the agreement via text or email? Because that might be enough for small claims court and the filing fee is probably under $100. Might be worth it.", "NTA but It\u2019s a business, treat it like one.", "it is \"trust, but veirfy\". The contract protects you both. You should stop sitting for them for sure! NTA", "Even if this was a verbal contract, there was no mention of a cancellation fee. That wasn\u2019t in the contract. Take this as a lesson learned but YTA for surprising them with a cancellation fee", "if you use an app, website, or service, warn them about this couple.", "If you\u2019re in the US then legally you do have a leg to stand on. Oral contracts are binding and you have evidence that you relied on the deal to your detriment. You would almost certainly get the money if you took them to court", "Yep, see what you have in writing in texts and hope it is enough.", "But they said \"real people, real cases\" \ud83d\ude2d\nI can't believe this, first the government, now the TV is lying \ud83e\udd79", "I mean that part is true. They\u2019re real people and their cases are real, but that all happens before they show up to set \ud83d\ude02", "NAH.\n\nYou should have communicated better with them that you were still going to charge them if they cancelled and given them a deadline for canceling like most other businesses do.  \n\nIf you did not communicate to them that you were going to charge them, they have no obligation to pay you anything.\n\nAlso your rates are too high.  That's the same amount I pay for 2 children to attend a full-service daycare for a full week ffs.", "Do you have texts? People often don't consider that written evidence, but it is.", "ESH.  Demanding 3 days payment is too much.  A deposit or 1 days wage should have been pre-paid to reserve your time.  It was rude of her to cancel at last minute and she should have offered at least some money.", "NTA - so sorry this happened. Definitely a learning opp for future as others have said.\n\nI do find it super strange though that Claudia didn\u2019t tell Rick ahead of time about your price. That\u2019s on her. Sounds like Rick is a bit controlling but if she\u2019d been more upfront sooner with her husband you could have got that time back. What a strange relationship they must have for him to not have known? I always assume other couples talk about larger then normal financial investments?", "NTA. Hope it was worth it to them to lose a reliable sitter. You would be TA if you ever agreed to sit for them again, even with a contract. My dog sitter requires a 50% deposit and even if I did have to cancel last minute I have the decency to still pay her in full. She generally turns down other jobs once she books. It\u2019s common courtesy.", "NTA.  You will not get paid.  Chalk it up to 'lesson learned'.  In the future, require a non refundable deposit for your time.", "NTA. Try to get them to admit to your original deal in text and take it to small claims. \n\nTake it to claims anyway, but helps if you have it in writing not just a verbal contract.", "For what? I mean I think they\u2019re assholes but what could you possibly sue for that not only would make it to court, but would justify the fees associated with court?", "The thing is, I never had a cancellation policy because this has never happened before. I had one other family cancel semi-last minute, though for a regular date night job. They paid me in full, so I assumed it was customary.\n\nThe mom knew I took the time off. She's aware of my full time job and the fact that my hours vary week to week. I assured her that I'd specifically ask for those days off. She also knows my line of work (not childcare) which does not get PTO.", "Okay, and you also pick up your kids at the end of the day, right? I'm assuming they're there 9 hours at the most (used to work in one). That's 45 hours a week and mostly on the assumption that they're there that long. You may not send them the operating hours. Teachers likely get breaks or come in shifts. I would've been working 84 hours. On my own, own call. So even at night, I'm still responsible.\n\nI was supposed to watch these kids for 3 days straight. No breaks. No time off. Yes, they'd be asleep overnight but I was still expected to be there the entire time, tend to them when they were sick, etc.\n\nHonestly, it's pretty much a steal because I am not charging them my regular rate from when the kids fall asleep to when they wake up. In this case, kids went to bed at 8 PM and woke up at 7 AM. I had to wake up a littl earlier to make breakfast. Had I charged my regular rate, it would've been an extra $460 to their total or $230/night. Which would be ridiculous as reasonably, I'm going to do very little work in those 11 hours. Thus, just a simple flat rate of $100/night.\n\nAgain, this is a luxury service. You want someone to stay with your kids for 3 days and do pretty much everything you would do? It's not going to be cheap.\n\nI accept your judgement on me being an ass, but I won't accept you judging my prices and comparing it to daycare when it's not similar at all.", "I didn't demand the full amount. I said they could pay me nearly half of the quoted rate.", "I don't see the point here? They called you 24 hours before FF Friday, right? Where I live that is enough to cancel an appointment", "I did ask about this before I requested they pay me. I haven't been to too many weddings but I know everything is organized ahead of time.\n\nThe bride and groom apparently always wanted the kids there. They're putting the wedding on themselves and it's at a relative's house. So, it won't cost anything. It's just that the children's mom wanted a weekend away from the kids so she originally said they'd go alone.", "What are they getting that is luxury and beyond just normal expected babysitting duties?", "I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s worth it to mom, she knew husband would balk at the price and kept it secret. Turned out she was right, and now instead of enjoying herself at the wedding she\u2019ll be herding her kids all weekend. Want to bet dad will enjoy the weekend as if he was single and that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t want to pay $840 with no benefit to him?", "I understand being angry that they cancelled so late, but you also didn't give them a time frame that they needed to cancel by. It's not just the lack of written contract, but your lack of clarity on that point. You both handled it badly, so ESH.", "Oh dear.  Have to go with NAH -  You've learned what you need to do in the future - take a deposit and have clear terms about cancellation and refunds.  Since you didn't, they aren't assholes for thinking they can just cancel without penalties. Did they know you took time off from your job and won't get paid?  If they knew, they would be nicer people to give you something for those lost wages, even if not the full amount (they are probably going to have to pay sitters at the out of town location now).  I'm sorry, this is really your professional inexperience and you are the one who has to bear the cost of that this time.", "My \"day job\" is not a nanny. I work a job outside the childcare field. We do not get PTO. We can request time off, but it means we are not paid for those days. If I was a nanny, I definitely would not have called off for something like this, because as you said, backup care is a bitch. However, my actual job has plenty of people looking for hours. Thus why it was easy for my boss to fill my spot.", "They know I\u2019m missing out on wages and still not wont pay.", "If that\u2019s the case then I misunderstood. She mentioned her employer had found \u201ccoverage\u201d so I interpreted that as her being a career nanny.", "Well, one, most babysitters leave when the day/night is over. This is for 3 whole days. I don\u2019t know why you keep undermining that.\n\nI had to cook all 3 meals. Again. For 3 days. Drive the kids around, take them to activities. \n\nThey are asking me to give up being in my home and sleep in theirs and be on call while their children sleep. For 3 days. I got no breaks. Again, a regular sitter gets to go home by the end of the day.\n\n\nThe main luxury is: you are getting someone for more than a night. This isn\u2019t just, put the kids to bed, watch tv and raid the fridge (not that I do that for normal jobs but I think it\u2019s what a lot picture when they hear the word \u201cbabysitter\u201d). They are doing everything a parent would do for 3 days, with no breaks. That is a luxury.\n\nI\u2019ll always advocate for affordable childcare while the parents are at work. That\u2019s not a luxury. That\u2019s just getting by.\n\nBut wanting to go to a wedding without kids? A luxury. Not a bad one to want, but it\u2019s going to come at a hefty price when you are expecting someone to work for 3 days straight.\n\nI don\u2019t do overnights often, because it is a lot of money for the parents and a lot of work for me. I\u2019ve done them a handful of times. \n\nIf a family can\u2019t afford it/doesn\u2019t want to pay, that\u2019s fine. But it is more than reasonable. This isn\u2019t daycare or your typical sitting job. It is asking a lot of someone and you have to pay appropriately.", "She's a real arbitrator and her rulings are legally binding.", "YTA   \nIf you wanted a cancellation fee you should have sorted that out in advance.", "Small Claims Court is an option. You represent yourself, no lawyers are needed. Each side presents their case, which is just telling the judge what happened and showing any evidence.", "A cancellation fee would be laughed out of court if it wasn't specified in advance. There's nothing for OP to collect.", ">You did have a contract, it just wasn't in writing\n\nThere was no verbal agreement on cancellation fees.", "The point of a contract is that it's NOT cancelable unless there is a provision saying how to cancel it", "Where I'm from it costs like $100 to file a small claim. I'd do it because I would be super fucking riled up about this. Send them a text saying that you have experienced material loss due to their beach of your verbal contract and if you don't have $xxx in your account by [date], you will be filling suit in small claims.\n\nAnd then they'll have to cover the small claims fee on top of that. Whether you follow through is up to you.", "Well, used to be your friend...", "The dad doesn't care about that because dollars to donuts his weekend will be completely unaffected while his wife is run ragged"]}
