She wanted me to stay 3 days, 2 nights. I babysit a lot to supplement my income and was interested. For overnights, I always charge my usual rate for all waking hours and then a flat rate of $100/night while they\u2019re sleeping. This covers me still being on call. I can\u2019t leave the house and if the kids wake up, I\u2019ll tend to them.\n\nOverall, the price for those 3 days was going to be $840. Which I know is a lot but to me, this is a luxury service. I have 10 years of experience, am expected to clean, cook and drive her kids places, as well as sleep at their house. Unlike other jobs, I\u2019m basically working 3 days straight.\n\nWhen I told Claudia, she definitely had sticker shock. But when I broke down the price and she shopped around, she realized I was the cheaper option. I requested the time off work. I don\u2019t get PTO, but figured I was making more doing this than I would working 3 days at my other job, so I figured it\u2019d be worth it. \n\nI\u2019ve babysat in the months since so I can get to know the kids. I don\u2019t have a lot of communication with Claudia\u2019s husband, Rick. Last week, he was the one to relieve me and pay. He asked how much I was charging for the wedding weekend. When I told him, he was clearly uncomfortable. But he still said \u201cwe\u2019ll see you Friday.\u201d\n\nThis morning, I got a text from Claudia saying \u201chey, so Richard\u2019s decided he wants to take the kids to the wedding after all! We won\u2019t need you\u201d. I checked with my job and they have no need for me this weekend as they found coverage. Basically, I\u2019m out 3 days pay.\n\nI texted Claudia and said that she needed to pay me at minimum what I\u2019d make at work in those 3 days ($480). She told me I was being ridiculous and the whole point is they don\u2019t feel it\u2019s worth it to pay that much. I explained that I took the time off. We didn\u2019t have a contract which in hindsight was stupid. I know legally they don\u2019t have to and I\u2019d have no case.  I didn\u2019t say this, just said the right thing is for her to pay. I added if they had told me earlier and I was able to get those shifts back, it\u2019d be different. \n\nMy friend that recommended me to Claudia says I\u2019m being ridiculous. I pointed out that if I had cancelled this close, they\u2019d be reasonably pissed and screwed. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680630027, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bqh3o/aita_for_asking_to_be_paid_when_a_family_cancelled/", "score": 194, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They should pay you something to compensate you for the steps you took to make yourself available for them. You should consider coming up with a cancellation policy for future clients and require your clients to agree to your policy before you put their date in your calendar.

That might be your saving grace.\n\nMy credentials here - I\u2019m a dog walker who works independently and any time a sitting cancels last minute i charge 50%.
