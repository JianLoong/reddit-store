Sorry, I usually just read through this sub, but this happened and I've been wondering if I'm the asshole, so I decided to ask.\n\nSo, basically, I'm 24NB. My boyfriend (Fiance?) is 25M. My sister is 26F, and I don't know the ages of most of her friends, but roughly the same age.\n\nNow, my sister and my boyfriend/fiance do not get along well. I don't really know what happened. I think my sister is just upset because she has issues with commitment, and she dated him at their high school (I went to a different high school), and then cheated him, and is upset he broke up with her. I met him in college, and didn't know it was him.\n\nNow, what happened is, last week it was my sister's birthday. She was always into stupidly lavish things, we both are, so she threw a big birthday party at a venue in the forest.\n\nMe and my boyfriend/fiance were both invited. We've been dating for a few years and he's never been invited to one of my sister's birthday parties before, so we were both thrilled at this development.\n\nAt the party, my sister was busy opening all her presents, then eating cake, both of which we were there for. Afterward, my sister started talking to her friends, and the guests started to explore the area. It was stunning.\n\nMe and my boyfriend were a little bit away when we found a little clearing. We were still pretty close to the venue, but I think it was pretty private. My boyfriend thought so too.\n\nHe got down on one knee, and proposed. He didn't have a ring, he had one at home though, but he had woven a ring out of grass while we were walking (we are both very fidgety), so he put that on my finger after I said yes.\n\nApparently it wasn't as private as I thought, because when we got back to the venue after taking a selfie and scheduling a post for a few hours after the party was scheduled to end, I was bombarded by a shower of congratulations. Turns out my sister's friend, \"Lisa\", saw my boyfriend propose, and then came back to the venue and told everyone.\n\nI figured that I could show them the ring, and tell the story, and then move on from that and back to my sister. \n\nWhile I was being congratulated, another girl, one of my sister's best friends, came up to me, asked to see the ring, and told me that \"Wow, he even skimped out on a ring. He couldn't plan his own proposal, or get you a nice ring.\"\n\nI was upset, because I wasn't even planning to tell anyone. If someone noticed the ring, I would tell them, but I wasn't going to announce it to the world, or do it in public where everyone can see us.\n\nWe left immediately afterwards, and my entire family has been blowing up my phone calling me an attention seeking b-word, and that I shouldn't have done that to my sister.\n\nI'm worried I might be an asshole because it was my sister's birthday. and if I said no maybe she wouldn't have been upset about my boyfriend proposing.", "created_utc": 1679159074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11utscb/aita_for_saying_yes_to_my_boyfriends_proposal/", "score": 104, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I knew what happened, cause my BF (Fiance now, I guess), told me. But they seemed to get along great for a few months until she randomly just started hating him. So I'm not sure if being nice got too much or something else happened.", "This seals it for me too. The grass ring shows that he had no intention of doing this and then had a brainwave at the party. That means it is highly likely that this proposal was about the sister and not OP.  am going to say OP is at best naive and oblivious and at worst an AH.", "But she goes on to show them the ring and tell them the story and throws in that she doesn't get why they don't have a good relationship. I think that she should have just played the proposal down and it itches me that she threw in the sentence about not liking each other. And honestly yes it was the fiance and he shouldn't have done it but he also knew in some way that op wouldn't care about her sister's birthday and about her feelings, because otherwise he wouldn't have done it. That's at least the impression I got.", "Curios- when did your fianc\u00e9 mention he used to date her sister. Unless he is completely oblivious, he should have figured this out in the first few weeks of dating. \n\nThen he impromptu proposes at your sister\u2019s big party?  Seems like he has SERIOUS unresolved issues with your sister", "I mean maybe she thought that it will only be a fling between you and him and then realized that it is serious. Who knows maybe she is jealous. But to be honest I would never want to date someone my sister dated and I would not be okay if she dated someone I dated (not like we kissed or held hands, but someone I was intimate with or she was intimate with or had real feelings for). Would also be weird and also I think cause some sort of issues.", "It\u2019s not normal for siblings to date each other\u2019s exes under any circumstance. It\u2019s awkward and strange. You\u2019re just trying to justify in your head that it\u2019s not, cause you\u2019re doing it. There are 6 billion people on this planet and you have to pick 1 of a select few that your sister already dated. I can\u2019t believe your sister hasn\u2019t gone NC, I wouldn\u2019t want to be around anyone who has such a low level of loyalty.", "Is there any chance something happened between them while you were dating? Sorry, not trying to jump to that, but if things were okay and suddenly not, I\u2019d be wondering why. And after this I\u2019d be questioning whether he has unresolved feelings for your sister. \n\nI could be totally wrong and he could be a great guy, but some of this would have me thinking.", "1. He is dating his ex's sister. Who probably look somewhat similar and share a last name.\n2. The first time he is invited to an event of his ex, he proposes to someone else.", "Hence my maybe. Usually I am not on the side of the sibling that dates their siblings exes. But the sister indeed cheated, Op and partner didn't know, and the relationship happened when they (the sister and partner of op) were young. But I do can understand the sister not feeling happy about this.", "OP didn\u2019t know the connection. And apparently never mentioned sister, or had any photos anywhere", "Please ask your sister for her side of the story. I want to be wrong about your boyfriend but all his behaviour in this story screams bad news.", "If I were you, I\u2019d be very concerned that he made an inappropriate move on her and was rebuffed. Hence the about-face in their relationship. \n\nAlso, YTA for all the reasons stated by most people on this thread. It is so incredibly rude to hijack someone else\u2019s event like this. I don\u2019t care if you supposedly thought you were alone, it was his ex\u2019s bday party. So gross.", "Thanks, that are exactly my questions/thoughts. I find it very unlikely, that he did not know about OP being the sister. Plus it is cery sketchy to ask at the very first time being invited to the birthday.", "Thank you! If they don't get along, why would he want the birthday party of his ex being a part of the proposal story? Whenever someone asks how he proposed, the birthday party will be a part it!", "Thank you! I know a few ppl whove dated pr married a siblings ex and its just ick to me", "Oh, how silly of me to think you might provide some actual insight into this situation. All you have is two assumptions that, even if they're correct, don't give any actual insight into the bf's motivations", "Obviously they found out eventually, but by then it seems they had already dated a while which does change the situation.", "I suspect BF made the connection pretty quickly and didn\u2019t tell OP. If OP had any family photos up, or on her social media, wherever, how did BF miss them?  It\u2019s been a while since college (and dating) but within a week or two I think they would have mentioned home towns and siblings. \n\nObviously I could be wrong since I\u2019m basing this all on a single post."]}
