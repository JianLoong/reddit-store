Sorry, I usually just read through this sub, but this happened and I've been wondering if I'm the asshole, so I decided to ask.\n\nSo, basically, I'm 24NB. My boyfriend (Fiance?) is 25M. My sister is 26F, and I don't know the ages of most of her friends, but roughly the same age.\n\nNow, my sister and my boyfriend/fiance do not get along well. I don't really know what happened. I think my sister is just upset because she has issues with commitment, and she dated him at their high school (I went to a different high school), and then cheated him, and is upset he broke up with her. I met him in college, and didn't know it was him.\n\nNow, what happened is, last week it was my sister's birthday. She was always into stupidly lavish things, we both are, so she threw a big birthday party at a venue in the forest.\n\nMe and my boyfriend/fiance were both invited. We've been dating for a few years and he's never been invited to one of my sister's birthday parties before, so we were both thrilled at this development.\n\nAt the party, my sister was busy opening all her presents, then eating cake, both of which we were there for. Afterward, my sister started talking to her friends, and the guests started to explore the area. It was stunning.\n\nMe and my boyfriend were a little bit away when we found a little clearing. We were still pretty close to the venue, but I think it was pretty private. My boyfriend thought so too.\n\nHe got down on one knee, and proposed. He didn't have a ring, he had one at home though, but he had woven a ring out of grass while we were walking (we are both very fidgety), so he put that on my finger after I said yes.\n\nApparently it wasn't as private as I thought, because when we got back to the venue after taking a selfie and scheduling a post for a few hours after the party was scheduled to end, I was bombarded by a shower of congratulations. Turns out my sister's friend, \"Lisa\", saw my boyfriend propose, and then came back to the venue and told everyone.\n\nI figured that I could show them the ring, and tell the story, and then move on from that and back to my sister. \n\nWhile I was being congratulated, another girl, one of my sister's best friends, came up to me, asked to see the ring, and told me that \"Wow, he even skimped out on a ring. He couldn't plan his own proposal, or get you a nice ring.\"\n\nI was upset, because I wasn't even planning to tell anyone. If someone noticed the ring, I would tell them, but I wasn't going to announce it to the world, or do it in public where everyone can see us.\n\nWe left immediately afterwards, and my entire family has been blowing up my phone calling me an attention seeking b-word, and that I shouldn't have done that to my sister.\n\nI'm worried I might be an asshole because it was my sister's birthday. and if I said no maybe she wouldn't have been upset about my boyfriend proposing.", "created_utc": 1679159074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11utscb/aita_for_saying_yes_to_my_boyfriends_proposal/", "score": 436, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you'd said no, that might have caused just as much of a scene as saying yes.\n\nBut still, I think it's a dick move to use someone else's lavish party as an opportunity to propose unless it's with the knowledge and approval of the person whose party it is. The whole thing is tainted now: did he pick that place and that moment just to piss off your sister who cheated on him? I'm not saying he did, but sometimes people's perception of an event matters more than the truth of it. He could have planned something really special and meaningful for the two of you, simultaneously avoiding antagonizing your sister, and ... he didn't. That's a pretty crappy way to treat both you and your sister.", "Obviously YTA.  Why would he have done it in a alley near the party that you are going back too.  He didn\u2019t have a ring, it seems obvious he did this because it was your sisters party.", "YTA you haven\u2019t bothered to really understand the animosity between your bf and sister and are content to assume the entire problem rests with your sister. You\u2019ve never tried to ask her and really understand because it\u2019s easier than realizing your bf might be flawed. \n\nThings were ok, then your sister got upset? Did it occur to you that they had a private conversation without you and she has a legitimate grievance?  Wait, can\u2019t, there might be a flaw.\n\nShe invited you both to a lavish party at a venue I assume is pretty pricey. By your own descriptions guests were all exploring the area and you weren\u2019t far from the party. I wouldn\u2019t have had an expectation of privacy while outdoors. You were seen and her birthday became an impromptu engagement party for you. Scheduling the selfie for later would still make it obvious you got engaged at her party and borrowed her venue to make your engagement fancy. You then thought you\u2019d show off the ring and tell your proposal story. And then? That basically wraps up a party. It was not the time and place to tell your \u201cstory of us\u201d\n\nYTA", "YTA. Your fiance hijacked your sister, his ex's, party to propose to you, and you became the center of attention upon returning to the party. You even wore a ring, grass or not, back to the parry. In what universe are you and your fiance not TA in your mind? Claiming \"I didn't plan to announce it at the party\" does not make you or your fiance less of an AH.", "Your fiance is TA. You don't propose at someone else's party. Full stop.", "You know the rules right? It was someone else's event. He was an asshole for proposing there. You were the asshole for telling everyone about it. YTA", "YTA and I\u2019ll never understand how some people have no problem dating a sibling\u2019s ex. And then you get engaged at her birthday party?!?!?! Who needs enemies when you have family like that", "YTA!", "YTA.", "This is a mess. I am also, though I'm not sure which one, pretty sure I saw the other side of this (idk if it's fake or not w/e honestly) as a post the other day. It is ridiculous you don't understand why there as an issue with your sister, ridiculous what your bf did, and ridiculous you aren't confused with the timing. I wouldn't want to be near any of this.", "NTA for this. But, you are TA for dating your sister\u2019s ex, and your boyfriend is TA for proposing to you there. Your sister\u2019s friend is also TA for doing what she did, and your family sounds like a bunch of assholes. This whole thing is just a weird situation.", "Nta. \nPeople seriously need to grow up. First world problems.", "NTA you shouldn't propose at a wedding, but a birthday party is fair game. It's just a party. Birthdays aren't some deep meaningful thing. You can propose, announce pregnancies...anything really.", "Hooo boy, looks like people are sure tearing into you over this one, OP.\n\nBut you know what? I'm voting NTA. You two happened to be at someone's birthday party, when he decided to ask you to marry him. He didn't do it at the table, in the middle of the crowd. He did it when you two were off on your own, and you set the social media to only reveal what had happened after the festivities had ended.\n\nRegarding his \"placeholder ring\", the person who commented about him cheaping out, can go screw themselves. Marriage is about loving one another, not about spending money on a ring. What did she expect? That you'd base your answer on how much he spent on the ring? I mean you said your sister loves expensive and lavish things, so it's no real surprise that she's surrounded herself with other gold diggers.\n\nRegarding him being her ex from high schoo, I really couldn't give a rat's arse. If they only dated a couple of months and she'd cheated on him, it sounds like she is likely to have dated half the guys in town. Sounds like she cheated, got caught, got exposed and is resentful that he knows she's the village bicycle.\n\nCongratulations on your relationship heading for the next step. Her, all her friends, and everyone giving you a heavy handed negative judgement, can piss right off.", "There\u2019s absolutely no way you don\u2019t know YTA for getting engaged at your sister\u2019s birthday, to her ex boyfriend. Come on.", "Your fianc\u00e9e is a massive asshole for proposing to his exes sister at her birthday party, a party that it sounds like she wanted to invite the both of you to to bury the hatchet. You were put into a shitty situation by him and he owes your sister an apology, if I were you I probably would've apologized to your sister and bailed once I realized that everyone knew. \n\nNTA, but your fianc\u00e9e is a moron.", "Both you AND your boyfriend are AHs\n\nYou don't propose to someone at someone else's event. He decided to do that, so he's an AH for that. You're an AH because you went along with it instead of shutting it down.", "NTA you didn't know he was going to propose and even if you did it's a birthday party your sister needs to get over herself", "Even more pathetic is this:\n\n>We've been dating for a few years and he's **never been invited to one of my sister's birthday parties before**, so we were both thrilled at this development.\n\nThe FIRST TIME he's invited by her sister, in an act that could be seen as a metaphorical olive branch, he decides that yes, this is ALSO the perfect time to propose spontaneously (sans ring). It reeks of self-centeredness.", "See I don\u2019t actually think OP is the victim, I think she\u2019s being intentionally obtuse. There\u2019s no way in hell I\u2019d date anyone after my sister did, even if she cheated on him/dumped him/ didn\u2019t value him\u2026doesn\u2019t matter, there\u2019s just boundaries that I respect for the people I love the most in my life (my family) but I come from a really nice family where all siblings are like best friends.

As OP tells us their sister cheated on the guy she used to date, we don't even know that the (whole) truth. And not recognizing the sisters ex at college? Really?

But he chose in the middle of a party and a place that was clearly not private.. it\u2019s super suspect because basically the boyfriend just put her in this impossible position of \u201clet\u2019s have this private moment that is important to you, but you can\u2019t tell anybody about it\u201d that\u2019s not a private moment, that\u2019s a set up", "Meh, i honestly don't care that much. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nBut you do, so go fight the fight, buddy! Good luck!", "only op is non binary.

The friend was Eavesdropping on a conversation that wasn't hers, and Announced business that wasn't hers, to the crowd-- rude, no matter how you frame it.\n\nAnd honestly, calling him the sister's ex is REALLY a stretch. Two months, in highschool, when they're college graduates now? They're both entirely different people now. The sister doesn't own him forever just because they had a brief thing in highschool that she fucked up by cheating on him.", "Oh yes, I\u2019m saying that OP is an asshole but that\u2019s no reason to misgender them.", "Genuine question, is it to be presumed that all NB people use they/them pronouns? I'm old, but I identify with the NB gender and still use she/her pronouns.

Dude. You are marrying into a family and now you are doing something socially awkward and upsetting the family when you could have chose any other night of the year.

We don't know OP's pronouns, but we do know they're nonbinary and so they/them is the respectful option until they clarify otherwise?", "It's a safer assumption to make than assuming he or her pronouns (especially since we don't know if OP is more masculine or feminine presenting) but non-binary people can use any pronouns and still be nonbinary", "Right?! That's crazy town for me!", "Thank you. I agree, assuming genders is icky. People online always assume I'm a dude. Which I don't mind, but it is interesting.", "I can understand that.
