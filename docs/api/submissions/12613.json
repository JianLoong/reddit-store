Sorry, I usually just read through this sub, but this happened and I've been wondering if I'm the asshole, so I decided to ask.\n\nSo, basically, I'm 24NB. My boyfriend (Fiance?) is 25M. My sister is 26F, and I don't know the ages of most of her friends, but roughly the same age.\n\nNow, my sister and my boyfriend/fiance do not get along well. I don't really know what happened. I think my sister is just upset because she has issues with commitment, and she dated him at their high school (I went to a different high school), and then cheated him, and is upset he broke up with her. I met him in college, and didn't know it was him.\n\nNow, what happened is, last week it was my sister's birthday. She was always into stupidly lavish things, we both are, so she threw a big birthday party at a venue in the forest.\n\nMe and my boyfriend/fiance were both invited. We've been dating for a few years and he's never been invited to one of my sister's birthday parties before, so we were both thrilled at this development.\n\nAt the party, my sister was busy opening all her presents, then eating cake, both of which we were there for. Afterward, my sister started talking to her friends, and the guests started to explore the area. It was stunning.\n\nMe and my boyfriend were a little bit away when we found a little clearing. We were still pretty close to the venue, but I think it was pretty private. My boyfriend thought so too.\n\nHe got down on one knee, and proposed. He didn't have a ring, he had one at home though, but he had woven a ring out of grass while we were walking (we are both very fidgety), so he put that on my finger after I said yes.\n\nApparently it wasn't as private as I thought, because when we got back to the venue after taking a selfie and scheduling a post for a few hours after the party was scheduled to end, I was bombarded by a shower of congratulations. Turns out my sister's friend, \"Lisa\", saw my boyfriend propose, and then came back to the venue and told everyone.\n\nI figured that I could show them the ring, and tell the story, and then move on from that and back to my sister. \n\nWhile I was being congratulated, another girl, one of my sister's best friends, came up to me, asked to see the ring, and told me that \"Wow, he even skimped out on a ring. He couldn't plan his own proposal, or get you a nice ring.\"\n\nI was upset, because I wasn't even planning to tell anyone. If someone noticed the ring, I would tell them, but I wasn't going to announce it to the world, or do it in public where everyone can see us.\n\nWe left immediately afterwards, and my entire family has been blowing up my phone calling me an attention seeking b-word, and that I shouldn't have done that to my sister.\n\nI'm worried I might be an asshole because it was my sister's birthday. and if I said no maybe she wouldn't have been upset about my boyfriend proposing.", "created_utc": 1679159074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11utscb/aita_for_saying_yes_to_my_boyfriends_proposal/", "score": 255, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So I'm not sure if being nice got too much or something else happened.", "This seals it for me too. The grass ring shows that he had no intention of doing this and then had a brainwave at the party.

I think that she should have just played the proposal down and it itches me that she threw in the sentence about not liking each other. And honestly yes it was the fiance and he shouldn't have done it but he also knew in some way that op wouldn't care about her sister's birthday and about her feelings, because otherwise he wouldn't have done it. That's at least the impression I got.", "Curios- when did your fianc\u00e9 mention he used to date her sister.

High schoolers also sometimes I really bananas ideas of what is cheating and what is not because they haven\u2019t had mature conversations about boundaries in a relationship. I say all this not because I\u2019m trying to defend the cheaters or whatever, but it is clear throughout this post that OP has some kind of contempt toward her sister. Supposedly the sister has commitment, problems and cheated, and her fianc\u00e9 immediately dumped her and that is why she doesn\u2019t like him? Who exactly did OP get that story from, her sister or her fianc\u00e9? She also dated this guy in high school, where OP certainly should have been around the house during that time, so how did she not know that it was him?
