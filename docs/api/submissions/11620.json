I don't think you're wrong for defending yourself here, but if you are intending to be long-term partners with this person, you need to start viewing it as a partnership, which may me that sometimes you need to compromise. To me, as long as you buying this TV won't impact you being able to contribute what you both decide on for the long-term financial goals (ie. buying that house), then that should be enough, but end of the day, it's really just the two of you in the relationship that can decide what's fair and what's not.", "Good for you but that\u2019s not the topic or what the op is asking.", "I will jump on and add - emergency savings should ideally be 6-12 months of your income, so spending a significant amount of your savings on a television doesn't jibe with common sense financial guidelines - especially if you are looking to buy a house in the near future (less than 5 years away).\n\nWhat if that big expensive television doesn't fit the house you want to buy?\n\nSometimes good for now is a better way to spend funds.
