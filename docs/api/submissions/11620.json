You have \u00a3300 per month to put into your savings which on one hand is great, but on the other hand may indicate that your monthly expenses aren't that far away from your monthly salary. \n\nIn an ideal world, everyone should have an emergency fund of 6-12 months of expenses saved so that you can maintain your lifestyle for 6-12 months if you lose your income or pay for any unexpected expenses without going into debt. At the very minimum, you should have 3 months of expenses saved. That will give you time to find a new job if you get laid off suddenly and struggle to find a new job. \n\nNow I don't know what you get paid, but in the UK, \u00a32k is likely to be around a month of your pay (maybe a little more or less). \n\nThis means that if you lost your job tomorrow or something happens where you can't work for a period of time (injury, care duties, family loss, etc.) you only have a month until you run out of money.

OLED TVs are the \"new thing\", and yes, they're very good, but they're also the most expensive now than they'll ever be. If you really need/want a new TV, you're better off spending 300 pounds on a nice LED TV and waiting until after you buy the house to upgrade to an OLED when the price drops in the future. You have said in other comments that the TV you want isn't the most expensive out there, and that's true, but not by much. You are really reaching for one of the most expensive options. Is it really that important that you have one of the best/newest TVs on the market? \n2. You and your girlfriend really need to discuss communication. You do not seem to be on the same page about finances and your future and that's super important when you're talking about buying a house together. Plus, you need to learn to respect each other when you have disagreements. Her saying \"absolutely not\" when you told her you wanted to buy a TV was extremely disrespectful. Even if she has very valid reasons for not wanting you to spend that much money on entertainment right now, her response was inappropriate in my mind. \"I don't feel comfortable with that\" \"I think that's way too much money to spend on a TV\" \"I'm worried about how much money we'll have for the future\", etc. Lots of ways to get her point across without trying to \"put her foot down\".

She's probably wondering when and if you are actually going to start saving for it since right now she's 25, you are 27, you live together, and don't seem to be putting any money toward a future together. To her, you are making a TV your priority, and saying \"ehhh, I'll get to saving for our future later\".\n\n\nI think you need to ask yourself what exactly is your time line for your future with your girlfriend because given your argument, I'm pretty sure they don't align.

Otherwise, it means the individual is punished for saving their spending money to purchase larger items they want. Even if I got $5/week personal spending , if I kept saving until I had $2000, that money wouldn\u2019t suddenly become joint money. It would still be personal spending. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d consider it a \u201cbigger purchase\u201d in the same way I would some other shared $2000 purchase. It\u2019s obviously a lot of money, but if it came strictly from the other person\u2019s allotted spending (I do think the partners in op need to split out their spending money and savings money), it\u2019s not a discussion amount of money. They can\u2019t be dinged for being frugal over time with their spending by me suddenly being able to veto purchases I wasn\u2019t able to veto before, specifically because they\u2019re good at saving. \n\nNow, Hanging it in a shared living space (rather than an office or other personal space) would be a different story; that needs to be a joint decision.

One cannot force it on the household. \n\nHowever; I also don\u2019t think one partner can object based only on the fact they didn\u2019t want the other to purchase the item. For instance, if the other partner wanted a tv that better suited the room aesthetics, was larger or smaller, had a different screen type; those are legitimate reasons to object.

At $2k you\u2019re paying for name and only slightly noticeable benefits.", "Expecting an adult to make adult choices isn\u2019t controlling \ud83e\udd23", "They don't share finances at this point. She has no right to tell him how to spend his money. He wants something that he will keep long-term and is a one-time splurge. Everyone is allowed to do this. Plus, how far in the future is this marriage and house? If they haven't mixed finances yet, it doesn't seem like it's soon. She has no right to issue orders about his money. They can discuss it but she's acting like she has the final say. NTA", "LOL!", "Yup. It matters to him, and it sounds like he\u2019s thought about it and not making an impulse purchase.", "Yeah. He clearly researched the exact thing he wanted. \n\nThey aren't married. They don't have a shared account. If he's planning to contribute equally to their future goals, why can't he also treat himself with his own money? If he was a girl, we'd tell her that it's a red flag for her partner to dictate how she spends her own money.", "Whether she wants to see responsibility in finances, she crossed the line by telling him \u201cabsolutely not\u201d. That\u2019s not how you communicate about finances in a healthy way.", "NTA. Your gf sounds extremely controlling.", "NAH because she has a good point, but is your money. But don't get the tv  my friendddddd. At least, not until you have a decent amount saved, for an emergency.\n\nOr, try to hunt for a good discount.", "NAH, but it sounds like you two need to talk about finances before your relationship advances.", "Just throwing this out there. Is it possible that your girlfriend is hoping for a proposal? Is girls are great at imagining entire situations in our head and then getting our feelings hurt when that idea doesn\u2019t align with reality. In her mind your savings was for \u201cy\u2019all\u201d whether a ring or a house or something along those lines. Her emotional and obstinate reaction suggests that this conversation is about more than a TV. Reassure her that you are putting as much thought and effort into y\u2019all\u2019s future as you are the tv.", "NTA, I would tell her to get stuffed. Your money your choice.", "So your advice is to let me gf control my money and dictate what it gets spent on?", "Except as I've repeatedly stated by the time we are ready to buy a house I will have my half of the down payment. How is it childish to want to buy myself something nice with money I've earned?", "It's the one big purchase I want to make it's hardly a regular occurrence", "No we have agreed marriage is at least 5-7 years away because it isn't a massive priority for us currently", "NAH to the issue, but if you\u2019ve only got that much in savings at age 27 you can\u2019t afford a $2k luxury like a tv. I recommend you check out r/personalfinance.", "It works the same in the UK. OP isn\u2019t accounting for solicitors fees, surveys, conveyancing, mortgage valuation, removals; this will add up to more than that tv.\n\nOPs deposit figure is low even without taking that into account, it\u2019ll buy literally nothing in most places. If he goes through with that stupid overpriced tv purchase, he doesn\u2019t actually want to move at all. No wonder his girlfriend is pissed, she\u2019s the only one planning for their future.", "This is what I was thinking! My SO and I have been married to other people, never again. We have been living in sin for almost five years now and neither of us would ever tell the other what to do with money. This is insane to me. NTA.", "Exactly. I am all for discussing things through when it comes to big purchases (if there is any fear of debt), but I would never accept my boyfriend just telling me \"absolutely not\" when I tell him I will be spending my own hard-earned money on something that I really want and that we could both enjoy. It has to be a two-way discussion.  \n\n\nIf the price is high, you can always look for deals etc, but flat out telling someone what they can or can't do with their money is not OK.", "At the end of the day you\u2019re still going to be watching the same old tv shows that\u2019ll look broadly the same. You\u2019ll stop noticing the difference in days. What\u2019s the point when you can a perfectly functioning up to date tv for a third of the price?", "Yeah I recoiled when I read the \u201cabsolutely not\u201d part. Wow. He wasn\u2019t asking, he was telling her what he wanted to do. With HIS money. NTA", "It's 7 months of savings for him.", "Wtf? Hell no. My husband buys his stuff and I buy mine, even though we\u2019re planning to buy a new house. Sometimes we buy together or for each other, but we don\u2019t need approval to use our own money. Mortgage and monthly bills are covered by both, then it doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s absurd to think every purchase over x amount should be agreed on.", "The household savings aren't at risk. Yeah we make decisions together but as long as our shared expenses are paid and we both have the agreed money when it comes to buying a hose etc then I wouldn't tell her how to spend her money so why should it be any different for her?", "\"Just look.. the blacks are so much better! Turn on Love Island, won't you?\"", "If this was a guy saying his girlfriend was liquidating 75% of her life savings to buy, idk jewelry or something, they'd tell him to separate finances and not get her pregnant.", "It's not.\n\nYou don't live in the UK, believe me , it is not", "There is one thing I do not see in your reasoning: what if you get ill and can\u2019t do your job anymore? Or end up in a car accident? I\n\n\u2019ve worked at the collections department of a bank in the past and the amount of young couples who had enough money to buy this and that and they would be able to save more for that .... who ended up having to sell everything they had because of one accident or one partner getting ill was very, very high. And I live in Europe, so none of the American Healthcare Costs things over here.", "It wasn't the moment I started putting money away at all. I could purchase the tv now and still have money in savings so buying it near the end of the year will mean I wont be near \u00a30 at all once I've bought it", "What if she wanted to buy a decent bag once?", "Not to mention that once OP buys a place, they suddenly have a ton of expenses on their own shoulders as well. It\u2019s not just the price of the down payment that OP has to save for.", "I do know that my pay will increase at the rate I expect", "The difference in prices in my area now compared to 3 years ago is negligible"]}
