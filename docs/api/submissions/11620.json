Her response was just \"absolutely not\". I asked her what she meant and she said I'm not spending that much on a tv. I told her it was my savings and it's not like I was asking her to contribute. She said we'll be looking for a house deposit in the future and doesn't want me spending all of my savings on one thing.

Maybe this TV has scores of features that his budget 4K TV doesn\u2019t.    4K isn\u2019t 4K. Panel type, screen type, manufacturer, chip set, all factor into the quality of a TV. Just because it says it\u2019s 4K doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s going to be an equal display.  I can with certainty tell you the TV op wants is going to blow that persons $800 tv out of the water in picture quality.", "One study\u2019s average. They even say some are as low as $0. The average is heavily skewed by people getting screwed by their employers, but our premium healthcare is often better than NHS and our hospitals where I live are the best in the world.", "Yeah I'd be fine keeping it for 10 years as long as it still performs well", "And I would. I'd have more than \u00a37.5k saved up in 3 years. By the time we actually find and buy a house it'll be more like 4 years anyway", "Unsolicited? The OP is explicitly requesting financial advice.", "She has more in savings because she lived at home a lot longer than I did so did not have any outgoings and had to use a lot of my savings helping family last year otherwise I'd have a lot more saved up now.", "It's not a business but yeah it is true", "But its still HER money, your shared goals have been met. You have bought your house, your monthly payments are being made. Bills are being split. etc etc.\n\nWhy shouldnt she be able to blow all her savings wherever she wants to?", ">as long as I have the money for the down payment and the house (shared goals)\n\nBut her point is that she's \\*already\\* saving with the intention of buying a house and has more in her savings than you. How are you going to have money for the down payment at the same pace as her if you're spending so much now?\n\nIt's your money and she can't tell you what to spend it on ... but she can take this information and make the decision that you don't have the same financial literacy as her, which may make you incompatible as long-term partners.\n\nETA: This means you're not TA, but you're missing the bigger picture about what this says about whether your relationship will last.", "Yes and also your gf should be able to talk with you about her potential financial concerns like you are an equal adult partner, not like a child.", "You are just not getting this. She is clearly invested in your future together and wants to combine finances and, you know, your lives. If you\u2019re not there then you need to tell her so she stops wasting time with someone who isn\u2019t ready to commit when that\u2019s where she is.", "Yup my \u201cbudget\u201d 4K UHD Sony TV is totally a terrible TV.", "Oh so you\u2019re defensive because you\u2019d also buy a $2,000 TV, and everybody here is saying that\u2019s dumb?", "Your girlfriend probably worries that after the tv there will be something else you will want to \"invest\" in. In my experience people who are willing to blow that much for an unnecessarily fancy TV aren't frugal in other ways, but who knows, maybe this is your one luxury.\n\nLook, you can spend your money how you choose, and I do think your girlfriend was wrong to try to veto the purchase, since it doesn't sound as if you two have mixed finances yet. But you need to have a conversation as soon as possible about how much you want to save for a house (the amount you mention sounds very low for a down-payment to me) and how you expect to handle finances.", "Where did op ask how op should be managing their money and how to go about doing it ? \n\n\nOp asked if they were an AH for wanting to buy a new TV using their savings.", "Both fair points. She\u2019s still right about the TV though dawg.", "What if you need to help your family again in the future?", "You can treat yourself, but that doesn\u2019t mean to empty 20% of your savings. Why not treat yourself to a $500 tv?\n\nWill your down deposit drain your savings account? You should have atleast 6 months living expenses saved up on top of your down payment. What happens if you lose your job, the roof leaks, or your car breaks down? You need an emergency fund.\n\nJust because you have the money to buy it doesn\u2019t mean you can \u201cafford\u201d it. Will you still be able to save money each month while paying your mortgage?", "As long as the monthly bills are being paid and any shared goals we have she can still contribute to then she is entitled to spend her savings as she pleases", "I am currently saving more a month than she is so when it comes to looking at houses we will have equal amounts", "Except she didn't try to talk to me about them. Her response was just 'absolutely not' as I said in the post", "Neither of us want to combine finances yet. We agreed we'd only be doing that after marriage", "Didn\u2019t say it was terrible. I\u2019m sure it works, & has a good picture which is good enough for your needs. However what OP is looking at will be better.", "No I\u2019m not.   Mine was a $250 4K budget TV.  \nI\u2019m stating that there is a reason why TV\u2019s are sold at that price.   Just because you or the others don\u2019t see the need doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t there.", "That won't happen. I don't really want to go into details but there's a 0% chance of that happening again", "Yeah loads of people - including your girlfriend by the sounds of it - don't think of it that way. There's no way I'd buy something for \u00a32k without agreement with my husband. There's no my/his money, only our money. We tend to run any purchase over about \u00a33-400 past each other - it's just a communication/openness/respect thing, not an affordability or who earns what thing.", "Yeah, thats what I said. All monthly bills (TILL NOW) are met and paid for. Then she burns through 5 years of her savings on a Vegas weekend. \n\nShe gets laid off the month after and can no longer contribute to paying the bills. And needs to start borrowing money from your savings for her day to day. \n\nWould you be ok with that?", ">I'm saving \u00a3300 a month ... I mentioned it wouldn't be for at least 6-7 months ... I showed her an OLED tv that I was looking at that was \u00a32000.\n\nYou essentially just told her you'll be spending the equivalent of 6-7 months of savings on a TV (maybe a bit less if it's on sale by the time you purchase it but TVs depreciate in value, they aren't an investment). That's a reasonable reason for her to be concerned.", "I mean can you really call that a *need,* though?", "Do you see the difference between your goals and your girlfriends goals though?\n\nShe wants to invest in a home where you can build a future. You want a TV. You're coming across as incredibly immature here.", "Then that becomes a different scenario because as I have stated repeatedly as long as bills and shared goals are paid towards then you should be able to spend your money as you please.", "Where did I say I didn't want a home? I have pointed out we won't even begin looking for homes for another 2-3 years which is enough time for me to save up a deposit as the house prices in our area are lower than average so my down payment is only likely to be around \u00a37.5k"]}
