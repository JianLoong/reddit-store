I pointed out it is likely to be cheaper when I'm actually going to buy it and that depending on how much I have saved, I might just pay monthly or if I can afford it without completely draining my savings then I'd buy it outright. Her response was just \"absolutely not\". I asked her what she meant and she said I'm not spending that much on a tv. I told her it was my savings and it's not like I was asking her to contribute. She said we'll be looking for a house deposit in the future and doesn't want me spending all of my savings on one thing. I reiterated I wouldn't be getting it until towards the end of the year when I'd have a lot more in my savings and I will be getting a pay rise from work in the summer so will be saving more anyway and I want to treat myself.\n\nShe just repeated that I'm not using my savings to get a new tv.

It is an appliance and it can be damaged, broken and lose it's entire value in a single day and warranty doesn't cover everything and you will probably not pay insurance for it. So it is not an \"investment\", it is an expence. \n\nYou are free to use your savings however you wish, however - if you buy expensive tv to use, will you have the same amount of savings as your gf has at the time when you will be putting downpayment on a house? A house is in fact an investment and how much savings you both have together might make huge impact on what type of home you can buy. If you cannot provide the same amount as her, is your gf expected to carry your weight financially?\n\nOverall, I'd think NAH. You are free to spend your savings on short term expensive toys. Your gf is free to reconsider the future of your relationship together if you are putting your own needs ahead of your couple goals.", "NTA - it's your money. \n\n- she's smart.

You cannot afford this TV because if you need to borrow to pay for it, you cannot afford it.

Unless you have in writing signed contracts that says you will receive this pay increase with a stipulation legally stating that it will happen regardless of changes in circumstance, your job and pay is NOT guaranteed.
