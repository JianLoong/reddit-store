By mixed I mean some were men and some were women. Some friends are good friends and some were new to the friend group.\n\nIn the group, a couple of guys and I have known each other since college and have a long standing tradition dating back to those days. Back then, we were degenerate gamblers who made bets on almost anything, including our meals. The way we made our meal bet varied but the point is that the loser had to pay for everyone\u2019s meal. Now that we\u2019re all adults, we no longer gamble but the meal bet remains. The way we do it now is that we pool our credit cards and have the waiter randomly pick a card. Whichever card is picked pays for the bill of all of the other cards. We do this at every meal so it\u2019s not a surprise to anyone. The problem is there was several new additions to the friend group last night who were all women.\n\nWhen it came time to pay the bills, my buddies and I pulled out our cards to play the game. The women who have never seen it asked what we\u2019re doing and we explained our game. Some rolled their eyes and one called us childish. We asked if they want to join and they declined. Then everyone got into the discussion of our tradition and soon even the men who usually don\u2019t participate joined in. The newer women got all of the women to mock us. I want to add, this was all done in jest and everyone was laughing. At the time it didn\u2019t seem like anyone\u2019s feelings were hurt. \n\nOf course I lost so I paid the bills of the ones who played, all of the men. The women each paid their own bills and we left. I went home, went to bed, and thought nothing of it until this morning when I woke up and saw the group text. Apparently some of the newer women were offended by our game and how they thought it was incredibly rude for me to pay some bills and not others. My friends defended me and said their bills could have been paid if they participated in the bet. They countered betting at dinner is rude which makes the entire incident rude. I was perplexed as we\u2019ve been doing this for over a decade and there has never been a problem before. I mentioned it to my colleagues and was surprised at their reaction. \n\nThe men all laughed and said they see no problem with it. The two women agreed that it was rude and I should have paid for the entire group or pay for just myself, not pay for only a select few.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668546510, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw9m55/aita_for_paying_for_the_mens_dinner_and_not/", "score": 875, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is the best I could come up with, though I don\u2019t find it that convincing:\n\nIs it possible the newbs just found the whole game kind of awkward, like it called attention to the table in a way that they felt uncomfortable with?

And some people feel extremely uncomfortable talking about money in mixed company.\n\nAnd then once it\u2019s time for checks, it calls attention to the game and situation all over again? So maybe it\u2019s not that these people were trying to scam a meal, but that the whole thing feels kind of juvenile and kind of ruins the vibe.\n\nBut in that case, why make such a big issue that it has to be a formal group chat the day after?

(Assuming there's no racism/sexism/bullying etc).", "How many male friends have you invited and paid for?", "I do understand your point.  \n\nI think it's rude to have a game like this and not warn someone who is new.  It's a social shock to realize you might be expected to pay for a group's meal and maybe you can't.  I get that they were told they didn't have to play the game, but I still think that initial surprise may have overwritten any other emotion.\n\nI'm also thinking that there is an implied undercurrent since they were already in the group chat that they weren't as \"new\" as I assume from the post.", "All my women friends would think it was fun, and would probably participate\"", "Yeah, I was just using it as an example, and no,  definitely not Russian. It sounds like a fun game and a way to have an interesting eventing. Not sure why all the girls were against it and complained. They should not be invited again.", "But they were invited though. This is like being invited to the lotto pool at work, declining, and then getting mad that you missed out on some cash.", "Many, if I invite you I pay, always. I never assume shit is free. I\u2019m not cheap. I\u2019ve paid many bills before I don\u2019t have a problem paying a bill I have a problem with the fact that he said all the new people were women , why did they consider it rude? Were they on a date?", "What surprise? How is this shocking? It has nothing to do with them. If I went out and this happened, I would either say \"cool I'll join\" or \"not for me.\" Which they did. At no point did it affect them. That's what I mean, the world revolves around them and they are offended by other people doing something that doesn't affect them in any way whatsoever. \n\nAnd if they arent new new, doesn't change the fact they were entitled.", "Woman here, I think it sounds fun and would have participated and I would have mocked the other women mercilessly for thinking their bills should be paid when they didn't put cards in the pot. Ridiculous.", "Agreed for sure, I just think that that is the reason they are mad.", "The \"newcomers\" thing makes me think the ladies were right not to participate. If I'm a long-term friend or more with someone(s), drawing a random card will probably even out over time. If I'm on a fifth date (meet the friends) with someone, well, I could end up paying hundreds of dollars for everyone's meals and never even see the person who brought me to the event again. No problem paying for my own meal, but I would not be joining the \"betting pool.\" \n\nAs to the person bringing me participating, if they could afford a silly bet, then I would just shrug. If they could not afford to cover all that, then that would be a last date. Not because they can't afford to pay the full bill, but because they threw down hoping for a different result when they couldn't afford a loss. Spend your money however you want, unless it's money you don't have. Then I want no part of it, since you're going to keep spending money you don't have."]}
