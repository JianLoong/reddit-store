By mixed I mean some were men and some were women. Some friends are good friends and some were new to the friend group.\n\nIn the group, a couple of guys and I have known each other since college and have a long standing tradition dating back to those days. Back then, we were degenerate gamblers who made bets on almost anything, including our meals. The way we made our meal bet varied but the point is that the loser had to pay for everyone\u2019s meal. Now that we\u2019re all adults, we no longer gamble but the meal bet remains. The way we do it now is that we pool our credit cards and have the waiter randomly pick a card. Whichever card is picked pays for the bill of all of the other cards. We do this at every meal so it\u2019s not a surprise to anyone. The problem is there was several new additions to the friend group last night who were all women.\n\nWhen it came time to pay the bills, my buddies and I pulled out our cards to play the game. The women who have never seen it asked what we\u2019re doing and we explained our game. Some rolled their eyes and one called us childish. We asked if they want to join and they declined. Then everyone got into the discussion of our tradition and soon even the men who usually don\u2019t participate joined in. The newer women got all of the women to mock us. I want to add, this was all done in jest and everyone was laughing. At the time it didn\u2019t seem like anyone\u2019s feelings were hurt. \n\nOf course I lost so I paid the bills of the ones who played, all of the men. The women each paid their own bills and we left. I went home, went to bed, and thought nothing of it until this morning when I woke up and saw the group text. Apparently some of the newer women were offended by our game and how they thought it was incredibly rude for me to pay some bills and not others. My friends defended me and said their bills could have been paid if they participated in the bet. They countered betting at dinner is rude which makes the entire incident rude. I was perplexed as we\u2019ve been doing this for over a decade and there has never been a problem before. I mentioned it to my colleagues and was surprised at their reaction. \n\nThe men all laughed and said they see no problem with it. The two women agreed that it was rude and I should have paid for the entire group or pay for just myself, not pay for only a select few.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1668546510, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw9m55/aita_for_paying_for_the_mens_dinner_and_not/", "score": 134, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is the best I could come up with, though I don\u2019t find it that convincing:\n\nIs it possible the newbs just found the whole game kind of awkward, like it called attention to the table in a way that they felt uncomfortable with? Like maybe this sounds charming until you imagine these guys becoming rowdy frat boys while you\u2019re trying to have a normal adult outing. And some people feel extremely uncomfortable talking about money in mixed company.\n\nAnd then once it\u2019s time for checks, it calls attention to the game and situation all over again? So maybe it\u2019s not that these people were trying to scam a meal, but that the whole thing feels kind of juvenile and kind of ruins the vibe.\n\nBut in that case, why make such a big issue that it has to be a formal group chat the day after? And why be in a group whose dynamics you don\u2019t like?\n\nIt\u2019s baffling!", "I'm not sure if I'd participate or not, but I'd laugh and think it was fun and I certainly wouldn't complain about having to pay for my own meal.", "I wouldn't participate because I probably couldn't afford it but I sure as hell wouldn't be offended!"]}
