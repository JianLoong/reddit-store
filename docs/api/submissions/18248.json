I hope you are in some sort of grief counseling.  Survivor\u2019s guilt is real and can be devastating.", "NTA they are assholes in grief and after the wound isn't so raw they will regret blaming you. It is not your fault, neither their treatment of you or the tragedy that happened.", "NAH - I'm so sorry that you're going through this.  Unless you caused the accident, you are not the reason he died.  Please remember that and try to stop blaming yourself.  Maybe consider a therapist because survivor's guilt is a real thing.\n\nYou went to say goodbye and to pay your last respects.  There is nothing wrong with that.

I would encourage you to give it time .", "I think you did what you thought was best. With good intentions. I am sorry the parents blame you and I hope you don't carry that on in your life. It sounds like you were a good friend as was he.", "NAH. This was fault of the other driver. The blame should not be on you or your friends. Going to the funeral to receive closure is understandable. That being said, grief acts in weird ways and the parents aren\u2019t at fault either. Losing a child is the worse nightmare of any parent.", "NTA, I can\u2019t help but notice that everyone here is mentioning that this is their child and they\u2019ll never forget them. That\u2019s totally fair, but has anyone considered the survivors guilt that OP now has for being in that car and living? \nSurvivors guilt is something survivors suffer with your years if not a lifetime. \nI can\u2019t say the parents are TA because I get that they\u2019re just trying to find someone to blame to help with their grief but you didn\u2019t swerve, you had no ability to prevent any of the events that happened. Im truly sorry that they\u2019re blaming you and am glad you got to say goodbye.", "Info: Personally I think it depends on exactly how he sacrificed himself, you give a pretty vague statement. Is it perceived or intentional? \n\nI could see why his parents wouldn\u2019t want you there, I can also see why you would want to go and don\u2019t blame you for wanting closure.", "NTA.  You didn't cause it.  It was his selfless choice.  Do your best to remember that during the rough moments.", "\n\nNTA. You have every right to grieve your friend's passing and attend his funeral. It's understandable that his parents would be grieving and upset, especially given the circumstances. However, it sounds like you really wanted to honor your friend and his sister was supportive of your decision. It ultimately comes down to you deciding if you wanted to attend and honoring your friend's memory in the way you saw fit.", "NTA dude as long as you didn't murder your friend I do not think in any way you would be the asshole", "The dude literally gave his life so you keep on living, so I'll take the risk of making the assumption the sister is right and it is pretty obvious he would've wanted you to be allowed here, and that if the sister knew, the parents must know it too.  \n\n\nFrom that alone, you're NTA. However it is a very very hard event emotionally for the family, some of them are probably taking that on you because that's the only way they manage to cope with seeing you here, and with the loss. It's undeserved, they shouldn't do it, but in fact they probably are fucked up, literally. So don't judge them too hard either.  \n\n\nI'm deeply sorry for your loss, good luck going foward, live the shiny life your friend died for you to live. Put on the show, who knows, he might be watching it ;)", "NTA/soft NAH and I can't believe people would actually say YTA. you both are dealing with tremendous--if different types--amounts of grief. you were his friend and also in the car. while I don't agree with it, I understand why the parents might blame you and others. it probably feels unfair to them that their son died and everyone else survived--its awful that he did, but from what you imply, the accident was not preventable. anyone could have died. you also deserved a chance to say goodbye, and I am glad his sister thinks so too.", "I don't think anyone is really the A-hole because the loss of a child is so heart-wrenchingly indescribable, at least that's what I imagine of course. Grief can cause any number of behaviors so it's understandable they placed blame on you, even though it seems like a blameless accident. They're not assholes, they're just grieving and don't have clarity or open hearts at the moment. It's a complicated situation, but I'm glad you went anyway and his sister stood up for you. I think it's important that you got to say your final goodbye.", "Gentle ESH...first, I'm so sorry for what you went through. That has to be traumatizing and I hope you are getting help. It doesn't sound like it was at all your fault for your friend's incredible sacrifice. I'm sorry you are being blamed. \n\nBut...quite frankly, you are a friend of the deceased, and that is the parents' CHILD.  Their baby. It is an entirely different kind of grief, and while they may be acting irrationally now blaming you and the others involved in the accident, they are in the depths of an unimaginable grief.  You put your desire to grieve how best suited you over the wishes of the parents of a dead child for who attends their child's funeral.  You were told they likely did not want you there and chose to come anyway, knowing it would likely upset them more while they are experiencing the worst thing a parent can experience. I sincerely hope you are getting help to deal with your trauma and hope you are able to heal going forward.  You are not a bad person for what you did, but yes, I think you should have deferred to the wishes--even the unfair wishes--of the parents in this situation.", "Soft AH. I understand your need for closure, but your need doesn't outweigh a parents need to mourn...And you just ignored that. It was pretty selfish.", "NTA. \n\nI get their anger, but it\u2019s not your fault. I\u2019m sorry this is so crappy.", "Sadly - YTA. You knew his parents didn't want you there, but you went and caused them additional heartache and grief. You and your friends could have, and still can, hold your own memorial service.\n\nWrite his parents an appology letter. Tell them how much you and your friends loved him, cared for him. How you will live your life better to honor him.", "Grief sucks.  Many people can act irrationally.  The parents just lost their child.\n\nHis sister was incredibly gracious and rational.  She sounds like an very wise person.\n\nNTA", "NTA. As a 12 y/o, I was there when my friend 11 m and 2 others were riding on top of an elevator. We thought it was fun. My friend fell and was killed. My parents didn't let me go to the funeral. They thought it would be bad for me. To this day, I regret not being able to say goodbye. You did the right thing. His parents were grieving, and it was the grief that made them say what they did. None of this was your fault.", "Slight YTA, they burried their son. Can't get worse than that, they didn't need the drama on top. And you were told not to go. But yeah i understand your motive and i'm sorry for you and your friends. Don't take their anger personnaly, again they just lose their son so it's not really about you. Plus, the fact to see you \"well and alive\" when their son is gone must be hard, even if it's your not fault.", "I think the priority for emotional well-being should have been for his parents. Whilst you did nothing wrong in attending the funeral, when you knew it would upset them it would have been kinder to put their needs first and do as they asked. If he sacrificed his life for you, then you could have sacrificed your need to be at the funeral for them. I\u2019m sorry for your loss. Live your life for you and him now.

There\u2019s a reason teenagers get into a lot of accidents. It\u2019s that they don\u2019t have the experience older drivers have in how to handle a car when something unexpected happens, and they often overreact and make things worse. Experience matters in driving.\n\nI\u2019m still shaken up over a near accident I had in Miami a couple of years ago. I\u2019m sure if it had been a young driver in the same situation, it would have resulted in a multi car pileup.\n\nI\u2019m so sorry you lost your friend, but don\u2019t feel guilty about anything his parents said. It was totally unfair, and it\u2019s only overwhelming grief that made them say what they did. \n\nAnd I know you\u2019ll likely spend so much time thinking, Why him? Why not me? Why did I get to survive? And you\u2019ll never figure it out. I\u2019ve lived long enough and seen enough tragedy to tell you, sometimes really shitty things happen to people, and we\u2019ll never make sense of it. We\u2019ll never understand. It makes no sense. It\u2019s just a really awful thing that happened.", "You're not the asshole....his parents hopefully will release that....im sorry for ur and theirs loss", "NAH. His parents in their grief are lashing out. It's not right that they are doing this, but I think that they deserve some grace because they aren't in their right minds. When time has passed, hopefully they will reflect and realize they were wrong to blame you and the others and treat you as they did.\n\nYou were not wrong in trying to attend as it was your last chance to say goodbye. I'm sorry that you weren't able to do that. I hope you give yourself some grace as well. Don't ever let anyone make you feel like you are to blame for your friend's death. Your friend died a hero, so the the best way for you and the others he saved to honour him is to live the happiest and fullest lives you possibly can. With that being said, its ok if \"happy\" is/gets hard. This is an extremely difficult and traumatizing moment in your life. You deserve to be here and I'm glad that you are and my condolences for your loss.", "NTA.  You did the right thing.  Had you not attended, they would have said you were disrespectful\u2026that you couldn\u2019t even be bothered to pay your last respects.", "Info: did the crash occur because the group/driver had been drinking, were high or driving dangerously eg speeding? Because if so, I can understand why the parents didn't want you there. If none of you caused the accident eg the other car drove onto your side of the road, then n t a for attending.", "NTA. You are *not* the reason your friend died. He chose to save the people he loved. \n\nI'm so sorry for your loss of such a decent, loving friend. I'm so sorry but grateful your friend for being such a kind person who died too soon. And thanks to the sister who welcomed you and gave you the opportunity to say goodbye. I feel like your friend will be looking over you now.", ">because he chose to end his life saving ours\n\nNTA,  You're not the reason your friend died, he made his choices. Dont get yourself bummed out over it, on the contrary, every day that you are NOT living your best life, is a day you're throwing away what he gave you. Dont let his pissy grieving parents get to you, they werent there, they dont know what happened, and they're just looking for someone else to blame to they can feel better about themselves.", "First of all, I am so sorry for everything you have been through! I hope you have someone to talk to about it all.\n\nNAH. You did nothing wrong. You are grieving and needed to go to the funeral to help with that process. Your friend would have wanted you there.\n\nYour friend's parents are grieving too and sometimes grief can make people act in truly awful ways. Often people look for someone to blame to help them manage the grief. To be clear, I do not think that excuses how they treated you. They were 100% in the wrong. But we can recognize someone was wrong while still being empathetic towards them. Their treatment of you was not about you but the pain they are feeling. I hope someday they will be able to recognize that how they treated you was wrong and will apologize.", "Nta. I think when parents lose a child, (some people say it's the worst thing you can experience) the grief and pain makes them want to find a reason.  They feel like having something to blame gives the situation some logic and a  place to direct their feelings.  But it's just an emotional  reaction. And there is never a logical explanation in these circumstances.   It was an accident, and you were not operating the vehicle. And even if you and your friends were horsing around or something  it's still not your fault.  I'm really sorry for what you are going through.", "You are a little bit AH.  You put your need to say goodbye over the feelings of the grieving parents.  You were explicitly told his parents didn't want you there.", "I am so sorry for the loss of your friend, and I'm sorry too that you feel you have to shoulder the blame - you do not. It was an accident, a tragedy, and I'm sure you are hurting tremendously. \n\nI'm sorry too that you've experienced this hurt further and now feel this burden of guilt after the funeral. I hope you find grace in your heart to be gentle with yourself. What was said came from a place of extreme hurt, but it was still wrong and you did not deserve that especially when you are dealing with a tragedy so new and raw too. I hope you find support and healing in the time to come.", "INFO:  I feel like important details are missing when you just say \"he sacrificed his life so others would live.\"  In an accident situation?  I just feel like that isn't enough info and huge things are being glossed over.", "I'm gonna go with NTA. His parents are grieving and you're a handy outlet for their pain. \n\nI'm sorry you had to live thru such horror.\ud83d\udc9c", "Nta", "NAH. You can\u2019t shout at the universe for being unfair, so you find someone or something you can shout at: the other driver, the other people in the car, the car manufacture for building an \u201cunsafe\u201d vehicle (e.g., \u201cif the car had been built better, it would have withstood a collision better!\u201d) anyone. His parents are not thinking rationally right now, because their grief is so great. I won\u2019t pretend their words didn\u2019t hurt you, but they didn\u2019t mean it.\n\nI am very sorry for your loss.", "NAH. As a parent, I can\u2019t imagine their pain and suffering. I honestly don\u2019t know how any parent recovers from such a thing. I know things like grief and deep sadness make me a less rational and more hostile person. It\u2019s human nature. As someone who has lost people, I understand the need for closure. I don\u2019t feel like there is a clear cut solution to this and I don\u2019t think anyone here deserves to be called an AH. \n\nI also want to say, I survived an accident with a fatality and I\u2019d strongly encourage you to seek professional support. I chose not to and it made recovery much, much harder. Years later I\u2019m only just to the point where I can talk about it with certain people. It\u2019s been a very heavy burden and I\u2019d hate to see it drag a kid down.", "At the end of the day you should have respected their wishes. It was their child's funeral. Mild YTA", "If my parents acted like this toward someone I had *sacrificed my life for*, I would certainly haunt them from the great beyond.", "Tell him goodbye with your heart and thoughts. It isn't the same, but hopefully it will help. Talk to him like he's beside you. \nPeace be with you\ud83d\udc9c", "No he isn't", "He posted that in a comment above", "I can see your point but as grieving parents (and as a parent), I would have shown them that grace to grieve their loss with their loved ones. Especially when their loss is fresh. You needn't go to their space and insist on staying your goodbye. A common place where you both hung out and have memories in would have been an excellent place to say farewell to a beloved friend too.", "Except when the grieving family\u2019s wishes involve grown ass adults blaming a DEATH on an innocent 16-year-old. Let\u2019s not forget that OP isn\u2019t just any kid either, he just survived a traumatic event and lost his friend \u2014 that\u2019s an insane thing for a CHILD to process. Grown adults treating him the way they are is absolutely inappropriate. I know grief does crazy things but the parents are absolutely out of line.", "Being a grieving parent is not an excuse for a grown ass adult to treat an innocent 16-year-old like a monster. I can\u2019t believe I have to explain that.", "You don\u2019t think it\u2019s understandable that parents who\u2019ve lost their child might be acting like AHs? Super weird take", "Family is allowed to choose who is allowed at their child's funeral.", "A car accident where their son was driving? Blaming the passenger? It\u2019s understandable they aren\u2019t thinking clearly but they are being super unfair to OP and it makes absolutely no sense.", "if you deny your child's friend, who you know your child would have wanted there, because of your misplaced grief and anger, then you dishonor your child.", "Of course it\u2019s unfair. I\u2019m just saying that nobody could be thinking clearly in a situation like that. I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019d be able to go on living if one of my kids died. And you expect them to act perfectly? Get outta here", "It's still their choice at the end of the day."]}
