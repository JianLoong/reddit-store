I live apart from my family but in the same city, so I visit every other weekend/whenever my schedule allows. I have babysat my nephew before (usually weekends) \u2013 always in my sister's home.\n\nThe other day, my sister messaged me that she, BIL, and kid were on the way to my apartment. A bit out of the blue, but maybe they're headed somewhere and stopping by to say hi.

My sister overrides me and says our brother is teaching and our (retired) parents specifically requested time off from helping with their grandchild.

After a firm thank you, they leave.\n\nAttempt not to panic failed successfully.\n\nI send my sister several messages re: any alternatives and she replies again that she's really sorry but I'm their best option. It's only 6 hours at most and she'll make it up to me. I text my mom and after a while she replies saying she and my dad \"need a break\" from watching the kid, so they'll be taking the afternoon to catch up on Netflix. I don't text my brother because I know he's in class.\n\nNo permission from sister re: daycare + scared to leave a two-year-old in daycare anyway. So I booked a taxi and went over to my parents' place.\n\nThey were NOT happy when I showed up with nephew but I said I had work, was still sick, and their house is much better equipped for a 2-year-old than my place. My mom sorta made a face and huffed but took my nephew. I went back home to work.\n\nLater in the day my sister sends a barrage of texts scolding me for being \"irresponsible\" with her child and \"inconveniencing\" my parents. For her, I could have \"made the sacrifice\" for \"just a few hours\" and it was an AH move to do what I did. Her husband also sent a text that he was \"disappointed\" with how I handled the situation and \"expected better\" of me. Then my mom sent several texts saying they're angry with me for \"ruining\" their day because they'd specifically said they didn't want to watch my nephew.\n\nTo me, I had enough justification not to babysit my nephew, but my family is labeling me the AH for my actions.

You ignored and violated their boundaries in the same way your sister ignored and violated yours.", "NTA for how you reacted to your sister, and YTA for what you did to your mom.\n\nESH, I guess\n\nThey tried to do you dirty by ambushing you with babysitting.  And what kind of doctor's appointment lasts 6 hours, requires both parents in a way where neither can manage a child? That's suspicious.  Either they were bullshitting you about a doctor's appointment or they are trying to do IVF or something for another kid.  \n\nBut what did you do?  You ambushed your mom!

Your sister and her husband are rude, inconsiderate, and entitled.

(Obviously, you have to trash a day and look after the kid, but only the once after that scare.) They should have scheduled their appointments so that one of them could look after the kid at any one time in the waiting area. You decide to breed, you have obligations. This was not a real emergency, and they disrespected you and your work. NTA. I feel bad for the grandparents, but then it looks like they should have done a better job raising their other child.", "NTA- novel concept. Parents are responsible for their own kids. \nIf you really need a babysitter you arrange one, you don't show up at someone's home and literally dump a toddler on them. \n\nFrom your parents' reaction it looks like your sister treats them like unpaid childcare.", "NTA.

Your parents are tired of being full time unpaid day care and I don't blame them.", "NTA. They just so happened to make several doctors appointments for themselves separately at the same time and magically never realized they'd need a babysitter? \n\nBullshit. I have to schedule my doctor appointments sometimes weeks in advance. They were always planning on dumping the baby on someone.  \n\nAnd really if your mom is so upset she had to emergency babysit her grandson, maybe instead of getting mad at you, she should get mad at your sister for dumping her kid on someone else as soon as they said no. \n\nThe problem is that your sister keeps dumping her kid on people, not that you refused to take him.", "You are NTA. Your sister and BIL are the AHs, the type who think *faaaaaamily* excuses all sorts of boundary-violating behavior. \n\nYou had a valid reason for not watching your nephew, but guess what?

The phrase \u201cThat doesn\u2019t work for me\u201d is vague and impersonal enough to hopefully not start a war with someone who is reasonable. With someone who **isn\u2019t** reasonable, it doesn\u2019t give them a toehold to argue why your reason isn\u2019t valid (to them). \n\nAlternately, just stop answering the phone or door.

You were busy working, next time tell her No and don't answer the door, let them know that is what will happen so they shouldn't even bother trying.  Your sister & BIL need to organise their own childcare outside of just leaving your nephew with family, sounds like they do it to your parents far too often.", "NTA", "NTA. Why do married people feel like it's okay to impose on single people's time, as if we have nothing better to do than to cater to them? An afternoon of Netflix does not trump making a living. It would be different if it had been an actual emergency, and they truly had no other option. But these were scheduled appointments, and they didn't have the decency to ask. Had they asked the day or two before, OP may have had a chance to rearrange their schedule. But they assumed that the singleton working from home at their little job won't mind disrupting their routine. Good on you, OP for not letting them take advantage.", "Nta for you & your parents.

You did the same thing to them as your sister did to you.\n\nI understand that you did not want to babysit, but you have agency when you are in your house. You should have made it clear to your sister that if she left, you would take the child to CPS, or hire a babysitter off of reddit and gave her those two choices as her only options.\n\nYour sister sounds like she takes advantage of people regularly. She needs to understand this cannot happen with you or your parents.  This will not be easy, but if you don't do it, get used to babysitting when you do not want to , or having an uncomfortable relationship with your parents if you ignore their wishes.", "NTA \nKid should never have been dropped on you in the first place.  Apparently, your parents are tired of being the go-to sitter - hence their Netflix day.

You are 100% right in your actions.", "You don't need to apologize to anyone.  This was not an emergency.

OP was sick and needed to work, and the place isn't safe for a two year old child in any case.  Sister and Bil showed up, told her she was babysitting, and walked out and left the kid.

I think OP handled it the best way possible given the circumstances. Taking the kid to the parents wasn't the optimal choice overall, but was the best choice given the shitty situation the sister put them in.

It was an emergency after all, she was working and sick and her place isn't safe for the kid to be there.  Then I'd go NC for a while with asshole sister, and probably with parents as well, for directing their anger toward me instead of asshole sister who created the situation.", "Yeah the parents are to blame here thats what I agree with you. OP needs to communicate more with the family to prevent from happening again", "At that point, OP didn't need to call in advance. They were doing what was in the best interest of the child.

That doesn't make them an AH. that makes them the only person thinking of what was best for the kid.", "But they (and please use correct pronouns) asked if they were wrong to take the nephew to their parents, not if they were wrong to not apologize. Plus, they said here in comments they were going to.\n\nI'm sure in the moment they're was a lot of panic and they were simply trying to deal with things. It's okay to not be 100% skillful in such situations.\n\nThe sister and husband weren't giving them crap for not apologizing to the parents. They gave OP crap for taking the child to them. OP was not in the wrong for doing so. Period.", "I don't think communication is the problem. Not from OP's side, anyway. \n\nThe sister knew that if she asked OP ahead of time, they would have declined to watch the kid. That's why she texted they were \"coming over\" but not why. Already she was planning to ambush OP and hope that overwhelming them would work."]}
