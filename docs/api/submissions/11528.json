I live apart from my family but in the same city, so I visit every other weekend/whenever my schedule allows. I have babysat my nephew before (usually weekends) \u2013 always in my sister's home.\n\nThe other day, my sister messaged me that she, BIL, and kid were on the way to my apartment. A bit out of the blue, but maybe they're headed somewhere and stopping by to say hi. However, when I answered my door, my sister began hurriedly explaining that they need someone to watch the kid while they go to their doctor's appointments and I'm their \"only option.\"\n\nProblems:\n\n\\- I\u2019m self-employed WFH but juggle 3 clients/jobs with time-sensitive deadlines\n\n\\- I have ADHD so I hyperfocus, meaning I might not notice something wrong with my nephew if I'm working\n\n\\- My tiny apartment is not childproof in any way\n\n\\- I'm only just starting to recover from an infection\n\n(My sister knows all of this.)\n\nI try to explain that I can\u2019t watch the kid. My sister overrides me and says our brother is teaching and our (retired) parents specifically requested time off from helping with their grandchild. Sister + BIL really need to get to the hospital so they need me to do this. After a firm thank you, they leave.\n\nAttempt not to panic failed successfully.\n\nI send my sister several messages re: any alternatives and she replies again that she's really sorry but I'm their best option. It's only 6 hours at most and she'll make it up to me. I text my mom and after a while she replies saying she and my dad \"need a break\" from watching the kid, so they'll be taking the afternoon to catch up on Netflix. I don't text my brother because I know he's in class.\n\nNo permission from sister re: daycare + scared to leave a two-year-old in daycare anyway. So I booked a taxi and went over to my parents' place.\n\nThey were NOT happy when I showed up with nephew but I said I had work, was still sick, and their house is much better equipped for a 2-year-old than my place. My mom sorta made a face and huffed but took my nephew. I went back home to work.\n\nLater in the day my sister sends a barrage of texts scolding me for being \"irresponsible\" with her child and \"inconveniencing\" my parents. For her, I could have \"made the sacrifice\" for \"just a few hours\" and it was an AH move to do what I did. Her husband also sent a text that he was \"disappointed\" with how I handled the situation and \"expected better\" of me. Then my mom sent several texts saying they're angry with me for \"ruining\" their day because they'd specifically said they didn't want to watch my nephew.\n\nTo me, I had enough justification not to babysit my nephew, but my family is labeling me the AH for my actions.

You ignored and violated their boundaries in the same way your sister ignored and violated yours.", "NTA for how you reacted to your sister, and YTA for what you did to your mom.\n\nESH, I guess\n\nThey tried to do you dirty by ambushing you with babysitting.  And what kind of doctor's appointment lasts 6 hours, requires both parents in a way where neither can manage a child? That's suspicious.  Either they were bullshitting you about a doctor's appointment or they are trying to do IVF or something for another kid.  \n\nBut what did you do?  You ambushed your mom!

You should not have done the same dirty shit to someone else.", "NTA. You need to be very, very clear that they you're only willing to babysit again  (if ever) if it's prearranged.  Your sister and her husband are rude, inconsiderate, and entitled.  You have nothing to apologize for.", "NTA. \n\nIt is completely irresponsible and entitled for them to just drop off your nephew with you, with no notice and after you tell them you cannot watch him. You were given some crappy lemons, you did your best to make lemonade.", "NTA.

(Obviously, you have to trash a day and look after the kid, but only the once after that scare.) They should have scheduled their appointments so that one of them could look after the kid at any one time in the waiting area. You decide to breed, you have obligations. This was not a real emergency, and they disrespected you and your work. NTA. I feel bad for the grandparents, but then it looks like they should have done a better job raising their other child.", "NTA- novel concept. Parents are responsible for their own kids. \nIf you really need a babysitter you arrange one, you don't show up at someone's home and literally dump a toddler on them. \n\nFrom your parents' reaction it looks like your sister treats them like unpaid childcare.", "NTA.

Over the past two years your sister should either have found a day care center she trusts or at least a reliable woman who needs fifty bucks badly enough to come over to her house and watch tv for those six hours.  Your parents are tired of being full time unpaid day care and I don't blame them.", "NTA. They just so happened to make several doctors appointments for themselves separately at the same time and magically never realized they'd need a babysitter? \n\nBullshit. I have to schedule my doctor appointments sometimes weeks in advance. They were always planning on dumping the baby on someone.  \n\nAnd really if your mom is so upset she had to emergency babysit her grandson, maybe instead of getting mad at you, she should get mad at your sister for dumping her kid on someone else as soon as they said no. \n\nThe problem is that your sister keeps dumping her kid on people, not that you refused to take him.", "You are NTA. Your sister and BIL are the AHs, the type who think *faaaaaamily* excuses all sorts of boundary-violating behavior. \n\nYou had a valid reason for not watching your nephew, but guess what? You don\u2019t *need* a reason other than \u201cI don\u2019t want to \u201c. The phrase \u201cThat doesn\u2019t work for me\u201d is vague and impersonal enough to hopefully not start a war with someone who is reasonable. With someone who **isn\u2019t** reasonable, it doesn\u2019t give them a toehold to argue why your reason isn\u2019t valid (to them). \n\nAlternately, just stop answering the phone or door.

You were busy working, next time tell her No and don't answer the door, let them know that is what will happen so they shouldn't even bother trying.  Your sister & BIL need to organise their own childcare outside of just leaving your nephew with family, sounds like they do it to your parents far too often.", "NTA", "NTA. Why do married people feel like it's okay to impose on single people's time, as if we have nothing better to do than to cater to them? An afternoon of Netflix does not trump making a living. It would be different if it had been an actual emergency, and they truly had no other option. But these were scheduled appointments, and they didn't have the decency to ask. Had they asked the day or two before, OP may have had a chance to rearrange their schedule. But they assumed that the singleton working from home at their little job won't mind disrupting their routine. Good on you, OP for not letting them take advantage.", "Nta for you & your parents.

They had no right to dump their nephew off on you.\n\nYTA to your parents. You did the same thing to them as your sister did to you.\n\nI understand that you did not want to babysit, but you have agency when you are in your house. You should have made it clear to your sister that if she left, you would take the child to CPS, or hire a babysitter off of reddit and gave her those two choices as her only options.\n\nYour sister sounds like she takes advantage of people regularly. She needs to understand this cannot happen with you or your parents.  This will not be easy, but if you don't do it, get used to babysitting when you do not want to , or having an uncomfortable relationship with your parents if you ignore their wishes.", "NTA \nKid should never have been dropped on you in the first place.  Apparently, your parents are tired of being the go-to sitter - hence their Netflix day.  Your sister needs to find better arrangements in the future and quit relying on family for free childcare.  \n\nI would ignore every single text, message, phone call.  You are 100% right in your actions.", "You don't need to apologize to anyone.  This was not an emergency.

Also another harsh but sad consequence of her actions.
