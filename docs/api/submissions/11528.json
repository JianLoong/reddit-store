It's only 6 hours at most and she'll make it up to me. I text my mom and after a while she replies saying she and my dad \"need a break\" from watching the kid, so they'll be taking the afternoon to catch up on Netflix.

My mom sorta made a face and huffed but took my nephew. I went back home to work.\n\nLater in the day my sister sends a barrage of texts scolding me for being \"irresponsible\" with her child and \"inconveniencing\" my parents. For her, I could have \"made the sacrifice\" for \"just a few hours\" and it was an AH move to do what I did. Her husband also sent a text that he was \"disappointed\" with how I handled the situation and \"expected better\" of me. Then my mom sent several texts saying they're angry with me for \"ruining\" their day because they'd specifically said they didn't want to watch my nephew.\n\nTo me, I had enough justification not to babysit my nephew, but my family is labeling me the AH for my actions.

Your sister and her husband are rude, inconsiderate, and entitled.

(Obviously, you have to trash a day and look after the kid, but only the once after that scare.) They should have scheduled their appointments so that one of them could look after the kid at any one time in the waiting area. You decide to breed, you have obligations. This was not a real emergency, and they disrespected you and your work. NTA. I feel bad for the grandparents, but then it looks like they should have done a better job raising their other child.", "NTA- novel concept. Parents are responsible for their own kids. \nIf you really need a babysitter you arrange one, you don't show up at someone's home and literally dump a toddler on them. \n\nFrom your parents' reaction it looks like your sister treats them like unpaid childcare.", "NTA.

Your parents are tired of being full time unpaid day care and I don't blame them.", "NTA. They just so happened to make several doctors appointments for themselves separately at the same time and magically never realized they'd need a babysitter? \n\nBullshit. I have to schedule my doctor appointments sometimes weeks in advance. They were always planning on dumping the baby on someone.  \n\nAnd really if your mom is so upset she had to emergency babysit her grandson, maybe instead of getting mad at you, she should get mad at your sister for dumping her kid on someone else as soon as they said no. \n\nThe problem is that your sister keeps dumping her kid on people, not that you refused to take him.", "You are NTA.

It would be different if it had been an actual emergency, and they truly had no other option. But these were scheduled appointments, and they didn't have the decency to ask. Had they asked the day or two before, OP may have had a chance to rearrange their schedule. But they assumed that the singleton working from home at their little job won't mind disrupting their routine. Good on you, OP for not letting them take advantage.", "Nta for you & your parents.

You did the same thing to them as your sister did to you.\n\nI understand that you did not want to babysit, but you have agency when you are in your house. You should have made it clear to your sister that if she left, you would take the child to CPS, or hire a babysitter off of reddit and gave her those two choices as her only options.\n\nYour sister sounds like she takes advantage of people regularly. She needs to understand this cannot happen with you or your parents.  This will not be easy, but if you don't do it, get used to babysitting when you do not want to , or having an uncomfortable relationship with your parents if you ignore their wishes.", "NTA \nKid should never have been dropped on you in the first place.  Apparently, your parents are tired of being the go-to sitter - hence their Netflix day.

You are 100% right in your actions.", "You don't need to apologize to anyone.  This was not an emergency.

Parents needed a break, probably told her no and assumed that she would be a responsible adult and just get a babysitter like everyone else.  It was a doctor's appointment, which unless it was an absolute emergency, would have given them plenty of time to find a sitter, they just didn't want to because then they'd have to pay a sitter.", "NTA in the least bit, but your sister and BIL are huge AH.", "I think ESH applies here since parents said no and OP left toddler any way oP said no to sister and sister left toddler ant way", "Funny how irresponsible adults end up having kids. I wonder why that is...", "You can\u2019t seriously think that", "Why shouldn\u2019t OP do this next time? \n\nIt\u2019s probably the only way to prevent a next next time.", "The parents desire to \"Watch Netflix\"  \ud83e\udd23  Sis is *really* not taking the hint, is she!", "I disagree. Both parents and OP have the right to say \"I am not going to watch a kid who isn't mine\" for any or no reason at all.\n\nIt is nobody's business what they are doing or why they are not available and no one can say the way one is spending their time is more valid than the other.\n\nThe second OP allowed the sister to leave the child it was their problem, they should not have pushed that onto the parents, they should have been more firm with the sister in saying no. Even if they have to say, \"no one will watch your child here, if you abandon your child I will have to call the authorities\"\n\nIt does sound like the parents are probably sick of being taken advantage of for child care, and them having a mental health break may be just as important as the work OP needs to get done. Plus it sounds like they were setting boundaries, only to have those boundaries walked all over because OP did not set the same boundaries.\n\nThis sounds like an ESH to me. Overwhelmingly the sister, but everyone else a little bit too.", "They, not she.", "Thanks. I usually do pick that up, but this time I missed it.", "This is horrible and why would you risk this when it is your family. My goodness, so harsh!", "anyone who would escalate this one instance to the cops is insane and i would cut you out of my life immediately", "Why shouldn't OP have their sister's child taken away by CPS because they were inconvenienced for a few hours?", "*they", "\\*They", "Sorry I just went back and read that.  I should be more careful.", "Hey friend, just a reminder that op is nom binary so they'd be a sibling, not a sister", "First I\u2019m going to take issue with how you frame this. It\u2019s not just \u201cinconvenience for a few hours.\u201d It\u2019s a deliberate, boundary stomping disregard for OP and OP\u2019s time by \u201cparents\u201d who appear to do their best never to care for their child, and who don\u2019t seem to care about the child\u2019s safety. \n\nSecond, it\u2019s highly unlikely that CPS is going to give more than a warning for a first offense. This warning would be a *good* thing and maybe convince them to get their act together. \n\nUntil they gave an actual cost or consequence for dumping their child with no notice they\u2019re not going to stop it. They\u2019re going to just keep going.", "It's not just being inconvenienced.  OP was sick and their sister knew this.  Leaving a small child with someone who might have a communicable disease is pretty fucked up.  People would definitely consider involving the authorities if someone abandoned a little kid in a covid-positive household, for instance.", "It's not a movie, CPS is not going to take away anyone's kids for that.", "I was thinking the same thing. I work in a hospital and our ER has a lot of people who bring their kids. If one parent is sick, the other parent will come along and watch the kids or whatever. There's no reason why they couldn't have just taken their child along with them unless there's a still a policy in place at that particular hospital that doesn't allow it (which I highly doubt). OP is NTA. Sis needs to get over her \"fear\" of babysitters and have someone on hand in case something happens. \n\nI don't know if this would've warranted a call to the cops for child abandonment, but I do think a firm text to sister and BIL stating they must pick up their child immediately and never do that again is definitely a good idea. \n\nI don't know if sister is really afraid of sitters, or afraid of having to pay someone to look after her kid. I used to babysit and I was more responsible to some of the kids I watched than some of the actual parents were.", "Corrected. Thanks.", "Honestly, if the parents are this burned out about babysitting the nephew, I'm guessing that Sis and BiL have a LOT of 'appointments'.  OP doesn't say anything about either of them being unwell or about 'supporting them in their difficult time', which makes me highly suspicious that their 'doctor's appointments' are nothing of the sort (well, unless it's to pick up and use 'medicinal marijuana').", "In my state CPS wouldn\u2019t even open a case for this. Hell they let two kids die a couple of years ago due to negligence. All it would do is scare the shit out of sister and bil which is the point.", "Take issue all you want. You are extrapolating a lot from this one scenario to make this kid's parents the worst in the world.\n\nSounds like you want them to launch a CPS or police investigation to teach them a lesson, which is an insane overreaction.", "NTA. Weirdly only you can get your day ruined. It were all their problems to deal, not yours. It wasn't an emergency. They knew about it way before. They could have asked you.", "This- NTA", "The only mistake OP made was not saying no firmly from the beginning. Not your kid, your problem. I think it\u2019s appropriate to say that your time helping with childcare is over unless they apologize and make amends.", "I agree. I'd feel differently if OP were 17/18, but they're an adult. Their parents were clear that they weren't an option, I don't think it matters *why* they weren't an option. I don't think OP is anywhere near the AH their sister is, but dumping the kid on the grandparents when the grandparents were clear they wouldn't take them wasn't right and OP absolutely owes them an apology", "Exactly. OP was working. WFH Is still working.", "OP's action was logical and on a pragmatic level I agree with you that it was the most sensible option available - but I do think very strongly that they can only ethically make a decision for themself, not for other people who also aren't the parents and also don't have parental responsibility for the kid.", "What would you have done when you were one work deadline & your parents were 'watching netflix'?", "My sister was on maternity leave for several months, then temporarily allowed to downsize her role so she could work remotely for a bit. Her office offers daycare services so when she returned to full-time work, she'd bring my nephew with her (and she knows the staff really well since she's worked there 8 years). Unfortunately though, office daycare doesn't allow children to be dropped off if their parents won't physically be in the office for the day.", "Maybe she was getting an abortion", "Seriously! I had a neighbor who did that. The boy was 7, and rang my bell saying his mom was spending mother's day away . That was about 9am around 11pm I heard the mom in her house and I called her and asked was she finally home because I was going to wake the kid and walk him over. She asked if he could spend the night since he was sleeping. That was a big hard no. I had work in the morning while all she had to do was take her kid to school and then just sit around til school was out. She didn't work. I don't have kids for a reason; I don't like them , but she just saw me as selfish along with her 9 brothers and sisters.", "Not necessarily, my mom once called me to ask if I had a problem with them watching my kids because I never called to ask them to babysit. Anyways once my mom was going for a vacation and my stepdad was looking forward to a nice weekend by himself and told us both not to come to the house. Obviously we both had sudden emergencies that happened and we had to call him for help. We are a one car household and dad ended up in the emergency room while the car was stuck on a military base. We needed food. I apologized over and over because I knew he just wanted a weekend to himself and I needed him to drive 1 1/2 hours to bring me grocieries so my kid could eat.", "I would have taken the kid to the doctor\u2019s office as well.", "& wait - 2 adults going to one medical appointment. \n\nEven if this was fertility  - male produces sample on premises, hands it off to proper person, then female is inseminated (they don't do it like that anymore do they?) -  throughout the appointment they could have traded the baby to the unoccupied parent.\n\nNot optimal. But if I know my chosen last minute babysitter was actively ill,  that is what I would have done.\n\nBetween covid, RSV and all the Illnesses OP could have had that's a way worse bet.", "Honestly? Freaked out. Blown the sister's phone up, maybe tried to bring the kid to wherever the appointments were. Look, what the sister did was awful and put OP in an impossible position, I'm not at all arguing otherwise.\n\nAgain: OP was put in a crappy situation, and in return put their parents in a crappy situation. Maybe that was genuinely their only choice, I don't know. Either way, I think a quick 'hey mom and dad, I know you said repeatedly you couldn't handle nephew for the day and are burned out from doing so so often, but I didn't know what else to do. I'm sorry for making him your problem instead of mine. Let's discuss a way to make sure he's just sister and BIL's problem in the future' would be appropriate.", "If you worked in an office, would they have come to your job, walked past your boss and handed the kid to you. \n\nI think not. They just don\u2019t take working from home seriously. \n\nYes you need boundaries. If anything like this was ever to happen again you do not let them leave the kid with you. However \u201cfirm\u201d your sister\u2019s \u201cthank you\u201d is, all you need to say is - sorry I can\u2019t. You don\u2019t need to justify it but if you want to say that you\u2019re working, that is sufficient. No more explanation needed. \n\nA no is a no period. No one has the right to be angry with you, you never agreed to doing this and they were rude and just dumped their kid on you. Your parents should be angry with your sister and not you. \n\nDon\u2019t put up with this bs from everyone, you\u2019re in the right and try to relax with that knowledge and not let them get to you.", "Both parents don't need to be there the whole time, though.  I've had one, and my husband drove me to and from, because I couldn't drive afterwards, but if we had a small child, we would have taken the child, husband would have dropped me off, gone off and done something fun with the child whilst he waited (or gone home, depending on distance), then picked me up again.  I didn't need my husband to stick around.", "Look around at the context, it\u2019s not this one instance. \n\nEveryone is sick of the kid being shoved off onto them, and the parents don\u2019t listen when told no, that just drop off and leave. \n\nLike, they *don\u2019t take no for an answer*. Unless OP actually does something this isn\u2019t going to end.", "Well, it\u2019s *possible* they both had appointments.  And *maybe* those appointments were in different buildings so they couldn\u2019t easily switch off who had the baby.\n\nBut I\u2019m giving those people way too much leeway.  The reality is, sometimes you have to cancel appointments.  My mom had eye surgery scheduled for months - and then her brother died.  The funeral was scheduled the same day as her surgery.  Guess who didn\u2019t get eye surgery and had to wait two more months for another appointment?", "Exactly. People don\u2019t understand how working from home is still a job with appts, deadlines, meetings. If OP was working at a business, not from home, they wouldn\u2019t bring their kid there.", "\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5\ud83c\udfc5", "Fair,\n\nIt's pretty much a turd sandwich they are all passing off as quickly as possible.", "It\u2019s time for everyone to set boundaries. Good for OP for not taking their bs.", "A SIX HOUR doctor appointment at that...", "I think you need to reasses your idea of how serious shit can get after the cops get called. OP can say no without police getting involved", "Agreed! I feel bad for the kid, if the sister drags this out much longer the kid is going to pick up on the fact that nobody watching them actually wants to be doing it (understandably!)", "OP did say no. Saying no didn\u2019t work. This conversation would be more productive if you weren\u2019t predicating potential actions on clearly inaccurate and nonsensical notions. \n\nThe cops are wildly unlikely to do anything more than just scare the parents into not being jackasses.", "Absolutely valid, however it\u2019s often police and then paramedics (depending on location to ensure the health and welfare of the child) that will end up placing this on file.", "Yeah I was just joking due to the fact than most firehouses have the abandoned baby thing. Police and CPS would get involved anyway."]}
