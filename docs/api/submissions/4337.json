She is very materialistic and dated men who can afford to buy her expensive things. That being said, she has probably 10 luxury bags and multiple clothing from luxury brands.\n\nWhen she moved out out the house she didn\u2019t take everything with herself and left some of the expensive things in my room still. So about a month ago she comes into my room at 1am and the first thing she is looking for are her luxury pants. She couldn\u2019t find them and accused the whole family of having something to do with it. Not only that but also accused my boyfriend of having something to do with it. This makes no sense to me because I literally have cash laying around my room and my own bags, why would I need her things? She always ends up finding her things afterwards but never apologised for her behaviour.\n\nSo she trashed my entire room just to find her pants in another closet where she \u201chid\u201d it. Now recently a week ago she came over to the house when I was away in vacation and couldn\u2019t find her expensive bag and accused me of having something to do with it again. I\u2019m completely disappointed and frustrated cuz I never touch her things, I\u2019m not that desperate.\n\nShe has completely ruined our relationship and still continues to. She texted today to help her bring some of her things I\u2019ve tried her house and I refused to and now she\u2019s acting sarcastic with me like it\u2019s my fault even though she\u2019s the one who jeopardised our relationship.\n\nTLDR: sister accused me and my entire family, my boyfriend (mostly me as I share the room with her) of stealing her luxury things after she moved out (always ends up finding it somewhere afterwards cuz she misplaced them but never apologises) and now I refuse to help her with any of her belongings. She is now mad and sarcastic saying I\u2019m not a real sister.\n\nUPDATE: my older sister has unfollowed me on her Instagram account \ud83e\udd29 typical for her when things don\u2019t go her way.", "created_utc": 1670579357, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zgstol/aita_that_i_now_refuse_to_transport_my_sisters/", "score": 144, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
