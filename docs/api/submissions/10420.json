Her dad and I split when she was 7 and we have had a verbal parenting agreement that has worked for us! No lawyers, no crazy arguments we haven\u2019t worked through and we truly want the best for our daughter.  My now husband wants me to quit working so I can be home with our baby but I carry the health insurance for our son and my daughter.  With his new job, he is able to cover all of us but said that if he\u2019s covering my daughter, he feels it\u2019s fair to get her tax credit every year.  My ex and I alternate tax years as he pays for her school tuition which isn\u2019t cheap.  Am I the asshole for not wanting to change our parenting plan?

I told him that we have agreed upon the 2-2-3 schedule and he said I didn\u2019t know which he has known\u2026 again 4 years under the same roof. He said that it was more of a comment to see if I\u2019d be willing to allow his input.  He used the words loyalty in discussion with me.

If your ex is already paying school tuition, you'll need to keep providing insurance.  The courts aren't going to let you get all the benefits (tax deduction) without you assuming all of the costs (former paralegal here).  Also, you don't mention how the custody is split?  Do you each have your daughter roughly 50% of the time?  If that's the case, the court will definitely uphold the alternating year deduction plan.  It's the only fair and equitable way to do it.\n\nBesides, it's really not about what your husband wants.  What do you want?", "No, the husband is saying he will list her older daughter under his health insurance. Which would cost a chunk of money. \n\nCurrently, wife and husband have SEPARATE health insurances, through their jobs. Wife has herself and her daughter on hers; husband has himself and probably the new baby on his.\n\nIf wife becomes a stay at home mom, she loses the health insurance plan she gets through her job. Which is the one her older daughter is on. \n\nWife, oldest child, and new baby would ALL be transferred to husband's insurance policy. Which again, would be expensive. AND would be happening at a time when they lose the wife's income and increase their expenses via a vis the new baby.\n\nI can't imagine a court forcing the OP to keep her job to provide health insurance (they literally wouldn't be able to) or cough up the money for a COBRA plan if the daughter can readily be placed on the stepdad's health insurance.\n\nThe main problems are 1) mom and the bio dad should be covering this cost for their child. Their kid, their responsibility. 2) Mom cannot cover this cost if she is unemployed. 3) Stepdad should not be responsible for this cost. It's their kid, they have an agreement in place he is not part of. \n\nStepdad has therefore found a way for Mom to get the money to pay for giving her kid health coverage: she gets to use the tax rebate. The money would be going directly to her kid, and bio dad wouldn't be out extra money (which he would be, if mom couldn't pay for healthcare and stepdad wouldn't)\n\nIt could also be pointed out that if mom is now unemployed and they go back to the courts because her ex decides quibbling over $2-3,000, (which may possibly be *less* than the yearly amount it would cost the husband to add the daughter to his plan, though that will depend on his workplace) is more important than his kid having health insurance, she'd likely wind up getting more child support, and bio dad would be ordered to put his kid on his own insurance, since mom doesn't have the option anymore.\n\nI feel like she needs to come up with the money to pay for her daughter. It's a point of pride. If she can't provide for her own kid and *has* to have her husband do it, she should feel ashamed and embarrassed. That would be like asking someone to pay your child support for you.\n\nIf she can't cover the insurance with savings or by convincing her ex about the tax credit, then I don't think it's fair to dump it on her husband. Maybe she can get a small side hustle to cover the expense, and all of this will go away and be resolved, without having to bother her ex.\n\nShe is equally responsible for paying or providing childcare for her *second* child as well. If she keeps her job to cover her obligations to her first kid, she will be on the hook for splitting daycare costs with her husband. If she quits, she is providing the care, while husband is paying to make that possible.", "They don't all work that way.", "Yes and no. Used to work in the health insurance field. Generally (obviously not all cases, but a majority) a premium for group insurance offered through an employer will have an individual rate, an individual + spouse rate, and then a family rate that covers the individual plus dependent children up to age 26. The family rate doesn\u2019t normally increase at all for additional kids and if it does, it\u2019s not a significant amount (generally around 50 per pay check) when compared to the cost of adding a spouse to your plan (generally multiple hundreds per pay check). \n\nEither way, it\u2019s really irrelevant. OP is already paying for the kids. It\u2019s already coming out of the household earnings for Op and the stepdad. The tax credit is sufficient as it currently is split, so why would that change just because the insurance is coming from the other adult in the house? \n\nPlus biodad also pays tuition, regardless if mom or stepdad is paying health insurance premiums. He pays for stuff for the daughter, he deserves part of the tax credit.", "Wow. Such mental gymnastics to make OP the bad guy. The very first issue to be addressed is whether OP even wants to quit working, regardless of hubby's wishes. Hubby is creating problems where none existed, and you've seemingly bought into them wirh him.", "The their kids, their responsability, stops when the stepfather wants OP to stop her having own income, from which She could be responsible for her daughter. Now, the stepfather is in fact 100% responsible for the expenses OP has regarding her daughter.\n\nHaving Said that, he is only responsible for the expenses that OP has. Her ex h\u00e1s others. S\u00f3, it does not make any sense for the stepfather to hoard the tax rebate, when he is not the only One having expenses.\n\nIf the costs of insurance are s\u00f3 great, it is on him and OP to make calculations to see if her quitting her job is still viable or not. If it is, they need to eat the cost of insurance. If not, they are out of luck and OP needs to continue working.", "My spouse carried my oldest child from another relationship on their insurance. The premium did NOT go up. The premiums were as follows:\n To insure self it costs $ this much\n To insure self and spouse costs $ this much\n To insure self, spouse and dependant children  costs $ this   much.\n\nStep children residing in your home for which you provide care for are included in the dependant children.\n\nSome of my children are over 26 now and are no longer able to be included on my spouses insurance plan, and the premiums did not go down (went from 6 kids to 3 kids).\n\nThe court ordered BOTH myself and my child's father to carry health insurance on the child. This requirement could be met by having our spouses carry the child on the health insurance plan. \n\nThe court also found that because my child's father continued to voluntarily give up working (whole nother story, they were just avoiding paying child support) and become unemployed, that they were still responsible for the measly amount of child support they were required to pay ($80 a month, because they worked a minimum wage job on the books part time, and then worked a real full time job for cash). Depending on the judge, she may not get extra support due to voluntarily becoming unemployed. \n\nThe time, money, and strife that hiring a lawyer and going to court is going to cost OP, it's probably not worth it. She has a healthy coparenting plan with her ex. It works for her, her ex and most importantly, her daughter. OP and her current husband need to sit down and actually look at what the premiums are going to cost. If the premium is like my insurance and does NOT go up for having 2 children vs. 1 child, then OPs husband needs to just add them and be done with it. If it does go up, then and only then, OP should have a discussion with her ex about possibly putting the daughter on the exes insurance or having him chip in for half the premium for his child (not the whole premium, OP is responsible for half and if her husband wants her to be a shm, then he need to pay the other half as he is essentially taking financial responsibility for OP).\n\nHe married her, knowing full well she had a child. The husband has known about the parenting plan for 6 yrs now. Just because he has his \"own\" family now does not mean he should be changing what currently is working for his stepdaughter. \n \n\nEdit: Someone just reminded me that bio dad pays the tuition for the daughter. So I changed my thoughts. Step dad needs to just suck it up if the premium does go up per child. Tuition is not cheap. OP and her husband could get handed a judgment by the courts that says they have to pay half. OP has a pretty good parenting plan in place. Husband needs to suck it up, he's known about it for 6 yrs now.", "You're missing something.\n\n> My ex and I alternate tax years *as he pays for her school tuition which isn\u2019t cheap*.\n\nThis is likely a good deal for OP as the value of the biannual tax credit is likely to be considerably less than the cost of private school tuition. If OP and her husband take the tax credit annually, should they also take on half the private school tuition fees?", "Why would cost YOU?\n\nHe is the one wanting to Change your plan with your ex, and he is the One saying that you should quit your job and lose your independent stream of income, and be dependent on his salary.\n\nThat it is not already clear that he at least will pay half of laywer costs, is a very big warning sign for the financial management and ownership that he intends to make of HIS money when you quit your job.", "Look, he appears to have already an attitude of \"I Will not spend money on your daughter, at least not without compensation\".

Don't think I'd want to be financially dependent on him based on his expectations here.", "Why can't husband be the one to stay home? Why would it have to be you?

They are going to cost your ex, and speaking from experience when your ex is shelling out money for lawyers that were never needed before because of your new husbands demands that are changing his life, his schedule, his finances, and the life/schedule/financial impact to his child, there will be no good will there. Every dollar to a lawyer is one less dollar that can be taking care of your daughter- on both sides. And if this gets volatile, it could mean more than just lawyers. It could mean parenting coordinators and therapists and specific apps for communication and specific meeting places if he doesn\u2019t want to deal with your husband, and you even potentially being on the hook for more than just health insurance. Not to mention there is very little chance a court will give you the sole annual tax credit especially if you\u2019ve always alternated for 13 years. It could also mean your daughter at her age being allowed to choose the home she primarily lives in and you can\u2019t guarantee she is going to choose yours especially if she\u2019s going to have to listen to fights all the time and be made to play the role of bastard older child by your husband.

Not healthy nor mature.

Maybe let him claim the tax refund every year to offset the cost?", "given this has come out of nowhere I see two most likely options:  \n\n\n**1.** he has decided now he has you locked down with a kid, he wants to increase his abusive control of you and slowly become your be all and end all, no job, moving where you don't have family, dependent on him for everything, even your first daughter. this kind of escalation is common in controlling abusers with pregnancy/childbirth. they play the long game so you think wow this guy is awesome and BANG.\n\n**2.** he has fucked something up majorly financially like gambling etc and is hoping to hide it by this tax break, potentially being dodgy about saying you're all on his insurance but then when push comes to shove there are issues etc...\n\nit's not looking good OP. Anyway NTA and do not stop working", "Also I think you should see if your hubby is willing to halfsies for private school! I am guessing that your husband feels like this is the moment he can get you financially dependent on him and then change the lifestyle you have created for your first kiddo. Especially the moving part - how will that affect ex husband\u2019s availability to see his daughter?\n\nThe dependence that your husband now wants you to have on him is very disturbing. It sounds like you have been an even headed woman who has successfully co parented both philosophically and monetarily with your ex. Upending that would be dismal for your daughter - think about changing schools - who pays the private school fees and uproots the child when she is successful. In addition, it will be harder for you to work if you don\u2019t transfer with a job. Keep your independence, keep the coparenting agreement, decide on boundaries with your now husband.", "The fact that they aren't married anymore is not relevant. The Co-parenting decisions are decisions to be made between OP and her ex husband as they are their daughter's parents. The only say the new husband gets for OPs daughter is if both OP and her ex as the parents agree to it. The only child OPs husband has a say in anything in is his own child. \n\nThey already have a system in place that's been in place for years and works for both of them, so there's no need for OPs husband to change it.", "this is about parenting a child that isnt his. The bio dad is still present in the daughter's life, and it should stay like this of course. why should he come last concerning the decision of his own daughter? are you saying the bio dad should also stop paying for the school and everything because they divorced? Or are you saying it would be more enjoyable for the child if her parents started to fight in courts over her?\n\nyou really sound like you dont know what you're talking about... yes your current partner matters, but once you have children, its for life, and you dont just bail on them because you got a new hubby. cancelling the friendly arrangements they managed to keep for 5 years would maybe be beneficial financially for her current partner, but it would bring a battle between her and her daughter's father and make her daughter's life miserable for the next years.", "Red flags right after a baby. I don\u2019t like where this is going. OP, keep your wits about you.", "I honestly can't imagine this shit. If my husband and i were to split and we had a good agreement going for our daughter i would be very pressed and extremely pissed if he then decided that decisions around co-parenting MY child was made by him and his new wife first and I'd basically get informed after the fact?!\n\nNo... never not happening it's not his kid! And the new husband wanting to move is probably gonna be another issue because he does realize she has a daughter right? That she has to see and has to see her father? That's also not something you just do to test loyalty \ud83d\ude44\n\n\nThis is a disaster in the making. And will defs upset her ex because all of this shit directly affects HIS KID!", "He changed now because they have a baby now so he feels like she stuck with him. Then he asks her to quit her job so that she can be more stuck. Standard controlling behaviour.", ">without counting the emotional damage on your daughter when her parents start fighting over her, when it has gone peacefully for many years.\n\nExactly, the co-parenting plan OP and her ex husband have in place has worked well and is still working well without the need of battling shit out in court, there's no need to start any drama and screw up a peaceful system that doesn't need to change.\n\nOP needs to make it clear to her husband that any co-parenting plans between herself and her ex husband is none of his business since its not affecting him in any way and that when it comes to her daughter, only OP and her ex husband *who is the father of their daughter* get the final say.\n\nPlus OP needs to tread very carefully here, with the whole \"I want you to give up your job and be a SAHM\" the \"I want more control/say in your co parenting than your ex husband who's the actual father of your child\" and \"I asked you about moving to see your 'openness' and test your loyalty to me\" is ringing a hell of a lot of alarm bells right now, because it sounds like a future of being isolated from her support system and financially abused (in the least) for OP and if she gave up her job she wouldn't be able to do anything because she won't have the financial means to escape.", "I see lawyer's fees. I see the daughter having to leave her private school when her father decides that mom should start paying \"her share\" out of the tax credit money and can't .I see an epic battle in a few years when it's time for daughter to apply for college and OP has no access to family funds to assist.", "Re your update:\n\nAsk him if he requested a discussion of the parenting plan before he:\n\n-  proposed to you? \n\n- married you? \n\n- moved in with you both?\n\n- got you pregnant?\n\n- had a baby with you? \n\nHe is being ridiculous - either because he\u2019s having new-parenting wobbles (in which case it is not the time for him to be pushing for major changes in the way you do things - he needs to settle down first) or because he\u2019s controlling & (as many other commenters have said) was waiting till you were sufficiently tied to him to start raising the red flags. \n\nIf it\u2019s the first (new parent terror) then he needs to go to individual counselling to sort his head out. During which time you make no major changes to your personal income stream. \n\nIf it\u2019s the second then you need to avoid going to couple\u2019s counselling. It\u2019s a very bad idea with a controlling partner - it gives them better techniques to use on you.", "It really sounds like he wants to isolate his wife from her family. Like why does she need to be willing to drop everyone (and her daughter?) for him?", "Yup.  In my state you have to get court permission to move more than 50 miles away with the child -- and her husband is talking about moving across the country.", "Yeah, I can only imagine the next stage of \"suggestions\" from him, if OP did not bring the subject now.\n\n\"Why not move to another place? It is not like you have a job keeping you here, or if you cannot be a SAHM everywhere....\"", "And he wants them to move away from family...", "Yes but every problem with the ex will affect the kids. Especially a battle indeed. \n\nMy spouse and I have arrangements because of his son. And we don\u2019t always agree with what the mom and stepfather do but they try their hardest and if we all keep in mind we have the best interest of the baby in mind then it will be alright. We are friendly because of the boy and I can\u2019t think of doing things to mess that up, because it will hurt the child and we don\u2019t want that ever.", "I don't think he's doing it FOR the money. I think he's doing it for the control and to hopefully upset things between OP and her ex. He's either threatened by him or he's hoping that by rocking the boat enough OP will give up and send her firstborn to live with the ex and then husband won't have to deal with stepkid at all.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s truly a great thing either way. You\u2019re sacrificing your future stability. It\u2019s a lot of risk and definite lost to your social security and being able to live dignified life in your elderly years (unless you\u2019re very rich to start with)", "Yeah literally not the husband's kid. I'd be very damn offended if with things that pertained to my daughter if my husband and i werent together he decided to talk to his new wife first and then just add me in after! Nah fam. \n\nI'd say let's go to court then i wouldn't want to be a damn extra in my own kids life to accomidate his new wife.", "Agreed, this is moving very fast into \"she's having my baby so now I got her trapped and can start showing my abusive tendencies\" territory. \n\nOP needs to be careful, the whole \"I wanted to suggest moving to you to see your 'openness' about it\" is sounding alarms for me, because it sounds like he's trying to move her away from her support system to try and isolate her..\n\nI know I could be reading too much into it but seeing as these situations are quite common... Plus the whole \"I want more control/say in your parenting plan than the actual father of your daughter\" stuff...", "Just read the update & I definitely agree.. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re reaching at all. This smells like a whole situation to me."]}
