The bigger question is: what do you want? Do you want to stay home? Or do you want to keep your job?\n\nWhatever your decision, it should not effect anything else. You have an agreement that has worked, and should continue to do so. If he wants you to stay home, and you also want that, then he should be alright with accepting the trade offs. Including the loss of your income, and other associated costs.\n\nHe wants to have his cake and extra frosting here, and that's being done at you, and your daughter's potential expense. Perhaps point out how much more expensive a custody fight and lawyers fees could be by upsetting things.", "OP tread lightly because this could blow up in your face if you choose the wrong path without treading carefully.  Before you decide anything, figure out what YOU want to do, not what your husband wants you to do.  From there, if you choose you want to quit working, then discuss the situation with your ex and the dynamics of what's going to change because you're potentially going to involve attorneys and egos.  Again please don't jump the gun because it sounds like everything has been working so far and you want to keep it that way.", "NTA, and the court might very well require you to continue the health insurance anyway\u2014and will likely continue the alternating years of tax claiming. Why fix what isn\u2019t broken?", "NTA your husband is not seeing the big picture. He shouldn\u2019t get tax credit for every year. That\u2019s not right.  If he wants to stay out of court he needs to be fair. His idea is not fair.   So unless he\u2019s prepared to pay for half of her school tuition he  should not rock the boat. Because once you have a step parent getting involved like this it opens up all sorts of other negotiations.", "NTA you have a system that works, the tax credit nothing in comparison to lawyer fees.", "NTA you and your ex are the two who have a say in your parenting plan. You and your husband have a say over the child you share. He's out of line interfering with you co-parenting with the ex.", "Honestly, as someone trying to do without lawyers, I don't blame you. If you have something that works, why change it? You're NTA, but is it possible for your ex to put your daughter on his plan? Also, I just want to make sure--do you want to quit working?", "Info: Would there be a difference in cost if he covered your daughter?  Not sure where you're from or what kind of plan he has, but every family plan I have ever had has the same cost no matter how many kids are on it.", "Chances are, two kids on his insurance would not raise his rates. Most employers have a family option. \nSecondly, paying for her insurance does not equal the bulk of the load for her cost of living which is what IRS bases the credit on. If her father is paying for her tuition, then he also has a financial burden, which would entitle him to a credit every other year.", ">My now husband wants me to quit working so I can be home with our baby\n\nINFO - Do YOU also want that (in the absence of the insurance issue)? Because if not, the whole question is moot.", "NTA But first step, look up the rules for the tax credit.

Your husband only being able to claim your daughter for taxes every other year in exchange for you being a SAHM seems like a fair trade. And like you said - it's not worth the drama.", "NTA- This should have been discussed before you got pregnant though. Sounds a little sudden that \"he\" wants you to quit your job. What do you want?", "So I\u2019m going to switch it up and say NAH. \n\nI\u2019m in a similar situation, i have an almost 3 with my husband and and almost 13 with my ex. We don\u2019t have child support and don\u2019t really pay attention to the court order, we do what works for us. \n\nHowever, things did have to change as the years went on. Our mediator had even told us it would. So we just had to have another conversation. Maybe the ex can put your oldest on his insurance. Maybe he\u2019s cool with a tax credit change. \n\nEither way, you need to have a conversation with your husband to see what works best for you both, and then have a conversation with your ex. \n\nCo parenting is hard, especially when another kiddo comes in. \n\nGood luck!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If that is the case why rock the boat on a good co-parenting situation?", "NTA. Do you want to quit your job?", "Info: why wasnt any of this discussed before you got pregnant?", "NTA. Why is your husband wanting to create conflict where there hasn't been any before? If he needs the tax credit every year to help cover your daughter being on his insurance then maybe you aren't in a position to stay at home? With the cost of daycare I would imagine even having your daughter on his insurance is less costly. You might want to go through expenses with your daughter on his insurance option versus the working with carrying both kids on your insurance and paying daycare option.", "YTA for not having a parenting agreement legally in place. If you did, this wouldn\u2019t be an issue.", "Yesss!! This! I did exactly that and told him how much a lawyer would cost me.", "I like that his cake and extra frosting - that\u2019s a new one for me.", "10000000% agree!! Thanks for your input!!!! Best comment yet!!", "It is possible, I just have always been the person to know I can count on me so I\u2019ve shouldered the majority of the responsibility. He\u2019s capable, I just feel better knowing it\u2019s all taken care of all the time", "I\u2019ll definitely be inquiring about the cost difference! Currently having 1-3 people on my plan didn\u2019t make a difference by I know when you get to 4 it is an issue and my husband and I have the same policy options!! Great point!! Thank you!!", "Came here to say the same. Some plans it\u2019s after three. But others like mine it\u2019s family whether you have one kid or 4.", "I would love to be home, but only if I know that there is no animosity from my husband about my daughter or financial abuse in the future!", "I couldn\u2019t agree more!", "Thank you fiestymouse!! It\u2019s a hard conversation to have but I want the best for everyone!!!", "Actually I consulted 3 family attorneys with him that said if we had a family plan in place that worked why get them involved.  We didn\u2019t leave on worst terms we just grew apart", "I gave 30K dollars to lawyers get the deal you already have with your ex. And you never know what a family court is going to do because they don't give two shits about what you and your ex or your current husband want. That could be better for you or it could be worse. Either way with only 5 years until she is 18 if I were your husband I'd just suck it up and not rock the boat.", "He\u2019s already trying to ruin something that is working perfectly over a measly tax credit for when you hypothetically no longer have your own income, how do you think that\u2019s going to go? Because I see financial animosity of your daughter coming from both her father and your husband.", "I definitely get not wanting to change things that work, but in reality, they\u2019re only now working for two parties instead of three. \n\nIt\u2019ll all be alright. Just gotta communicate.", "Understandable.. but you can still file a plan in pro se or in pro per that gives you legal standing.. seriously there are templates online. My ex wife and I did ours without lawyers and filed it with the courts.\n\nAdditional the tax exemption is very specific.. whomever has 183 nights, and provides care, takes the credit. A legally binding agreement would eliminate this criteria. Tread extremely lightly here as you may run afoul of the IRS, and just get an agreement in place already.", "NTA\n\n\nThe answer is NO.... The tax should be traded off every year to maintain fairness.\n\nHe pays for her tuition. You( and by default now you and your husband) are responsible for her medical insurance. It doesn't matter if it's under your name or husband name...it's still coming from that side of the family. Either he pays for it or you need to stay working and pay for it still. You would be short changing your ex husband by either taking away the tax money he is entitled to or worse..making your ex pay for her insurance on his own. If your husband is so adamant about you staying home.... Then your ex can pay the insurance AND claim your daughter every year from now on... Depending on the costs he could ask for more on top of that.\n\nThere is no point to upset a system that's been in place and has worked for everyone involved ---- your husband is being greedy and frankly the whole \"wanting you to stay at home\" thing is concerning.", "NTA \n\nWhat do you want to do?\n\nAlso, is there a reason your new husband wants you to not work and claim tax credits for your daughter? \n\nHonestly, it\u2019s not his daughter! Is he trying to stir a hornets nest and isolate your kid out of your life a little bit? \n\nBut ultimately it\u2019s about what you want?\n\nAnd what\u2019s best for BOTH your kids", "It all boils down to this..... if it ain't broke.... don't fix it.  Cause you will only fuck it up and complicate it. Why add to your problems.\n\nBesides if he wants you to quit work and he will carry the bills, one of your bills is health insurance for your kids.  He gotta pay. Not your ex. why does the ex's life have to change because you decided to change your financial decisions.", "You've left out really only important information, do you \\*want\\* to be a SAHM?\n\nI'll go NTA, but that's really the only thing that matters.", "NTA.  I seriously doubt any judge would be willing to change that aspect of your parenting plan anyway.  Your household already takes care of the insurance.   You being a SAHM is your choice and is the only thing that has changed between the two parents of your 13 year-old.  I think it would be a MAJOR exercise in futility to try to get this changed.", "This! They likely def will, and they will probably just have you do mediation anyway and try to get you to agree to what you already have", "Oh it was.\nMultiple times. \nNever once did we discuss changing my coparenting plan!", "You? You mean us, if he is even thinking you would agree to his plan.", "It is not only what a lawyer would cost financially, but also what it would cost emotionally. It might set the relationship with your ex back. He would probably not like having to Go to lawyers and the court for something that is working fine at the moment. Also, it might turn into a whole battle which might scar your children. If your husband wants you to stay at home and you want that too then he should not be complaining about extra costs\u2026", "Just made it up \ud83d\ude02", "You're already seeing the control and animosity. Have you tried explaining all this to him? Is he understanding? Sounds controlling", "Ok. What about the other expances for his step kids if you are not working?", "Personally I\u2019d leave the cake and eat the frosting. Yum", "Also like not to throw this out there and think the worst of anyone but, this reeks of potential financial abuse. \n\nWith a new baby in the house, stripping OP of financial independence and a purpose outside the home, coupled with his pushing op to make drastic changes to an agreement that\u2019s working for (future) *money* just puts me off."]}
