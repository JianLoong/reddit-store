Her dad and I split when she was 7 and we have had a verbal parenting agreement that has worked for us! No lawyers, no crazy arguments we haven\u2019t worked through and we truly want the best for our daughter.  My now husband wants me to quit working so I can be home with our baby but I carry the health insurance for our son and my daughter.  With his new job, he is able to cover all of us but said that if he\u2019s covering my daughter, he feels it\u2019s fair to get her tax credit every year.  My ex and I alternate tax years as he pays for her school tuition which isn\u2019t cheap.  Am I the asshole for not wanting to change our parenting plan?

I told him that we have agreed upon the 2-2-3 schedule and he said I didn\u2019t know which he has known\u2026 again 4 years under the same roof. He said that it was more of a comment to see if I\u2019d be willing to allow his input.  He used the words loyalty in discussion with me.

It's important to consider all the factors involved, including financial stability, healthcare, and the needs of your children.

If your ex is already paying school tuition, you'll need to keep providing insurance.  The courts aren't going to let you get all the benefits (tax deduction) without you assuming all of the costs (former paralegal here).  Also, you don't mention how the custody is split?  Do you each have your daughter roughly 50% of the time?  If that's the case, the court will definitely uphold the alternating year deduction plan.  It's the only fair and equitable way to do it.\n\nBesides, it's really not about what your husband wants.  What do you want?", "No, the husband is saying he will list her older daughter under his health insurance. Which would cost a chunk of money. \n\nCurrently, wife and husband have SEPARATE health insurances, through their jobs. Wife has herself and her daughter on hers; husband has himself and probably the new baby on his.\n\nIf wife becomes a stay at home mom, she loses the health insurance plan she gets through her job. Which is the one her older daughter is on. \n\nWife, oldest child, and new baby would ALL be transferred to husband's insurance policy. Which again, would be expensive. AND would be happening at a time when they lose the wife's income and increase their expenses via a vis the new baby.\n\nI can't imagine a court forcing the OP to keep her job to provide health insurance (they literally wouldn't be able to) or cough up the money for a COBRA plan if the daughter can readily be placed on the stepdad's health insurance.\n\nThe main problems are 1) mom and the bio dad should be covering this cost for their child. Their kid, their responsibility. 2) Mom cannot cover this cost if she is unemployed. 3) Stepdad should not be responsible for this cost. It's their kid, they have an agreement in place he is not part of. \n\nStepdad has therefore found a way for Mom to get the money to pay for giving her kid health coverage: she gets to use the tax rebate. The money would be going directly to her kid, and bio dad wouldn't be out extra money (which he would be, if mom couldn't pay for healthcare and stepdad wouldn't)\n\nIt could also be pointed out that if mom is now unemployed and they go back to the courts because her ex decides quibbling over $2-3,000, (which may possibly be *less* than the yearly amount it would cost the husband to add the daughter to his plan, though that will depend on his workplace) is more important than his kid having health insurance, she'd likely wind up getting more child support, and bio dad would be ordered to put his kid on his own insurance, since mom doesn't have the option anymore.\n\nI feel like she needs to come up with the money to pay for her daughter. It's a point of pride. If she can't provide for her own kid and *has* to have her husband do it, she should feel ashamed and embarrassed. That would be like asking someone to pay your child support for you.\n\nIf she can't cover the insurance with savings or by convincing her ex about the tax credit, then I don't think it's fair to dump it on her husband. Maybe she can get a small side hustle to cover the expense, and all of this will go away and be resolved, without having to bother her ex.\n\nShe is equally responsible for paying or providing childcare for her *second* child as well. If she keeps her job to cover her obligations to her first kid, she will be on the hook for splitting daycare costs with her husband. If she quits, she is providing the care, while husband is paying to make that possible.", "They don't all work that way.", "Yes and no. Used to work in the health insurance field. Generally (obviously not all cases, but a majority) a premium for group insurance offered through an employer will have an individual rate, an individual + spouse rate, and then a family rate that covers the individual plus dependent children up to age 26. The family rate doesn\u2019t normally increase at all for additional kids and if it does, it\u2019s not a significant amount (generally around 50 per pay check) when compared to the cost of adding a spouse to your plan (generally multiple hundreds per pay check). \n\nEither way, it\u2019s really irrelevant. OP is already paying for the kids. It\u2019s already coming out of the household earnings for Op and the stepdad. The tax credit is sufficient as it currently is split, so why would that change just because the insurance is coming from the other adult in the house? \n\nPlus biodad also pays tuition, regardless if mom or stepdad is paying health insurance premiums. He pays for stuff for the daughter, he deserves part of the tax credit.", "Wow. Such mental gymnastics to make OP the bad guy. The very first issue to be addressed is whether OP even wants to quit working, regardless of hubby's wishes. Hubby is creating problems where none existed, and you've seemingly bought into them wirh him.", "The their kids, their responsability, stops when the stepfather wants OP to stop her having own income, from which She could be responsible for her daughter. Now, the stepfather is in fact 100% responsible for the expenses OP has regarding her daughter.\n\nHaving Said that, he is only responsible for the expenses that OP has. Her ex h\u00e1s others. S\u00f3, it does not make any sense for the stepfather to hoard the tax rebate, when he is not the only One having expenses.\n\nIf the costs of insurance are s\u00f3 great, it is on him and OP to make calculations to see if her quitting her job is still viable or not. If it is, they need to eat the cost of insurance. If not, they are out of luck and OP needs to continue working.", "My spouse carried my oldest child from another relationship on their insurance. The premium did NOT go up. The premiums were as follows:\n To insure self it costs $ this much\n To insure self and spouse costs $ this much\n To insure self, spouse and dependant children  costs $ this   much.\n\nStep children residing in your home for which you provide care for are included in the dependant children.\n\nSome of my children are over 26 now and are no longer able to be included on my spouses insurance plan, and the premiums did not go down (went from 6 kids to 3 kids).\n\nThe court ordered BOTH myself and my child's father to carry health insurance on the child. This requirement could be met by having our spouses carry the child on the health insurance plan. \n\nThe court also found that because my child's father continued to voluntarily give up working (whole nother story, they were just avoiding paying child support) and become unemployed, that they were still responsible for the measly amount of child support they were required to pay ($80 a month, because they worked a minimum wage job on the books part time, and then worked a real full time job for cash). Depending on the judge, she may not get extra support due to voluntarily becoming unemployed. \n\nThe time, money, and strife that hiring a lawyer and going to court is going to cost OP, it's probably not worth it. She has a healthy coparenting plan with her ex. It works for her, her ex and most importantly, her daughter. OP and her current husband need to sit down and actually look at what the premiums are going to cost. If the premium is like my insurance and does NOT go up for having 2 children vs. 1 child, then OPs husband needs to just add them and be done with it. If it does go up, then and only then, OP should have a discussion with her ex about possibly putting the daughter on the exes insurance or having him chip in for half the premium for his child (not the whole premium, OP is responsible for half and if her husband wants her to be a shm, then he need to pay the other half as he is essentially taking financial responsibility for OP).\n\nHe married her, knowing full well she had a child. The husband has known about the parenting plan for 6 yrs now. Just because he has his \"own\" family now does not mean he should be changing what currently is working for his stepdaughter. \n \n\nEdit: Someone just reminded me that bio dad pays the tuition for the daughter. So I changed my thoughts. Step dad needs to just suck it up if the premium does go up per child. Tuition is not cheap. OP and her husband could get handed a judgment by the courts that says they have to pay half. OP has a pretty good parenting plan in place. Husband needs to suck it up, he's known about it for 6 yrs now.", "You're missing something.\n\n> My ex and I alternate tax years *as he pays for her school tuition which isn\u2019t cheap*.\n\nThis is likely a good deal for OP as the value of the biannual tax credit is likely to be considerably less than the cost of private school tuition. If OP and her husband take the tax credit annually, should they also take on half the private school tuition fees?", "Why would cost YOU?\n\nHe is the one wanting to Change your plan with your ex, and he is the One saying that you should quit your job and lose your independent stream of income, and be dependent on his salary.\n\nThat it is not already clear that he at least will pay half of laywer costs, is a very big warning sign for the financial management and ownership that he intends to make of HIS money when you quit your job.", "Look, he appears to have already an attitude of \"I Will not spend money on your daughter, at least not without compensation\".

Don't think I'd want to be financially dependent on him based on his expectations here.", "Why can't husband be the one to stay home? Why would it have to be you?

If so, you can kiss your relationship with both your ex and your daughter goodbye.  This could get bad fast.", "And he wants her to have no income of her own and be totally reliant on him. This has potential financial abuse written all over it", "The only parties that matter.", "Just to expand the point, and not disagreeing with you. Even if he was not the one gaining the most, this attitude is not very good.\n\nIf they become a single income family, all will (or needs to) become family expenses. Him still acting as if there still are him and her expenses is as not very compelling mindframe to have when asking OP for not having any income of her own.", "Also. Why would he assume that she needed to run the parenting plan by him? It came into OPs life before he did if I read that correctly (PP 5 years: with hubs 4)! If he had a problem with the PP he should have brought it up before getting married. I know it\u2019s the classic line in this sub, but it all points to potential danger", "I think financial abuse...and cutting bio dad out of the picture too. All this drama, with the cover of being \"happy to be fully financially responsible\", but it doesn't smell right to me either. Add in his interest in sniffing out if he can get OP to move...and it just seems like he has a self serving master plan. Bio dad needs to lawyer up if OP entertains any of this.", "Yes! Thank you! I\u2019m getting \u201cnow that I\u2019ve baby trapped you, I can start waving all my red flags around!\u201d vibes from the husband. Maybe I\u2019m just on Reddit too much, but warning bells are ringing in my head."]}
