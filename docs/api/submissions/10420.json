Her dad and I split when she was 7 and we have had a verbal parenting agreement that has worked for us! No lawyers, no crazy arguments we haven\u2019t worked through and we truly want the best for our daughter.  My now husband wants me to quit working so I can be home with our baby but I carry the health insurance for our son and my daughter.  With his new job, he is able to cover all of us but said that if he\u2019s covering my daughter, he feels it\u2019s fair to get her tax credit every year.  My ex and I alternate tax years as he pays for her school tuition which isn\u2019t cheap.  Am I the asshole for not wanting to change our parenting plan?

I told him that we have agreed upon the 2-2-3 schedule and he said I didn\u2019t know which he has known\u2026 again 4 years under the same roof. He said that it was more of a comment to see if I\u2019d be willing to allow his input.  He used the words loyalty in discussion with me.

If your ex is already paying school tuition, you'll need to keep providing insurance.  The courts aren't going to let you get all the benefits (tax deduction) without you assuming all of the costs (former paralegal here).  Also, you don't mention how the custody is split?  Do you each have your daughter roughly 50% of the time?  If that's the case, the court will definitely uphold the alternating year deduction plan.  It's the only fair and equitable way to do it.\n\nBesides, it's really not about what your husband wants.  What do you want?", "No, the husband is saying he will list her older daughter under his health insurance. Which would cost a chunk of money. \n\nCurrently, wife and husband have SEPARATE health insurances, through their jobs. Wife has herself and her daughter on hers; husband has himself and probably the new baby on his.\n\nIf wife becomes a stay at home mom, she loses the health insurance plan she gets through her job. Which is the one her older daughter is on. \n\nWife, oldest child, and new baby would ALL be transferred to husband's insurance policy. Which again, would be expensive. AND would be happening at a time when they lose the wife's income and increase their expenses via a vis the new baby.\n\nI can't imagine a court forcing the OP to keep her job to provide health insurance (they literally wouldn't be able to) or cough up the money for a COBRA plan if the daughter can readily be placed on the stepdad's health insurance.\n\nThe main problems are 1) mom and the bio dad should be covering this cost for their child. Their kid, their responsibility. 2) Mom cannot cover this cost if she is unemployed. 3) Stepdad should not be responsible for this cost. It's their kid, they have an agreement in place he is not part of. \n\nStepdad has therefore found a way for Mom to get the money to pay for giving her kid health coverage: she gets to use the tax rebate. The money would be going directly to her kid, and bio dad wouldn't be out extra money (which he would be, if mom couldn't pay for healthcare and stepdad wouldn't)\n\nIt could also be pointed out that if mom is now unemployed and they go back to the courts because her ex decides quibbling over $2-3,000, (which may possibly be *less* than the yearly amount it would cost the husband to add the daughter to his plan, though that will depend on his workplace) is more important than his kid having health insurance, she'd likely wind up getting more child support, and bio dad would be ordered to put his kid on his own insurance, since mom doesn't have the option anymore.\n\nI feel like she needs to come up with the money to pay for her daughter. It's a point of pride. If she can't provide for her own kid and *has* to have her husband do it, she should feel ashamed and embarrassed. That would be like asking someone to pay your child support for you.\n\nIf she can't cover the insurance with savings or by convincing her ex about the tax credit, then I don't think it's fair to dump it on her husband. Maybe she can get a small side hustle to cover the expense, and all of this will go away and be resolved, without having to bother her ex.\n\nShe is equally responsible for paying or providing childcare for her *second* child as well. If she keeps her job to cover her obligations to her first kid, she will be on the hook for splitting daycare costs with her husband. If she quits, she is providing the care, while husband is paying to make that possible.", "They don't all work that way.", "Yes and no. Used to work in the health insurance field. Generally (obviously not all cases, but a majority) a premium for group insurance offered through an employer will have an individual rate, an individual + spouse rate, and then a family rate that covers the individual plus dependent children up to age 26. The family rate doesn\u2019t normally increase at all for additional kids and if it does, it\u2019s not a significant amount (generally around 50 per pay check) when compared to the cost of adding a spouse to your plan (generally multiple hundreds per pay check). \n\nEither way, it\u2019s really irrelevant. OP is already paying for the kids. It\u2019s already coming out of the household earnings for Op and the stepdad. The tax credit is sufficient as it currently is split, so why would that change just because the insurance is coming from the other adult in the house? \n\nPlus biodad also pays tuition, regardless if mom or stepdad is paying health insurance premiums. He pays for stuff for the daughter, he deserves part of the tax credit.", "Wow. Such mental gymnastics to make OP the bad guy. The very first issue to be addressed is whether OP even wants to quit working, regardless of hubby's wishes. Hubby is creating problems where none existed, and you've seemingly bought into them wirh him.", "The their kids, their responsability, stops when the stepfather wants OP to stop her having own income, from which She could be responsible for her daughter. Now, the stepfather is in fact 100% responsible for the expenses OP has regarding her daughter.\n\nHaving Said that, he is only responsible for the expenses that OP has. Her ex h\u00e1s others. S\u00f3, it does not make any sense for the stepfather to hoard the tax rebate, when he is not the only One having expenses.\n\nIf the costs of insurance are s\u00f3 great, it is on him and OP to make calculations to see if her quitting her job is still viable or not. If it is, they need to eat the cost of insurance. If not, they are out of luck and OP needs to continue working.", "My spouse carried my oldest child from another relationship on their insurance. The premium did NOT go up. The premiums were as follows:\n To insure self it costs $ this much\n To insure self and spouse costs $ this much\n To insure self, spouse and dependant children  costs $ this   much.\n\nStep children residing in your home for which you provide care for are included in the dependant children.\n\nSome of my children are over 26 now and are no longer able to be included on my spouses insurance plan, and the premiums did not go down (went from 6 kids to 3 kids).\n\nThe court ordered BOTH myself and my child's father to carry health insurance on the child. This requirement could be met by having our spouses carry the child on the health insurance plan. \n\nThe court also found that because my child's father continued to voluntarily give up working (whole nother story, they were just avoiding paying child support) and become unemployed, that they were still responsible for the measly amount of child support they were required to pay ($80 a month, because they worked a minimum wage job on the books part time, and then worked a real full time job for cash). Depending on the judge, she may not get extra support due to voluntarily becoming unemployed. \n\nThe time, money, and strife that hiring a lawyer and going to court is going to cost OP, it's probably not worth it. She has a healthy coparenting plan with her ex. It works for her, her ex and most importantly, her daughter. OP and her current husband need to sit down and actually look at what the premiums are going to cost. If the premium is like my insurance and does NOT go up for having 2 children vs. 1 child, then OPs husband needs to just add them and be done with it. If it does go up, then and only then, OP should have a discussion with her ex about possibly putting the daughter on the exes insurance or having him chip in for half the premium for his child (not the whole premium, OP is responsible for half and if her husband wants her to be a shm, then he need to pay the other half as he is essentially taking financial responsibility for OP).\n\nHe married her, knowing full well she had a child. The husband has known about the parenting plan for 6 yrs now. Just because he has his \"own\" family now does not mean he should be changing what currently is working for his stepdaughter. \n \n\nEdit: Someone just reminded me that bio dad pays the tuition for the daughter. So I changed my thoughts. Step dad needs to just suck it up if the premium does go up per child. Tuition is not cheap. OP and her husband could get handed a judgment by the courts that says they have to pay half. OP has a pretty good parenting plan in place. Husband needs to suck it up, he's known about it for 6 yrs now.", "You're missing something.\n\n> My ex and I alternate tax years *as he pays for her school tuition which isn\u2019t cheap*.\n\nThis is likely a good deal for OP as the value of the biannual tax credit is likely to be considerably less than the cost of private school tuition. If OP and her husband take the tax credit annually, should they also take on half the private school tuition fees?", "Why would cost YOU?\n\nHe is the one wanting to Change your plan with your ex, and he is the One saying that you should quit your job and lose your independent stream of income, and be dependent on his salary.\n\nThat it is not already clear that he at least will pay half of laywer costs, is a very big warning sign for the financial management and ownership that he intends to make of HIS money when you quit your job.", "Look, he appears to have already an attitude of \"I Will not spend money on your daughter, at least not without compensation\".

Don't think I'd want to be financially dependent on him based on his expectations here.", "Why can't husband be the one to stay home? Why would it have to be you?

They are going to cost your ex, and speaking from experience when your ex is shelling out money for lawyers that were never needed before because of your new husbands demands that are changing his life, his schedule, his finances, and the life/schedule/financial impact to his child, there will be no good will there. Every dollar to a lawyer is one less dollar that can be taking care of your daughter- on both sides. And if this gets volatile, it could mean more than just lawyers. It could mean parenting coordinators and therapists and specific apps for communication and specific meeting places if he doesn\u2019t want to deal with your husband, and you even potentially being on the hook for more than just health insurance. Not to mention there is very little chance a court will give you the sole annual tax credit especially if you\u2019ve always alternated for 13 years. It could also mean your daughter at her age being allowed to choose the home she primarily lives in and you can\u2019t guarantee she is going to choose yours especially if she\u2019s going to have to listen to fights all the time and be made to play the role of bastard older child by your husband.

Not healthy nor mature.

For example at my workplace AND at my husband's workplace the options are self only/ self+spouse/ self plus children (any number same price)/ \"family\" self+spouse+children)\n\n\\---\"Currently, wife and husband have SEPARATE health insurances, through their jobs. Wife has herself and her daughter on hers; husband has himself and probably the new baby on his.\"  She actually stated in the post that the baby is on her work insurance (since there's no additional charge for multiple children why would they add her to the husband's ins and pay extra???)\n\n\\---\"The main problems are 1) mom and the bio dad should be covering this cost for their child. Their kid, their responsibility. 2) Mom cannot cover this cost if she is unemployed. 3) Stepdad should not be responsible for this cost. It's their kid, they have an agreement in place he is not part of.\"--- If husband is covering the baby he can cover the daughter for no additional cost so moot point.\n\n\\---re \"quibbling over 2-3K  Isn't that EXACTLy what husband is doing, LOL?  So mom is covering insurance but dad is paying the very pricey private school tuition.  If dad hands over the tax credit to wife then wife needs to pick up the cost of the tuition. \n\nNOTHING in OPs original post would indicate she is the one who wants to quit working.  This appears to be husband's \"want\".", "He's already waving that future financial abuse flag. If you give him the power over your finances, you will definitely regret it. Don't be surprised when it ends up coming between you and your daughter.", "I would be worried about financial abuse based on his he\u2019s acting. Especially the talk of loyalty and trying to isolate you from family, etc.", "Did you work while you raised your daughter, cause she turned out great, right? If you quit work, you will never catch up. Is that ok with you?

Divorce is hard enough on kids.\n\n>my husband is now saying that my parenting plan should be between him and I AND THEN we involve my ex.\n\nAs i said in another comment, i am also wondering what makes him think he should come before the literal father of the kid in the decision making. Like, idk what his relationship with your daughter is so far, but since her father sounds to be present both emotionally and financially in her life, it sounds ridiculous he feels entitled to not only a say in the decision making, but the first place in it. I dont want to go as far as saying it raises some red flags, but at the minimum it raises some eyebrows...", "Good for you OP.  You are NTA.  I'd have my guard up if I were you.  It seems like he is trying to consolidate control of both resources and decision making over you and your daughter.  Right now, since you work and pay for the expenses related to her care, you have the ultimate say in things impacting her.  He openly is saying he wants to create a situation where he pays, so he can then say he gets to decide things that are now up to you because he is paying the bills.  Never let a man for whom paying bills =  he makes unilateral decisions about matters impacting the whole household pay your bills.  This guy is not trying to do you any favors or make your life easier by having you stay home and paying for you and your daughters expenses.   He already made the argument for why he should get more power before he even started paying any extra bills.  Thank goodness he let you know so clearly what he has in mind so you can avoid the gold-plated trap.", "I don\u2019t understand.  Putting her under his health plan doesn\u2019t cost him any more in insurance premiums\u2026  if you\u2019re paying for a family plan, it doesn\u2019t matter if you have 3 people (1 kid) or 13 people (11 kids).  What is his reasoning?  This doesn\u2019t make sense!\n\nRather than paying a lawyer, pay a counselor.  You need to get to the bottom of this.

He *says* he doesn\u2019t mind financially supporting your daughter, then he turns around and says he should get the tax credit because he\u2019s paying insurance. He acts as if he is more important than your daughter\u2019s father, when it comes to the parenting plan, and he acts like he knows nothing about it. (It\u2019s been four years. He should know the 2-2-3 schedule by now.) He mentions loyalty *(BIG RED FLAG! He wouldn\u2019t say this if he didn\u2019t feel like you were being \u201cmore loyal\u201d to your ex/daughter than you are to him.)* And he wants to see how open you are to moving away!

Both OP and ex pay things, both should have Access to the rebate. Why is the current partner entitled to all the rebate, if he and OP only pay part of the expenses.\n\nBeing financially responsible for the daughter? If the current partner wants to OP to be a sahm, he needs to be responsible for all her obligations.\n\nMove?

A \"parenting\" plan should be between the \"parents\" -- use your context clues.", "I'm sorry but new husband did not create or raise that child, so no he has no input whatsoever! To bypass the bio dad's much more significant financial contribution for a measly insurance payment is insane!  In what world is that even reasonable? \nAlso him suggesting they move wherever in the US because they can, is OP's husband suggesting they move away from her daughter? \nIn this whole OP, his intentions are not pure and very questionable, if I was OP I would be more firm in putting him in his place, as a step dad...\n\nNTa", "Sounds like he literally said as much to op even!", "EXACTLY.", "Wanted to add that every place I've worked had three types of medical insurance - self only, self and partner, and family. In the family plan it didn't matter how many kids you had they were all covered so he may not even be increasing his costs adding his step daughter to his medical plan.

OP needs to get a clear view of her access to family financial decisions BEFORE leaving her employment.", "And beyond OP's \"openness\", moving away is not a simple process when you share a child with a ex partner. She would likely need to seek a modification of the current parenting plan in order to get the court's permission to move the daughter more than a short distance away from bio dad (at the very least, most states require the custodial parent to provide proper notice of an intent to move, with a statutory amount of time allowed for the non-custodial parent to petition to block the move). \n\nEven if their current arrangement is informal, the bio dad could seek to block the mom moving with the daughter, or force OP to give him full custody if she were to insist on moving away.", "Yeah, do NOT quit your job! He's waving far too many red flags here.", "If they are in the U.S. they would legally have to allow him to carry his step-child on his insurance the same as biological children. \n\nIf they weren't married it would be up to the employer.", "Yup!  \nStay at home parenting only works if the sole income is treated entirely as household income.   \n It doesn't mean that that it all needs to sit a joint account, but both people should have the same amount of  overall control and the same amount of \"mad money\".", "Yeah, I'm not even into labeling things like this but this is just too obvious to miss.", "The moving away is also a big red flag for me. OP mentions that a point of contention is her wanting to be somewhere close to family - which suggests to me that his proposed locations are not close to her support systems. Cut off from her source of income AND her people? I don't like it.", "Can confirm, actually just lost my stepdad\u2019s insurance (yay turning 26) but I had been on it most of my life. Even though like with OP\u2019s situation, my dad was/is actively in my life.", "Yeah, in theory, he wanting to have input if OP and the ex were changing the plan, I think is ok. It would also be ok, in my mind, if he would point out that the plan included some things that could not be viable with a New kid.\n\nHowever, wanting to Change now well-established things, (and that do not affect him) and when nobody else wants to Change it, and especially only bringing them when OP is pregnant and when he wants OP to be financially dependent on him, looks bad as hell."]}
