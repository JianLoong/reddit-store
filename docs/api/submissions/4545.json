But their father didn't want another girl and when I was born, he refused to raise me, so mom divorced him. His parents were involved in my life until they passed and when I questioned if he was really my father, they even did a DNA test on me and my grandparents to help prove it to me. He had shared custody technically of all of us, but only took his time with them. The courts never really did anything about him not taking me but taking them. We grew up with a strained dynamic because of it.\n\nNow our mom is gone and he's sick. They want me to help them since \"he's my dad too\" but he's not. He's biologically related to me but he never raised me, loved me, he even made a point of telling mom in front of me when I was younger that he had his will drawn up so I would get nothing from him when he dies, and he found a way around the backdated child support he owes for me still. He was so smug about it.\n\nI told my siblings I would not help with THEIR father and that he didn't get to cut me off for being a girl and then expect me to care for him as an adult. They said it would be helping them. I said they never treated me as a real sister and were always quick to talk about what he did with them and how amazing he is around me, when they knew how hard it was for me. I said as kids it's one thing but they were like that even as adults. They called me petty. I told them they were expecting too much from someone who was not worthy of any kind of support from the man who was supposed to love and support me as a child. I also said they couldn't decide to suddenly treat me like I'm equal when they have made it clear for years that I'm not.\n\nThey called me an asshole. They called me selfish.

Close the book on that chapter of your life and move on.. they don't deserve you.", "NTA.\n\n> They called me selfish. They told me I wasn't worth shit.\n\nSure, because *that\u2019s* how you convince someone who\u2019s just gotten through complaining that you\u2019ve never treated them like part of the family, much less shown them actual love and compassion that they\u2019re wrong.  Put them all on mute and go about your life.", "They are wrong.\n\nNTA", "NTA - And for all the reasons you stated. HE/THEY didn't love and support you. Why shouldn't you treat them the same as they've treated you? Go NC with them as it seems you are almost there anyway. You deserved better but at least your mom stood up for you and divorced his sorry ass for treating you like that.", "NTA. \n\nYou didn't provide many details about your brothers relationship with you, but even if they were understanding of your dynamic while you were all growing up and didn't flaunt their relationship with your father at that time, it would still be wrong of them to expect you to be put trough this right now.  \n\nBlood conections aren't some magical bond that entitle people to have relationships, if that was the case, your father would have been there for you. \n\nHe had a legal responability as your father, he didn't comply. He had a moral obligation, he didn't care. \n\nYou are doing absolutely nothing wrong. I'm sorry he put you trough this, and I'm sorry your brothers are being selfish aswell. You are definitely not the asshole here.", "NTA.\n\nConsidering he made the effort to disinherit you from his will and be an AH enough to screw your mom out of past child support, doesn't sound like you owe him a damn thing.", "You are not obligated to help or your father.\n\nActually they made it easier for you to permanently block them and move on.", "Nope. You don\u2019t owe your dad and your siblings a DAMN thing! They treated you like nothing and that\u2019s exactly what the Hell they should get from you\u2014NOTHING! They don\u2019t deserve you.

You owe him and your siblings nothing.  I\u2019m sorry they treated you like that.", "NTA I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this. That family is just a bunch of bitter, mean-spirited people who deserve each other. Don\u2019t take care of that man. You aren\u2019t obligated to.", "NTA.\n\nHe refused to care for you. You have no obligation at all to care for him.\n\nTell your sibs to pound sand.", "NTA. They are being The A and the selfish. You only sare DNA with them, Tell them you are gonna spend the same time taking care of him like he spend with you. Its the fair. If they don like It, its their problem.", "Another example of the important distinction between having a child and being a loving parent. I am so sorry for the way your family (bio dad and siblings) treated you. Not your \u201cdad\u201d, not your problem, and NTA.", "NTA. \n\nBut I would ask a lawyer about your dads will and the back childsupport he owes.  Your dads estate would have to pay the childsupport before any other debts, so I dont believe their a loophole for him. \n\nBut you should talk to. Lawyer just incase.", "NTA. Because DNA doesn\u2019t equal parenting. And even if he had parented you, whether to care for him in his old age is a choice you can make, not a legal obligation. And not only that, your siblings are the assholes here in multiple ways.", "NTA- he didn't raise you and actively succeeded in refusing to be a parent or acknowledge you because of your gender... you owe this man absolutely nothing and your siblings are assholes for even trying to make you take care of him. Sounds like they just don't want to have to take on the full responsibility themselves", "NTA.  You don\u2019t owe your father or your siblings one minute of your time.  All the insults they hurled at you perfectly describe your father, sister and brother.\n\nINFO:  Do you have a good relationship with your paternal grandparents?  I suggest you inform them that their son has disinherited you.  Also inform them of the amount of back support that he weaseled out of paying.  Your grandparents can name you as their beneficiary to compensate for their son\u2019s abandonment.  Other Reddit posters have experienced this.  The will has to be written carefully to avoid being overturned in court.", ">They called me an asshole. They called me selfish. They told me I wasn't worth shit.\n\nTell them they're literally proving your point when they say those things.", "NTA\n\nIt consoles me a little to know that you had your mother by your side and that she fought for you and  you have your grandparents.  You owe nothing to your sperm donor and your pseudo siblings.  Better without them in your life.\n\nI hope you have a support network that loves you.", "NTA\nYou owe these people nothing.  Not even an explanation of why you won't support their sick father.\n\nTheir dad emotionally and financially abused you and your mother. You have zero moral or legal obligation to support him in his old age and illness.", ">They told me I wasn't worth shit.\n\nNTA \n\n>They said it would be helping them.\n\nIf they think you're not worth shit why do they deserve your help?", "NTA and that's a hill worth dying on.

Time to fly and be free, we don\u2019t owe even the best of parents anything. We do what we do because of the relationship we have had over our lifetime. Your Dad is getting exactly what he should from you, which is nothing.", "NTA \n\nI just came here to be one more voice telling you that you are so much more, than any of them will ever be.", "NTA But cut contact with them. The reason you are a girl if down to your sperm donor, not your fault at all.", "NTA- I\u2019m also so sorry. You deserved so much more.", "NTA. You know why.", "NTA, enjoy watching the bastard die in need.", "NTA. They sick big time.  I\u2019d go no contact", "NTA cut off all communication with them.", "NTA", "NTA.  What comes around goes around.  Karma really is a bitch.  They just don't want the burden of taking care of bio dad and want to shove it off on you.  He's not your dad - he's a sperm donor and a stranger.  Tell the sibs to go pound sand. You're going to put as much into caring for your dad as he did for you - ZERO.", "NTA and don't let them guilt you.", "If you\u2019re \u201cworthless\u201d in their opinion, it simply means you won\u2019t let them exploit you. \n\nNTA", "Just wow.

He is not your dad, he is a biological donor, and that was HIS choice. \n\nYour siblings calling you selfish just demonstrates they are their father's children, and just don't engage in conversations with them about this, at all. Don't respond to texts, walk away from conversations. \n\nYou don't owe your father a thing, and your siblings are asking too much of you.", "NTA\n\nIgnore the \u2018it\u2019s your father\u2019 nonsense. There\u2019s literally no point in stating his relation to you. You\u2019re not obligated to care for someone because they\u2019re related to you.
