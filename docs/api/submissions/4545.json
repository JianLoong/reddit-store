Don\u2019t go on the internet and give what amount to legal advice without 1) actually being an attorney, and 2) knowing OP\u2019s jurisdiction. There is NO indication of what state OP is in (frankly, we don\u2019t even know if she\u2019s in the US) and family law is one of the big three that ACTUALLY changes from state to state (the others being property, and wills and estates). This comment is useless and what OP should actually do is consult with an attorney, if she wants to pursue recovery from the father (or his estate). Because it actually IS owed to her, not her mom. That\u2019s why it\u2019s a common law principle (but again, not every state) that parents cannot sign away child support. They can fuck themselves over and enter agreements all they want when it comes to divorce proceedings, but when it comes to child support it\u2019s for the welfare of the child (and so that the state doesn\u2019t have to support a kid who should have the monetary support of both parents.) that\u2019s also why state liens exist on childcare.\n\nOh btw, that \u201cstanding\u201d thing is cute, but don\u2019t go throwing it around just because it\u2019s the legal word of the month.

Pretty much anything else is fair game.", "But you're doing the same thing lol. Are you an attorney? I am not... but I'm pretty sure he's right about that. Child support is for one parent to pay another parent that is raising the child for reimbursement of raising the child, not funds for the child to have and use themselves when they are of age. It is for the welfare of the child overall, but it's legally defined as money one parent pays to help with a child's financial needs when the parents don't live together anymore. The parent who the child lives with most of the time is the custodial parent. The other parent is the non-custodial parent. \n\n\"An adult child may be able to sue a non-custodial parent for owed back child support if the adult child is the executor or representative of their custodial parent\u2019s estate. Child support that is in arrears can be either assigned or unassigned. If payments are assigned, they must be paid to the state if the state paid for any of the missing child support payments, such as if the custodial parent is on public assistance because of the lack of support payments. In this case, the state must be repaid before payments are made to the custodial parent.\r  \n\rIf payments are unassigned, child support in arrears must be paid back to the custodial parent, who covered the missing amounts. In this case, the custodial parent can sue the non-custodial parent, or the adult child representing the estate of the custodial parent can sue for back child support.\" \n\nThis is legal advice from an actual attorney. \n\nYou are right it varies state to state and country to country but generally a child can not sue a parent for unpaid child support.", "Good human", "Yes I am an attorney, but no I'm not doing the same thing. I'm pointing out that people need to STFU in this subreddit whenever anything close to a legal situation arises. It's the same as when people say \"this looks like ADHD\" which is such a pointless comment to make off of a snapshot of someone's life. We don't know ANYTHING about what jurisdiction OP is in so saying \"literally impossible\" is asinine, useless, and should be downvoted to hell. At best it takes up space, at worst, it'll make someone who's impressionable or has no knowledge of the situation to think they have no avenues of recovery. Btw, I have no idea who or what you're quoting but again, pointless. Saying things like \"generally blah blah applies here\" is also pointless. There are at least 51 jurisdictions in the US alone, not even taking into account the territories we possess or specialized courts, so unless someone is willing to actually back their claims with credible sources that summarize the legal state of the law in all these jurisdictions, it's incredibly useless. The only legal (and medical) advice people in this subreddit should give is \"consult with an attorney/a doctor.\"", "I mean he said to consult a lawyer and he is right that it varies. I am not from us and here child support is given to the child and it is even a criminal offense to not pay it.\nSo you might be right but you should not give legal advice so confidently."]}
