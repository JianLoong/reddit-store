That\u2019s why it\u2019s a common law principle (but again, not every state) that parents cannot sign away child support. They can fuck themselves over and enter agreements all they want when it comes to divorce proceedings, but when it comes to child support it\u2019s for the welfare of the child (and so that the state doesn\u2019t have to support a kid who should have the monetary support of both parents.) that\u2019s also why state liens exist on childcare.\n\nOh btw, that \u201cstanding\u201d thing is cute, but don\u2019t go throwing it around just because it\u2019s the legal word of the month.

Child support is for one parent to pay another parent that is raising the child for reimbursement of raising the child, not funds for the child to have and use themselves when they are of age. It is for the welfare of the child overall, but it's legally defined as money one parent pays to help with a child's financial needs when the parents don't live together anymore. The parent who the child lives with most of the time is the custodial parent. The other parent is the non-custodial parent. \n\n\"An adult child may be able to sue a non-custodial parent for owed back child support if the adult child is the executor or representative of their custodial parent\u2019s estate. Child support that is in arrears can be either assigned or unassigned. If payments are assigned, they must be paid to the state if the state paid for any of the missing child support payments, such as if the custodial parent is on public assistance because of the lack of support payments. In this case, the state must be repaid before payments are made to the custodial parent.\r  \n\rIf payments are unassigned, child support in arrears must be paid back to the custodial parent, who covered the missing amounts. In this case, the custodial parent can sue the non-custodial parent, or the adult child representing the estate of the custodial parent can sue for back child support.\" \n\nThis is legal advice from an actual attorney. \n\nYou are right it varies state to state and country to country but generally a child can not sue a parent for unpaid child support.", "Good human", "Yes I am an attorney, but no I'm not doing the same thing. I'm pointing out that people need to STFU in this subreddit whenever anything close to a legal situation arises. It's the same as when people say \"this looks like ADHD\" which is such a pointless comment to make off of a snapshot of someone's life. We don't know ANYTHING about what jurisdiction OP is in so saying \"literally impossible\" is asinine, useless, and should be downvoted to hell. At best it takes up space, at worst, it'll make someone who's impressionable or has no knowledge of the situation to think they have no avenues of recovery. Btw, I have no idea who or what you're quoting but again, pointless. Saying things like \"generally blah blah applies here\" is also pointless. There are at least 51 jurisdictions in the US alone, not even taking into account the territories we possess or specialized courts, so unless someone is willing to actually back their claims with credible sources that summarize the legal state of the law in all these jurisdictions, it's incredibly useless.
