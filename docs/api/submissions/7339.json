Check your city\u2019s ordinances and see if there are leash laws and report them next time they leave their property.

This reminds me of the time when I moved into my house and my neighbor had aggressive dogs.  My dog was leashed outside and could not get anywhere near her fence between our yards.  Her dogs would snarl and bark and try to break down the fence, presumably because they wanted to attack my leashed dog.   One night she comes over at like 10pm, drunk, knocks on my door and starts yelling at me saying that my dog caused her dogs to break her fence and she wants me to pay for it AND keep my dog out of MY OWN backyard.  I told her to take her drunk ass off of my property and don\u2019t come back.  And if her one of her dogs does manage to break the fence and comes into my yard, I will call animal control and the police about the aggressive dogs.  She never said anything again, but about a year later one of her dogs broke the fence in the front of the house and attacked a woman and her dog who were walking on the street.  Shortly after, neighbors dogs were quarantined and never seen again.  You should kindly let her know that her dogs are not allowed on your property any longer and if they are found to be, you will call animal control.  NTA.", "ESH.   \n\n\n\"a family member of mine did start to overfeed the dog\" and you got  \"please stop feeding them this shit\" in return. That seems appropriate. Otherwise use your words in negotiating with your neighbors.  \n\n\nWhat volume of food are you leaving outdoors for \"ducks and squirrels and other wildlife\" and why isn't it contained in appropriate feeders?

You made a big mistake not checking that behaviour the very second it started happening. I love my neighbours dogs, and their children, but I don't want them in my yard. Initially, like you, I didnt see it as a big deal when the kids ran through, or stopped to wrestle on the lawn, but then stuff went sideways, things got destroyed and now we're backtracking and trying to keep all of the kids out of the yard. The best thing you could have done is politely approach the neighbours about their dog being in your yard off leash the first time it happened so there was a clear expectation that you don't want the dogs there. Stop giving them treats. They aren't your dogs and you shouldn't be deliberately feeding them. Tell your neighbours they need to find a way to keep both dogs out of your yard. Their presence likely discourages some of your wildlife anyway. Your neighbour is an asshole. Both for not supervising their dogs, and for telling you what food you can leave out on their property. Whether there are dog biscuits in the yard or no, the dogs couldn't eat them if they were kept in their own space or properly supervised.  \n\n\nI wish you much luck with this. I really do.", "That's reasonable. The hanging feeder would be even more entertaining.", "I appreciate your feedback but I gave them dog treats I had that they gave us permission to give them and even offered to pay for treats to give them but since the overfeeding issue the treats stopped which is when the dogs coming over should've stopped too.", "Yeah, that's where the mistake comes in. It's a very nice thing to do, to treat the neighbour dogs, but you basically made your backyard the best place for them to want to be. Now they know they can get treats there sometimes, so they keep coming back to check. And now you and the neighbours both have to work harder to keep the dogs out of your yard (even though it's the neighbours responsibility). Aside from being way too nice and forgiving, I think you're well in the clear here. But that neighbour..ooooooooof. poor you."]}
