They are very unpleasant people.", "NAH.\n\nI think, and you may not like this, that it sounds like like your dad and stepmom have genuinely had kind of an epic romance. Never getting over each other, finding each other again and staying together and still being in love - that's the stuff romances are really and truly made of.   \n\n\nI think that you are thinking that their romance could not have reached the conclusion that it did if your mom had not died. That if your mom had not died, your dad and mom would still be together, that your dad might think of your (now stepmom) sometimes, but he would still be a husband to your mom and you would still be a family. So it is totally understandable that it hurts like hell to think of your dad and stepmom in this grand romance when it feels like your mom died for it.  \n\n\nBut I don't know that that's exactly the case. Think of what your dad said - that your mom \"wouldn't have been happy\" with who he moved on with. That means that there was always some insecurity in that relationship - your mom probably was aware of the fact that he never got over (your stepmom), and that she was the second choice. That stuff will poison a relationship - I think if your mom had lived, they very well might have ended up getting divorced, and your dad and stepmom probably would *still* have ended up back together. So their love is not dependent on your mom dying. That's just how that happened to happen.\n\nI understand your stepmom and stepsister being confused that you still harbor this kind of resentment eight years after you've been living together and being a family together. My suspicion is that if your dad \"doesn't talk very much\" he probably doesn't mention how you feel about this, and she's not aware of all the resentment. So I don't think she was being insensitive in pushing - it was probably genuine confusion.", "I think the purpose they wanted it to serve is validation.

There might come a point where I decide to take them up on that. But I'm trying to make it not a huge deal.\n\nThanks for the support!", "My dad himself admitted my mom would not have liked who he moved on with. And starting back up a relationship at your wife's funeral is not even close to staying single forever.\n\nI'll never actually believed dad loved mom with all his heart when he admits he was never over his now wife. When he admits he always wanted her. That's not loving my mom with his whole heart.\n\nAs for his wife. Well, she showed up at my mom's funeral to get back with my dad.

I told them they were idiots if they thought my most inspiring relationship is one that showed how little my dad cared about my mom, something he said mom would have felt if she knew he went back to the ex he never got over. I told them they are full of themselves to think they mean that much to me that I would shit on my mom. I also told them they were deluded. Deluded to think the woman who showed up at my mom's funeral to get my dad back would be the person I would find inspiring in any way.They're angry that I said what I did to them and I might be a jerk for it.AITA?Also my stepsister is like 19 or 20. My dad and stepmom got married when I was 9, 8ish months after my mom died.\n\nthis 100%. no one said it has to be a POSITIVE model.", "You sure your step sister isn't actually half?", "I\u2019m not your teacher and I don\u2019t know the specifics around why she\u2019s doing this.  However, people spend years trying to understand what they want in an intimate, long term relationship.  Your teacher is giving you the opportunity to look at a successful one and discover what worked for that couple.  How they loved, how they managed conflict, how they grew through the years together.  It is a way for you to think about what you might want for yourself, (and how you would go about getting it) especially if you don\u2019t have an example right in front of you.  Similarly for your classmates who have the same lack of model.  It\u2019s a gift; you are at a age when you\u2018ll begin to have relationships, so it\u2019s good timing.", "Perhaps you can show how good your grandparents relationship is by contrasting it to your stepmother's, since she is so adamant that you include her relationship.", "Wow. Just\u2026wow. Your dad is a complete asshat. He shouldn\u2019t have used your mom like that, and he most certainly never should have said these things to you. No child deserves that type of emotional abuse.\n\nYou are NTA. Best of luck, OP. Update us if you decide to go NC with him after you graduate.", "Austen would have called that mercenary. That's exactly what it is.", "I'm positive.", "Very possibly none, but OP should do so.", "Why not use fictional characters?", "Lmao defending a woman who showed up at a funeral to scoop up a man who\u2019s wife just died \n\nFrom what OP said tho, seems like they deserve each other, two shit people reuniting", "I didn\u2019t want to guilt OP for starting to collect names so I decided to drop a hint", "Your dad is the biggest asshole.", "In that case, he's unlikely to jump in.  Certainly not to try to force you to buy into her fantasy.  \n\nHave you and your dad ever considered some family therapy to discuss this as a family with an outsider?", "No that ahs never been considered. I'm honestly not interested in that even if he was willing."]}
