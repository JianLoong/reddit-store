Not sure what the point of it is but our teacher said it will become relevant in a few weeks. My stepmom and stepsister both assumed I would write about my dad and stepmom's relationship. It was brought up when my stepmom asked how come I hadn't asked her and dad any questions about their relationship yet. I was confused why she was asking that and wasn't putting two and two together right then and she said I should at least ask some questions before doing my paper. This is when it clicked with me and I told her my paper wasn't on them. My stepsister was in the room at the time and asked me why. I asked why I'd write a paper about their marriage instead of my parents marriage. My stepmom said because her and my dad's marriage was the forever one and seeing as my mom is dead and my dad isn't good at talking about stuff it makes more sense to write about them. She said she and my dad would be more inspiring for me anyway. \n\nI asked her if she ever thought I tried not to think about their relationship too hard since she and my dad had a very long history and that as soon as my mom died he ran back to her and married her. Did she ever think that wasn't something I loved but something I struggled with as the son he had with his first wife.\n\nThey were all about \"we're a family, it's okay to admit this is better\" and that kind of thing. I told them I was writing about my grandparents and to leave it alone. They pushed the issue and said it made more sense to \"write about your parents\" and I said it has already been pointed out that I can't since my mom is dead and dad is useless at that stuff. Stepmom said her, that she's my parent. I ignored that and went on about my day.\n\nBut they brought it up again a couple of days after that and said I should want to write about dad and stepmom and I was being weird about it because they will be the primary relationship to model myself after. \n\nI snapped. I told them they were idiots if they thought my most inspiring relationship is one that showed how little my dad cared about my mom, something he said mom would have felt if she knew he went back to the ex he never got over. I told them they are full of themselves to think they mean that much to me that I would shit on my mom. I also told them they were deluded. Deluded to think the woman who showed up at my mom's funeral to get my dad back would be the person I would find inspiring in any way.\n\nThey're angry that I said what I did to them and I might be a jerk for it.\n\nAITA?\n\nAlso my stepsister is like 19 or 20.

Your dad probably loved your mother with all his heart. He most likely suffered just as much as you did when she passed.

They are very unpleasant people.", "NAH.\n\nI think, and you may not like this, that it sounds like like your dad and stepmom have genuinely had kind of an epic romance. Never getting over each other, finding each other again and staying together and still being in love - that's the stuff romances are really and truly made of.   \n\n\nI think that you are thinking that their romance could not have reached the conclusion that it did if your mom had not died. That if your mom had not died, your dad and mom would still be together, that your dad might think of your (now stepmom) sometimes, but he would still be a husband to your mom and you would still be a family. So it is totally understandable that it hurts like hell to think of your dad and stepmom in this grand romance when it feels like your mom died for it.  \n\n\nBut I don't know that that's exactly the case. Think of what your dad said - that your mom \"wouldn't have been happy\" with who he moved on with. That means that there was always some insecurity in that relationship - your mom probably was aware of the fact that he never got over (your stepmom), and that she was the second choice. That stuff will poison a relationship - I think if your mom had lived, they very well might have ended up getting divorced, and your dad and stepmom probably would *still* have ended up back together. So their love is not dependent on your mom dying. That's just how that happened to happen.\n\nI understand your stepmom and stepsister being confused that you still harbor this kind of resentment eight years after you've been living together and being a family together. My suspicion is that if your dad \"doesn't talk very much\" he probably doesn't mention how you feel about this, and she's not aware of all the resentment. So I don't think she was being insensitive in pushing - it was probably genuine confusion.", "I think the purpose they wanted it to serve is validation. For me to see my dad's marriage the way they want me to instead of how I actually see it. Not sure that makes sense or not but it's how I see this.", "My eyes rolled so hard at that. Also made me gag.", "My dad knows about them and I have let them out on him. Since his wife was never married to my mom I try to just stay civil and keep away from her as much as possible.

My grandparents have saved money for me to attend college or to start out in life without it. They're willing to offer me a roof over my head at any time. There might come a point where I decide to take them up on that. But I'm trying to make it not a huge deal.\n\nThanks for the support!", "My dad himself admitted my mom would not have liked who he moved on with. And starting back up a relationship at your wife's funeral is not even close to staying single forever.\n\nI'll never actually believed dad loved mom with all his heart when he admits he was never over his now wife. When he admits he always wanted her. That's not loving my mom with his whole heart.\n\nAs for his wife. Well, she showed up at my mom's funeral to get back with my dad. I would say that is pretty disrespectful at the very least.", "What does your dad have to say about this argument?", "I had to read the paragraph twice just to make sure  I read it correctly \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23.

I\u2019m telling you that is most likely not the case.\n\nShowing up at the funeral. It sounds like she was still in contact with your father beforehand.
