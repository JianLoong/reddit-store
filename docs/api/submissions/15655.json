Your family has figured out something that works for you and that\u2019s great. \n\nAs OP presents it, it sounds like brother just spoils sister and is trying to rope OP into that dynamic. Which she is NTA to nope right out of.", "I've been in your shoes, its hard to see your SO being taken advantage of or treated poorly by their family. If his sister is the golden child you speaking up and calling her out (even if it is to protect your BF) will create family drama and the family will make you out as a monster and may try to drive a wedge between you and your BF or blame you of driving wedge between your BF and his sister. Nothing will change until you BF sees/accepts his sister is a spoiled, golden child. I suggest you take a different route....perhaps start send sister reminders her brother's birthday is coming up, ask her what she's planning. Send her a list of gifts ideas for him, you could say something like \"your brother has been talking about wanting this or I think he would really like this\". When she visits again dont treat her, instead split the bill or ask for different checks.", "I think you're underestimating how often folks don't ever get around to thanking their parents or aunts, uncles, etc for gifts they get in the mail.\n\nIt's thoughtless, but if that behavior isn't reinforced during childhood, they have to learn it", "In her shoes I'd rather pay for my sister's gift myself than split a gift for sil. Not even a thank you??? No way. NTA", "Curious why you wouldn't confront her? I'm dealing with something similar but would like clarification. Like, even just a gentle, \"hey, can i talk to you about how I've been feeling lately?\" Would it be bad? I guess repercussions could always happen, but wouldn't it be better in the long run not to be ignorant of it?", "Pay for the shipping and I'll send you one. I have spares,lol.", "I agree that showing gratitude is a behaviour that has to be learnt in childhood or unfortunately later in life. \n\nThe story doesn't show any indication that thank you's are not common in the boyfriend's family. Yet the sister doesn't show any gratitude for gifts and treats in person, forget about the ones in the mail.\n\nHas she never heard of people saying thank you? She's an adult and a nurse. I'm sure her friends or coworkers have uttered the words 'thank you' to her or others several times in her lifetime.\n\nWhile I still don't believe that she may have never thought of this, I still hope that she learns now.", "I agree, but I'm just sayin', fair's fair.", "I wouldn\u2019t confront till you\u2019re sure your significant other is on your side or the same page. OP\u2019s bf currently doesn\u2019t see the problem. My guess is he\u2019s gonna pick his sisters side and be upset OP is \u201ccreating drama\u201d with his family. Or he\u2019ll pick OP\u2019s side but sister will get upset and get the parents involved. Then he\u2019ll have resentment with OP for again \u201ccreating drama\u201d. Diplomacy is key in family dynamics and truth be told a 25 year old isn\u2019t gonna change so you\u2019d only be getting your annoyance out but not necessarily change anything."]}
