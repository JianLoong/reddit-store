It won't kill her to pull her own weight. Stick to your guns, OP. You can do this!", "NTA \nI don't have time for entitled people who are complete takers.", "He\u2019s so naive and blind.", "NTA.. 25 is enough time for her to have learned manners. Tell bf that he can look after is sisters gift and you will take care of yours.", "Similarly, OP's sister has done more for OP than his sister ever had, why did he suddenly imagine they r the same, jus cuz they r both somebody's sister", "it's surely because it's his \"baby sister\" who can \"do no wrong,\" even though her and gf are the same age.", "An engraved set of Thank you notes so she can\u2019t regift them.", "Me. My family gives physical gifts because we like making eachother happy. We have wishlists because we actually want to get our loved ones something they will enjoy. \n\nCrucify us.", "Lol no we don\u2019t look alike at all! Not even the same ethnicities! \nHe\u2019s a loving partner and does make the extra effort to make sure I feel loved and valued. We have since moved to a different state than Amy. I think he\u2019s just struggling to accept she\u2019s using him after all he\u2019s done for her growing up.", "It\u2019s typical in a relationship that each person handles gifts for their own family. Regardless of her ingratitude, the gifts are his own expense and your family is yours.", "I\u2019m really curious how someone as \u201cbusy\u201d as Amy can take weeks to stay with her brother? Was she working and using your place as a free hotel (probably while collecting a per diem or allowance) or simply visiting?", "Maybe you could start dropping some comments here and there during family gatherings in front of others? Like \"So, Amy what would you be getting Adam for his bday?\" or feign a bit of shock and say \"oh did you know the postage cost is this much between here and there yeah I came to know because Amy charged us for that \" or like \"Amy, I am curious because this is the first time I have seen it, how did you calculate the rate of the time you took to send those docs to Adam\" all in a super sweet voice. Perhaps embarrassing her in front of others would force her to rethink.", "Is this a dynamic they learned from their parents? Was he expected to help out and be kind to her as a big brother while she was allowed to be selfish because she was the baby of the family? Does his dad pamper his mom?", "No one is crucifying anyone. Relax.", "You could tell him your opinion on how his sister and mother treat him as someone who\u2019s observed their behavior over the course of three years.  You don\u2019t have to tell him to limit his contact with them or take any action.  You can tell him he can chose what to do with the information you give him.  He can ignore it if he wants.  But that you had to tell him.  NTA,  of course.", "My grandparents stopped giving the grandkids money (nothing huge, there\u2019s 22 of us, but it\u2019s the thought) and so many wouldn\u2019t even say thank you they stopped", "I would have to disagree. While OP might feel a fleeting sense of euphoria, lowering herself to Amy\u2019s level is truly beneath her. It would also be going nuclear on her relationship with BF.", "Adam had it really rough growing up. His mom emotionally abused him and had him working since he was 15 because he was \u2018the man of the house\u2019. She gave Amy everything (paid for her school, gave her a car, spending money etc) which is why I think she\u2019s so entitled. My boyfriend has a hard time seeing he was taken advantage of and that Amy continues to do so. They were close growing up and he doesn\u2019t resent her for being the favorite, but I think he finds it hard to see who she truly is.\nTheir dad left before Amy was born", "My mil asks for them from us and for our kids for every birthday and Christmas, and this was her request starting early on in our marriage. We give her ideas for the other (ie I send her ideas for my husband + ideas for myself, he sends ideas for me and himself) and then for our three kids. Most often that includes links. I\u2019m pretty sure my much younger sil\u2019s do this too, though so far only one has a partner. No one expects everything off the list, of course; it\u2019s just ideas. And I keep both an Etsy list and an Amazon list for my husband (though I encourage him to try to find the stuff on the Amazon list from other retailers) because I fully acknowledge that I\u2019m ridiculously picky and hard to buy for. My kids are also starting their own lists.", "Yes! I wish there was more talk of yellow flags in any sort of relationship. There\u2019s plenty of stuff that\u2019s less of a warning signal for abusive or controlling people than a red flag, but something to be aware of in case it evolves into a red flag behavior. Something that could just be in asshole territory, or could be a sign of another issue like depression, but that\u2019s not having negative effects on you/your kids/etc. Like\u2026as far as OP\u2019s story goes, I\u2019d say red flags in the same context would be him forcing OP to pay up somehow anyway, going behind her back to steal money or use one of her cards without her knowing, that sort of thing. Having feelings about how his little sister is treated or thought of is pretty normal, and being mad in the moment is fine. He should apologize - maybe he\u2019ll just try to let the whole thing go by not mentioning it again, which is a dick move but in the grand scheme of things, not a red flag - but yeah, the level between \u201cno problems here\u201d and \u201cyou need to leave for your safety/mental health/etc as soon as possible\u201d that tends to get glossed over. All the small stuff that adds up over time even if it never escalates to behaviors that are abusive or are otherwise hurting you  significantly (like\u2026idk, an emotionally checked out spouse who\u2019s dealing with depression poorly, that just feels like a weight dragging you down with them). It\u2019s always \u201cDivorce him now! Don\u2019t take gifts from her, the strings attached aren\u2019t worth it! Quit your job and stay home with your deadbeat partner until they get tired of you being there during their sweet subsidized solo gaming hours! Kill your MIL! Never eat again as penance for eating the party sub!\u201d on posts involving an SO or family in particular.", "Maybe you should respond to that effect next time? It would be interesting to see the reaction...", "You can make Etsy lists?! I don\u2019t know why I never think to check for things on Etsy, since I also try to avoid shopping at Scamazon whenever possible. Wow I apparently need to get my butt over to Etsy and check it out.\n\nI am glad to hear what we\u2019ve been doing seems to sound ok! We don\u2019t have kids yet, so I was worried that we were coming off as childish for making lists for ourselves and each other to send to family. We have two nieces who we love to spoil, so are constantly asking for lists and also buying experiences for grandma and grandpa to have with their grand babies, so I think everyone feels things are reciprocated fairly enough?"]}
