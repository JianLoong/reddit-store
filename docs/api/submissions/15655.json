Someone needs to call her out.", "NTA. Amy is 25 and not 5 years old.", "NTA. Amy sends you a list of things she wants, and never gives gifts in return? Amy can fuck off.", "NTA.\n\nAmy needs to get over herself, and so does your BF.", "NTA it\u2019s his sister he can take care of it. Is he splitting the cost of your sister\u2019s gift as well? Might be time for you to both just take responsibility for your own siblings and leave it at that.", "NTA.  He and his sister are TA's.  If sis is old enough and functional enough to work as a nurse, she's old enough to learn the social contracts that apply to relationships.  If she's not thanking you for a gift AND not reciprocating, yet she's always ready with her \"Gimme List\", then it's time for her to grow up and learn that her behavior is selfish, immature, and alienates people who care about her.", ".NTA \n\nI would start buying her something she won't like.

Even the busiest nurse can take two seconds to send a thank you text.  This is bratty, entitled behavior.  You don't need to feed into it.", "NTA\n\nAs other commenters pointed out this is very obvious, she's all take and no give. One thing I'm curious on though, he asked if you were going to get something for your sister and not are you two going to split a gift for your sister? Why are you expected to split a present with your boyfriend for his sister to begin with?", "NTA.", "NTA His sister, his problem.", "NTA. Everyone has the time to at-least send a thank you text/email/note/message etc. The fact that she expects presents and well wishes and does not reciprocate it is incredibly rude/entitled and your bf is just enabling her. Nurses have days off too so her being busy is a moot point", "NTA. Why does he expect more from you than his sister?  You guys are the same fricken age.", "Lord, you're so much nicer than I am.  I would be so sorely tempted to send her a card along with an itemized bill for the card, the time you spent going to the store to purchase the card, and the stamp, along with a wishlist of what you'd like to receive for your next birthday.\n\nIngratitude and greed are unattractive qualities in adults.

Amy is also the golden child because she\u2019s the youngest. His mom spoils her rotten and treats Adam poorly (they have a bad relationship).

Stand your ground with Adam (he handles Amy\u2019s gifts and you handle your sisters gifts) but I wouldn\u2019t confront till this starts getting into other areas like she\u2019s asking for loans or something bigger. He clearly adores his sister. You will have to tread lightly when it comes to her even when she\u2019s dead wrong.", "Literally my daughter just turned six this year and after opening each present at her party she thanked whoever it was from right then unprompted.

So tell him fairs fair. You get Amy and I\u2019ll get my sister.", "Omg do they deliver to Ireland? My brother would think this is hilarious.", "Yeah that\u2019s still much for me. She can do that with her significant other but everyone else it feels tacky to me. If she wants something she has an adult job with an adult salary and she can buy it for herself.", "I hear you and especially for kids this makes sense. But with all due respect in my family we don\u2019t expect the older generation to buy gifts for anyone but the grandkids. Considering they can be on fixed incomes and have already provided us with so much (school etc). Also if we do an exchange on Christmas it\u2019s a secret Santa with a fixed dollar amount. Most people aren\u2019t dying for something under $25 so again no need for wish lists. But I hear you not everyone was raised like I was.\n\nEdit: also I doubt you are asking your parents for things that cost over $100. Some of these jerseys can be pricey. That feels like a high ask from a grown up to me.", "How about couple's counseling?  He may not come out of the fog without professional help.  And, I totally understand that it's a slippery slope where you're concerned, because you do risk looking (to him) like an AH.", "I\u2019ve thought about this too. He has a low self-esteem and is easily a people pleaser. I\u2019m going to seriously consider bringing this up, thank you!"]}
