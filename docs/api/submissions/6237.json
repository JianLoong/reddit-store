She is a minor and you are her tutor, your wishes are all in this context.\n\nI understand you because I don\u2019t want to be online myself, neither my kid (when he is older, he will decide). Maybe you are too controlling of what goes or doesn\u2019t go online, perhaps, but that\u2019s still your prerogative.\n\nOh, and don\u2019t forget that I he doesn\u2019t remove you from the photo, you can always report it so it will be deleted.", "NTA. If I were you, I'd report the picture to Facebook. I'm pretty sure that they'll take it down somehow!\n\nHope this can prevent you from a family drama.", "NTA. Beside your own horrid experiences w social media, it's literally a safety issue for the little one. Once someone else (or even you) posts a photo publically it's out of your hands. What you're demanding from him is quite literally the bare minimum.", "NTA  you are the parent and you set a wise boundary. There is no discussion about this, he should have said, 'i apologise, this was my mistake I will remove it immediately, can you accept my apology?' Rather than double down that he is right. Sometimes it is how we ourselves make our needs known too,  backing people into a corner makes them defensive. Next time \n'Bob, I'm sure you must have been out of the room last night when I reminded about cropping me a little baby put of any online pictures. I noticed an uncropped one up today can I ask that it is taken down and us cropped out. Thanks, I know you want to protect little baby's online presence too as her uncle'", "NTA. Your kid; your internet safety rules. You can ask FB to take it down directly since your child is a minor and he does not have parental permission to post it.", "NTA He should have asked for permission", "This can be a tough one, but you are NTA. you are concerned about your daughter. There are creeps and weirdos on every corner of the internet, and your BIL is lacking internet literacy. \n\nHe may not realize it, but he is putting your child out there with intimate details about her. That\u2019s not a great idea.", "NTA she\u2019s your daughter and the internet has creeps on it. \n\nINFO is his profile (I\u2019m assuming it was FB?) on private?", "NTA.  Your kid, your rules.  You can report the post to try to have it taken down.", "NTA \n\nIt's your and your daughter's image and information. You (and her other parent) get to decide what ends up online. You're not selfish or delusional for being worried about your child's safety.", "NTA. Anyone who takes and/or posts a foto of someone unconsentually", "NTA\n\nYour child, your rules, others need to abide by that. My sister also doesn\u2019t want her kids faces to be posted onto the internet and we listen and adapt.", "While NTA and understandable about your wishes you do not get to dictate what bil does or does not put on his social media. You can ask if he would take them down, you do not get to tell him to take them down. If you don't want pictures that may inadvertently be posted, don't take them. Once someone takes a picture with their device, it's their property. I'm sure this will get down voted but that's just the way it is.\n\nIt probably would have gone better for you if you weren't combative out the gate and making demands you have no right to make, you can only ask.", "I understand your frustration, but did you need to call up your BIL & demand? Couldn't you have just had a civil chat. Is he digging his heels in because he's on the back foot & responding to hostility, with hostility? Is he hungover & annoyed he's being yelled at on NYD?\n\nGive it a few days, meet in person & discuss it calmly. Explain why you're so worried about pics of your kids online. He'll get it.", "I actually think ESH. If OP doesn't want the picture posted then don't be in the pic to begin with. Instead of placing expectations on others,  be proactive.  Policing other people's social media posts because they don't comply with your desires (potentially unknowingly in this case) is being a bit of an ahole. On the other hand, BIL could also have taken a different line of response  especially if it was a simple situation of him not hearing her. While he may not agree with OPs reasons,  he could show a higher level of care and respect when notified.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Naturally nobody listens and do so frequently. It\u2019s annoying to have people go against your wishes but it\u2019s even worse for you considering that you\u2019re trying to protect your daughter. Idk if I\u2019d cut him out of my family over this, but I\u2019m also used to having my boundaries ignored. Honestly, just think about the absolute worst consequences of following through with this fight and what you get from it.

Good luck!", "NTA.  \n\n\nRequest to censor photo for privacy of children is reasonable, even in family pictures.  \nJust report the picture and try to get it taken down from FB.  \n\n\nBetter one would be to wear mask in photos if you are that afraid.  \nyou can not check each and every post that is being done by the family members and try to police it.  \n\n\nIf everyone follows your request then yeah you are golden but this sort of non compliance also occurs.", "Definitely NTA.\n\nNTA.\n\nRegardless of how far-fetched or how prudent your decision may seem, you are her father, so even a mere BIL\u2019s best intention shall not matter when it comes to respecting your will regarding your daughter.", "NTA - I had the same rule when it came to my kids. My social media didn't even mention I had kids because it was my choice to join and post about my life, which, yes, my life, of course, included my kids, but I felt it would be disrespectful for me to post photos and share stories with the world about them without their consent. I certainly wouldn't like it if someone did that to me.\n\nChildren aren't property that parents have ownership over. I will never understand how a parent will willfully perform an action that is disrespectful to their kids, yet have the audacity to get mad when someone does the same toward them.\n\nAnything can happen on the Internet. You don't know what privacy measures he's taking or who is viewing those pics. You're keeping your daughter safe, and your family needs to respect your request for privacy.", "NTA \nReport it as your likeness. BiL can kick rocks", "NTA. He's irresponsible and selfish.", "NTA. \n\nIf the world was just, you'd need permission to post a pic of someone else on social media. \n\nYou have every right to be pissed. \n\nSocial media obsessed people have a hard understanding not everyone is like them.", "NTA. Report to Facebook, they\u2019ll get it taken down", "Absolutely NTA\n\nyour request is perfectly reasonable and justified.\n\nbtw it looks like you are still being bullied on social media. BIL is on a power trip", "NTA - report it to Facebook. They\u2019ll take it down. Then BIL can blur / cut you guys and repost like he should\u2019ve done in the first place.", "Meh. Pick your battles. Is one photo worth all this family drama?\n\nIf you were hiding from an actual threat, then this level of reaction might be warranted, but for just general social media avoidance, especially when you are actually using social media?  This is a dramatic overreaction.  \n\nIt would have been nice if the BIL had honored your request, but you became the AH when you acted angrily and started making demands and creating a family schism over an innocent photo.\n\n\nYTA", "YTA.  It\u2019s a family picture, not just your daughter.  You are acting as if someone is going to be stalking you enough to search for some photo where your daughter is but one small part.

Pick your battles - this isn\u2019t the one to pick.", "NTA because it is your family's rule.  \n\nbut putting your anxiety on everyone around you is crossing the AH line.

And when a family member posts the kid\u2019s name, that can magnify the problem. There are countless cases of children being stalked or kidnapped due to family members posting their photos and information on the internet.", "I used to use it, a contributing factor into me rarely posting anymore is that I had a stalker a few years ago and I know how the smallest things can be incredibly dangerous especially when someone means you harm", "Yes it is. And if I were her I would report it to meta so the post has get taken down.", "Report the post to FB. They'll remove it.", "The one causing the rift is your BiL for behaving like a child about this and completely disrespecting your wishes.", "If you allow him to dictate your boundaries this time, he will do it again. And it won't get any easier for you.\n\nNTA. He's got some gall, trying to make this his decision for *your child*.

One NYE photo isn't going to lead to this child being in danger.\n\nGain a little perspective.", "Both of you do have valid points. There are predators online but you also have predators at target. Nowhere is 100% safe for kids these days.", "Talk to me after you\u2019ve handled 100s of child predator cases like I have.", "Which only means you have an incredibly skewed perspective and don't actually appreciate the true and actual level of danger.

You lack proper perspective.", "All it takes is one predator. Hope you don\u2019t have kids.", "I fear for your kids, which are subjected to oppressive lawn mower parents."]}
