Next time \n'Bob, I'm sure you must have been out of the room last night when I reminded about cropping me a little baby put of any online pictures. I noticed an uncropped one up today can I ask that it is taken down and us cropped out. Thanks, I know you want to protect little baby's online presence too as her uncle'", "NTA. Your kid; your internet safety rules. You can ask FB to take it down directly since your child is a minor and he does not have parental permission to post it.", "NTA He should have asked for permission", "This can be a tough one, but you are NTA. you are concerned about your daughter. There are creeps and weirdos on every corner of the internet, and your BIL is lacking internet literacy. \n\nHe may not realize it, but he is putting your child out there with intimate details about her. That\u2019s not a great idea.", "NTA she\u2019s your daughter and the internet has creeps on it. \n\nINFO is his profile (I\u2019m assuming it was FB?) on private?", "NTA.  Your kid, your rules.  You can report the post to try to have it taken down.", "NTA \n\nIt's your and your daughter's image and information. You (and her other parent) get to decide what ends up online.

Once someone takes a picture with their device, it's their property. I'm sure this will get down voted but that's just the way it is.\n\nIt probably would have gone better for you if you weren't combative out the gate and making demands you have no right to make, you can only ask.", "I understand your frustration, but did you need to call up your BIL & demand?

Is he hungover & annoyed he's being yelled at on NYD?\n\nGive it a few days, meet in person & discuss it calmly. Explain why you're so worried about pics of your kids online. He'll get it.", "I actually think ESH. If OP doesn't want the picture posted then don't be in the pic to begin with. Instead of placing expectations on others,  be proactive.  Policing other people's social media posts because they don't comply with your desires (potentially unknowingly in this case) is being a bit of an ahole. On the other hand, BIL could also have taken a different line of response  especially if it was a simple situation of him not hearing her.

Idk if I\u2019d cut him out of my family over this, but I\u2019m also used to having my boundaries ignored.

My social media didn't even mention I had kids because it was my choice to join and post about my life, which, yes, my life, of course, included my kids, but I felt it would be disrespectful for me to post photos and share stories with the world about them without their consent. I certainly wouldn't like it if someone did that to me.\n\nChildren aren't property that parents have ownership over. I will never understand how a parent will willfully perform an action that is disrespectful to their kids, yet have the audacity to get mad when someone does the same toward them.\n\nAnything can happen on the Internet.

Pick your battles. Is one photo worth all this family drama?\n\nIf you were hiding from an actual threat, then this level of reaction might be warranted, but for just general social media avoidance, especially when you are actually using social media?

It\u2019s a family picture, not just your daughter.  You are acting as if someone is going to be stalking you enough to search for some photo where your daughter is but one small part.

She had no reasonable expectation of privacy in a family photo in my opinion.  She obviously knew people would want to share the celebration, thus her request.

That is an impactful reason to not want photos shared and would justify in a different manner than just a request.  That is a legit reason (not that you are not entitled just because you want it that way).", "He doesn't", "I would be fascinated to learn where you got your law degree.", "I somehow knew this would come up, but its irrelevant.  One does not need a law degree to be familiar with laws or to read up on them.\n\nI understand that you have a belief about right to privacy. I will admit that privacy laws have a wide variance from one state to another so you may come from a different understanding of them which is fine. As an example of what is commonly considered a privacy law with variance we can look at permission to record (phone call or in person). Some states require a single party to agree (such as mine), some require both or all parties to agree and some differ based on if it's a phone call or in person and if done in the company of others. While this isnt the privacy issue addressed in this post, it simply shows that the belief of a \"right to privacy\" isnt cut and dry when it comes to legality .\n\nEdit: to try and locate legal advice given in more direct relation to the post, I was able to find multiple sources that said the same or similar to [this link](https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/30765/is-it-illegal-to-post-a-picture-of-someone-without-their-permission) below is the relevant info.\n\nSome examples of photos\u00a0taken\u00a0without\u00a0a reasonable expectation of privacy:\n\nA photo of someone standing on a public street saying \"You don't have my permission to photograph me\"\n\n** A photo of a friend in a friend's house, taken by another friend while at the house, assuming the photographer was not there unlawfully (i.e. was invited)**\n\nA photo of another student in class/on campus at school/university, taken by someone lawfully at that place.\n\nBIL was in a family members house with permission.  He has a right to post pictures in this case as there was not likely a legal expectation to right to privacy. (EDIT - unless of course the home owner said they couldn't which is not the case here based on provided details).\n\nI do want to point out that I disagreed with BILs reaction and stated so in my original post. I fully can agree that he should have taken them down when asked out of respect for a family members request \n None of that changes anything else though.", "NTA. Your boundaries should be respected.", "NTA.  Posting pictures of children on the internet requires the parents' permission.  Your BIL not only posted when you told him not to, but gave some personal information.  Let him know, in writing, that if the post isn't down in 24 hours, you'll report to FB and have it taken down, requesting that his account be suspended.  \n\nI understand that you want your child to know her uncle growing up, but uncle has crossed a serious line and, unless stopped, will likely continue to do so.  Stop him.  If he cuts off contact over this, you probably better off without him.", "Report the post and feign ignorance. I don't see how this will cause a rift.", "Shit that predator would get death of life time sometimes y\u2019all gotta stop scaring you\u2019re kids n putting them in bubble wrap let them enjoy the world while telling them theirs bad people out there so u have to watch yourself."]}
