She didn't have to say it was you. She could have just said, \"I don't vape.\" For the default to be, *my sister who is $100 poorer and lacks jewelry at the moment did it.

Basically a cry for help. My parents stuck their heads in the sand and would blame everyone besides me and it just got worse and worse. I'm amazed I lived to finish high school. \n\nAll that is to say- she needs help before she moves on to even riskier behaviors like drugs and unprotected sex", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
