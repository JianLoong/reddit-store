Jewellery is a very personal thing - spending that much money you would want to wear it at least sometimes - if you really don't like it then you should say something.\n\nThe annoying part is he asked what you liked and you told him yet he still just got something he wanted.  So many men do this - so if you are a man (with a woman in your life or someone else that likes jewellery lol) who is reading this, now you know why this makes you an AH.  If your partner tells you what they like, whether you asked them or not, that is what you get them............ its not brain surgery guys.  It really isn't.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit typo", "NAH if he can return it I don't see the problem. If you don't like it you don't like it", "NAH\n\nIt's an unfortunate situation. If you say nothing, he feels great, but you weren't honest, and he might get you more things in a similar style. If you explain the issue, he might feel wretched, and it might undermine future gift confidence. Ultimately,  you know him and your relationship better than we do. I'd tell my husband and get the exchange, but I can tell you that wouldn't be the choice that works for every couple.", "NAH, but do try to be tactful about it? What he did was exceptionally generous, and I'm assuming the heart was chosen as an expression of his feelings for you. :)", "NTA I actually really can't stand heart shaped pendants, rings, etc., so I would be returning it as well.", "NTA", "NTA, tough situation, but I\u2019d let him know that it was just too much money for a gift that you don\u2019t 100% love.

I\u2019m sure he rather you return it and get something you\u2019ll wear vs the necklace sitting in a box.\n\nJust be prepared for him to be less likely to buy jewelry again.

This could be an opportunity for him to learn more about your tastes. It's a little irksome that he asked what you would like and ignored your response.", "Nta-while it would be nice if you liked what he picked out, I\u2019m sure he\u2019d rather you get something you love.

Whenever I get my girlfriend something, like on her birthday, I jokingly say, \"hey- pretend you like it in front of everyone, but afterwards if you don't like it, we can exchange it for something else.\" In fact this just happened. She mentioned earlier in the year wanting a black puffer vest so I bought one from Canada Goose which was a little over a grand. She had no idea I would buy such an expensive gift and thought the money would be much better spent on several work outfits and fancy sushi, so that's exactly what we did. Everyone is happy. She also knows things not to get me because I'm very particular about them including boots/shoes, jewelry, and electronics.", "I\u2019d ask him to exchange it for earrings.

I don't care if a woman doesn't like the jewellery and would take it back and get something she wants in a heartbeet.

I don\u2019t know ANY women that like them", "Yeah just tell him.", "Totally agreed. I guarantee you that women make up about 1% of the buyers of tacky stuff like heart-shaped jewelry. It's the clueless men who are suckers for a sales pitch, \"Oh she'll LOVE it!\"", "This helps, thank you!

I know my fianc\u00e9 got me some clothes for Christmas (I know by how their wrapped).

You should mention these things to the person you\u2019re dating lol, NAH.", "This is the way. Go back together and he can get an idea by what you try on and say you like.  I\u2019m not sure if you saw the receipt or whatever, but if you just clocked it online he may have gotten it on sale not the $700 retail, so be mindful of that when picking something new out.", "He also massively overpaid for it based on what you said about diamond size.", "I always told my husband what ever the jewelry stores are advertising on TV, I don\u2019t want it.", "Aww, man. I must be the odd one out. My husband gifted me a heart-shaped necklace with both of our kids' birthstones on it. I loved it! I have 3 or 4 necklaces with hearts. I'm a girly girl though", "You should put this in your original post. That changes the context", "That makes sense.
