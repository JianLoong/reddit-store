I (31f) have an older brother (37m) who is a narcissist and just a horrible person. He signed his 2 sons (15m) (16m) over to our mother when they were toddlers. My husband and I live on her property with our two kids because she has a good bit of property and she allowed us to build our home on it when we were married. \n\nMy brother has been spending quite a bit of time at my mother\u2019s house. My older nephew has realized what a horrible person my brother is and avoids him as much as possible. The younger one however, constantly follows my brother everywhere. Every morning, my youngest nephew comes to my home for help with his homeschool work and while he\u2019s here, he complains about how annoying my brother is and how he can\u2019t stand him. When I questioned him about why he follows him everywhere if he can\u2019t stand him, my nephew said my mother forced him to do it. \n\nSaturday, my mom and I were sitting on her front porch, watching my kids ride their bikes. I asked her why she was forcing my nephew to do everything with my brother when he\u2019s made it clear he can\u2019t stand him. She was confused so I explained what he had told me while at my house. We also talked about how he is slowly developing an attitude and has started displaying some of the same narcissistic behaviors as my brother. Soon after he came to the porch and she confronted him and he denied everything. I called him a liar and he got mad and started yelling and being disrespectful. I don\u2019t yell at my kids and don\u2019t accept being yelled at, so I told him I was done talking to him and he wasn\u2019t allowed to come back to my house or play with my kids until he can stop being disrespectful and acting like my brother. \n\nI\u2019m the only one that can help with his school work though, and without my tutoring, his grades will suffer. But I can\u2019t allow him to continue with the things he is doing.

There is no reason to let that slide and have him continue to come to your living space until he adjusts that behavior.  As you said in the post he is unwelcome UNTIL he can adjust his behavior so if his grades suffer then that is unfortunate, but ultimately it is in his hands to fix it.  He can apologize and as long as he does not continue the negative behavior he would be welcomed back to continue getting help with his work.", "\"But I can\u2019t allow him to continue with the things he is doing.\"\n\nCorrect.

I feel for this kid, his dead beat dad hanging around again has to be messing him up, but he still has to be respectful of the rest of you and not lie.", "NAH. You need to talk to his guardian about counseling. And perhaps testing. Can this be a genetic/mental health disorder?", "NTA. You are not the only one who can help him with school work. There are whole school districts with people who are trained specifically to help kids learn.", "How old is your nephew? How old are you? Why stoop to his level...", "I didn\u2019t say that to him. I just put that in for context. I just told him he wasn\u2019t allowed to come over until his attitude changed.", "I think you missed the point\u2026 he didn\u2019t confide anything in me because my mom wasn\u2019t forcing him to do anything. He was telling lies to get attention because he knows I don\u2019t like my brother. And then he told more lies when he was caught to try to keep my brother from getting mad at him.", "She didn't make him follow him around. That's the point. He lied. And then lied again by denying he ever said that.\n\nSo either the nephew is lying. Or the mother is. But considering the kid later denied it, it's seeming like the nephew.", "He lied. My mother doesn\u2019t force them to do anything with my brother because he\u2019s a narcissist and uses people. We have all made it clear that we won\u2019t forbid either of my nephews from having a relationship with him, they are allowed to form their own opinions as my older nephew has done. My younger nephew lied and said my mother was forcing him because he knows I don\u2019t like my brother and he didn\u2019t want to lose my help with his homework. But I wouldn\u2019t have refused to allow him to come to my house if he hadn\u2019t lied to me and then again to my mother, along with getting disrespectful and yelling at me. I won\u2019t tolerate that, from anyone.", "Do you think you\u2019ll ever see or speak to him again", "Instead of berating him you could have taken the time to get to the bottom of it and teach him about the behaviors that are wrong. He obviously needs some help. Now the kid is even more crippled he has no safe place and no one to help him with his education he is obviously isolated and has no one else. Poor kid.", "Ah ok. I didn't get that from the post. It sounded as though his lie was denying he told you about it. I retract the y t a.", "So if your younger nephew had said, \"I want to be around my dad because he's my dad?\" Then that would have been okay? \n\nI'm just thinking that he lied because he didn't want to tell you he wanted to be around his Dad..because you obviously don't like his Dad. He didn't feel safe express that, so he lied.\n\nEdit: I just read your reply again...and I guess my question is also more does your nephew know that he can want to be around his Dad without a consequence?", "Considering he lives next door, I\u2019m pretty sure I will. I just need him to learn he can\u2019t get away with lying and being disrespectful.", "Just don't lie and them proceed to yell when you get caught", "Yes. I\u2019ve told both of my nephews numerous times that even though I don\u2019t have a relationship with their dad, I would still support them if they wanted a relationship with him. They are both allowed to have their own opinions of who they want to have in their lives. The issue was not that he was hanging around his dad but more of the fact that he was lying and saying that he was being forced to do it, and the disrespect when he was confronted. The conversation with my mom started because I was prepared to stand up for him because he had made me believe she was forcing him.", "Info: knowing how your brother is why is your mother allowing him around your nephews?", "Info: has anyone asked your nephew why he felt the need to lie about this?\n\nI'm not saying lying isn't wrong. And you're justified in putting your boundaries and your children first. But your nephew is young, grew up mostly without his father. Now he's hanging around, and your nephew is clearly conflicted about what kind of person he is and what kind of relationship he wants with him. He's your nephew, he spends a lot of time at your house, and you don't seem concerned at all about the underlying cause of his behavior.", "NTA.", "I honestly have no clue. I\u2019ve told her more times than I can count that it isn\u2019t a good idea, but she won\u2019t listen. And even though I\u2019ve helped care for them both their entire lives, she\u2019s still legal guardian and has final say. I can only hope the younger one recognizes how awful his dad is before it\u2019s too late. My older nephew has formed his own opinion and has told my brother to stop pretending to be a dad because he has never been a dad to him.", "To answer your question, he has the habit of lying when he thinks he\u2019s in trouble, or if he thinks it will gain him favor. He\u2019s done it since a young age. I\u2019ve tried to correct him when he\u2019s high me, but my mom does not. See the problem? This is just the instance where the straw broke the camel\u2019s back because not only was he lying,but he became disrespectful and started yelling at me too. And that\u2019s behavior I won\u2019t tolerate. \n\nI am concerned because I\u2019m pretty sure his dad has been filling his head with nonsense. Unfortunately, I\u2019m not his legal guardian, and can\u2019t forbid him from being with his dad. I can only hope to prevent him from influencing my kids into doing the same behavior.", "Attitude is too vague a word. Try, no lying, no tantrums.", "It sounds like it might not be the worst idea to start setting up new boundaries with your mom and younger nephew", "Honestly being raised by a narcissist he is very likely to act exactly like hus father. And they are the most self centered, selfish horrible people to deal with. If this child continues to act like his father you and your family will suffer. Hire him a tutor, being that he's homeschooling someone technically should be teaching him. Usually the person who is his parent or guardian is the person who is supposed to do it.", "Obviously this kid wants a relationship with his dad but doesn't think you'll accept it. Instead of just calling him a liar why didn't you ask if he said it in front of your mom? This situation definitely could have been handled better and it sounds to me like you make it uncomfortable.", "You do realize that your mom is the common denominator in raising narcissistic boys, right?", "Why is your brother allowed over there at all? It sounds like he shouldn't be around the kids. Does he pay child support?", "NTA He's playing stupid dominance stupid games & will only win stupid prizes.", "Don't let him yell at you, but don't cut off support from a 15 year old kid. If your mom didn't tell him to follow his dad around, maybe he needs an adult to like him and offer guidance without giving him ultimatums? You're already doing something amazing for him. Maybe continue to model the behavior you want to see, oversee how he acts in your home, and don't ask him questions he might not even be able to answer about why he still looks for affection from your deadbeat brother, who will always be his dad.", "NTA. Consequences, consequences, consequences.", "I disagree. Nephew loves someone who is clearly a toxic person and has signed parental rights away. If he is displaying the same behaviors as his father, then it needs to be called out.", "I\u2019ve always told him and his brother that regardless of my feelings about my brother, I\u2019d support them even if they want to have a relationship with him. Even if I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea, they are allowed to form their own opinions and relationships. The issue isn\u2019t the relationship, it\u2019s the lies and disrespect when asked why he said what he did.", "Lol yep. Luckily I was raised by my grandparents so I turned out ok.", "Good question. He is allowed over because he\u2019s a mama\u2019s boy. And he DEFINITELY should not be around kids. I don\u2019t let mine outside alone when he is over. And no, he\u2019s never paid child support. Actually the opposite, he\u2019s constantly begging for money, even from my nephews.", "I haven\u2019t cut him off completely. I talked to him on the phone today and explained exactly what my issue is. Hopefully he can see how his behavior affects others besides just him. And my husband tries to be a father figure to him, as much as possible, it just seems like he forgets everything my husband has tried to teach him when my brother shows up.", "Is your brother allowed unsupervised visitation?", "Then I have to agree with some others here: your mom is causing this problem even more than your brother.  \n\nAt first I wondered, is the mother telling the truth, or could she have actually told the 15m to go follow his dad around and the kid was telling the truth?\n\nLiving together makes it all complicated.", "He doesn\u2019t live with my brother. My parents have custody. My brother just hangs around a lot, usually when he wants money because he refuses to get a job. He is enrolled in an online school and comes to me usually to help with math because that\u2019s a tough subject for him.", "The kid needs therapy.", "NTA he needs to learn respect", "NTA. Anything outside of having him see the consequences of his lying will help him become a pathological liar into adulthood. Narcissism and pathological lying go hand in hand. They are a complete nightmare and ruin lives. Especially if they have kids. I have known several and have SEVERE trust issues. Some people truly thrive on the attention and chaos they create and he was probably internally thrilled a scene was caused. Stay firm and don\u2019t let him manipulate you as that is where he is getting the benefit of his pathological lying. It\u2019s hard to lie when people won\u2019t give the attention required to lie.\n\nHe need some therapy and communication skills so he won\u2019t resort to pathological lying. Pathological liars don\u2019t care if they destroy themselves and lying and tantrums become their automatic response to EVERYTHING. Sowing discord is not a life strategy. I see you care about your nephew and don\u2019t want him to go down a bad path.", "NTA - BUT the way to get through to a kid isn't to (in his view) reject him.", "Yta. \nYou can teach him what he did wring if you keep him aside.he still young and doesn't have a lot of role models to follow, and now you are keeping him aside.\n\nRecosider talking to him and learn about repairing relationships and trust", "NTA.  You can ban whoever you like from your house, provided they aren't your dependant.", "Seriously. Why are these kids not in school?", "Thank you for calling him on his lies! He needs that type of loving attention & discipline, not punishment. I\u2019m sure he\u2019s been punished unjustly, but never properly or lovingly disciplined. There\u2019s a huge difference. I commend you for all your efforts with him & for not giving up on him! \n\nPlease update us on his progress! Thank you, sincerely.", "But you're an adult and handled it like a child. You blindsided the kid then want to call him a liar? I assume you're that family they're forced to have a relationship with so they accept it but they don't feel comfortable around you. Also your nephew isn't your brother and it sounds as though that's how you treat him.", "Technically no. He signed his paternal rights over. But my mom doesn\u2019t really supervise when he\u2019s over. They tend to spend a lot of time together out of the house so she doesn\u2019t know what is being said and going on.", "Actually I treat him like another of my kids. He usually spends his free time with me, and even calls me his second mom. I know from my explanation, it\u2019s hard to understand what happened, but he wasn\u2019t blindsided. He was just asked a simple question that he then got defensive and blew up over.", "Absolutely! \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f", "Why isn\u2019t he in regular school?\n\nAlso, can your parents limit the time his father is around? Seems it would be good for both boys to experience some normalcy in their young lives.", "Did he ever raise them?", "He had some issues with the students and staff in his jr high school last year. I homeschool my kids as well, so my mom just decided to pull him out because she knew I\u2019d help him if he needed it.", "Never. They have always been with my parents. My brother just finally signed over his rights when they were toddlers.", "Great idea."]}
