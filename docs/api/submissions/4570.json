I (31f) have an older brother (37m) who is a narcissist and just a horrible person. He signed his 2 sons (15m) (16m) over to our mother when they were toddlers. My husband and I live on her property with our two kids because she has a good bit of property and she allowed us to build our home on it when we were married. \n\nMy brother has been spending quite a bit of time at my mother\u2019s house. My older nephew has realized what a horrible person my brother is and avoids him as much as possible. The younger one however, constantly follows my brother everywhere. Every morning, my youngest nephew comes to my home for help with his homeschool work and while he\u2019s here, he complains about how annoying my brother is and how he can\u2019t stand him. When I questioned him about why he follows him everywhere if he can\u2019t stand him, my nephew said my mother forced him to do it. \n\nSaturday, my mom and I were sitting on her front porch, watching my kids ride their bikes. I asked her why she was forcing my nephew to do everything with my brother when he\u2019s made it clear he can\u2019t stand him. She was confused so I explained what he had told me while at my house. We also talked about how he is slowly developing an attitude and has started displaying some of the same narcissistic behaviors as my brother. Soon after he came to the porch and she confronted him and he denied everything. I called him a liar and he got mad and started yelling and being disrespectful. I don\u2019t yell at my kids and don\u2019t accept being yelled at, so I told him I was done talking to him and he wasn\u2019t allowed to come back to my house or play with my kids until he can stop being disrespectful and acting like my brother. \n\nI\u2019m the only one that can help with his school work though, and without my tutoring, his grades will suffer. But I can\u2019t allow him to continue with the things he is doing.

Clearly he loves his father and to say that to him is a bit of a low blow.\n\nBesides that, NTA.  He has to learn to respect you and you have the right to set boundaries as your kids are watching what is happening as well.  After he apologies, have a heart to heart talk with him to see what is really going on with him.", "NTA.  Your nephew was caught in a lie and when confronted with that he became aggressive by yelling and being disrespectful.  There is no reason to let that slide and have him continue to come to your living space until he adjusts that behavior.  As you said in the post he is unwelcome UNTIL he can adjust his behavior so if his grades suffer then that is unfortunate, but ultimately it is in his hands to fix it.  He can apologize and as long as he does not continue the negative behavior he would be welcomed back to continue getting help with his work.", "\"But I can\u2019t allow him to continue with the things he is doing.\"\n\nCorrect.  He'll have to find a new tutor or correct his behavior.  He doesn't get to be an AH and demand you tutor him.  NTA  Hopefully, he'll see reason.", "NTA - set boundaries, enforce them.", "NTA- you are absolutely allowed to demand civility and respect- particularly from children, and even more so from those who are looking for favors/help.", "NTA, don\u2019t bite the hand who feeds you. You have absolutely no obligation to tutor someone that basically say you\u2019re lying and being disrespectful.", "YTA. Your nephew confided in you how he was feeling and instead of being his confidant and helping him through a difficult time you went behind his back and told your mother what he said. You have lost his trust and now this kid has no safe place to go.", "Poor kid. He was put in an impossible situation and acted to protect himself, and now he's got no adults he can trust. If you don't mend things with him fast, you'll likely see more of brother-like behaviour. And why was your mother making him follow your brother around? Why doesn't the elder nephew have to do this too? I don't understand that part of it at all. YTA.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I feel for this kid, his dead beat dad hanging around again has to be messing him up, but he still has to be respectful of the rest of you and not lie.", "NAH. You need to talk to his guardian about counseling. And perhaps testing. Can this be a genetic/mental health disorder?", "NTA. You are not the only one who can help him with school work. There are whole school districts with people who are trained specifically to help kids learn.", "How old is your nephew? How old are you? Why stoop to his level...", "I didn\u2019t say that to him. I just put that in for context. I just told him he wasn\u2019t allowed to come over until his attitude changed.", "I think you missed the point\u2026 he didn\u2019t confide anything in me because my mom wasn\u2019t forcing him to do anything. He was telling lies to get attention because he knows I don\u2019t like my brother. And then he told more lies when he was caught to try to keep my brother from getting mad at him.", "She didn't make him follow him around. That's the point. He lied. And then lied again by denying he ever said that.\n\nSo either the nephew is lying. Or the mother is. But considering the kid later denied it, it's seeming like the nephew.", "He lied. My mother doesn\u2019t force them to do anything with my brother because he\u2019s a narcissist and uses people. We have all made it clear that we won\u2019t forbid either of my nephews from having a relationship with him, they are allowed to form their own opinions as my older nephew has done. My younger nephew lied and said my mother was forcing him because he knows I don\u2019t like my brother and he didn\u2019t want to lose my help with his homework. But I wouldn\u2019t have refused to allow him to come to my house if he hadn\u2019t lied to me and then again to my mother, along with getting disrespectful and yelling at me. I won\u2019t tolerate that, from anyone.", "Do you think you\u2019ll ever see or speak to him again", "Instead of berating him you could have taken the time to get to the bottom of it and teach him about the behaviors that are wrong. He obviously needs some help. Now the kid is even more crippled he has no safe place and no one to help him with his education he is obviously isolated and has no one else. Poor kid.", "Ah ok. I didn't get that from the post. It sounded as though his lie was denying he told you about it. I retract the y t a.", "So if your younger nephew had said, \"I want to be around my dad because he's my dad?\" Then that would have been okay? \n\nI'm just thinking that he lied because he didn't want to tell you he wanted to be around his Dad..because you obviously don't like his Dad. He didn't feel safe express that, so he lied.\n\nEdit: I just read your reply again...and I guess my question is also more does your nephew know that he can want to be around his Dad without a consequence?", "Considering he lives next door, I\u2019m pretty sure I will. I just need him to learn he can\u2019t get away with lying and being disrespectful.", "Just don't lie and them proceed to yell when you get caught", "Yes. I\u2019ve told both of my nephews numerous times that even though I don\u2019t have a relationship with their dad, I would still support them if they wanted a relationship with him. They are both allowed to have their own opinions of who they want to have in their lives. The issue was not that he was hanging around his dad but more of the fact that he was lying and saying that he was being forced to do it, and the disrespect when he was confronted. The conversation with my mom started because I was prepared to stand up for him because he had made me believe she was forcing him."]}
