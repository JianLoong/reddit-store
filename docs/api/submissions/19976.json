She works from home and gets up later than me. Normally this is fine and I have no problem with it. \n\nIn the last few days she has been getting a dry cough before sleep. It doesn't stop her from falling asleep and it doesn't interrupt her sleep. She has had worse coughs before which stopped her from sleeping and I went to sleep on the couch so she could have the bed. Last night she came to bed at the same time as me as usual. We said goodnight and I tried to sleep. She sits up looking at her phone, loudly coughing every 2 minutes. \n\nAfter over 30 minutes of me trying to sleep I ask her if she's waiting for the coughing to stop before trying to sleep. She says no. She angrily asks me if I want her to go to sleep now so I can sleep. I said (as nicely as I could) that we have other rooms if she wants to look at her phone. She gets up without saying anything and goes downstairs.

It just seems really rude and unnecessary to sit up on your phone and cough a bunch next to someone who is trying to sleep, when you have an entire home you can go sit in and be on your phone. I'm willing to bet if you reversed this and did that one night when she was trying to sleep, she would tell you to go to the couch. Just a hunch.", "NTA, I think she should be considerate of you. \n\nYou have to wake up early she doesn't. If she wants to use the phone she can do it anywhere in the house it's not like she comes to bed to spend time with you.", "NTA. All fine and good when she's not coughing and keeping you awake. Really don't know why she didn't suggest it herself (coming to bed later) or even sleeping in another room until the cough is no longer an issue. Couples do it all the time because it's consideration for your partner.", "Has wife considered that her cough may be directly linked to her staying up until 2am most nights and being on her phone until late? When you don\u2019t get enough sleep, you get run down. Her night time behaviour seems linked with her poor health. \n\nNTA for expecting an uninterrupted sleep. This isn\u2019t a one-off, it\u2019s a pattern. Not being funny, but it might not be outwith the realm of possibility to consider separate sleeping arrangements, at least for a while.", "NTA she needs to let you sleep since you get up earlier then her for work and her being on her phone and then coughing every two minutes she should've gone to bed to since she is unwell so NTA.", "NAH.\n\nWhilst you both could have handled it better, most notably by discussing it earlier, and perhaps offering to sleep on the couch til she feels better, this is minor in the scope of navigating a marriage.\n\nOf course if there is something built up you haven't dealt with them this could be the proverbial straw, or if she overreacts to the poorly handled situation on both parts, then I reserve the right to revise my vote", "ESH. Talking about the keeping you awake thing calmly outside the bedroom is preferable to bringing it up in the moment, as is making up a guest bedroom for when the coughing is a problem and you can talk calmly together like loving adults in a marriage about who goes where when. \n\nHas she been to the doctor? That cough could be a larger health problem.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Talk to each other!", "INFO:\n\nDoes your wife take medication for her cough?  Had she taken anything for the cough prior to this conversation?\n\nWhen she was coughing for half an hour, did you offer to fetch her anything like medication, a cough sweet or glass of water to help ease her cough?

Get some silicone ear plugs if it bothers you so much.

That smoke's no joke.", "Lol why is this down voted? Most reasonable comment in the thread.", "Why is it automatically his job to get out of bed and fetch her water or a cough drop?? She's selfishly scrolling her phone and coughing up a lung next to him when she can very easily avoid both on her own by simply being in a different room or using her two legs which I assume work since she got to the bedroom on her own to get up and get a glass of water like most people do when they have a dry cough.", "She's disturbing his sleep in their shared bedroom. It's common sense to not disturb a sleeping person at bed time in the bedroom in BED. He has to leave for work the next day while she can wake up late, and her making noise with her coughing and staying up on her phone will disturb his sleep cycle and will cause him to function poorly at work. She could do that anywhere else in the house. Just because she's awake doesn't mean she has to keep him awake too.", "How dare he try to sleep in the bedroom, doesn't he know that's the only room in the house that her phone gets the internet? Where else could she possibly go... THE LIVING ROOM?! I mean, the couch in there is obviously for sleeping on, not sitting and doing things like looking at the internet.", "Wdym helping her, it\u2019s not exactly rocket science, I\u2019m sure she knows how to get a check up. And we also have no clue if he did ask her if she wants to go to the doctor either or if she has been to the doctor already.", "She\u2019s a grown ass adult and should be going to the doctor on her own.", "Or hayfever. It is apparently worse this year in the UK.", "And there I would refer you to my first question.\n\nThe question as to whether any action was taken to ease the cough goes in both directions, her from taking care of herself and him from being considerate of the possibility that since she was actively coughing she might not feel up to getting out of bed to fetch something.", "There is no fixed \"bed time\", this is not a boarding school.", "When you have a partner in life, sometimes you should also try to show them you care.", "Then she can ask him to get her something instead of sitting there coughing and hoping he will. Presuming she's an adult.", "I'm pretty sure 2AM is bed time for anyone who has work the next morning."]}
