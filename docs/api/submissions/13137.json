She thinks I'm gross for having been a teen mom and she believes her son deserves someone better (i.e a virgin). As you can see, she's very sexist. She thinks I'm an unchaste whore here to ruin her son which is extremely ironic because I was actually married to my daughter's father when she was conceived and he he left during the pregnancy but my fianc\u00e9 had a shotgun wedding to his son's mother when she was 2 months pregnant. \n\nI was at my fiance's house yesterday and we were talking about what role we could put his son in for the wedding. My fiance's mother popped in unexpectedly. She asked about what we were discussing. Fianc\u00e9 told her we were finding a role for his son in the wedding and he said that my daughter was going to be a flower. She responded by saying my daughter should be kept away from the ceremony because otherwise everyone will know he's marrying a 'used woman'. She said it in a different language but I still understood. I saw red and started shouting at her. I've tried to be respectful for YEARS and I had enough. I told her that she was banned from the wedding and my fianc\u00e9 kicked her out his house.\n\nWe're both being bombarded with texts and calls saying that we're wrong for banning her and people specifically asking me to let her come because they know my fiance will keep her banned until I say so. They keep saying that watching your child get married is a beautiful thing and I'm depriving her of that because his first wedding was a mess. I'm starting to feel like I should unban her.

You can also not allow her to come. As long as you and your partner are on the same page. Both options are totally morally acceptable. \n\nNTA\n\nHere\u2019s the thing - I\u2019m getting a \u201cdoesn\u2019t stand up to strong women\u201d vibe from your partner, from the way he only reacted to his mom when you did, from the way he\u2019s letting you take the lead on this decision, and from the way his mother feels empowered to treat his partner. It\u2019s not a real mystery where that comes from - it was a survival skill with his mom. This is fine in your relationship if it\u2019s fine for both of you. But it\u2019s relevant to your decision because you should expect he\u2019s going to look to you for how to react if you decide to let his mom back in, and she decides to complain about you wearing white when you\u2019re a scarlet woman, or whatever.  She clearly feels empowered to do it, and if you unban her, then she knows she can walk on you with impunity, so she\u2019ll probably do it again if she feels like it. So I\u2019d think really carefully about exactly how much you want to deal with her on your wedding day.", "NTA. It's your wedding. If she can't respect her son's wife, she doesn't have a place in the wedding.\n\nAlso does she think her son is pure/a virgin? Lmao what a weird double standard and not an ideology I'd want my daughter exposed to if I had one.", "NTA.\n\nShe did that to herself. She\u2018s an adult and knows that awful behavior has consequences.\n\nYou and your husband should firmly uphold your boundaries. Someone who treats you like this doesn\u2019t deserve to be around on your wedding.", "DO NOT unban her. She sounds awful & you are NTA.", "NTA. The only gross thing here is your FMIL's anachronistic views on gender roles.", "NTA - And your MIL gas made it clear she wouldn't find it \"a beautiful thing. \" she just wants to be there to start a commotion. Have security ready to bounce her, because she'll probably try showing up.", "NTA\n\nIt's your wedding. You've both got children. You're in a very similar position. She's being a hypocrite. \n\nYou can't insult somebody, repeatedly, then expect to be invited to their wedding.", "NTA and if you unban her now she will know that she can keep treating you like this and disrespecting your boundaries. If she apologized, promised to behave and your fiance wanted her there I might reconsider, but the way things are she has no business being there", "NTA\nShe doesn't approve of the marriage, why should she be at the wedding? So it's OK for her son to have been married before, but not for you. No, really, don't let that woman be around your daughter. My dad's grandma was a joyless catholic who tried to ruin the wedding and my grandpa was a sexist ass. You don't need that pain in your life.", "100% NTA. Future MIL is abusive, entitled, manipulative, controlling, apathetic, self-righteous, and antagonistic. What she has said to you is dehumanizing and belittling.\n\nAll those people spamming you with text messages are enablers. Most likely flying monkeys. Flying monkeys doing the bidding of the narcissist.\n\nYou did the right thing.", "NTA. She has no respect for you. She isn\u2019t interested in the wedding, nothing you say or do will change her mind, because you will never be good enough for her", "NTA by a long shot. \n\n>and people specifically asking me to let her come because they know my fiance will keep her banned until I say so\n\nYou need to make sure your future hubby stands his ground. He needs to let people know that you aren't making him do anything, that he completely agrees with you and you aren't forcing him into anything. If everyone thinks he is just blindly doing what you say, it'll paint you in a manipulative light and no one will take what you guys say seriously.\n\nPS: check the subreddit r/justnomil, they can probably give you good advice.", "Oh hells to the no! She needs to stay away until she treats you with respect. If that never happens, so be it. Oh, well. Move on. You've tried for years in good faith. She hasn't changed because there have been no repercussions for her. Time to cut her off.\n\nYour daughter and son will take their cues from how you deal with this level of misogyny. Do you want your daughter to think women are only valued if they are \"pure\"? Do you want your son to think that way? Your wedding is comparatively less important than that issue, but NTA to uninviting her to the wedding too.\n\nNTA", "NTA but like another person here said, expect her to bulldoze her way into the wedding and create a scene. Take precautions", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s important to take a stand before you have more kids. Your MIL is likely to treat your daughter very poorly and your daughter will feel the consequences", "Definite NTA and I'm pleased that your partner booted her from the house. Weddings are meant to be about love, families coming together etc. She clearly has no interest in either of those themes so she can steer clear and learn her lesson\n\nShe was already present at one wedding, she got to see her son walk down the aisle, and look how well that turned out. Now she can miss out on what will hopefully be a long term happy situation", "The women has ISSUES\n\nNTA!\n\nMake sure you and your husband-to-be are in the same page here, so no one can drive a wedge in between!

If you unban her she's going to be an absolute nightmare at your wedding too.", "NTA. If you feel there is still space to mend the relationship with your future MIL, you can consider unbanning her but only after an open conversation about how any future interactions will look like going forward. No more comments about \"used women\", no voicing any kind of opinions that imply women are inferior to men, no mean behavior towards you and your daughter. See how she reacts to your boundaries and decide based on that.\n\n This is not just about the wedding. In fact, it's least of all about the wedding and mostly about the impact of this woman in your life and your children's life in the future. Will she make your stepson into a mysoginist? Will she shame your daughter for trying to be her own person rather than some man's property? Will she meddle into any discussions you have with your husband?

Not that anyone would be interested. No non-religious individual uses such language.\n\nMIL seems to not care that OP is also marrying an 'unchaste whore'. How else could he have produced a son? Abominable double standards though not surprising.\n\nYou are right to ban her from your wedding and you might consider banning her from your life too. I'm sure you would be happier without her in it.\n\nNTA", "NTA but it is harsh.\n\nIf you want to give her one more chance or don't want to have your husband get married without his mother present, I'd talk to her one last time and set out the red lines for you and what it would take for you to lift the ban. If anything would lift it, ofcourse. Have this talk with her with your fiancee and maybe someone neutral so the story doesn't get changed by her.", "NTA. I see this as an absolute win.

How do you know that's how people \"see it that way\"? Doesn't matter what MIL thinks because at the end of the day, it's her son's wedding, not hers.\n\nI doubt either of them want her at the wedding anyway lol.", "Lol stop trying to be slick; with men its different and you know thato, you're expecting him to raise your kid across the board. You even said you ex bounced on you so it gives you more incentive to look for a stepfather.", "My fiance's ex is banned from seeing their son so I've been raising him too, you're not making any sense here, it's not 'different' for men. We are both single parents and the sole parent to our children and when we get married, we're obviously going to continue to care for eachother's children"]}
