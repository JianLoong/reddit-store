Way too often, people don't stand up for their partners when it comes to their parents, and it's shameful, really.\n\nBut your fiance threw her out and is backing you on your decision so I'm glad to hear that at least. \n\nAlso, I think MIL is exactly the type of person I would never want around my young impressionable daughter, or son for that matter, but especially my daughter.", "NTA\n\nYou know she'll make those types of comments before, during, and after the wedding.

If you allow her to attend she will surely make this event terrible as well.", "All of those people need to be calling her and telling her to apologize and beg for forgiveness. Tell them that.

Family is important but so is respect and she has shown you none.", "NTA", "NTA keep her banned until she apologizes. If she can't then she can remain uninvited and make sure to have 2 guards at the door to make sure she doesn't interrupt the wedding. Also her son needs to tell her that virgins at the age they are are not a thing and she needs to either stop pretending this is the medieval times or she can remain a distant relative.
