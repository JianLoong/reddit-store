It\u2019s not a real mystery where that comes from - it was a survival skill with his mom. This is fine in your relationship if it\u2019s fine for both of you.

She clearly feels empowered to do it, and if you unban her, then she knows she can walk on you with impunity, so she\u2019ll probably do it again if she feels like it.

The monitor told the family members to quietly ask the MIL to help them with their clothes in the bathroom and once they were in the hallway, the monitor insisted they take MIL home and didn\u2019t let them back into the reception.

A simple \u201csubject is not under discussion, we can talk about something else otherwise I have to hang up\u201d. My advice stay and keep your family far away from her. If you have the possibility of moving to another city or country, do so. Do NOT have her at your wedding. I swear to you she will upset you and even your daughter on that day.

Not that she gets to watch her son get married.", "NTA\n\nTell anyone who gives you grief about it \"this individual tried to ban my daughter from my own wedding, so we disinvited her. I understand she's upset about it--we obviously are too.\"", "NTA but you should have a talk with your soon to be husband. \n\nNot because of his view or anything, but he should be looking at his stepdaughter as his own, or at least stand up for her. \n\nKeep in mind your fiance fell in love with the 'used woman', and despite the fact you have a daughter. Your children are already best friends and they'd probably be thrilled to be siblings. \n\nYou gotta have a talk about how supportive he's gonna be towards you and your daughter, and how he needs to be more defensive towards you without you having to start it. Because when your MIL is gonna be this vicious, your fiance needs to grow a pair.", "Nta. She's not supportive so she doesn't need to be there, end of story. And did she just arrive from 1950, cause wtf??", "NTA\n\nAnd I\u2019m betting she\u2019s the reason his first wedding was a mess.", "It's up to OP, but, after years of abuse, she has every right to ban her from her wedding (and her life!).

Keep her out of it.", "NTA she is trash.", "People who are telling you that you are depriving her of seeing her son get married should be reminded that she's already seen just that.  \n\n\nPS, WHY was the first wedding a \"mess\"?  Could it have been because of the mother and her actions?  That's another question I'd like to see answered.", "NTA. At the end of the day, the wedding is about you, your fianc\u00e9 and your kids. If you unban her then she won\u2019t learn her lesson.", "I don't understand why she's so hell-bent on going to the wedding of someone she hates and believes is \"used.\"\n\nThis woman is delusional, and all the flying monkeys can buzz right off.\n\nNTA", "NTA.

You\u2019ll probably see more red flags with MIL.", "I have a lot of women who thinks that way in my family. They are usually the worst, by their own standards. I have an aunt who never had anything good to say about my clothes (too tight, too short...). I ended up learning that my uncle met her in a strip-club where my dearest aunt worked, as a stripper.   My grandma (that I loved very much) was strongly opposed to sex before marriage, abortion, and claimed that she didn't had to love those who doesn't have her blood (when a distant cousin was filing for adoption) and when grandma died, grandpa opened up and I was speachless: my granpa only had one kid (my mom). My mom's seven older brothers were born from her first marriage before she met my grandpa. Grandpa that she only married when I was almost 20, when her first husband died (because you know... divorce is bad).
