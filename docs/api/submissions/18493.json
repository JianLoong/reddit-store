You're probably not going to like this advice, but it might be best for you to feign a conversion and pretend to be a good little worthless Christian until you're 18 and your parents can no longer send you to a ~~\"troubled teen\" physically abusive brainwashing camp~~ \"Christian boarding school\". Then get out of dodge as soon as you're legally able.", "NTA - Wow. Can you talk to a school counselor? Seems like this is bordering on child abuse.", "NTA, I hate it when Christians force their beliefs onto others. \nIs there any other place you can live?  I do not know how these boarding schools are now, but in the past, they were run by very abusive people.  Although, based on your last paragraph it sounds like she is find with you being abused. Maybe get protective services involved?", "NTA, but since screaming at your mom only seems to be reinforcing her beliefs, maybe tone it down. \n\nAlso, refusing to get you medical assistance when you are sick is neglect.  She has a legal obligation to get medical help for you when you are sick.", "I'm going to have to say NTA. Most of my friends are very religious and none of them try to force it on anyone.", "NTA\n\nYour mother refused to get you medical attention when you were ill. That's abuse. No other word for it.\n\nTalk to your school councillor, principal, or a trusted teacher. Your mothers behaviour is not acceptable, and you need to shine a light on it.", "NTA, but you have two years before you can legally leave home, so choose your battles. I suspect you are safer at home attending public school (where you could seek help from teachers if you were physically abused or in need of medical treatment) than you would be at boarding school. If you can stomach it, apologizing and agreeing to go to church might head off the boarding school idea. Sitting through church services without protesting may be the price you need to pay to keep yourself physically safe for two years while you make an exit plan for moving out as soon as you can.", "INFO: how old are you?", "NTA. Your beliefs are your own, and no one has the right to force their beliefs onto you when you've already expressed that you're not interested.\n\nThat being said, screaming and shouting is not helping your cause. If you want your rights respected, you need to respect others' in return. I remember being 16, and it's a hard age, especially with parents that don't listen. Learning how to communicate your concerns and thoughts calmly is hard, but will likely serve you for the rest of your life in situations like these.\n\nDo you have a family member or close friend you can call in moments like these to vent? Having someone who will just let you rage to them over the phone may help avoid the urge to yell at your mother, and may help you formulate how best to approach her afterwards. You will likely never change your mother's beliefs and actions, but if you appear level-headed and calm when talking to her, you're giving her less ammunition to attempt to \"prove\" her case.", "NTA for yelling.  You need coping skills AND a legal guardian of some sorts to prevent forced boarding school.  If in the U.S go to a trusted adult at your school or a friend\u2019s parent.  You yelled\nbecause you\u2019re frightened and at your wits end.  NOT because you\u2019re in Satan\u2019s grasp.", "NTA\n\nlast paragraph makes me think you're in a religious abuse type situation, hope you turn 18/are able to leave soon", "NTA. You're underage. Your parents own you until you are 18. Be safe and kiss ass enough not to be sent away. \n\nDo NOT run away. The street is **incredibly dangerous.** You would be safer at most US (not international) boarding schools.\n\nIf it's too late, you need a very good plan. The cops will help them, and any adult who helps you escape can be charged. \n\nStart arranging crash space with a friend, a job, a way to keep your wages away from your parents, a way to finish school, a burner phone, an emergency go bag, maybe a bicycle or skateboard. The good news is that cops don't look much for teenagers, so if you can get somewhere safe, they will probably leave you alone.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry this is happening. Maybe there is a trusted adult in your life or at school you feel comfortable enough talking to them about this situation. It really is tough. I'm not telling you to go along with what your mom wants but getting fed up and immediately getting angry is never going to help. I understand those feelings, I really do. \n\nWe should treat others how we want to be treated. Would your mother appreciate you trying to stop her from going to church and forcing her to be an atheist? She probably doesn't like being insulted and having her religion disrespected but she doesn't just get to try and change you. Even deeply religious people need to step outside of their box for a moment. There is no right or correct religion and everyone thinks the one they're apart of is the right one. She wants the best for you and she thinks religion is it. But she really just needs to love and accept you for who you are. That's what her Jesus would do.", "Not sure where you are, but this \"For example, when I was really unwell and in need of medical assistance, I begged my mother to take me to the doctor for medication. She declined, claiming that not believing in god was \"my choice,\" just as it was \"her choice\" to refuse.\" Is called medical neglect and CPS worthy in the US. \n\nTalk to a teacher and/or counselor at your school. You are being coerced into religious beliefs that you don't have and are being punished by ***medical neglect*** if you don't acquiesce. \n\nCould you be nice about religion? Sure, but I'm betting that you've tried that route. \n\nNTA and sending good thoughts your way. Hope it gets better for you very soon.", "NTA.  Remember that she may be able to control your physical actions (where you live, what you wear, etc.) for a while, but she can never control your mind.", "This is a tough one because it speaks to me on a personal level. I grew up in a very similar situation. It's incredibly frustrating, to say the least, and I felt the same rage that you're feeling now when I was your age (ugh, saying that makes me feel so old). I got the same threats of being sent away to either boarding or military school. I came to learn that my rage was not helping anything. I was so angry that no one was listening to me and that I couldn't get through to my parents, and that was enough to make me want to burn the place down. However, me raging at them only solidified their stance that my \"misguided beliefs\" were making me crazy and that only Jesus or the military could save me now. The fact of the matter is that her beliefs run as deep as yours do, as insane as they seem to you. She thinks you're just as wrong as you think she is, and she genuinely believes that you'll burn in hell for eternity if you don't \"see the light\". That is an absolutely terrifying thought for a parent that cares for their child. To her, she needs to do this to protect you. She felt strongly enough about this to bring a pastor into your home. Raging and ranting often only pushes people further from seeing anything on your side, especially Christianity is concerned because they'll only attribute your anger to the devil making you stray from God. Anger (although it is a completely natural reaction to frustrating and stressful stimuli) creates distance and raises barriers. It can be really hard (near impossible, really), but taking the calm and collected stance often works best in scenarios like this. Lead by example. Show her why your way works. It's exhausting and infuriating when you try to fight the good fight for a long time and still aren't making any progress, but it's your best shot, IMO. In the end, I don't think YTA for being frustrated and angry with this situation, but I do think it needs to be handled differently if you want any progress to be made.", "I really want to give a N T A, because that entire situation does sound infuriating. But I'm going with ESH, not because yelling was disrespectful, but because you are hurting your own cause. \n\nScreaming and throwing a tantrum and locking yourself in your room will work to end the immediate argument, but it provides \"confirmation\" to your parents that YOU are problem, and not them (obviously you have a right to your own religious choices, but it reinforces those beliefs in THEIR heads).\n\nSpend time coming up with rational arguments and try not to lose your cool. Point out contradictions, or the atrocities of the church as reasons for your lack of support of the church. Granted that this tactic probably won't convince them of anything, but being level headed during the conversations and having facts to fall back on instead of yelling should go a long way.", "ESH\n\nYelling at anyone isn't going to fix the issue. Your mom is going to continue to push her religious beliefs on you, so you need to just accept that it is going to continue to happen.\n\nWhat you should do is arm yourself against them.  Go research online counter arguments to their religious bs that you can use and the next time anyone brings up Christianity with you, you will be ready to ask them dozens and dozens of questions instead of being forced to passively listen to them trying to preach to you which will force them to be defensive instead of them forcing you to be defensive. \n\nThe best defense is a good offence.", "ESH. You can believe what you believe, but you\u2019re acting like a child. Also, it\u2019s probably a good idea to fake it until you\u2019re out of their house. Do the bare minimum of their silly song and dance, then emancipate yourself completely as soon as possible.

Yelling and storming around like you are while throwing your atheism in your mom's face has more than a little lightning rod to it, since it essentially creates a self-fulfilling belief for her that you're acting this way because of your lack of belief rather than in spite of it.\n\nI've been where you are, did the forced church-attendance thing growing up, then ended up not attending as an adult, making my peace with whatever's out there on my own. My mother and I agreed not to talk about religion, with me occasionally going with her when I visited and her realizing that if she wanted her daughter in her life, she needed to not press the issue. That said, at the moment you're a minor, so your ability to set limits is a bit restricted due to age and living situation.\n\nMy advice would be to try to go with your mom to church - sit quietly and respectfully through the service, and decide where your line is. But all the ruckus is only going to cause you more trouble, when you only have to get through two years until you can take control of your own life. Overall, though, NTA.", "N T A for not wanting to adopt a religion you don\u2019t believe in. Your question is whether you\u2019re the AH for screaming. The answer to that question is yes. Screaming and yelling is not getting you the results you want and in fact appears to be rejnforcing this idea that you\u2019re \u201clost to the devil.\u201d Regardless, screaming is seldom the best way to get your point across in a disagreement, whether religious or not. My suggestion is to respond with firm politeness again and again. \u201cNo thank you, I don\u2019t believe.\u201d \u201cThanks but I\u2019ve given this a lot of thought and your way is not my way.\u201d \u201cI agree I shouldn\u2019t have shouted, but my position is still the same-I\u2019m not interested in your religion, period.\u201d Now do I think this will stop them from trying to convert you! Sadly no. But you can take the high ground and be civil (giving them less ammunition)  until such time as you can get out of there. Sorry you have to deal with this.", "NTA, but you're a \"youthful idiot.\"  (No insult intended.)   You need to understand that your parents are in a position of power over you.   By yelling and being dramatic you are only escalating the situation and exacerbating your problems.   I'm not telling you to lie, but act with more discretion; when you are older you can do whatever you want whenever you want. And when you are ill tell a teacher.  If you feel very ill, and they will not get you to a doctor, call 911.", "As a Christian, this is good advice OP.  There is nothing worse than these \"Christians\" showing unchristian behavior. I'm afraid your family will hound you until you are in a position to go NC. I found at your age avoidance worked. Spend as much time as you can at school and with friends and avoid being in your egg donors and her kinds presence.", "This is what I came to say too..  Nicely put. \n\nOP- NTA", "OP, LISTEN TO THIS COMMENT. There are lots of stories about Conversion Camps out there: boarding schools, 'summer' camps, etc. There are a lot of variations--turning around a 'troubled' kid because of drugs/alcohol/crimes, making queer kids strait, and religious. Physical and mental abuse, including things that are legally defined as torture, and occasional deaths are KNOWN about, and once you get in getting out may take you well past age 18. People who get out are known to have PTSD and be suicidal, among other problems.\n\nDealing with your mom is no picnic, or your extended family, but playing along may be necessary for your own safety. No matter how much you hate it, apologize to your mother for your behavior. Agree to go to church on Sundays--don't agree that you'll become Christian, just that a few hours a week when you'd rather be sleeping is a fair trade for your life. Bite your tongue like a stapler. Start getting things together--birth certificate, passport if you've got one, social security card; say you need them for class assignments and photocopy them and give back the photocopy (if you think she won't notice) or spend a couple hours at the library (school OR public!) researching how to get new copies mailed to you. Get a part-time job, if she'll let you, and squirrel away money. You need to be ready to run the second you turn 18.", "Depending on what state OP lives in, medical neglect of children is allowed as an interpretation of the parents' freedom of religion. Jehovah's Witnesses and some Pentecostals/evangelicals believe that if they aren't healed by faith alone, they aren't faithful enough. It's a very tricky area legally and while some very, very sick children (usually cancer patients or other long term illnesses) have been removed from their homes over medical neglect, but it's hit or miss depending on the area and prosecutors there.\n\nEdit: I am not condoning this behavior on the parents' part at all, and OP absolutely should seek help from a trusted adult. There just may be a limit on what can be done.", "The plan should be to wait until reaching age 18, then drive the mom as crazy and miserable as possible, then leave. Leave her blaming herself but for the wrong things.", "I'm 16.", "Unfortunately from OP's post it sounds like the whole family might be card-carrying cult members. The grandparents definitely are.", "I was with you until the trying to convince them rationally part. These are not the kinds of Christians that can be reached with logic. If you\u2019re bringing in pastors and threatening religious boarding school, you\u2019re not just drinking the kool-aid, you ARE the kool aid! These kinds of people don\u2019t want their children to question anything, just blindly obey. But OP needs to realize her family is a lost cause and not bother engaging them in any religious discussion. \n\nI\u2019d also be looking into emancipation laws in their area.", "OP *is* a child, so it's reasonable to act like one.", "You understand that religion, particularly Christianity and its branches, can be incredibly harmful right? \n\nAnyway no one should be forced to go to church, that's also bad.", "> Mom and her Minister should know that pressure & force basically NEVER converts young people. \n\nMother would probably be happy if OP just pretended to believe.  When this kind of thing happens it's usually about appearances, not reality.  Mom gets embarrassed when the old cats at church ask her ever so sweetly, \"And where is OP?  We haven't seen him/her at church for such a long time!\"", "Making sick (but treatable) children die for Jesus. Ideally it would be punishable as murder.", "Christian Scientists, not Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses.", "Jehovah's Witnesses most certainly don't believe in that bullshit. Don't be lying about things you know nothing about.", "Bide your time.  Sadly, while you\u2019re still a minor, there isn\u2019t much you CAN do. Your parents house; their rules.  Maybe get an after school job, save your money, and maybe find an apartment with a roommate when you\u2019re 18 and can legally move out.  \n\nTry and not yell at your parents.  There\u2019s no sense in making an already difficult situation worse for yourself.  Good luck, op. Soft NTA.", "My entire family is devoutly religious, my mother being the worst. When I was younger, she would lock my siblings and me in a closet and threaten to send us to hell if we didn't kneel down and repent. She wanted to hear us pray, and if our prayers weren't loud enough or didn't satisfy her, she would smash things against the closet, and we were horrified.", "Which is a shame, but not surprising. It might be a good idea for OP to work on strengthening their support system (or building one). It'll definitely come in handy in two years if/when they go low/no contact", "Like I said, it is unlikely that you will actually convince them of anything, but being able to keep a level head and make points calmly takes away the \"devil controlling my misbehaving child\" angle. You are right that engaging in debate probably won't work, but my point was more of HOW OP is engaging currently. Screaming and tantrums will not help their situation in the slightest, and will only add fuel to her parents' fire.", "Sure, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t take the high road. You\u2019ve gotta grow up sometime. They\u2019re 16, not 12.", "Yeah, I was thinking that too. The house call by the Pastor makes it sound like there is a social pressure component.", "FIRST DEGREE murder by a person with a legal responsibility for the child's well being.", "JWs will allow their children to die if the require a blood transfusion. There is also a very real distrust of mental health professionals among their members. \n\nThose are not lies.", "I'm so sorry you have been abused by someone you should be able to trust. Please tell a trusted adult.", "I'm so sorry you're having to put up with this. You had the rotten luck of being the single good egg in an entire basket of bad eggs.", "Completely agree with you there! Ha! Just clocked your username!!!", "Nope... Her actual best bet is to get the hell out of there... \n\nStaying calm doesn't take anything away, the devil has sweet tongue and blah blah blah.... The simple fact that she doesn't believe is enough for them to dismiss anything she says as coming from the devil...\n\nWhat she needs to do, is find a part time job, put as much money as possible aside, play along a bit and get out as soon as she is 18...", "By all such persons."]}
