{"id": 26071, "submission_id": "1683n5l", "title": "AITA for letting my friend struggle with her newborn baby?", "selftext": "I (f,31) have a friend (32), let's call her Laura. We've been friends since elementary school, but our relationship had a few rough patches. We're close, but she can be a little self-centered and callous. I know it's rooted in childhood trauma and it's not intentional. She suffers the most from constantly driving people away, but sometimes it's still hard to stay by her side. \n\nLaura had a one night stand, and got pregnant. I told her it would be irresponsible to be a single mom when she can barely support herself, but she's decided to keep it anyway, so now she has a 2 month old daughter, Mia. \n\nShe had to quit her job halfway through the pregnancy, because it was harder than expected, and obviously can't go back in the near future. She's also depleted her savings and now her only income is child care benefit and monthly allowance from her parents until she can get a job, but it's not enough to cover her expenses. \n\nLast week she came up with the idea that they could move into my guest room. She thinks it'd be perfect, because I own the apartment so there's no rent, we can split bills and groceries, I can watch the baby when Laura's tired and she can help out with chores while I'm working.\n\n I said no, and couldn't even explain why, because she immediately started screaming about how I'm a selfish, heartless AH, how can I be so cruel and cold, and that I don't understand what she's going through. I tried to tell her to move back home because I know Laura's mom already offered it, but she called me an AH again, because as a mother she can't live with her parents. \n\nEven though she can be a bit entitled, it's never been this bad, so her behaviour came as a surprise. I gave her a few days to calm down, then I called to explain that while I love them both, I can't take them in. I've already helped Laura buy newborn essentials, and I told her I can help cleaning or cooking, so she can have some rest, but I can't do anything more. I've recently been diagnosed with panic disorder, I'm at the end of my rope and I'm clearly not in the mental or emotional state to basically adopt a family.\n\nShe started crying and said that she's disappointed in me, because I have no idea what it means to be a mother, and I don't even try to understand her situation. Then she told me she's not sure anymore if they even need me in their life.\n\nI feel guilty and terrible for not being able to do more for them, especially for Mia who doesn't deserve to grow up like this, and I know Laura needs help because being a single mother is terrifying, but I can't do more. I can't do more. She says a real friend wouldn't put herself first, but if I don't put myself first now, I'm not sure I'll ever be able to recover from this disorder. But maybe she's right, and I'm just being a selfish AH now.

If she\u2019s a real friend, she would see that your are also struggling. She only cares about herself. I can\u2019t believe she had the nerve to invite herself into your apartment. \n\nIf you don\u2019t put yourself first, WHO WILL?", "NTA\n\nHoney, Laura wants to move in with you instead of her parents because she knows her parents won\u2019t let her foist all responsibility for the baby off on them. Asking, then tantruming didn\u2019t work so now she\u2019s going for emotional manipulation with tears and threats to cut you off. \n\nCall her bluff and let her. Guarantee she\u2019ll be back when she realizes no sane person without a sunk-cost fallacy will put up with her.\n\nIn the meantime, think about what you put into this friendship versus what you gain. I suspect there is a HUGE imbalance.\n\n(If you think she is struggling emotionally/practically, contact her parents maybe)", "**NTA**\n\n*Laura* has a consequence and now wants to freeload off of you? You might be dodging a bullet if she cuts you off.", "She acts just a little entitled??? No how about entitled in a major way.  She's the one who got pregnant and quit her job because it was too hard.  She has an expectation of  everyone taking care of her in the manner SHE sees fit.  Sorry that is not how the world works.  She should be able to find daycare and start working.  Yes, being a parent, especially a single parent can be hard.  This is what SHE chose.  It's no reflection on you for drawing boundaries and not taking her in and supporting her.  It's rather presumptuous of her to assume that this would be ok.  I don't care if she has an abuse history in the past.  She's making these decisions and nobody else.  You are NTA here and stick to your boundaries.  She needs to figure this out and it's not on you to support her or her newborn daughter.", "NTA. She is not entitled to a free home and childcare on your dime. If you let them in they'll never leave such a sweet deal. Its in no way your problem, you could easily rent out that room to someone willing to pay.", "NTA. She wants you to provide free housing and childcare and is planning to give nothing in return. (Splitting the bills maybe saves a couple of bucks but splitting the groceries could mean that you would pay more than you eat.)\n\nAlso she has an opportunity to move to her parents.", "Laura's a choosing beggar (check out the choosing beggars subreddit) \n\nShe has help but won't accept it unless it's on her terms.

Won't that be fun!?\" You know she also wouldn't help with housework or pay you once she moved in. You made the right choice. NTA", "NTA and huge red flags.\n\nDon't let her move in with you. She's gaslighting you, a real friend would understand that friends have boundaries and don't set themselves on fire to keep other people warm. If she follows up on her ultimatum then you dodged a bullet IMO.", "NTA she chose to keep it, she can cope and figure it out herself (assuming you arent it's sire)", "NTA\n\nBeing her friend doesn't mean she's entitled to any of your help, let alone demanding that you essentially co-parent her kid", "Nta unless *you* got her pregnant, you do not need to provide for her and baby.  This is her reality now.  She literally has a room at home but wants to keep playing her 'I'm an independent adult!' fantasy.", "Why not require the deadbeat dad to pay?", "NTA.\n\nWhat many first time parents don\u2019t realize is, taking care of a newborn can be much more difficult, time consuming, exhausting, and frustrating than they could have ever imagined. And while it\u2019s ok to ask for help, it\u2019s not ok to expect someone else to take on their parental responsibilities. \n\nIt was inappropriate for her to suggest the arrangement in the first place and completely out of line for her to get upset with you for saying no. She has help (her parents). She doesn\u2019t want to accept it for whatever reason(s). And that\u2019s not on you.\n\nGood on you for creating healthy boundaries. You still care for your friend and are willing to support her. But you\u2019re not willing to step in and be the parent.\n\nEdit: grammar", "Please, please read this and really hear what I am saying. Your friend is guilt-tripping and manipulating you. She expects you to manage her emotions and her problems, probably because you always have and this is now your pattern. She is a mother now, which means putting her child first and doing whatever she needs to do to care for that child, including moving back in with her parents. You are not her mom, you are not Mia\u2019s mom, this is not your problem to manage. Your friend\u2019s actual mom is offering her a home and help, but \u201cLaura\u201d doesn\u2019t like that option\u2026that\u2019s too damn bad, it\u2019s the only option she has; she can either take it or shut up. Please do not let her manipulate you into taking on more than you can. I\u2019m so very proud of you for standing up for yourself, but it can be hard to stay strong (I, unfortunately, know this all to well myself). Do NOT give in. Your friend and her baby will be just fine, she will eventually choose to move in with her mother or she will get a job\u2026in essence without you managing her problem for her, she will eventually step up and do it herself. There\u2019s a reason people like this drive others away, don\u2019t keep lighting yourself and your life on fire so she can roast marshmallows. NTA, and please protect yourself and your mental health. \n\nPs there is a very real chance your friend\u2019s behavior throughout the years has contributed to this panic disorder. I have a sneaking suspicion (based on personal experience and years of therapy) that when you stand up to her and refuse to allow her to push you around your mental health just might improve\u2026and it would improve much more if you take a long break from this friendship.", "NTA. She wants to move in with you rent free and use you as free childcare..... she's taking the piss. \n\nHer mom has offered, you aren't leaving her in a problematic situation - she's choosing to put herself in one.", "NTA\n\nLaura chose to be a single Mom.  She can't just decide make her friend be a coparent.", "NTA\nShe isn't your friend. She's taking as much as she possibly can from you,  she's a leech! And she has the option to go back home where her parents will care for her and her child but she would rather manipulae and upset you than bring her daughter to a safe and reliable place.", "You did NOT have a child, Laura did.\n\nYou are not responsible for child, Laura is.  She made this choice.  \n\nIt is hard to be a new parent.  It is VERY hard to be assignee new parent.  \n\nit is NOT uour problem\n\nNTA", "NTA \u201cI don\u2019t think we need you in our life \u201c apparently they do, because they just tried to MOVE INTO YOUR HOUSE! So she\u2019s straight out bluffing, she may go low to no contact for a bit  because \u201cI\u2019ll show her!!!\u201d Then she\u2019ll give you another chance to be her unpaid staff. I would suggest you not pick up that phone, as much as you may be tempted because you\u2019re worried about the baby, she has other options\u2026 but by using you instead of her parents, people, even adults, tend to regard their parents as the voice of authority, so if she\u2019s being an ass they can and will call her on it. If she\u2019s in with you, you\u2019re equals, but she regards her status as a mother as elevating her to priority status over you, so any time you call her on her crap \u201cYou don\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like the a mom!!!\u201d And she is gonna weaponize the hell out of that. And when you finally are fed up, how the hell are you going to get her OUT of your house?!?! Stay far away my friend. She\u2019s using you already, and she\u2019s just trying to force you into accepting a more efficient way of her doing so.", "NTA.\n\nJust because she didn\u2019t realise how difficult it would be to look after a baby on her own, that doesn\u2019t entitle her to move into your spare bedroom and take over your home.\n\nWhy is she fine moving in with you, but not back to her parents\u2019 house? Is it maybe because she thinks she can get away with doing very little and making you look after her baby? Maybe her parents wouldn\u2019t put up with things that she thinks you will.\n\nDefinite red flag. Don\u2019t wait for her to decide if they need you in their life. Cut ties and don\u2019t look back!", "LOL this is ridiculous. NTA if she\u2019s trying to manipulate you like that you\u2019re better off not having her in your life and should cut her out", "NTA, Everyone has limits, and it is right of you to let your friend know what yours are. She's not a kid. She can put her life together if she joins forces with other single parents\u2014that's where her support will come from, in a give and take with people in her situation. She can get an apartment with another single mom, they can take turns watching the kids and they can reach out to other parents, single or not, and that will be her network moving forward. What she is asking of you is completely selfish and unworkable, and has nothing to do with friendship.", "Entitled. Manipulative. Irresponsible. Condescending.\n\nThese are the words that come to mind when I think about Laura. \n\n\u201cYou would do this if you were a real friend.\u201d \n\u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be a mother\u201d. \n\nAs a real friend, you recommended not having the child as she is unable to support herself let alone a child. That sounds like the right call. You are an adult who has made a choice not to have a child and recognise the circumstances in which it is optimal to have one. \n\nYou DO need to put yourself first. She needs to put her child first\u2026 and move home with her parents. As a mother, she should know this.\n\nNTA. Block her and move on.", "Don't let her into your home, depending on where you live it could take years to get her out. In some cases it'd be easier to sell the apartment then get her out.  It is perfectly reasonable to have boundaries and say no even if she didn't have anywhere else to go.  But she does and a lot of single parents move back in with their parents at some point.\n\nAt the very least you owe it to yourself to go LC/NC.  Maybe in a few years when the kid is in school she'll be able to take the time to reflect and realize how crazy and unreasonable she was.", "Sounds like she\u2019s asking you to coparent. \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. Do not feel guilty. And take care of yourself first. You\u2019ll be useless either way to yourself and anybody else if you get to the point of breakdown. \n\nShe needs to back off and het her entitled behind back to her parents. She\u2019s a leech!", ">as a mother she can't live with her parents.\n\nYes, she can.

Laura is being incredibly selfish and has been since she decided to keep Mia when she clearly can\u2019t support herself let alone a child. She even has other options she\u2019s just trying to get what SHE wants out of you. She literally said \u201cif you won\u2019t give me what I want then I don\u2019t need you\u201d - this is about as blatantly manipulative as it gets.\n\nI know losing close friendships is hard, but you might have to let this one go. Just because someone has trauma doesn\u2019t absolve them of their  consistently shitty behaviour and it doesn\u2019t mean you have to put up with it. ESPECIALLY if you have your own mental health issues that are clearly being affected by this person. If Laura ends up alone with only her parents to rely on she\u2019ll only has herself to blame - not that she\u2019ll take responsibility, which again is part of the problem. She can only fix herself and the first step to admitting you have a problem is recognizing it exists and until she does, there\u2019s nothing you can do.", "NTA. \n\nLaura is not your friend. She is a leech and a bully.  Do not feel guilty at all.", "NTA and you should simply say \u201cI think you are correct that we should part ways. I wish you the best.\u201d And leave it at that. Because this is not a person you need in your life. Her choices are hers alone and she needs to deal with the consequences and figure out a path forward.

So you have nothing at all to feel guilty about.", "NTA.\n\nIf you let Laura and her baby move in with you, you will for sure be supporting them both.

You will do the lion share of chores, childcare, child expenses, bill payment, grocery, etc. \n\nLaura wants to live off you, for basically free. She will not get a job, or contribute to your lives together. She is not a good friend. She expected you to say yes, and is incensed at your resistance. She never expected a no from you, and is now lashing out. \n\nShe is trying to manipulate you into giving way to her. She has another option, that has willingly offered for her to move in. She doesn\u2019t want to take it, because her parents will hold her accountable, and will demand accountability from her. Laura does not think you will, and that you are a push over. Using her kid as a bargaining chip, is callous. \n\nYou need to look to your own health, first. It\u2019s Laura\u2019s sole responsibility to care for her daughter. To me, it sounds like she has \u2018buyer\u2019s remorse\u2019 over having a kid, and is looking for handouts and an easy way out.

That's not on you, that is her deciding to struggle for no reason beyond her pride. \n\nIt sounds like she needs therapy, but again, that is something that she needs to take care of, not you. You are her friend, you do not have to be her only support if it's not something you want or can healthily handle.\n\nI am so proud of you for standing up for yourself and setting firm boundaries. Stick by them. It's what you deserve. \n\nNTA", "Whoa, NTA . Don\u2019t feel guilty, motherhood was a choice that SHE made.\n\nIt could be PPD, and she needs support.

We've been friends since elementary school, but our relationship had a few rough patches. We're close, but she can be a little self-centered and callous. I know it's rooted in childhood trauma and it's not intentional. She suffers the most from constantly driving people away, but sometimes it's still hard to stay by her side. \n\nLaura had a one night stand, and got pregnant. I told her it would be irresponsible to be a single mom when she can barely support herself, but she's decided to keep it anyway, so now she has a 2 month old daughter, Mia. \n\nShe had to quit her job halfway through the pregnancy, because it was harder than expected, and obviously can't go back in the near future. She's also depleted her savings and now her only income is child care benefit and monthly allowance from her parents until she can get a job, but it's not enough to cover her expenses. \n\nLast week she came up with the idea that they could move into my guest room. She thinks it'd be perfect, because I own the apartment so there's no rent, we can split bills and groceries, I can watch the baby when Laura's tired and she can help out with chores while I'm working.\n\n I said no, and couldn't even explain why, because she immediately started screaming about how I'm a selfish, heartless AH, how can I be so cruel and cold, and that I don't understand what she's going through. I tried to tell her to move back home because I know Laura's mom already offered it, but she called me an AH again, because as a mother she can't live with her parents. \n\nEven though she can be a bit entitled, it's never been this bad, so her behaviour came as a surprise. I gave her a few days to calm down, then I called to explain that while I love them both, I can't take them in. I've already helped Laura buy newborn essentials, and I told her I can help cleaning or cooking, so she can have some rest, but I can't do anything more. I've recently been diagnosed with panic disorder, I'm at the end of my rope and I'm clearly not in the mental or emotional state to basically adopt a family.\n\nShe started crying and said that she's disappointed in me, because I have no idea what it means to be a mother, and I don't even try to understand her situation. Then she told me she's not sure anymore if they even need me in their life.\n\nI feel guilty and terrible for not being able to do more for them, especially for Mia who doesn't deserve to grow up like this, and I know Laura needs help because being a single mother is terrifying, but I can't do more. I can't do more. She says a real friend wouldn't put herself first, but if I don't put myself first now, I'm not sure I'll ever be able to recover from this disorder. But maybe she's right, and I'm just being a selfish AH now. AITA?   \n\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

She moved back in with my mum, because she couldn't afford to live alone with a baby on her current salary. The pregnancy wasn't difficult or anything, so she continued working her minimum wage job until she got into the police. She was placed in a force too far away to continue living with our mum, so instead my mum paid her rent on a cheap flat until she could save up from her higher wages to get something else. \n\nMy sister never actually got her own place that way, as she met her future husband during training, and by the time she'd saved enough to get a better place, they were serious enough to move in together. So, instead, my sister started paying half the bills/groceries, and used her savings to pay our mum back, even though she didn't request she do so. \n\nShe was a single mum for 2 years, struggling financially, while working, first at a job she hated then as a probationary police officer. She managed just fine because she accepted the help that was offered to her and didn't impose on anybody.\n\nYour friend has been offered a deal like what my sister had - move back in with mum until you get yourself sorted. It's not a forever deal, she can move out again as soon as she can afford a place to live and all the costs that go with that, on top of baby costs. It's a much better idea than trying to force a currently ill friend to help them out. This isn't just a living arrangements thing, it's financial and babysitting support, as well. That's a lot to take on for a kid that isn't related to you, especially when you have health issues to deal with. \n\nYou warned her about being a single mum. She chose to keep the baby.

That's fine, you've done a lot for her already. She's not your responsibility, and nor is her child.\n\nIf you're really worried, though, call her mum and let her know what's going on. The only thing you can do is pass on information of the situation to someone in a position to help.

I raised a baby as a single mom, and let me tell you that it does not get easier until they go to school. So until she can get the child into something at least several hours a day so she can work... She's not going to be able to move out! Now I don't know what your country and situation is like, I'm guessing it's not the US since you said you own an apartment (here when you can buy them they're called condos) so I'm not sure what age a child would be eligible for daycare that she can afford... But you might be looking at 6 years!\n\nUntil that kid can be gone all day so she can work she's not going to be able to get a job without a full-time babysitter and you don't want to do that (and it's not your responsibility) So the only option is to say no to her moving in! And the thing is, she's got this weird I can live with you for free but I can't live with my mom for free thing? Which is ridiculous!

Her parents, who are already financially supporting her, have invited her to live with them; presumably this would allow the money they give her to go much further, and they could help out in the same way she wants you to do if they were willing. She just doesn't want to move in with her parents, but she *can*, and as a parent now, *she* should make that sacrifice to give Mia more stability. She wants you to sacrifice your living conditions and mental health for her child because she won't sacrifice *her* desired living conditions and move in with her parents, simply because she doesn't want to. \n\n3) You have to put on your own oxygen mask first, and you are *right* to. Laura certainly isn't going to be a good friend in the way she expects you to--she's not putting you first, and again, she has another stable offer of free housing from her parents--she and her child won't be on the street, and there's no indication here that her parents are abusive or unkind or detrimental to her mental health--she just doesn't think an adult with her own child \"should\" live with her parents. You deserve a peaceful place to recuperate and work through your diagnosis, to establish coping mechanisms, and get a stable baseline in place for yourself. Also--would it be healthy for Mia OR for you to be in an environment where you're battling a new and significant diagnosis and feel mentally and emotionally unstable and at the end of your rope? Not that I'm suggesting any kind of risk to the baby, just that it sounds like there would be a lot of stress and conflict if they moved in, which would not be a good environment for you *or* for a baby. And again, you're the only one who would be working---what if their presence worsened your mental health and you weren't able to work? Then you'd have nowhere to live, and Laura could go live with her parents, as she should do now. \n\n4) She's right--you don't know what it is to be a mother. *Because you aren't a mother*. She chose to become a mom, and is trying to guilt you into being responsible for her decision-- so that she doesn't have to \"sacrifice\" and move in with her parents (I put that in quotes because a lot of people who are struggling would love the option to move in with parents who are financially stable enough to give them a monthly allowance, and probably own their own home and won't charge rent). \n\nIt really sucks that she is having such a hard time!
