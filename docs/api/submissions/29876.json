You were being kind enough by offering them a place to stay!", "NTA, and I get you are helping your friends who are unwell, but I\u2019d say no full stop to these strangers, as there will only be another thing. If they come with kids, I can guarantee you and your partner will be altering what you do to accommodate them. It\u2019s just the start of things this", "They knew what they were doing \ud83d\ude02. Made you agree to host them and then put you on the spot with the dogs. So you end up having to revoke the invite & have anxiety/ keep second guessing about being an AH. The mind games people play, my God! No dogs allowed, periodT.", "I\u2019m a little unclear why you are helping out in this capacity at all. I get that they would want their dogs with them, it\u2019s best if they find some other accommodation. I would never stay with anyone unless they were my super close friends. NTA but I feel like you are overly nice for putting yourself out there and maybe need to say no more", "You would be an AH if you *didn't* ask (tell) them to leave the dogs elsewhere. You have a responsibility to your senior cats not to cause them avoidable trauma. That is where your priority should be, to care for those animals dependent on you. Full stop. Good luck.", "NTA. Your house. Your cats\u2019 house. They need to feel safe in their space. Apologise that the dogs can\u2019t come.", "Tell them no and recommend Rover.", "NTA. Tell them the dogs can\u2019t come.", "It is okay to say the dogs are not welcome.  Merely reply that unfortunately you do not allow dogs in the house.  If you want, send them a list of a few boarding places near you when you tell them.   You do not have to allow visitors to bring their dogs and you don\u2019t have to explain why.   Don\u2019t feel bad about your decision, don\u2019t explain it, and if they want to argue, calmly reply that you are happy to offer the humans a free place to stay while they are visiting their relatives, but you are not allowing the dogs.\n\nI don\u2019t  allow dogs in my house.  Not even my children\u2019s dogs. Yes, that means when one of them visits from out of town, if he brings the dogs, he sleeps at his in-laws house not mine.  If he pays the dog sitter and is coming to visit me, I split the cost with him.  My choice.", "NTA. Bring dogs=find somewhere else to stay. Non-negotiable.", "INFO: Do the dogs live with a cat/are they cat trained?

Holidays are stressful enough, you\u2019re kind to do so .\n\n\nNot everyone likes dogs/wants them in their home.", "NTA\n\n'No dogs' is a completely reasonable condition to put on hosting someone - you are already doing them a massive favour as it is, you shouldn't have to further risk the well-being of your animals and household to suit their every need.\n\nYes, this will mean they will need to find accomodation for said dogs - a friend at home, paying for a sitter, or worst case finding alternative accomodation, but that is just the reality of having pet dogs.", "NTA. Just tell them you\u2019re happy to help but bringing dogs won\u2019t work. This is really something they should\u2019ve been more upfront about & if that means they need to find somewhere else to stay, then that\u2019s for them to sort out", "NTA\n\nHi I'm afraid you cannot bring the dogs to our house with you. We have elderly cats who would not cope with dogs in the house. \n\nTell them asap.", "NTA. It is your cat\u2019s home too, and they shouldn\u2019t be made to feel unsafe for the convenience of your acquaintances. They\u2019re already saving money from not staying at a hotel, so they should be able to afford to board the dogs. If they can\u2019t afford their own hotel, and can\u2019t afford to kennel their pets, they can\u2019t afford to go visiting. We all make choices in life. I have several cats and that is always a factor in planning any travel - even a day trip.", "NTA, it sounds like they didn't ask you if they can bring the dogs & are only now even mentioning it. They should be asking you 1st & not assuming it's ok, it is just rude of them to assume you will be ok with 2 dogs coming in to your house. Call them & say the dogs can not come & stay at the house. You need to think about your own animals & bringing strange dogs into their territory for a long period of time is not fair on your pets & will stress them out, not to mention, do you even want dogs in your house.", "NTA.\n\nTell them no dogs or they have to find somewhere else to stay. It\u2019s rude af to just assume you can bring your dogs anywhere with you, no matter how small they are.", "NTA\n\nIf they're this entitled *before* they arrive, I expect them to be a nightmare when they're actually at your place.\n\nAbsolutely have that chat with them. Tell them no. If they don't accept this, they're taking advantage of you.", "NTA, if they can't afford to travel with the dogs or find someone to care for the dogs then they can't afford to travel. You can't afford to risk the health and happiness of your senior cats. I have a cat who is getting old who hasn't been around dogs, I wouldn't be able to house some strange dogs even though I absolutely love dogs and dogs generally love me. It is no different than if you had small children and their dogs were potentially bad around kids, you just aren't able to do it.", "Nta. If they want to bring their animals they can book a hotel that allows dogs. You are already giving them a free place to stay, if they complain about your terms they are assholes and can just go somewhere else.", "No no no they are taking advantage. You have to look after your pets. Speak up now NTA", "NTA first off it's not \"understandable\" that you would give up 2 rooms of your house to host acquaintances who you aren't even friends with. Why the hell would you do that? It is however understandable that someone who would impose themselves and their kids on someone they barely know would also be entitled enough to bring their dogs without asking. An easy solution is to grow a spine and tell these people they need to find somewhere else to stay. You shouldn't be going out of your way to accommodate people you barely know and who already are being disrespectful of you and your home.", "NTA.  If the acquaintances decide to bring their dogs anyway, be prepared to enforce your boundary. \n\nDogs stay with family while acquaintances stay with you, or they can all stay elsewhere.", "Contact them immediately, and let them know you absolutely cannot accommodate their dogs. Be firm, it's not a negotiation. Let them know the dogs are an absolute deal breaker; they cannot stay at your home. You're sorry, but your cats' safety and comfort have to come before visiting dogs. Tell the would-be visitors that this is final: no dogs.\n\nYou're NTA to prioritize your own family: your cats.", "NTA. you dont bring dogs if you crash somewhere else. weird behaviour NTA", "There's no way in hell I would give up 2 bedrooms in my house for people I barely know, much less let them bring their dogs.  Just to save them money?  Hell no!", "NTA. You\u2019re already going above and beyond. It\u2019s exceptionally entitled for them to assume they can bring pets with them. It makes me wonder what the friend you\u2019re helping is saying to them. It sounds like you\u2019re being taken advantage of here.", "NTA you don\u2019t just bring dogs into someone else\u2019s home without asking that\u2019s a huge inconvenience even without your cats", "You don't ask them not to bring their dogs. You TELL them it's just not possible.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nSince they didn't mention the dogs in advance of your agreement that they stay with you, you absolutely would not be the AH to reply, \"Your dogs can't come. We can't accommodate them.\"\n\nYou agreed to the people staying, and you've done a lot for their family. That does not mean they are entitled to bring pets without asking, or that an invitation to humans is extended to dogs. Many people have pets of their own, many people have allergies. What if you had a kid who was deathly allergic? You'd be saying something then, for sure.", "NTA my friend moved into MY house with her dog. I have 2 oldish cats. She completely understands we need boundaries with closed doors and her dog is outside through the day. \n\nYou need to advocate for your animals because they can't!", "NTA.  Shut it down now or your life will be hell.", "Nta tell them no, the dogs can\u2019t stay and that they will need to find other accommodations if they cannot leave the dogs at home. I\u2019m getting door mat vibes. There is nothing wrong with telling people no. Your the AH if you leave it to the last minute or get wishy washy with your no and then wanna complain when they don\u2019t listen to you.", "NTA, I find it pretty presumptuous of them to not ask if you were okay with someone bringing dogs to your house. I believe that there should be some level of courtesy here with asking permission. I always ask if I\u2019m allow d to bring my dog before just assuming yes", "NTA. You are doing them a favour. They will have to ask a neighbour or friend to watch their dogs, as they can't come with.", "NTA. Dogs aren't allowed in our home because we also have senior, frail cats and frankly someone toting their dog around like a fashion accessory doesn't Trump my cats' well being... especially in their own home!", "NTA.  Don't ask them, TELL them their dogs aren't welcome in your house.", "NTA but tell them NOW so they can make other arrangements. And BE FIRM. They will try to push, but you need to protect your cats.

I agree on suggesting they stay elsewhere. NTA", "Seriously, cannot stand a lot of dog owners because of shit like this.", "Lol I take offense to this . I have owned dogs my whole life and own two now.  If I go somewhere and my dogs can't go or if I just think it's easier for them  not to go , I have no problem boarding them or using rover! It's just that easy.", "I know service dogs are brilliant and consummate professionals but I can't imagine a service dog would even be happy being around other animals that are on edge. I'm pretty sure the dog senses stress better than I could and I haven't ever been worried that the extremely stressed cats may attack me. (Well, okay, I have played too rough with a cat or misjudged the level of interaction desired, but even the smartest dog isn't going to have the sort of experience on judging cat behavior that a human can have, and a pet or working animal does not have the same capability to soothe or make friends with another animal that a person has)", "Exactly, one of the texts back-and-forth with my partner they were talking about taking an elderly family member back with them to where they live for treatment, and in the body of mentioning that text they said, \u201cnot sure if we can pull that off because we\u2019ll have the two of us, the kid, and the two dogs with us.\u201dHonestly, I was pretty stunned because in general they\u2019re really reasonable and upfront people.  I\u2019ve had this happen once before and the whole situation was a circus, and the cats were pretty traumatized.", "Ah, leave out the decor. \"Sorry, you can't bring the dogs.\" is just fine.", "NTA-tell them you can't have the dogs at your place and suggest they leave the dogs at home or have the family they're visiting keep them.", "Stolen comment.

I was thinking out loud about what to do with my dog. Until the very end of last year my youngest daughter lived with me so it was easy to just go as she would\u2019ve taken care of the dog. \n\nMy sister immediately suggested we bring the dog. She has a friendly dog and fenced in yard. \n\nWe were planning to do just that when we unexpectedly got a puppy and decided that was too much to travel with and the puppy was too young so maybe next year and we\u2019d probably board the dogs.", "Tks, I guess I just don\u2019t understand traveling with pets.
