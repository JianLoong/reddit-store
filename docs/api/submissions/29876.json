I would never bring my dog with me unless they gave full permission first or offered and only if I knew they were good with my dog (as in close friend or family). Even then it's completely OK with me when people say no.  Most of the time, my dog has a blast playing at his boarding place anyways (they spoil him rotten and he gets free reign as it's cage free with a doggie dorm).", "Of course you are NTA for not allowing strange dogs in your home. How rude to think they could bring them without thinking to ask. I would tell them your own pets must come first and you will understand if they stay elsewhere.", "You sound like an incredibly kind person. Having extra people over holidays as a favor in the first place is huge, there is no way adding their dogs to the mix is just acceptable. NTA, more like saint.", "NTA No dogs! Tell them you have senior cats and cannot accommodate the dogs. \n\nMy sister tried it for a friend. Her cats became territorial while the dogs were there and after they left. She ended up rehoming one of them and installing baby gates to keep the other two apart.", "NTA, they can board the dogs.  You are saving them a lot of money already.", "NTA.  If you let them dictate this, who knows what they will dictate to you while they stay in your home.  You never bring a pet with you to someone else's home without asking.  The least they can do is put their dogs up while they are visiting.  They are saving enough on a hotel to afford that.  If they can't afford, then they shouldn't be taking such a long vacation.", "NTA\n\n\nTo begin with: \nHow rude if them to inform you that they are bringing dogs!\n\nAnd:\nTotally unfair to you and your pets.\n\nNo way.", "NTA.  You are already doing them a huge favor by allowing them to stay.  It\u2019s rude of them just to assume you are ok with dogs in your house rather than asking for permission", "Was at an up-scale, crowded hotel in a mid-sized city this weekend. Someone had an XL Great Dane support dog.  Not a service dog. The dog was suspicious of everyone who walked toward the owner. Saw it lunge at least one person.", "You must be kidding. 100% NTA. These people are acquaintances at best and you're doing them a HUGE favor, They come, they don't bring their dogs. If they do, they get a hotel. Your family comes first.", "Service dogs provide a service their owner and can be restricted in personal property.   Therapy animals provide support to groups of people.   They visit nursing homes, hospitals etc.  emotional support animals provide emotional support to their owner they are not trained to provide a service.   ADA only covers emotional support animals in chances of housing.   An emotional support anima is not a service animal.   And a private home owner is not under any obligation to have an animal of any type in there home", "Not even if the dog is a trained service dog.  It is a private home, and the owners of the home do not want dogs in the home.", "I have zero problem with people traveling with pets.  None, nada, zilch.\n\n*As long as they fucking ask first and don't just assume.*", "These people's entitlement has nothing to do with owning dogs, this is just the type of person they are. The most entitled people on the planet are actually wealthy people, tax evaders, con artists, scammers etc. People who own dogs are mostly just regular people.", "Wow. To think any guest pet trumps the resident pet is just nuts to me. And honestly, the idea of taking a pet when visiting somebody else is kind of nuts to me, too.\n\nI grew up with a house full of dogs, and I think the only time we brought along one of them was when we had a puppy with health issues. We brought him along when we went on a day-long visit to my grandparents, but he was so teeny that he was being held or in his bed the whole time. And we checked ahead of time anyway--they had no pets at all.", "I honestly don\u2019t understand why you haven\u2019t already asked \u201coh? Where are the dogs staying, because obviously we can\u2019t accommodate them here under any circumstances\u201d. It\u2019s your house, not theirs, right?", "I mean. I think there are contexts where it is perfectly acceptable to ASK if your dog is welcome, as long as you ask politely and are ok with whatever answer you get, and as long as you consider the situation before asking. My sister has lots of animals, including a dog, and we sometimes bring our dog over too. We live a bit of a drive away, so if we don't bring him we'd need to make other arrangements for him. I always ask first and it's not a problem that I do so. In a similar situation I would never be offended if someone asked. However, I certainly would never ask a new acquaintance or someone I knew didn't like dogs or had incompatible pets, or just assume that I could bring my dog in a houseguest situation.", "NTA\n\nAs everyone has said, NTA..\n\nBut. You gotta raise this ASAP, delay is your enemy. Every moment you leave it is another opportunity later for them to be like \"oh it's too late, you never told us, we don't have TIME to rearrange things NOW\". \n\nSo raise it ASAP, that gives the longest lead time, i.e.less reason for them to make excuses later. \n\nSecond, you tell them on a phone call so they can't deny it later \"I didn't see your message\", \"I didn't see your email\" or however you let them know. If you have a spouse or someone with you, record the phone call with an app, so you can play it for them later(dick move, but they may start trying to rally people against you later and when you're receiving messages, posts on social media and getting calls, you can just \"bow out\" play the recording of them plainly agreeing not to bring dogs weeks in advance and wash your hands of it) \n\nYou follow that call up with a message, this is also key. \"Hey John and Mary, thanks for being so understanding that we have cats and cannot accommodate your dogs while your family stays here. We appreciate you making other arrangements and not bringing your dogs as we discussed\" \n\nCoz how do they send screenshots of conversations later when that gem is sitting in their inbox later and you can send it to others(when they start the entitled garbage rallying people against you). You send the screenshot of you saying it to them that you had a conversation, they agreed and it was about not bringing the dogs. Nail in their moral high ground coffin. \n\nI say this based on entitled family in the past and having to go to lengths to \"protect\" myself, i.e. just make sure things were crystal clear, to show others later that things were dealt with. People like that, rely on your good will not to spill the beans, to work with your bending on bad circumstances(which they plan into happening coz it simply suits them). \n\nBut when you can show they tried to use you to their peers and you ask those people \"what would you do? I said I couldn't take the dogs, I told em I couldn't, I told em to plan weeks in advance that I couldn't, they agreed they wouldn't. They turned up with the dogs and I had to send them away to sort out their own place to stay at their expense\" \n\nAnd that's what you do. If they turn up with dogs. Tell em they can't stay anymore. It's 100% reasonable not to be used and circumvented and then your one boundary broken intentionally. It would show zero respect or appreciation for you and the help you were freely giving. \n\nSpeed. Ensure they hear what you say. Ensure its written and clear after the fact. Hold to your decision. 100% perfectly reasonable.", "Oh maybe many of the cat owners would do that if the cats would comply., lol.", "Cat owners are no better but at least we're generally not trying to take them places \ud83d\ude06", "I can only speak for my area, but owners of unsupervised outdoor cats are pretty shamed here. Indoor cats are far more the norm except for barn cats in the more rural areas.", "Yes, this. Hosts are lucky cats don't like to travel. They don't want to stay at your house, they want to stay at their house.", "(shudders at horrible memories)"]}
