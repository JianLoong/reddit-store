I have all 4 of them from 8:30 in the morning until 4 in the afternoon. They each pay me $200 per kid per week and they bring their own food. Elizabeth goes to preschool in the mornings. \n\nWe play at the house in the mornings, walk to Elizabeth\u2019s school at 11, play in the park next to the school for a half hour, come home and eat lunch, then everyone naps from 12:30-2. We have 5 nap mats in the play area. Everyone has a mat and everyone has a sleeping bag. We read a story, I torn off the lights and shut the blinds, turn on the lullaby music, and use that time to start cleaning up. \n\nNow, I have a rule: if you do not want to nap, you don\u2019t have to but you don\u2019t get to get up and play. You either sleep, read, or play quietly on your mat until 2. \n\nMy older nephew has really been pushing back on this. He gets up every time I turn around and tries to be as loud as possible while on his mat. I told my brother and SIL about this and they said he doesn\u2019t like naps and to let him play. I refused because if they think they can choose between napping and playing, none of them will nap plus he\u2019ll wake up the other kids. \n\nThey\u2019re saying I\u2019m being unfair by forcing him to stay on his mat for the entire 1.5 hours and that it\u2019s not developmentally appropriate. I\u2019m considering telling them to find someone else to watch him because of this.

You likely need that time to be able to clean up after them as you don\u2019t get that time to do so while they are up as there are 5 of them.\n\nEvery daycare and preschool that I have ever interacted with have the same rule as you do, that naptime occurs every day at a set time and that the kids don\u2019t technically have to sleep but do need to lay there quietly or read or play quietly.\n\nYou are right on the money that if they are given the choice none of them will nap at all.\n\nIf the parents don\u2019t like it they can find other arrangements for their kid.", "I grew up with that rule. GP suggested it to parent. Staying in bed still rest and helped household harmony. A sleep deprived or pressurised parent (or carer) is a stressed parent. \n\nYou could however start letting oldest help you with tidying up. He is at that age where it might be viewed as fun.\n\nAnd if he was at nursery, they have similar rules about quiet time. So moving him away from you just means they pay more for same treatment.", "I struggled with this when my kid was that age. She couldn\u2019t nap and had to sit for 90 mins while the other kids napped. It sucked for her but I also understood that the childcare centre couldn\u2019t cater to her. I find a different place inside a home daycare where she was allowed to quietly play, watch a bit of a show, and do activities independently while the home childcare worker cleaned up. It worked for everyone thankfully (and she stayed quiet and wasn\u2019t disruptive).", "NTA and I can see why with 5 young children to mind you need structure, Some 4 year olds have outgrown naps and staying on a map and quiet for 1.5 hours is a very long time for a 4 yr old. You may need to decide if the situation still works with so many kids at different development stages to cater for. Could you bring him out to a different area in the house to play quietly or watch a tv show with headphones for that time period?", "Daycares and Pre-K have nap/quiet time. \n\nNAH", "NTA. If the 4 year old has outgrown naps, he\u2019s probably outgrown the type of care you can provide. They can send him to preschool.", "NTA.  My daughter\u2019s Montessori school did the exact same thing as you.  The kids fell into line fairly quickly with staying on the mats because there were no exceptions.", "NAH\n\nLet him go into another room to have \"quiet time.\" If he misbehaves, then tell his parents that they need to find another sitter. \n\nHe's only 4 years old. He should be able to follow directions and be relatively quiet when he's supposed to. Giving in to him only teaches him that if he doesn't want to do something, all he has to do is put up a fuss and he wins! He gets his way! That's setting him up for trouble ahead, creating the proverbial \"monster\" that no one wants to babysit, play with or be around.", "YTA\n\nThat's a damn long nap for children that age. I'm surprised that those kids aren't bouncing off the walls when they're supposed to be going to bed. \n\nExpecting a four year old to stare at the ceiling for an hour and a half or be silent for that amount of time is unreasonable. He needs more stimulation than that. It **is** developmentally inappropriate. \n\nIf you still need your hour and a half of free time, do this kid a favor and tell his parents you no longer want to watch their children. Don't blame it on the kid, **you** are the one being unreasonable.", "NTA...\n\nRegardless of the setting, you are doing what you have to do to maintain a routine. Those kids are going to have to follow a routine anywhere they do so this is not really unreasonable.\n\nThe benefits for all of you are priceless.. piece of mind for the parents and you get time with your nieces and nephews.\n\nOn the flip side, you are providing a service with a very reasonable price point. And when providing that service, you need the daily routine to run smoothly. \n\nNow maybe implementing something along the lines of letting your nephew sleep or rest for an hour, then come out to help you strengthen up or help with the afternoon snack could help with his desire to get up and move. Maybe as the preschool your daughter goes to for ideas how to deal with this. \n\nGood luck! I hope this goes well!", "An hour and a half is a long time for a 4 year old. I understand why you do it, but it just doesn't work for him. He needs something else to keep him quiet and occupied.", "ESH 4 is old enough not to need a nap and too young to be expected to have independent, still, quiet time for 1.5 hours. \n\nThere is a compromise here. Usually in pk4 they are allowed up sooner to do quiet activities at a table. You are not going to be able to force a four year old to lay down and read for 1.5 hours... be real. Make him lay down for 20 minutes until everyone else is good and asleep and then give him a coloring book and let him sit at the table. \n\nWhen you have mixed age groups, you can't always keep everything the same for everyone. If you had 5 four year olds, you wouldn't be having such a long quiet/nap time. You have to remember 5 year olds go to kinder 7 hours a day with no nap.\n\nIf you aren't willing to adjust your schedule to accommodate the fact that you have both preschoolers and toddlers, then you should tell them to have someone else watch him.", "NTA. If they would prefer to find other childcare arrangements they are welcome to. 5 kids is a lot and if the oldest start challenging you it\u2019s gonna be nuts. Tell them they either tell him to follow the rules of the house he is at or you will no longer watch him.", "NTA - it\u2019s the exact same rule at a daycare/preschool.", "I understand your reasoning and you\u2019re entitled to have any rules you want for your house. \n\nI just want to mention that 1.5 hours is a very long time for a 4 year old to have to sit still while awake. My 4-year-old son\u2019s preschool still has rest time, but it\u2019s for 20 minutes only. If they fall asleep they can stay asleep as long as they\u2019d like, but the rest of the kids can get up after 20 minutes because anything longer than that is too long for them to be confined to their mats. I agree with another comment that it might be best to try to find a way he can help you clean up or play quietly elsewhere off the mat.\n\nI\u2019d say NAH. Your house, your rules. But also parents should always be allowed to advocate for their children in childcare situations, so long as your brother and SIL were respectful in their approach.", "NTA. You might suggest he go to preschool with your 4 year old.", "You have your set rules. Rules which are necessary for managing multiple kids alone. If he won\u2019t follow them they can find new childcare. \n\nWhat is ideal developmentaly is rarely what works in a group setting.", "YTA, it isn't unusual for kids to start dropping their nap as they move through the toddler to pre-school age.", "NAH\n\nMy kid absolutely could not nap after age 2 and expecting him to stay on a mat for 90 minutes would have been torture for him.  He's an adult now and I still wouldn't subject him to something like this -- it simply isn't possible for him. It may be impossible for this kid, too. \n\nOn the other hand, five kids is a lot to handle, you're not a trained early childhood educator, and it seems clear that you need a mid-day break in order to manage your well being.  If you cannot handle this child's needs, then his parents need to fully accept this and find alternate care.", "NTA. Your rules are the same as any other daycare or pre-k. If the parents don\u2019t like it then I guess one of them has to quit their jobs and stay home or hire a private nanny.", "YTA. My 4 year old goes to all day pre school and they only have 60 min nap/quiet time. If they don\u2019t sleep because they have too much energy, they\u2019re taken to the gym for 15 mins and then back for another shot at some rest. Plus, what\u2019s the difference from his cot to the floor? Quiet time is quiet time, so I would understand staying in the room but confining these kids to a closet sized space for that amount of time when they are already refusing to utilize it for its intended purpose *is* developmentally inappropriate. They\u2019re kids, not dogs.", "YTA. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s reasonable to expect a 4 yr old to be quiet for 90 minutes.", "NTA.  If they think you're being so unfair, it's time for them to find alternate child care.", "NTA - he is allowed to quietly read if he isn\u2019t tired", "NTA. It is appropriate. I used to have almost the same rules in a daycare I worked for. They each got to choose a quiet toy, and not touch their neighbor.", "It\u2019s LITERALLY what daycares do. Tell them find someone else if they don\u2019t like how you handle all their damn kids for basically slave wages. NTA", "NAH - But you need to change your expectations. My kids stopped napping entirely before the age of 4 and expecting a kid at that age to stay in one place awake and quiet for 90 min is delusional at best. \n\nPut him in a different room with quiet activities or have him help you clean. There are work arounds here,  but you really have to tailor what you do for each kid. It's not what all daycares do, but it is what the good ones do. And you want to be a good one for your family. Or maybe you don't, and it's time to find different arrangements.", "NTA \n\nBut. 1.5 hrs seems  a little long. \nI would make it about 45 minutes.\n\nThen give the kids that are awake a quiet project, like coloring or play dough time. \nUntil the rest of the children wake up.", "NTA in any way. Sounds like you got it set up really nice. I\u2019d be delighted to send my children to you.    \n\nYou\u2019re not being unfair. In fact, you\u2019re teaching the children to be respectful of other people\u2019s shared spaces.", "INFO: how dark is the room? You say he can read or play quietly on his mat but also that the blinds are closed and lights are off. Is there enough light that he can play? Is there enough light for him to read without straining his eyes?", "My youngest had the same issue at 3, 4 and In kindergarten. Rarely would she sleep.  Looking back I think it was anxiety. Just sayin", "My daughters are young adults and still refer to afternoons as \"quiet-do-your-own-thing-time\". NTA", "Let them find a new day care, your rules are your rules. If they want new rules let them pay a day care, NTA", "NTA.  But at 4 he\u2019s outgrowing the need for naps like the other kids.  He\u2019s going to need some other arrangement soon.  Can he not go to nursery with your daughter?", "NAH personally, I would think an hour and a half nap every day is a little excessive for a four year old, especially if he\u2019s having trouble sitting still (when my kids with ADHD were toddlers, naps were always a struggle.) However, lots of preschools will have 1-2 hours for quiet time or napping, like you do, and it is likely that the younger ones especially need that time. Ultimately, I think you could compromise and make this work if everyone is willing, but if no one will budge, they might need to find someone else to watch him. Unfortunately, I expect they\u2019ll be far less likely to get a compromise if he goes to a proper daycare or preschool.", "NTA.  The reality is, if he were in full time care somewhere he'd have to do the same and most likely longer (many many places have a 2 hour nap time).  Some places have the facility to offer to let non-nappers have somewhere else to go once the nappers are asleep.  I might suggest that you start thinking about this if you plan on continuing care for them next year, since a lot of late 4s/5s do end up giving up nap, and it can be less stressful if there's an area where they can do quiet play/read books, after resting their bodies for 30-60 minutes.  When I've done nap times while caring for kids, I often have the first part be a 'bed time story' with music/meditation made for kids that naturally segways into music.  If a child isn't asleep by the 1 hour period and they don't seem like they're going to, they may go to an area of the room away from nappers where there are books, coloring supplies, headphones and books on audio that are ONLY available during that time, ect.\n\nAnd yes, if they don't like your schedule, they should find another care provider.  With group care, the parents don't actually make all the decisions, other than whether or not they continue.  They're not going to beat $400/week for full time daycare, and they're not hiring a nanny for that rate either.", "Nta. If they don't like the service you're providing they can leave their kids somewhere else.  Commercial providers would likely have similar routines anyway.   I get that some kids outgrow naps early but quiet time is important anyway.", "NTA. We have quiet time during camp with *7-11* year olds. Although we say you can read or do something that doesnt make any noice as well. \nA 4yo cant read ofc, but maybe he can have a quiet toy, so he doesnt have to sleep.", "When I was in kindergarten, we had to lay on mats for 45 minutes each day.  I was never a napper - even in preschool, but we didn\u2019t get to opt out of napping because we didn\u2019t want to.  We had to lay on our mat quietly whether we chose to sleep there or not.", "NTA. I've worked in a daycare for kids three and under. They all do this", "NTA.  They need to tell their kid that he has to obey or they need to  find a day care that can accommodate them", "NTA. my children went to Montessori, and if students, aged 3-5, stayed from 8:30-3:15, there was naptime after lunch. If they were older, they could go in another room and read. No choices. You're doing a great job.", "NAH, However...My son (4) is no longer a napper and hasn't been for a while. His last daycare forced him to stay on his mat and he got in trouble every day for failing to lay down or stay quiet. We switched daycares a month ago and they do not require naps. They let the ones who want to nap do so and the others play quietly nearby...all in the same room.his first day there he got a sticker for being good during quiet time.\n\nI know it's tough with just you, but this will continue to be a problem if you try to force this. He will continue to get up and keep the others awake. Give him something to do quietly.", "Only 200$ per week? My niece pays 700$ per week. \ud83d\ude33\ud83e\udee3", "NTA.

It would be one thing if he could do quiet time, but if he can\u2019t and he disrupts the others who still need naps it becomes untenable.", "NTA. This is exactly how it works at daycares as well. My kid is 5 and only naps about half the time and the other half he sits or lays quietly on his mat to allow the other kids to sleep.", "My 4 year old is in pre k and they have nap time there. She tells me sometimes she doesn't sleep but she's a good girl and lays there quietly lol nta", "NTA. I think that\u2019s a universal thing. I had that at my daycare and my grandma who had 13 did that with all of her under school age kids. Very appropriate.", "ESH - you have set expectations that need to be followed. He may be outgrowing naps, however should still be able to follow expectations as would be expected in school. The parents' suggestion of just letting him play teaches him he doesn't have to follow expectations even when given other viable options. Give him the option of helping you while the other kids nap or give him a separate space where he can play quietly. If that doesn't work, the parents need to reinforce those expectations or make other arrangements. This would be the same at any childcare facility. Is he too young for TK?", "Soft YTA by 4 my son had completely grown out of napping. Forcing him to be still on a mat for 1.5 hours is a lot to expect from a 4 year old. You may have to adjust your expectations and create a back up plan for him. \n\nAlso unneeded napping can cause problems at bed time.", "YTA. \n\nMost kids drop their nap well before 4. Only a few will keep it to that age. You're not being reasonable. He shouldn't even be trying to nap. Your oldest nephew is the same age as your own child yet she isn't going down for a nap after 11, she is going to daycare or pre-school. Where it sounds like *she* isn't required to nap.\n\nAll these people are commenting on daycare rules when you are *not* a daycare and can actually cater better to the needs of an individual child because you have half as many under your care. All you're (emphasis - you are doing this, not the child, by having him in the nap room) doing is ruining nap time for the children who need it by leaving a disruptive and alert child in the same room. You can give him quiet time in a different room or have him help clean up.\n\nMaybe it's because I'm from a different country but even daycare here understand that different kids have different needs and if the child has dropped their nap, they've dropped their nap. Their bedtimes will reflect their sleep needs.\n\nYou're only doing this because you don't want to deal with him for that amount of time. You want a break. But that's not how childcare works. Especially when you don't have another worker to cover you.", "NTA.\n\n\nYour itinerary is perfectly reasonable.  If the problem nephew  won't sleep, give him an age appropriate book and have him read quietly.  If his parents don't like it and he has to be disruptive, It's time for his parents to find another daycare option.\n\n\nYOU are in control of this situation.  Assert yourself with the parents.", "NTA kids need discipline and rules. If you give in it will be a circus. Tell them fine you will watch him two more weeks which should be time enough for them to make other arrangements.", "NTA\n\nYou are not being unreasonable. I guess they can just stay home and watch their own kid. \ud83e\udd37", "What do your siblings expect when they leave their kids in daycare? You are creating a routine. Something I am pretty sure they would be grateful for when you stop being their nanny. Oh to be a kid and get 1.5 hours nap! NTA", "NTA my 2 yr old is hating on naps, and even the maternal health nurse said if he's not napping, he needs at least an hour of quiet time to rest and recharge his body.\nKids need downtime. And by having a set time, it helps build structure and routine. If the kids were in daycare, it'd be the same deal", "Please I worked daycare (preschool age 3-5) for almost 8 years. Nap time was 12:30-2:30 everyday. If a child woke up early or couldn\u2019t go to sleep it wasn\u2019t forced but they had to stay on their cot (unless going to the bathroom) and do something quiet, usually looking at books.", "Soft YTA. Your expectations aren\u2019t realistic. It may be possible for some 4 year olds to nap, but others have outgrown it. If your nephew truly isn\u2019t tired, he won\u2019t be able to sleep. That means he\u2019s expected to be still, quiet, and entertain himself for 90 minutes straight, which isn\u2019t developmentally appropriate and you\u2019re setting him up to fail. If you can\u2019t continue to watch him now that he\u2019s not napping, that\u2019s reasonable and his parents will need to find somewhere else that doesn\u2019t require a 90 minute nap.", "NTA.  It is developmentally appropriate for a four year old to nap.  He's pushing back because, developmentally he's at a stage where kids normally test boundaries.

What you are doing is reasonable.", "NTA. \n\nAnd your house your rules.", "NTA.

Maybe if he doesn't want to listen and sit and read quietly on his mat, then make him sit in the corner instead since he can't behave. Usually works", "NAH- Obviously every child is going to be different. The real issue here seems to be either his lack of discipline or your lack of compromise. Maybe have him in a different room completely if you\u2019re able to. The rule about playing quietly is still something he is capable of, even if it\u2019s not on a mat. Maybe you can help mitigate the issue by allowing him to watch a movie. Most classic Disney move are usually 90 minutes long. Maybe letting him watch a movie in another room will help keep him quiet and keep your schedule in tact. There are other solutions you could think of. But keeping it so strict will only make things more difficult for you in the long run.", "YTA.  The naps don't seem to be for the kids.  After age 2 many kids don't need a nap.  Naps can, in fact, prevent them from getting the sleep they need at night.  So I'm not surprised the 4 year old isn't cooperating with a nap he doesn't need.  The difference in what a 2 and 4 year old need is very different in some areas.  Stop trying to treat them all the same.  Also 1 1/2 hours seems really long for the older two.", "[deleted]", "YTA because you are complaining when the parents are right. It is not developmentally appropriate (In general, all kids are different) for a 4 year old to have a 90 minute nap. Most daycares and licensed facilities only do 45 minutes to an hour of quiet time. It is also not reasonable for a 4 year old to be forced into quiet for 90 minutes. He is pushing back because this is not what his body or mind needs. \n\nAs someone else said, you can have him do something else in a different room.

Not what is best for only the youngest of the children.", "[deleted]", "Kinda YTA.\n\n>it\u2019s not developmentally appropriate\nIt's not. there is a reason that day care has kids of different ages in different groups following different routines. You need to be willing to provide a routine that works for all age groups or have their parents make other arrangemnts if that doesn't work for you or you  aren't willing to do it.\n\nI see that your kid is 4, and the oldest nephew is too. One reason your kid might be napping and nephew isn't is because she has the mental stimulation of  nursery/school, and he doesn't. \n\nAllow him out of the play room and have him sit and do 2 activities during the \"nap time\" quiet activities like reading and colouring etc, put together some busy boxes.  This might be a good time to work with him on 4 year old skills, in prep for school (the things that he isn't getting because he doesn't attend organised daycare).\n\nYou seem to be forcing it because you want alone time.

They\u2019re right, it isn\u2019t developmentally appropriate to make a kid who is outgrowing naps to sit quietly for 90 minutes. However, I think this is more of a symptom of the fact that you are watching too many small children at once - 5 kids between 2-4 is a lot for one person. I think it would be best for everyone if they found different arrangements.", "YTA, very lightly. I think you\u2019re absolutely doing your best. At four though children may decline to nap.

I have 2 kids in daycare (3f, 2m) and my son still naps but my daughter doesn\u2019t. For the time he\u2019s napping she lays on her cot and relaxes (listens to the music or can look at picture books/play with her tablet on silent) when he wakes up she can get up too.

Elizabeth goes to preschool in the mornings. \n\nWe play at the house in the mornings, walk to Elizabeth\u2019s school at 11, play in the park next to the school for a half hour, come home and eat lunch, then everyone naps from 12:30-2.

We read a story, I torn off the lights and shut the blinds, turn on the lullaby music, and use that time to start cleaning up. \n\nNow, I have a rule: if you do not want to nap, you don\u2019t have to but you don\u2019t get to get up and play. You either sleep, read, or play quietly on your mat until 2. \n\nMy older nephew has really been pushing back on this. He gets up every time I turn around and tries to be as loud as possible while on his mat. I told my brother and SIL about this and they said he doesn\u2019t like naps and to let him play.

But it was really sharp. He then *told me* to poke him with the pencil and it wouldn't hurt a bit, and put his hand down on the table. I said know and he called me a chicken. So I went to just touch him with it very lightly, and he jerked his hand away, which of course drove it into him. It wasn't deep at all, about a half mm, but the tip if the pencil broke off. He cried to the teacher that I had stabbed him. \n\nI tried to explain what happened, and another kid in line backed me up that he told me repeatedly to do it, but she sent me to the office where they called my mom to come pick me up. The secretary and principal both yelled at me that I'd probably given him lead poisoning, and killed him, and I told them it wasn't true because it's made of graphite. \n\nThey did not take that well. \n\nMy mom was just getting there when she heard them yelling at me about maybe killing him, and came I to the office and cut them off when they started laying into me for correcting them.
