Over the years it has become apparent that he really does not like christmas and thinks the whole present thing is unnecessary. So this year he ordered me a small bottle of perfume and a month before Christmas he hands it to me and says \"here merry Christmas\" now for years we have had several discussions about the thought and effort he puts into special occasions and I think he does the minimal just so I don't get my feelings hurt. So I jokingly stated you r supposed to wrap it and wait till christmas while laughing. This started a major argument with him stating he does not do the \"christmas\" thing and he is not wrapping a gift and we are financially unstable at the moment and do not have money to spend on Christmas gifts. Fast forward to christmas day we go to his mother's house where he pulls out a very large wrapped gift that I had no knowledge of. She has been asking for an ice maker for years and  that's what was inside... a $100 dollar ice maker. She was very happy and I was happy for her. On the way home I asked if he had gotten her the ice maker and if he was the one that wrapped it. He began to scream at me calling me ungrateful and that he knew I was going to act like this about a \"stupid\" gift. I tried to explain that I was not upset about the gift perse I was upset because he got very upset with me previously and told me he does not wrap gifts and that basically he is not going to put any effort into anything involving christmas but he did this for her. The perfume he got was a free gift along with the cologne he ordered for himself and I just asked that he put a little more effort into me as he did with his mother. While I am grateful for my gift, he has made me feel extremely guilty and selfish for not understanding why he is able to put effort into other people he cares about and not me.

He is cheap and a hypocrite.  It isn't about the gift - it is about him being cheap and a hypocrite.\n\nNTA.", "You've known this man for 5 years?... Right, I call this fake. How is this all of a sudden behavior if you stated already how he feels about Christmas. Yet this is the first time you saw him giving his mom a wrapped Christmas present on Christmas?", "NTA this is classic \u201cif he wanted to he would\u201d", "NTA. \n\nThis is a perfect example of, \"If he wanted to, he would\".\n\nAnd it's not that he didn't do a big gift or whatever. It's that he knows you want him to show he cares with a little effort (wrapping something, writing a card) and he outright refuses to.\n\nIt's been 5 years, he's not going to change. You're still young, if you want to be treated differently start planning to move out.", "Dump him. Dump him. Dump him. He does not care about you. Make an exit plan and please be mindful of your safety while getting away from him. His screaming at you tells me he has anger management problems.NTA, unless you stay with this tool.", "NTA \nYour boyfriend treated you horribly in this situation and then tried to make you feel like the bad guy \ud83d\ude1e", "NTA. But you\u2019re definitely in a relationship with the wrong person. You don\u2019t value the same things. He doesn\u2019t seem to value you at all. \nYour choices are to move on and find someone who deserves you and shares the same values or settle and be disappointed continuously for however long the relationship lasts. \nTo me it\u2019s not worth the effort of trying to fix because if he hasn\u2019t put in the effort after 5 years it\u2019s never going to happen", "NTA for this but if you stay with this clod you are. Stop wasting your prime of life with this loser. Leave now.", "NTA and I\u2019m thankful to be dating someone who actually gives a shit about me after reading this. \n\nHonestly this sub makes my fucking skin crawl when I think about some of the shit some people are willing to put up with from others.", "NTA. Why in the world are you with this asshole? Leave! Leave now.  He neither respects you nor cares about you.", "NTA but now you know that the problem isn\u2019t the effort of getting and wrapping a gift or the money or the thought behind it. His problem is the FOR YOU part. He\u2019s not willing to put the time, money and effort in to do that FOR YOU. HE\u2019s showing who he truly is in your relationship. Believe him and leave. You can do so much better than that.", "*\"he is able to put effort into other people he cares about and not me.\"*\n\nThere is your answer. He does not care enough about you to put a little effort into something that is important to you. I am certain that this attitude also manifests itself in other situations. \n\nWhy are you still with him?", "He is an AH. He makes the effort for his mother and doesn\u2019t make it for you. It\u2019s really that simple.", "NTA \n\nHe just don\u2019t care about you, my ex was the same and I got fed up with it, didn\u2019t get him anything for his birthday and he was mad, told him I got him the same he got me for my birthday. At Christmas I went Christmas shopping and got myself everything on my wishlist and gave them to myself from my pets. He was mad and crying to his mother and I told her why I did what I did. She claimed he was good at buying presents and I informed her that I bought the presents for the years we were together", "NTA but after 5 years you should know that you are utterly insignificant to him, you deserve better.", "NTA but why are you together.", "NTA - Your husband is essentially trying to make you feel guilty for callling him out on his behaviour. I can see why he found someone so much younger. What you do is up to you but he has shown you how little he cares for you, he won't change either because for 5 years he had not needed too.", "Now you know why he is with a woman 11 years younger : he is immature and mommy dear will always pass first\n\nY.T.A to yourself if you don't stop being a doormat\n\nYou frankly deserve better", "NTA. Your bf doesn't care. And he doesn't care about you. 5 years ago you were 27 and he was 38. He wasn't looking for a wifey but a placeholder and you're allowing this. \n\nGet out now. You deserve better.", "INFO- why are you still with the man after five years of feeling unappreciated and having to walk on eggshells?", "NTA. Thankfully you're not married to the asshole.", "Because for the last 4 years I have bought his mom's presents and wrapped them. This year I decided not to because she makes it very clear if she does not like then so I did not purchase one this year. This is not fake. And yes this is the first time in 5 years he himself has gotten her anything and wrapped it.", "Well said!", "I bet the look on her face was priceless when you told her that.", "I bet the look on her face was priceless when you told her that.", "I don't think you're being fair. I bet he appreciates the way she keeps his bed warm... Just so long as she doesn't speak too much.", "Then YTA to yourself for tolerating this crap.  There is an entire world out here where you can live happily without a jerk dragging you down.", "Your BF is a selfish jerk. You deserve better than his abuse. He used the classic DARVO technique of turning this on you. And screaming at you is abuse.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what DARVO is, please google it. You may get a whole new perspective on your relationship with him."]}
