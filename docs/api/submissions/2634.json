Yes her fianc\u00e9 was the one in a relationship but a sister choosing to sleep with her sister\u2019s partner like that is a betrayal I\u2019d never forgive. And OP, remember your sister isn\u2019t \u201cowed\u201d a relationship with your daughter. Having aunts is awesome but not if they\u2019re the kind of people like your sister. And non blood aunts/uncles/etc can be just as awesome (in this case the bar is pretty low).", "Fantastic advice! \ud83c\udfc6\ud83d\udc4d\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f\ud83d\udc4f", "No, it is not. But cheaters usually try and come up with some stupid reason why they did what they did or why they got caught. \n\nOp sister probably wants to try and explain why she cheated on her twin with op's man. There really isn't any valid way they could explain it and make it sound good", "Doesn\u2019t matter. Some things are forgivable.", "And who\u2019s to say she wouldn\u2019t try it again? The mother needs to accept what is and quit bugging OP about reconciling with the snakey sis.", "and some are not.", "Sorry. I meant \u201cunforgivable\u201d. My apologies."]}
