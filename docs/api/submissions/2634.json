But your Ex is way worse..", "NTA,  \n\nbut the bitterness might become a burden later.  \nIf you're truly in a good place now, just send her the invite and be done with the drama and make your mom happy.", "NTA: First, I\u2019m sorry you were treated that way by not only your ex, but your twin sister. It\u2019s horrible that your ex respected you so little that he did this. But the evil is on a much higher level of pain when a twin can decide to intentionally do something like this to her twin sister. Everything she did was intentional and calculating. They made sure you were out of the house. They also made sure your daughter was out of the house. No love involved here, just pure lust. Again, I am sorry you had to experience this. But, this may turn out to be the best thing that could have happened for a few reasons;\n\n1. It revealed the true character of your ex boyfriend. Your relationship with him was obviously at a state of auto pilot in your mind since you do t mention any suspicions about the two of them. That day was not spontaneous. He had obviously participated in the planning because he knew your plans for the day. If I were your current fianc\u00e9/husband, I would shake his hand and thank him for being of such low moral value that he couldn\u2019t keep his pants on which opened the opportunity for your new husband to come in yours and your daughter\u2019s life. Going forward, there is zero reason to communicate with the ex unless it\u2019s directly related to minimal coparenting. And I suggest you take advantage of all the free e-mail sources out there that allow you two to communicate only by email about daughter so there is always a record in case you need to update a court. There is never a reason you should be in the same room alone with your ex, ever. Set your boundaries with regard to this relationship and have enough respect for yourself, your husband, and you daughter to enforce it at all times.\n\n2. About the wayward sister; she is an adult. She participated as much or more than the ex in this little weekend frolic. My problem with the sister is much more than the ex. The sister was seeking many things; sexual gratification, validation of her warped sense of love, emotional connection, jealousy, destruction of you as it\u2019s apparent she perceived you as having a loving home that she is a failure at. All of these things must have really stirred a level of hatred of you that she was able to use that hatred to get to that Saturday with zero regrets. None of this was by luck of timing. They didn\u2019t just start planning it on Friday night. That is why I believe there is previous secret relationship there that you can probably dig up if a little effort is applied. I can\u2019t help but feel like she is dealing with some type of sociopathic personality. Just seems like a complete lack of empathy or respect for the one person that should be the closest to her of anyone, even more so than her child. It is not your place, or your business, to fix another grown adult even if it is a twin sister. Your obligation is your soon to be husband, and child. You are only accountable to those two. Not your mom or sister. \n\nYou should set clear, unambiguous, boundaries for yourself and new marriage as it relates to mom and sister. If you don\u2019t want sister at wedding then set that expectation and then make it known to them that it is non-negotiable. Tell them directly, face to face, with your new husband present so they see that you both are on the same page and he fully supports your decisions. That prevents them from sneaking behind your back to try to weaponize him against you. \n\nHave enough self respect for you, fianc\u00e9 that you are not swayed by passive aggressive pleadings of other family members. If you are swayed, that will forever label you as a pushover in their minds whom they can now control forever. \n\nAnd in closing I will state again I don\u2019t think it was there first time together so please get STD tested and make new hubby get tested as well. I wish you well and prayers for God\u2019s blessings on your fresh start and marriage. I am sorry but sometimes burnt bridges should not and can not be built back. Once some time passes, I hope you are able to sit down and write an update or two to this and let us know how things worked out.", "Keep her out of it all.

She has clearly invalidated and not acknowledged your feelings on all that transpired. If she can ignore all of that recent history and try to gaslight you by convincing you to forgive and forget all just because it will make her feel better about her decision to forgive wayward sister then that is evidence that she cares nothing about your feelings and emotions. The opposite of that would be if she told sister that what she did was unforgivable for you and that while she as a mother will forgive her daughter and build a relationship that in no way requires you to do the same thing. If she said that, she would have been expressing respect to you and validating your hurt and emotions by separating her own feelings. But that hasn\u2019t occurred. You\u2019re basically being told to fall in line with what mother says you\u2019re allowed to feel. This whole mess is a slippery slope and goes much deeper than a one time Saturday se$ual affair.
