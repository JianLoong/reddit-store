If someone is toxic it does not matter if they are family or not, you are better of without them.", "NTA you can never trust her to not disrespect your relationships anymore. Sounds like you are marrying a much better man who wouldn't respond to any potential advances from your sister, but that doesn't mean she won't possibly try. You sister should've been a better person and none of this would've happened. I hope you have a happy marriage!", "NTA. I can\u2019t even imagine coming back together as siblings after this level of betrayal.", "Your daughter was still a baby/very young toddler the last time she saw your sister and nephew with any regularity, correct? Then there's no \"back\" for her to have. Their absence is having no effect on her life.\nNTA, and if I were you I'd make it clear to your mother that if she turns up to your wedding with your sister she is in danger of getting cut off too.", "Thank you for this! I\u2019ve been feeling guilt due to it always being my mother and sister most of our lives and now that\u2019s all changed. I don\u2019t want her in my life and have relatively moved past the whole situation, but it\u2019s my mother I don\u2019t want to upset", "We don't know, maybe he was trying to put a fitted sheet on the bed and she tried to help him, then accidently tripped and fell out of her clothes onto his bed post?", "V could have remorse, since OP isn't even listening to her.  Not that it's likely, or that OP has any obligation to hear the homewrecker out.  NTA", "Except she has had remorse, she's attempted to apologize. But it doesn't matter, apology or no, remorse or no, she's not required to have the person who ended her first engagement at her wedding.", "Yeah I think it\u2019s just a lot of backstory because it\u2019s what my mother keeps bringing up because she\u2019s had such a rough life in the past, and now claims she wants to make amends and become a better person. But yeah I don\u2019t think I can look at her the same", "Thank you for the advice \u263a\ufe0f", "Nope. It's ok for her to avoid her toxic sibling. When the child is an adult that can be navigated. Children are not a get out of jail free card for their parents horrible behavior to others. Luckily, this all happened when her sister's child was a baby so the child doesn't remember OP.", "It might upset your mother but that's not your problem, frankly.", "I\u2019m more than a little appalled that your mother chose this to be the act that mended her fences with your sister\u2026 all the choices your sister has made that hurt your mother incidentally, and the one your mother chooses to stop holding grudges over is the targeted betrayal against you? That\u2019s fucking low.", "It is not your job to manage your mother's emotions. She can be disappointed, sure, but she needs to keep away from you.\n\nMoreover, a wedding is the LAST place to stage a reconciliation. It's not the appropriate time or place for some anxiety ridden reunion. \nFamilies aren't always what we imagined we'd have, and your mom has to deal with that, but it's sounds like you have a wonderful child and fiance and I wish you all the joy in the world for your wedding.\n\nTo practice for dealing with mom, \"This is not open for discussion, please stop asking\" and end call/walk away every time she brings it up.\n\nAnd frankly, who gives a flying eff is MOM was able to forgive her, mom wasn't the one who was wronged. GTFOH with that pressure from her.", "Well, one should not feel \"guilt\" unless one did something \"wrong.\" You didn't do anything wrong. So, what you are feeling is \"bad' or \"sad,\" or something else. But, it is not \"guilt\" per se. So, remember that. You did nothing wrong.", "You are going to have to sit your mother down and say \u201cI have been there for my sister my entire life, and she betrayed me, with my daughter\u2019s father. She not only destroyed me but also hurt my daughter. She is not fully to blame as my ex was the one in the relationship, but how could she do such a thing to her own sister and niece, especially when all I had done up to that point was support her. I am not only protecting my own happiness but my daughter\u2019s as well. We deserve stability and peace. So I am sorry but she will never be in my family\u2019s life ever again. I love you mom and I want you there but if you do not respect my boundaries, then I will need to step away from you as well.\u201d\n\nNTA", "Definitely NTA, You owe nothing to her regardless of blood relations. And she clearly doesn\u2019t care if she upsets you, so tell your mom she will not be able to attend if she can\u2019t respect your choices for your day. It\u2019s your day and you want people there who love, respect, and care about you. A drama free day.", "She didn't betray your mother. Your mother can't centre herself in this.", "Totally plausible. Orifices are infamous for being accidentally penetrated. Just ask any ER doctor. It's a wonder we don't all have random peens and lightbulbs flying at us every day!", "Well, good for her, but part of becoming a better person is recognizing that doesn\u2019t make the damage you did when you weren\u2019t go away, and that if people don\u2019t want you in their lives because of that any more, the way you make amends is by respecting their wishes and leaving them alone.", "Good on your mum wanting to become a better but that doesn't involve you forgiving your sister. You're NTA, I wouldn't forgive her either.", "NTA-Is your sister still with your ex??\n\nDon\u2019t listen to your mom , your sister knew what she was doing , make me wonder how long she was having an affair with your ex .", "She can start being a better person by leaving you alone. That\u2019s a key part of making amends \u2014 respecting that someone she\u2019s offended against may be done with her.", "I know many people who've had rough lives and not fucked their twin's partner and father of her child. It's not normal."]}
