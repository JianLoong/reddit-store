I being her sister always tried my best supporting her, as my mother did, but I was more a best friend whereas my mom was the one to force her to sort her life out, rehab etc.\nI on the other hand turned out to be very obsessed with having control and structure in my life which has made it very difficult for me to maintain romantic relationships as I can be controlling and paranoid with abandonment.\nCut forward to when I went to uni, V found herself in a very bad toxic relationship and practically cut off my mother which severed their relationship entirely. She eventually got pregnant and gave birth to my nephew in my second year at uni.\nAfter struggling with romantic partners all my life and having very short term boyfriends, I met my ex fianc\u00e9 (let\u2019s call him D) who I genuinely thought I\u2019d met the one. During this time V had broken up with her toxic ex and was now a single mother, so me and D would have her and my nephew over most weekends.\nI however fell pregnant and a year after my daughter was born D proposed. I had never been happier for starting my family.\nWe decided to wait a year to get married and genuinely enjoyed our new family life.\nHowever one weekend I decided to go see my mother and spend the day with her and my daughter, but we came home early since my mother became busy.\nWhen I arrived home I saw V\u2019s car outside which wasn\u2019t unusual and went inside, nothing would have prepared me for what I would find.\nV and D were alone together in my bedroom on my bed. It seemed like the deed had already been done.\nI went straight to packing for me and my daughter and left. I gave D no chance for excuses, and cut both of them out of my life entirely except for allowing D visitation to our daughter.\n\nJump forward three years I have barely spoken to V, except for when she pops back up into my life to apologise or explain, but I don\u2019t care. There is no excuse she could give me.\nI am now engaged to my beautiful fianc\u00e9 M and he loves my daughter and me more than I could ever imagine.\nAlthough my mother is now begging me to invite my sister to my wedding coming up in June, saying to put the past in the past, since my mother has been able to forgive her and mend their relationship.\nI refuse which has caused tension, she\u2019s telling me this may be the only way to fix our bond and for my daughter to have her aunt and cousin back.\nBut I still refuse, so AITA?", "created_utc": 1668779514, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yykl2e/aita_for_for_refusing_to_invite_my_twin_sister_to/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Ever. And that it would be better for her to accept it.", "NTA at all. And, not everything can be fixed. Your sister did the ultimate betrayal. \n\nYou would not invite an ex friend who did that to you to your wedding. Just because you share DNA with your sister doesn't change that. Your mother has a fantasy that all her kids will get along and will go back to the way it is. Your mother will never stop bothering you on that issue.\n\nI don't blame you. I would not invite her either, if I were you. There is NO excuse for what happened. Once again, not everything can be fixed.\n\nInstead of worrying about this - have a GREAT time planning your wedding and getting married.", "NTA. Your twin sister has absolutely no excuse for doing what she did - because she has no excuse for \u201cnot knowing\u201d how much such a fundamental betrayal would hurt you.", "NTA. Your wedding is about you and your fiance starting a new life together, and you should have the people you want there for it. It's NOT the \"only way\" to fix your relationship with your sister, and it's frankly kind of weird that your mom sees encroaching on such a big life event as the only way y'all can make amends.", "Nta. Your wedding. Your guest list.", "NTA you have been disrespected by the 2 people you cared for most. And disrespect is putting it mildly. Go on with your life without those 2, you will never forget the hurt.", "NTA, it is your special day and she's done nothing to earn the opportunity to be there. She obviously doesn't want to go to support you, because she wouldn't have slept with your fiance if she supported you. \nShe just feels left out, but she set that up for herself. \nDon't back down! Keep toxic people out of your life", "NTA\n\nThis is not an accident.\nThis is not something you can just get over.\nShe slept with your then fianc\u00e9. She knew what she was doing was wrong. She (and your ex) ruined a relationship together.\n\nWhy does she constantly deserve to be forgiven for every mistake she makes without consequences?", "NTA - you owe her nothing", "Nta, these are the consequences of her actions.", "NTA - only invite who you want to your wedding.

Bond\u2019s broken.  If *you* wanted to see whether establishing a new one was possible, that\u2019d be one thing, but that\u2019s up to you.\n\n> and for my daughter to have her aunt and cousin back\n\nD is your daughter\u2019s father, yes?  How exactly does she benefit from having the aunt who helped break up her family back in her life?  Sucks for V\u2019s kid that he\u2019s going to miss out because of Mom\u2019s actions, but *he* can fix that when he\u2019s old enough to reach out himself.  Until then, *your* mom can accept V\u2019s the reason she doesn\u2019t get picture-perfect moments of family togetherness and keep her two cents to herself - and if she won\u2019t drop it, she doesn\u2019t need to be there, either.", "NTA and as a twin I wouldn't want my sister there either", "NTA, that would be devastating.", "NTA. Wow, I'm sorry she did that but it looks like you dodged a missile not marrying D.

Just cut them off your life", "NTA \n\nFuck around and find out!!! Unforgivable in my opinion", "NTA\n\nWhy do you have to use your wedding to mend fences, the same fences your sister broke?\n\nNope. Nope. Nope.\n\nIf and when you want to talk to V, it's entirely up to you. I hope your mom stops putting pressure on you for this. This is a hard boundary.\n\nAlso... There's no excuse good enough for what they both did. That's hilarious.\n\nGood on you for being the great mom you are for co-parenting with D. He may be a horrible fiance, but he could still be a good dad.\n\nYour sister is just a bad sister.", "NTA. What your sister did was unforgivable in my opinion. If you don't want to invite her you don't have to.", "NTA - You don't need her toxicity in your life. You are entitled to not forgive your sister for sleeping with your ex-fiance.

She need to accept & respect your decision like you respect hers when she forgive her lovely daughter!!

Also be careful she is not taking your baby to see her !!", "NTA you have every right to set boundaries with those who have hurt you.

Dont let your mother guilt you into inviting your traitorous sister to what's supposed to be a beautiful day. I'd go NC with mom if she keeps pushing it.", "NTA - nope, that is a profound betrayal from which few can recover. Tell your mom that if she cannot respect your decision to have zero contact with your sister, then you will have to distance yourself from your mom. Be prepared for your mom to sneak in your sister at the wedding and force a public reconciliation.  If you have trusted friends, ask them to escort your sister out if she shows up at your wedding.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely not. It'd be a cold day in hell before I would EVER forgive my sister again.", "NTA. It\u2019s your day, your choice. She committed the worst betrayal.", "NTA I'd consider that unforgivable too. Congratulations on your marriage and on your beautiful family \ud83d\ude0d", "Tell mom \"well bully for you to be able to forgive her!  I have forgiven her too, because she isn't worth hanging onto my hate.  HOWEVER, while I have forgiven her, I will never forget her betrayal and I will never allow her another opportunity to hurt me like that again.  She will never again be a part of my life.  She is not invited and will not be allowed at my wedding.  If you cannot understand that, then you don't need to come either.  End of discussion!\"  Then hang up, shut the door, walk away or whatever you need to do to end the conversation.
