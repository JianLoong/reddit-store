Before Christmas Day, my brother invited Sam to a poker game he was going to with some friends, one of whom is my ex \u201cMax\u201d (we\u2019re on good terms and Sam knows Max is my ex). \n\nI told Sam not to go. My brother and his friends gamble what most people would consider a lot of money at these games, and Sam doesn\u2019t have that kind of money. Sam said he didn\u2019t want to say no because it was an opportunity to get to know my brother better and he was touched to have been invited. He said he would just play for a bit and then say he had had too much to drink and just hang out. I told him at least five times that this was a bad idea and why, but he was adamant he needed to accept the invitation.\n\nHe went, and ended up losing a lot of money, enough that he won\u2019t be able to make his half of the rent this month (we live together). Most of that money, he lost to Max (Max plays A LOT of poker and took pretty much everyone\u2019s money). Sam is obviously upset, and explained himself by saying he just got caught up in not looking like a loser, and wanting to fit in. I said that\u2019s okay, but you need to go and ask for the money back. Sam said he couldn\u2019t. I said he definitely could, Max will give it to him no questions asked. Sam said he wasn\u2019t going to humiliate himself by asking my ex for money back. I said that\u2019s fine but how are you planning to pay the rent? He said he was hoping I would cover it for this month. I said there is absolutely no way I would be paying for his irresponsible decisions, especially after I gave him every opportunity to not be in this situation. Sam said that was very cold and the money would make no difference to me but for him it\u2019s the difference between looking like trash to my family and friends (he is sure him asking for the money back would get around). \n\nI can\u2019t ask my family for opinions on whether I\u2019m the AH for saying no because I know they would go nuts if they knew he was essentially asking me for money. So I just need some people who aren\u2019t invested to share an opinion.\n\nEdit: to people who pointed out the rent needs to be paid - obviously if push comes to shove I will pay it, but right now if he puts me in that position I don\u2019t really know if the relationship will be sustainable. That\u2019s why I need a judgement on whether I\u2019m being unreasonable ", "created_utc": 1703766071, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18sso8w/aita_for_refusing_to_cover_the_money_my_boyfriend/", "score": 11, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He fucked around and he found out he needs to pay the price.", "NTA but I would offer to lend him the difference and he pays it back to you in instalments.

It sounds like he made a mistake with good intentions, what matters is how he makes up for it.", "Nta and id he keeps bugging you red flags", "NTA - you warned your Bf.

You are nta", "First off, the judgement: NTA. You made sure that Sam was well-aware of what he was getting into, and he did just as you feared. It\u2019s entirely on him to make this right, and he\u2019s going to have to swallow his pride on this.\n\nSecond, a question: Are you really prepared to be homeless to prove your point? Or is it a situation where you CANNOT afford to pay the whole rent? Sam sounds like an idiot and definitely TA, but this whole argument has the potential to land you both out on the street. If it comes down to it, you might want to bring your family into it and let them go nuts on him. Maybe that will disincentivize him to do this again. \n\nYou might also take a good long look at Sam\u2019s personality. Is it common for him to let his ego get in the way of making sound decisions? This could be a harbinger of what life could look like with this guy.", "Your BF wanted to look like a cool kid and he gambled away his rent money.

He needs to know what his limits are.", "NTA your family has good reason for going nuts in this case\u2026", "This", "Okay yeah this is the best take.\nOp is NTA at all. Sam is a dummy and put himself in a dumb situation. But that rents gonna have to get paid.\nAnd him asking for that money back is going to cause you problems down the road relationship wise I feel like.\nI say cover it, and if he does something like this again kick him out. Can\u2019t gamble your rent money away. Especially to the ex wtf lmao"]}
