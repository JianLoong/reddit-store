Before Christmas Day, my brother invited Sam to a poker game he was going to with some friends, one of whom is my ex \u201cMax\u201d (we\u2019re on good terms and Sam knows Max is my ex). \n\nI told Sam not to go. My brother and his friends gamble what most people would consider a lot of money at these games, and Sam doesn\u2019t have that kind of money. Sam said he didn\u2019t want to say no because it was an opportunity to get to know my brother better and he was touched to have been invited. He said he would just play for a bit and then say he had had too much to drink and just hang out. I told him at least five times that this was a bad idea and why, but he was adamant he needed to accept the invitation.\n\nHe went, and ended up losing a lot of money, enough that he won\u2019t be able to make his half of the rent this month (we live together). Most of that money, he lost to Max (Max plays A LOT of poker and took pretty much everyone\u2019s money). Sam is obviously upset, and explained himself by saying he just got caught up in not looking like a loser, and wanting to fit in. I said that\u2019s okay, but you need to go and ask for the money back. Sam said he couldn\u2019t. I said he definitely could, Max will give it to him no questions asked. Sam said he wasn\u2019t going to humiliate himself by asking my ex for money back. I said that\u2019s fine but how are you planning to pay the rent? He said he was hoping I would cover it for this month. I said there is absolutely no way I would be paying for his irresponsible decisions, especially after I gave him every opportunity to not be in this situation. Sam said that was very cold and the money would make no difference to me but for him it\u2019s the difference between looking like trash to my family and friends (he is sure him asking for the money back would get around). \n\nI can\u2019t ask my family for opinions on whether I\u2019m the AH for saying no because I know they would go nuts if they knew he was essentially asking me for money. So I just need some people who aren\u2019t invested to share an opinion.\n\nEdit: to people who pointed out the rent needs to be paid - obviously if push comes to shove I will pay it, but right now if he puts me in that position I don\u2019t really know if the relationship will be sustainable. That\u2019s why I need a judgement on whether I\u2019m being unreasonable ", "created_utc": 1703766071, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18sso8w/aita_for_refusing_to_cover_the_money_my_boyfriend/", "score": 314, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Or is it a situation where you CANNOT afford to pay the whole rent? Sam sounds like an idiot and definitely TA, but this whole argument has the potential to land you both out on the street. If it comes down to it, you might want to bring your family into it and let them go nuts on him. Maybe that will disincentivize him to do this again. \n\nYou might also take a good long look at Sam\u2019s personality. Is it common for him to let his ego get in the way of making sound decisions?

Maybe next time it will.\n\nThis wasn't a friendly game, this was for money and the line from Rounders comes to mind: \"If you can't spot the sucker in your first half-hour at the table, then you are the sucker.\"  This wasn't about Christmas cheer, this was about making money.  And to make it, they needed someone to give it up.  He needs to see it for what it is.  He got sentimental about being invited when they saw him as a potential ATM.

Yes, it seems petty but how many more poker games with your brother are potentially in Sam's future if you stay together?

Does he pay it back without prompting?  Does he gamble again?  If he eventually pays you back and seems to have learned his lesson, then this was just one of life's little annoyances.  If he doesn't pay you back, or if he seems to have a gambling problem, this was a cheap lesson.\n\nAnd he can learn about you from this.  Look, people screw up in life.  People sometimes (and *you* will sometimes) make bad decisions sometimes even after being warned they are bad decisions.  They change jobs and the new job sucks.

He'll do it again.  You'll do it.\n\nWhen that happens, what kind of partner will you want and what kind of partner will you be?

Lots of \"I told you sos?\"  \"You got into this mess; you're on your own?\"  Or will *you* want a partner who will say \"Hey babe, sometimes that happens.

You are a bad friend.", "That's not what hustling is unless they rigged the deck or this is secretly a group of professional poker players or something and they hid that detail from the boyfriend. We don't have all the details here so it's very possible the sibling didn't know the boyfriend was betting an amount of money that was significantly beyond his means.", "The ex sound much more like family than Sam. He\u2019s still around after the breakup. That happens with family.", "That isn't pressure from the brother lmao. That's pressure he put on himself. It does not say the brother pressured him to go in any way whatsoever. Issuing someone an invitation is not pressure.", "Can you please explain to me who is a friend to whom in this situation?", "These nuances are too complicated for me. If OP and ex consider themselves still to be a family, they should communicate directly about the money. But I do not see a place for Sam in this schema.", "Never been around a partner\u2019s family have you?", "OP\u2019s brother is the one that invited her partner out. \n\nSo technically, her brother is the one that sort of let this get out of hand knowing that he lives with OP.", "I've been with my husband almost 14 years so I definitely have. If I don't want to do something, I tell them I don't want to do it. But that's not the case here. The boyfriend absolutely wanted to go, then he was enjoying himself so much he gambled away all his rent money. I don't know why you are doing all these mental gymnastics to excuse this guy. He wanted to be there, he went, he lost all his money. End of story.", "So it\u2019s been an eternity for you since your husband was getting to know your family. Perhaps your own family is amazing and easygoing. Many aren\u2019t. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re this obtuse to fail to recognize how a boyfriend meeting his partners brother, who\u2019s a part of a specific group of individuals clearly prone to high stakes gambling, wouldn\u2019t feel pressure to impress or at least fit in. It\u2019s extremely naive of you to think this.", "He could have gone and fit in, and stuck to his original plan to play a few hands then stop. But by his own admission, he got caught up in it and gambled all his money away. It doesn't sound like the boyfriend, to his credit, tried to blame the other players for his actions. He admitted he was having fun and went overboard. How is that OP'S fault??\n\n\nHer brother likely issued the invitation without consulting with her, how humiliating for OP's boyfriend would it have been for her to tell her brother to rescind the invitation because he can't afford it. Instead, she tried to get him not to go while not embarrassing him. But he didn't listen! Then he didn't follow his own plan! Why are you so intent on blaming OP for all of the boyfriend's choices and actions?"]}
