We were having a conversation about a tennis tournament (I\u2019m a huge tennis fan), and he randomly asked me if I thought he could beat Rafael Nadal in a cage fight.\n\nI honestly thought he was joking, laughed, and said no. I thought he was messing around, like those surveys that say 20% of Americans think they can fight a bear or something. My boyfriend\u2019s a strong guy and goes to the gym regularly, but Nadal\u2019s one of the greatest athletes of all time and is obviously going to be ridiculously fit, even if he\u2019s a bit older now.\n\nMy boyfriend took HUGE offence to this. He said I was undermining him as a man by saying a 30-something year old could beat him in a fight, and it\u2019s like if he told me another girl was prettier than me. I clarified that I think my boyfriend is a strong, handsome, guy and is very very fit, but I don\u2019t think he could beat a professional tennis player in a cage fight, just like I don\u2019t think I look like a professional model. \n\nThis discussion went on for 5 minutes until I realised he wasn\u2019t joking, and I just told him that I thought he would win the fight to put an end to it.\n\nWe watched a movie and I thought he had forgotten about, it , but then he went to sleep in the living room, refused to speak to me, and was still pissed in the morning after he sobered up. He told me I was an asshole, rude, and he needed time to himself, then just left after eating breakfast. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t responded to my texts since other than yes or no answers, and to tell me that I need to \"seriously reconsider how I spoke to him.\"This just seems blown well out of proportion and we\u2019ve never had an argument like this before.

I don't think Rafa has taken any fighting, MMA or boxing lessons either.", "Heh. I said something similar today. If all is peachy then stupid behaviour can seem like an adorable quirk, when it tips into more deal breaking behaviour then it\u2019s probably time to call it a day anyway.", "Self publish on amazon and send me the link. This sounds steamy", "on that same front, being a good tennis player doesnt means hed win, nor being able to run for hours on end. neither really have any credit towards being a fighter so its basically dependant on the boyfriends size - otherwise you just cant tell", "Any athelete? Tennis players have nothing that say they could fair well in a fight.\r  \n\r  \nwould you lose to a sprinter? maybe.\r  \nhow about a table tennis gold medallist? i guess it depends on your build\r  \n\r  \nathelete doesnt mean much besides the fact that they are extremely good at what they do, not necessarily anything else.  \n\n\nRafa has no credit to being able to take a punch, no training for it or anything. Assuming the bf doesn't either, it would really be a toss of the coin. like, sure you can run as much as you want to try and outlast your opponent, but in a confined space its pretty hard to do that successfully, especially with no fight training to dodge that shit easily. i feel it fully depends on the boyfriends height and weight, he may be tiny and then sure, hed lose, but if hes 6'4 and heavy, hed most likely win ?? like, he is said to be in good shape himself, so he could keep up, sure not for the 4 hour tennis match length of time, but if he cant land some hits in that time anyways he was never going to win.", "Nah, Tennis playera are not fighters u less they specifically have had training. It could go either way.", "kinda what i was thinking, like if the bf is bigger, hed most likely win ?  \n\n\nsure rafa may be *fitter* in terms of how long he could last, and may be able to throw a very hard swinging fist, but he has no training at *taking* a hit at all, so his fitness doesnt help him there at all. the determining factor would just come down to luck, height and weight really.", "That\u2019s the thing, here: there\u2019s no evidence the BF here has any fight training either. In such a scenario it\u2019s pretty unlikely he\u2019s actually 50/50 against Nadal, who is both a fairly big dude and a world-class athlete who is extremely quick with both his hands and feet and has elite balance, all when judged against other professional athletes.\n\nHer boyfriend\u2026goes to the gym a few times a week. \n\nIt\u2019s not quite the same as fighting, but if you\u2019ve ever played against a pro athlete in a sport other than the one they\u2019re a pro in, you\u2019ve seen the large gap between them and baseline fairly athletic people.", "Stamina is pretty important in a fight, if the people can fight. Assuming neither the insecure bf or the tennis guy know how to fight, it would just be two idiots swinging at each other. The whole concept is stupid. If either of them has training, that person wins.", "Former NHL player Jeremy Roenick basically took this stance when he was asked how pro boxers would fair against NHL enforcers if the fight took place on the ice. JR contends that once you put them on skates, on the ice, it's a completely different kind of fight. Can't say I disagree.", "Why should partners lie to each other?", "Why would anyone ask something they know the answer to? And why would you want your partner to lie to you? Are we 5? Truthful communication is key to any meaningful relationship.", "I'm genuinely curious as to how you think I'm antagonising him? I did apologise in the moment and tell him that I thought he would win the fight as I didn't want to argue with him. I also don't intend to show him this post whichever way the judgement goes, and I absolutely don't want out of the relationship!", "Gross", "she\u2019s toxic for answering a question truthfully?", "This guy is so immature!  As a 22 year old you have the world at your doorstep, don't waste your time on this guilt tripping tool.  A real man would see the folly!", "ah yes, nothing screams aLpHa like extremely fragile ego\u2026", "I doubt it.", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I'm not assuming anything... except that OPs bf has an ego problem...", "We are assuming he\u2019d automatically win a fight against OP\u2019s boyfriend.", "Um, pretty sure that's 45 KILOGRAMS, which is about 100 lbs, and some wolves get as big as 140 lbs, so yeah depending on the wolf... Well, let's just say better have good health /life insurance before tangling with one.\n\nI know, I'm being a pedantic ah, sorry not sorry. :)", "Dude any wolf would shred a human easy", "Loooool, you would end up in the hospital from bite wounds even if you managed to drive a small wolf off, which is not a given since wolves are muscular and know where to bite to open up an artery. It's like getting in a knife fight, you would be lucky to survive.", "Yes and they put that to the test!  \n\n\n[https://en.as.com/en/2019/07/22/videos/1563802634\\_106742.html](https://en.as.com/en/2019/07/22/videos/1563802634_106742.html)", "Katie Nolan did a few segments like that and it was hilarious.

I sure as heck wouldn\u2019t.\n\nAnd there\u2019s another factor that matters when fighting an amateur: he\u2019s a lefty.", "Oh, I didn\u2019t read the part where he is a tennis player", "\" My boyfriend\u2019s a strong guy and goes to the gym regularly,\" ... You really think some insecure little gym-boy is THAT good? Those even halfway competent in martial arts are not THAT insecure.

I imagine insane hand eye coordination and excellent body control translate pretty well to fighting. OPs soon to be ex would maybe have a point if they were a trained fighter but that wasn\u2019t mentioned in the post.

Tennis players have nothing that say they could fair well in a fight.\n\nHand eye coordination, reflexes, stamina and agility are worthless in a fight I guess. \n\nThe rest of your post reads like you're the boyfriend.", "He probably has experience continuing to play with pain though?", "Yes on meaningful adult conversations not on what was clearly meant to be a silly joke.", "Don't listen to that person. Who is obviously projecting their own ego into this situation and likely thinks they'd in in a fight against a pro athlete as well.", "The original commenter thinks \"antagonising\" means \"vilifying.\" OP, you didn't, and you shouldn't feel obligated to spew absurdities in order to soothe your bf's absolutely crackers ego. I guess if he asks you if you think he can jump to the moon, you're supposed to say yes?? Absolutely mental.", "OP, I am not an expert on relationships but I would like to say that tennis players have an insane strength. Like I want to randomly calculate it. \n\nA tennis ball reaches the velocity of 200 km/h at least. \nProbably. And a tennis ball would be like 50g or let it be 100g most right? They have to react immediately and hit back. I think that's like 0,1 seconds probably. 1 second would be too much. \n\nF. 0,1= 0,05. 60\n\n(F=30N)\n\ni made up that 60 as well because i had to convert it to meter and second. But they apply this force like during whole match average. Holding that racket and stuff is probably like crazily insane and exhausting.\n\nThey are fit, they have enough stamina, they are trained and professional. Although a cage fight isn't their field, even if he hits the gym it isn't your boyfriend's field as well. My bet is definitely on the tennis player. \n\nLike he is kinda cocky and probably expected you to say, yeah my man is the strongest wow so sexc hot mascular type of thing. (I am not shaming that kinda cringe but he was drunk) \n\n I think you are right and he kinda overreacted imo, because why act like that when sober? NTA", "Never denied that he did. Just saying anyone assuming an automatic win for Nadal knows nothing about fighting", "I\u2019m saying you\u2019re wrong being someone who\u2019s trained with professional fighters and are close friends with them.

What it means is that Nadal, for work, keeps himself in peak physical shape and has every convenience to do so, including world class professional coaching, diet, and equipment.OP's bf goes to the gym as a hobby. It's dumb to say OP's bf has better odds than a dude who is near the peak of a sport.
