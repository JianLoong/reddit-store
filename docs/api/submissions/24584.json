I thought he was messing around, like those surveys that say 20% of Americans think they can fight a bear or something.

He said I was undermining him as a man by saying a 30-something year old could beat him in a fight, and it\u2019s like if he told me another girl was prettier than me. I clarified that I think my boyfriend is a strong, handsome, guy and is very very fit, but I don\u2019t think he could beat a professional tennis player in a cage fight, just like I don\u2019t think I look like a professional model. \n\nThis discussion went on for 5 minutes until I realised he wasn\u2019t joking, and I just told him that I thought he would win the fight to put an end to it.\n\nWe watched a movie and I thought he had forgotten about, it , but then he went to sleep in the living room, refused to speak to me, and was still pissed in the morning after he sobered up. He told me I was an asshole, rude, and he needed time to himself, then just left after eating breakfast. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t responded to my texts since other than yes or no answers, and to tell me that I need to \"seriously reconsider how I spoke to him.\"This just seems blown well out of proportion and we\u2019ve never had an argument like this before.
