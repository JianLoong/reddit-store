I thought he was messing around, like those surveys that say 20% of Americans think they can fight a bear or something.

He said I was undermining him as a man by saying a 30-something year old could beat him in a fight, and it\u2019s like if he told me another girl was prettier than me. I clarified that I think my boyfriend is a strong, handsome, guy and is very very fit, but I don\u2019t think he could beat a professional tennis player in a cage fight, just like I don\u2019t think I look like a professional model. \n\nThis discussion went on for 5 minutes until I realised he wasn\u2019t joking, and I just told him that I thought he would win the fight to put an end to it.\n\nWe watched a movie and I thought he had forgotten about, it , but then he went to sleep in the living room, refused to speak to me, and was still pissed in the morning after he sobered up. He told me I was an asshole, rude, and he needed time to himself, then just left after eating breakfast. \n\nHe hasn\u2019t responded to my texts since other than yes or no answers, and to tell me that I need to \"seriously reconsider how I spoke to him.\"This just seems blown well out of proportion and we\u2019ve never had an argument like this before.

I don\u2019t think either of them was taking it too seriously, but she had him down and pinned in a matter of seconds.", "Men already have this debate all the time.   The Muhammad Ali Vs Bruce Lee argument.   We have weight classes for a reason.   I've never been knocked out by anyone a weight class below me.   Never lost to anyone 2 below me. \n\nI really don't care how fast a tennis player is.   They aren't gonna knock out an amateur heavyweight.   Eventually they will get close and it's over.", "He's a multi-athlete who also plays football and golf and I'm pretty sure he's studied taekwondo. I think he'd be fine against Mr Random Gymbro.", " Nadal is reading this post and will be sending a challenge shortly.", "Bahahahahaha! This is brilliant!", "[deleted]", "Then maybe you can back me up or knock me down. Of course we don\u2019t know much about the bf, but I\u2019d be very hesitant to assume that any pro athlete would win a fight. Of course they\u2019d probably be in great shape and conditioning, but that doesn\u2019t equate to being a good fighter to me.", "Comes first and is immediately done?  Sounds right.", "Count me in!", "I got ten on the tennis pro", "That's the best part of the argument tho, bc if he ended up having to fight a pack of wolves and inevitably loses, he can still claim that he would've beat a single wolf!", "I\u2019m pretty confident I could beat a single wolf in a fight, as long as he doesn\u2019t have the element of surprise. You gotta figure a wolf is used to attacking in groups from behind. It\u2019s not familiar with weak points on a bipedal human and would likely be confused by a frontal attack. You\u2019re going to be seriously injured for sure, but if you can give up an arm and go for the stranglehold or eye gouge, especially if you manage to break one of its legs, you should be able to secure the victory. \n\nBut I\u2019m also confident I would lose to even two or three wolves. They\u2019d circle and attack from behind when you\u2019re occupied with one. \n\nThat\u2019s why you always need to be packing, because you\u2019re not likely only going to have to fight one wolf. That\u2019s just silly.", "John McEnroe back in 2017 said that if Serena Williams was playing with the men, she would be ranked around 700.\n\nSo, unless you are in the top 1000 male tennis players you won't stand a chance.", ">Nadal at the ripe old age of 37 (lol) is still so far out of bf's league that it's not even funny.\n\nThe bf's offense and pearl clutching at the idea of a 37 year old being able to lay him out is also hysterical. Buddy, he's not a geriatric living in a nursing home.", "There\u2019s nothing to suggest the boyfriend knows how to fight, either. In fact, when someone knows how to fight, they don\u2019t feel the need to ask these questions and they also don\u2019t get offended when someone tells them the truth about the result.\n\nRafael Nadal, though, has to stay strong and incredibly fit as a job. That\u2019s literally pretty much all he does all day. It\u2019s fair to assume some gym-child upstart won\u2019t have the advantage.", "Along with all the other qualities, you have to remember that a tennis player has endurance. They play for a long time and need to be able to sprint across the court dozens of times an hour pretty much at will. \n\nBig strong fighters can lose simply because they get worn out. Unable to defend any more, they drop their hands or can\u2019t get out of the way soon enough.", "Tennis players have excellent footwork, endurance, and core strength. They can also generate a ton of power from their legs/hips/core. That power goes into hitting a ball 100+ mph but imagine they put that power into a punch. Nadal isn\u2019t beating anyone with actual fight training but he\u2019s gonna do well against drunk idiots throwing haymakers.", "Don\u2019t listen to this person. Their ego is just as inflated and fragile as your (hopefully soon to be ex-)boyfriend. \nYou did nothing wrong. He is delusional. Of course you thought he was joking! He\u2019s a gym rat who wants to go against a world class athlete. Find a better person to date. NTA.", ">I absolutely don't want out of the relationship!\n\nWhy not? A man with this fragile an ego for something so trivial has a lot going wrong for him. Maybe if you convince him to go to the therapy he desperately needs things might be salvageable but this is not a good glimpse. (insert AITA cliche phrase here)", "> I did apologise in the moment and tell him that I thought he would win the fight as I didn't want to argue with him. \n\nWhile your reason behind the apology was to stop the argument, those kinds of apologies don't mean anything. Also wana note that you didn't have to apologize. Just remember he's a tennis player, not a fighter,and being in shape doesn't mean they can fight or win one.", "Go see the Barbie movie \ud83d\ude02", "Exactly, age is also just another factor. \n\nThat said, a stupid, sedentary, overweight, out of shape late 30s me has decked an active 27 year old professional athlete. And not by surprise. \n\nNow, the active early 20s version of myself has been used like a punching bag by my more senior early fifties instructor.", "It's like getting in a knife fight when you don't have a knife and also any fighting experience with somebody like that. I'm just trying to think about what a human could bring to a fight with a wolf that is going to do much damage to the wolf and coming up empty.", "An adult male chimp averages about the same (40-60kg / 90-130lbs) and they and even much smaller females can pretty much shred even the most elite human fighters to absolute ribbons. The idea that weight or even \u201cmuscle\u201d is a defense against the way wild animals fight is pretty silly.", "ma'am/sir, you have provided great service today. Thank you", "This is awesome. After they got beaten, they were really hyped about her skills.", "Well this is lovely, and I didn't get you anything.", "Made my night!", "What you just described this tennis player having the edge is just lasting longer. His had eye coordination is for a ball. Sure might help him slightly,but as the other guy said, if op bf has the height weight and knows how to throw a punch or has minor experience, it could easily be a wrap.", "Exactly. This guy would be surprised by the number of dudes twice his age or older than can hold their own. Underestimating anyone is dangerous.", "Yeaaah, wolves run faster, their fur repels grip and bite better, they're more experienced with fighting, they have teeth and massive bite strength. A person can... awkwardly punch downward. Get their foot bitten if they try a kick...", "I believe I could fight off a coyote, but the next question would be how very many stitches I need after. Lots. So many.", "may be true,  but then I don't think most people's standard is an Arabian wolf.   I didn't even know that was a thing.  a lot of gray wolves are quite large.  45 lbs isn't even a big dog.   more like a coyote.", "[deleted]", "I googled it, to see what other answers people have come up with, and the first result I got was [https://a-z-animals.com/blog/could-an-unarmed-human-beat-a-wolf/](https://a-z-animals.com/blog/could-an-unarmed-human-beat-a-wolf/). I know it's just a random link from google, but it argues the case that a human is not going to win this fight pretty well, although I suppose I came into the site already agreeing with them. I just cannot think of a way an unarmed human would beat a wolf.", "Hahaha. For real. Coyotes are scary to me. They are everywhere.  But we don't know they are there. Sometimes, I see them around during the day. Sneaking around. Well, while I am driving. I live close to a river, and there are a lot of roads that go over it. Right next to neighborhoods. \n\nA friend said she saw one watching her while she was walking on a paved trail. It was at a park. But the trail went through river trails too. Just watching.", "That's like a kid saying their dad is a doctor. You know an athlete, cool. You have zero qualifications and also what you're saying is wrong, as I've described in my previous post. It's laughable to defend your statement with no actual counter arguments, just a claim of status based on an random acquaintance", "Difference is I\u2019ve trained with them and seen multiple D1 athletes get their ass beat. By D1 I\u2019m talking about people who\u2019ve gone pro later and still would get their ass beat by the guy who\u2019s trained for like a year.", "[deleted]", "I replied back because they didn\u2019t fuck off. Imma delete comments since they offend y\u2019all so badly."]}
