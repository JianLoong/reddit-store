Because of this, Corey never fails to shove it in Jeff's face every time Jeff makes a snide comment when Corey fails to meet his expectations.

Corey has a more modern mindset. Jeff thinks Corey isn't a \"real man\" due to this but realistically Corey is doing much better than us.

He would be pretending to be grateful. If he were truly grateful, that's the exact opposite of the reaction he would have.\n\nThanks to the information in your edit, we know that your husband is 100% in the wrong. Your brother, despite not being a \"real man\" in your husbands eyes, just provided for your family. Not to save your son's life, because the doctors already did that. Your brother did this to save you and your husband. Jeff needs to realize that his \"old school\" bullshit views alienated someone who was in his corner even after the shit your husband heaped on him. Your brother saved your husband's ass. He's a damn fine man. \n\nAnd, you not dealing with the drama was you actively supporting your husband in this argument. You made this bed.
