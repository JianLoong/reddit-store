Even as I\u2019m getting close to full dilation, after a certain point, I don\u2019t want a lot of people in the room. I just don\u2019t feel comfortable with it. He then asked \u201cWhy does your mom get to be there but mine doesn\u2019t?\u201d I explained to him that it\u2019s different because, while I love his mom, I\u2019m just not comfortable with that and honestly, I don\u2019t want her seeing \u201cdown there\u201d. Plus, having three support people plus the medical team will be a lot. I\u2019d rather have my mom on one side, my fianc\u00e9 on the other, and not have to worry about my MIL having to just sit in the background alone while all the action is going on. \n\nHe said \u201cWell I\u2019ll swap out with my mom so she can come in\u201d I again explained that I don\u2019t want that. I don\u2019t want her in the room while I\u2019m pushing, and even then, I certainly don\u2019t want him leaving the room because this is HIS child, not hers or anyone else\u2019s. \n\nAll he said after that was \u201cwell I\u2019ll let you have that conversation with her then\u201d but I can tell he\u2019s upset about it. \n\nSo AITA for only wanting him and my mom in the room?", "created_utc": 1692056147, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15rb2m6/aita_for_not_wanting_mil_in_the_room_while_im/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And if he thinks he needs his mommy\u2019s support then tell him that he can sit in the waiting room with her.\n\nNo offense to his mom, she could be a saint. But she has never been there when you needed some one to clean you up or deal with when you have been truly sick. This is a moment definitely just for the two of you and maybe even your mom. \n\nI would never ask my daughter in laws to let me watch them give birth. And I\u2019m all for their moms being with them during delivery. My second granddaughter was born, yes, I was in the hospital at their invitation.

From the get go, I made clear to him that the birth and my postpartum recovery are not one of those \u201cequal opportunity moments\u201d - no one comes to the hospital or shows up at the house until I am good and goddamn ready. If that means my mom shows up before his (it will, because my mom actually has been pretty good about boundaries\u2026 unlike his mother), so be it. \n\nTell him that he can have his mom be there the next time he decides to take a massive dump on your bed after being constipated for nine months. Be sure to tell him that it\u2019s only fair that your mom be there as well.\n\nAlso, your husband\u2019s main job right now is to keep you from having to fight these battles alone.

Because if he can\u2019t put you first on the day you deliver your first child, it will be an uphill battle to get him to *ever* put you first. I would tell him to decide who he\u2019s going to be married to, because his presence in the delivery room is optional and at your discretion. If he isn\u2019t willing to put you first, I\u2019d strongly consider staying with your mother after you give birth to sort things out without interference from him and his mother. Being badgered by AH husbands and MILs is a pretty massive contributor to PPD. \n\nTell your OB and the hospital staff that *only* your mother and husband (unless you rescind his invitation) are allowed in the delivery room, no matter what your husband says you\u2019ve agreed to or tries to pressure you into. \n\nIf your husband refuses to tell her, then do it yourself, but don\u2019t let anyone guilt you for how it\u2019s received.

Keep finances separate.", "Hey uh\u2026these are even bigger red flags than if MIL was pushing to be there. Like, if I heard these before being pregnant I would reconsider being pregnant with a dude about it. You\u2019re pregnant now so you need to sort this out now, and for me that would be marriage counselling.", ">I\u2019m not gonna pay attention to anything you\u2019re saying, I honestly don\u2019t care what you have to say at this point\n\nLook this statement here is a problem. This is a medical event that can go seriously fucking sideways and be life threatening for you.\n\nTherefore what you have to say is incredibly important and what he has to say is less important. You are deciding who is going to be on hand to make decisions if you become incapable of making them yourself (for example if you lose consciousness).\n\nIf he is disregarding your decisions now, over an important medical issue, he will continue to disregard them into the future on issues big and small. I'll bet if you think back over your relationships you'll find he's done the same thing in smaller ways.\n\nThis is not a person I would marry because the fundamental disrespect of ignoring you when you voice your needs will keep going.\n\nAlso I didn't quote the part about yelling because that's irrelevant. It's an argument over your medical choices, of course you'll raise your voice if you're not being listened to.", "NTA.  Tell him that he doesn't need to be there either.  Give the doctors and nurses a code word to boot him out if he's not supportive.  Does MIL even want to be there?", "(I hope he reads this) Wow real mature there buddy! Your wife will be in a very vulnerable position. You are not the one pushing out a human from your body. You should be prioritizing your wife\u2019s comfort so she can deliver your child safely. Childbirth is scary and your wife being in the right mental state is the priority. Grow up", "Show him this post, have him read the comments. Hopefully that will help him see that YOUR labor is not about him. Labor is a medical event. YOU are the patient, not him and not his mom.", "Nobody cares about his opinion because birth is a medical procedure and he isn\u2019t the one having it! He has no more right to an opinion about who witnesses you giving birth than he does you having a breast biopsy or root canal. \nSMDH it\u2019s like a whole generation of mommy\u2019s boys.", "Have him read all these comments and tell him of he continues acting entitled and putting his comfort over yours while you will be in pain and vulnerable he wont be allowed in the room either. You need the support he doesnt. He should grow a pair and start acting like a good person, fiance, and future father", "You know what\u2026 at this point you should talk to his mom honestly. She would probably shame him in this situation. I didn\u2019t realize she didn\u2019t already express wishes to be there. He\u2019s being obnoxious.", "THIS!!!!!!", "Muppet used very correctly here.", "My first thought was that that conversation doesn\u2019t need to happen", "This 100%. Plus---I wouldn't even say anything to MIL about it. Wait until SHE brings up being in the delivery room, and then tell her no, just husband and your mother.", "Yeah, exactly. SO is acting like this is a family event that they are planning at their home, like a BBQ or something. This ain\u2019t a \u201clet\u2019s make sure we invite both sides\u201d situation. Whoever OP wants with her is who should be there, period.", "Good for you. My wife just had our first and we had no visitors in the hospital and have made it clear to everyone they can visit on our schedule. It\u2019s still been a lot but everyone has been respectful of the boundaries we set.", "Also, literally not a metaphor. Most women poop while pushing.", "The nurses! Tell the nurses the dngaf about who\u2019s feelings they hurt (in a good way) and there are more them", "LoL", "I really like this idea!!", "Yes this! The hospital/OB is almost certainly willing to make up whatever rules you need. \u201cOh sorry, only the father and people related to the mother allowed\u201d. \u201cOh sorry, we only allow 2 support people and they can\u2019t change\u201d. Whatever you need", "Yeah it\u2019s only the beginning \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f.", "Uh...are you saying MIL's \"very important moment\" trumps OP's actual rights?", "This is in no way a moment that her MIL is entitled to live. Would you want you MIL to watch as you live the most vulnerable moment of your life?!? Invite her next time you get a colonoscopy\u2026.", "It's not weird. \n\nShe's not married yet and if this goes sideways her parents are her next of kin and will be responsible for any medical decisions.\n\nAlso her mum has given birth before, wiped her ass before, and therefore is someone who can be trusted to be in the delivery room. There's nothing OP is going to do in that room that her Mum hasn't previously cared for before (OP can poop, bleed, vomit, pass out etc and her Mum has likely cared for her through all of that before).", "I wanted my mom in the room with all three of mine. I don\u2019t think it is weird at all.", "How is that weird? I am going to be giving birth soon and I will have my husband and my mom in the room with me as well. My husband because 1. he's the father of our child 2. he's my person. But I also want my mom in the room with me because she's my rock, she's gone through labor before (aka having me and my brother) and I know she will be a calming presence in a room full of medical staff while I'm actively trying to push a child out.", "\u2026 i somehow feel like \u00ab\u00a0 I don\u2019t want my MIL to see my vagina and see me poop myself\u00a0\u00bb is a pretty reasonable request when you are pushing a baby out.\n\nThe MIL can see the baby once it\u2019s born. She will still be part of the family. She is not entitled to override OP\u2019s wishes during HER medical procedure", "No. This is a medical procedure the ONLY people that should be in there are people OP is comfortable with and the medical professionals. \n\nAre you the MIL?", "I think we found the MIL\u2019s account.", "That's insane to even think that the MIL should be at the birth.", "Just wondering are you a women or a man ?", "NTA this was the benefit of having a baby while hospitals still had covid restrictions. There was a built in excuse. I feel for you though, I wouldn\u2019t want my MIL there either and she\u2019s a very valued member of my child\u2019s life.", "Oh please, are you a woman? Do you want some stranger looking up your hoo ha?", "This is the stupidest comment I\u2019ve seen this week.", "Bold assumptions.", "Fianc\u00e9? Is that you? \n\nIf so, looks like you\u2019re in the wrong sub. Looks like you\u2019re looking for the \u201cmen who have lost their balls, don\u2019t know how to stand up to their own mothers, and can\u2019t do right by their SO\u201d sub instead.", "OK troll.", "Ooh,yes! This is a much better idea. And if he refuses, well, then OP knows where she stands.", "My mother even told me that she would go with me if I needed her to, but that she and my dad were the only ones there (not including medical personnel) for myself and my siblings' births and it was extremely special. I chose to give birth with just my husband too.", "He\u2019s young. Hopefully he can see his mistake. He should definitely read this thread.", "Exactly", "And pee!!!", "Oh my god. My mom is dead and I\u2019d be fucking livid. My MIL would never say that to me but I\u2019m sure I would be made to feel a bit guilty if she wanted to be there. Ugh I\u2019m so sorry.", "Agree 100% with this, OP. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9 is gonna have to grow up quick. If he acts like this now, he\u2019s not gonna be any better when the baby comes. Do not make any legal commitments with this man if this is the hill he wants to die on.", "I think it\u2019s the SO", "Male.", "Male, but I would definitely feel welcome to family if I was pregnant.", "Ok wen you give birth you can decide who gets to see you at your most vulnerable. Just think won\u2019t it be great if you had to have a doctor show e his fingers in your anus every hour or so to see how stretched your you were and if you were ready to push out a watermelon. Than we get you mom, mil, sis, and the whole family watch you get torn in half.", "It's a physically traumatic medical procedure involving poop and blood.\n\nIt is not a spectator sport.\n\nInvite your MIL to your next colonoscopy. Have her bring a camera. Good times."]}
