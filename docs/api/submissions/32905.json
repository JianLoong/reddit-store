Your ex is hurt because he believes that if you communicated with him, the marriage could have been saved, but I imagine you told him plenty before you finally decided to leave, and he just did not think you would go. That\u2019s not your fault. You probably grieved the marriage during the marriage, and he had to grieve once he realized the divorce was real.  If you can talk to him, remind him that you fought for the marriage but he would not change until you left. He broke your heart as well.\n\nEdit: You can have a tough talk with him, but he needs to apologize to YOU tbh, and take some ownership of his major role in dissolution of the marriage.

If he wants to be mad, let him.  He's not your husband, you don't have to care about his mood, or whether he likes you.  Keep your communication about coordinating child custody issues, and get on with your life.", "NTA, did you really not tell he you needed him to be more engaged in your marriage?

Now we have 50/50 custody, and he is so much more engaged with our kids. I set firm boundaries for my limitations and now, 6 years later, we are both so much happier and co parent perfectly.

It was probably an ill advised thing to say and warrants a clarification, but it's quite possible that both he and you are better people after the divorce.
