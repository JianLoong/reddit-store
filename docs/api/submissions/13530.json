They were waiting across the street and had a stroller as well as some groceries. He mentioned that the next bus wouldn't be for about an hour and that no taxis would come because of the stroller and said he could pay for gas, told me his address which is about a 20 minute drive.\n\nI expressed I wasn't comfortable doing that, apologized, and checked my bus app which showed a bus coming in 3 minutes, told him that the bus was due and he left. They didn't end up getting on the bus, I later found out that bus is one of two routes at that stop and that only goes to a local grocery store along the route. If they took it they'd still have to wait 30 mins for the next bus that goes to where he told me they lived.\n\nI feel really bad because they didn't look dressed for the weather, (~-10\u00b0C) and it was beginning to get dark. I feel like this could make mta because they now have to wait about 40 minutes with their baby in the cold for a bus to get home. But also I couldn't see if there was actually a baby, and they are total strangers to me so for all I know it could have been a way to get access to my vehicle or house (extremely unlikely but not totally unheard of in my city). I don't often Uber or Taxi but I also wasn't sure why they wouldn't be able to fold up the stroller to take one?\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680138524, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1266ul8/aita_for_not_giving_a_young_couple_and_their_baby/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds sketchy, and even more so if they weren't dressed for the weather despite apparently being in charge of a baby. I reckon you can usually get a pretty good feel for a person after a few seconds, and clearly something was telling you it wasn't right - definitely trust that instinct.\n\nIf I was them, I'd have taken that bus to the grocery store as it would have been warm, then just milled around the store (again, warm) for 30 minutes until the right bus came.", "As a woman, I\u2019m always wary of giving rides, even if it\u2019s to other girls and babies. There\u2019s too many schemes where they use children to lower your defenses so they can rob you or worse. NTA, if you were uncomfortable, it was probably for a reason.", "Why wouldn\u2019t a taxi pick up people with a stroller?", "NTA\n\nTaxis take strollers every dang day.", "NTA. This sounds like some sort of ruse/scam, and was likely dangerous.", "NAH\n\nThe unfortunate reality of the world we live in is that giving strange people rides home is dangerous. Maybe they were legit or maybe not.", "NTA the stroller excuse doesn't make sense. Was it some ultra deluxe stroller that doesn't fold to be placed in a trunk? If so, I don't know how they would have gotten it on the bus either. That's really a them issue, and if you couldn't even see the baby I think you were right to trust your instincts.", "NTA. Human trafficking many times involves women and children as part of the ruse to gain trust. They could have gotten a cab or an Uber (strollers fold). You did the smart thing op. Don\u2019t second guess yourself.", "NTA this was a set up. Call uber. Ask you to call someone. Get on the first bus and stay warm at least on the way to the next stop and get closer to your home. Also plan and look at weather before heading out. \nI also maybe would have called the police for the safety of the child, if there was one. Women get killed and trafficked because 'we feel bad' or want to be nice. \nTrust your gut always!", "NTA. Your instincts were telling you something. Something similar happened near me. Except it was a woman alone with a fake baby covered in a carriage. She was begging people for a ride. She was dressed in just a t shirt and pants. No jacket in the cold. Someone called police and she took off running leaving the carriage when they arrived. Some people gave her money. There was a knife in the carriage and the plastic baby doll. \n\nAnything could of happened to you. They could have called a taxi or Uber. They could of robbed you or car jacked you.", "NTA\n\nWe all want to be generous to strangers.  But, there's nothing wrong with being safe either.  One: if the cold was too intense they should have taken the available bus to the nice heated grocery store and waited there.  And two: speaking as an Uber driver I don't refuse rides because of strollers and I'm fairly sure I'm not allowed to. \n\nThere's something about their story that doesn't add up.  I think you made the right call.", "You\u2019re not a taxi.", "NTA...but I think I can clear up the stroller comment: unless it was one that has the baby seat that clicks into it,it's just a stroller. Drivers are not allowed to operate without every passenger secured. You can leave your baby in the stroller on the bus,but a car would require the stroller to be put away and someone would have to hold the baby in the car.", "NTA. Colleen Stan was kidnapped and held prisoner for seven years after she accepted their ride. She felt safe entering their vehicle because her kidnapper had his wife and kid in the van when he offered the ride.\n\nWas this a possibility? Unlikely. However, a baby and a wife with him doesn't mean they were safe or had good intentions.", "NTA - that was a trap", "NTA", "NTA\n\nThis just screams suspicious, even if it was true. you can fold a stroller into an uber or taxi,  and they were underdressed, but they went out like that. and you didn't know them at all and even if they were, the baby if there was one was underdressed too, and also they should know this information since they got to the store after all. unless they got a ride there.\n\npoor failure in their part does not constitute an emergency on yours", "NTA. Sadly you never know a strangers true intentions, and approaching you like that doesn\u2019t seem innocent. I\u2019m weather like that they shouldn\u2019t have brought the baby out at all when they knew they\u2019d be waiting for public transit. Also from a safety perspective, did you have a car seat for their baby to use in your car? You were helpful in checking the bus schedule. You\u2019re not responsible for their choices.", "NTA it\u2019s a liability issue on your end and you don\u2019t know them. It sounds unnecessary of them to bring an entire family to grocery shop without a car in -10 weather in the first place. The baby should have been home in that weather.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t feel comfortable having strangers in your car. You don\u2019t have to feel any obligation helping others if you don\u2019t feel safe. And since they apparently have a child, they should\u2019ve planned better their trip to the store.", "NTA. Other people's poor planning is not your problem to solve.  \nUber or Taxi would have required them to have a car seat for the baby. The companies won't provide them. It wasn't about the stroller, but the car seat.", "NTA. we live in a very dangerous world. i wouldn\u2019t have done it either. you can\u2019t just trust someone because they have a baby, babies have been used to prey on people before. if you felt something wasn\u2019t right and you didn\u2019t want to do it, that\u2019s fine. it could\u2019ve easily been a trap.", "NTA.\n\nNot your problem, they should've planned ahead. Get an Uber or something or call a family member.", "NTA.  If they were really in a pickle then it sucks but failure to plan ahead on their part doesn\u2019t constitute an emergency on your part.  There was the possibility that it was a ruse, however, and it could have been dangerous for you.", "NTA. Never give rides to strangers.", "NTA\n\nWhile maybe (or maybe not) they were just a friendly couple that needed a ride, there are a lot of situations where some people are pretending. You're not the asshole because you're taking precautions just in case.", "NTA. If it feels off, it\u2019s probably off. You trusted your gut feeling and there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\n\nThey simply could have called the taxi company and asked for a big taxi (like a van).", "NTA, why didn't he call an Uber?", "NTA\n\nThey could\u2019ve been all murder-y.  \ud83d\ude2f  Stay safe", "NTA\n\nThere are van taxi's.\n\nEven a regular taxi is fine, most strollers collapse.", "NTA\n\nThis is an a very big ask - to knock on a stranger's door and ask for them to drive you to your destination. And then there is of course the possibility that they are criminals and are using a baby as a way to disarm you.\n\nIf I felt extremely guilty I might order a UBER or equivalent for them since an UBER would have to take the stroller. Since they mentioned a taxi you might ask them to reimburse you in some way - Venmo or just cash since presumably they would have had taxi fare.", "Nta sounds sketchy, you aren\u2019t the only person they could ask. If they had a phone they could call a family member or something.", "NTA, there are red flags obviously, some that they could account for some maybe not. Things like did the temp drop faster than expected, spurring him to seek other transportation. Did he not have enough for a taxi or Uber but was too proud to say that, but was willing to give what he had to compensate for your gas, are all things that could be the case, or could not. In the end you did what you needed to do for you. You, your safety, and peace of mind are the priority.", "Do all Americans live in fear like this?
