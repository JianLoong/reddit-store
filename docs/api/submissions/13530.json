Other people's poor planning is not your problem to solve.  \nUber or Taxi would have required them to have a car seat for the baby. The companies won't provide them.

This is no quick and mean feat even if you already had a car seat in the car as it\u2019d need to be removed, the straps adapted, and re installed for this infant\u2026 to only need re-doing for it\u2019s regular rider. So this \u2018asking for a lift\u2019 is a BIG ask.  \nI guess\u2026 offer a blanket? I\u2019d be wary of letting the rest in the warm of your home too :/", "NTA a cab will take them no problem even with a stroller and no car seat.  If it\u2019s that cold then one of them goes to the store and the other stays with at home with the baby.  In this day and age you can get groceries delivered for a small fee. There are so many solutions to their problem. Sounds like some fuckery to me.", "NTA. You don\u2019t have any obligation to do anything a complete stranger asks of you. In a perfect world, there would be no risk in driving them, but we don\u2019t live in a perfect world, nor do we have perfect people.", "One time at a state park, a kayaker asked us for a ride, saying his kayak was hung up somewhere. My husband was willing to give him a ride but I said, No. \nI felt guilty about it but better to be safe than sorry.", "NTA. I'm actually a forensic psychologist in my day job. And whilst this couple may have been genuine, this is also the VERY ploy we expect of criminals. You just can't risk it.  Maybe we could give them the benefit of the doubt on one or two things - but added all together, there was a lot to be suspicious about here. Always remember ANY type of crime can happen eventually, in ANY area. \n\nFirstly, it's a bit bizarre that a couple would be out with a BABY, in such cold weather, whilst underdressed. That could be part of the attempt to build sympathy (and as an aside, it doesn't matter if they really had a baby with them or not. Criminals absolutely use a real child at times, to gain sympathy and trust). \n\nMaybe we could give them the benefit of the doubt on that - but then there was the false claim about the bus waiting time. Do we REALLY believe they didn't read the (likely) bus timetable at the stop/online? They certainly seem to be CLAIMING to have read a timetable, by trying to (falsely) claim the next bus was in fact an hour away. \n\nMaybe they exaggerated the wait time to elicit sympathy, because they simply wanted out of the cold. But that doesn't stand up to scrutiny, either. Why not then simply take the imminent bus, if your motive was to get out of the cold? It seems strange they'd forego that immediate solution to their problems, in favour of searching (with a high risk of failure/longer delay) for a stranger to drive them - a random stranger who may well even be a theoretical threat TO THEM AND THEIR CHILD. Hell, they were even allegedly willing to freely give you their address. \n\nIt also somewhat suspicious they claimed no taxi would come, because of the stroller - absolutely many taxis accommodate strollers. Most could simply put it in the trunk. And indeed, what type of transport were you even in, to accommodate the stroller?! If it was just a standard car, it seems strange they'd assume a taxi couldn't ALSO accommodate a stroller. \n\nSo why would they again prefer a stranger's car (if they could even find a willing stranger), who may be a risk to them - rather than take a licensed taxi? All in all, there were a lot of holes in this young man's story. It's always suspicious, when the only possible 'solution' is you make yourself vulnerable (by letting them in your car). \n\nIt's not advised to take ANY stranger in your car, for any reason. A stranger with genuine intentions will understand your reluctance, and allow you to help in other ways (such as calling them a taxi, etc.) And if a stranger is in a dangerous situation with no other solution (such as stranded alone late at night), the police can be summoned to do a check on their safety.", "NTA\n\nI can't help wondering how they out out into a place where there's no effective public transport of taxis with a baby in tow.

I\u2019d also be inclined to say it\u2019s kind of their own fault, if you have a baby when you can\u2019t drive / don\u2019t have a car, you probably will end up waiting for buses.
