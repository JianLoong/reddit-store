Maybe they were legit or maybe not.", "NTA the stroller excuse doesn't make sense. Was it some ultra deluxe stroller that doesn't fold to be placed in a trunk? If so, I don't know how they would have gotten it on the bus either. That's really a them issue, and if you couldn't even see the baby I think you were right to trust your instincts.", "NTA. Human trafficking many times involves women and children as part of the ruse to gain trust. They could have gotten a cab or an Uber (strollers fold). You did the smart thing op. Don\u2019t second guess yourself.", "NTA this was a set up. Call uber. Ask you to call someone. Get on the first bus and stay warm at least on the way to the next stop and get closer to your home. Also plan and look at weather before heading out. \nI also maybe would have called the police for the safety of the child, if there was one.

Also from a safety perspective, did you have a car seat for their baby to use in your car? You were helpful in checking the bus schedule. You\u2019re not responsible for their choices.", "NTA it\u2019s a liability issue on your end and you don\u2019t know them. It sounds unnecessary of them to bring an entire family to grocery shop without a car in -10 weather in the first place. The baby should have been home in that weather.", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t feel comfortable having strangers in your car. You don\u2019t have to feel any obligation helping others if you don\u2019t feel safe. And since they apparently have a child, they should\u2019ve planned better their trip to the store.", "NTA. Other people's poor planning is not your problem to solve.  \nUber or Taxi would have required them to have a car seat for the baby. The companies won't provide them. It wasn't about the stroller, but the car seat.", "NTA. we live in a very dangerous world. i wouldn\u2019t have done it either. you can\u2019t just trust someone because they have a baby, babies have been used to prey on people before. if you felt something wasn\u2019t right and you didn\u2019t want to do it, that\u2019s fine. it could\u2019ve easily been a trap.", "NTA.\n\nNot your problem, they should've planned ahead.

Never give rides to strangers.", "NTA\n\nWhile maybe (or maybe not) they were just a friendly couple that needed a ride, there are a lot of situations where some people are pretending. You're not the asshole because you're taking precautions just in case.", "NTA. If it feels off, it\u2019s probably off.

And then there is of course the possibility that they are criminals and are using a baby as a way to disarm you.\n\nIf I felt extremely guilty I might order a UBER or equivalent for them since an UBER would have to take the stroller. Since they mentioned a taxi you might ask them to reimburse you in some way - Venmo or just cash since presumably they would have had taxi fare.", "Nta sounds sketchy, you aren\u2019t the only person they could ask. If they had a phone they could call a family member or something.", "NTA, there are red flags obviously, some that they could account for some maybe not. Things like did the temp drop faster than expected, spurring him to seek other transportation. Did he not have enough for a taxi or Uber but was too proud to say that, but was willing to give what he had to compensate for your gas, are all things that could be the case, or could not.
