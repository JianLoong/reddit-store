They didn't end up getting on the bus, I later found out that bus is one of two routes at that stop and that only goes to a local grocery store along the route.

Other people's poor planning is not your problem to solve.  \nUber or Taxi would have required them to have a car seat for the baby. The companies won't provide them.

Do not give rides to strangers especially when their story makes no sense. Years back on the night of Xmas Eve, my family and I were approached at a red light by a middle aged woman asking for a ride, with a story that also made no sense. We immediately sensed something was off and drove away. I still get chills remembering that moment and am so thankful we are okay. \n\nOn the other hand, I once spotted a couple and their baby caught in heavy rain on a long street with nowhere to get cover. They didn\u2019t ask for a a thing, but i felt worried for their baby so i pulled over and handed them a large umbrella I had. There are bad and sick people out there.

Here a baby can be in a taxi without a carseat, but if I were to drive a baby around that way I could be ticketed. It also seems odd they ended up by your place with groceries, a 20 minute drive from where they were going.", "Every bit of this story stinks. \n\n1. Taxis take strollers. Sure, they might not take you without a carseat, but that's not what the guy said. He said it was a stroller problem. \n\n2. If you do need a carseat, well, you still don't have one even if you use your car! That baby could still die in an accident!\n\n3. They could have just brought a carseat. There are carseat/stroller combos. When I have to take a taxi with my baby, I bring a carseat. Big PITA but my baby's not dead so it's worth it.\n\n4. They could have waited inside the nice, warm grocery store. \n\n5. Why bring the lady and baby at all? Seriously, who wants to haul a baby in a stroller in cold weather on a bus just to go grocery shopping? Give hubby the list and let him go. \n\nNow, do people sometimes plan poorly and have bad ideas? Absolutely. Dude could have been legit.

Bet the farm there was none.", "To me, aside from being approached *at your door by strangers*, the baby is what feels especially wrong about the situation.

No their saying if you need to go to the store in -10 it makes no sense to bring a kid. The wife and husband clearly aren't at work durring this so either could have stayed in shelter with the child.

You could have been robbed, raped, car-jacked, or possibly killed had you believed their messed-up story.
