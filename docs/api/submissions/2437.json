I went to see her last weekend and to take her out for our one year anniversary.  I wanted to take her somewhere nice so we went to a place my coworker recommended.

So I was surprised when we were asked to wait.  We went into the lounge and had a drink and waited.  About twenty minutes later the hostess came for us and we were seated.  It took a long time for the waiter to come for our order.  I was trying to have a good time but I was hungry.  We ordered straight off the menu. No substitutions or deletions. And then we waited.  We had another drink.  I asked the waiter about the food.  \"It'll be right out\".  I saw people that were seated after us get their meals. One hour after we sat. I had had enough.  I asked my girlfriend if she was comfortable if we left and she said she was waiting for me to suggest it.  \n\nSo I left money for the drinks on the table and we walked out.  The waiter saw us leaving and came over to ask us what the problem was.  I said that we had waited long enough and that we had other plans.  So we left.  We went to a chain steak restaurant and had a great meal.  My girlfriend thanked me for getting us out of the other place without a scene. The server asked about our evening and we told them. They brought us a complimentary dessert even though they and their restaurant did everything right.  I tipped very well 20% plus the cost of the dessert.  \n\nWhen I got back to work I told the guy who recommended the first place about the crap service and he said I was an asshole for walking out without paying for my food.  I never got any food. I don't think I'm wrong.

Not for leaving,  or expecting food to take less than an hour, but for not following up and giving them a chance to fix what was obviously a stuff up.   Really you should have said that you were getting sick of waiting and noticed that others were getting their food and you were considering leaving.  Mistakes happen but places can't fix it if they don't know.  To just sit meekly waiting and then try to sneak off isn't the right way to go about it.  Chances are no food was actually coming and so they're not out of pocket but it could have been a fair bit of waste for them.

Nothing special no extras) and we were told they forgot to place our order. It just got placed and will be out in 15 or less. It was. We stayed and ate thinking they might try to make it up to us?? Nope!! Bill in full after being stuck in a sticky booth for over two hours. Wish we walked out like we wanted to. And it cost extra cause we had to order more drinks than we expected to. \nWe still left over 20% because I can't not tip someone who works for basically the tips, especially the way the economy is now.", "[removed]", "Unless it\u2019s Hells Kitchen there\u2019s no reason to be waiting hour(s) for food", "if they are understaffed or for whatever reason one of the dishes ordered would take particularly longer they could and should just mention it upfront and suggest alternatives", "Happened to me in\u2010 get this- in a breakfast place in Mississippi. I was with my husband and his grandparents, and I kind of wanted to get loud and New Yorker on them, but Granny was getting tired and so instead we hurried her home.", "It is not always because of racism. Most of the time it is because the waitress/waiter is lazy, inexperienced or just an AH. I am white, and I have had to leave a restaurant because I saw how people who came after me were served first. And the server had tried to put me behind a column, (hidding me) and I said\"no way\". The restaurant was almost empty.", "I've tried that at a pizzaria. Lot of customers that day. The queue was a nightmare. The kitchen must have lost our order/not even written it down I guess? We waited 1.5 hours total. We only ordered one small box of fries. There were so many people. My friend was having anxiety and I was having a breakdown (also due to anxiety) behind one of their fridges. Wild times", "Why is this a copy of my comment but run through a bad thesaurus?", "You gave him a tip for forgetting about you? That\u2019s crazy.", "badbot", "Baddest of bots....", "In the end, the server bears the blame for this imo. Most likely, they got distracted and didn't put the order through; it happens to almost every server at least once. Regardless of whether this was the case (as it could've been a kitchen issue, but I find that less likely), your asking about your food should've cured the server to **actually check** that the order was sent, that it was in process, and an estimated ready time.", "Yeah, I mean just tell them before you're walking out the door is all.", "A new bot variation to beat the bots that track exact duplicates maybe? They're getting smarter.", "It\u2019s a bot account :) literally a few minutes old. I downvoted and report to spam, then harmful bots.", "Tipping culture is getting crazy.", "Sadly yes. I have worked for tips and know first hand that that particular struggle is most definitely real. I also understand that people make mistakes. I'm more pissed at the supervisor for not comping at least part of the meal for the long wait. Lesson learned though, we will never go back lol. My husband says even if the lesson is an expensive one it's better to pay to learn the first time than to ignore it and keep paying.", "No, they would have kicked him out after they closed, but he still would have paid and tipped", "Alternately - meal was made and left to sit, neither server nor runner ever took it to the table. Or a runner took it to the wrong table who said \u201cthis isn\u2019t what we ordered\u201d and the tray was returned and set to the side somewhere. The fault here is still entirely with the server for completely forgetting about one of their tables for an hour.", "Maybe they tried the old school tactic of making people wait so they would fill up time by ordering more drinks", "I\u2019m wondering if the op and/or his girlfriend are POC and the staff was racist?", "I go out a lot with my best friend, who has a Guide Dog. We've been refused service multiple times. That's honestly better than when we're shoved in an out of the way corner and our food is spat out of the kitchen in record pace. Think the fastest was apps, main meal and dessert in 40 minutes.  We get the message. You don't want us here. We just wanted a relaxing meal. Instead we feel like we're a nuisance. \n\nHer dogs are all organisation trained by a very well known org here in Oz. Has the name on the handle and everything. They tuck under the table and just sleep the whole time...dunno how that is more offensive than table 3 with the toddler watching Bluey at max volume whilst screaming and throwing cutlery.  (Yes, actual experience). We left. Complained to management. Never been back.", "bad bots", "Comment stealers I've seen before, but the weird google-translate-ass attempt to change the language was laughable.", "Can I recommend YouTuber Drew Talbert? His Bistro Huddy series is great, and a fun insight into his many years working as a server.", "oh my god, every chef I've ever worked with is getting shiver of horror down their spine right now like someone's walked over their grave\n\nlast restaurant I worked in, meals had to be off the pass within thirty seconds. they wouldn't serve anything that had been sitting under the warmer for like a minute. if it did, they had to remake it. an hour under the warmer, my god.\n\nthose are the times you really dont wanna pay the bill because it's ridiculous.", "Oh yeah how did I miss that one", "bah that's such bullsh\\*t, I didn't know it was a problem here in oz, I thought the guide dogs associations were so well known that it was respected. Booo.", ">fastest was apps, main meal and dessert in 40 minutes. \n\nMy eating out dream", "The only thing I can think of would be allergies? Even then though that's just such odd and disrespectful behaviour it's completely baffling.", "This one at least makes sense to me. It\u2019s still fucked up, but they\u2019re not discriminating against your friend as much as the dog. \n\nBut someone in a wheelchair is just so unobjectionable. I mean hell, they even bring their own seat!", "I have not served people with service dogs... mostly cuz I'm allergic to dogs, but I also asked if anyone can pick the table off of me, most of the time, my coworkers would forget so the poor people end up waiting for ages.. but also, I don't realy want to get close to the table and get a whole ass sneeze attack while I'm carrying the food to everyone..  I also felt bad for them cuz I obviously would go up to other people, and avoid their table like plague, which... I felt bad bout tbh, but apart from begging for someone to take the table,not much I could do bout it.", "Yeah, my guess is it\u2019s just the bot trying to avoid anyone noticing it\u2019s a copy because it\u2019s not word-for-word lol", "Now I picture a swan sliding gracefully and underwater his feet going as fast as a roadrunners \ud83d\ude04", "This is so true and I never knew how frantic it could be until I worked my first lunch rush \ud83e\udee0", "Haha this comment just reminded me of my days in uni working at a restaurant part time. I was a hostess and it was always a gong show every weekend from the  moment the customer steps in the door until they step out of it. All the staff just running around like crazy trying to make sure that everyone's fed and happy!", "If they'd just said the server or whatever had allergies we'd have found somewhere else to eat. It's Melbourne, not exactly a hard place to find somewhere to eat. Instead they just made us feel like we didn't deserve to have a nice evening out.", "He's still a mobility aid. Same as a chair. Or walking stick. He just happens to have fur. It's still discrimination and it's illegal.", "That's why it's so weird, nearly everywhere now seems to be able to accommodate in some form or another. \n\n I hope other places treat your friend better because everyone deserves a chill meal. Frankly I'm angry to hear that somewhere did that. I don't blame you for not going back, I hope most places are better though hearing about the refusals did make my blood boil a bit too.", "I never said otherwise?", "Yeah, but like, if someone is scared of dogs or are allergic to them, it's not illegal to avoid them. As much as I feel bad for your friend, due to my allergies, I would not get near your table. Although I would ask someone else to go to serve the table, but what happens after that is not on me.", "We've got a couple regular places we go to now. We're quiet, clean and tip well (when it's really not expected here in Oz), we really don't deviate much from these places, unless we've heard of another handler having a good experience somewhere else, then we'll try it. When you're wanting a nice lunch having to stand there and google the laws to show the manager/owner that they are, in fact, BREAKING the law, it rather puts a dampener on it.", "It shouldn't take that. I'm glad you have places to go though I hate to think how stressful that makes trying a new place, even if it's one you've heard good things from. Hopefully it gets better and places start, you know respecting the law and not being so pissy about it."]}
