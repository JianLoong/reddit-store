I went to see her last weekend and to take her out for our one year anniversary.  I wanted to take her somewhere nice so we went to a place my coworker recommended.  I looked it up and it had great reviews for food and service.  \n\nSo we went to see the Van Gogh experience and then out for dinner.  \n\nI had made a reservation and the restaurant was not busy at all.  So I was surprised when we were asked to wait.  We went into the lounge and had a drink and waited.  About twenty minutes later the hostess came for us and we were seated.  It took a long time for the waiter to come for our order.  I was trying to have a good time but I was hungry.  We ordered straight off the menu. No substitutions or deletions. And then we waited.  We had another drink.  I asked the waiter about the food.  \"It'll be right out\".  I saw people that were seated after us get their meals. One hour after we sat. I had had enough.  I asked my girlfriend if she was comfortable if we left and she said she was waiting for me to suggest it.  \n\nSo I left money for the drinks on the table and we walked out.  The waiter saw us leaving and came over to ask us what the problem was.  I said that we had waited long enough and that we had other plans.  So we left.  We went to a chain steak restaurant and had a great meal.  My girlfriend thanked me for getting us out of the other place without a scene. The server asked about our evening and we told them. They brought us a complimentary dessert even though they and their restaurant did everything right.  I tipped very well 20% plus the cost of the dessert.  \n\nWhen I got back to work I told the guy who recommended the first place about the crap service and he said I was an asshole for walking out without paying for my food.  I never got any food. I don't think I'm wrong. Even our appetizers never made it out of the kitchen.", "created_utc": 1668580940, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywm8fr/aita_because_i_walked_out_of_a_restaurant_without/", "score": 2088, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not for leaving,  or expecting food to take less than an hour, but for not following up and giving them a chance to fix what was obviously a stuff up.   Really you should have said that you were getting sick of waiting and noticed that others were getting their food and you were considering leaving.  Mistakes happen but places can't fix it if they don't know.  To just sit meekly waiting and then try to sneak off isn't the right way to go about it.  Chances are no food was actually coming and so they're not out of pocket but it could have been a fair bit of waste for them.

The proper thing to do, would have been to stop the waiter, or grab the manager, actually cancel your food, explain why, and then pay the bill for the drinks.\n\nHonestly, if the op talked to the manager, probably everything would have been comped anyway.\n\nGoing to say, op, is the ah... but just a mild one.", "There's a place in my city where all of the food reviews are only from people with last names from certain ethnicity.\n\nFor some reason my family tried it anyway and I ended up leaving the restaurant hungry.", "What role would \"allergies\" be playing here?", "My husband went to the bar to get our drinks. I know we shouldn't have tipped, but it was a packed Friday night and I felt bad. The waiter did apologize, repeatedly and at length, and funny thing as soon as they told us our order was out in no time...less than 15 minutes. I agree that he definitely dropped the ball...like you said how did he never come check if we wanted drinks? But I guess since my husband kept getting drinks from the bar, our glasses always looked full? Idk I'm making excuses, but even if my service is less than I feel bad if I don't tip. I don't know my servers circumstances and any number of things could be to blame, but some things just are and unless I know it was done on purpose or the server is really just an asshole, I feel like they earned a tip just for trying.", "Also a veteran server here, but in my 20s there was a BOH staff member that would threaten us if we asked him how long something would be. Like he once told me he was going to come from behind the line and slap me. I never felt safe enough to ask and I left asap. So, there's no telling what was going on behind the scenes.", "The way I read it was he tipped at the other place they went afterwards.\nOP only said he left money for the drinks in the post.\n\nEdit: nvm I can't read, didn't realize you meant it to the reply \ud83d\ude05", "The issue with places where tipping culture is a thing, is that in those places tips are literally how the person makes a living. They either don't get paid or get paid under minimum wage by the establishment simply because tips are considered part of their paycheck.\n\nWhen in a place that actually pays their servers, not giving them a tip wont change their paycheck and it doesn't feel like you have to leave a tip. In places where servers paycheck is 90-100% tips, even if their service is shit it feels like the right thing to do to leave a few dollars if not a 10%-20% tip just so that person is actually getting paid.\n\nAnd it sadly wont change until the places that allow servers to be not paid or barely paid change.", "tipped employees make slave wages\n\nnot defending it, just explaining it\n\nit speaks more about the management than it does the servers if they can't staff the place properly because they're greedy and want to overwork their workers instead of hiring enough or paying a living wage", "Yes lmao I'm not rude or wasteful.", "Especially when they said the restaurant was pretty quiet. I would never wait an hour for food. I tend to get hangry so might have eaten a waiter if my entrees weren't out in an hour", "You reminded me of a time when me an my wife were dating, we went to a bar in Myrtle Beach and ordered shots, they came out in Dixie cups.. wife though it was cute at first till she saw the glasses of the other couple we were with\u2026 actual shot glasses. We are a Hispanic couple and my freind was a white couple", "So you're saying that the server entered in all 9 of the meals sent it in hit fire and then went back 20 min later and then put in your food and hit fire just because you're a POC?\n\nI worked in the service industry for 15 years, that blows my mind that anyone would do that.  I can understand forgetting an order in a big group, or one meal gets fucked up and the kitchen needs to redo that, but to enter everything and then purposely not enter yours because you're a POC is crazy to me.\n\nWow, what an experience though, sorry that happened to you", "Not when it has happened to you several times.", "Happens", "No, it is not.", "Denny\u2019s has ended up paying out settlements more than once for it. It\u2019s sadly not as impossible as it should be.", "What, you think this doesn't actually happen IRL? You are very naive.", "They restaurant being short staffed, the waiter being really busy, aren\u2019t excuses for leaving a table without their meals while other tables (who were sat after them) get their food. OP isn\u2019t under any obligation to do anything but leave. It\u2019s clear the restaurant wasn\u2019t meeting their end of the deal by serving in a timely manner. OP paid for the drinks and left. He didn\u2019t stiff them. Calling OP an AH in any form is nonsense.", "Why do you highly doubt it? It happens to poc (especially black people) in \"fancy\" restaurants all the time", "You don't have to deal with them at all. You can check the computer to see if you rang the order in and the order time if you did. Then take it to the FOH manager and have them handle it. There is no way the solution is to avoid the table for over an hour.", "Tipping culture *is* crazy.", "Yeah i dont get this. Servers working for tips means that they get paid based on their performance, forgetting your order is not good performance at all, and shouldnt be rewarded", "I was a server for 25 years. I know what it's like to work for tips. That being the case, when I go out to eat I expect the same level of service I would give my own customers.. and I tip accordingly. Forget to put in my order? NO way in hell are you getting more than a $2 tip if I've waited for my food for more than an hour because you forgot. Actions have consequences.", "If you forget me and don\u2019t put in my meal, I don\u2019t care if it\u2019s part of your pay check or not you aren\u2019t getting a tip.", "I live in a town where strawberries is the biggest export during summer. Those who come to pick are usually from other countries where workers get paid less, so when they come to us for the month strawberries are in season, they are very motivated to work, and since they get paid by how much they pick, this works in favor of both the owner and the pickers. The fastest pickers are able to earn upwards of 40$ and hour, but they have to be fast, and precise with what they pick to be able to achieve that high of a wage.\n\nIf they are slow and imprecise, then they cant expect to be paid well, so why should servers who rely on tips for their wage?\n\nIm not saying that tipping culture is good, quite the opposite, but you also have to look at the current situation they are in and act accordingly", "This is a generalization. There are plenty of places that have tipping culture that don\u2019t have a separate minimum wage. See: the whole west coast of the USA. Here you make probably $17 an hour from your employer plus tips. I\u2019ve known servers who average $60 an hour through the tourist season.", "> in those places tips are literally how the person makes a living.\n\nThat's not a reason for rewarding incompetence.", "Not getting money for not doing his job seems about right to me.", "It's illegal in Oz! Definitely report cafes etc when it occurs. There's a proper discrimination reporting line but I can't recall sorry. Makes me crazy when guide dogs are bloody amazing. I'm sorry to hear that occurs to them so much \ud83d\ude14", "Devils advocate, maybe they ran out of clean glasses?  I've had to do this as a bartender when we've had an absolute full house and you don't have the glassware. \n\nBut honestly so sorry to you guys if that was not the case and it was just racism.  That's so gross.", "Wow!  Well, that explains my experience when I was a kid. I used to go to Denny's all the time with my mom though usually, it was later in the day. One day my mom and I went for breakfast as a little 'Mommy and Daughter time'. We pulled up and got seated relatively quickly but we didn't get any menus and we sat for an *hour*. No drinks, nothing, just waited for an hour for service. Once the hour was up my mom was furious and took my hand and walked right out while ignoring the servers trying to ask us questions, only yelling that we've been waiting here for an hour and that's ridiculous as the place was entirely empty with one only elderly duo that were the 'right' color so they weren't busy in the slightest to have us waiting for menus for an hour.\n\nFortunately, there was an IHop right next door; somehow they just knew. They had seen us walk out and gave us from what I remember excellent service. I think we got something on the house like a dessert or something? We never went back to Denny's after that despite it having previously been one of our favorite dining places and IHop was held to high regard in our household.", "But could it just as easily been the kitchen that missed the order? As in the server may have done the right thing and it got lost in the kitchen?", "I wasn't saying servers should not do their job and still get paid. I said that it FEELS like the right thing to do even if the service was shit because that is basically the only way those people get paid.\n\nThey should still do their job, and if something happens where they screw up then they, and management if it's a bigger issue, need to react accordingly. If they don't, then they shouldn't get tipped.\n\nI was just explaining why some people FEEL like they NEED to tip even with shit service.", "Never said it was. I said it FEELS like the right thing to do even if the service was shit.", "There are places that have exceptions (like cat cafes) but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s illegal/ classed as discrimination here in Australia to refuse service like that", "The devil doesn\u2019t need an advocate, if they ran out of clean glasses they could do this fancy thing with some dirty ones involving soap and water\u2026", "If, after 30 minutes, APPETIZERS haven't come out for a table, that's when you ask the kitchen where the fuck the food is. Then you find out if they don't have the order. Then you fix it, apologize to the table and comp their appetizers at the very least. You don't do not one thing until the customer complains 1-2 hours later.", "Meep meep.\n\n\nOr would it be honk honk in this case?", "Im not trying to argue with anyone, I wasn't there I don't know the situation but I will say that SOMETIMES you are SO BUSY in a restaurant that you do not even have dirty glasses to clean and that ALL YOU HAVE is the plastic cups.\n\nI have had to do that bartending MULTIPLE times.\n\n I was just offering that as an explanation that isn't involving racism, but again, I wasn't there I don't know if they had clean glasses and I don't know your experience and if they did have clean glasses and you saw them and they refused to give give to you then that's fucking ridiculous."]}
