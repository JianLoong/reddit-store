I went to see her last weekend and to take her out for our one year anniversary.  I wanted to take her somewhere nice so we went to a place my coworker recommended.  I looked it up and it had great reviews for food and service.  \n\nSo we went to see the Van Gogh experience and then out for dinner.  \n\nI had made a reservation and the restaurant was not busy at all.  So I was surprised when we were asked to wait.  We went into the lounge and had a drink and waited.  About twenty minutes later the hostess came for us and we were seated.  It took a long time for the waiter to come for our order.  I was trying to have a good time but I was hungry.  We ordered straight off the menu. No substitutions or deletions. And then we waited.  We had another drink.  I asked the waiter about the food.  \"It'll be right out\".  I saw people that were seated after us get their meals. One hour after we sat. I had had enough.  I asked my girlfriend if she was comfortable if we left and she said she was waiting for me to suggest it.  \n\nSo I left money for the drinks on the table and we walked out.  The waiter saw us leaving and came over to ask us what the problem was.  I said that we had waited long enough and that we had other plans.  So we left.  We went to a chain steak restaurant and had a great meal.  My girlfriend thanked me for getting us out of the other place without a scene. The server asked about our evening and we told them. They brought us a complimentary dessert even though they and their restaurant did everything right.  I tipped very well 20% plus the cost of the dessert.  \n\nWhen I got back to work I told the guy who recommended the first place about the crap service and he said I was an asshole for walking out without paying for my food.  I never got any food. I don't think I'm wrong. Even our appetizers never made it out of the kitchen.", "created_utc": 1668580940, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ywm8fr/aita_because_i_walked_out_of_a_restaurant_without/", "score": 251, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Took like 10 minutes to just get drinks and our food never came and it was getting close to close.

You've mentioned asking for the food once, and then only telling the wait staff you are leaving because they happened to see you leaving - ie you were going to leave without saying anything.  Tbh, and I'm going to get downvoted here, but I think the way you went about it YTA.  Not for leaving,  or expecting food to take less than an hour, but for not following up and giving them a chance to fix what was obviously a stuff up.   Really you should have said that you were getting sick of waiting and noticed that others were getting their food and you were considering leaving.  Mistakes happen but places can't fix it if they don't know.  To just sit meekly waiting and then try to sneak off isn't the right way to go about it.  Chances are no food was actually coming and so they're not out of pocket but it could have been a fair bit of waste for them.  I'm not saying what they did was ok, but given you don't know why it was going wrong it was an AH way to deal with it.", "I don't think he expected me to pay for the food.
