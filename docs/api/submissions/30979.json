If he was calling you his girlfriend and you are not, in fact, his girlfriend, that's pretty fucking creepy.", "NTA\n\nSociety expects (and teaches to) young girls to always be kind, polite and submissive, and this is how we end up used and abused. Good job standing up for yourself.", "You did the right thing.  Always stand up for yourself and embarrass creeps  when they creep.  NTA", "NTA \n\nI had the exact same thing happen when I was around your age. Some boy kept calling me his girlfriend, and I shut it down immediately.", "NTA\n\nListen regardless of age, having someone calling you their girlfriend when you have no relationship is always a red flag. Could have you been nicer? Yes. But girls are always expected to be non-confrontational in regards to feeling uncomfortable. I would recommend getting a teacher involved cause Emmet needs a corse correction.", "NTA.  Sounds like Emmett was being a creep.", "NTA and your friend is an idiot", "NTA. It is creepy and inappropriate for him to say that, and he absolutely should be called out for it \n\nHe played a dumb game, now he won a stupid prize.", "NTA. As others have said he IS a creep and IS fucking disturbing", "NTA. This guy was 100% being creepy and him lying about you should not be tolerated.", "nta. if it walks like a creep, calls random classmates his gf like a creep, sticks up for creeps like a creep\u2026 your friend is wrong, and should feel bad. emmet is creepy, and should stay away from you.", "Baby... creep is not a cuss word... but it IS fact... I had a guy like that in my life, called me his GF during HS, he stalked me for 6 months before I found out. Protect yourself. Call him a creep. And if THAT'S all you did, you're fine.\n\nsorry. EDIT. adding a \"it's fuckin disturbing is NOT a bad thing. It was how you felt... You were sharing your feelings. NOW I realize why you were in trouble for a cuss. I thought she got mad you called him a creep. sorry.", "NTA. I agree with almost everything people have said. I\u2019d like to add that this can also help him learn and grow in these formative years.", "NTA.  If Emmett doesn\u2019t want to be treated like a creep, he should are being a creep.", "Gonna go NTA on the whole calling him out thing. I will say that since this is (presumably) the first time this has come up, you probably could have just confronted him about it without immediately slinging insults . . . but I probably would have reacted the same way when I was 15, so I understand. On the plus side, hopefully this will help him learn very quickly to not make up lies about other people.", "NTA, he sounds like a homophobic asshole to be honest here", "Creepy guy that's how o stalkers start, be safe and try to always be on very safety places", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
