Good job standing up for yourself.", "You did the right thing.  Always stand up for yourself and embarrass creeps  when they creep.

Some boy kept calling me his girlfriend, and I shut it down immediately.", "NTA\n\nListen regardless of age, having someone calling you their girlfriend when you have no relationship is always a red flag. Could have you been nicer? Yes. But girls are always expected to be non-confrontational in regards to feeling uncomfortable. I would recommend getting a teacher involved cause Emmet needs a corse correction.", "NTA.  Sounds like Emmett was being a creep.", "NTA and your friend is an idiot", "NTA. It is creepy and inappropriate for him to say that, and he absolutely should be called out for it \n\nHe played a dumb game, now he won a stupid prize.", "NTA. As others have said he IS a creep and IS fucking disturbing", "NTA. This guy was 100% being creepy and him lying about you should not be tolerated.", "nta. if it walks like a creep, calls random classmates his gf like a creep, sticks up for creeps like a creep\u2026 your friend is wrong, and should feel bad. emmet is creepy, and should stay away from you.", "Baby... creep is not a cuss word... but it IS fact... I had a guy like that in my life, called me his GF during HS, he stalked me for 6 months before I found out. Protect yourself. Call him a creep. And if THAT'S all you did, you're fine.\n\nsorry. EDIT. adding a \"it's fuckin disturbing is NOT a bad thing. It was how you felt... You were sharing your feelings. NOW I realize why you were in trouble for a cuss. I thought she got mad you called him a creep. sorry.", "NTA. I agree with almost everything people have said. I\u2019d like to add that this can also help him learn and grow in these formative years.", "NTA.  If Emmett doesn\u2019t want to be treated like a creep, he should stop being a creep.", "Gonna go NTA on the whole calling him out thing. I will say that since this is (presumably) the first time this has come up, you probably could have just confronted him about it without immediately slinging insults . . . but I probably would have reacted the same way when I was 15, so I understand. On the plus side, hopefully this will help him learn very quickly to not make up lies about other people.", "NTA, he sounds like a homophobic asshole to be honest here", "Creepy guy that's how o stalkers start, be safe and try to always be on very safety places", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Did he have reason to think you were? If not then NTA.", "NTA.\nwhat you said is kinda description of a creep. You called him by his name? Boohoo. He is fckn stranger who thinks he is with a girl he doesn't even know very well (or at all). That's damn creepy.", "NTA. You're not his girlfriend. You have a girlfriend.

Good for you for standing up for yourself, it is weird especially cause you don\u2019t know him.", "NTA\n\nI'm sorry you've learned what most women know: boys and men will defend creeps, declare the girl or woman the bad one for stating facts, standing up for herself, and/or for the way she stood up for herself.

If not, do you find it creepy when dudes call random girls theirs? I do.\n\nHe's creepy. Nta", "NTA.\n\nI\u2019m sure Emmett is definitely creepy, probably due to his looks. I\u2019m sure if he was one of the cool cute guys in High School and he did the same thing: it wouldn\u2019t be creepy at all.", "NAH, oh to be young again lol. Cussing him out is fine, he probably lied to people/ hisfriends for clout (which is immature but hardly unheard of for a teenage boy), and your friend has your best interests at heart. Resolving conflict without escalating it is preferable, but you're young and it's understandable considering the context.\n\nYou can probably just let it drop, but if you still feel bad you can apologize not for the content but how it was said. You can say you're sorry for swearing at him, but re-affirm that what he's been saying is not acceptable and that he has to stop. The nice thing about it is that it's great to clear the air with someone (which can make that small amount of interaction less awkward), and it gives you another chance to talk about the issue with clearer heads. You can really let them know why their behavior was unacceptable, how it made you feel, etc, and it has the potential to turn into a moment of growth for both parties.\n\nIn either case I wouldn't stress too much about this particular incident unless you have to. Take care!", "NTA but if you want genuine respect from everyone around you should handle it in a mature and adult manner. Yes you are 15 but cussing people out over something relatively trivial does have the potential to make you seem like the asshole. What you should do in future circumstances is be more assertive in a calm and collected manner. Respond logically always. Not emotionally. This is the way. If he keeps doing it, then you go to teachers or other staff, let them know the situation, get yours and his parents involved and let them handle it like adults. He may be childish but there is no need to stoop down to his level. In the adult world you cannot do that in the work place, you must be professional and respectful, and take it to something like HR or your manager, etc\u2026 yes you\u2019re 15 but becoming mature and showing maturity is a must as you grow up, being mature and collected will get you much further in every aspect of life as opposed to immature and explosive. Good on you for standing up for yourself, I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t do it, but handle it in the most reasonable ways possible. This could even give him more drive to keep doing it because he saw a reaction out of you and may continue to target you in the future purely for entertainment.", "You acted as if you could catch a disease from his presence and that he was not worthy of any respect. I\u2019m sorry but you never need to address anyone with this kind of hatred towards them", "Yta get a grip", "don't listen to NTAs they are here cuz you're a girl you see you could also tell him to stop doing that by a joke or sth without sabotaging or embarrassing him in front of the others maybe he was down so bad but he didn't say anything sexual or gross at all", "Yta/nta it\u2019s weird to pinpoint because if he was telling everyone then nta but if he only said it to his friends and only his friends then yta", "Sounds like 15 year old problems. Did you get cooties too?", "nta, I had a similar experience a while ago and had a way worse reaction to the guy, calling someone your partner when you barely even know each other is disgusting", "NTA. When I (M) was your age I did some creepy shit to a (F) classmate without really knowing better, and it took too long afterwards for me to realize it. I'm sure it would've stung for it to be called out, but in retrospect that would've been way better to find out the hard way than risk doing it again.  Some of us need a harsh course correction sometimes.", "NTA, would maybe not publicly shame him but would be very clear that you do not like him and are not in a relationship with him, calling him a creep and saying that what he did is disturbing is a normal reaction but bullying him for what he did after clearing up his lie might be a bit more AH move.", "NTA \n\nStay far away from him. That\u2019s absolutely creep behavior and if he doesn\u2019t want to be called a creep, he shouldn\u2019t act like one.", "NTA.  There is this expectation that women have to always be nice, non confrontational, and let down creeps easy no matter how they act.  You don\u2019t.  You did nothing wrong by calling him out.  He is a creep.", "NTA omg. i can\u2019t believe people in high school pull that stuff still. like all throughout middle school i had a guy convinced we were dating bc we were friends, if that. he thankfully was held back so i escaped him after 8th grade.\n\nbut it was so bad his GRANDMOTHER would call and try to get me to talk to him. my mom started answering and telling her i wasn\u2019t home, or i was with family, anything. one of my cousins and i went with my mom to work, where the grandmother CALLED MY COUSIN and i\u2019m still not sure how the fuck she got that number\u2026", "innit, proper weird", "I once got accused of calling someone my girlfriend when I wasn't. The thing is that about a dozen people all said I was saying it when I hadn't said that at all. It was a huge issue for me and brought back a ton of trust issues. My theory is my boss made it up so I'd stop talking to her during my shift. Her boyfriend even threatened me physically despite the fact i hadn't said shit. Really lost a lot of respect for people that week.", "Yeah sure, and boys go to jail for looking at a woman wrong.", "I was literally going to comment your first two phrases. \n\nThere is absolutely nothing morally wrong with calling someone you don\u2019t know, who is claiming to be your partner, a creep.

I know plenty of guys who give a damn about their education and some girls who couldn\u2019t care less. I also know that girls were literally not allowed to go to school for the longest time.

And even if it *did* have anything to do with gender, by your logic, boys simply don't give a shit about education, and so by your logic it makes perfect sense that more boys would choose *not* to pursue higher education. Even many boys who *were* favored in the education system would still refrain from attending college because, yet again by your own logic, they *still wouldn't give a shit about school*.", "This shows how many people of different genders are in each program, but there's no explanation of why. The grandparent comment to yours claims there are fewer men going to college because of how education treats men. Your table doesn't address that.", "I\u2019m not agreeing or disagreeing, but personal experience means nothing when we are talking about billions of people.", "True, but it sounds like the person i\u2019m replying to is also basing it off personal experience, as well. You\u2019re right, personal experience is not enough to make a claim. However, the person I\u2019m replying to is acting like their experience is universal, and I disproved it since my experience contradicted with his. The reason why I\u2019m getting the sense that it\u2019s just his experience is that he never put forth evidence (like an article or something) to go with his statement."]}
