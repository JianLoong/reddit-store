What do you want me to do - *lie*?\u2019 because to people like that, being \u2018honest\u2019 is a cover for being an AH & trying not to hurt other people\u2019s feelings is either too much effort or seen as a lie.

Read the room.", "YTA Your fiance is giving you the greatest gift possible, carrying your child, and you insult her. Go apologize and tell her it frightens you and that's why you blurted that out. Of course it's gross, but it's also amazing.  You don't have to look if blood makes you squeamish.  That wouldn't (or shouldn't) hurt her feelings.  Just make sure she knows it's your inability to handle it rather than you thinking she is disgusting.", " It is okay to feel that way.

You don't have to make her think you feel giving birth is nasty by literally saying \"it's nasty.\"\n\nApologize and tell her that you've seen videos on birth and you know you won't be able to handle what they looks like and that instead of being one of the men who faints and pulls staff's attention away from her, you'd rather be next to her face encouraging and supporting her. And be prepared to do whatever she needs postpartum. Even if it's not pretty.

She didn\u2019t ask you if you thought childbirth was nasty to warrant you needing to give her that truth. She asked if you were gonna look.

You\u2019re more of a dumbass.", "YTA - How you feel is valid, but you should work on filtering your thoughts before you open your mouth. The last thing your fianc\u00e9 needed to hear was a judgmental comment about how her body is going to look \"nasty\" bringing forth your child into the world. Labor is painful and ya know deadly enough on its own. Now she's probably concerned about how disgusting she is going to look to you. These types of statements erode the connection and trust in a relationship.", "YTA. Some things you just keep to yourself.

One everyone knows how the giving birth isnt pretty, but she is putting herself through something that's going to take every ounce of her strength to give the both of you something amazing.

I got mad just reading this", "That's the spirit", "And what you DID was say something unnecessarily rude and hurtful to your fianc\u00e9e.", "This is your first long term relationship isn\u2019t it? Because you don\u2019t seem to realize it but she\u2019s going to leave you in the next few years if you don\u2019t learn to edit what comes out of your mouth", "Will you? Is your fianc\u00e9 going to take you into the birth or someone else that puts her first in that moment? Don\u2019t be too surprised if she\u2019s having doubts about you being at the birth.", "Exactly", "My 3 year threw up directly into my face. It went into my eyes. Turns out stomach juices really sting.", "My 1 year old ended up projectile vomiting milk all over me in bed. She was still breastfed at the time.\n\nI have no idea how on earth I ended up in a puddle of milk.  That stuff was cartoon-like.  There's no way her stomach held that much milk, nor my boobs.  Yet there we were, in a literal puddle of regurgitated milk.\n\nIt still confuses me to this day.", "My first daughter was about 2 when she got the flu. She had just woke up from her nap and I could tell she didn't feel good. She walked over to me and instantly I could tell what was coming. I cupped my hands together and managed to catch most of her vomit in my hands. Didn't really gross me out, actually I was pretty proud of myself for catching it, lol", "My twins finger painted the windows with poop one morning when they woke up before we did. \n\nAnother time while I was working, their dad was supposed to be watching them. I came home from work at 2pm, to him gagging and spraying stuff down with the garden hose. \n\nI asked what happened, he had fallen back to sleep while the girls were awake, and had pooped. So they took off their shitty diapers, and rode their little leg powered 4-wheelers, all over the house painting with poop! \n\nThis was the last time I left them alone in their dad's care.", "The midwives asked if I wanted to have a mirror and watch my son be delivered, my reply was \"no that's gross\".", "Your husband is a BAMF", "This is kind to your wife, the delivery team, and to yourself.", "Childbirth is physically gross. So is like our entire set of interal organ systems. lol. \n\nRegardless, this isn\u2019t a debate about whether or not expelling a fetus from your body is a kosher experience.\n\nThis is about READING THE ROOM.\nOP: YTA.", "Speaking as a mother, pregnancy is NOT the time for brutal honesty. His gf literally has more estrogen pumping through her body than she would otherwise produce in HER WHOLE LIFE. It's like PMS on steroids. I remember balling my eyes out at a McDonald's commercial. Either she's newly pregnant (which is an odd time to be talking delivery plans) or he's TA for not figuring out by this point that he needs to be more careful with his words.", "What a stupid stretch to go from the unholy mess that is childbirth to a scratched knee \ud83d\ude44", "Dude. \n\nPeople vasovagal and pass out from seeing needles and blood ALL. THE. TIME. If you're squeamish about blood, don't expose yourself to so much of it in what is already a process (childbirth) that is so inherently risky.\n\nThe medical staff don't need dad fainting and banging his head or breaking his nose next to his labouring wife.\n\nNow if you faint next to your kid at home cause he showed you his owie from falling off his tricycle, fine...just wake up 1 min later and bandaid your kid and yourself but labour suite is a terrible place to faint.\n\nAlso lol no, parents aren't allowed into surgery during actual surgery to watch it. They can go in and prep the kid till anasthetic kicks in then they get gently kicked out.", "Friendly reminder that a vasovagal response (passing out in response to the sight of blood) is really common and completely involuntary. In fact, last time I had to get a blood test, I suddenly had one *out of nowhere*. I've had hundreds of blood tests and been fine - but that time, for whatever reason, I lost consciousness.\n\nIf you're gonna say *anyone* who reacts badly to blood shouldn't have kids, you're basically saying the entire human population shouldn't have kids. We are *designed* to react badly to blood, because in nature, seeing blood is always bad. Literally any person could suddenly have a vasovagal response out of nowhere, and by your logic they're now disqualified from ever having kids. It's kind of a silly standard to set, buddy.", "Every time someone got hurt or I saw blood my knees would ache, I would get woozy/nearly pass out in some cases and I can\u2019t listen to stories involving blood or being hurt. The knees aching is fucking weird, I know. The same thing would happen to my dad too. \n\nBut as soon as I had kids that all stopped. So far *touch wood* no one has injured themselves badly. There\u2019s still plenty of time and with their fathers history it\u2019s just a matter of time, unfortunately. \n\nThis time last year I did see my mum break her ankle and her bone was almost through the skin. I didn\u2019t freak out, I was just worried about looking after her and making her comfortable until the ambulance got there and getting my screaming baby/toddlers away from her.", "Generally women can handle blood, but lots of men faint. It's apparently an evolutionary adaptation, (I'm super unclear on how it was selected for because it seems dangerous) but it is definitely out of their control. So usually mom ends up dealing with the injuries while dad tries his best not to look.", "I really struggle dealing with my kids injuries, but I go into auto pilot, deal with it, get them sorted and then have to lie down before I faint - and if my husband is here he\u2019ll take over and deal with them as he knows I get squeamish. Doesn\u2019t make me an unfit parent as I power through and put them first regardless. It\u2019s weird though as I was never like this before I had them, I\u2019d get squeamish at my own injuries but could easily help others - my mum was very sick when I was growing up and had several major operations, I changed dressings, cleaned wounds, hell I even changed her colostomy bags and tended to her stoma, but there\u2019s no way I could do that now. It\u2019s not a voluntary reaction - I wish it didn\u2019t happen but it\u2019s not like I can change it.", "Saying they can't see blood was the polite excuse about why they're not going to be watching anything below the shoulders during childbirth. Because of how gross it is.", "That's really funny because if you go through the comments you can actually find multiple women discussing how they s*** themselves during birth and I actually am a woman so you think I'd know about these sort of things especially when my mother said are you sure you want to have a kid at 18 cuz. You cannot look it up if you're that dense to make s*** up and try to act like you know how this works then be my guest to go ahead and embarrass yourself. It's common knowledge amongst those who have actually given birth and those who have sat in for them like I said in for my last two youngest siblings that women s*** themselves they actually put down extra paper to be able to wipe the s*** away as the birth happens. if you ever watch an animal give birth they too shit themselves.", "Ahh, the cottage cheese vom. It's such a delight.", "This! 100% this! Why did she ask him? That seems so weird to me. If she didn\u2019t want the truth, she shouldn\u2019t have asked.", "Is. Sparta!", "My mother did the same thing to my younger sibling one Christmas morning back when we were young kids. It took my like eight year old brain a second to register what happened as my mom was already running to the sink lmfao. Superhero powers you guys have <3", "Indeed, please activate your brain to mouth filter!\nYes, it maybe gross. But you don't say that to your pregnant wife!!!", "I delivered by Caesarian 10 weeks ago and although there was no poop, oh my gosh the blood. No one tells you about or prepares you for just how much you will bleed.", "I was asked if I wanted a laxative long before the actual birthing part of the birth. Much less nasty, in my opinion!", "They used to make you have an enema while you were in labor to avoid that", "WTF THERES POOP!?!?!!?", "Not always\u2026had 2 babies and didn\u2019t poop! \ud83e\udd72 \ud83c\udf40", "Not really... l had 3 kids, 3 times no poop. My husband would've deffinitly told me. Maybe when you have to push for a fair bit, the longest l pushed was 5 minutes. They all came pretty quick.", "I never pooped", "Not always, but definitely a pretty good chance!", "When my brothers baby was born he passed out twice. They told him if he passed out again he'd be kicked out of the delivery room", "Literally happened to me recently, for the first time ever. I have to get blood tests all the time for my chronic condition; never ever had a problem. I even have a system down - look away when the needle goes in (because I have a needle phobia), sit through the draw, then turn around to examine the vials like they need me to. \n\nLast time I got one, I passed out the second I turned around to look at the vials. Had never happened to me before. For some reason, it did that day. So yeah, it really can happen to *anyone*, at any time, even if you don't have a history of that. \n\nMy partner *is* known to faint at blood, on and off (usually his own), so if we had kids I'd be totally fine with him staying right up by my head so he can't see anything. And I'd probably bring a backup support person, just in case it really got bad. Because you're right, during labour is *not* the time for that.", "My friend is exactly the same. If I even say ouch, I cut myself, every time I hear \"ow my knees,\" and she almost collapses. I've learned not to tell her any time I hurt myself now, even for the most minor injuries", "My comment was completely sarcastic. I have given birth 3 times so I'm completely aware of everything that occurs during childbirth. Although I did not poop during childbirth I'm aware a lot of women do. And, actually you can look up information on childbirth, both at the library and online. That was the only part of my comment that wasn't sarcasm. I am not sure how you missed how obviously sarcastic I was being with almost my entire comment... I'm thinking maybe I'm not the dense one", "How does it come out with such force!? :D", "Friend of mine had her kid projectile shit into the drawer full of his clean clothes on the other side of the room.\n\nLet's hear it for extra laundry!", "Good times.", "Wait until he has to change a diaper...", "True. If you don\u2019t have to push, you probably won\u2019t poop. C-section mamas are amazing! The recovery alone is so hardcore.", "Yep my mrs had a c section and I helped her out of bed back on the ward a few hrs later to take her to the nicu to see kid and was very shocked by the blood covered mess that was under her", "YeH!!", "I am exactly the same lol. Never wanted them and the thought is just yuk lol. 10/10 for anyone going though childbirth!", "Lol! Your poor brother! I can't imagine how they worded that. \"Sir, we're going to need you to CONTROL yourself or you'll be excused.\" But also, the poor hospital staff trying to safely deliver the baby and care for the mother while having the husband keep collapsing on them. Just poor everyone!", "When my mom was giving birth to me, the doctor asked if she wanted my dad in the delivery room. She said \u201cnot unless you want to see a 6\u20195\u201d man pass out on the floor\u201d and he was happy as a clam sitting out in the waiting room because that\u2019s exactly what he would have done - pass out.", "My mother decided before hand that my father would be better of in the waiting room \ud83e\udd23. She knew he would have a hardtime with all the bodily fluids. In the end I was delivered with a c section and my father got to hold me as soon as I was checked.", "This made me laugh so hard! \ud83d\ude02 \"Ow, my knee\"! Wahahaha!", "Yeah, no idea, but that was not a fun night (we made sure to not have carpet in the changing areas in our next home lmao)", "Your friend wins the internet for today.", "I remember telling my husband that women are warriors. The c-section recovery was admittedly brutal - the worst pain of my life, and mine was uncomplicated. \u2764\ufe0f", "I declared it at age 12 and 10 years later i still feel the same even if people invalidate you\n\nA lot of people just assume that \"young\" people say this on a whim without ever thinking about anything or having reasons. I think kids can be cute and would love a close relationship with my nieces and nephews. But I don't want to be a mom. The only people that should have kids are those that really want them and not were forced to keep them due to their partner/family/laws/religion/society. The kid will feel that their mother didn't want them even when you give your best to love and take care of them and it damages kids. So rather than putting a kid and me through that nor having is the better choice for everyone\n\nEdit: additional information", "32 was the age i had my tubes tied because I never wanted kids. 20 years later: Still the best decision of my life!", "You *are* a warrior!", "My wife had a C-section and was up and about less than 2 hours later. She wanted to use the bathroom \ud83d\ude02. Hats off to her, she didn't complain much, mainly I was whilst driving due to the crap condition of the roads.", "I have two nephews and a niece to constantly remind me why I do not want children. They are 16 months through almost 8 years. There\u2019s been a colic-y baby, the giggler to the point of screamer, and the all out screaming for the sake of screaming baby. Any desire for children is now dead, cremated, and buried 3x.", "We didn't need to wait for the first nappy - my girly pooed on exit so it was all over my belly while she was still attached to me \ud83d\ude43", "Oh yes, people have said, \u201cYou\u2019ll change your mind.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll find someone and want kids.\u201d\n\n32. Single. Have 2 nephews and 1 niece. All the \u201cglory\u201d and \u201cbeauty\u201d of children has not been found. I have found 100,000 more reasons to not have them.", "Oh! I used to hear that all the time. Since I was 12 I have said that I love kids but I do not wish to have any of my own and I definitely do not want to go through childbirth. Everyone in my family told me you are young you will change your mind. I heard that when I was 18, when I was 20, 25, 28 ... after I got married and still said the same thing they kept on telling me how I will change my mind and feel differently. Almost 7 years married, 35 years old, haven't changed my mind yet. Now people, including my mum and MIL say that I am making the wrong decision and later in life when I won't have the option of having children anymore I will regret my decision. Idk, perhaps I will, but I don't right now and I don't think it is right to bring a child into this world just cause I might regret not having children later in life.", "So are you! \u2764\ufe0f", "Phew, two hours!? That's intense. I had an emergency c-section and was bed-bound for the first 18-ish hours, I think. I managed to get out of bed to shower, but my husband had to help me/wash me because standing was so painful (admittedly, the midwives forgot to give me pain relief before I did it). I can't even imagine being able to do that - your wife is rockstar!", "Yeah, I wish I was joking. Around half hour after we got back to the ward she was like \"I can wiggle my toes.\" Was really weird seeing all the ladies in there with different pain thresholds post c section"]}
