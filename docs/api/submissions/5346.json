What do you want me to do - *lie*?\u2019 because to people like that, being \u2018honest\u2019 is a cover for being an AH & trying not to hurt other people\u2019s feelings is either too much effort or seen as a lie.

Our body feels like its being ripped out with a dull knife. Shut up and find comforting words. She's scared to. It hurts like hell, and we're scared to death. Shut up and be the adult she needs you to be. My husband didn't want to look, but once he saw that big ass head come out, he had more compassion for me in my recovery.  Yall don't be acting like your dick hurts as much as a big headed baby.", "YTA for your wording. Read the room.", "YTA Your fiance is giving you the greatest gift possible, carrying your child, and you insult her. Go apologize and tell her it frightens you and that's why you blurted that out. Of course it's gross, but it's also amazing.  You don't have to look if blood makes you squeamish.  That wouldn't (or shouldn't) hurt her feelings.  Just make sure she knows it's your inability to handle it rather than you thinking she is disgusting.", " It is okay to feel that way. But you can express it in a better manner than saying it is nasty.

You don't have to make her think you feel giving birth is nasty by literally saying \"it's nasty.\"\n\nApologize and tell her that you've seen videos on birth and you know you won't be able to handle what they looks like and that instead of being one of the men who faints and pulls staff's attention away from her, you'd rather be next to her face encouraging and supporting her. And be prepared to do whatever she needs postpartum. Even if it's not pretty. Suck it up.", "I GUESS N-T-A for thinking its gross as some people can\u2019t stomach medical imagery but YTA for calling it nasty to her face.\n\n\nAlso your little \u201cwas I supposed to lie to her?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just being honest\u201d is such \u201cI just keep it real\u201d immature high school bs. She didn\u2019t ask you if you thought childbirth was nasty to warrant you needing to give her that truth. She asked if you were gonna look.

It is pretty insensitive to say that it\u2019s \u201cnasty\u201d considering she is carrying your child. You don\u2019t have to look \u201cdown there\u201d when she gives birth if you don\u2019t want to, but just remember that your wife will be going through hell to bring YOUR child into the world.

You\u2019re more of a dumbass.", "YTA - How you feel is valid, but you should work on filtering your thoughts before you open your mouth. The last thing your fianc\u00e9 needed to hear was a judgmental comment about how her body is going to look \"nasty\" bringing forth your child into the world. Labor is painful and ya know deadly enough on its own. Now she's probably concerned about how disgusting she is going to look to you. These types of statements erode the connection and trust in a relationship.", "YTA. Some things you just keep to yourself.

One everyone knows how the giving birth isnt pretty, but she is putting herself through something that's going to take every ounce of her strength to give the both of you something amazing.

Yes he could\u2019ve chosen better words to say he did not want to see the physical birthing process. But y\u2019all need to calm down. He did not say he\u2019s not going to take care of the kid when it gets gross.

Now i can get not wanting to look, I accidently looked at myself and it was a gorry sight lol, its not pretty, but maybe just maybe be a bit more sensitive in how you turn down the up close and personal view (for examble: no baby, I want to be here right next to you. Holding your hand as you do this amazing thing for our family ) you get what I mean right?? Dont be a Dick, she is carrying your child after all.", "YTA. The comment was very insensitive.

Childbirth IS pretty gross, but it'd be like her looking at your penis pulling a face and saying \"it's nasty\" cuz she wasnt in the mood. It's demeaning and hurtful to say that about something to someone who will be physically experiencing the nasty thing (which we can feel the blood and slime and lube and stretching and tearing, we can't escape the feeling of what you might see), to someone who will be going through something that could potentially kill them. \n\nWhat you need to do is apologize, get her her favorite current snack and drink, and tell her \"your question caught me off guard. I want to support you however you need. When we're both in a better spot I'd like to discuss ways I can support you in labor\".

I\u2019m sure that isn\u2019t true, but I could imagine myself being annoyed by someone always talking about how gross stuff is rather than just getting on with it. \n\nAlso I think parents probably become desensitised to that stuff after a while anyway", "Part of what you DO is the things you choose to SAY.
