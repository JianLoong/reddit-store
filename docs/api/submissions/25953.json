You have tried many times to explain the difference between the myriad daily and weekly tasks involved in maintaining a household and the handful of larger and much less frequent tasks involved in maintaining the yard*. He's not getting it - and it's true that some things cannot actually be truly understood until they're experienced (like the exhaustion and stress of having a baby who won't sleep). \n\nThing is, I'll bet you guys have very different ideas of what tasks are required and how frequently. You may believe that vacuuming is a weekly job; he may be totally fine with monthly. You may believe that the kitchen should be cleaned at night before bed; he may be totally fine with having to wash each dish before he uses it and doing a proper clean only when people come over.\n\nSo I'm not sure you're going to achieve what you want, because he will _not_ be doing everything you normally do and he may not even notice the difference. But he will think that he's taken over everything that's required and it wasn't that hard so what were you complaining about. \n\nI think you'll actually create more problems for yourself than fewer. If you haven't tried already, I'd suggest taking a couple of weeks to create a list of everything you do and the frequency you do it. Make sure you get it all. Have him do the same. Then the two of you review the lists and he can say how often he thinks those things should be done. Then discuss and divide by task or by schedule. \n\nNAH yet. I know, your other half seems like he's being the AH, but it's through ignorance and (I suspect) a different take on what's necessary vs over the top. If he will not engage in a focused discussion and will not compromise along with you, then he really will be the AH.\n\nGood luck. \n\n\n\n*I know that large sections or beautifully landscaped grounds or a big veggie garden take a lot of work, but it doesn't sound like that applies here.\n\n* *I know that women can be the messy ones and men the tidy ones.
