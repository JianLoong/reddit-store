You have tried many times to explain the difference between the myriad daily and weekly tasks involved in maintaining a household and the handful of larger and much less frequent tasks involved in maintaining the yard*. He's not getting it - and it's true that some things cannot actually be truly understood until they're experienced (like the exhaustion and stress of having a baby who won't sleep). \n\nThing is, I'll bet you guys have very different ideas of what tasks are required and how frequently. You may believe that vacuuming is a weekly job; he may be totally fine with monthly. You may believe that the kitchen should be cleaned at night before bed; he may be totally fine with having to wash each dish before he uses it and doing a proper clean only when people come over.\n\nSo I'm not sure you're going to achieve what you want, because he will _not_ be doing everything you normally do and he may not even notice the difference. But he will think that he's taken over everything that's required and it wasn't that hard so what were you complaining about. \n\nI think you'll actually create more problems for yourself than fewer. If you haven't tried already, I'd suggest taking a couple of weeks to create a list of everything you do and the frequency you do it. Make sure you get it all. Have him do the same. Then the two of you review the lists and he can say how often he thinks those things should be done. Then discuss and divide by task or by schedule. \n\nNAH yet. I know, your other half seems like he's being the AH, but it's through ignorance and (I suspect) a different take on what's necessary vs over the top.

Like it\u2019s nice if this area is clean and there are flowers  and a side table, but if that\u2019s not the case, they\u2019ll still be content. Still, I like this plan. You\u2019ll have to stick to your guns with it though because the build up of undone stuff is what\u2019s more likely to make an impression than his having to sweep up once.

My hubby's only jobs are yard work and taking out the garbage, I do everything else, BUT he works, I'm a SAHM.\n\nIf he works and you don't, then sure, it's a fair split, but if you both work, then you need to redistribute the household chores. \n\nAre the pets inside or outside pets, and did he agree to have/bring in the pets, if yes then he needs to step up and provide a suitable environment for them.\n\nYou wouldn't be the AH but, it seems like you two need to have an actual conversation because these passive aggressive actions of refusing to do your share to make a point is not healthy for a relationship.", "You should just offer to switch chores.

If your partner starts complaining about the mess - dirty floors, fur everywhere, dishes in the sink whatever - and you clean everyday, then now he knows the house needs to picked up everyday. If he only did laundry once a week but you were supplementing and now you're not, then if he runs out of clean clothes before the week is up he'll realize laundry needs to be done more often.

Baby eats, you wash the floor and maybe even the walls!", "You win by leaving the house once it gets too disgusting and you don\u2019t come back til it\u2019s clean.

This reminds me of a story/joke about the different parts of the body arguing over who should be the boss.\n\nThe brain said that they send all the signals to do everything, so they should be the boss.\n\nThe feet said you can send me all the signals you want, but if I don't actually move, we go nowhere, so I should be the boss.\n\nThe heart said that if it doesn't send blood through the body, none of you are doing anything, so I should be the boss.\n\nThe lungs said if I don't put oxygen in that blood, you're pretty worthless, heart, so I should be the boss.\n\nAnd different parts made their arguments, on and on. The asshole spoke up quietly at one point, and asked, what about me? And all the others laughed at it.\n\nSo the asshole closed up and refused to open. The body got sick, organs were starting to shut down, and the body was dying. They begged and pleaded for it to open back up, but it refused until they all apologized and recognized it as the boss. So they did.\n\nThe moral of the story is that you don't have to be smart, or strong, or quick to be the boss. You just have to be an asshole.\n\nI mention this because they're essentially laughing at the idea that what you do is important or meaningful, so make like an asshole and close up shop.

I have no problem with helping with the yard work, but he implied that I never help. This then led to the discussion about everything I do around the house and he claims that it\u2019s not hard work and asked what exactly it is that I even do\u2026  to which I replied that I will stop doing what I do everyday and you will soon see. I do most things and anything that is delegated to him I usually end up doing anyway. So I have stopped doing anything except what I need like washing my own clothes, washing a dish that I need, not cleaning the floors or tidying any clutter or mess.
