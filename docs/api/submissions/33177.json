{"id": 33177, "submission_id": "18k7sn1", "title": "AITA for letting my daughter wear my other daughter's dress despite her telling me no?", "selftext": "I (36M) am a single father, and though I have a few sons, this story is mainly focused around my two daughters, Yume(13F) and Hana(7F). For a little backround info, Yume's mother and I divorced a while ago, she was around 3 at the time. I have had legal custody over her for as long as we have been split, and though she used to visit her mother over the weekend, she currently has to stay with her over summer because her mother recently moved farther away. Our family isn't considered well off, I make ends meet, though I can't always buy them clothing and such. With that cleared up, I usually pass my older children's clothing down to their siblings once they dont fit any longer, and the older siblings occasionally get hand-me-downs from their cousins. \n\nNow we can get onto the story. The other day, it was brought to my attention that Hana's school pictures were coming up, and I wanted to dress her in something nice. When I went to help her look in her closet, (Yume and Hana both share a room and closet) we both noticed this adorable dress. Hana and I agreed that she would be wearing it, and started brainstorming some ideas on how to do her hair. \n\nI figured that was the end of it, until later that afternoon, Yume came into my room, with Hana behind her, in tears. She asked if I said that Hana could wear her dress, and I asked her what she meant. She argued that the pink dress was hers, and I told her that it was Hana's dress now, because it clearly wouldn't fit her. She began yelling at me, claiming that she should be able to keep it because it was special to her, and went on saying that her mother gave it to her a couple years ago, and that she no longer gave her gifts anymore. I told her that was okay, but it should make her even more happy to see her baby sister in her \"special\" dress. She yelled at me said that she would mess it up, and ran off to her room. \nI sympathize with her, but I hadn't changed my mind on it. \n\nEventually, picture day came, and once Yume left to walk to school, I helped Hana get into the dress. She was truly so happy, and I gladly took her to school and dropped her there. After school, I took her out for mcdonald's, it's her favorite and she gets nervous in front of cameras, so I figured i'd treat her. Unfortunately, Hana got some sauce on Yume's dress, and I knew she wouldn't be too happy about it. \n\nWhen I arrived home, Yume was already there, and once she noticed Hana wearing the stained dress, I could see the anger in her eyes. Instead of blowing up on us, she pushed past us and ran outside. I figured she possibly wanted to go on a walk to calm down, and I let it be.  A few hours went by, however, and she didn't come back, so I knew that I had to go get her. It was a hassle, I had to go drive around town until I found her walking down the roads, and I brought her, obviously not happy with her. She's been grounded, and lately I have been wondering if her anger was justified. Do what you do best reddit, AITA?\n\n\n\nUpdate: Thank you all for your feedback, even if some of it is unreasonably harsh. I have even got a couple of DMs in concern of Yume! Before I clear some things up, I want to tell you all Yume is very loved and cared for. I am currently thinking about what I can do to talk this out with her, and under everyone's advice, I will be ungrounding her. \n\nAnyways, back to my original point. Firstly, a lot of people are claiming Hana to be my favorite, and that I am putting a wedge in their relationship. To that i'm not exactly sure to say other than I love them both equally. Yume is much more mature and independent, so compared to Hana who is much younger, of course I will treat them differently. Another thing I would like to note is that we are immigrants, we are not from America and I am not asking for any type of criticism on my wording or vocabulary.\n\nNext off, a lot of people are confused that I am not well off but can take Hana to mcdonald's, and that is simply unreasonable. I don't only give them hand-me-downs, on holidays and special occasions I buy my children clothing. Fast food is also affordable, we don't eat out every night but it is a common occurrence to stop by a fast food joint because we can't afford a lot of organic groceries, and I have a job and cannot cook for them all the time. I figured it was a nice treat to show that I was proud that she could overcome her fear.\n\nAnd more on the topic of the mcdonald's and the spill, I have realized I should have brought along some sort of apron or got her a less messy meal. I will clarify, however, that before we ate the food, I made it clear to Hana that she couldn't make a mess because the dress was fancy. It was all accidental and the situation played out very unluckily. \n\nAlso, for all of you telling me to get their dress cleaned, I will see what I can do. Yume claims the dress is hand wash only, and i'm not sure about how to do that. If anybody has any advice, let me know.", "created_utc": 1702782579, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18k7sn1/aita_for_letting_my_daughter_wear_my_other/", "score": 247, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just because it doesn't make sense to you, doesn't mean there isn't validity to what she wants. It also is very relevent that this dress was something your ex-wife provided it, that means you had no right to take it for your other daughter. Yume and her mother get to decide what happens with the dress, not you!\n\nWhat's worse is that you are punishing Yume for your messing up. She doesn't deserve to be grounded for leaving the house in anger, you already demonstrated that talking to you about her feeling is completely worthless. Her anger is totally justified; you're supposed to be the adult here and you are failing at it, big time.", "Let's see, we've got \"giving away one child's belongings to another child without permission\", \"telling one child they have no choice in something that they should have a choice in\", and \"punishing a child for being reasonably upset in a situation you created\".

YTA", "YTA\n\nSorry but your daughter said no, gave you a very valid reason as to why this dress is so important to her and why she didn\u2019t want anyone else to have it and you waited for her to leave before you went behind her back to take something so important and ruin it for her \n\nI never understand why some adults are so quick to dismiss children\u2019s feelings, like they don\u2019t matter or they should just get over it\n\nThat may be one of the last things she ever gets from her mum and you took it and destroyed it and when she reacted to your horrible behaviour you punished her!\n\nI know single parenting is hard but my goodness man do better!", "Yta and a massive one\n\nIt was a special dress with memorys and she told you what would happen. Not so surprising that she would be right \n\nI dont understand why you took Hana still in the dress to a place like mcdonalds, specially a 7 y old\n\n  \nThe only one who should be grounded is you for that horrible parenting", "\\*looking askance at the \"I have a few sons\" line... strangely worded... moving on\\*\n\nYTA\n\nA the ol' telling-someone-they-should-feel-happy-when-they-are-mad-or-sad strategy.  I think that has a 0% of working.\n\nYour description of the events does not do you much credit.  It makes you sound either clueless, playing favorites, or having very little empathy (or all 3).   It always to make me bristle when adults dismiss children's sense of ownership, as if its not ok to feel ownership of something.  It is the strangest thing and adults, especially parents, seem to somehow forget this.   Don't get me wrong, sharing is great, a virtue and all that.  But only when someone is truly feels ownership can they actually share.  Nor is \"sharing something\" a universal something that must ALWAYS happen, ALWAYS.   Plus When Dad just comes in and tyrannically takes stuff from one kid and gives it to another, its not sharing and doesn't teach anyone to share.   It just teaches that whining and manipulation wins\n\nThis was Yume's dress, and it was a special one that her mom gave her.    Or it was special to her because she liked the color.  Or it was special to her because of 18 other reasons\n\nA kid doesn't have a lot of control in their universe.  They  might have their own room, some toys, and their clothes.  In your case, where 2 kids are sharing a room, their personal stuff means that much more.   And when parents just roughshod over this sense of ownership out of some misaligned sense of ... duty to sharing,  it just strikes me as being mean.\n\nPlus I would add that somewhere in Yume's mind  she knew that her sister would get it dirty.  And guess what.\n\nThe upshot is you stole something of Yume's and gave it to your youngest daughter.  And you punished her for it.   Her anger was justified.   You did not handle this situation well at all.   A bunch   of different ways you could have handled it. A lot of those ways would have even ended up with Yume lending Hana the dress.\n\nI also ask you  - I don't want to say that all kids are Kaisar Soze,  but Do you think Hana came to you first for a reason?", "YTA Yume is *clearly* struggling with her mom not being around. She didn't even make it difficult to figure out. It's pretty easy to explain to the youngest what a sentimental item is and why she couldn't wear it.", "YTA\n\nYou completely ignored your older daughter's feelings and played the AH role. You also caused her to feel differently about her younger sister in a negative way. \n\nYou could've bought your younger daughter an inexpensive dress to call her own for the school photos or something. Or at least a new pretty top to go with her favorite jeans if the photos weren't full body ones. \n\nGet that sauce stain out then apologize to Yume. \n\nYou were wrong.", "YTA - you prioritized your younger daughter at the expense of her sister. Now something precious to Yume has been ruined and it\u2019s your fault. You also said you can\u2019t afford to buy clothing so she knows she\u2019s not getting a replacement for that special dress.\n\nAnd to add insult to injury you punished her for a perfectly normal response to your lack of consideration. Such an AH.", "All I had to do was read the title to know YTA. Then I read the post and I doubled down, YTA squared. Obviously your daughter as an attachment to the dress. You just bulldozed and ignored your daughter's feelings.", "YTA full stop", "YTA\n\nChrist you treat Yume like shit. \n\n> I'm not exactly sure what upset her so much, but I feel like I should probably try and find out because she had a huge reaction to it, and I want to make sure my daughters are happy.\n\nNo, you were only concerned with making Hana happy. Making Yume happy was never a consideration for you. \n\nWhat you did *for Hana:*\n\n* Stole Yume\u2019s dress that had sentimental value and gave it to Hana. Did not correct it when Yume told you why that dress was special to her. \n\n* Helped Hana into the dress after you knew Yume would not be able to interfere. \n\n* Take Hana to McD\u2019s as a treat. It sounds like you don\u2019t have much money so treating a kid to fast food is a pretty big deal. \n\nWhat you did *to Yume:*\n\n* Unilaterally gave her dress to Hana. \n\n* Dismiss Yumi\u2019s feelings about the sentimental value of the dress. \n\n* Helped Hana steal the dress against Yume\u2019s wishes \n\n* Did not bring back a meal to Yume after taking her sister to McD\u2019s. \n\n* Grounded her for how she expressed her feelings. \n\nLet\u2019s be real here. If Yumi blew up at you like you expected when you arrived home, you would have grounded Yume anyways for being upset about the dress and yelling at you. Instead she went out and you see her more as a hassle, probably because she sees your flaws as a person who isn\u2019t always right. You still love Hana for now because she still sees you as her daddy who makes everything better. \n\nThe favoritism is quite obvious. You don\u2019t like your daughter Yume.  You never apologized for disregarding her feelings, nor for helping Hana stealing the dress and getting it stained. Nothing you did was for Yume\u2019s benefit or happiness. \n\nYume is being failed by both her parents. Poor child.", "YTA. What the heck is wrong with you? This is fake right? So her mom is basically out of her life and she probably only has this pink dress to hang on as a symbol of her mom\u2019s love. You decided without talking to your daughter who owns the dress to just give it away to your younger daughter. And when she told you how special it was to her you didn\u2019t care and let your youngest ruin it. Your daughter was so upset with you that she ran away and you think it\u2019s a good idea to ground her. You do know she\u2019s going to cut contact with you as soon as she\u2019s 18 right?", "YTA. She told you her feelings regarding the dress. You disregarded your daughter for the other one. Behold, the dress is now stained.", "Your daughter set a reasonable boundary and you trampled all over it while giving zero fucks. I feel bad for her due to having two parents that are let downs.\n\nYTA", "Yta, you didn't even bought the dress, it was a gift from yume's mother, it was precious to her, you had no say in it \n\nAnd you grounded her for being rightfully mad at you", "Come on man, you know YTA here. You should have bought your younger kid a new dress when you saw your daughter was visibly upset and specifically explained her reasoning to you. It's even worse that you let it get stained. Just bad decisions all around and you owe her an apology.", "YTA. Even if there's a pass on not letting your child have one thing that is actually hers, why on EARTH wouldnt you bring a change of clothes before taking the younger one out to eat?", "YTA It was Yume's dress.  Her mother gave it to her.  You suck as a father.  Sharing is bs.  Why do people teach kids that.  As an adult are you going to share your car or your house with your brother just because he wants it? No.", "Wow. You're the asshole of the month. YTA in a huge way. Your daughter literally said that the dress was special so you ignored her like she didn't matter, you waited for her to go away and went ahead and gave away her dress. Then when the dress is stained and she's feeling that not only is the special dress/memory ruined, you pretty much act like you don't care and get angry at her for being upset. Frankly I find your behavior disgusting, especially since you took the daughter to McDonald's who supposedly was nervous around cameras and the one you stole from, ignored, and treated like used tissue, you just ignored. Somehow I get the feeling you've got a golden child and it sure as hell isn't Yume.", "YTA.  The dress was given to Yume by her mother, who is NOT Hana's mother.  It was extremely wrong for you to give it to Hana against Yume's wishes.  You should apologize to her, not ground her!", "YTA and a theif. That dress was not yours. It wasn\u2019t passed to your daughter through her cousin, you did not buy it for her. It was a gift from her mother and you took it and gave it to someone else against her specific wishes. Not only did you let your younger daughter wear it but knowing that she would probably ruin it you took her out to eat in it. Also McDonald\u2019s for one and not for all is an AH move. She sat for a picture, that doesn\u2019t deserve a special treat. \nIn conclusion you are an AH, a thief, a shitty father for playing favorites and a jerk for punishing Yume when she got upset at you for being your crappy self. Lift her punishment and do better.", "So is the real story that you hate Yume's mother and so therefore you punish Yume for being her mother's daughter?\n\nShe set a boundary for HER possession, she told you her reason why.. and yet you took out your kid for food to mess up the dress.\n\nYou're a bad father to Yume. You also let a 13 yo wander outside for hours without a clue where she was... it's almost like you wish this child would vanish so your life could be better.\n\nYou're an adult. You're a parent. do better. DO VASTLY BETTER. You're failing as a parent here. But I wonder if all the YTAs here make a difference to you. \n\nDo YOU care about Yume? Her anger was justified. You hurt her, and you failed her. What do you plan to do to fix this?", "YTA. You're so nasty and selfish. Your daughter did exactly what your older daughter feared she would. That dress was a gift, and it had sentimental meaning for her. But you made it clear that you don't give a crap about her feelings and you even grounded her for getting upset about it.

It\u2019s so difficult for girls to develop a healthy self esteem when none of their boundaries are respected.", "Leave aside that it\u2019s clothing, OP. Yume had a special item that her mother gave her, and you passed it on to Hana and then took Hana to a place where it was pretty likely that something might happen to the dress.

And YTA especially for the \u201cwell it should make you even happier that your sister now has your special possession\u201d BS. Yume is hurt about her waning connection with her mother, and you treated what she had left as just something else to be passed along to your younger child. Yume needs to be able to have important things that are hers and stay hers, and you don\u2019t get to tell her what she\u2019s supposed to feel is important. And now you\u2019re punishing her even more.", "YTA.\n\nThat wasn't your dress to give. It was hers and that should have been enough. It doesn't matter if it held significance or not. It was hers. But the fact that it was from her estranged mother makes you an even bigger AH.\n\nWhat you don't realize is that especially in a family where hand me downs are common, having something that is exclusively YOURS matters so much. And you trampled all over that in your eagerness to please your younger daughter. \n\nYou need to apologize, get that dress dry cleaned for her, and hope that at some point she will come to trust you again.", "YTA. Sigh. I know too well what it feels like to have a parent dismiss my feelings in favor of a sibling. It is so frustrating and has created resentment way into adulthood for me. Being listened to and understood, and having your feelings validated is so important as a teenager. It doesn\u2019t matter if you thought the topic was silly, the way you responded will have a lasting impact if you keep it up.", "YTA - not everything your children own must be shared with siblings especially not anything given to them by their other parent.  I get you're making an effort for your kids but they also need their other parent and may form attachments to things which represent that parent.  Also, don't be silly - which kid with an attachment to something they consider special from a parent would be happy to share it with their sibling who is not the child of that parent?   Your kids have different realities (different moms and parenting situations) and you can't force sameness and 100% sharing.  To do so would be to ignore each child's unique psychological needs and create ill will in your home.  Yume's need for connection with her mom trumps Hana's desire to wear a pretty dress.  Plus you're showing a lot of favoritism - ignore Yume's very valid point re her dress and then taking Hana out in dress to treat her because she gets nervous.  You think nerves over a class photo trump the way Yume is feeling re her absent mother and non-caring father?  And what did you do?  It was a hassle to get your angry (actually, hurt) daughter and you grounded her.  Massive A.", "YTA. A HUGE AH. She took the time to explain to you why the dress was special to her.

I want to give you my perspective as someone who has been in Yume\u2019s position.\n\nI have a sister a year and a half younger than me who is the baby of the family and my mother never respected my possessions when it came to her. My younger sister also never had to follow the same rules I had, even though I was a freaking poster child and my sister was a heathen. The dress is clearly special to Yume. You might have listened to what she said, but you aren\u2019t HEARING her. The fact that your younger daughter then stained the dress (which I\u2019m sure was a genuine accident) that was special to Yume AND got a \u201cspecial treat\u201d of McDonald\u2019s was just salt in the wound when it comes to disrespecting Yume\u2019s boundaries. She is a teenager and she should start having some boundaries as she begins the transition towards adulthood. If the dress was from Yume\u2019s mom (not Hana\u2019s) that makes this entire scenario even more unacceptable.\n\nTo be frank, you\u2019re setting a horrible example for the kind of behavior your daughters should tolerate when it comes to men and other people in general. You\u2019re inadvertently teaching them that it\u2019s okay if the people in their lives don\u2019t respect their belongings and boundaries. And you\u2019re teaching your younger daughter that she doesn\u2019t have to respect other people\u2019s possessions and boundaries. Again, speaking from personal experience with my own little sister, your younger daughter is going to end up being an entitled brat her entire life if you continue doing things like this.\n\nSpeaking from personal experience, YOU ARE putting a wedge in their relationship. Whether or not you fully understand that is a bit moot when you have daughters who can\u2019t stand each other, and you are going to create real long-lasting resentment between them. My sister and I have a horrible relationship to this day and I largely blame my parents (mostly my mother) for it. I always had to share, but my sister never did. When my sister ruined my stuff, even on purpose, no punishment. If I ruined her things, always on accident, I was punished mercilessly. To this day, my sister feels entitled to everything I have, and is hateful towards me when I refuse to give things to her. \n\nI understand that this isn\u2019t your intention, but every action has consequences- even unintended ones. I am just trying to give you some perspective from someone who was in Yume\u2019s shoes at one point.\n\nI would suggest that you apologize to Yume (and frankly Hana also needs to apologize to Yume for staining her dress, even if it was an accident). YOU chose to ignore Yume\u2019s wishes. YOU made the choice that led to her sister ruining the dress. YOU then allowed Yume to wander for hours as a MINOR and then punished her for it. I could go on an entire rant about how you probably deserve to be reported to CPS for reckless endangerment of a minor. *You are a lucky AH for the fact that nothing horrific happened to Yume.*\n\nApologizing to your children for your mistakes will teach them to be accountable for their own mistakes in the future. I have a great Dad, and he often stood up for me against my mom and younger sister. His respect for me, my boundaries, my goals, my possessions, etc has led to us having a great relationship as adults. I can\u2019t say the same for my mother or sister. \n\nPlease don\u2019t hurt or ruin your relationship with Yume or the relationship between Yume and her sister because you can\u2019t accept that you, the adult, are at fault for this sequence of events.", "YTA.

You didn't want the older child or got stuck with her, but you wanted your younger one? Is that why they're treated so differently?\nYou can argue it's just stuff, but some things have sentimental value to others.\n It's not just girls either. My husband and his sister were raised by their paternal grandparents. While visiting his Dad his step brother stole his necklace off the patio table. It was on the table because he didn't want to get it wet while swimming in the pool. His mother gave him that necklace.

For a little backround info, Yume's mother and I divorced a while ago, she was around 3 at the time. I have had legal custody over her for as long as we have been split, and though she used to visit her mother over the weekend, she currently has to stay with her over summer because her mother recently moved farther away. Our family isn't considered well off, I make ends meet, though I can't always buy them clothing and such. With that cleared up, I usually pass my older children's clothing down to their siblings once they dont fit any longer, and the older siblings occasionally get hand-me-downs from their cousins. \n\nNow we can get onto the story. The other day, it was brought to my attention that Hana's school pictures were coming up, and I wanted to dress her in something nice. When I went to help her look in her closet, (Yume and Hana both share a room and closet) we both noticed this adorable dress. Hana and I agreed that she would be wearing it, and started brainstorming some ideas on how to do her hair. \n\nI figured that was the end of it, until later that afternoon, Yume came into my room, with Hana behind her, in tears. She asked if I said that Hana could wear her dress, and I asked her what she meant. She argued that the pink dress was hers, and I told her that it was Hana's dress now, because it clearly wouldn't fit her. She began yelling at me, claiming that she should be able to keep it because it was special to her, and went on saying that her mother gave it to her a couple years ago, and that she no longer gave her gifts anymore. I told her that was okay, but it should make her even more happy to see her baby sister in her \"special\" dress. She yelled at me said that she would mess it up, and ran off to her room. \nI sympathize with her, but I hadn't changed my mind on it. \n\nEventually, picture day came, and once Yume left to walk to school, I helped Hana get into the dress. She was truly so happy, and I gladly took her to school and dropped her there. After school, I took her out for mcdonald's, it's her favorite and she gets nervous in front of cameras, so I figured i'd treat her. Unfortunately, Hana got some sauce on Yume's dress, and I knew she wouldn't be too happy about it. \n\nWhen I arrived home, Yume was already there, and once she noticed Hana wearing the stained dress, I could see the anger in her eyes. Instead of blowing up on us, she pushed past us and ran outside. I figured she possibly wanted to go on a walk to calm down, and I let it be.  A few hours went by, however, and she didn't come back, so I knew that I had to go get her. It was a hassle, I had to go drive around town until I found her walking down the roads, and I brought her, obviously not happy with her. She's been grounded, and lately I have been wondering if her anger was justified. Do what you do best reddit, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Ask them to be extra careful with the dress and that it is important to get the stain out.\n\nIf it can be hand washed: The best is to get a liquid detergent that is made for delicates. \n\nBegin with stain removal. My mother taught me, greasy stains like food stains are best treated with the cleaning product you use for hand washing dishes in the sink (NOTE: not the one made for the dishwasher). Pour some of that directly on the stain. Rub it gently with your finger. Sort of between a caress and a massage. Be gentle with the fabric. Then leave for a few minutes, but not for too long bc that might affect the color of the fabric.    \n\nPour a basin of water, no warmer than your hands. Add a little detergent, use your hands to make it dissolve in the water. The bottle will tell you how much to use. Soak the entire dress. With your hands in the water, squeeze the water from the fabric and sort of move it around in the water. Be gentle with the fabric. Be extra careful with the stain, make sure the dish washing product that you put on the stain gets completely washed away. Empty the basin. DON'T WRING THE DRESS. Just squeeze it with your hands.

It HAS affected my relationship with my parents as an adult.\n\nIf you would like a relationship with Yume as an adult/once independent from you, I really suggest you reconsider your actions. And start with a sincere apology, including the words \"I was wrong\" and why.", "It also sounds from the story like it\u2019s common for her to give clothing to her sister. Handing down her clothes isn\u2019t uncommon and I have to imagine that it\u2019s generally a non-issue. She wanted to be able to hold on to this *one* piece because it was important to her. Not only did OP decide her feelings weren\u2019t worth concerning himself with, he practically made sure it would get stained on purpose. OP you need to pay to have the dress dry cleaned and/or repaired and offer an apology. \n\nOn a personal note, growing up in a big family where nothing is ever yours is hard. Having experienced this myself, I would argue it\u2019s detrimental to relationships between parents and children, and between siblings. I am not close with one of my sisters. One of the reasons is that as children we weren\u2019t permitted to have our own distinct identities. We constantly pushed against the efforts of family to treat us like all of our friends, hobbies, and stuff were interchangeable and irrelevant because we were close in age. \u201cIf your sister wants your sweater, who cares, if your sister wants to do tap dance, you can too, I\u2019m not going to separate activities.\u201d You\u2019re hurting the relationship between your daughters, likely permanently. As they get older, they need - not want - time and things that they can call their own and do not have to share. In conclusion, YTA massively. You need to entirely change a lot of things about how you\u2019re parenting your daughters.", "> Sorry but your daughter said no, ~~gave you a very valid reason as to why this dress is so important to her and why she didn\u2019t want anyone else to have it~~ and you waited for her to leave before you went behind her back to take something so important and ruin it for her\n\nYou can get rid of the part about the reason. It doesn\u2019t matter. She said no, there doesn\u2019t need to be a reason. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s to give, they aren\u2019t even the one who bought the dress. \n\nAnd it should have never gotten here to begin with. OP knew he didn\u2019t buy the dress and that it wasn\u2019t Hana\u2019s. The conversation should\u2019ve stopped there until they asked Yume, OP was wrong as soon as they decided that they could randomly reassign clothes.", ">I never understand why some adults are so quick to dismiss children\u2019s feelings, like they don\u2019t matter or they should just get over it\n\nBecause, as is the case with our AH OP here, the parents are as narcissistic as shiiiiiiiiiittttttt!!!\n\nThe kids in this tale of woeful parenting could probably learn a lot from r/raisedbynarcissists sadly \u2639\ufe0f", "Op didn't even buy the damn dress.\n\nJust another poor girl this sperm dona got preggy", ">and she told you what would happen\n\nYup...

Well said! \n\nIt\u2019s amazing how often parents trivialize their children\u2019s legitimate emotions and then get angry when their kid doesn\u2019t blindly obey their unreasonable demands.\n\nDefinitely YTA on this one OP.

Yume\u2019s mom sounds like a flake and that sucks, because she is old enough to decide what parent to live with and if I were in her shoes I would be out of this mess.", "Additional important note- the mom was diagnosed with a terminal illness and I believe she said she only has a year or so left", "Agree to disagree. These are children. This isn\u2019t a wedding dress. Mom isn\u2019t dead. It\u2019s for picture day. It\u2019s a little stain. I don\u2019t think we are into bad dad territory.", "\u201cSteal it\u201d? Come on dude. Let\u2019s really consider the stakes here.", "Well a few points are that truthfully he doesn\u2019t need to paint the full picture of how he loves his older daughter he didn\u2019t exactly paint that picture about his younger one either. This is just one situation that is sort of explained in a post on the internet. \n\nHe may not know how to talk about feelings but he is big enough to admit that he tried talking to her about it while being considerate but without giving her her way just because she had a big feeling. That\u2019s not dismissing of her feelings as much as it\u2019s probably poor emotional intelligence and lacking communication skills. Which is why I agree that him and Yume both could stand to benefit from therapy. \n\nTruthfully he told Yume that her sister would be wearing the dress at the end of the discussion they had and made no promises otherwise. Having that awareness it wasn\u2019t behind her back as you say but I can understand your pov on the situation. \n\nKids are not always going to be treated the exact same all of the time and I\u2019m sorry but not bringing back McDonald\u2019s for the older girl is truly outside of the point in this. And he did not ground her for expressing her feelings, in a moment of panic and stress and frustration he grounded her for doing something unsafe. He is going to unground her and have a deeper conversation with her about those actions and why they aren\u2019t okay which, while he should have done it initially not everybody has the emotional control to do. \n\nJust because the dress was bought for her doesn\u2019t mean it should be hers forever and nobody else\u2019s, what if he cleaned out the closet of stuff she no longer fit and donated it? Would everybody be upset in the same way? I highly doubt so because it wouldn\u2019t be sibling against sibling. If it was a more personal item like jewelry or a music box/knickknack or something I could truly understand but she can\u2019t keep this dress forever, she does need to learn to let go of it, and he didnt even argue that the dress would be Hana\u2018s just that it was the best thing for her to wear and that she could borrow it for a day and if she got it messy he would get it cleaned. \n\nAs someone who grew up with a sibling that was 100% prioritized as the favorite and the treatment wasn\u2019t \u201eoh I didn\u2019t get McDonald\u2019s\u201c unbalanced but \u201emy sister got $400 worth of stuff at the store and I was allowed to get something for less than $10 out of pity because they brought me along\u201c and then we got into a disagreement and what I got was then given to her like she was innocent in the argument, and I had to beg my parents for months to take me to the doctor and they let my bronchitis turn into pneumonia that was very severe because they refused to acknowledge that it wasn\u2019t \u201ejust a cough\u201c but the second their star child got a hint of a cough right to the doctor.. constantly being compared to and put down in comparison of said sibling\u2026 this just isn\u2019t it. Plus how hard the dad is working to try and make space for his daughter and her feelings and acknowledge them and listen to her.. he\u2019s not perfect but he\u2019s doing amazing and he most definitely isn\u2019t an asshole. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t owe anyone proof of loving his daughter, and letting her younger sister wear a dress isn\u2019t proof to any claim of him not loving her that\u2019s insanity. You can\u2019t possibly know what he would have done or how he would have handled a situation that never existed either.. to be honest you\u2019re injecting too much into the story and basing your judgement mostly on hypotheticals", "But it's more than 2 kids. It's 4+. Having that many plus being in financial hardship would make me think that less care is being taken with each kid as an individual. That OP didn't recognize a dress that Yume has had for a couple of years and is special to her, also gives the impression that he's stretched thin with too many kids. If he was being that thoughtless with just 2, then he would be an even bigger AH than he already is here.", "tale as old as time", "Oh but 13-year-old Yume is \u201cmuch more mature and independent\u201d than a 7-year-old. \nDad sounds like one of these dads that parentifies his eldest daughter rather than work to make sure she still gets to have a proper supportive childhood. \nInstead of learning how and supporting this little girl he\u2019s shoving her into the \u201cmom\u201d role while letting his youngest remain a kid because the younger kid \u201cis just easier\u201d\n\nLet me predict OP s future. Yume is going to absolutely run from him in about 5 years, right as Hana hits 13 and becomes (as all 13-year-olds do) more challenging. He\u2019s going to get frustrated and likely blame Yuma for \u201cabandoning\u201d them and causing this radical change in Hana. That will push Yuma away even harder and since he\u2019s previously abdicated the role of actual father once the girl hits 13\u2013 he will have no clue what to do with Hana. \n\nOp. You are the parent. You need to listen to both kids. You need to honor their individuality and respect their autonomy but you also absolutely need to go after them when they push away and storm out. You need to assure them that you love them and their big emotions don\u2019t scare you away. You need to give them space to have them and support them working through them. \n\nRight now by letting her run away after exploding with hurt and frustration you are sending the message that you are also afraid of Yuma\u2019s feelings. By leaving a 13-year-old CHILD who is hurting alone for hours and then PUNISHING her when she came back you\u2019ve said \u201cYour feelings are bad. When you have big feelings and big reactions I will abandon you because you\u2019re unworthy of my time and care. You and your need for basic human respect is too frustrating to me\u201d\n\nOP, get everyone into a few sessions of family therapy. Figure out how to raise your girls to be strong, confident, and with the knowledge they are deserving of love and kindness. You\u2019re doing the opposite now. \n\nFfs- let both your girls be kids.", "That\u2019s truly horrible. I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you.", "I\u2019m so sorry\u2026", "Sorry to laugh... But that's so stupid.\n\nYour parents seem bit dim", "I 100% bet if Yume told OP she was nervous about something upcoming he\u2019d tell her to deal with it rather than help her relax or cool down.", "Mom doesn\u2019t need to be dead for a gift to hold an important memory. \n\nIt was not okay if him to steal it from her. Stealing from your children is very far into bad dad territory. This will be a big deal for her in her life. Her dad stole something that was important to her, allowed her younger sibling to destroy it, then punished her for getting angry about it. That\u2019s not something she\u2019s going to forget. \n\nHe\u2019s not just a bad dad, he is an absolutely horrible one.", "I didn't realize the person who gave you something had to be dead in order for you to keep your things, I'll add that to the rolodex of bullshit rules.\n\nNone of that excuses Dad the thief stealing and ruining Yume's things.\n\nAnd yes, Dad clearly stole the dress and then let his favorite eat messy ass food in it.", "The stakes are that the younger sister will have to wear something else. That\u2019s not an excuse to steal something that\u2019s important to your child. \n\nIt belonged to her, she said no. He was absolutely in the wrong for taking it.", "\"Steal\" is accurate.  It was hers.  Given to her by her mom.  It wasn't his, it wasn't her sisters.  He took it without permission and gave it away.  Stealing,  theft, etc .   pretty textbook", "Man. I feel sorry for you if the parents you had makes you think OP is doing amazing as a parent. \n\nSmh. So many people should really think about what kind of parents they will be before procreating. \n\nBless your heart for sharing your perspective.", "I feel like you have personal experience in this as well because I wouldn\u2019t take that bet, I think you\u2019re spot on. Yume would be told she needs to \u201cact her age\u201d despite them both being children.", "Don\u2019t \u201ebless your heart\u201c me. As someone with a professional understanding of psychology, with experience with kids and adults you truly do not know what you\u2019re talking about. Kids should not be hearing the narrative that their feelings automatically make them right in every situation. He held space for her emotions but held firm in his decision. He is doing the best he can and is taking advice to learn how to do better and that is what is amazing. Kids are not owed feeling like their feelings make them the most important person, that\u2019s a toxic and dangerous slope. At the end of the day it is just a dress and when both girls have outgrown it then it was probably going to be donated or handed down anyways. Having unhealthy attachments to items that no longer serve you is something that needs to be addressed. He\u2019s validating her emotions but he\u2019s not letting her emotions become the most important thing. The shadow work needs to be done for people who truly think that the kid needs to be centered in this situation. Sounds more like a lot of unhealed inner children in this comment section.", "No personal experience but I\u2019ve read too many golden child and black sheep/glass child posts on here where that double standard applies. Yume is entirely on the backfoot here, no emotional support at an age where she\u2019s entering the most emotionally turbulent period of her life and no personal space of her own since she has to share a room with Hana, who is clearly OP\u2019s favourite. This won\u2019t be the last clash between them and OP needs to handle it better than he\u2019s handled this.", "I dunno what your professional background is, but wow I just learned a lot reading your posts. Have to try implementing some verbiage similar to that with my son. See if it helps soothe and redirect. Definitely a great take that I\u2019ve never known how to actually express but completely agree.", "100%. I really hope Yume\u2019s mom just changes tbh, OP has a favorite and he can maybe hide it but I doubt it will truly change. It would be better if she could be somewhere where she didn\u2019t have to deal with it and ruin her future relationship with Hana honestly.", "OP needs to be ready to help Yume when Aunt Flo comes since there\u2019s no indicated maternal figures in her life she can rely on."]}
