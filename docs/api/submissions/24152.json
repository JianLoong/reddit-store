Maybe he fucked off and went fishing, golfing, w/e he's into. Feels guilty about bailing on camping and said he slept. Maybe he just stayed home and was a degenerate playing video games all day away from MIL and doesn't want to admit it. Maybe he is hooking up with MIL on the side and it's all an elaborate hoax. Who knows.", "Not ruling this out but this is an insanely dangerous assumption to make.", "I never understood this. How are you so confident about what\u2019s going on in someone else\u2019s life? Even with what op shared there is no way you could know without a doubt that he\u2019s cheating.", "Yes, THANK YOU I just can\u2019t get past the wood stick on the pillow", "Most people do get annoyed at being caught in lies.", "Especially since if he went out for a legitimate reason (buying some medicine, grabbing stomach friendly food, whatever) he could easily just say that's why he wasn't at home. His defensiveness makes it seem like a straight up lie.", "What the fuck are you talking about? Defensiveness when accused is natural.", "Ehhh,  depends. Sometimes the person is just tired of being accused of bullshit all the time", "I never said that it didn\u2019t matter if it was golf or cheating, I said there was no way of knowing.", "Only Murders in the Building is back!", "That's what the Gilgo Beach guy was doing! Killing people whenever his wife went out of town.\n\nBut seriously, I think he just faked sick to get out of it and was doing something mundane. Or was in the *bathroom* of the spare bedroom so as not to stink up the rest of the house, but didn't want to give her all the shitty details.", "Near spat out my cup of tea. \nNicolas Cage to play the serial killer with explosive Diarrhoea trying to clean up the crime scene of his f\u00e9cal evidence. \nJudi Dench to play the crafty mother in law who knows somethings not quite right.", "Why wouldn\u2019t she call or text? Why go straight to searching the house and then telling on him, which is what caused all of this. For someone who\u2019s not nosy, that was some spectacularly nosy behavior. \n\nIf he felt better and went and did something else he enjoyed instead of camping with a toddler (which sounds like my personal version of hell, tbh), how would that have been received by you and your mom? I wonder if her living with you guys has maybe changed the dynamic for him more than he expected or wants to let on.\n\nYou have every right to ask. He has every right to be annoyed at being asked if that\u2019s not the norm. \n\nNAH, but I\u2019d strongly consider having a conversation with all of you about boundaries. Healthy relationships can be damaged by proximity burn. Having a parent move into your house, who will then transition to your backyard, is A LOT of togetherness.", "It\u2019s hilarious, you check some of the comment histories of these accounts, and you\u2019ll realize just how nuts these people are. I can\u2019t believe people are asking for advice here. They must be just as crazy.", "They are the textbook poster who desperately needs reality to confirm their own fantasy.\n\nLike it's absolutely sickening.\n\nAs you stated hundreds of Reasons the husband lied.\n\nFor all OP knows husband could have been looking for a gift in secret for OP.", "Also easier than \"I went to the bar for the first time in 8 years\" or \"I had lunch with a female friend (platonically)\" or \"I spent the day compulsively masturbating\" or 100 other potentially embarrassing activities. There's something being hidden here, but not necessarily cheating.", "As someone else said earlier, just level with him and tell him you don\u2019t care if he was out with a bud cause he felt better after shitting his brains out. Give him a place where he can tell you the truth without immediately getting negative criticism for being honest.\n\nYour relationship sounds a bit like mine. It sounds like you hard start conversations when you\u2019re stressed. It works with people you seldomly interact with, but when you live with someone it can get pretty tiring to live under accusation instead of sought to be understood. They\u2019re two different things with the same outcome.\n\nYou sound like the kind of woman who\u2019s going to get her answers on this one way or another. I\u2019d suggest considering the damage you do in uncovering that info.\n\nEveryone has a right to privacy. I don\u2019t care what anyone else says here - nobody likes they\u2019re own phone skeezed through. Please treat your partner how you\u2019d like to be treated.", "Or, just playing devil\u2019s advocate here, he had some big blowup with his in-house mother in law, and needs a little space from them right now.", "Not sure you can generalize a reaction based on your concepts of how innocent people should behave. You don't know the person, or the circumstances they've grown up in: maybe his parents never believed him when he was sick, maybe he feels hurt that she would think that he would fake suck a thing to get out of spending time with family. I am not saying he is innocent, but I am saying that this train of \"reaction psychologists\" is pretty unfounded. Talk to him in a calm way without him feeling like he is in an interrogation room. Communication always flows better in a safe environment.", "Yeah, unless you have already provided the very simple truth and it\u2019s not being accepted for some reason. That\u2019s frustrating as hell. I\u2019ve already told you the truth, I have no further details, how am I supposed to be *more* truthful? Particularly if the issue is being sparked by someone who is kind of a dummy or a busybody (no evidence that mom *is* in this case, but it could be) and if the person making the accusations is prone to paranoia or something. \n\nShit like this has happened to me professionally. Someone who didn\u2019t know what they were talking about started asking some questions about something they didn\u2019t understand, to a supervisor who was *always* looking to find something wrong. Turns out the issue in question wasn\u2019t even being asked about the correct state (different licensing and regulations) and a different date. It took a very frustrating week to straighten out, because there was literally no issue and it was hard to figure out what the accusation even was. \n\nI\u2019m just saying, I understand being very defensive when you know you\u2019ve done nothing wrong. Is it productive? No. But it\u2019s understandable and relatable.", "He could have been doing something else stupid and doesn't want to say anything. \n\nAlso I could think of a bunch of different excuses. He could have gone to the store.  I don't know why he'd hide that, but maybe he's just dumb", "He should be able too yes, but maybe he is scared to admit it. Maybe he didn't wanna have a fight (ironically it probably caused a bigger fight if that is the reason he was out)\n\nBut again who knows until he either admits to something or OP find evidence another way", "Honestly it's maddening, being dishonest doesn't mean cheating.\nMaybe he got better and went for a coffee, maybe he felt guilty about missing the event and didn't want to tell her about feeling better.\n\nIt seems to be often inexperienced and unknowledgable people who comment first and \nloudest.", "*Desecrating the porcelain god*?", "God I hope it\u2019s something as mundane as this", "Maybe he hates camping.", "My money\u2019s on the latter.", "This was a good response and the \"balls deep\" thing is a humorous possibility but not for OP.", "Asking a question is not getting grilled. This is often part of the problem. People go on the defensive so quickly. It\u2019s often a pattern with the same person", "You need a therapist", "Yeah, I do have a limit where being asked a series questions starts to feel like an interrogation. At that point, I will get a little defensive and pissed off.", "100%!! Was starting to think I was the crazy one.\n\nI told you I was sleeping, then you're asking me follow up questions that implies I may have have been doing something. I'd completely ignore her too.\n\nIf you don't trust me, we have bigger issues", "If the genders were reversed you know they would be singing a different tune.\n\nI can already see it. He's being controlling!!! Abuse!!!!\n\nLike holy shit this sub has serious problems with letting their own gender being the only thing that matters.", "You really want the husband to be a POS here why is that?", "I'm not denying the lie being sus... I'm hoping it's a simple \"Tried being tricky\" for a good outcome.", "Enough people have pointed out that they don't, but here's another perspective. I take my phone to the bathroom if I remember, but I very often forget. I'm a forgetful person, so it happens a lot. On top of just regular forgetfulness, there's also the fact that the urgent need to shit when you gave diarrhea can override regular thinking entirely. Sometimes I'm not worried about my phone, I'm worried about getting to the toilet without shitting myself lol", "Is it possible that he didn't feel like visiting with his MIL, hid from her or something, and told the white lie that he was asleep to avoid hurting y'alls feelings by saying that he didn't want to see her? People telling white lies might still turn defensive when pressed because the more someone doubles down, the harder it becomes to tell the truth--even when the explanation is innocent. How is their relationship?\n\nINFO:  Your mom 'has a room' at your house, but does she *live* there full time? If not, that might change the whole perspective on this. \n\nBecause if someone asked to come over while I was home\\*, didn't receive an answer, had no reason to suspect my health or safety was in jeopardy, and ***still*** let themselves in to \"check on me\"? I'd be feeling pretty put-out. If this is the case, there's a fine line between concern and overstepping and your husband might feel like his MIL has crossed it. Is this something he feels like he can talk to you about or might this explain some of his behavior? You know him better than we do.  \n\n\\* I'm assuming she did because otherwise it'd be an invasive move on her part if she's not living there full-time.", "To be honest, cheating takes a lot of effort, especially with a job, toddler, etc. Most likely be wanted some time to himself. \n\nHe's spent a few days playing baldurs gate 3. He had to buy a new graphics card and doesn't want to tell you it cost 800 dollars. He also doesn't want to admit that he wasn't ill, or was not as seriously ill as mentioned.\n\nThe real issue is why he feels he cannot ask for time to himself with you. Why your mother is checking up on him for you? She likely called out his name rather than checking the rooms, if he had a headset on he wouldn't have heard. She likely didn't check the study, expecting him in bed or lying on the sofa.", "It's usually teenagers.", "It seems like this is almost definitely the case. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s right but I could totally see myself in this situation if I was tired and just needed an excuse to have some alone time. Like, maybe he had diarrhea for real and then just used that to justify staying home and playing a new game.", "This, last time i was balls deep in someone else, i was accused of going camping!!! Its bullshit", "Tbh i don't think this is the reason.\n\nI think he wanted time to himself but knows he was selfish.", "It's not like he'd be in some kind of trouble either, unless he lied about being sick to get out of the trip. It's entirely feasible he started feeling better and decided to meet somebody for lunch, etc. But you don't go full tantrum over that, which makes the whole thing hella suspicious. \n\nETA: Tried to use \"sus\" and my brain felt dirty. Does this mean I'm old?", "I get the feeling that the last paragraph is a driving force here...\n\nBut he could also behave like this islf he's still dealing with baggage like this from childhood or previous relationship.", "Seconding Na, I agree that this could feel like being grilled and could end up being annoyed/angry. It's not as simple as \"Did you go out while I was away\" because OP already has the INFO that her husband was not in the bed she was expecting him to be in because of MIL. Husband probably now has a mentality of \"jesus I can't even sleep in the guest bed where I know MIL will leave me alone for awhile.\" I have also stopped responding to questions that annoy me, until I was able to calm down and collect myself before responding.\n\nDid a physical person search the house and also confirm the car was gone?  \n\nESH, not enough INFO. This sounds like an exhausting marriage.", "I don\u2019t have a problem with that overall\u2026but I\u2019d definitely be pretty angry if I was accused of being missing when I was obviously trapped in the bathroom. What is there to explain??", "Why does MIL need to check on a grown man who didn't ask?  If my wife had her mother check on me, I wouldn't like it.  It's diarrhea.  He doesn't have dysentery.", "I wasn't really addressing OPs story. I was stating the comment I responded to is bullshit", "I could maybe see that for a little while. But diarrhea usually comes in waves. If it were me, once the first wave had passed, I\u2019d get up and go grab my phone real quick so I could just hang out on the pot in case of future urgent moments and wouldn\u2019t be bored. Even if I didn\u2019t do that, if I were sick and had a partner that cared about me who was out of town, I\u2019d text them things like \u201cI\u2019m going to take a nap so if I don\u2019t respond don\u2019t worry about me\u201d or \u201con and off the toilet so if I don\u2019t text back probably pooping\u201d so they wouldn\u2019t worry about me. I can\u2019t see a realistic scenario where he was incommunicado for hours because of diarrhea. Sleeping because he felt tired and weak, maybe, but he stopped responding to her texts AFTER he said he was napping. In context the whole thing is still shady even if he just had a legitimate reason not to take his phone in the bathroom and it isn\u2019t something he usually does.", "Why is her mommy looking for him in the first place? She opened his bedroom door without permission.", "Probably went out to grab food or was hiding from MIL. Seems more plausible to me than pretending to have diarrhea to go see an affair partner. Probably just wasn\u2019t expecting MIL to thoroughly look for him and wife to be asking so many questions.", "I don\u2019t have the guts to ask for my own time so this story resonates. Hope that\u2019s all it is, OP, just him feeling guilty about being selfish but harmless", "Haha you are so spot on with that last part \ud83d\ude02", "That\u2019s the other thing, he\u2019s a tech bro. There\u2019s no way he\u2019d leave a trail. I\u2019d break his trust and abandon my morals for likely nothing. Even if there\u2019s something to find, I\u2019d have to do a lot more than go through his phone to snoop it out and since I\u2019m unwilling to go through his phone I sure af am not going further than that.", "Usually. But I can't be the only one who has found themselves in a situation where they were telling the truth, but it seemed like you were lying. This is for sure something that happens, in fact it's even a sami typical AITA post \"AITA for not believing that my partner didn't cheat?\" \n\nI'm not really making a point about this specific situation though, just using the situation for my point. I'm responding to a comment thread claiming that getting defensive means that they are lying without a doubt 100% and that's just not true. People don't like to be grilled continuously if they are telling the truth. \n\nWe're coming at this from a perspective that he is lying, which I understand because he probably is based on the info given. \n\nBut if it turns out he isn't lying, people will be very quick in defending him being upset about the accusations and continued grilling after he gave his explanations.", "Not necessarily. When you're being cross-examined by a controlling spouse, you don't have to be lying to feel uncomfortable and defensive. I'm not saying that's what's happening here, but it's a thing that happens.", "So he\u2019s a tech genius who would absolutely cover his tracks, but lied about where he was supposedly sleeping and didn\u2019t bother to make the surroundings match the scenario?", "Assuming the story is true, and he was being deceptive, it is possible he just needed some personal time as he is being smothered with an overbearing MIL. Cheating is possible but not necessarily the case.", "I think you are right  - there's two ways this could be toxic: either she's weirdly controlling about things that don't matter, or he's lying about something. From here it's actually not possible to say for sure who is wrong.\n\nEither way, they need to talk it through and get to a healthy agreement, or just file for divorce and get it over with.", "that's when the grilling starts.  If you were asked where were you, and you say \"sleeping\" with no extra details, and then well that doesn't make sense bc MIL was there and you were not there sleeping, and then you come back suddenly with extra details and say, \"oh well I was sleeping in the guest room\" you just added several red flags to your statement.  You have now 1) changed your original story, 2) added details that are contrary to a witnesses accounting of your whereabouts, 3) opened up a new line of questions; so now it's \"why were you sleeping in the guest room\" (this wasn't part of OPs post, but it would be a line of new questioning bc of the lie), and 2) OP gets home to see the guest room bed clearly not having been slept in, unmade mattress, items placed in specific ways on the bed that would be ridiculous to reconstruct unless there was some specific reason, leading OP to ***know*** that he was lying.  I repeat that this is something GUILTY people do.  Innocent people DO NOT just leave details out of a story, and liars NEVER think thoroughly through a lie, esp on the spot.  It's literally what they tell children why they shouldn't lie bc you will never be able to retrace your lies like you can the truth.", "then he would have said he was shitting, and not made up a story about sleeping in a bed that wasn't even his bed and was clearly unmade and had not been altered or slept in.", "I would be furious if I found my partner had looked through my phone, and there is nothing to find there either. BUT it would be a huge violation of my privacy", "Snooping is bad and unhealthy. BUT when things just don\u2019t add up then it\u2019s justified. I wouldn\u2019t fault someone for snooping if there\u2019s a cause but snooping just to keep tabs when you don\u2019t have a reason to suspect anything otherwise is toxic and controlling behavior. \n\nIn this case it is justified.", "You said he wouldn't *find* anything, not that you haven't *done* anything.  \ud83e\udd14", "That's fucked up lol. Invasion of privacy is just acceptable nowadays for sake of the greater good? Nope.", "Snooping is bad because it doesn't occur in a vacuum. For some reason or another, you do not trust your partner. Snooping is a symptom of a larger issue. \n\nAnd before you claim something stupid\u2014 Never cheated, but been cheated on. My partner and I have full access to one another\u2019s phones. He can even face login on mine. The only password of each others we don't have is my work computer, and that's because it's full of sensitive, protected data. There\u2019s no need to snoop, as we 1) trust each other 2) respect one another 3) are open/honest. If there's snooping, at least one of those is no longer present.", "My mom stays in her room most of the time when he\u2019s not working. She doesn\u2019t go downstairs unless she\u2019s doing laundry despite *him* inviting her to bc she wants us to hve space for family time. \n\nThe woman\u2019s not perfect but she\u2019s far from overbearing. And she was there all weekend so if he wanted to get away coming would\u2019ve made more sense. \n\nHe does have frustrations over how long it\u2019s taking to finish her home but if that\u2019s the reason he\u2019s not talking this through w me that would be a really disappointing reason to make this situation so much bigger than needed.", "Here's to hoping that your husband comes clean on whatever he is hiding i. The near future and that it is something benign.", "If he is cheating and you don\u2019t look at his phone or do some digging he can just keep lying to you. I agree the relationship could be over, but that doesn\u2019t mean you won\u2019t still wonder what the truth is/was and he may never tell you. Cheating will haunt you even after you break up, and it\u2019s even worse if all you know is what he told you.", "Agreed and I don't understand the million answers about cheating.\n\nWhere has he actually lied?\n\nIf I told my partner I was sleeping and they start a line of questions out of nowhere, I'd 100% ignore them too. Like if my word isn't good enough then that's a different issue we need to address in our relationship", "If you go snooping through my shit, that relationship is over either way. Either I did do something and you found it, or I didn't and you let your insecurities break the trust, either way I'm not staying."]}
