Your mum just may be wrong (sometimes people just oversee things despite claiming \"I looked everywhere\", she may have forgotten to check the guest room and even if, she may just have taken him covered in some blanket as the usual mess, idk). But his whole reaction, this silent treatment and this avoiding you speaks tons. He is obviously hiding something from you. Either he just wanted to have a game time without kids and made a lame excuse. Or went drinking with buds. Or was gambling. Or made some preaperations for your wedding aniversary (\"Wait, what? It is tomorrow?\"). This are all legit theories without calling the (reasonable) cheating option.

People don't respond well to being treated like criminals, so of course he got defensive. You don't trust him at all.

It just feels so much like the classic response of someone cheating. But ladies I know who know him don\u2019t think he\u2019s capable.
