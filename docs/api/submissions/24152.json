When an innocent person gets asked a question they have NO PROBLEM answering.  They also have NO PROBLEM answering ANY follow up questions, because they aren't sitting there thinking about how to lie about it, they just answer, no issues.  If they get defensive, angry, storm out, bring up other shit that has nothing to do with what they're being grilled about etc, they are FUCKING LYING.  It's every single god damn time.  They think they're slick and want you to leave them alone so they guilt trip you and gaslight you and it's def your fault you MADE them feel so angry (that's what they will tell you).  Huge red red red flags.", "Or accusations are constant, and he's over it.  My ex was paranoid and insanely jealous.  I never cheated on her, but I was grilled every day.  It was insanely frustrating, and I would eventually respond with anger.  This guy only seems shady without any context.", "Typically that's the opposite, innocent people gets rightfully mad when falsely accused.\n\nNow, the fact he doesn't have an answer, is a red flag... but I'm not going to be negative on this one...

Plenty of people who've been cheated on could tell the same story you just did.\n\nHe could still be cheating, but it could also be something else entirely. Either way, his reaction was suspicious and he really needs to explain himself.", "My husband didnt cheat on me sexually but he was meeting up with an ex about once a month for a beer or dinner or a movie or ice skating.... It took him some time to understand why I was so upset, hurt, lost trust when I found out by seeing an open message on his phone.  I knew he would see her once in a while like once every six months but not monthly.  He knew he fucked up and took responsibility but it took some therapy for both of us for him to come around.

Deep breaths.", "To be fair, it could be something as simple as him faking diarrhea so he didn't have to go camping, so he could go do something he wanted instead, and when he got caught he lied.

People get sick of being grilled when they have done nothing.", "So then refusing to acknowledge that said person might be telling the truth and them getting upset because you keep accusing them after they have repeatedly told you what they were doing is also a red flag, right?\n\nCause let's face it, he told her the first time when she asked if he was sleeping, he told her mom he was sleeping, and he told her again he was sleeping.\n\nShe's so hung up that he couldn't have slept in that room because it had no blankets, and shit was where she left it that he must be lying.\n\nI have done the exact same thing as him before, i've taken naps when there was a shirt or other items on top of the bed, without a blanket.\n\nPeople are coming to the worst conclusions on the basis that cheating is more believable than sheer lazyness in the moment.\n\nSo where does he go from there?", "[removed]", "Oh come on.

I wouldn\u2019t even entertain the questioning. If he was out for a walk when the mother was looking for him so what. You can be sick and go for some fresh air. Imagine he was sick from work and they questioned him like this. Accused him of lying because someone told them he wasn\u2019t in bed the whole time. Madness and a little bit controlling.", "Totally agree. I hate the presumption of guilt and it pisses me off. I don't see husband's reaction as an admission of guilt at all.

Lying can be a minor accusation but at the end of the day its an attack on someone's character (guilty or not).\n\nMost people will get pretty defensive when their character is challenged, and rightfully so.  Not saying he's innocent, but to lump ALL accused people who get defensive as liars is ignorant.  \n\nLike police saying that anyone against being strip searched is hiding something.
