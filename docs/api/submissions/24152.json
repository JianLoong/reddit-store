Except for the fact that you\u2019re not", "Well, a different way to put it is that it is reasonable to lose trust in your partner if they\u2019re transparently lying. Everyone is entitled to have their own trust boundaries, no one is entitled to blind faith.", "[removed]", "You\u2019re actually right, the woman deserves an answer, but is she entitled to one? No. She might never get an answer, as so often is the case when dealing with liars.\n\nBut she does deserve the truth and I hope she gets it.", "Hello op:s husband", "Do you have anything significant coming up? A bug birthday/anniversary/other significant date? Could he be planning something?", "It's depressing you have to do that and he wont just answer the simple question that you asked", "Questions are not accusations. If shit doesn\u2019t add up, give me the missing digit so we can all know the right answer.", "Surely he would have done that before? He was probably just avoiding OP", "I do, I don't trust them not to yank it away randomly or to stop supporting whatever software I access it through.", "I'm not dumb enough to get married", "[removed]", "Nope. I just know nobody is going to stop me from giving one", "I think it\u2019s weird he got so defensive. After lying. But I mean just say where you were, dude.", "You're only questioning them because you think they did something. That's an accusation", "Well done, but most don't. My point being I doubt he snuck out to buy a video game when he could have bought one from his bed and nobody would have known.", "Or your attitude keeps potential partners away. Lol", "Tbf a mod could just ban you from commenting", "People could just block you. That would stop you.", "I don\u2019t much care, but I can certainly prevent nonsense like this appearing in my feed.", "Well it\u2019s ok you clearly are alone and nobody cares about your actions so", "[removed]", "That's literally the entire point. The further women are from me the better.", "\ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02 What makes you think I'm a girl?", "I\u2019m sorry that nobody has ever loved you", "LMFAOOO", "\ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude02 Oh my family most definitely loves me. But I'll tell my mom you said that when I go visit her in the morning"]}
