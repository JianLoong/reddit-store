His gf is insecure and taking it out on you", "I think you should have a talk with David about this entire issue.  As it is now, his girlfriend is talking for him, so best you get it directly from him (if there is a problem at all).  NTA.", "NTA - Don't let her insecurities change who you are. Tell your roommate what she said and what you heard. Let him know that she's making you uncomfortable. If he doesn't do anything or takes her side, see about finding a new roommate somewhere else. She doesn't get to run your life.", "NTA. Brianna sounds like a very insecure, controlling, immature, and jealous woman. She obviously doesn't trust David enough. What I think you should is to have a frank talk with David, and make it clear that you have the right to dress the way you want in your home and cook for your friends.  If David respects your feelings, he would talk some sense into Brianna. She is not your roommate, OP. Next time that Brianna says anything, call her out for her insecurities and disrespectful behavior and don't put up with her nonsense.", "NTA You aren't responsible for Brianna's insecurity. You are dressing how you want in your home and how you always have.\n\nShe is not your roommate and if he has a problem with it he should speak up. She should be discussing her issue that involves her relationship with the person she's in a relationship with and then he can talk to you if he wants.", "NTA. This is your home and you should be comfortable in it.", "You're NTA. She doesn't get to dictate how you dress in your own home. If she is that insecure, that's her problem to solve. \n\nAs far as the cooking goes, that's what roommates do. It doesn't have to mean what she seems to think it does.", "NTA. \n\nI know this isn't an advice sub, but FYI you're in a precarious situation. \n\nYou could have David suddenly move out, leaving you on the hook for rent... Or worse, you could have him and his GF turn on you and try to kick you out... Or even worse, this chick could turn psycho on you or David and try to make your lives miserable.", "NTA. It might not be because of how you dress at all. I (23-25F at the time) had a male roommate (27-29M) who was the BEST roommate ever. We had a very big bro relationship. He had a girlfriend who would do the same things. I didn\u2019t dress \u201cprovocatively\u201d and she was still trying to make it out that I was trying to steal him. We cooked for each other because\u2026 well, we both liked cooking, and it\u2019s easier to cook for more folks.\n\nIn any case, insecurities are going to insecure. My experience? I just waited it out. They broke up, I didn\u2019t get involved. I knew and he knew I was leaving after two years (masters program), so like a duck, I just let it roll. Might not be your situation, but I thought I\u2019d throw my two cents in.", "NTA....you be you...dont let petty women distract you from having a good time and a good life.\n\nedit: also you really shouldnt be made to feel uncomfortable in your own home. talk to your roommate, maybe ask if those two can spend less time there...maybe more time at the gf place if sge is going to be so bitchy.", "NTA. You should definitely have a talk with David to tell him what his GF has said and ask if he finds your clothing too provocative. I bet he won't complain about your cooking for him sometimes. :) \n\nTell David that you enjoy having him as a roommate but that you aren't comfortable with his girl and her friends sneering at you and telling you how to dress and behave in your home. Either he will tell her to treat you with more respect or they might end up moving in together. The ball is in his court.", "NTA.  Brianna is lucky you aren't running around in nothing but bra and panties.  Or nothing but panties.  Or see-through nighties.  Or your birthday suit.  It IS your own home, after all.  If you are dressed, meaning not just wearing underwear as outerwear, then this is not your problem.  It is (ironically) David's problem.  His girl is immature, controlling and abusive.   Sadly, it sounds like her whole clan is.  Birds of a feather...", "NTA. For religious reasons, I personally dress more  conservatively, but I don\u2019t judge other people for what they wear, or tell them they can\u2019t dress a certain way around my husband. It sounds like she\u2019s just insecure and taking it out on you.", "OP if you confront David with the situation and he in turn confronts Briana, three potential paths will occur.  Either she'll lie through her teeth and deflect her own insecurities onto you saying that you're trying to break them up because you're really into him; she'll own up to it and tell him that she'll have him choose between you and her which can leave you without a roommate; or she'll just try to make your life a living hell by going there all the time since everything is out in the open.\n\nThe more she thinks she is getting to you, the more she's going to come after you.  Use it to your advantage to ignore her - it works wonders against bullies.", "NTA, don't make adjustments to your life to make some else's more comfortable.", "NTA she needs to get her insecurity under control", "NTA. For fuck's sake, ladies, stop taking your insecurities out on each other. We deal with enough shit as is\u2014we should be lifting each other up, not trying to put each other down.\n\nOP, you should be able to dress as you please (in your own home, for that matter) and perform gestures for your friends without judgment. Your roommate's girlfriend's insecurities are not your problem.", "NTA. Her insecurities aren\u2019t your problem. Your house, you and your roommate make the rules.\n\nMaybe ask him if he\u2019s uncomfortable with the way you dress, and if he is, you can then consider, CONSIDER adapting to accommodate him.", "NTA, she doesn't have a point. You can dress how you like. \n\nYou're a lot less petty than me,  I would have stayed coming for her boyfriend naked or in lingerie after that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

While I agree with seemingly everyone here in that you're not the asshole, I can understand and sympathize with the girlfriend's perspective. Let me explain. \n\nWhile you should feel comfortable to wear what you will in the privacy of your own home, there comes a certain expectation that in communal spaces we generally wear clothing appropriate for the company we keep - and, with your roommate being in a relationship, it would be respectable to wear clothing that isn't particularly revealing; however, you're not necessarily obligated to do so. It's more of mutual compromise for each other's comforts, and this is why I recommended the convo.\n\nSecond, you aren't responsible for alleviating girlfriend's insecurities. If she's unhappy with your appearance because her boyfriend might be tempted to make moves on you, she *might* be off the mark - or, she could have noticed leering or ogling you might not have been aware of. In either case, the fault doesn't lie with you, it lies with them. Again, hard to tell.\n\nLastly, it's a bit much to ask you not to cook for him. You live together, sharing resources - it doesn't make sense for you to suddenly stop doing that. Cooking food is fine.", "Is he going out with some tradwife? Of course you're NTA.", "NTA, it's your apartment too. As long as you're roommate part of dating David will mean reconciling the fact he has a female roommate. It's asinine to ask you to dress up in your own place. If David is your good friend I would bring this up to him. It's not very cool behaviour from his gf.", "NTA\n\nTell David that he needs to have a chat with his GF because you're really not interested in being told how to dress &  that you shouldn't eat meals with your your roommate.  Make it clear that if he's happy,  you're happy for him but she needs to leave you out of their relationship and he needs to explain that you're a roommate,you live there and the  two of you don't try to micromanage each other.", "NTA she's beimg jealous.

Don't let them bring you down", "NTA. Her insecurity and jealousy is not your fault. In fact, you need to speak with your roommate about this.  Ask HIM if he'd like you to stop making him food. \n\nWhat IS slutty anyway? To me, a tank top or crop top, and makeup, is NOT slutty at all.  Don't let her make you feel otherwise.", "NTA. If the GF has an issue she can take it up with David. Your home your rules. Being a good roommate and cooking for every so often is a bonus for that type of relationship. I hope he cooks occasionally for you as well. As for how you dress in the confines or your home is totally up to you. If David brings it up talk it over as see if any compromise can be had. Like a clothes optional rule for both of you. See if she can handle that. Good luck.", "2 words - fuck her! Honestly she needs to take her petty, self conscious, insecure self elsewhere. I hate girls like that omg! You don\u2019t need to change anything!! You just be yourself. Don\u2019t let someone bully you into changing who you are ! Especially in the comfort of your home. Did David tell her he had a roommate who is a woman ahead of time? If not shame on him. If he did then she should have never agreed to date him if he couldn\u2019t handle him having a roommate who is a woman. She feels threatened\u2026 let her feel threatened.", "NTA it's your house too.\n\nI'd bet money your roommate doesn't know about his gfs rant at you.", "NTA", "You can dress however you want in your room, but not in the common areas.

It almost looks like your conscious is fighting your subconscious. Your conscious knows David has someone in his life, you guys are roommates, and good friends, so a \u2018fling\u2019 with David may not be rational and moral. On the other hand, your subconscious fantasies a romantic moment between you and David, but David may not share the same feelings as you, hence, the \u2018revealing\u2019 outfits and the \u2018friendly\u2019 cooking.

Like, coming out of the bathroom or whatever, it's unavoidable.   \n\n\nBut yeah, compromises don't dictate what someone decides to put on their body. This said, I'm going to walk down the hallway today swinging my dick around making it wear a little origami hat because nobody has a right to tell me what to put on my body.", "Is the hallway in your own home? If so, good for you!", "OP is renting the house with her roommate, so it is not her \u2018own\u2019 house, it is their house. I am pretty sure dressing inappropriately in common areas can be grounds for eviction, depending on the province/state you reside in."]}
