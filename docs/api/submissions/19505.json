We didn\u2019t know each other when we moved in, but we were introduced by a mutual friend and he\u2019s been the best roommate I\u2019ve ever had and we\u2019ve also become good friends. \n\nA couple months ago, David started dating Brianna and bringing her around our place. Mostly they hang out in David\u2019s room, but I\u2019ve always been friendly with Brianna when she\u2019s over, though I\u2019ve always felt that she\u2019s a little icy towards me. \n\nA few weeks ago though she pulled me aside while David was outside and asked me if I could be more \u201cchill\u201d. I was a little taken aback and told her i didn\u2019t know what she meant, and she told me that I was being a pick me by dressing \u201cslutty\u201d around David - which is honestly kind of fair, I wear a lot of tank tops/crop tops that are on the more revealing side and I like to do my makeup. She also said that she thought it was disrespectful that I cook for him sometimes because he\u2019s \u201cnot my man\u201d. I told her that I had no intention of trying to steal her man or of inserting myself into their relationship, I just dress the way I like to dress and I like cooking for my friends. \n\nI thought that was the end of it, but last night we had a small party at our place and I saw Brianna and two of her friends I hadn\u2019t met before talking while they looked at me. I didnt hear the full context but I distinctly heard one of them say \u201cI see what you mean\u201d in a kind of sneering tone as I passed by, and it almost sounded like she wanted me to hear it. Since then I\u2019ve been feeling really self-conscious and I\u2019m worried that maybe I should change the way I dress. \n\nAITA?\n\n**Edit:** Thanks for all the responses, I did not expect so much support and honestly feel kind of undeserving \ud83e\udd7a I\u2019m going to talk to David later today like you all suggested and make sure that he isn\u2019t uncomfortable, but in the meantime I\u2019ll try to answer some of the info requests. \n\nFirst, I do not and have never had any feelings for David, and we\u2019ve never kissed or anything like that. (I\u2019m no genius but im not dumb enough to sleep with my roommate.) I can be a little flirty with my friends sometimes and I\u2019ve sat in his lap once or twice as a joke (something I\u2019ve done with most of my friends, guys and girls), but that was before he met Brianna. As far as I know he doesnt have any feelings for me either and our relationship is platonic. \n\nSecond, a few people asked for more details about what type of outfits I\u2019m talking about, and mostly in the summers I wear tops that are on the tighter side and are pretty cropped with either short shorts or a micro mini or baggy pants. I also will wear athletic wear if I\u2019m going to be at the gym later. I can post similar examples on my profile if my phone will let me. (Posted!)\n\nFinally, some people asked why I cook for David sometimes, and I forgot to mention that he cooks for me too, so it\u2019s not a one-way street. It\u2019s not a super common thing either, just that sometimes we like to eat dinner together or sometimes one of us will make extra food and offer the other some.\n\n**Edit 2**: I talked to David and I\u2019m not sure how to feel about things. The way I phrased things was basically \u201cHey, Brianna and I spoke recently and I wanted to make sure that the way I dress doesn\u2019t make you uncomfortable.\u201d He said that he personally didn\u2019t have an issue with it, but did say that Brianna had mentioned it to him before and has expressed that she feels like the way I dress isn\u2019t respectful to their relationship. He then said that I\u2019m not obligated to change the way I dress, but that if I could tone it down a bit it\u2019s make his life easier. I was a little annoyed and asked him what I was supposed to \u201ctone down\u201d and he mentioned the way I sometimes wear low waisted (I think he meant low-rise) pants that let the straps of my thong show. He also brought up how some of my halter tops are a little showy (examples on my profile - though fyi those are not pics of me they\u2019re from Shein), which honestly I agree, but also it\u2019s not like I just wear that stuff lounging around the house, it\u2019s usually because I\u2019ve been out with friends or I\u2019m going out later. Anyway I kind of get where he\u2019s coming from and I don\u2019t want to cause problems in his relationship, but I also agree with what a lot of people said that I should be allowed to dress how I want in my living space as long as I\u2019m not like naked.", "created_utc": 1686448299, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146hfu3/aita_for_dressing_slutty_around_my_male_roommate/", "score": 2109, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If David respects your feelings, he would talk some sense into Brianna. She is not your roommate, OP. Next time that Brianna says anything, call her out for her insecurities and disrespectful behavior and don't put up with her nonsense.", "NTA You aren't responsible for Brianna's insecurity. You are dressing how you want in your home and how you always have.\n\nShe is not your roommate and if he has a problem with it he should speak up.

Or worse, you could have him and his GF turn on you and try to kick you out... Or even worse, this chick could turn psycho on you or David and try to make your lives miserable.", "NTA. It might not be because of how you dress at all. I (23-25F at the time) had a male roommate (27-29M) who was the BEST roommate ever. We had a very big bro relationship. He had a girlfriend who would do the same things. I didn\u2019t dress \u201cprovocatively\u201d and she was still trying to make it out that I was trying to steal him. We cooked for each other because\u2026 well, we both liked cooking, and it\u2019s easier to cook for more folks.\n\nIn any case, insecurities are going to insecure. My experience? I just waited it out. They broke up, I didn\u2019t get involved. I knew and he knew I was leaving after two years (masters program), so like a duck, I just let it roll.

I bet he won't complain about your cooking for him sometimes. :) \n\nTell David that you enjoy having him as a roommate but that you aren't comfortable with his girl and her friends sneering at you and telling you how to dress and behave in your home.

For religious reasons, I personally dress more  conservatively, but I don\u2019t judge other people for what they wear, or tell them they can\u2019t dress a certain way around my husband. It sounds like she\u2019s just insecure and taking it out on you.", "OP if you confront David with the situation and he in turn confronts Briana, three potential paths will occur.  Either she'll lie through her teeth and deflect her own insecurities onto you saying that you're trying to break them up because you're really into him; she'll own up to it and tell him that she'll have him choose between you and her which can leave you without a roommate; or she'll just try to make your life a living hell by going there all the time since everything is out in the open.\n\nThe more she thinks she is getting to you, the more she's going to come after you.

While I agree with seemingly everyone here in that you're not the asshole, I can understand and sympathize with the girlfriend's perspective. Let me explain. \n\nWhile you should feel comfortable to wear what you will in the privacy of your own home, there comes a certain expectation that in communal spaces we generally wear clothing appropriate for the company we keep - and, with your roommate being in a relationship, it would be respectable to wear clothing that isn't particularly revealing; however, you're not necessarily obligated to do so. It's more of mutual compromise for each other's comforts, and this is why I recommended the convo.\n\nSecond, you aren't responsible for alleviating girlfriend's insecurities. If she's unhappy with your appearance because her boyfriend might be tempted to make moves on you, she *might* be off the mark - or, she could have noticed leering or ogling you might not have been aware of. In either case, the fault doesn't lie with you, it lies with them. Again, hard to tell.\n\nLastly, it's a bit much to ask you not to cook for him.

Flatmates don't get to decide what other flatmates wear. Don't like it, move out.", "Actually it could be her problem. If she took your stance, it could potentially cause more drama than its worth. It could cause a rift in her friendship. Cause her friend a problem in his relationship. All of which could turn what should be their safe space into a place of turmoil. This is why everyone advises talking to the roommate. If it is making him a little uncomfortable, then she can choose to be considerate of his feelings. That's what is known as maturity. \n\nNow on to your argument of her home, her body. She isn't the only one paying for the right to live there. He is, too. Inside her room, she can do as she pleases, as can he inside his own room. Within the shared living space, it's best to be considerate of those you share it with. That's the way to keep the peace. If she wishes for her roommate to be considerate of her, then she needs to respond in kind. \n\nFinally, to the part where you say that the girlfriend should just get over her insecurities.

They do it for themselves because their self esteem is so low that they think it's the only way to get attention from a man. \n\nThey don't realize that men actually prefer that there be something left to the imagination. Men and people in general will respect you more for not putting everything on display. It's called class and some people haven't learned that. If she's looking for a man, she should look elsewhere and learn how to conduct herself. If she had a boyfriend, I don't think he would appreciate her dressing like that in front of his male friends and certainly not his family. \n\nShe should act like a lady. Be kind to him and his friends and family and learn how to dress appropriately for the situation, don't be letting everything hang out. Like it or not, men still choose women who are kind and carry themselves with class. They can scream *pick me girl* all day long but in reality, they're just mad at those women for having what they want. They know that the problem lies with them but they'll never acknowledge it. \n\nThis is because then *horror* they would actually have to work on changing. It's easier to attack the person who they want to be like and try to destroy them for having what they want instead of doing any work on themselves. Then they brigade on the women who refuse to stoop to their level and jump on their bandwagon. I'm all for equality and women's rights but not when it's a fancy label for *I should be able to do whatever I want and never be questioned about it.*\n\n *I don't have to have respect for the well being of others and their relationships because I'm a woman damnit!* *If anyone tells me I'm wrong well then, they're either sexist or a pick me girl.* I got away from myself but I'm tired of people like OP.

It must be that I come from a generation where not everything is instant gratification and we actually show respect for one another. I would never even think to dress like that in front of my friends' men. They're men and they're going to look. It's disrespectful to do that in front of another woman's man.\n\n Hell, it's disrespectful to your man to dress that way in front of his male friends. I know how to conduct myself in front of my boyfriend's friends. Clearly OP and a lot of other people think that she should be able to do whatever she wants and not have to deal with people calling her out on it. I don't care what anyone says, it's disrespectful.

Can we please stop excusing the actions of men as if they have no control over themselves and are slaves to their hormones and genitalia? \n\nOP is allowed to dress how she wants in the comfort of her own home. It is on her roommate to keep control of his own eyes. Social norms dictate that you look whomever you're having a conversation with, in the eyes. If they're not directly speaking, roommate can just not look. It's literally as simple as that. \n\nIf OP's roommate can't keep his eyes to himself, maybe his girlfriend should take up his actions with HIM, rather than blaming his innocent bystander roommate.", "This is such sexist bullshit it\u2019s insane. Wearing a tank top in front of a man with a partner is not disrespectful. What\u2019s disrespectful is expecting women to dress differently around you because you have a partner, especially in your own home. If they look at you that\u2019s not your problem, it theirs.

I hate the wording girlfriend used, but the message seemed clear enough to me. \n\n>Tell me that your knowledge of the dynamics between sexes is stuck in the 1950\u2019s without telling me. \n\nMa'am I grew up with Britney Spears. What OP described as her leisure wear wouldn't bother me. I'm just also emotionally mature enough to recognize \"please don't have your boobs out in front of my boyfriend\" as a reasonable request, which is what this came off as to me.
