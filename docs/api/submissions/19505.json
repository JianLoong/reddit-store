Tell your roommate what she said and what you heard. Let him know that she's making you uncomfortable. If he doesn't do anything or takes her side, see about finding a new roommate somewhere else. She doesn't get to run your life.", "NTA. Brianna sounds like a very insecure, controlling, immature, and jealous woman. She obviously doesn't trust David enough. What I think you should is to have a frank talk with David, and make it clear that you have the right to dress the way you want in your home and cook for your friends.  If David respects your feelings, he would talk some sense into Brianna. She is not your roommate, OP. Next time that Brianna says anything, call her out for her insecurities and disrespectful behavior and don't put up with her nonsense.", "NTA You aren't responsible for Brianna's insecurity. You are dressing how you want in your home and how you always have.\n\nShe is not your roommate and if he has a problem with it he should speak up. She should be discussing her issue that involves her relationship with the person she's in a relationship with and then he can talk to you if he wants.", "NTA. This is your home and you should be comfortable in it.", "You're NTA. She doesn't get to dictate how you dress in your own home. If she is that insecure, that's her problem to solve. \n\nAs far as the cooking goes, that's what roommates do. It doesn't have to mean what she seems to think it does.", "NTA. \n\nI know this isn't an advice sub, but FYI you're in a precarious situation. \n\nYou could have David suddenly move out, leaving you on the hook for rent... Or worse, you could have him and his GF turn on you and try to kick you out... Or even worse, this chick could turn psycho on you or David and try to make your lives miserable.", "NTA. It might not be because of how you dress at all. I (23-25F at the time) had a male roommate (27-29M) who was the BEST roommate ever. We had a very big bro relationship. He had a girlfriend who would do the same things. I didn\u2019t dress \u201cprovocatively\u201d and she was still trying to make it out that I was trying to steal him. We cooked for each other because\u2026 well, we both liked cooking, and it\u2019s easier to cook for more folks.\n\nIn any case, insecurities are going to insecure. My experience? I just waited it out. They broke up, I didn\u2019t get involved. I knew and he knew I was leaving after two years (masters program), so like a duck, I just let it roll. Might not be your situation, but I thought I\u2019d throw my two cents in.", "NTA....you be you...dont let petty women distract you from having a good time and a good life.\n\nedit: also you really shouldnt be made to feel uncomfortable in your own home. talk to your roommate, maybe ask if those two can spend less time there...maybe more time at the gf place if sge is going to be so bitchy.", "NTA. You should definitely have a talk with David to tell him what his GF has said and ask if he finds your clothing too provocative. I bet he won't complain about your cooking for him sometimes. :) \n\nTell David that you enjoy having him as a roommate but that you aren't comfortable with his girl and her friends sneering at you and telling you how to dress and behave in your home.

Brianna is lucky you aren't running around in nothing but bra and panties.  Or nothing but panties.  Or see-through nighties.  Or your birthday suit.  It IS your own home, after all.  If you are dressed, meaning not just wearing underwear as outerwear, then this is not your problem.  It is (ironically) David's problem.  His girl is immature, controlling and abusive.   Sadly, it sounds like her whole clan is.  Birds of a feather...", "NTA. For religious reasons, I personally dress more  conservatively, but I don\u2019t judge other people for what they wear, or tell them they can\u2019t dress a certain way around my husband. It sounds like she\u2019s just insecure and taking it out on you.", "OP if you confront David with the situation and he in turn confronts Briana, three potential paths will occur.  Either she'll lie through her teeth and deflect her own insecurities onto you saying that you're trying to break them up because you're really into him; she'll own up to it and tell him that she'll have him choose between you and her which can leave you without a roommate; or she'll just try to make your life a living hell by going there all the time since everything is out in the open.\n\nThe more she thinks she is getting to you, the more she's going to come after you.  Use it to your advantage to ignore her - it works wonders against bullies.", "NTA, don't make adjustments to your life to make some else's more comfortable.", "NTA she needs to get her insecurity under control", "NTA. For fuck's sake, ladies, stop taking your insecurities out on each other. We deal with enough shit as is\u2014we should be lifting each other up, not trying to put each other down.\n\nOP, you should be able to dress as you please (in your own home, for that matter) and perform gestures for your friends without judgment. Your roommate's girlfriend's insecurities are not your problem.", "NTA. Her insecurities aren\u2019t your problem. Your house, you and your roommate make the rules.\n\nMaybe ask him if he\u2019s uncomfortable with the way you dress, and if he is, you can then consider, CONSIDER adapting to accommodate him.", "NTA, she doesn't have a point.

While I agree with seemingly everyone here in that you're not the asshole, I can understand and sympathize with the girlfriend's perspective. Let me explain. \n\nWhile you should feel comfortable to wear what you will in the privacy of your own home, there comes a certain expectation that in communal spaces we generally wear clothing appropriate for the company we keep - and, with your roommate being in a relationship, it would be respectable to wear clothing that isn't particularly revealing; however, you're not necessarily obligated to do so. It's more of mutual compromise for each other's comforts, and this is why I recommended the convo.\n\nSecond, you aren't responsible for alleviating girlfriend's insecurities. If she's unhappy with your appearance because her boyfriend might be tempted to make moves on you, she *might* be off the mark - or, she could have noticed leering or ogling you might not have been aware of. In either case, the fault doesn't lie with you, it lies with them. Again, hard to tell.\n\nLastly, it's a bit much to ask you not to cook for him.

Of course you're NTA.", "NTA, it's your apartment too. As long as you're roommate part of dating David will mean reconciling the fact he has a female roommate.

If the GF has an issue she can take it up with David. Your home your rules. Being a good roommate and cooking for every so often is a bonus for that type of relationship. I hope he cooks occasionally for you as well. As for how you dress in the confines or your home is totally up to you. If David brings it up talk it over as see if any compromise can be had.

It could cause a rift in her friendship. Cause her friend a problem in his relationship. All of which could turn what should be their safe space into a place of turmoil.

Humans are insecure creatures. Even yourself. Humans are especially insecure when it comes to newer relationships. Some may be reasonable while others may seem a bit outlandish, but they're there.

I don\u2019t it would be fair.\n\nNow if in that hypothetical the issue is raised, it isn\u2019t OP being sexist against this guy necessarily.", "She is not doing anything.\n\nThis is why there is rape culture! \n\nShe can dress any way she likes!", "Or you could deal with the fact that you didn't trust your boyfriend ? No one has to control what they wear so that your boyfriend doesn't stare  or behave inappropriately . If he cannot control himself , that's on him", "No it's obvious that you are approaching this as if the partner is some sort of uncontrollable beast that cannot avoid staring at people, and have projected something from your own world onto this . In no way has she said anything that makes her sound like a jealous ex girlfriend . She's told Briana she will dress as she pleases in her own home . Briana is clearly uncomfortable in her relationship and does not trust her partner . If you have a boyfriend that you cannot trust not to behave inappropriately, then that's a boyfriend problem. If he wants to stare at women , there is a whole ass world and internet full of them , he will be able to look at anything and everything he wants to , and he is not a possession . He can do what he pleases , and Briana can decide what she find acceptable in behaviour for her relationship . \n\nStop excusing men behaving badly and saying \" it's the woman's fault for wearing a crop top \". No , if your boyfriend looks at other women , and you don't like that and have told him so , then it's his behaviour that's the problem not the woman just living her life in whatever clothes she wants to", "Are you the rommates gf?", "It\u2019s not so hard for the roommate to keep his eyes to himself, either, is it?", "So when OP goes to a beach she should not wear a bikini because other peoples partners might be there ? If other people's relationships are so weak that they think a crop top might cause them to cheat on them , that's on Briana and her boyfriend , not OP .", "Then I hope they will never go to a beach or festival where many people walk around like that. Not everyone is constantly trying to seduce people. Some people prefer not to be all covered up and sweaty. If you're so insecure a belly would put you in a negative spiral regarding someone, you are the problem", "If he is looking when he is in a relationship, that\u2019s on him. Not her. That\u2019s the same as telling a woman she was asking for it because of how she was dressed.", "yeah same, people are allowed to have their preferences but waltzing into someones life expecting them to change major things is dumb", "This! OP should definitely talk to David, he\u2019s her friend & roommate. OP isn\u2019t going to move out of lose David as a roommate because his gf is extremely insecure. The acuity the gf has to try to control you & how you dress in your own home is crazy. OP is very nice & polite, because I\u2019d have said something awful to that insecure gf.", "I came here to say this.\n\nAlso, happy cake day.", "or OP should just go for roommate.", "And if Briana has an issue with you she can spend less time at your place", "Haven't you seen those tiktoks where women call their boyfriends gay for preferring to hang out with male friends instead of holding her purse while she shops?\nThe worst of these women even rant about \"red flags\" when their boyfriend, say, hugs his dad with tears in their eyes when the dad passes on an heirloom watch or something", "Yeah, its just sad. Like, you are so insecure about your self and your relationship that you can stand to see your partner have any other kind of physical or emotional interaction with anyone else. Cause if they do, they might realize how little you have to offer.\n\nSome people are just too much.", "And you may as well announce that you are insecure as hell", "Insert enormous eye roll here.", "A woman can dress however she wants in front of ant man, as long as he is not uncomfortable with it. Atop being so grossly insecure please, or get hotter so you stop feeling threatened", "Remember? We\u2019re taught this from grade school!\n\nCan\u2019t show shoulders because it\u2019ll distract the boys.\n\nCan\u2019t show legs above the knees because it\u2019ll distract the boys.\n\nCan\u2019t show your navel because it\u2019ll distract the boys.", "Having dealt with this kind of person before, I can assure you that OP changing the way she dresses will only confirm in Brianna's mind that she's \"after\" David. Giving into jealous people just makes them double down. Soon it'll be 'you can't be alone in the apartment with David'.", ">provocatively\n\nThere's your problem, right there. You think that dress is a reason for infidelity. Do you think it's the cause of sexual assaults too?", "Ah nah, it's certainly unreasonable and being a insecure girl.", "If you have to twist yourself in knots to keep your partner from falling for someone else because her belly is exposed, you may want to reevaluate how things are going.", "Yea it does. Crop tops are casual wear, it\u2019s not like she\u2019s wearing a bra and only a bra all around their place\u2026 crop tops are fine.", "You\u2018d rather police someones dressing instead of finding a partner who isnt tempted the moment he sees something vaguely promiscuous?", "How is a wearing a crop top disrespectful to someone\u2019s relationship? She has no feelings for her roommate except friend ones. What is she suppose to wear? It\u2019s not like she has her tits all the way out.. geeze"]}
