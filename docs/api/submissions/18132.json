You have absolutely no obligation to give her money. Ever. In fact, in light of the way she's treated you, I'd recommend laying down a firm boundary that you are not an ATM and you will not give/lend money to her under any circumstance. She's 27, not 17. She needs to take responsibility for her own life. And her and your mom bashing you online? Pathetic.", "NTA. Your sister can go and live with her mum if she can\u2019t afford stuff, even better how about your mum and your dad help her out (not that they are obliged to). But they should be the ones to bail out your sister, not you.", "NTA. let the sister drown in her own incompetence. Once things cool, talk to your mom and explain your side. Your sister is older than you and more than capable of living with the consequences of her actions.", "NTA\n\nYour sisters issues are not your problem. She seems to have options, and you are not under any obligation to bail her out.\n\nHer being homeless would be her own fault; and you not helping will further the point that her current lifestyle isn\u2019t feasible.\n\nSome people need to hit rock bottom to actually learn anything, and someone living in a luxury apartment, with a BMW, that cannot manage their finances, is not spending their money well.\n\nContinue to work on your future, and worry about yourself first.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \"No\" is a complete answer that requires no justification. \nYour sister has several solutions in front of her (move to a smaller apartment, sell her car to get a cheaper one, go live with her dear mother...).\nShe refuses all solutions that would impact her standard of living. She prefers that others ruin themselves for her. \nLeave her in the misery she created for herself and enjoy your new MacBook.", "NTA.  There's a lot more issues here than 'I bought a laptop instead of paying my sister's rent.'  If you paid the rent now, how would she pay it next month?  She needs a better plan, and the fact that they're both trashing you on social media like junior high mean girls just adds to the stupidity.   I strongly believe in family helping each other, but you do not owe your sister a lifestyle she can't otherwise afford, especially since she doesn't seem to be doing anything to improve her own situation.", "\n\nNTA - Not The A**hole. You are not obligated to use your own money to pay your sister's rent and you had already set aside money to buy a new laptop for your studies. This purchase was a responsible and reasonable decision, and your sister and mother's angry reactions are unfair and unwarranted.", "\"AITA for refusing to bail my sister out from the consequences of her actions\"\n\nFixed it for you.\n\nNTA.\n\nIt's time to make a counter Facebook post. \"I heard this unsettling rumor going around and I want to set it right\" type thing.", "NTA\n\nTell your mom that when she\u2019s ready to hear the truth, you\u2019ll be ready to explain it to her.\n\nBlock your sister altogether.", "NTA\n\nYour sister isn\u2019t your responsibility. Of course you could help her out again, but this would only mean she probably struggle again next month. She\u2019s an adult, she needs to figure out a way to pay her bills herself.\n\nAlso, your father offered some help. It\u2019s actually her problem if she doesn\u2019t like it.", "NTA.\n\nNot even a little. Your sis and mum are though. If you feel so inclined, you can comment on their posts that she turned down an offer of free housing with you and your dad. She's a choosing beggar. Also, why can't your mum help her if she's so concerned?", "You should stop helping these awful people. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\n> and refused to move in with him despite his offers.\n\nHe is making an offer within his means. It also means if she ends up being homeless, it\u2019s a choice as there is an offer of housing on the table.\n\nWhat she wants is someone to fund an extravagant lifestyle - refusing to do so even if you have the money is reasonable.\n\nSelfish is refusing to get a job, refusing to cut back spending, then berating family for spending their own money on their own things and lying to another family member in order to recruit them.\n\nAnd the money spent on a 2022 macbook pro would not have saved her anyway - you would have just been burning money.\n\nHopefully your mom comes to her damn senses, but it\u2019s gotta still hurt that she immediately believed your sister and then engaged in behavior to smear your reputation with family and friends.\n\nYour sister is not entitled to your money. No sibling should be expected to be a financial resource for another, ESPECIALLY when that sibling can easily downsize their life but refuse to do so.", "NTA you don't owe your sister your money and quite frankly I'd stop giving the bum money period", "NTA.\n\nIt's baffling how your sister is behaving. Despite having someone offering help, she just could not put down her ego and take it. I honestly think she doesn't want the solution to her problem because she likes this whole \"victim\" act and wants to prolong it so that she doesn't actually have to do the actual work.\n\nPlease put up some boundaries and stand your ground. This behaviour is unacceptable.", "NTA. Yikes, sucks that your family has turned on you like that. It's especially weird your own mother is bashing you on Facebook. I don't judge your sister for being in a bad financial situation, but calling you selfish for not giving her your hard-earned savings? It's probably time to go no-contact with those family members and let them learn the hard way.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You\u2019re providing better solutions than simply paying her because who\u2019s to say that it won\u2019t continue?
