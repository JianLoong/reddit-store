She prefers that others ruin themselves for her. \nLeave her in the misery she created for herself and enjoy your new MacBook.", "NTA.  There's a lot more issues here than 'I bought a laptop instead of paying my sister's rent.'  If you paid the rent now, how would she pay it next month?

She doesn't get along with him, you live there, she would be going from full independence to living at home again, and it would feel like a horrible failure and isn't anything she wants. So dad repeated doing nothing but offering to let her move in? Doing way more harm than good.

It's better for your sister to be housed and safely independent than to be right or rub it in her face.\n\nSince your dad won't give her any money and she won't live with him, I would recommend suggesting he change tactics and offer to pay for her to meet with a financial counselor for a few sessions, which is common and recommended for people after divorces, so it's very appropriate here. Maybe you could suggest mom offer to apartment shop and the like, since it would be better to find a place *now* before she gets an eviction on her history.\n\nIf you guys fail to offer help that is actually helpful, I can see her latching on to the first guy with an apartment who shows interest and winding up in a very bad situation. \n\nThis shouldn't be your circus or your monkeys--but you purposely inserted yourself so that excuse won't fly.

Block her all over the place.", "NTA  I would screen shot what you posted here and attach it under the comments of all your mom's posts that bash you.", "NTA \u2026 not your responsibility to pick up her slack . Since yo mama got so much to say tell her to help her . Don\u2019t feel bad for not helping \u203c\ufe0f", "NTA respond on social media and answer her if she can't afford rent she needs to find an Appartment she can afford that you are not her slave and you don't have to support her luxury life.\n\nAlso tell your mom if she's so worried about a 37 !!! Y o SHE can get money out of her saving account and pay your sister s rent. After all your Mom is her parent not you. \n\n\nETA the judgement and respose would be valid if you didn't need anything for school and you just weren't in the mood to hand over your hard earned money.", "NTA.  You're continuing your education and need certain things like a computer. You are investing in your own future. Your dad is assisting you by letting you live rent free to save. Awesome dad imo. \n\nHelping your sister is not a solution to her problems.  It's a poor investment and she'll just keep coming back to ask for more. Helping your mother enables your sister. Cut them both off. Let your sister find her own solutions.  They can always move in together.", "babe law school is stressful enough. do not add anymore to your plate. NTA, time to go NC she doesn\u2019t want help she wants to be carried.", "OP - you are NOT in a position to help. You are in a position to enable. You chose not to do that and got something you needed for your education. NTA.", "NTA.  You position should be far far away from your Mom and sister.   Mom continues to enable sister with this behavior.  Neither see the fault.", "i \\*do\\* judge the sister for her sitch. Sell the BMW or get out of the lease. Find a way to get out of the apt lease or get a roommate. Get a better (or any?) job.\n\nIt's not like she can't afford a beater car, she can't afford a $700 luxury car. I have ZERO sympathy for people like that who don't immediately start selling off luxuries when they're in dire financial straits.", "Your mom is lying about you online, why are you helping her?", "NTA\n\nYou help both your mum and sister financially, but they both feel happy to attack you verbally, and then trash you on social media whenever you stop being their ATM?\n\nWhy are still in contact with either of them? They're awful and they don't respect you at all. Block them on everything for a few months and see if your quality of life improves. I'm betting it will.\n\nIf you miss them after this, perhaps consider a low contact relationship with a strict rule of no discussion of money, at all, ever.", "Honestly, you need to stop sending money to either of them.  You're helping to enable this by giving money.  Your dad knows this.  That's why he stopped, and left your mom.  You need to stop as well.  NTA", "As soon as they bashed your family on socials that would've been my queue to close the wallet. Giving either of them anything is rewarding the assholes.", "Especially since mom is also bashing her on social media.", "Maybe it's cold, but I don't feel like OP should give either of them money anymore. Just shut it all down. \"Love me because we're family, not because you need someone to subsidize your life.\" They both need adulting lessons."]}
