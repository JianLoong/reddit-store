You helped me last time so I\u2019m back again.\n\nI (mid 20\u2019s F) lost my best friend a little over a year ago. Since then, I adopted a senior dog from the shelter named Benton. He\u2019s a almost 9yo German Shepard. He was an owner surrender and is dog reactive.\n\nAnyways, this happened yesterday morning. The town I live in has a pretty nice dog park. It has a big yard for groups of dogs and smaller pens for individual pets. I typically bring him on Mondays and Thursdays in the morning as it\u2019s the most empty then.\n\nI would say 9/10 times it\u2019s empty or at least one individual pen is available. However, yesterday the two individual pens were occupied but the big yard was open. Benton wears a harness with \u2018REACTIVE\u2019 clearly visible. \n\nSince the large pen was empty, I unleashed him and started throwing his ball for him to chase. I would say about 20 minutes later a woman 20-30s was bringing her dog to the entrance of the pen where I was sitting. \n\nAt that point, I let her know that my dog was reactive and asked if she would wait a couple minutes so I could get him leashed up and out the other gate. This is when things got confusing. \n\nThe woman started to -not yell but not talk politely either- say that I shouldn\u2019t bring an aggressive dog to a dog park. I was just trying to deescalate and let her know that I was getting my dog as fast as possible and that she would have the large pen shortly.\n\nShe huffed and walked a few feet away. I got Benton and we left but I could hear her call me a B**** when we walked past.\n\nAnyways, AITA?", "created_utc": 1676076420, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10z7vuq/aita_for_bringing_my_reactive_dog_to_a_dog_park/", "score": 3266, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's one of the rules. My husband had to stop someone from walking in with their dog that was in heat once. Usually the smaller pens are for small dogs, so unless they're there for individual use, you shouldn't use them.\n\nYou could work on socializing on the outside of the gate provided you are fully in physical control of your dog. You could also go to the enclosed baseball diamonds at some parks as long as you absolutely, no exceptions, clean up any poop.\n\nYou could also go to specialized socialization classes through local training facilities where professionals are on hand to keep everyone safe.", "As someone whose dog has been attacked by a reactive dog at a dog park, no matter how careful you think you're being, there's always a risk. You can't focus on everything at once, and you could miss someone coming in if there are multiple gates. If you have a reactive dog and there's no individual area open, then you wait until there is.

People bringing reactive dogs to off-leash areas is why most people who work at vets won't go near dog parks. I had a reactive dog for 14 years, I wished I could do those things but knew it wasn't possible.", "YTA I\u2019ve had reactive dogs, you do NOT risk them or others. If the individual pens weren\u2019t available you really should have just moved on and came back later/another day. What if you didn\u2019t notice the woman in time to warn her? What if she didn\u2019t hear you? If you knowingly take on the extra responsibility of owning an aggressive dog you HAVE to always make safety your number one concern.", "I\u2019m sorry but yah YTA.\n\nI have a dog who was reactive when he was younger (also a Shepard but a malinois not a German Shepard) I knew better then to bring him to a dog park because a reactive dog can actually traumatize other dogs. The way I socialized him is I off leash trained him and took him hiking on less frequented trails. Over time this was enough exposure to work up to more. \n\nYou really need to be more considerate. It\u2019s not just YOUR dog. \n\nThe other thing to remember is that dog parks are the literal worst. This is a horrible place for any dog to go to, let alone a reactive dog. I highly recommend talking to a dog trainer or even your vet about this.", "YTA as a rule abider - if your dog really can\u2019t be trusted off leash and none of the individual pens were available, you risked exactly the reaction you got\n\nCan I ask about why you losing a friend and the adopting the dog are connected for you in the telling of this story? Is there a blindspot when it comes to the dog because of this?\n\nIf so, maybe you aren\u2019t so sensitive to doggo being a reactive dog so much as something you need to protect. And other people without the emotional connection may need to protect their dogs, even if you have to spend minutes corralling it from a large area, from yours.\n\n(\u2665\ufe0f you lost your chihuahua and I just want to share good vibes, I know you were just doing what you could for your new old dude. Reactive dogs need love and playtime too. This lady gave you the business, but keep loving dogs, even if this park isn\u2019t the right one for him. Now I feel tearful!)", "YTA I have two reactive dogs and they don\u2019t go anywhere near unleashed dogs or be unleashed themselves, unless in a private yard alone. You set yourself and your dog up for failure. You\u2019re going to get someone\u2019s dog or yours attacked.", "Sorry but YTA.\n\nReactive dogs do not belong in a dog park, it is stressful them, for you, for other owners, for other dogs. It doesn't matter if the public park was empty when you got there; by putting Benton in there, you basically make a public space private, or unsafe, or both.\n\nI have a GSD who sometimes can get ball possessive, so I am sympathetic, but reactive dogs really should not ever be in an open dog park. Especially a big breed like a GSD. C'mon, you know the breed's \"reputation,\" this was bound to go badly and potentially cause harm to other dogs, or trouble for Benton in his senior years. Think about it... a big aggressive breed in an open pen with a REACTIVE vest on is like putting a billboard up for \"my dog is an accident waiting to happen\" and not going to win you any friends, no matter how conscientious I think you were trying to be. I'm not sure what experience you have had with GSDs, or if you knew the specifics of Benton's reactivity, but I assume you knew (or should have known) that signing up for a reactive dog equals less freedom for the dog until you are able to perform remedial training to create safer interactions.\n\nAlso, the \"reactive\" vest I do not think has the impact you think it does. One, in a dog park, it immediately labels you a villain (because the dog should not be there). Two, it puts the onus on other owners to manage their nonreactive dogs to keep them away from yours, when it's YOU who should be managing yours (by not being there) -- since dogs cannot understand English. I admit, if I was that lady, I'd be pissed off too. Your dog is reactive, in violation of public park rules and more importantly common sense. If someone quickly slipped into the park without your knowledge or a conversation... that could have led to an interaction, a fight, and possibly a bite record for your dog.\n\nI mean this with kindness, but please do not bring this dog to the dog park again. Dog parks are already a hot mess, but the saying goes that one dog can spoil the experience... hint... it's dogs like Benton. And please get a GSD knowledgable trainer (who will almost certainly steer you away from the dog park) to work on better diversion and doggy introductions for Benton.", "YTA. I like dogs, I was raised with dogs, and something has happened to American dog owners in the past 20 years.

Of course YTA, under no exceptions you should have a reactive dog unleashed at a public park even with the vest. What if a kid has come there and your dog has bitten them? Or a smaller dog?\n\nYTA and an irresponsible dog owner. You shouldn\u2019t have pets.", "YTA\n\nDon't bring your aggressive dog to a dog park. Pretty much common sense there.", "YTA I\u2019m afraid, though you seem like a nice person. I don\u2019t take my greyhound to the dog park because of reactive dogs. At lot can happen between dogs in 3 minutes. My dog was attacked by a pitbull a couple of years ago, and the whole thing took a few seconds. She had to have surgery for her wounds, and I can\u2019t face taking the risk now. It sounds like you are doing things the right way for the most part, and better than many reactive-dog owners.", "YTA. This is outrageously dangerous behavior.  You\u2019re putting your dog and every other dog there at risk.  And you\u2019re opening yourself up to huge liability if something goes sideways.  Stay away from the dog park for everyone\u2019s well-being.  This nonsense is why we can\u2019t have nice things.", "Huge YTA . Every dog park explicitly says no aggressive dogs. It can go wrong 100x ways. There can be language barriers, all sorts of things. Just don\u2019t do it.", "You had good intentions but YTA. Fellow owner of a dog-reactive dog here. Your job is to eliminate the possibility of injury whenever possible. Voluntarily entering a space that is open for dogs to be unleashed is not eliminating possibility of injury. Yes, it was empty. Yes, you were keeping an eye out. Yes, you warned the other owner and asked her to give you space to leave the area. But you shouldn\u2019t have been there in the first place. \n\nYour dog deserves exercise and to run as much as any other dog. But it\u2019s YOUR job to find a way to do that safely. Buy a 20 ft leash and find an empty field. Ask a local church if you can use the empty grassy area most of them has to play with your dog. A neighbor with a fenced yard? Post in a local neighborhood FB page and ask if anyone knows of an open space. We\u2019ve lived in 5 states, 7 apartment complexes, and always found a way to exercise our reactive dog. Worst comes to worst? You hop on a bike, put on the harness, and get going. \n\nThe lady shouldn\u2019t have been so rude. But you could\u2019ve avoided the situation altogether.", "YTA- Bring a reactive dog into a place where other dogs will be playing and walking freely is dangerous. People expect to just walk in and unleash their dogs. It\u2019s fine if you take I\u2019m to the pens where only he will be but your putting your dog and others in danger. What if you didn\u2019t notice the lady and she just let her dog in to play. Your dog or hers could of gotten hurt even worse if she was to call the cops or animal control yours could of been put down.", "It's a bit ESH to be honest.\n\nEven though the area was empty, you shouldn't have unleashed him knowing his temperament. What if you hadn't noticed someone quietly coming in? What if that woman had had headphones on and not heard you to wait? That's a big risk you took, both with your own dog and with the lives/health of other dogs and dog owners. If the individual zones are busy, keep him leashed and wait until one is free.\n\nThat said, you were resolving the issue by warning her before any harm was done and getting the dog as quickly as possible to get out of her way. Yes, she'd be right to be irritated you created that situation in the first place, but that's not reason to get shirty and name-call, especially *after* it's resolved. Uncalled for aggression, even in the face of justified annoyance, is not OK.", "NTA. People can chill for a minute. I take my dog to the dog park. If someone asked me to wait so they can leash up to leave, I have no problem doing so. A little consideration for others goes a long way. And if someone is a dog lover then they would want this older dog to at least get a bit of time to run around off leash. I could understand being irritated with having to wait since we're all so set on immediate gratification.  So I would have said N.A.H but then the woman called OP a bitch and that makes her the AH.", "ESH. People with aggressive or reactive dogs should not be bringing them to the dog park. I know it\u2019s a bummer, but almost any dog is fast and strong and can do serious injury to someone else\u2019s dog. A big dog even more so. This time you were able to get your dog before someone else came in, but it would be very easy to miss a person coming in or for them to come in anyway. \n\nBut, you had it under control, and all this lady had to do was wait like two minutes or less. Take a frigging breath lady! No need to be an asshole.", "YTA I love dogs, and I've owned them my whole life but I gotta say that modern dog owners not unlike modern parents have become really entitled over the past few decades.  None of us should have to explain why bringing a reactive dog to a dog park is a bad idea", "YTA. Next time please wait for an individual pen to open up. There are so many things that could go wrong with you having an *unleashed reactive* dog no matter how many precautions you think you are taking.", "YTA\n\nSome dogs are not suitable for, and will never be a dog park kind of dog. Based on your statement, your dog falls into that category. You should steer clear of public dog parks to avoid liability issues. That would keep your dog and other dogs safe. \n\nNo one wants their dog to be attacked and injured by your dog, and your dog shouldn't be put at risk of having to be put down due to an irresponsible owner.\n\nIf you need to tire out your dog, I suggest a good game of tug or obedience for mental stimulation. Working on advanced obedience can be a lot of fun for you and be super fulfilling for your dog.", "YTA..\n\nYour dog never should have been off leash in a public dog park, you know this.

What happens?\n\nPeople who have hearing issues have a right to use the park. People who don\u2019t speak fluent English have a right to use the park. Aggressive dogs do not.

You helped me last time so I\u2019m back again.\n\nI (mid 20\u2019s F) lost my best friend a little over a year ago. Since then, I adopted a senior dog from the shelter named Benton. He\u2019s a almost 9yo German Shepard. He was an owner surrender and is dog reactive.\n\nAnyways, this happened yesterday morning. The town I live in has a pretty nice dog park.

However, yesterday the two individual pens were occupied but the big yard was open. Benton wears a harness with \u2018REACTIVE\u2019 clearly visible. \n\nSince the large pen was empty, I unleashed him and started throwing his ball for him to chase. I would say about 20 minutes later a woman 20-30s was bringing her dog to the entrance of the pen where I was sitting. \n\nAt that point, I let her know that my dog was reactive and asked if she would wait a couple minutes so I could get him leashed up and out the other gate.

THEY WILL FAIL AND IT WILL BE YOUR FAULT FOR SETTING THEM UP FOR FAILURE. If your dog fails, you may get a fine and expected to pay the vet bills, but your reactive dog could be ordered to be euthanized if the situation is bad enough or repeats often enough.

Can't you imagine how horrible it would feel to watch your dog hurt another? How heartbroken you'd be if your dog was euthanized as a dangerous animal?\n\nI had a reactive dog for 11 years. He was my baby and the light of my life, but we did not go to dog parks. He never ran off leash. It took years of training and socialization before he could stop wearing a muzzle at the vet. It was HARD. it was draining. But it had to be done.\n\nReactive dogs deserve to be kept safe from their own actions. It's our responsibility to keep them safe from themselves.", "YTA. You should NOT be putting your dog in a position where they will make a terrible mistake. Please work on training your dog - you, your dog, and society will be better for it.\n\nIn the mean time, I take my reactive dog to SniffSpots. They are private backyards that you rent out.

Owning a reactive dog means you don't have the same freedom of owning a non reactive dog. As in you don't get to take your dog to dog parks and put everyone there at risk. I get you are being careful but that doesn't mean that accidents can't  happen. And of it does you are 100% liable, and be responsible for the dog being put down because you put it in a situation it would react. And someone WILL sue you. If you don't have a big enough yard for him to run around and can't find another way to exercise him then you seem to be out of options. If you aren't the right fit for the dog maybe someone else can be and maybe down the road after proper research you can find a non reactive dog to be your companion.", "I get you. It\u2019s not as regulated in the U.K. and we love living where we do because we have a chance to let our relative d*#^khead to exercise on the beach when it\u2019s quiet.", "What is a reactive dog?  When my dog is on a leash, I don\u2019t let physically close to other dogs.  When she is off the leash, she loves to play with other dogs.  As for people, she will absolutely do anything to get attention from a human!  She is funny.  She is really well behaved.  I know some people don\u2019t dogs and some people are scared of dogs.  She never approaches a human until I get the person\u2019s ok.  some dogs are not ok for others to play with.  Is this what you mean.  You let her know you just needed a few moments to leash your pup.  She walked away upset?  Ummm\u2026 her problem not yours.", "Dog parks in general are a bad idea, they\u2019re a breeding ground for diseases and dog fights. People say they\u2019re good for socialization, but if all owners are bringing their i socialized dogs to the park, none of them are going to know how to properly interact with each other. Adding in a reactive dog just increases the risk. There are many other ways to keep your pup active and socialized that will keep you both safe. As for judgement, I will say NAH, because there was no one at the park when you got there, and packed up to leave when people arrived.", "YTA - and even more so for clearly trying to justify your actions when you are in the wrong. YOU were endangering others. End of story. \n\nYou aren\u2019t accounting for the what-if situations that could happen. You and the other people in the park aren\u2019t infallible. You are assuming you have control in a space where there are many factors you do not have control over. What if an owner approaching a seemingly safe space for their dog already had their dog off leash? What if they couldn\u2019t hear your warning? What if they spoke a different language? You are making a lot of assumptions of control that would have TRAGIC consequences if things went differently than you assumed.", "I completely understand that. I took maybe 3 minutes to get my stuff and Benton leashed, but yes I get that people want to walk right in. At this dog park they label the smaller pens for individual/same household.", "also, dogs are FAST. What was Ops plan if her dog just went running after the other dog?", "I wasn\u2019t surprised. I understand that having a reactive dog is dangerous. I was watching out for people approaching and left immediately after.", "I disagree. If they brought the dog into the area when there were other dogs there I would agree but as they checked first and picked an empty area they are fine. They immediately went to leave when someone else showed up to prevent any issues and allow them use as they should. The person arriving overreacted and acted the ass.

The benches are within the first entrance so no. You couldn\u2019t get past me without walking right next to me. \n\nI\u2019m not familiar with that breed but he does fine with smaller dogs.

Pretty genius idea though.", "So for Benton, he\u2019s absolutely adores people and children. He however does not like when dogs (especially his height) get in his face. He\u2019s pretty good walking by them if the other dog is uninterested too.", "I know people are jumping on you a lot, but sincerely, wouldn't you have felt safer waiting for a private pen? Those family pens sound acceptable in your situation and it has the benefit of your dog seeing other dogs and feeling safe. You can stand by gate and hope someone doesn't have their earphones in while you try to warn them off, but what about when picking up poo or other distractions? Some dog owners are deaf, you can't perfectly control that situation. I'm just saying that if you're dog attacks another dog, he may be put down and another dog would be dead or injured or emotionally damaged.

Since the shelter knew your dog was reactive, your dog already has a known history. A dog with a known history is much more likely to be put down after an attack than a dog without one. \n\nYou cannot let a reactive dog loose in a public area even if they allow off leash and expect other people to cater to you. You have the reactive dog and you not other people need to be responsible. \n\nYour refusal to be responsible can cost your dog his life.

A dog park by definition is an uncontrolled public environment, so it's unreasonable to expect all dogs will \"not be interested in him,\" that's literally the point of the dog park for many owners/dogs.\n\nI know you're going off hours but the moment Benton is in the park, you make it PRIVATE space. That isn't fair. If I rolled up, saw a dog with a \"reactive\" vest on, I'd turn the heck around and go home. \n\nI sympathize with the plight of not having any other way to have off-leash freedom, but next time wait for a private pen and go at hours when that option is available to you.

You went early, went in the empty area, and vacated when someone else was coming in. It\u2019s ridiculous that someone couldn\u2019t wait two minutes while you left and gave you an attitude about it. I\u2019ve been at the dog park at midnight and if someone else comes we\u2019ll leave. It\u2019s usually another reactive dog and the person has the same thing in mind.

I thought I was going to watch my Lola have her throat ripped out. \n\nThankfully, they are all ok. Because the people involved knew how to separate dogs, and that is the only reason. \n\n\n*ARE YOU SERIOUSLY CAPABLE OF DEALING WITH THIS?*\n\nIf YOU make such an ignorant decision with the safety of your dog and all those around you, then I don't think you are ready for a dog like this. \n\nIf your dog hurts a person or another dog, he will probably be put down. *AND THAT WOULD BE YOUR FAULT, NOT HIS OR THE OTHER PERSON.*", "NTA. ur dog is marked and im going to assume that u do not take ur dog n2 an occupied ring. if u take ur dog to the park to take advantage of the run area and pull him out when another dog arrives, then i see nothing wrong. ur being a responsible owner. Edit- i want to add that it would be n ur best interest to muzzle him while at the park for added protection", "NTA.  It is a dog park for all dogs.  You handled the situation properly.  The other person was out of line.  Don\u2019t let her attitude affect yours.  You said your dog was playing with you.  The other dogs nearby did not set off your dog.  Keep being a responsible dog parent.", "NTA. Ideally she would have waited for you to get your dog out. My dog is leash reactive but not reactive and open unleashed areas. I highly suggest getting a trainer to work on that with your dog.", "YTA\n\nIf your dog is reactive, you do not bring your reactive dog to public off-leash activities. Protect your dog before a tragedy you could take measures to prevent happens. Others love their dogs just as much.

I don\u2019t know if I have to tell you this, but there\u2019s a lot of people that have PTSD from reactive German shepherds. They\u2019ve been used for as weapons for years.", "Yta- why would you bring a reactive dog to a dog park at all?", "YTA.  Reactive dogs have no business off leash in public spaces.  PERIOD.  NO EXCEPTIONS.  Dog parks are exclusively for well socialized and friendly dogs, even when empty.  People like you are why I\u2019d never take my friendly dogs to a dog park. You come across as selfish and entitled.  I hope when your dog attacks another dog, because it will due to you being a selfish AH, that the owner of the dog sues the shit out of you.  And muzzle your dog.", "Yes.", "Yta. You don't unleash a reactive dog because accidents happen and your job is to control your dog, something you can't do if it's off leash.", "YTA. \n\nLook I have a reactive dog. She's 14, and a miniature dachshund. She's way less reactive at 14, mainly because she sleeps about twenty hours a day. She was rushed by a group of dogs at a young age and would bite anyone who sniffed her too long. Shed love to go and run in a dog park, but she has never been in one her entire life because it's not worth her biting someone or biting to lay a boundary and then getting killed by another dog. It was bad enough for awhile walking her on a leash and people letting their dogs come up to her, despite me saying she is not friendly. She won't go after any dog, but she doesn't want anything to do with anyone not in her family and is very particular about her personal space.\n\nTHIS IS THE PRICE YOU PAY TO KEEP YOUR DOG, YOURSELF, AND OTHERS SAFE. IF YOU CANT HAVE THE SPACE 100% TO YOURSELF AND PREVENT OTHERS FROM COMING IN, YOU DONT UNLEASH YOUR DOG.", "You unleashed a reactive dog. It kinda doesn\u2019t matter that it was a dog park, and that it was wearing a vest. What you\u2019re doing is saying that the risk to other (leashed) dogs is worth it. YTA", "Soft YTA. I understand you wanting to get your dog out but this is not a safe option for him or any other dog he may encounter. \n\nI have a reactive dog myself and I don\u2019t bring her to dog parks because they are not fun for her. Reactive dogs react for a reason, and it is usually a trauma response. I\u2019m not sure what all you know about fight or flight, but once your dog switches to that mode it\u2019s pretty hard to break them out of it. \n\nI would hate for you to have a bad experience that ends in something traumatic for you both. \n\nUnfortunately we have to do things a bit differently with our babies who are reactive. I tend to avoid pet stores, busy walking trails & dog parks. Or if I do bring her to one of those places I ensure lots of distractions with treats and positive reinforcement of non-reactive behavior. I also do not reccomend anything off-leash so you can always ensure you have full control. (Fetch with an extra long lead could be an option) \n\nI also highly reccomend brain puzzles and mental stimulation for your German since they are so smart! Something simple like freezing some kibble in a wet towel or hiding treats around the house that he has to hunt for can he just as tiring as playing fetch!", "Light YTA here. Your dog is reactive and big. A GSD can clear a fence unless the boards or links are high, especially if it\u2019s reactive. I acknowledge and appreciate that you called out and went to the option safest for your dog, but with large reactive dogs, sorta isn\u2019t enough. That could cost you or someone else their dog, potentially both of you. I have one reactive dog, and one non-reactive dog. One gets to go off leash, the other does not. It\u2019s that simple. Even when I think the coast may be clear, it\u2019s not worth the risk. \n\nTry SniffSpot as an option, you can (cheaply) rent a fenced back yard entirely for you and your pup. It\u2019s not everywhere, but reach out to dog trainers and see if they know anyone that does that or would be willing to as well if SniffSpot isn\u2019t an option! Good luck to you and pup.", "What if next time the person entering is deaf or hard of hearing or they\u2019re wearing headphones and don\u2019t hear your warning? There would be a reasonable (albeit clearly na\u00efve as seen in your post) assumption that dogs in a group dog park would not be dog reactive and they could just walk in. That could end very badly. Your own dog could be put down completely unnecessarily at your own hands. \n\nAnd before you bring up the harness, that\u2019s not even sufficient enough for walks which is why you as a handler/owner (I would hope) guide your dog away from other dogs so it\u2019s definitely not sufficient warning for an off leash dog park.\n\nEither wait for a single pen to be open or come back a bit later.

YTA", "ESH\n\nI was on the fence. I think you handled the situation appropriately because you left as soon as somebody else came up. \n\n However, it's irresponsible to bring a reactive dog to a dog park because there are unexpected scenarios that could leave a dog injured.

She could have expressed to you why it was inappropriate for the dog to be there other than just grumbling about it and then calling you the b word.", "I have seen dogs die from similar situations. You have a large aggressive dog. I understand that his reactivity isn't your fault.  But, yta. All it takes is a few seconds. The problem isn't taking him to the dog park. It is that you put him in a communal pen. Leash walk him if a private area is not available. Looking into some trainers to help you work on that problem wouldn't be a bad idea either.", "Going against the grain. NTA. Reactive dogs still deserve a chance to roam and be exercised. I would have appreciated your approach and waited for you to leash the dog before entering. People just leave no room for nuance at all anymore. You entered an empty park and offered to leave immediately. Like they\u2019re reactive but they\u2019re still dogs with needs and personalities and they deserve that too. There aren\u2019t many options for dogs in that situation. You don\u2019t have a yard? Oh well. Shouldn\u2019t take them to an empty dog park. Shame on you.

If there were no other dogs there and you were sitting by the only entrance so you could let people know, I\u2019d say NTA. \n\nIn the future to protect yourself and your dog, I highly recommend just getting a cheap 50 ft lead. That way your dog can be free and chase his ball all he wants and you have a really easy way to recall him and leave quickly :)", "No. You tried to leave. Anyone saying YTA is an absolute moron to the nth degree. I will die on that hill. People can\u2019t wait a couple of minutes for you to leash the dog? You guys are stupid af.", "I\u2019m sorry, OP but I do think that YTA in this instance.\n\nYes, it\u2019s a designated area to exercise a dog. \nYes, it was a time you knew to be typically low attendance. \nYes, the common area was completely empty when you unleashed your dog.\nYes, it\u2019s a public space you have every right to use. \n\nBut it\u2019s still a common area that was designed with less sensitive dogs in mind. There\u2019s the expectation that other dogs will show up. Your dog\u2019s history still holds that he is sensitive and reactive to other dogs making it unsafe for him and other dogs for you to unleash him like that. It was a huge risk for him and others.

Wanting to lunge at others. He took that dog to the corner of the park away from the others, but once off leash, that dog ran like the speed of light to my dog. This was about 2-3 weeks ago. Thank goodness that dog didn\u2019t draw any blood. Ever since that experience, I don\u2019t want to go back to that dog park with my furchild.

Even having a collar that signifies your dog is reactive shows me you are not in denial about the reality of your dog.

Your dog is as capable of learning as the time and effort you are willing to put in to him. \n\nHaving adopted another reactive dog of a breed with a bad reputation (pit mix), until I know I can trust her completely I don't take her to a dog park unless she wears her muzzle (honestly even then I probably won't.) She gets overstimulated and becomes too prey driven and has to be snapped out of it (we have another dog who is bigger than her.) Even with the muzzle, I only take her to the private areas for family/individuals and don't take her into the public area even if it's empty. I'm not willing to risk having my dog put down because she's a breed with a bad reputation if my focus get's broken for one moment.\n\nJust a final thought, not sure how your local animal control views it but mine is harsher on people with known reactive dogs when there's an incident. I asked when I got my dog and asked why. I was told as an owner of a reactive dog it is my responsibility to protect others (other dogs) from my dog and the liability falls solely on my shoulders.

You can get lengths from 25 meters to 50 meters which allows plenty of breathing room for playing.", "If your dog is already reactive I don't advise trying him in an off leash area while he is on a lead.

Nor would I say that the woman who was waiting acted entitled for being told she couldn't go into the public dog park until OP got her dog under control and safely outside away from the park. The public play area should remain open to the public and for the couple minutes it likely took OP to evacuate the area it technically wasn't. Personally, I would be fine waiting, but there's also a lot of people who don't care about other pets, and actively don't give warnings about reactive (or even aggressive) pets. Luckily, OP wasn't one of them, but if the other lady has encountered such in the past it might explain why she felt the need to act in such a manner, even if it's not the best reaction.", "Not sure why you got downvoted. I laughed too.", "Then rent a private space. They exist. Or find a home that can care for a larce reactive dog, or take longer walks. Or take runs. Or hire a dog walker who can handle them and provide adequate stimulation.\n\nDon't endanger the public.", "the shelter told her tbf.", "OP did everything they could to ensure their pet would get enrichment and exercise in a way that was safe for their dog and others. I don't see any reasonable steps they could have done that they failed to. If you can't stand to wait a few moments before entering a public space then you're entitled and impatient. We share this earth with others, sometimes you are going to be mildly inconvenienced.", "OK so if they are occupied wait for when one isn't. Also leash walking outside of dog parks is a thing.", "No it\u2019s just a precaution because some people are idiots and just go to pet dogs without asking", "I have reactive dog and have considered a vest myself. He is 100% not aggressive. Aside from his reactivity his recall and other behaviours are well trained and he is currently undergoing training for his reactivity. I have many comments on how good he is. He just doesn't like other dogs in his face and unfortunately you cannot control what other owners do and how they train their dogs. As long as other dogs don't get directly in my dogs face he is fine. Comments like yours are so misguided and clearly uneducated.\n\nPeople let their dogs offleash all over the place even if it is not an offleash area. Vests are useful to warn these dumbass owners not to allow their friendly dog to approach, cos guess what. Not every dog wants to meet their friendly dog.", "It doesn't have to be. It might just be a smart responsible dog owner that is tired of the \"oh, my dog doesn't bite, he just wants to say hi!\"-ppl. I have a dachshund that is reactive on leash. No problem as long as he's on a leash and not in physical contact with other dogs. But every single walk when I'm at my moms I have to yell at ppl in the distance that they need to leash their dog and keep it away from us (it's illegal to not have your dog under control in general here and it's not really allowed to have them off leash in a lot of places but ppl doesn't know this or thinks it's for the OTHER dogs, not theirs) and they always respond with \"oh, but he doesn't bite!\". Well, no shit, Sherlock, that's what every biting dogs owner says at some point before they realise otherwise. Dachshunds have a rep for being aggressive here, I thought, so I'm amazed with how few ppl realise that I'm asking them to leash their dogs for THEIR safety. \n\nThat vest sounds really tempting, gotta say!", "As I understand it, it means a dog will \u201creact\u201d to certain stimulis that it shouldn\u2019t. Like barking non-stop at other dogs, people, cars, etc. Attacking the stimulus is considered a form of reactivity by some people.\n\n\n\nMany owners of aggressive dogs label their dogs \u201creactive\u201d which makes it harder for people to tell between the two.", "Sorry but if a dog has a giant \u201cREACTIVE DOG\u201d harness on, I\u2019m not letting my dog anywhere near it before I\u2019ve spoken to the owner, either. Neither did the other woman there, she spoke to OP first. As any responsible dog owner should do.", "People came in so OP immediately leashed their dog.", "I\u2019m not sure what your definition of public is but in the city, it\u2019s nearly impossible to NOT take your dog out in public for needed exercise/potty breaks unless you have a private yard ( which, depending on tons of different factors, can be a highly priced luxury). Not everyone has 34 acres for their reactive dogs to roam.", "Reactive and aggressive are not synonyms for each other. They\u2019re two different things.", "Yeah this. My dog got attacked at the dog park from a dog that was extremly agressive. He is severly injured just because someone thought it is a good idea to off leash her dog. People that don't realize that their dog can hurt others annoy me so much.", "We had a reactive dog growing up and she'd never hurt a human but got really protective/territorial towards other dogs only.", "Oh I'm glad no one got seriously hurt for you \ud83d\ude2d \n\nTBH I really am bewildered by people acting like this behavior is generally okay because everything was fine this time. I was in the same place as OP for a long time since my dog was very reactive for a lot of her life. Over and over I saw that you really don't have control over what other people do. \n\nMy pup has never hurt anyone but I learned from experience that a lot of people will not stop for you and it won't be malicious but simply how things are. Lots of other owners don't understand \"my dog is reactive/unfriendly so please hold on\" because they don't get the potential risk, or their attention is split and they didn't hear, or would have their dog off leash prior to me being able to do anything, or they simply thought their dog was super friendly and it'd be okay. And that's normal \u2014 you would probably assume that a dog in a communal space is there to be with other dogs and can be safely controlled and react based off that. \n\nIn the end, it's on the owner to meet their dog where they are and for a lot of owners with reactive dogs that means not putting them in the situation to begin with. We stopped taking her to the dog park as soon as we realized how tough it was for her for that reason. Not fair to other owners or to her to put her in a crappy and potentially dangerous situation.", "They might be able to cause more damage than a chihuahua, it doesn't mean the chihuahua isn't capable of hurting things.", "A chihuahua can still hurt things. Maybe not as seriously unless the things are small, but they can still hurt.", "That's the amount of damage, not the likelihood of any damage.", "Our neighbour\u2019s dog was fine with our dog. Until he wasn\u2019t and he killed my dog. As a result I always need to be 100% in control of my dogs and their environment. I do not walk them in the local off lead park because I do not trust other dogs. Or mine. Because they\u2019re fine. Until they\u2019re not. I\u2019m not taking that risk."]}
