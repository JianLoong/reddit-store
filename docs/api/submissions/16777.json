An 11 year old girl and a 10 year old boy. Their father and my sister were married, unhappily, before he died. Both were amazing parents who loved their kids. They did not work as a couple. Both were so young when they started dating and then she got pregnant and they fought to try and make a family work for the kids but it only made them hate each other over time. Then he died and my niblings were heartbroken. At 5 and 6 they were young but he was one of their two favorite people.\n\nMy sister has remarried since, about a year ago and she recently learned she was pregnant. She had this big photo perfect announcement planned with her, her husband and the kids, to show their excitement for the new baby arriving and the growing of their blended family. Except my niblings are not excited and this was not a happy thing for them. They told my sister they didn't want to be part of her announcement and when she asked why, they said they kind of hate that she is pregnant with someone else's baby and they don't want to be a blended family. She was heartbroken. She questioned them on why and they said her husband is just her husband and not their dad and this baby \"isn't dad's\" and how they wouldn't have chosen for a baby to come along.\n\nIt's been weeks now and my sister is mourning the announcement she planned and I think she is holding onto some negative feelings toward the kids. I think she dropped the ball a lot on this because clearly she never asked her kids how they felt about her husband or about the changes that had come into their lives. She just assumed they were happy and now her bubble has burst.\n\nThe kids told me the other day she was different with them now and they wondered if they could live with me because they think their mom just wants her new family now and not them if they don't want the new family. This is when I knew I needed to speak to my sister. She told me how much of a shock it was for her kids to say they weren't excited and didn't want the family they have. She also told me how much it broke her heart that they didn't do the announcement for her and now she won't be able to show the baby this exciting, loving announcement they get older, won't be able to show how the whole family was excited for their arrival. I told her she needs to let go of the fact she won't get her announcement as she wanted it. That she has two kids who need her and she needs to help them through this because they think everyone would be better off if they lived with me and that is not good for them to feel that way. She told me I was being unfair to her and piling on about something she's upset about. I told her she always told me being mom came first, her kids needs came first and that meant sometimes adults had to deal with their own shit quickly. I told her that was what her kids needed right now.\n\nShe still told me I came down too hard but I think it sort of worked. She is still not happy with me though.

Better now than in 10 years when she can't repair their relationship.", "Suggest family therapy to her", "NTA\n\nI can\u2019t imagine how oblivious (or detached) someone must be to be planning a pregnancy announcement and still not know how her own children feel.  Its not like they\u2019re that young, either- both are more than old enough to voice their opinions.\n\nThe kids\u2019 reactions and their mother\u2019s \u201cshock\u201d are enough evidence to me that sh has, indeed, been the AH.  Maybe it was just a massive, gross oversight, and she was so blinded by the new marriage abd pregnancy that she forgot she already has older kids that have their own thoughts and opportunities.  Or she really is trying to just replace them with a new family, idk.\n\nEither way, she dropped the ball hard and your comments either served as a wake-up call, or just calling her out.", "I hate, very very strongly hate, parents who force that perfect blended family fantasy onto their kids without actually getting to know and support what their kids want. \n\nYour sister has long needed to wake up to the fact that it\u2019s not about her or what fantasy she wants to happen. It\u2019s about what her kids need to feel happy, safe, and secure. She needs to get it together because she\u2019s been pretending to live in her own head and literally ignoring the needs of her kids.", "NTA. You said everything she needed to hear. She needs to prioritize her daughters\u2019 needs. \n\nCheck in with the kids regularly. Let them know they\u2019ll always have a place in your home. I hope your sister steps up and gets both her and them the help they all need.", "NTA - Your sister sounds like she has main character syndrome and needed a reality check. She a) assumed that everyone felt the same way as she did about everything, and b) gave her OWN CHILDREN the cold shoulder for having their own emotions that are different than hers, which only validated their concerns that their mom was moving on with her \u201cnew family.\u201d\n\nYour sister is prioritizing her own personal feelings and need for things to be exactly the way she wants them over the emotional well-being of her kids.", "NTA. Your sister is completely clueless about how children in blended families are absolutely terrified. She needs to be reassuring to those children rather than showing too much excitement for the new baby.", "Good on you.  The truth hurts.  A while hell of a lot when you realize you aren't protecting your kids from harm. You're actually causing it.  \n\n\nNTA. honestly, I'm hella glad they have you to talk some sense into your sister", "Honestly I don\u2019t think your sister is really stuck on this photo and announcement. It was the event that clued her into how her kids really feel about the family dynamics. They all need therapy. Desire for a blended family or not isn\u2019t really the kid\u2019s choice. They don\u2019t have another parent. I also think they are too young to be in control of who is parenting and where they are living. Yes they deserve to voice their opinions and desires, but it doesn\u2019t mean they are going to get exactly that. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is the ah here. It sounds like it is a rough situation that everyone is trying to deal with well meaning intentions. Again, a therapist who specializes in family will be a huge help, if nothing more than a third party who is impartial and helping everyone understand what everyone is thinking, etc.", "When her kids came to talk to you. What did you say to them?", "NAH - the announcement is part of a bigger picture for your sister, as evidenced by the fact that her children have openly expressed that they aren't happy with the situation and that they'd rather live with you. I understand change is hard for children, but unless there is abuse going on in the new household then it's an extreme reaction. Your sister is likely hurting from the situation as a whole.\n\nHowever, the pregnancy announcement is the least of her worries at this stage and you weren't wrong to point it out. \n\nDid her children ever get grief counselling?", "NTA, you only raised a concern to your sister based on what the kid asked you about. Your sister might be finally happy with the new guy and she thought everyone was happy the way she was. It appears that she didn't ask the kids who seems to be getting distant from her and she is trying to figure out why the kids can't be happy for her and welcome the new arrival. The kids feel that with the new baby they may lose their mom and will be getting much less attention, which appears to be the case with the way your sister is acting. So the kids are only going to want nothing to do with the baby and in a few years find their own life. Things like baby sitting or family time would be shunned and the baby will grow up as a single child without much connection with his/ her siblings. Maybe if your sister talked to the kids and worked something out, it could have a much happier ending.", "NTA. As much as it isn't what she wanted to hear, she needed to hear it. Is it possible the kids can stay with you for a time until things calm down? They need someone right now and it doesn't seem like your sister is willing too at this time.", "I don\u2019t think your sister is unhappy about her spoiled announcement as you make it look like. I think your sister is hart broken her new baby isn\u2019t welcome. She is probably divided on the love for her living children and the one for this new baby arriving.\nThat said news flash, new siblings are a hit or a miss with pre existing kids. Blended or not blended. My oldest daughter asked to had her baby sister retuned at the hospital first few days she was home. And the history repeated itself with my last baby (this time oldest ecstatic and youngest one in denial). And now are all inseparable. They make big announcements they are living every time shit doesn\u2019t fly their way to go live with\u2026 best friends, neighbor, relative, alone, \u2018 I don\u2019t know just far from here!\u2019 \nI am not making fun of their feeling but just pointing out 99% are grossly exaggerated. They are still children at the end. \nSo NAH cause you may have pointed out something she was unwilling to see, and to pay special attention to existing children while pregnant is tiring but a MUST. She should carve dedicated day for each of them.\nbut yes you have been harsh to her, at the end she is also entitle to her happiness and sibling rivalry has existed since biblical times. So you could also have talk to your nephews and put some shine on this new baby.", "I like how they didn\u2019t work as a couple but managed to continue to have sex and have 2 kids. \n\nNTA. She needed that cold bucket of water to the face. She seems rather selfish. \u201cI didn\u2019t get to do the announcement I wanted and the kids are unhappy with me but I\u2019m also unhappy which is more important\u201d", "NTA. Your niblings told you, they are worried their mum wants to replace them with her new baby/family. That should be a wake up call for your sister. It was just an announcement, her children need her. Reading this just broke my heart for these kids.", "NTA she needed a reality check. Let\u2019s face it, she isn\u2019t upset for the new baby not getting a video to watch, she\u2019s mad she didn\u2019t get her social media moment.", "I think your sister is a self centered asshole and delusional to boot. You are telling her that her kids want to stop living with her and she is replying you're being mean wahhh. I'd be really disappointed in her. Hopefully she shapes up but I doubt it. NTA. You tried.", "NTA thank you for standing up for your niblings", "NTA\n\nYou were right and she knows it. She'll get over it", "NTA - She better start putting those kids in therapy and she needs to go as well !", "She isn't trying to help her children in their pain and stress and feeling abandoned? (Lots of kids feel a new baby is replacing them. Its not like kids always use logic, after all.)\n\nNTA \n\nI'm old enough to remember when birth announcement post cards were unheard of and so I doubt any of us born way back then feel we missed anything?\n\nHer kids coming first isn't supposed to be lip service - just behavior,", "NTA. You said what needed to be said. Her own children asked if they could live with you instead of her due to how she was handling this situation.\n\nIf that's not a huge eye opener for her, I don't know what would be.", "if your sister is more concerned with not having her picture perfect announcement than her kids actually reaching out to family members to ask if they could go live with them, she has some serious issues\n\nNTA and your sister really needs a wake up call", "NTA she's being a shit mother to her existing kids at the moment putting her selfish want for a stupid announcement to post on social media (that's really what it's about let's be honest) above their wellbeing and I can absolutely see why they feel like she's going to abandon them for her \"new family\"\n\nFamily therapy is a must imo also she needs to apologise to her kids for making them feel like she's going to abandon them or replace them with this new baby", "NTA. There is a trend for these remarried parents on Reddit. Just because they found love and happiness in a new person doesnt mean their children would feel the same way too.

She\u2019s more worried about how this future baby years from now might (never in reality) look at the pregnancy announcement and wonder at her half siblings not being in it, than about how her existing kids are explaining how they feel NOW.\n\nyeah,that\u2019s a big problem.   \n\nIs she a social media hound?is she more worried about visual optics of her perfect family and feels like her children are \u2018ruining this\u2019? \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly normal to have mom alone or with dad in a pregnancy announcing picture.  \n\nShe\u2019s way overthinking this, and not in a good way.  She needs to care about the children she\u2019s got now.", "NTA at this point the announcement should be the least of her worries. She should really focus in getting her children in a better place mentally before the baby gets here. She should focus on making sure that baby has a happy family going forward instead of a picture to look back on.", "NTA and I hope she keeps listening to you. She\u2019s got some work to put in to be a good parent right note. It centers around the kids she already has and it\u2019s not going to be glamorous and cute.", "NTA, she apparently said it herself kids come first.", "Agree NTA. Those kids need to see they\u2019re still a priority for her. She\u2019s too busy focused on Instagram family life and not the real hard work involved.", "I'll try but I don't know that it will go over well, me saying/suggesting more when she's upset with me still.", "I don't think she's trying to replace them. I think she did get wrapped up in the whirlwind of her new marriage and I think she saw the baby as a tie that wraps them all together perfectly now and she didn't stop to ask if her kids WANTED to be wrapped together forever.", "They are still children and I agree with that. But normally when the dramatic stuff flares up, you would expect them to say they are leaving to the parent(s) or just make a big announcement. The kids approached me and asked to come live with in private and they seemed very serious about it.\n\nI don't disagree that she's entitled to her happiness but clearly she didn't know her kids were unhappy and they don't see this baby as a good thing, or fully see the baby as a sibling. Just her baby with someone who is not their dad. That is stuff complicated and maybe they will always feel that way, maybe not, but clearly the kids need help.", "It happens. Especially when you are young and the sex is good, which is something my sister said once. But sex doesn't always mean you will make a good couple. Even having kids together doesn't mean you will work well as a couple.", "Nah keep at it. Fuck her feelings right now. Her kids feelings are more important and therapy is needed\n Just find a way to word it the right way. Follow up and ask her how she\u2019s doing with the bombshell.", "And the way the kids say she\u2019s treating them differently. They have these doubts and suspicions that are not being helped by her treatment. They just told her the truth and she made it about herself.", "Agreed, i dont think so either.  But from her kids' perspectives, i can see that being the obvious conclusion to them since they won't associate the new husband with the same kind of happiness as their mother, who wasn't on great terms with their deceased dad in the first place.  I think you gave her a much-needed wake-up call - from an adult and not just her children - that she can't really dismiss too easily.  Hopefully things can work out for them", "I imagine for the children it snot about what she's doing, but more about how they feel about what she seems to be doing? And  many kids feel jealous that things will change for them specifically. In these children's case they have lost a lot already. Some kids resist change. That's not unnatural either. Its about comfort level.", "Of course they need help I clearly stated she should dedicate special time for each of them. I just saying seems 1) you had quite the very unfavorable spin on your sister (the title of this is quite harth less and paint a narcissist instagram asshole, not a divided mother). \n2) you can also help the kids highlighting positive things about their step father and baby.\nLet\u2019s be real at least the baby is there to stay on the long run. What you want your sister to drop him off at fire station?\nPrepubescent children are not the most reasonable people on the planet. Some gentle coaxing is much needed.", "Oh I totally understand. My sister was in a relationship with a much older man (her 18 him 29). He was not attractive and was not mentally stable \u201cbut the sex was good\u201d. \n\nAnd I just mean that their relationship was on the rocks with the first kid and they managed to have another one. I don\u2019t mean to insinuate these children are mistakes because it sounds like their father loved them very much. I have to imagine they didn\u2019t plan the first and especially were not careful before being pregnant with the second\u2026 don\u2019t be silly wrap your Willy kids!", "Yes, exactly. I hope so too because they were genuinely very close before and I know my sister loves her kids and they love her.", "I don't expect my sister to drop the baby off anywhere. But her kids need to not feel like she's going to be forever angry at them and distant with them because they don't feel the way she wants them to. The fact she continues to bring up the announcement and how she didn't get the one she wanted is not going to help bring them closer together. I also don't think telling them mom's husband is great, baby will be great will help. I think therapy will be needed. I think they will need to talk about their loss and the fact they lost their dad and now mom is with someone else, happily. While they are still wishing for their dad. I would understand if my sister had focused more on how sad she is that the kids feel that way toward the baby. But she seemed more upset about the announcement and I am not the only person who thought this.", "Okay, gotcha. Yeah. They had the kids pretty close together so I think they learned after #2 but also... I think their relationship went really downhill after their son was born. But both were amazing parents. They loved their kids even when they hated each other and they always made sure their kids had a good life.\n\nI hate that the kids lost him. He was a great father to them.", "NTA. At this point, you need to advocate for your  'niblings'. You're right, they need therapy, preferably a children's grief counsellor. Your sister is selfish, but I do wonder if she's suffering from the toxicity of her previous relationship with their father and his death? People behave out-of-character when traumatised. If she has always been like this, then her upset at not getting the perfect announcement is shallow and those kids are gonna need your support.", "So did you suggest therapy? I m not say at all you the AH here. Nor is your sister. Just need professional and not involved perspective. They probably don\u2019t hate their step father but just see as new baby get the happy mommy daddy, they grow up with mom and dad hating each other and now their father is also dead. Therapy should have entered the door a long time ago.", "It's not an advice sub or one for you to backseat drive someone else's life. OP asked for judgement, not nagging or did yous or should'ves."]}
