{"id": 16777, "submission_id": "13chw26", "title": "AITA for telling my sister she needs to let go of the fact she didn't get her picture perfect pregnancy announcement and help her kids?", "selftext": "My sister has two kids. An 11 year old girl and a 10 year old boy. Their father and my sister were married, unhappily, before he died. Both were amazing parents who loved their kids. They did not work as a couple. Both were so young when they started dating and then she got pregnant and they fought to try and make a family work for the kids but it only made them hate each other over time. Then he died and my niblings were heartbroken. At 5 and 6 they were young but he was one of their two favorite people.\n\nMy sister has remarried since, about a year ago and she recently learned she was pregnant. She had this big photo perfect announcement planned with her, her husband and the kids, to show their excitement for the new baby arriving and the growing of their blended family. Except my niblings are not excited and this was not a happy thing for them. They told my sister they didn't want to be part of her announcement and when she asked why, they said they kind of hate that she is pregnant with someone else's baby and they don't want to be a blended family. She was heartbroken. She questioned them on why and they said her husband is just her husband and not their dad and this baby \"isn't dad's\" and how they wouldn't have chosen for a baby to come along.\n\nIt's been weeks now and my sister is mourning the announcement she planned and I think she is holding onto some negative feelings toward the kids. I think she dropped the ball a lot on this because clearly she never asked her kids how they felt about her husband or about the changes that had come into their lives. She just assumed they were happy and now her bubble has burst.\n\nThe kids told me the other day she was different with them now and they wondered if they could live with me because they think their mom just wants her new family now and not them if they don't want the new family. This is when I knew I needed to speak to my sister. She told me how much of a shock it was for her kids to say they weren't excited and didn't want the family they have. She also told me how much it broke her heart that they didn't do the announcement for her and now she won't be able to show the baby this exciting, loving announcement they get older, won't be able to show how the whole family was excited for their arrival. I told her she needs to let go of the fact she won't get her announcement as she wanted it. That she has two kids who need her and she needs to help them through this because they think everyone would be better off if they lived with me and that is not good for them to feel that way. She told me I was being unfair to her and piling on about something she's upset about. I told her she always told me being mom came first, her kids needs came first and that meant sometimes adults had to deal with their own shit quickly. I told her that was what her kids needed right now.\n\nShe still told me I came down too hard but I think it sort of worked. She is still not happy with me though.

Its not like they\u2019re that young, either- both are more than old enough to voice their opinions.\n\nThe kids\u2019 reactions and their mother\u2019s \u201cshock\u201d are enough evidence to me that sh has, indeed, been the AH.  Maybe it was just a massive, gross oversight, and she was so blinded by the new marriage abd pregnancy that she forgot she already has older kids that have their own thoughts and opportunities.  Or she really is trying to just replace them with a new family, idk.\n\nEither way, she dropped the ball hard and your comments either served as a wake-up call, or just calling her out.", "I hate, very very strongly hate, parents who force that perfect blended family fantasy onto their kids without actually getting to know and support what their kids want. \n\nYour sister has long needed to wake up to the fact that it\u2019s not about her or what fantasy she wants to happen. It\u2019s about what her kids need to feel happy, safe, and secure. She needs to get it together because she\u2019s been pretending to live in her own head and literally ignoring the needs of her kids.", "NTA. You said everything she needed to hear. She needs to prioritize her daughters\u2019 needs. \n\nCheck in with the kids regularly. Let them know they\u2019ll always have a place in your home. I hope your sister steps up and gets both her and them the help they all need.", "NTA - Your sister sounds like she has main character syndrome and needed a reality check. She a) assumed that everyone felt the same way as she did about everything, and b) gave her OWN CHILDREN the cold shoulder for having their own emotions that are different than hers, which only validated their concerns that their mom was moving on with her \u201cnew family.\u201d\n\nYour sister is prioritizing her own personal feelings and need for things to be exactly the way she wants them over the emotional well-being of her kids.", "NTA. Your sister is completely clueless about how children in blended families are absolutely terrified. She needs to be reassuring to those children rather than showing too much excitement for the new baby.", "Good on you.  The truth hurts.  A while hell of a lot when you realize you aren't protecting your kids from harm. You're actually causing it.  \n\n\nNTA. honestly, I'm hella glad they have you to talk some sense into your sister", "Honestly I don\u2019t think your sister is really stuck on this photo and announcement. It was the event that clued her into how her kids really feel about the family dynamics. They all need therapy. Desire for a blended family or not isn\u2019t really the kid\u2019s choice. They don\u2019t have another parent. I also think they are too young to be in control of who is parenting and where they are living. Yes they deserve to voice their opinions and desires, but it doesn\u2019t mean they are going to get exactly that. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is the ah here. It sounds like it is a rough situation that everyone is trying to deal with well meaning intentions. Again, a therapist who specializes in family will be a huge help, if nothing more than a third party who is impartial and helping everyone understand what everyone is thinking, etc.", "When her kids came to talk to you. What did you say to them?", "NAH - the announcement is part of a bigger picture for your sister, as evidenced by the fact that her children have openly expressed that they aren't happy with the situation and that they'd rather live with you. I understand change is hard for children, but unless there is abuse going on in the new household then it's an extreme reaction. Your sister is likely hurting from the situation as a whole.\n\nHowever, the pregnancy announcement is the least of her worries at this stage and you weren't wrong to point it out. \n\nDid her children ever get grief counselling?", "NTA, you only raised a concern to your sister based on what the kid asked you about. Your sister might be finally happy with the new guy and she thought everyone was happy the way she was. It appears that she didn't ask the kids who seems to be getting distant from her and she is trying to figure out why the kids can't be happy for her and welcome the new arrival. The kids feel that with the new baby they may lose their mom and will be getting much less attention, which appears to be the case with the way your sister is acting. So the kids are only going to want nothing to do with the baby and in a few years find their own life. Things like baby sitting or family time would be shunned and the baby will grow up as a single child without much connection with his/ her siblings. Maybe if your sister talked to the kids and worked something out, it could have a much happier ending.", "NTA. As much as it isn't what she wanted to hear, she needed to hear it.

Your niblings told you, they are worried their mum wants to replace them with her new baby/family. That should be a wake up call for your sister. It was just an announcement, her children need her.

You are telling her that her kids want to stop living with her and she is replying you're being mean wahhh. I'd be really disappointed in her. Hopefully she shapes up but I doubt it. NTA. You tried.", "NTA thank you for standing up for your niblings", "NTA\n\nYou were right and she knows it.

She should focus on making sure that baby has a happy family going forward instead of a picture to look back on.", "NTA and I hope she keeps listening to you. She\u2019s got some work to put in to be a good parent right note. It centers around the kids she already has and it\u2019s not going to be glamorous and cute.", "NTA, she apparently said it herself kids come first.", "Agree NTA. Those kids need to see they\u2019re still a priority for her.

I think she did get wrapped up in the whirlwind of her new marriage and I think she saw the baby as a tie that wraps them all together perfectly now and she didn't stop to ask if her kids WANTED to be wrapped together forever.", "They are still children and I agree with that. But normally when the dramatic stuff flares up, you would expect them to say they are leaving to the parent(s) or just make a big announcement. The kids approached me and asked to come live with in private and they seemed very serious about it.\n\nI don't disagree that she's entitled to her happiness but clearly she didn't know her kids were unhappy and they don't see this baby as a good thing, or fully see the baby as a sibling. Just her baby with someone who is not their dad. That is stuff complicated and maybe they will always feel that way, maybe not, but clearly the kids need help.", "It happens. Especially when you are young and the sex is good, which is something my sister said once. But sex doesn't always mean you will make a good couple. Even having kids together doesn't mean you will work well as a couple.", "Nah keep at it. Fuck her feelings right now. Her kids feelings are more important and therapy is needed\n Just find a way to word it the right way. Follow up and ask her how she\u2019s doing with the bombshell.", "And the way the kids say she\u2019s treating them differently. They have these doubts and suspicions that are not being helped by her treatment. They just told her the truth and she made it about herself.", "Agreed, i dont think so either.  But from her kids' perspectives, i can see that being the obvious conclusion to them since they won't associate the new husband with the same kind of happiness as their mother, who wasn't on great terms with their deceased dad in the first place.  I think you gave her a much-needed wake-up call - from an adult and not just her children - that she can't really dismiss too easily.  Hopefully things can work out for them", "I imagine for the children it snot about what she's doing, but more about how they feel about what she seems to be doing? And  many kids feel jealous that things will change for them specifically. In these children's case they have lost a lot already. Some kids resist change. That's not unnatural either. Its about comfort level.", "[deleted]", "Oh I totally understand. My sister was in a relationship with a much older man (her 18 him 29). He was not attractive and was not mentally stable \u201cbut the sex was good\u201d. \n\nAnd I just mean that their relationship was on the rocks with the first kid and they managed to have another one. I don\u2019t mean to insinuate these children are mistakes because it sounds like their father loved them very much. I have to imagine they didn\u2019t plan the first and especially were not careful before being pregnant with the second\u2026 don\u2019t be silly wrap your Willy kids!", "Yes, exactly. I hope so too because they were genuinely very close before and I know my sister loves her kids and they love her.", "I don't expect my sister to drop the baby off anywhere. But her kids need to not feel like she's going to be forever angry at them and distant with them because they don't feel the way she wants them to. The fact she continues to bring up the announcement and how she didn't get the one she wanted is not going to help bring them closer together. I also don't think telling them mom's husband is great, baby will be great will help. I think therapy will be needed. I think they will need to talk about their loss and the fact they lost their dad and now mom is with someone else, happily. While they are still wishing for their dad. I would understand if my sister had focused more on how sad she is that the kids feel that way toward the baby. But she seemed more upset about the announcement and I am not the only person who thought this.", "Okay, gotcha. Yeah. They had the kids pretty close together so I think they learned after #2 but also... I think their relationship went really downhill after their son was born. But both were amazing parents. They loved their kids even when they hated each other and they always made sure their kids had a good life.\n\nI hate that the kids lost him. He was a great father to them.", "NTA. At this point, you need to advocate for your  'niblings'. You're right, they need therapy, preferably a children's grief counsellor. Your sister is selfish, but I do wonder if she's suffering from the toxicity of her previous relationship with their father and his death? People behave out-of-character when traumatised. If she has always been like this, then her upset at not getting the perfect announcement is shallow and those kids are gonna need your support.", "[deleted]", "It's not an advice sub or one for you to backseat drive someone else's life. OP asked for judgement, not nagging or did yous or should'ves.", "NAH. Your sister sounds like somebody who\u2019s been so unhappy for so long, and is now experiencing marital happiness - and hope - for the first time in a long time.\n\nShe finally has a marriage she wants, and a child being brought into what she thought was a healthy happy home \u2014 only to realize that her kids are unhappy. The reality she thought existed actually doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s hard for anyone.\n\nIf her kids could go back in time, they would clearly undo the marriage, and still have their dad around. But for your sister, all of that would preclude her new, happy marriage, and the tiny life she is carrying inside of her. That must sting *deeply* for both parties: there\u2019s no happy medium there.", "NAH \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like the kids\u2019 behavior suggested any issues before now. Should she have checked in? I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s something a little off to me about asking your kids how they feel about you having a baby before you start trying, but I agree a proactive conversation would be ideal. \n\nShe\u2019s grieving, they\u2019re grieving, she needed a direct talk and she got it.", "NAH. You did come down harsh but she did need to hear it. I mean you did paint her as this callous mother who doesn\u2019t care at all about her kids only the announcement. But it sounds like the first thing she brought up to you was her kids feelings and being concerned and then brought up the announcement. She\u2019s allowed to be concerned about her kids and also disappointed her expectations aren\u2019t a reality with the announcement.", "NAH. Your sister needs to discuss this with her children. Yes. But that they rejected their sibling she\u2019s pregnant with like that ALSO means your sister gets to have hurt feelings. Parenting isn\u2019t being completely devoid of emotions. It\u2019s likely the kids were happy and there wasn\u2019t anything for your sister to be overly concerned about until the pregnancy. It\u2019s a huge changing dynamic. Having new siblings when you\u2019re a decade older is difficult even in a nuclear family. The outlier child is more like an only child and the older children often end up in partial parenting roles. Your sister has a lot of work ahead to \u201cblend\u201d her family. She\u2019s also pregnant and hormonal. But it sounds like she\u2019s raised great kids who have good relationships with safe adults in their lives. That\u2019s the goal. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll figure it out. Right now being upset over the pregnancy announcement is probably a buffer to the rejection the baby just received from the siblings. My kids know that if they\u2019re uncomfortable coming to me, for whatever reason, Auntie is there for them. It truly takes a village.", "NTA It broke my heart how they said they wanted to live with you so mom can have her new family. Those poor kids. She needs to do family therapy asap. She should have already done it and she would have known how they were feeling.", "YTA, it's not bad to call your sister's attention but if you do it with no empathy and you certainly had some cruelty, you start by saying that your sister was trapped in an unhappy marriage, and as you said she was in a bubble of happiness, and now That it broke is sad, where is your concern for your sister? It's okay that you worry about your sister, but why call her a bad mother? your sister. How has your sister changed with your nephews? You yell at them, leave them without food, tell them that you hate them? I guess not because you don't mention it, she is sad and obviously doesn't have the energy to be the best mother in the world; Did you do anything to comfort her after her kids humiliated her (whether they're kids or not, that's what they did), or are you only there when it comes to shaming her?", ">She still told me I came down too hard but I think it sort of worked\n\nWelp, hard or not, hopefully it did work! Otherwise later she shouldn't be surprised when her kids move out at 18 and go NC", "Not the main point, but the idea of this child caring about their pregnancy announcement photos when they\u2019re older is bizarre to me. Maybe it\u2019s just because at 37 I\u2019m not from a generation who got announced in such a formal way, but is that a thing? I feel like my reaction would be somewhere between \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t want to actively think about my parents having unprotected sex.\u201d", "NTA. It seems to me like she cares more about appearance of a happy family and not so much the actual happiness of her family. The picture perfect announcement isn\u2019t going to mean shit 10 years from now if it\u2019s just a miserable memory for her two children. They shouldn\u2019t feel like they have to do this and be ok with the situation in order for their mom to be happy and love them. Was there a huge picture perfect family announcement when they were born? I\u2019m going to guess no. She\u2019s going to send the message that they weren\u2019t a \u201chappy family\u201d until new husband and new baby came along. Therapy waiting to happen for these kids.

I would maybe reach out an olive branch after things have calmed down for the sake of the relationship, but she needs to sit on your words for a short while imo. You say you think it worked, so see how she deals now and have another talk not to apologise but with the intention of clearing the air. You did the right thing, you advocated for those kids who sound like they aren't coping very well.", "NTA. Pregnancy announcements are a relatively new thing, and for her to be this hung up on it is a little odd. She should focus on healing the relationship with her kids rather than harping on a one-time photograph.", "NTA. If your sister wants a happy blended family, she will have to work for it, and the longer she doesn't do this, the harder it will be to get the outcome she wants.", "NTA Look, she's gonna be mad at you for a while but likely it's displaced feelings and she's actually mad at herself. You did the right thing. Just keep being there for your niblings and hopefully your sister will come around.", "NTA. You're looking out for your niece and nephew. Chances are if your sister focuses on them, maybe talks to them, takes them to therapy they could be happy, and be happy about a sibling (eventually).", "NTA you have done everything right in this situation", "Your not the AH but here is advice ,\n\n\nTake your sister to court if the kids want to live with you then the court will respect that decision since they are at the age where they are legally allowed to make their own choices", "NTA \n\nTreating her kids differently because they didn't follow the plot line she'd written in her head is not okay. They need support right now.", "This hits home for me because this was my worst fear for most of my childhood. One parent dies, the other gets remarried and starts a new family. I know that irl kids don\u2019t get a say in these matters, but as a kid your whole life is your family, and school. Your home life is extremely important and not having control over that is/was terrifying. \n\nI\u2019m going with NTA which makes your sister TA. She has two kids who are so unhappy they want to get out of the house. I\u2019m glad they have an aunt they can tell these things to. Good for you for speaking with your sister. I know I\u2019m projecting here but I think she is a huge asshole for putting her new husband and baby before her existing children. They lost their dad and they\u2019re losing their mom to this fantasy of hers that she\u2019s too wrapped up in to be attuned to the very valid feelings of her kids", "NTA. Hope your sister gets over this quickly as it is already harming her relationship with her kids.

It sounds like she skipped some steps because she was already ready to move on when her husband died; she needed counselling on how to approach her children\u2019s loss and it looks like she didn\u2019t get it. She doesn\u2019t seem to have considered that her children\u2019s viewpoints are so very different from hers on this.", "And?  The hole left by a loving parent can't be filled.  Not after 5 years, not after 50.  A new relationship with a parent-like figure can be established but it takes time and it doesn't work if its forced.  It took my step-siblings around 20 years to view my dad as something beyond their mom's partner and he very deliberately did *not* try to fill the father role for them in order to not push them away.", "Have an excavator come and dig a 20 ft hole in your lawn. \n\nDo nothing.\n\nLet me know how it looks in 5 years. \n\nHealing takes active work, not just time. A void is filled very slowly without work.", "You guys are making huge assumptions. Her partner DIED. She\u2019s a single mom who (luckily) found love again and she is trying to include her children in the welcoming of their new sibling\u2026", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to expect your sister to never remarry or have a blended family just because her ex husband and her kids father died. It\u2019s really sad for the kids, but it sounds like they may need some therapy to deal with everything in a healthy way.", "But she's shocked that they aren't on board meaning she hasn't had an actual conversation with them about any of this", "I absolutely agree therapy is needed. But I think grief therapy needs to play a huge part in this. The kids lost their dad and that is clearly still very tough for them.", "I think there's a copy of mine in my baby book? I've seen it once when my mom pulled out all three of our baby books and showed us. My main take away from that experience was the difference in effort my mom put into my sister's baby book (first child, lots of pictures, everything filled in detail for the first year), compared to mine (middle child, fewer pictures and half of them had my sister too, things were mostly filled in but in the same pen so it looked like she sat down and did it all at once when I was a year old), and my brother's (youngest child, she made an effort for the first six months or so but didn't even finish filling in the 'firsts').", "I was mostly trying to explain what I thought the other comment was talking about. But it does at least seem slightly true if we are taking into account what Op has said about them not having therapy, the blindsided reaction, etc. But this is what this sub is for. We only know so much  to for an opinion with", "She's not a mind reader. If the kids never told her, then how would she know?\n\nNew baby changes the game quite a bit and yeah it can be shocking how kids react to that kind of thing at times because they don't process things the way adults do.", "agree!!! if you go on many of the parenting and pregnancy subs it's filled with women contemplating having another in fear it wound negatively effect their current children. There are literally ones that are specifically for discussing if you should have another. We are stopping at one because we do not have the capacity to care for 2 100% but i know i can give everything i have to the baby that is already alive!!!"]}
