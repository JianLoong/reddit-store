{"id": 16777, "submission_id": "13chw26", "title": "AITA for telling my sister she needs to let go of the fact she didn't get her picture perfect pregnancy announcement and help her kids?", "selftext": "My sister has two kids. An 11 year old girl and a 10 year old boy. Their father and my sister were married, unhappily, before he died. Both were amazing parents who loved their kids. They did not work as a couple. Both were so young when they started dating and then she got pregnant and they fought to try and make a family work for the kids but it only made them hate each other over time. Then he died and my niblings were heartbroken. At 5 and 6 they were young but he was one of their two favorite people.\n\nMy sister has remarried since, about a year ago and she recently learned she was pregnant. She had this big photo perfect announcement planned with her, her husband and the kids, to show their excitement for the new baby arriving and the growing of their blended family. Except my niblings are not excited and this was not a happy thing for them. They told my sister they didn't want to be part of her announcement and when she asked why, they said they kind of hate that she is pregnant with someone else's baby and they don't want to be a blended family. She was heartbroken. She questioned them on why and they said her husband is just her husband and not their dad and this baby \"isn't dad's\" and how they wouldn't have chosen for a baby to come along.\n\nIt's been weeks now and my sister is mourning the announcement she planned and I think she is holding onto some negative feelings toward the kids. I think she dropped the ball a lot on this because clearly she never asked her kids how they felt about her husband or about the changes that had come into their lives. She just assumed they were happy and now her bubble has burst.\n\nThe kids told me the other day she was different with them now and they wondered if they could live with me because they think their mom just wants her new family now and not them if they don't want the new family. This is when I knew I needed to speak to my sister. She told me how much of a shock it was for her kids to say they weren't excited and didn't want the family they have. She also told me how much it broke her heart that they didn't do the announcement for her and now she won't be able to show the baby this exciting, loving announcement they get older, won't be able to show how the whole family was excited for their arrival. I told her she needs to let go of the fact she won't get her announcement as she wanted it. That she has two kids who need her and she needs to help them through this because they think everyone would be better off if they lived with me and that is not good for them to feel that way. She told me I was being unfair to her and piling on about something she's upset about. I told her she always told me being mom came first, her kids needs came first and that meant sometimes adults had to deal with their own shit quickly. I told her that was what her kids needed right now.\n\nShe still told me I came down too hard but I think it sort of worked. She is still not happy with me though.

Its not like they\u2019re that young, either- both are more than old enough to voice their opinions.\n\nThe kids\u2019 reactions and their mother\u2019s \u201cshock\u201d are enough evidence to me that sh has, indeed, been the AH.  Maybe it was just a massive, gross oversight, and she was so blinded by the new marriage abd pregnancy that she forgot she already has older kids that have their own thoughts and opportunities.  Or she really is trying to just replace them with a new family, idk.\n\nEither way, she dropped the ball hard and your comments either served as a wake-up call, or just calling her out.", "I hate, very very strongly hate, parents who force that perfect blended family fantasy onto their kids without actually getting to know and support what their kids want. \n\nYour sister has long needed to wake up to the fact that it\u2019s not about her or what fantasy she wants to happen. It\u2019s about what her kids need to feel happy, safe, and secure. She needs to get it together because she\u2019s been pretending to live in her own head and literally ignoring the needs of her kids.", "NTA. You said everything she needed to hear. She needs to prioritize her daughters\u2019 needs. \n\nCheck in with the kids regularly. Let them know they\u2019ll always have a place in your home. I hope your sister steps up and gets both her and them the help they all need.", "NTA - Your sister sounds like she has main character syndrome and needed a reality check. She a) assumed that everyone felt the same way as she did about everything, and b) gave her OWN CHILDREN the cold shoulder for having their own emotions that are different than hers, which only validated their concerns that their mom was moving on with her \u201cnew family.\u201d\n\nYour sister is prioritizing her own personal feelings and need for things to be exactly the way she wants them over the emotional well-being of her kids.", "NTA. Your sister is completely clueless about how children in blended families are absolutely terrified. She needs to be reassuring to those children rather than showing too much excitement for the new baby.", "Good on you.  The truth hurts.  A while hell of a lot when you realize you aren't protecting your kids from harm. You're actually causing it.  \n\n\nNTA. honestly, I'm hella glad they have you to talk some sense into your sister", "Honestly I don\u2019t think your sister is really stuck on this photo and announcement. It was the event that clued her into how her kids really feel about the family dynamics. They all need therapy. Desire for a blended family or not isn\u2019t really the kid\u2019s choice. They don\u2019t have another parent. I also think they are too young to be in control of who is parenting and where they are living. Yes they deserve to voice their opinions and desires, but it doesn\u2019t mean they are going to get exactly that. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone is the ah here. It sounds like it is a rough situation that everyone is trying to deal with well meaning intentions. Again, a therapist who specializes in family will be a huge help, if nothing more than a third party who is impartial and helping everyone understand what everyone is thinking, etc.", "When her kids came to talk to you. What did you say to them?", "NAH - the announcement is part of a bigger picture for your sister, as evidenced by the fact that her children have openly expressed that they aren't happy with the situation and that they'd rather live with you. I understand change is hard for children, but unless there is abuse going on in the new household then it's an extreme reaction. Your sister is likely hurting from the situation as a whole.\n\nHowever, the pregnancy announcement is the least of her worries at this stage and you weren't wrong to point it out. \n\nDid her children ever get grief counselling?", "NTA, you only raised a concern to your sister based on what the kid asked you about. Your sister might be finally happy with the new guy and she thought everyone was happy the way she was. It appears that she didn't ask the kids who seems to be getting distant from her and she is trying to figure out why the kids can't be happy for her and welcome the new arrival. The kids feel that with the new baby they may lose their mom and will be getting much less attention, which appears to be the case with the way your sister is acting. So the kids are only going to want nothing to do with the baby and in a few years find their own life. Things like baby sitting or family time would be shunned and the baby will grow up as a single child without much connection with his/ her siblings. Maybe if your sister talked to the kids and worked something out, it could have a much happier ending.", "NTA. As much as it isn't what she wanted to hear, she needed to hear it.

Your niblings told you, they are worried their mum wants to replace them with her new baby/family. That should be a wake up call for your sister. It was just an announcement, her children need her.

You are telling her that her kids want to stop living with her and she is replying you're being mean wahhh. I'd be really disappointed in her. Hopefully she shapes up but I doubt it. NTA. You tried.", "NTA thank you for standing up for your niblings", "NTA\n\nYou were right and she knows it.

She should focus on making sure that baby has a happy family going forward instead of a picture to look back on.", "NTA and I hope she keeps listening to you. She\u2019s got some work to put in to be a good parent right note. It centers around the kids she already has and it\u2019s not going to be glamorous and cute.", "NTA, she apparently said it herself kids come first.", "Agree NTA. Those kids need to see they\u2019re still a priority for her.

I think she did get wrapped up in the whirlwind of her new marriage and I think she saw the baby as a tie that wraps them all together perfectly now and she didn't stop to ask if her kids WANTED to be wrapped together forever.", "They are still children and I agree with that. But normally when the dramatic stuff flares up, you would expect them to say they are leaving to the parent(s) or just make a big announcement. The kids approached me and asked to come live with in private and they seemed very serious about it.\n\nI don't disagree that she's entitled to her happiness but clearly she didn't know her kids were unhappy and they don't see this baby as a good thing, or fully see the baby as a sibling. Just her baby with someone who is not their dad. That is stuff complicated and maybe they will always feel that way, maybe not, but clearly the kids need help.", "It happens. Especially when you are young and the sex is good, which is something my sister said once. But sex doesn't always mean you will make a good couple. Even having kids together doesn't mean you will work well as a couple.", "Nah keep at it. Fuck her feelings right now. Her kids feelings are more important and therapy is needed\n Just find a way to word it the right way. Follow up and ask her how she\u2019s doing with the bombshell.", "And the way the kids say she\u2019s treating them differently. They have these doubts and suspicions that are not being helped by her treatment. They just told her the truth and she made it about herself.", "Agreed, i dont think so either.  But from her kids' perspectives, i can see that being the obvious conclusion to them since they won't associate the new husband with the same kind of happiness as their mother, who wasn't on great terms with their deceased dad in the first place.  I think you gave her a much-needed wake-up call - from an adult and not just her children - that she can't really dismiss too easily.  Hopefully things can work out for them", "I imagine for the children it snot about what she's doing, but more about how they feel about what she seems to be doing? And  many kids feel jealous that things will change for them specifically. In these children's case they have lost a lot already. Some kids resist change. That's not unnatural either. Its about comfort level.", "[deleted]", "Oh I totally understand. My sister was in a relationship with a much older man (her 18 him 29). He was not attractive and was not mentally stable \u201cbut the sex was good\u201d. \n\nAnd I just mean that their relationship was on the rocks with the first kid and they managed to have another one. I don\u2019t mean to insinuate these children are mistakes because it sounds like their father loved them very much. I have to imagine they didn\u2019t plan the first and especially were not careful before being pregnant with the second\u2026 don\u2019t be silly wrap your Willy kids!", "Yes, exactly. I hope so too because they were genuinely very close before and I know my sister loves her kids and they love her.", "I don't expect my sister to drop the baby off anywhere. But her kids need to not feel like she's going to be forever angry at them and distant with them because they don't feel the way she wants them to. The fact she continues to bring up the announcement and how she didn't get the one she wanted is not going to help bring them closer together. I also don't think telling them mom's husband is great, baby will be great will help. I think therapy will be needed. I think they will need to talk about their loss and the fact they lost their dad and now mom is with someone else, happily. While they are still wishing for their dad. I would understand if my sister had focused more on how sad she is that the kids feel that way toward the baby. But she seemed more upset about the announcement and I am not the only person who thought this.", "Okay, gotcha. Yeah. They had the kids pretty close together so I think they learned after #2 but also... I think their relationship went really downhill after their son was born. But both were amazing parents. They loved their kids even when they hated each other and they always made sure their kids had a good life.\n\nI hate that the kids lost him. He was a great father to them.", "NTA. At this point, you need to advocate for your  'niblings'. You're right, they need therapy, preferably a children's grief counsellor. Your sister is selfish, but I do wonder if she's suffering from the toxicity of her previous relationship with their father and his death? People behave out-of-character when traumatised. If she has always been like this, then her upset at not getting the perfect announcement is shallow and those kids are gonna need your support.", "[deleted]", "It's not an advice sub or one for you to backseat drive someone else's life. OP asked for judgement, not nagging or did yous or should'ves.", "NAH. Your sister sounds like somebody who\u2019s been so unhappy for so long, and is now experiencing marital happiness - and hope - for the first time in a long time.\n\nShe finally has a marriage she wants, and a child being brought into what she thought was a healthy happy home \u2014 only to realize that her kids are unhappy. The reality she thought existed actually doesn\u2019t. That\u2019s hard for anyone.\n\nIf her kids could go back in time, they would clearly undo the marriage, and still have their dad around. But for your sister, all of that would preclude her new, happy marriage, and the tiny life she is carrying inside of her. That must sting *deeply* for both parties: there\u2019s no happy medium there.", "NAH \n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like the kids\u2019 behavior suggested any issues before now. Should she have checked in? I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s something a little off to me about asking your kids how they feel about you having a baby before you start trying, but I agree a proactive conversation would be ideal. \n\nShe\u2019s grieving, they\u2019re grieving, she needed a direct talk and she got it.", "NAH. You did come down harsh but she did need to hear it. I mean you did paint her as this callous mother who doesn\u2019t care at all about her kids only the announcement. But it sounds like the first thing she brought up to you was her kids feelings and being concerned and then brought up the announcement. She\u2019s allowed to be concerned about her kids and also disappointed her expectations aren\u2019t a reality with the announcement.", "NAH. Your sister needs to discuss this with her children. Yes. But that they rejected their sibling she\u2019s pregnant with like that ALSO means your sister gets to have hurt feelings. Parenting isn\u2019t being completely devoid of emotions. It\u2019s likely the kids were happy and there wasn\u2019t anything for your sister to be overly concerned about until the pregnancy. It\u2019s a huge changing dynamic. Having new siblings when you\u2019re a decade older is difficult even in a nuclear family. The outlier child is more like an only child and the older children often end up in partial parenting roles. Your sister has a lot of work ahead to \u201cblend\u201d her family. She\u2019s also pregnant and hormonal. But it sounds like she\u2019s raised great kids who have good relationships with safe adults in their lives. That\u2019s the goal. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll figure it out. Right now being upset over the pregnancy announcement is probably a buffer to the rejection the baby just received from the siblings. My kids know that if they\u2019re uncomfortable coming to me, for whatever reason, Auntie is there for them. It truly takes a village.", "NTA It broke my heart how they said they wanted to live with you so mom can have her new family. Those poor kids. She needs to do family therapy asap. She should have already done it and she would have known how they were feeling.", "YTA, it's not bad to call your sister's attention but if you do it with no empathy and you certainly had some cruelty, you start by saying that your sister was trapped in an unhappy marriage, and as you said she was in a bubble of happiness, and now That it broke is sad, where is your concern for your sister? It's okay that you worry about your sister, but why call her a bad mother? your sister. How has your sister changed with your nephews? You yell at them, leave them without food, tell them that you hate them? I guess not because you don't mention it, she is sad and obviously doesn't have the energy to be the best mother in the world; Did you do anything to comfort her after her kids humiliated her (whether they're kids or not, that's what they did), or are you only there when it comes to shaming her?", ">She still told me I came down too hard but I think it sort of worked\n\nWelp, hard or not, hopefully it did work! Otherwise later she shouldn't be surprised when her kids move out at 18 and go NC", "Not the main point, but the idea of this child caring about their pregnancy announcement photos when they\u2019re older is bizarre to me. Maybe it\u2019s just because at 37 I\u2019m not from a generation who got announced in such a formal way, but is that a thing? I feel like my reaction would be somewhere between \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t want to actively think about my parents having unprotected sex.\u201d", "NTA. It seems to me like she cares more about appearance of a happy family and not so much the actual happiness of her family. The picture perfect announcement isn\u2019t going to mean shit 10 years from now if it\u2019s just a miserable memory for her two children. They shouldn\u2019t feel like they have to do this and be ok with the situation in order for their mom to be happy and love them. Was there a huge picture perfect family announcement when they were born? I\u2019m going to guess no. She\u2019s going to send the message that they weren\u2019t a \u201chappy family\u201d until new husband and new baby came along. Therapy waiting to happen for these kids.

I would maybe reach out an olive branch after things have calmed down for the sake of the relationship, but she needs to sit on your words for a short while imo. You say you think it worked, so see how she deals now and have another talk not to apologise but with the intention of clearing the air. You did the right thing, you advocated for those kids who sound like they aren't coping very well.", "NTA. Pregnancy announcements are a relatively new thing, and for her to be this hung up on it is a little odd. She should focus on healing the relationship with her kids rather than harping on a one-time photograph.", "NTA. If your sister wants a happy blended family, she will have to work for it, and the longer she doesn't do this, the harder it will be to get the outcome she wants.", "NTA Look, she's gonna be mad at you for a while but likely it's displaced feelings and she's actually mad at herself. You did the right thing. Just keep being there for your niblings and hopefully your sister will come around.", "NTA. You're looking out for your niece and nephew. Chances are if your sister focuses on them, maybe talks to them, takes them to therapy they could be happy, and be happy about a sibling (eventually).", "NTA you have done everything right in this situation", "Your not the AH but here is advice ,\n\n\nTake your sister to court if the kids want to live with you then the court will respect that decision since they are at the age where they are legally allowed to make their own choices", "NTA \n\nTreating her kids differently because they didn't follow the plot line she'd written in her head is not okay. They need support right now.", "This hits home for me because this was my worst fear for most of my childhood. One parent dies, the other gets remarried and starts a new family. I know that irl kids don\u2019t get a say in these matters, but as a kid your whole life is your family, and school. Your home life is extremely important and not having control over that is/was terrifying. \n\nI\u2019m going with NTA which makes your sister TA. She has two kids who are so unhappy they want to get out of the house. I\u2019m glad they have an aunt they can tell these things to. Good for you for speaking with your sister. I know I\u2019m projecting here but I think she is a huge asshole for putting her new husband and baby before her existing children. They lost their dad and they\u2019re losing their mom to this fantasy of hers that she\u2019s too wrapped up in to be attuned to the very valid feelings of her kids", "NTA. Hope your sister gets over this quickly as it is already harming her relationship with her kids.

That just underscores the kids feelings, they'd rather move than deal with husband and baby.\n\nPoor kids.", "I don't think they did notice. I know they have said things before that makes me think they really believed their parents loved each other and were happy together. It might be something they realize now, perhaps. But it definitely wasn't always.", "I'd say that if this is all coming as a shock to the mom, then she clearly hasn't talked to the kids at all about this. If she'd asked them at all, this wouldn't be a surprise. They clearly don't like new husband and they don't like their mom having a baby. This isn't new behavior. She's just finally asked them and found out.\n\nAnd tbh? It might never be okay for the kids. Some parents never remarry because they put their kids comfort first. I don't necessarily agree with that. I don't think a widowed/divorced party needs to remain alone forever because their kids lost a parent. But they ARE going to be part of the family, so either parent left should be discussing with them about it. If they're really torn over 'my kids hate my partner but I really love them', then they can't be that surprised when their kids never take to them.\n\nSo I guess the answer is that the parent doesn't have to be alone for long, if at all, but they do have to realize that their kids might not like their partner. Maybe that's okay? Maybe it's not. Sometimes there's valid reasons for kids not liking the new partner. Sometimes there's not. That won't make them like them any more. But I have a feeling that mom just didn't check in at all. They're 10/11. She probably thinks 'they're too young' to have a conversation about adult relationships. Frankly, she should have had them in therapy. Seems they were giving off some pretty visible signals they weren't happy, but she was just too busy in her happy new life bubble.

There is nowhere in this post indicating that the mother is actually treating the kids differently, just that they feel she is with no actual details, I would imagine this means they can just tell she is upset/disappointed, and they are taking it as a personal slight as children do. The wanting to move part is very obviously coming from their frustration that change is happening and they want to be in control.\n\nTheir father died 5 years ago. Is the mother expected to never move on? Never look after her own needs?\n\nShe is not neglecting the children to do so. Kids do not get to tell their parents what to do, and they have had 5 years, this is not sudden. Parents are allowed to remarry, and have more children if they so please. This isn't a case of the mother marrying someone horrible or trying to replace them with new siblings, this is a mother who has already given her time neglecting her own feelings and who wants everyone happy.\n\nMothers should not be shamed for wanting everyone to be happy, and should not be expected to make themselves unhappy to \"put the kids first\". The kids are being cared for.", "She would know if she asked. She is the parent here and should be touching base with them and having these conversations because they're still literal children that may need some help navigating complex feelings.", "She would know if she asked them. Which is what a good parent would do.", "They are not whiney brats. They are grieving kids who are struggling with change and who need love and support and help to deal with these changes and how much their world has changed, in ways they wouldn't have wanted them to change.", "10/11 year olds who lost their father are not whiny brats for not being happy about a new sibling, their reaction is completely normal. Also they are NOT responsible for their mother's feelings, it goes the other way around. Children should never feel they need to suppress what they actually think and feel to protect their parents' feelings", "Really? Thats the message you got from this? That is a horrible take", "That would be such a wonderful memory to have together. It also may be useful to help her remember in the future", "That is a beautiful idea. If your mom is able I\u2019m sure she\u2019d cherish that time with you and you\u2019ll have a cherished keepsake!! I hope you do it!!", "Maybe it is more of a new revelation for them because seeing their mom so happy makes them realize what they thought was happiness wasn\u2019t. And while I\u2019m reality that may only apply to the husband/partner aspect of the situation, the kids can\u2019t make that distinction. So to them, it\u2019s if mom wasn\u2019t actually happy with dad then was she not happy with us either? If new husband makes mom real happy then will new baby make mom real happy? These kids are drowning in feelings to complex for them to understand. So they\u2019re trying to rationalize them on their own by what they see. They know mom is different now than before their dad passed, and now they\u2019re  scared that they are not enough to make their mom happy. But new baby will be enough.", "Kids, even infants, can pick up on these things.", "Yes a therapist is definitely in order and it\u2019s sad if the parents didn\u2019t have that in place for them already.", "They don't hate him but I don't see much care for him either. It seems like he's just a guy to them. Not someone they love or hate. Though they seem to have a tough time with him being there and not their dad.\n\nShe is definitely different with them since this and honestly, it sounds like she's been different in some ways too since she started dating her husband. But I definitely noticed a slight resentment there. Like she's frustrated with them for not being happy and jumping into all of this excited and I do understand that this relationship is healthier and better for her and she's excited. But a few years ago she would have had no doubts about her kids feelings on something like this. They would have talked about it because she would have asked them. She was always a big believer in that.\n\nThough in saying that I was always surprised she never got them grief therapy.", "I see that. I guess i was also wondering she must not be in tune with her children and their feelings and processes for a while now if this came as a huge shock to her. \n\n\nAbsolutely she can mourn all she wants. But treating the children differently because of their feelings to the point of wanting to move out their house is not right. She can absolutely process it but you cannot take it out on the kids for \u201cweeks\u201d.", "\u201c The kids told me the other day she was different with them now and they wondered if they could live with me because they think their mom just wants her new family now and not them if they don't want the new family. \u201d\n\nI guess I am reading into this differently than you have. Also, sister did not deny her behavior towards the kids and say she is not treating the kids any differently. \n\nI guess we all have different parenting. For me, children never asked to be born. So when they are here and hurting it\u2019s our job to guide them and nurture them through life and yes put them first especially in this heartbreaking situation when the children feel alienated enough when they want to move out of their mothers house, which is a huge huge request. \n\nHopefully you are correct and the kids are being cared for, for me reading that they want to move out, says they are not. But hopefully you are correct.", "I think that is very possible. I never really considered all that but it does make sense.", "Good points.", "They can but how they have talked in the past makes me believe they did not pick up on it.", "I wonder if subconsciously she\u2019s glad their father passed and she could move on. She may not even know this is coming off of her.", "So... if you were monitoring this whole situation so closely (which you obviously were based on all the new info in your comments), why didn't you give your opinions and advice earlier when everything had just started? Like that they should've gotten grief therapy five years ago after the father had died? That you think she's rushing with the new relationship? Instead, you waited for years and expressed yourself in the harshest way possible. What were you expecting to achieve with this approach?", "Poor poor kids, this situation just keeps getting worse. \n\nPlease help them OP if they need to move to a safe space.", "Those kids need counseling. Your sister needs to understand that this is not about her or her happiness. This is about her kids and them needing guidance in navigating complicated feelings and trauma. If your sister wants a happy blended family then she has to start here. She can\u2019t will it into reality. No one is trying to take away her happiness, but hopefully trying to make it stronger and more encompassing. If she can\u2019t set aside her feelings however, that happy family she\u2019s always imagined will only be imagined.", "They thought it was normal until they had something to compare it to."]}
