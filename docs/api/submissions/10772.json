Unfortunately the event concluded in rush hour traffic so we faced an uphill battle getting home in a timely fashion. Almost immediately after entering the freeway a strong urge to pee hit me like a truck. I tried my best to hold it and maintain my composure. I let my friend know that she needed to get off at the nearest exit so I could run in somewhere and use the bathroom. \n\nBut we were not getting anywhere quick after about twenty minutes I couldn\u2019t hold it. I was genuinely going to pee my pants so I started looking for other options. The only one I found was an empty bottle so I decided that I\u2019d pee in it. Unfortunately I missed spectacularly and urine got all over the seats and the floor. \n\nMy friend was very unhappy and yelled at me for trying to pee in the bottle. I was obviously very embarrassed and tried to explain I didn\u2019t have any other choice. I scrubbed her seats with soap and water when we got back. But she still lit into me about how rude and immature I was and how her car was going to smell.

Like you, I have incontinence issues at times, except mine are bowel incontinence due to IBS.  It\u2019s important for you to take control of your medical condition and prepare for things like this, even if you feel a bit embarrassed by having to do that. I have been there myself and I use adult diapers when I may not have access to a bathroom for a while.  It gives me the security I need that if something goes wrong I won\u2019t be soiling a vehicle.  It\u2019s also far less embarrassing to wear something protective or to have a backup plan than it is to have an accident.\n\nI\u2019m going to have to sadly say that YTA in this situation because you have not taken control of your medical issues by providing yourself with backup in situations like that.  You also don\u2019t seem to have offered to have her car professionally cleaned, which you really need to do in order to make this right.

Why didn't you preemptively go to the bathroom before getting in the car? Why didn't you have any emergency precautions like disposable underwear? If you don't want to wear disposable incontinence underwear buy some nice washable ones. Several period underwear companies like Knix and Modibodi sell incontinence underwear as well, they even have them for men and children, not just women. \n\nThere are medical treatments like working with a pelvic floor physical therapist or surgery that could help too. You have to be proactive and take responsibility for your incontinence instead of risking peeing on other people's things or in public places. It's rude and unsanitary.", "YTA because it is NOT cool to pee in someone\u2019s car regardless the situation. You need to offer to get the car cleaned. Since this is an issue, you also need to be honest with people and better prepared. For instance, if I know one of my kids might vomit from car sickness, you better believe I would bring a bucket, baby wipes, toilet paper, a trash bag, and change of clothes with me in my car, just in case the medicine doesn\u2019t work. You need to prepare too. It\u2019s better to have tools on hand to make life easier. A simple fix is buying a travel toilet that lots of parents use for kids in the car.

Don't beat yourself up. \n\nIf this was a repeat pattern for you, you would be the asshole. But you mentioned this is only the 3rd time it's ever happened.

Explain yourself and offer to have the car professionally cleaned otherwise you look like a literal child.", "NTA. That sounds awful for you. I\u2019m sure you were already embarrassed. There was no need for her to come at you like that. If my friend had the same issues, I\u2019d be trying to convince her that it\u2019s no big deal instead of making her even more uncomfortable. You should probably pay to get her car cleaned considering her reaction", "Soft YTA you are very aware of your issue, all you had to do was wear an incontinence pad and it wouldn't have been a problem. I know you can't predict traffic jams or store lines but when you know there's a possibility you need to take precautions. The pads are as small as a sanitary napkin so no one would know the difference", "NTA. Honestly, even without the medical condition sometimes you just have to go and I can completely understand not wanting to go on the side of the road.

It's devastating that your friend would yell at you over something like this. Accidents happen. I can understand being frustrated about having to clean up your car (which you did for her) but screaming at your friend for their medical condition is ridiculous.

You need to wear the pee pads or adult diapers. That is the bare minimum preventative measure you could have taken that would have prevented this. If you are a prepared for a situation you don\u2019t have to worry about being AFAB and peeing in a water bottle on the freeway.

I'm not going to pass a judgement here, you've had enough of that.  A lot of people have said YWBTA if you did not get the seats professionally cleaned, but you are 22, and might not have money for that.  So I'm going to offer up another option for you.  Go to PetSmart and buy an enzymatic urine spray. Shouldn't cost more than $20. It will break down the urine and cause it to no longer smell.  Once it's dry, THEN scrub the seats. Make sure you scrub the entire seat so that the top and bottom match (don't want the bottom to be cleaner than the top).  Then take your friend's car through a good car wash.  It will show them that you are truly sorry and fix the actual issue (pee on the seats).\n\nThen, please make yourself an actual kit for long trips.  I know it sucks. I now carry a backpack with all the things I need for my disability. Bring a she-wee, a puppy pad or two, a large ziplock bag to stuff soiled things in.

If it's an especially long trip (a couple hours away), even pack a change of clothes, just in case.\n\nDisabilities suck, but you don't have to make them suck more by being unprepared.

You can still enjoy your day.

I am a Pelvic Floor PT. I think you could really benefit from at least consulting with a professional in your area. In the meantime, while it may feel as though you can\u2019t control your bladder, kegels are a really helpful tool to suppress the peeing reflex. If you have never been taught how to do this, imagine you are trying to suck a thick milkshake up with your nether regions. When you feel a really strong urge to pee: stop what you\u2019re doing, kegel as hard as you can five times(curl your toes at the same time for a stronger contraction), and tell your bladder that it\u2019s job is to store, it can handle this. That should overcome the reflex that is making you feel the need to pee until you can get to a toilet. Someone commented earlier that kegels are not encouraged for those with an overactive pelvic floor which is absolutely correct, so that is where consulting with a pelvic floor PT would be helpful.
