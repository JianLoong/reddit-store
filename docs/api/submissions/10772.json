Unfortunately the event concluded in rush hour traffic so we faced an uphill battle getting home in a timely fashion. Almost immediately after entering the freeway a strong urge to pee hit me like a truck. I tried my best to hold it and maintain my composure. I let my friend know that she needed to get off at the nearest exit so I could run in somewhere and use the bathroom. \n\nBut we were not getting anywhere quick after about twenty minutes I couldn\u2019t hold it. I was genuinely going to pee my pants so I started looking for other options. The only one I found was an empty bottle so I decided that I\u2019d pee in it. Unfortunately I missed spectacularly and urine got all over the seats and the floor. \n\nMy friend was very unhappy and yelled at me for trying to pee in the bottle. I was obviously very embarrassed and tried to explain I didn\u2019t have any other choice. I scrubbed her seats with soap and water when we got back. But she still lit into me about how rude and immature I was and how her car was going to smell.

Like you, I have incontinence issues at times, except mine are bowel incontinence due to IBS.  It\u2019s important for you to take control of your medical condition and prepare for things like this, even if you feel a bit embarrassed by having to do that. I have been there myself and I use adult diapers when I may not have access to a bathroom for a while.  It gives me the security I need that if something goes wrong I won\u2019t be soiling a vehicle.  It\u2019s also far less embarrassing to wear something protective or to have a backup plan than it is to have an accident.\n\nI\u2019m going to have to sadly say that YTA in this situation because you have not taken control of your medical issues by providing yourself with backup in situations like that.  You also don\u2019t seem to have offered to have her car professionally cleaned, which you really need to do in order to make this right.

Why didn't you preemptively go to the bathroom before getting in the car? Why didn't you have any emergency precautions like disposable underwear? If you don't want to wear disposable incontinence underwear buy some nice washable ones. Several period underwear companies like Knix and Modibodi sell incontinence underwear as well, they even have them for men and children, not just women. \n\nThere are medical treatments like working with a pelvic floor physical therapist or surgery that could help too. You have to be proactive and take responsibility for your incontinence instead of risking peeing on other people's things or in public places. It's rude and unsanitary.", "YTA because it is NOT cool to pee in someone\u2019s car regardless the situation. You need to offer to get the car cleaned. Since this is an issue, you also need to be honest with people and better prepared. For instance, if I know one of my kids might vomit from car sickness, you better believe I would bring a bucket, baby wipes, toilet paper, a trash bag, and change of clothes with me in my car, just in case the medicine doesn\u2019t work. You need to prepare too. It\u2019s better to have tools on hand to make life easier. A simple fix is buying a travel toilet that lots of parents use for kids in the car.

Don't beat yourself up. \n\nIf this was a repeat pattern for you, you would be the asshole. But you mentioned this is only the 3rd time it's ever happened.

Explain yourself and offer to have the car professionally cleaned otherwise you look like a literal child.", "NTA. That sounds awful for you. I\u2019m sure you were already embarrassed. There was no need for her to come at you like that. If my friend had the same issues, I\u2019d be trying to convince her that it\u2019s no big deal instead of making her even more uncomfortable. You should probably pay to get her car cleaned considering her reaction", "Soft YTA you are very aware of your issue, all you had to do was wear an incontinence pad and it wouldn't have been a problem. I know you can't predict traffic jams or store lines but when you know there's a possibility you need to take precautions. The pads are as small as a sanitary napkin so no one would know the difference", "NTA. Honestly, even without the medical condition sometimes you just have to go and I can completely understand not wanting to go on the side of the road.

It's devastating that your friend would yell at you over something like this. Accidents happen. I can understand being frustrated about having to clean up your car (which you did for her) but screaming at your friend for their medical condition is ridiculous.
