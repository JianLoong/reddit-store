Unfortunately the event concluded in rush hour traffic so we faced an uphill battle getting home in a timely fashion. Almost immediately after entering the freeway a strong urge to pee hit me like a truck. I tried my best to hold it and maintain my composure. I let my friend know that she needed to get off at the nearest exit so I could run in somewhere and use the bathroom. \n\nBut we were not getting anywhere quick after about twenty minutes I couldn\u2019t hold it. I was genuinely going to pee my pants so I started looking for other options. The only one I found was an empty bottle so I decided that I\u2019d pee in it. Unfortunately I missed spectacularly and urine got all over the seats and the floor. \n\nMy friend was very unhappy and yelled at me for trying to pee in the bottle. I was obviously very embarrassed and tried to explain I didn\u2019t have any other choice. I scrubbed her seats with soap and water when we got back.

I have been there myself and I use adult diapers when I may not have access to a bathroom for a while.  It gives me the security I need that if something goes wrong I won\u2019t be soiling a vehicle.

You also don\u2019t seem to have offered to have her car professionally cleaned, which you really need to do in order to make this right.

Why didn't you preemptively go to the bathroom before getting in the car? Why didn't you have any emergency precautions like disposable underwear? If you don't want to wear disposable incontinence underwear buy some nice washable ones. Several period underwear companies like Knix and Modibodi sell incontinence underwear as well, they even have them for men and children, not just women. \n\nThere are medical treatments like working with a pelvic floor physical therapist or surgery that could help too. You have to be proactive and take responsibility for your incontinence instead of risking peeing on other people's things or in public places. It's rude and unsanitary.", "YTA because it is NOT cool to pee in someone\u2019s car regardless the situation. You need to offer to get the car cleaned. Since this is an issue, you also need to be honest with people and better prepared. For instance, if I know one of my kids might vomit from car sickness, you better believe I would bring a bucket, baby wipes, toilet paper, a trash bag, and change of clothes with me in my car, just in case the medicine doesn\u2019t work. You need to prepare too. It\u2019s better to have tools on hand to make life easier. A simple fix is buying a travel toilet that lots of parents use for kids in the car.

Explain yourself and offer to have the car professionally cleaned otherwise you look like a literal child.", "NTA. That sounds awful for you. I\u2019m sure you were already embarrassed. There was no need for her to come at you like that. If my friend had the same issues, I\u2019d be trying to convince her that it\u2019s no big deal instead of making her even more uncomfortable. You should probably pay to get her car cleaned considering her reaction", "Soft YTA you are very aware of your issue, all you had to do was wear an incontinence pad and it wouldn't have been a problem. I know you can't predict traffic jams or store lines but when you know there's a possibility you need to take precautions. The pads are as small as a sanitary napkin so no one would know the difference", "NTA. Honestly, even without the medical condition sometimes you just have to go and I can completely understand not wanting to go on the side of the road.

It's devastating that your friend would yell at you over something like this. Accidents happen. I can understand being frustrated about having to clean up your car (which you did for her) but screaming at your friend for their medical condition is ridiculous.

Traffic is a thing, and flat tires and car breakdowns happen.\n\nI had a leaking problem for a bit after I had my second kid, and speaking from experience, I found it way more comfortable to just wear a pad designed for that kind of thing and change it if necessary. Much easier than having to change my underwear and worry about it leaking through to my pants.", "I have bladder incontinence. Not all the time, not always massive accidents\u2026 Pretty much like you. Long journeys/times I won\u2019t be able to easily access a bathroom? I make sure I wear supplies like incontinence pants. Is it embarrassing? Yes. Is it a medical condition which is my responsibility to manage? Yes. Is it my responsibility to inform those around me despite how embarrassing it is so they have an understanding? Yes.\n\nSorry\u2026 However? It is an AH move not to prepare for an accident when you have had them before and know it could be a possibility. Yes\u2026 You cleaned up after yourself but you shouldn\u2019t have put yourself in that position or your friends in that position. If you had taken every precaution? You wouldn\u2019t be TA. It\u2019s the fact you didn\u2019t that makes you one.", "So this has happened before. \nDid you go to the toilet after the event and before getting in the car?\nDid you make any attempt to mitigate this?\nSurely you realised there was a likelihood of traffic. \nYTA because this is a condition you are fully aware of having, and you have had episode of completely losing control before, and you did nothing to prepare for this. Adult diapers or indeed incontinence underwear exist. Have you paid for your friends car to be professionally cleaned? \nThis is your responsibility to manage, not your friends. You expect understanding for you knowing this was a possibility and choosing not to make preparations.", "Period underwear is supposed to be also able to contain a fair amount of urine. It\u2019s a medical condition but you have to plan for the times when stuff happens. Like carrying an adult diaper- if you are willing to try peeing in a bottle in a car you could always pull one out and put it on", "Op, this is so terrible and I feel bad for you.  Just fyi, There are really great absorbent underwear now that can hold quite a bit of liquid.", "Did you look for any shrubbery or tree cover on the shoulder that you could have gone behind to relieve yourself?", "I can't decide because, I feel you should've been prepared, while at the same time, your friend should be more compassionate, because it's not like you wanted to pee in her car. Regardless, there are urination devices you can buy. They're perfect for getting the urine in a bottle. It's a urination cup with a straw like point. Check them out to see if you'd want to buy one for travel.", "I don\u2019t understand all the AH votes. I threw up in a friend\u2019s car after learning my mother was dying of cancer.

I understand you don\u2019t want to share something personal like that, but unless you do, you do kinda seem like an asshole. People at your age are expected to know how to hold it.

And you\u2019re aware it\u2019s a thing for you. I wouldn\u2019t call you an AH, but it\u2019s a medical condition you can plan ahead for. Keep a heavy flow pad or disposable underwear with you so if you get stuck somewhere this doesn\u2019t happen. I know sometime when you have a new chronic condition it\u2019s tempting to ignore it if you can because you want to feel like a \u201cnormal\u201d healthy adult who doesn\u2019t pee their pants sometimes. But you have to face up reality and be prepared to manage your condition. And you WILL be the AH if you don\u2019t pay to have your friends car cleaned", "Have you tried wearing or carrying large period pads just in case? A few in your purse wouldn't be too bad.", "So you're agreeing that ESH too? \n\n>OP knows she has a condition, but should have worn one of those incontinence undergarments.

Perhaps if you explained your situation to her in confidence she would be understanding? I know I would be.", "You don't have to reveal your medical condition if you're not comfortable. However, even with normal bladders, people can be stuck in a situation where they have to pee and stuck in traffic. It's hard not to feel embarrassed because you know something is wrong. Ultimately, your friend lashed out because she was engaged. And, despite your mistake, it wasn't necessary for her to be cruel and publicly humiliate you.\n\nI had friends who peed or vomited in a car from being too drunk and no one cussed them out because they offered to pay for it to be cleaned or detailed once they sobered up. It doesn't matter if it's vomit, pee, or blood. Accidents happen. Offer to pay for it to be professionally cleaned and try to prepare better in the future.", "Work on this. Tell your friends about it, they are more than likely willing to help out in these situations. It's not worth being super embarrassed by something that we don't have control over.

Like there\u2019s this funnel meant for camping that you can get for situations like you just described, which a friend of mine who had triplets just keeps in her glovebox alongside this special antibacterial washcloth kinda thing. I have been known to wear super thick pads to places like comedy shows because I 100% am gonna piss myself just enough to be self conscious about it if any of the comedians are good.\n\nBodies are weird, which is how I can be reasonably certain that you are not the only young woman you\u2019ve met that has a similar problem or something else they find super embarrassing going on with them; we just don\u2019t really talk about that stuff socially. That\u2019s really alienating and difficult.\n\nOne of the best things about the internet is we *do* get to talk to thousands of strangers and then find solutions to things we\u2019d never ask people we know about. I hope you find something that works for you!\n\nNTA, but your friend would be if she doesn\u2019t drop it.

Well first things first, I'm really sorry you feel this kind of shame about your condition. I know firsthand how debilitating and defeating shame can be. If you're able to afford mental health counseling, I'd recommend it. That can be tough to deal with all on your own. \n\nI'm sorry you're going through this. I'd recommend seeking out stories from other adults with incontinence issues. It may help with feelings of embarrassment.  It's way more common than you would think. Hell, I'm 23 and I have outright shit my pants a couple of times (IBS is a bitch). \n\nIf you really want to keep this person as a friend, you can tell her you have a private medical condition and leave it at that.

But I really made the situation ten times worse", "this isn\u2019t the greatest idea tbh, peeing outside can get someone in severe trouble if a cop or someone reports it and police look into it. most people could get a misdeamor/fined/ and it serious cases register as a sex offender", "Even if she knew she has a right to be pissed.

My point is that this is not a car-destroying unthinkable disaster worth screaming at someone for. This is just a thing that happens. Cars get cleaned. \n\nYour friend was a jerk.

And as I only have one arm, this was far trickier than one might expect. I am going to be much more diligent about traveling with the proper precautions from now on, as that is my responsibility, knowing I'm prone to suddenly vomiting with little warning with very few days where I don't throw up a few\n times at minimum.

Though had recent surgery to help since my bladder had collapsed.", "But you can easily change it. Unlike if you soaked your underwear.

Have you ever tried them??", "Honey, I have pelvic floor issues. It is your responsibility to wear a pad, and a wet pad is a damn sight more comfortable than soaking someone else's car in pee", "They have pretty great dry technology now.  You're young, better figure this out now because it's only going to get worse as you get older.  Time to start trying products and figure out what you like.", "I also have severe pelvic floor issues, and it's been a BIG DEAL trying to get it addressed with PT and multiple different Dr's. I'm 26 now and it started years ago, so I totally understand the shame and embarrassment. However!!!!!! I strongly encourage you to instead be open about it! You'll find that more people in your life have similar, even if not as severe, issues. It's like talking about menstruation. People are so weird about it until it feels normal in the social setting.\n\nGet period underwear. I love them because they're less obtrusive than a pad, and I can't use tampons. I tend to pee a bit if I cough unexpectedly, which is horrifying if it's bad enough I have to run home to change. If I know I won't have easy access to a bathroom during the day, I wear them regardless. Having a maxi pad on hand in your purse, and a She Wee, is also a good idea. It sucks but if it's happened before it's going to happen again. \n\nYou become the AH if you have a known condition with known consequences that you refuse to prepare for.

I have bladder issues that I have made WELL KNOWN to everyone in my social group, even before I know where they came from.
