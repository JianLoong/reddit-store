I would absolutely wash dinner dishes, but not dishes that have been sitting there all week.\n\nThe most recent time my mom asked me to do the dishes I said \u201cno, I won\u2019t be doing that.

I argued that I\u2019m still a college student AND a nurse on 3rd shift so I also do plenty and I\u2019m not lazy.\n\nMy brother joined in telling me that my visits were useless if I didn\u2019t want to help around the house.
