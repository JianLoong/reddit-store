It isn't accidental to keep doing the same thing over and over again. \n\nAlso, just as no means no. Stop means stop. \n\nEveryone's voice matters, especially little voices.

People so often ignore little people saying no or stop because they're children. \n\nThis can put children in very bad situations when they don't think their voice matters, when people show them they can do whatever they want to them despite their protests, that even if they feel hurt or unsafe that it doesnt matter. \n\nIt's so important to teach children bodily autonomy!\n\nSo no.

My mom had my youngest sibling when I was 19 and my mom is also raising my little sibling very similar to how she raised me. I'm an adult now, recovering from a fucked up childhood. And occasionally when needed, I ALWAYS stick up for my baby sister whenever my mom pulls the same shit on her that she did to me, that messed me up. It's never serious enough to call the stupid cops but also serious enough to need to step in. I don't care if she's my mom. I wouldn't be working my ass off trying to recover from a messed up childhood if someone had also stuck up for me like I do for my sister.\n\nOP is the older daughter. She knows exactly what the experience is like. You don't. \n\nOP is NTA.\n\nEdit: some words", "What a ridiculous comment, what you\u2019re saying is basically telling the 5 year old \u201cyour feelings don\u2019t matter as long as dad is having fun\u201d gtfo", "His \u201conly way of showing love\u201d is fighting which is part of the reason that we don\u2019t have a close relationship anymore. Also my sister who is five was begging him to stop because she was being hurt. And you\u2019re over here saying \u201cfuck the five year old feelings and fuck that she\u2019s being hurt! That\u2019s the way he loves you so deal with it!\u201d Great view on the world! Thanks for your feedback though!", "Hard disagree.\n\nI think what OP put in the impressionable 5 year old's mind is that her big sister cares about her and sticks up for her when she needs it, and that it's okay to set boundaries for people to not physically touch you if you don't want them to. If that's the only way the dad knows how to show love but it physically HURTS people and they don't like it, then he's a grown ass adult and needs to learn better. If he doesn't get checked, this 5 year old might grow up thinking that it's \"normal\" to be uncomfortable while people touch you in ways you don't want them to. NOPE.\n\nOP, NTA! I'm glad you stood up for your sister! It sounds like your dad isn't actively trying to hurt anyone, but the fact that he immediately yelled at you after both you AND your sister told him repeatedly to stop and didn't realize what he did wrong is problematic. Do you have another parent you could talk to about this?", "It's stop being \"just daddy roughhousing\" and start being \"daddy hurt me and I begged him to stop\" when she said stop and he didn't listen.", "A Reddit go-to advice - maybe therapy is the answer here. For him, obviously. \nAnd if he doesn't stop and hurts her - it's not by accident. It the very least it's because he doesn't care", "I think the move would be to have a conversation with your father regarding your concerns with him privately (not in front of your sister) because undermining his position in front of your little sister is doing more harm than good.\n\n\nUnless theres abuse, then things are different you do what you gotta do\n\nMuch love though you obviously love your sister and there aint nothing wrong with that ever", "I\u2019m sorry you had to go through that. One of my biggest worries is that I\u2019m going to move out and my dad or my sisters mom will pull some kind of manipulation or start pulling some other crap and my sister won\u2019t be able to get ahold of me or I won\u2019t be there to stop it. I\u2019m glad that you can help your sibling and again I am so sorry that you had to deal with that", "Given the context of the story,  nothing about a previous abuse was stated \nIf the OP wouldve given context of abuse than my answer would be 100% different \n\nIt seems this is the case of a house full of girls and the dad is a guy. Being a dad.\n\nSorry about your fucked up childhood though", "Her mom is his ex wife and my mom is his ex gf. All that would come out of it is another giant fight. My mom has slight anger issues and my dad is well my dad. Then my dad would just yell at me again for telling my mom he was hurting my sister. Then a big fight would break out. The last fight that me and my dad got into ended with my grammi who was also in the fight leaving the house and going back to her house and me leaving for an hour. That would be no where near how bad this theoretical fight would be. If I didn\u2019t have my parents as my parents that would be an amazing idea. Also that was only the second time my sister has ever heard me and my dad even raise voices at each other even though it happens so often. I try my very hardest not to make my dad seem like a bad guy to her because I don\u2019t want her to have the same crappy relationship with our dad that I do.", "I find this comment funny not because it\u2019s bad advice or anything, it\u2019s good advice. It\u2019s just funny because his ex is a therapist\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 He doesn\u2019t mean to hurt anyone it\u2019s purely him not knowing his own strength it\u2019s just so annoying because I tell him constantly that he\u2019s hurting me and my sister when hugging us or playing", "Alright. That\u2019s probably a better idea. Thank you for the advice and feedback", "Ugh I'm sorry. I feel you--my dad was shitty and yelled all the time (although he would also hit), and having a rational conversation would literally never work because he would scream and blame everyone immediately. I'm lucky that my mom has always been pretty great, but talking to her always just ended up with him yelling at all of us, so I totally feel you on not being able to bring it to anyone. I'm sorry :(\n\nI still love that you're looking out for your sister either way, and she'll be able to form her own opinion about your dad and their relationship as she grows up. She might also have a crappy relationship with him, but quite frankly, that would be his own fault! I'm sure you are her will have a strong relationship with each other!", "It only proves the \"not accident\" part. Listen, I'm not saying here he's malicious. But if something happens over and over and over - at some point it cannot be declared an accident anymore. It's lack of consideration, or not giving a damn, or a gazillion of reasons - but accident is not one of them.\nIf he's really striving to be a good parent but missing the mark - try calmly taking to him when your sister is not around and he's not mad. It sucks to parent your parent, but sometimes there is no choice", "It really sucks that your dad was shitty and I\u2019m so so sorry for that. Did you ever hit him back or did you just take it? Also having someone who always goes straight to the blame game is awful and I\u2019m sorry that happened. I am hoping that my sister and I continue to be close though! She already prefers my help with everything and shows favoritism without even trying lol. I\u2019m glad that your mom was always nice to you though! It\u2019s always good to have at least one nice parent!", "Ok. I feel like I kinda knew it wasn\u2019t an accident deep down but have just been trying not to accept it if that makes sense? I never talk to him about stuff like that around my sister because I don\u2019t want her to have a bad image of him. But I will do that. Thank you so much.", "It totally makes sense. He is your dad as well and you want him to be a good guy, I get it. But you need to reassess the situation. Dealing with what really is always beats dealing with what you wish it would be.\nBest of luck. You can always reach out to me if you need advice or just an ear.", "Thank you and I\u2019m always here for you too", "I don't understand.  Your father was pretending to be sleeping and your sister didn't like it?  Like, huh?  Why is this behavior that needs to be stopped and how is that being rough with her?  Seems like you omitted a good part of the story here.", "NTA, he sounds a bit like my dad (who would always 'play' extremely rough to try and get a reaction out of us, when we'd end up getting upset he would then yell at us for being sensitive/weak). His yelling at you definitely is defensiveness. It's really important for your sister to know that asking someone to stop or saying no means they need to (even if everyone is just joking/playing around). I'm really sorry you had to deal with it, I just want you to know his immaturity isn't your responsibility and he's definitely in the wrong. I wish I could do more to help you, but just wanted you to know that his behaviour isn't okay and I'm proud of you.", "NTA - stop is an important word. We teach kids to say that word, because that is the only thing they can to. Your father teaches you sister, she is helpless, powerless and weak.\n\n\nBut: yelling allways gives you opponents an advantage to change the topic. You Dad is a bully. You caught him making a mistake. But you also gave him the opportunity to only talk about your mistake.\n\nHe will continue. And even though I think he is unfair and unreasonable, I think the best thing for your sister is: first apologize fit yelling. Then explain what made you angry. Then ask him to respect your sisters boundaries.", "NTA. He doesn't seem to respect other people's bodies. That's a terrible habit to have and awful to do to little kids.", "NTA OP.", "Being clumsy us different from ignoring her when she says no, tho.", "Just want to throw something in here.\n\nGrowing up I have never been able to get a good gauge on my own strength, I have constantly hurt people on accident ranging from people I played tag with as a child thinking I was slapping them on the back or play wrestling with my partner and having too tight of a grip.\n\nNone of this is intentional, when another person recoils in pain it actually makes me jump as well because on my end I am being as gentle as possible... I instantly become as apologetic as possible through sheer panic because the last thing I intend to do is hurt somebody. \n\nIf I gripped my partners wrist too tight though I certainly wouldn't do it while pretending to be asleep so I could hurt her for longer.. that sounds intentional as fuck. \n\nWhether he has a complete disregard for peoples personal boundaries or gets off on causing discomfort on pain for others is something you should get to the bottom of. Because if its the former than he needs to get a grip, and if its the latter you need to get out."]}
