This type of talk may lead her to settle for someone undeserving just so she feels like she's meeting family standards. \n\n\nI think you should send her an apology and tell her you're proud of her for not settling just because others have and that you understand how loneliness can feel and that next time you do something as a family you will include her in decisions that effect her time and her wallet! \n\n\nAsk her to coffee or lunch or to get your nails done, the two of you or with her sister too. The number of her years means nothing, she is still the same little girl who has the same love language she always had for her family. \n\n\nI don't really see anyone being TA here BC you're clearly realizing that your words had power.

Maybe she wanted comfort and reassurance and a reminder that just because it SEEMS like she's the only person struggling, she's doing a lot of things right. She might also have been clamping down on those feelings to keep them from spurting out all over everyone and ruining the event itself, and considering you someone safe to vent to\n\nDoes she really merit approaching the conversation entirely with anger and pushback? Do you really just think she's a selfish whiny loser? This was a good method of sending a message along those lines. \n\nI am absolutely not suggesting you force couples not to be affectionate over the weekend, or that you listen to her say whatever wild shit she wants without pushback. However, there are ways of being able to validate people emotionally without giving ground in a logistical sense. \n\nYou can let her know that it's really upsetting and offensive to hear after the fact about something horrible people were apparently doing, without any warning or attempt to calibrate her feelings to reality. It can also be really hard to hear all the ugly mad self-loathing thoughts a loved one has, because of course we want to help them make it better, make it hurt less, but this is a situation where she can't really be talked down into less drama, or granted her wishes for next time. If you lay it out like that\u2014that you love her, but right now you're IN the situation she completely hates and have other people you love doing the things that cause her pain\u2014she might be able to agree to stop leaving these emotional bags of flaming poop on your doorstep when you're just tired and want to go home, and complain to someone who doesn't have to validate her feelings while also juggling 15 other considerations the whole time. \n\nIt sucks! It's gonna be hard! When I did my own stuff like this with my mother, I finally dragged us to a relationship counsellor, because we each have different approaches to life and trauma-informed pasts that make talking about stuff this intense really difficult because we really quickly get overwhelmed and stop listening to each other. \n\nI suspect right now she is really aching for connection, but also angry and a little paranoid and waiting for it to blow up into a fight.

I highly recommend therapy. But sometimes you need to be brutally honest. For her to find that happiness with someone else, she needs to find happiness within herself. She needs to learn to make herself happy and not expect it to come from others. Instead of searching for someone to fall in love with, she needs to fall in love with herself first.

You all did family activit\u00e9s during the day, you can\u2019t be made accountable to do family things 24/7. Maybe I was just raised differently but my family vacations often had people doing their own things! I mean when I was about her age I went on a family cruise and went to the beach by myself because I wanted to chill and then went shopping by myself while my family did other things! Honestly she needs to grow up, sorry if that is a harsh statement but seriously she is an adult!", "NTA. But your kid? She needs help. All those nights were the perfect time to reflect upon what she wants in a relationship. Why didn't her bf go? Did she actually tell him he was invited?

Why is your daughter drawn to such unhealthy relationships?  What help does she need to form healthier attachments? Also, your daughter isn\u2019t being fair.  It\u2019s not personal that couples were acting like couples.  But did you also plan activities that were not couple based?  No one wants to be the odd man out.  Everyone has room for growth here.", "NTA. Sometimes people just need a reality check. Your daughter is the main character in her own life, but she\u2019s only a guest star in the lives of others. If they were making insensitive comments about her being the only single person on the trip, that\u2019d be one thing, but it sounds like they were just\u2026enjoying themselves. \n\nFrankly, getting left alone at times during a large family trip sounds like a breath of fresh air to me, but to each their own.", "Maybe there's a reason she finds terrible relationships and toxic men..maybe she has never felt like she's enough. We don't know the history of her childhood. Maybe she lacked something.aybe she always felt left out.

I\u2019m sure that might\u2019ve made her feel a bit left out that everyone else had their S.O. but her. Regardless, I don\u2019t think what you said to her was overtly harsh or untrue.

She can complain about everything under the sun. But the one person she can't lie to is herself. She knows who she is and water life is that way and if she does nothing to change it nobody can help her. She'll come back. She knows what's right. She knows what's wrong.", "NTA", "I am very deeply disturbed by the amount of people who think that \u201ccouple\u201d is like an unmovable state of being.

So much for being a close-knit family...\n\nShe, on the other hand, is clearly getting unreasonable: I understand the frustration, but \"people should not PDA if I'm around\" is ridiculous - and it likely comes from a place of deep pain.

She may even be actually depressed and frozen - unable to see why she has such \"bad luck\" in relationships. The lashing out and anger about seeing couples being happy and affectionate together is definitely a sign she is feeling depressed/helpless, and it is SO HARD to see others happy when you're very much not.", "Very hard to make a call on this one without knowing the precise conversation. Yes, exactly as you\u2019ve written it, I\u2019d lean slightly to your side and say N T A.

Your treating her like she is failing at life because she is single at 27, she is still young, give her a break\n\nB.  This feels intentionally exclusionary.

Like what\u2019s the point of coming together I\u2019d you all just dip.\n\nI don\u2019t like the daughter complaining, but then again if I went to family event after family event just to find out it\u2019s really a couples retreat I\u2019d be pissed to", "Idk. I was with you until you said you planned a family trip, but left her by herself or made her feel like a third/fifth/whatever wheel.

She probably needed to hear that even if she didn't like it. Maybe it'll lead to self-reflection. Also, she probably needs therapy if her toxic relationships are a pattern. That'd probably help her view things differently if she's open and willing.", "This is a tough one. You didn't kid glove her and it sounds like she is a place where she could use therapy/the kid gloves. I wouldn't expect a stranger to wear the kid gloves, or even a more distant relative. But a parent generally gets expected to be more gentle about this stuff. You admit she complains a lot about this, but you don't mention whether you have tried to get that statement of yours across in a more gentle manner or not.  \n\n\nIn general the exact tone you used is what I would use to determine if you are a AH or not. But I think I will give a tentative NTA here since your other comments here indicate she had the option to bring someone etc. Probably need to apologize for how 'harsh' the statement was and that you should have said it in a gentler way since you know of the issues she is facing and that she isn't in a great spot.", "Exactly.

I agree with many others saying that just because there is 1 single person on the trip doesn\u2019t mean that they have to be the one catered to.
