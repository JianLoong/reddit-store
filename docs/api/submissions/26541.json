Maybe she wanted comfort and reassurance and a reminder that just because it SEEMS like she's the only person struggling, she's doing a lot of things right.

This was a good method of sending a message along those lines. \n\nI am absolutely not suggesting you force couples not to be affectionate over the weekend, or that you listen to her say whatever wild shit she wants without pushback. However, there are ways of being able to validate people emotionally without giving ground in a logistical sense. \n\nYou can let her know that it's really upsetting and offensive to hear after the fact about something horrible people were apparently doing, without any warning or attempt to calibrate her feelings to reality. It can also be really hard to hear all the ugly mad self-loathing thoughts a loved one has, because of course we want to help them make it better, make it hurt less, but this is a situation where she can't really be talked down into less drama, or granted her wishes for next time. If you lay it out like that\u2014that you love her, but right now you're IN the situation she completely hates and have other people you love doing the things that cause her pain\u2014she might be able to agree to stop leaving these emotional bags of flaming poop on your doorstep when you're just tired and want to go home, and complain to someone who doesn't have to validate her feelings while also juggling 15 other considerations the whole time. \n\nIt sucks! It's gonna be hard! When I did my own stuff like this with my mother, I finally dragged us to a relationship counsellor, because we each have different approaches to life and trauma-informed pasts that make talking about stuff this intense really difficult because we really quickly get overwhelmed and stop listening to each other. \n\nI suspect right now she is really aching for connection, but also angry and a little paranoid and waiting for it to blow up into a fight.

I highly recommend therapy. But sometimes you need to be brutally honest. For her to find that happiness with someone else, she needs to find happiness within herself.

She may even be actually depressed and frozen - unable to see why she has such \"bad luck\" in relationships.

Not everyone wants to do the same thing, this way people can do what they want and meet up so it's still at times the entire family.", "It's sounds to me more like a trip where everyone meets up for family activities but also spends time doing their own things. \n\nI've absolutely been on trips where we all meet for dinner or an activity but aren't necessarily attached to each other otherwise. I'd be far less likely to go on vacations where I am essentially stuck with family and such the entire time.\n\nIt also helps when there are different age groups, etc. I am willing to go off path and hike down a shitty mountainside to get to the waterfall. Most of my family? Nope. Some people want fancy restaurants, while others will only eat at Cracker Barrell and such.  Being family doesn't mean you want identical vacations.", "We did family things in the morning and afternoon. It was at night where we were splitting up.", "Ummm.. what? You think when everyone was planning this trip that a 27 year old adult couldn\u2019t have understood the plan? \n\nShe\u2019s an adult.

My friends have always been very welcoming, because they know that I\u2019d like to have a partner, but just don\u2019t seem likely to find one. Why rub salt in wounds? I used to live with my best friend, and adore her boyfriend, and while I made sure to not interject myself too much, they would often spend time with me, or share food with me when they cooked. I think it made everyone\u2019s lives better. Since I felt so loved, I acted in ways that made their lives better too, like never complaining that her Bf was there all the time, because I was so happy to see him too! It also seems like OP complains about her daughters poor relationships, but then makes her feel \u201cless than\u201d for not having a partner, perhaps pushing her into bad relationships, where my friends support has allowed me to be happily single, rather than unhappily partnered\u2026", "When everyone is a couple except one person, inevitably there will be couple activities.

And, yeah, it\u2019s never the victim\u2019s fault. No one deserves abuse. But there\u2019s a reason why some people, MYSELF INCLUDED, fall into abusive relationships over and over. We tend to be bad at setting and maintaining boundaries. We back down in confrontations. We\u2019re always the first to apologize, even when we were right. We bend over backwards to make the people we care about as happy and stress-free as we can. These qualities aren\u2019t necessarily bad if you find the right person to be with, I\u2019d even argue that, in a healthy relationship, they can be a good thing! But they are also a MAGNET to abusers. I didn\u2019t manage to have a truly healthy relationship until I realized that I was the common denominator.

It likely has more to do with her father more than anything acctually.\n\nwow. some of ya'll really need to reign yourselves in. wtf.", "Is it fair to blame the father? Her siblings seem to be doing ok after all", "Plenty of \"the best women\" are waiting to get married as well.  27 isn't spinster age, dude.", "Couples time was apparently in the evenings. That's not really peak \"explore on your own\" time imo!", "This. Invite people, spend time with them, make memories.

It's harder to find things to do, it's not always safe to be out and about in your own at night, and it can be peak loneliness time as well. The whole experience sounds pretty wretched, especially since even her own mother doesn't have any empathy for her unhappiness.", "I\u2019m not sure I believe that no one made an effort to spend time with her. OP says that they did things as a whole family, or sometimes she was a third wheel. And the daughter said people were affectionate in front of her. All of these things say that she didn\u2019t spend the whole time alone.", "Agreed, I can\u2019t think of a single family vacation from either my side of the family or my husband\u2019s where we split up on a trip and left someone out or made them third wheel. I would feel weird doing that to the people I love who are single.\n\nIdk why this is getting downvoted. OP said almost every night they all split up, it wasn\u2019t an occasional \u201coh we want to do this real quick\u201d it was consistent and veered away from a family trip and into a couples trip", "Splitting off into different activities is normal, splitting off into coupled date nights every night (from OP's comments) is less so!", "You mean you didn't... have dinner as a family? Watch movies in the evening as a family? Do... family stuff in the evening?  \n\n\nIt sounds like a trip that would make any lone-single person feel like they don't belong. If I was her, I wouldn't want to keep doing \"family\" vacations with you lot. You sound more like a couples' club than anything else.", "And what was she doing alone at night by herself? Probably sitting in her room? That stinks. I was the chronically single friend/family member for a while before meeting my husband. Being around couples all of the time was exhausting, and only made me feel more lonely. So I can sympathize with your daughter. The only person I felt comfortable venting/complaining to about it was my mom. Because I knew she\u2019d support me no matter what. I also had no one else in my life to support me, as that  usually comes from a partner. Your daughter is sharing her true and vulnerable  emotions with you. I do disagree with her expecting for people to never show affection to their partners around her though. Seems unrealistic.\n\nEdit to add: I also understand that your daughter isn\u2019t single, her boyfriend just wasn\u2019t present. But as you said \u201cher relationship is toxic\u201d so I\u2019m assuming she isn\u2019t getting any emotional support from her bf. Which is why she most likely came to you for it.", "Ya'll couldn't take turns inviting her? The no affection thing is bogus but the consistent every day/night breaking off into couples is weird.", "You all planned every single night for it to be couples time?  Did she know that ahead of time??  If you knew it then why didn\u2019t you encourage her to bring a friend along?  If it was once it would be different, but every night?!?  YTA. \n\nHer wanting people not to show affection, though, is OTT", "Yeah I gotta say that\u2019s weird if y\u2019all did that every night or most nights\n\nEdit to add: family trips are just that. *family* trips. They\u2019re not trips to have multiple couple dates. Unless y\u2019all planned ahead & announced this ahead of time (& again, to have most or all nights set apart for couple dates or whatever on a family trip IS weird), then yeah, your daughter isn\u2019t just complaining over something silly. She\u2019s specifically being excluded by her family on a family trip.", "As someone who goes on vacation alone, it's the nights that are the worst. What do you do at night when you're with someone, whether they be friend, family or partner? You chat, have a drink, something to eat. It's a wonderful time.  \n\n\nWhat happens if you're alone? Everyone is out doing fun things and all that's left to do for you is read a book, watch tv, go on the internet etc. Nights alone are decidedly less fun.", "I get what you\u2019re saying, but it was a *family* vacation not a *couples* trip. I personally find that there is a distinct difference", "No one\u2019s saying that they can\u2019t do couple things on a family trip, just that it\u2019s shitty to all do it every night on a family trip. They could have made an effort to make sure that not every couple goes to do couple activities at the same time or if they do, it isn\u2019t every night (like 2x through a 1 week trip).", "Same", "Honestly you can\u2019t control ppls bad actions but you can control walking away.

Or could be the youngest and they weren't as attentive because they were too focused on 'new' stuff with their older siblings. Or could be the ignored middle child.\n\nOr could be the other siblings were naturally smarter and more outgoing so they got more attention and positive reinforcement from the parents.\n\nThere's many indirect and innocent ways parenting can cause this.\n\nThe daughter in this case has most likely had a lack of attention from the parents. Usually in toxic relationships, the abuser/cheater shows a lot of affection making their partner feel noticed and wanted. And that's what they crave, due to a lack of it during their upbringing, and seeing their siblings get it.\n\nCould also be a disorder causing it, or just interests at school forcing a social circle in a more rebellious demographic, or many other reasons outside of the parents control however.", "Point taken. But coming across as judgmental in this context  makes OP TAH.  And who\u2019s smoking what? I missed that.", "Oh I didn\u2019t mean to imply I thought she spent the whole time alone, but I realize that was poor phrasing. I do think it\u2019s the polite thing to do, on a family vacation, to make sure nobody\u2019s left out if the group is breaking up into smaller groups (regardless of if it\u2019s couples or not). So what I should\u2019ve said was, I think it sucks that people didn\u2019t invite her along on their couple activities and actively include her. The fact that the mom admits she was a 3rd wheel is what makes me think more effort could\u2019ve been made\u2014there are *definitely* ways for a couple to hang with single friends without any 3rd-wheeling necessary. \n\nObviously the complaint about people showing affection is ridiculous and immature. But two things can be true at one time", "Yeah, we always do things together or maybe in two or three groups depending on who wants to do what. But no one is left alone unless they decide they want it that way (and usually with people trying to convince them to join in anyway\u2026). A couple would go do their own thing sometimes, but not everyone at once.", "We have dinner, yes. Though my family seems to eat dinner earlier than most people I know.\nIts when it was dark out that was mainly the couples times", "I don\u2019t know. I feel like everyone needs to be comfortable doing things by themselves. One of the reasons people get stuck in bad relationships in the first place is because they are afraid to be alone. Personally, I would welcome evenings to myself on a family vacation with a lot of people.", "I\u2019m trying to think from your perspective and it makes sense with minor children with limited independence but not adult children. I\u2019m trying to imagine me as a 27 year old going on a family vacation with my parents and wanting to hang out with them the whole time. I would expect to spend some time with them and then do other activities either by myself or with other family member my own age. At 27, OP\u2019s daughter is perfectly capable of finding something to do by herself.", "there is nothing i would find more draining than spending every waking second on a trip doing family activities. just because its a family trip doesn't mean every activity needs to be a family activity", "What is it? I though a male at birth too lol", "If this is a recent story, so by after dark we're talking... the group split up at 8pm or so, I would say that sounds reasonable. But if you guys are having dinner at 3 or 4 in the afternoon and then splitting up for the day, I urge you to consider what the family dynamic would look like if the majority of you were single.  \n\n\nShe was going over the top saying people shouldn't show affection around her, but it does sound like your group dynamic has become rather careless of the experiences of the unattached, now that your own children are no longer children.", "If OP said that to her daughter that would be good advice. Instead she was reprimanded for sharing her feelings", "This is fair in every day circumstances. But I wouldn\u2019t be super comfortable alone at night while in a foreign place. Obviously other than bedtime in my hotel room.", "I agree with this. I AM 27 and if I went on a big family vacation and my bf went with me, one fully funded by us (aka using our expenses and PTO, etc) I\u2019d like to take one or two nights (depending on length of stay) as a little romantic date night etc. take advantage of this likely now being our yearly travel.", "I agree that I would expect them to do other activities occasionally. But after OP added more detail/explanation in the comments that they were apparently using every or almost every evening for every couple to go off by themselves? That\u2019s different than just \u201cwanting to hang out with them the whole time.\u201d I recommend you rethink your initial perspective based on the additional information provided in the comments, which is what I did, bc I certainly shared your perspective in my initial reading. But my comment was specifically responding to a comment where the OP indicated every evening was individual couple time, which is very different than just occasionally needing alone/couple time!", "I once again beg you/others to actually read my comment and his", "That\u2019s a good point. I wonder how much pressure OP puts on her daughter to be in a relationship to begin with.", "just because I disagree with you, doesn't mean I didn't read your comment. I did. my point stands.", "Exactly my thought.  Complaining that \"My nieces and nephews, along with my other kids are all happily married\" indicates she expected her daughter to be married off by now.  27 is still very young and perfectly fine to not be \"settled down\" yet."]}
