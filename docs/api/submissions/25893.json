When we bought our house from her parents and they wanted us to let their other son (my brother in law) and his wife, 3, kids and dog live with us. They sold us the house at a reduced price for this condition. I signed a contract. I had every intention of keeping my promise but I\u2019ve been living with them for a few months and it is hell. They don\u2019t clean up anything. They are total slobs with food, dirty cloths, and kids toys. It\u2019s all everywhere and it smells in the house. Their dog especially. They don\u2019t pick up after their dog. He pees on things in the house and they ignore it. Our back yard has dog poop everywhere. They don\u2019t disciple their kids at all. They scream from first thing in the morning to late at night and you can\u2019t say a thing or he\u2019ll get mad. Their youngest kid they say is potty trained but from all the pee and poop I\u2019ve had to clean up I can tell you that is a lie. I had to go out and buy diapers for him so I would have to clean it up in the house. They don\u2019t change him. They don\u2019t pay for anything, I\u2019ll buy groceries and his kids will devour them on the first day. They are destructive but when I try to talk to my brother in law he turns into kind of a bully. I tried to talk to my wife but she defends him and says this is what I agreed too and her family would never forgive me. She loves having them in the house but I don\u2019t get it. We just found out she\u2019s pregnant and so is her brothers wife. I really don\u2019t know what to do at this point I\u2019ve sunken my savings into this house and they have no money so there not going anywhere. I work from home and those kids are animals. I know it\u2019s wrong to say but I hate them.

You won\u2019t want to hear this, but I don\u2019t think you CAN make them leave, especially if your wife loves having them there.

Don\u2019t stay in this toxic situation just because you\u2019ve already put a lot of resources into it. Move out. Get your own apartment. It\u2019s the only way you\u2019ll be able to get away from these people. I don\u2019t know if you will have the ability to forcibly remove them. They may have squatters rights. Moreover, if your wife\u2019s name is on the deed and she wants them to be there, you\u2019re doubly screwed. Just leave.", "Dude be legit, and sell the home, don't rush it, sell it for its value. And give the brother his half or just the profit accordingly. And call it a day. No excuses. That or you can talk to them and work it out. But it is partly sounding like you found a way to get a discount on a home and were prepared to look for every and any excuse if it didn't go your way perfectly.  Maybe that's not the case and maybe its significantly worse than what you describe, but it does sound like its a good chance, because what you're explaining sounds exactly what was agreed upon, living with a A FREAKING FAMILY.\n\nI'm sure many people here will take your side, because there is a lot of thoughtless pride that goes with keeping things clean and a lot of neuroticism but to the degree you guys take it a lot of the time is not right.\n\nLike just talk to him with some force and like sell him on how it will make his kids more responsible ect. Like for once you people try to work someone rather than saying how they're not human and I am, and the proof I have is that he is dirty. Like being clean is functional not pride dude, it's such a red flag when people go there and aren't actually trying to work the person. It's become like weaponized by insecure people, and then the rest are just unabashedly neurotic. Like there's other issues involved if you can't take your home not looking like an Ikea ad 24/7, just a side rant. Like the interviewer question is do you keep things organizined, and can you keep your ish together if unorganized. Its not just do you keep it organized.\n\nBut yeah, hopefully, the parents wrote in the contract that you can't throw them out. Sounds like you just don't like them in general, and are mad that your wife does? Red flags, everywhere. Not going to say that I know forsure but people here are going to act like your family is the bad guy, and they're going to say that its forsure, and I can say with certainty that they're wrong. I will say that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

They were there when your inlaws sold you the house. You can not control their behavior- but you can control your own. Buy a fridge for your food and lock it. Pee, poop, messes?

They are disgusting slobs but you will be the asshole if you kick them out due to the previous agreement.

As others here have said you may want to consult a lawyer to see if there are any loopholes. Maybe your wife to speak to your parents to see if they would lift that condition in return for you putting more money in over a long period or some other compromise, generally trying to negotiate will work better than lawyers.", "Maybe the least you can do mean time it is try to separate out the spaces in the house so they can live in their own s*** rather than have you pick it up, make the dog an outside dog with a kennel if it's not going to be house trained, and get a lock for your fridge and pantry! They can at least buy their own groceries SMH."]}
