Like for once you people try to work someone rather than saying how they're not human and I am, and the proof I have is that he is dirty. Like being clean is functional not pride dude, it's such a red flag when people go there and aren't actually trying to work the person. It's become like weaponized by insecure people, and then the rest are just unabashedly neurotic. Like there's other issues involved if you can't take your home not looking like an Ikea ad 24/7, just a side rant.

Its not just do you keep it organized.\n\nBut yeah, hopefully, the parents wrote in the contract that you can't throw them out.

Let's see if after coming home to a house: full of pee and poo both animal and human, leftovers, toys and clothes everywhere, and no one else to help clean up she still loves having those people around. I highly doubt she likes living like a pig, but if it turns out she does like it then you have a bigger issue. Also you need to set a firm boundary with your budget you and your wife shouldn't be supporting a family of five about to become six, specially when you are expecting your own child if your wife wants to do it then you'll have to separate your finances you can't risk you and your kid stability because brother in law and wife refuse to be responsible for their own family \n\nI sincerely hope you can find a way out of his situation.", "NTA for wanting them gone but it's never going to happen.

Sorry that she's already pregnant.\n\nHow much of a break did you get for this house? How the hell were you sold on this? Do you have an office that you can sleep in/put your food in?

Sounds like they're testing him a bit, but he has been prepping his excuses at the same. The food thing is a little bizarre. A situation where you present it to weaponize it later. Just tell them to buy their own food. \n\nMom is an eviction attorney, evictors are surprisingly just as bad, people have zero respect for contracts  or regard for others and some are insanely picky about their living spaces, and if it doesn't work perfect for them they will go to the nth degree picking apart everything, exaggerating everything. Like people will absolutely lose all ethics for their living spaces. So yeah it's hard to trust anything they say. It's why the laws have to be so crazy and are so abused.\n\nI do know he hit a lot of the key points for the loud majority on the internet, who most people are very afraid to fight because it is so embarrassing to be dirty. Say someone its dirty and its off with their heads. I know that's the forsure going to be the take here. And forsure a lot of people will help him and justify it. Being lazy, another great point to use on the internet. \n\nIts just not right, there's a slim chance they're actually socios, I'm guessing its the house they grew up in and they're keeping their same habits and maybe they need to be considerate of him playing a part now, forsure. The mom and dad sound like they loved their family, the sister loves her brother. Maybe he just feels like he deserves that respect. But you guys instead are going to tell him to get an attorney and kick them out of the house. It's just messed up, sorry for saying otherwise. It could be as I said, that he had no intention of living with them unless it fit his needs perfectly and was hoping his wife would be on the same page. And now could absolutely ruin a family. Like there's more at play than dog crap. And you guys don't care, it's just another point for your ego. There's not going to be any comments on how to work his brothers in laws ego or try and get him to see why being clean is so good. And just how to all take their egos and make it work. Not to bring them down, so you can go up. \n\nLike dude it's just so messed up I don't know what I'm arguing, he can't take their house. He should have been 100. He should have investigated 100. So that instead his parents could just sell the house and split the profits for them. \n\nBut yeah, I don't even get your comment, I pretty much said myself in the first, that none of us know the truth.

I mean even if he does try and fix it, and it doesn't work he can talk to the parents, get his money back, start at square one, sell the house ect. The dude is calling this family toxic and hasn't even seen them for one minute. They don't know the situation, Op sounds potentially just as bad. It's just two different sides right that don't mesh.

I just don't understand the purpose of theorizing that the OP is exaggerating or lying about everything and that his BIL's family are perfect housemates.

But I don't want to go down that tangent, like it's just how you guys operate, look at your recent response. \n\nDude, all I said, is that commenters will obviously destroy this family (which came true, fact). And then I admitted that everything I said was an assumption, I think that's the only reason you brought it up? Because I did? Like other people are making comments on here that these people deserve to lose their home. Why aren't you then going after them? They're saying it as fact. Why did you come after me? Because you see yourself being apart of the group I insulted and who I told the guy wouldn't be able to give an unbiased answer. You took offense to it and attacked. Everything is about you guys, even your answers. I am so sick of it, it's destroying the world. Like you just have to pray that it doesn't take over this entire new generation dude. And we continue to put the right people in the right jobs. Like I can say for certain no judge right now is kicking the family out because dog poop isn't picked up every single day. \n\nWhat I said in the comment has totally become true, look at all the responses he's getting. That's the only thing I said that was for certain, that you hit a lot of the points that people have proven to love online, that really make them feel good to say that they don't do, and that he was obviously going to get replies accordingly. And that's the only thing I said with certainty that they're wrong to tell you to kick these guys out. You guys are wrong for saying that family deserves to lose their home.\n\nAnd the only thing I truly made an assumption was the discount, which is actually irrelevant, though I admit it does play a huge part. Like he knows he has no foot to stand on if he says he got it 90% off. No foot with anyone. And I assume it was a fat discount additionally because Id assume he'd be much more careful if it wasn't. Sounds like the family was living there already. Had he not been to the house? Like these are some intricacies I'm sure he would have covered if it weren't that great of a price. Like are the kids loud, do dogs smell. I admit it does seem like a situation, where it was great wow, we'll see how it goes. Not like hey dude listen, we'll give you 15 off, all you have to do is let everyone still live with you. Great right?", "Ok, he should stop paying for the house, save the money until they\u2019re all evicted, and then use it to rent something brother\u2019s family won\u2019t fit in. Or to move across country. Anything. He can drag his brother-loving wife along. Poor kid.", "I didn't come after you! I was trying to figure out why you came to your assumptions. I'm using my words, not insulting you. And who are \"you guys\"? \n\nBut don't worry, it's all very clear to me now! Have a good night!", "Divorce and file bankruptcy.", "You allowed to sell the house?\n\nMy advice is to tell you to man up and tell your wife you absolutely cannot continue to live with her siblings and that you'll do anything to get out of this living situation, and that includes divorce. \n\nIf the situation is that bad, you have to be prepared to walk away from it all.\n\nIf your wife won't put you and your family first then your going to have to for yourself."]}
