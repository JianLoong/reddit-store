And have you said 'no'?", "INFO - What have you done for the last few Christmases? Is this your first time hosting in a while or do you host every year? \n\nHere's my thoughts about Christmas.  Christmas dinner is a pain in the butt, but it's a cornerstone of Christmas.  It is part of what makes Christmas special.  I've had a few non traditional Christmases, and they were lovely, but it wasn't Christmas.  That's why most families take it in turn to host, so that the work of cooking a Christmas dinner doesn't fall on the same person each year.  So unless you have hosted for a few years running, there's not really a reason for them to host you rather than the other way round. You can ask them, they can oblige, but there isn't a \"wealthiest/most free time people host\"\n\nThe \"expectations\" your in-laws have sound like the pretty standard stuff that comes with hosting Christmas - food, drinks and general fun times. \n\nHowever, you are also under no obligation of spending Christmas with your in-laws. If your life feels way too overwhelming, you can turn around to them and say \"sorry guys, not this year we're just too overwhelmed\".  You can ask to be hosted by them.  Or you can offer to go for a curry. But for me, if you haven't hosted Christmas for a while, a curry is a cop-out. Especially because I get the sense you don't really want to spend Christmas with them in the first place. \n\nI'm conflicted about this.  I guess if your in-law's have hosted you for the last few Christmasses with all the trimmings - then Y T A but if this is a random \"we're coming to you, put on a spread\" after not having done anything together for years then N T A", "I\u2019ve done dinners on Christmas Day, it takes away from time I can spend with my children, it\u2019s bring and share time, in my house everyone brings a dish or dishes we do a buffet and everyone can relax and have fun.

I'm afraid that won't work for us with our time and budget issues, so either you could come here at date/time X and I'll cook a curry, or we could come over to yours and we'll bring desert.\"", "NTA\n\nBut you also don't owe them a detailed explanation.\n\n\"It doesn't work for us this year\" is all you ever need to tell them and repeat as necessary. \"We can't make this happen.\" Be firm, let *them* figure out what they are going to do instead.", "NTA. Speak up. \"I do not have the capacity to host/cook this year. Let's brainstorm another solution instead.\"", "Just say no. If your husband doesn't back you up, do not do anything more than what you need to do for the kids. No booze, no cheeses, small turkey, no prepping etc. Just look after the kids.  They sound awful in laws.", "Isn\u2019t there a migraine you need to have on Christmas Eve? Covid?

If so, he should let parents know that your family will not be doing an elaborate Christmas. Invite them for Christmas Day.\n\nWhy can't your husband ask to come to their house? \n\nFor dinner, there really is no reason to drive yourself crazy making elaborate foods and cooking all day. When my parents retired and moved to the West Coast when I had moved, I would go to them for Thanksgiving but it was a very simple dinner - roast turkey, green vegetable; sweet potato, stuffing and a pie from one of the very good bakeries. It really was not very different from any other meal she would cook as we had grown up with home cooked meals with protein; green vegetable and a carb side being normal. \n\nMy mother actually found Thanksgiving dinner easy because she didn't have to worry about a fancy menu and complicated dishes as she might for a dinner party.", "NTA. Tell them now that you can't host Christmas dinner. They're not required to invite you, either, but you can say \"we can't host this year, but if you're hosting, we'd be happy to come to your house and could bring a dessert. Otherwise, we're just going to have a low-key celebration at home by ourselves this year.\" The more reasons you give for why you can't host, the more you open yourself up to negotiations and argument about your decision. Why can't you? \"We just can't this year, maybe another year!\"", "Nta I think you should be invited to their house.", "Tell them you will be serving curry, bet they decide not to rock up and grift dinner from you. They clearly don't know or don't care you are broke.", "NTA\nYour boundaries control your choices about where you spend your limited time, energy and resources. You don't have the energy nor resources to host on the holidays. Say that. \"No. That doesn't work for me.\" Being self aware, self accepting and self supportive is healthy. It's NOT the bad kind of \"selfish.\"\n\nThe bad kind of selfish is being entitled and demanding that others inconvenience themselves to satisfy your wants. Like inviting yourself to a dinner party hosted by relatives who haven't offered and don't want to do it.\n\nYou and your husband should plan holidays that suit your needs and your children's. Extended family can be worked in AROUND your family's plans. You could visit your in-laws the day before or after, or arrange for them to come over for a couple hours. Not a special meal and party. A drop by to see the kids enjoying the holiday kind of visit.\n\nStop acquiesing to do things planned without you and presented as \"your job.\" Be aware of FOG, fear, obligation and guilt, the long distance tools of manipulation. When you feel pressure to do something you really don't want to, examine the thoughts and feelings behind that. If your only motivation to do the unwanted thing is FOG, don't do it. Don't get into lengthy arguments and explanations. Decide on your boundary, ideally mutually with your spouse. Then communicate it in clear and simple language. \"We want to see you during the holiday period, but hosting a party is beyond us.\" Don't entertain \"compromises\" where you do the unwanted thing and the demanders make no efforts. Scaling back their demands is not their making an effort.

Now OP needs cheese, snacks, and enough alcohol for a rich relative to get drunk, plus sufficient food for 2 whole extra adults.  Are we still talking about a meal that's cheaper than curry for just OP's family alone?", "This is great!", "There's no compromise available in \"I don't want to host\" versus \"my inlaws expect me to host.\"  Hosting is yes/no, 1 or 0, there's no in between where there is room for compromise.  There is either \"I get what I want\" or \"I get railroaded.\"\n\nYour advice is fine for people who find themselves unable to say no and get railroaded, but don't frame that as a compromise.  A compromise is \"I get some of what I want and you get some what of what you want, and neither of us get 100% of what we want\".\n\nI also really question your framing of OP as male.  It's not generally pushed onto men to do all-day cooking against their will.", "Thanks. I find it both petty and lazy. Have a great Christmas \ud83d\ude18", "Nah that's not how marriages work.\n\nClassic Reddit conversation this.\n\nEdit: OP has said elsewhere he's a guy."]}
