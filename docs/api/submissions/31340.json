Perhaps you should do without them.", "NTA for not wanting to host.\nTalk to your partner.

Could only stand for 15 min of every hour for 3-4 days. I made lasagna because I could fit the steps into that window of time and a new tradition was born.

You've got 3 kids and you've had 5 years to get used to looking after them whilst doing other stuff. It's hard but billions of people manage it. So it's not about whether you've got kids or not, it's about whether they always expect you to do this or if it's just a one off thing. What does your spouse think about this and are they helping with the dinner? Perhaps they can make the Christmas dinner while you look after the kids?", "NTA.

Tell them if they want to eat at your house. they must make a potluck.\n\nSince the death of my parents, my sisters and me take turns to host the christmas family meetings. The hostess prepares one main dish, and everybody (including the adult daughters and sons) brings something - snacks, dessert, side dishes, bread, drinks. It works very well for all of us.", "INFO\n\nWho usually cooks Christmas dinner? Do you normally have a dinner at all? You said you rather go out and have more time with your kids - is that something you normally do?\n\nOr do you normally go to your in-laws and they\u2019re asking you to host for a change", "INFO: How do you know that your inlaws expect all of this. Have you had a conversation about this or is this just what has always happened and no one has ever discussed alternatives? Also, where does your partner stand on all of this since it's their parents?\n\nIf you haven't discussed it with the inlaws then a conversation might be in order. They may not actually care if you get a takeaway and just spend time together.", "It's been a long time since mine were that young but from memory most parents of young kids prefer to host so that they don't need to go out and deal with the endless drama of getting kids in the car, getting kids settled, keeping kids entertained, trying to wrangle overtired kids back into the car seat etc. \n\nIf you don't want to host you can always just nicely say that but if you have no money how are you planning to pay for dinner out plus you will still need to bring something to your in laws plus travel time and wrangling your children. Christmas is just expensive and a lot of effort when you have young children, I always found hosting easier that transporting my mini monster to family homes and cheaper than going out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Couple years ago we just ordered pizza since our normal place had closed during COVID. Simple easy everyone was happy. There is a reason we keep it to just  immediate family on day of. It so we have time to spend with each others yes we have a home cooked dinner but with just 6 of us it\u2019s not too much. No cheese and crackers or a or any pre meals nibbles needed. Christmas cookies made the day before for dessert. Only elaborate things f is the roast beef but potatoes and green beans and rolls are pretty easy.", "NTA\nTell husband you don't think you can do it. No wonder. This is preparing an elaborate dinner, preparing for overnight guests, while still doing Christmas prep and all that entails. There's also the issue of money\n\nYou guys need to brainstorm options and husband needs to tell his parents that current plans are changed.  Can it be cancelled? Can they stay in a hotel?

But alot of families have Christmas hosted at a different house each year.\n\nSo for example it might have been at the inlaws last year and now it's her turn.\n\nIf you aren't happy with this agreement you need to make that known straight away and not just when it's your turn", "This is great advice. Specifically the wine and cheese part. OP, do this!", "> It's a full day job\n\nI think you should say \"no\", but for what it's worth, for the future years... it doesn't have to be. Cook something simple. Or let M&S do it, and just reheat (OK so that's not such a good solution if you're broke). Make a new tradition: Curry! I think your curry idea was sound. One year we went for pizza, nobody complained.", "If you do have to cook, try and prep as much of it the day before. Shaves a couple of hours off the actual cooking on Christmas Day.. no shame in serving up reheated meat (assuming it's not turkey/chicken). Getting all the veg chopped and ready to just throw in the pan helps too. Granted I don't have to do that with three wee kids tearing about demanding attention.", "yes!  and anyone who gives you a hard time because you are too poor or too busy is not someone you need in your life anyway", "That misses the point: OP does not want to host. Which is fine.", "You can prepare all vegetables and leave them in a pan of salted water, ready to go, the day before. \n\nPotatoes need to be completely under water to exclude air. If its a vegetable that discolours a drop of lemon juice helps.\n\nGet a big chicken in a roasting bag. Virtually no work, apart from opening the bag to let it crisp up.", "Aye I'm just saying if he gets guilt tripped/emotionally blackmailed into it (as is often the way on special occasions in marriages) then it's a wee tip to avoid having to do so much on the actual day itself.", "Aye this is pretty much what we do on the years we cook. Usually do a big gammon joint that we roast the day before and then reheat on Christmas Day.\n\nAll that's left is the Pigs in Blankets and Yorkshire Puddings after that.", "That's no solution.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nfocusing on refusing to host when OP does not want to host is the better solution.", "We don't always get what we want.
