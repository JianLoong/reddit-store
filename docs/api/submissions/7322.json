They've both been single ever since, barring like two short relationships each. We still spent Christmas together as a family and they were still very good friends.\n\nOn this past Christmas, however, I found out they had been dating eachother for the past year and a bit because my dad asked her to marry him again after dinner (she said yes). I knew they were both in relationships and at one point I did suspect that they were dating eachother because I found my dad's jacket in the bathroom at my mom's house but she insisted that he had been over to check the boiler and the story checked out when I went to give him his jacket back. I was a little irritated at being blindsided at Christmas but I understood they wanted to keep their relationship a secret in case it didn't work out.\n\nWhat I'm annoyed about now is how they're trying to pretend they never split up and how they're planning their wedding. My dad bought me a new laptop because the one I had before was a gift from my mom's ex-boyfriend and he insisted that I transfer all my files and data. When I took too long to do it, he did it himself. He did it well and I didn't lose anything, but I found it weird. My mom also threw away some jewelry that my dad's ex-girlfriend bought me a few years back. She replaced them, gave me money to get more and apologized, but she said that she 'didn't want any proof' of them ever splitting. \n\nBesides replacing items, they're also trying to recreate their first wedding which is already going be a massive challenge because 1) it happened abroad 2) A lot of the guests at the first ones aren't alive anymore. My mom wants me to be her maid of honor and I'm so honored (hah) but she wants me to wear a similar dress and make up to her maid of honor in the first wedding. I guessed it won't be so bad but her old maid of honor was (and still is) my uncle's wife so I think it'll be weird. \n\n\nThey also want to move in together into my dad's house (their old marital home and my childhood home) which is far from my school. My dad promised to drive me to school everyday so I wouldn't have to get the bus or walk but I don't know. I've argued with them a lot about all this strangeness and it's resulted in tears, and them both insisting that everything has to be 'perfect' and eveyone will be much happier when things 'go back to how they were'.\n\nMy brother (17M) thinks I'm being unreasonable about being annoyed and oppositional to all of this. He's handling it find and so are my younger siblings so I'm starting to think that I'm only annoyed because I keep arguing with my parents and opposing everything. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673696088, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10bmfpe/aita_for_being_annoyed_at_my_parents/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They are trying to rewrite history and portray a happy family that has existed in perpetuity, and erase everything that happened in between. They think nobody will notice this? Almost like Emperor's new clothes! best to ignore them and be happy for them.", "You\u2019re allowed to feel the way you feel.  Erasing the past like it never happened doesn\u2019t feel good to you.  The past happened.  They divorced.  You moved out of your childhood home.  You had to go back and forth to both houses. You experienced a lot of emotions and made adjustments from the divorce.  You\u2019ve also grown up and changed. Pretending nothing happened is like invalidating your experiences.\n\nI would recommend talking to your parents calmly and explain how you feel.  At the end of the day, they are your parents and you need to comply with the living situation.  However, they need to understand just because THEY want to forget THEIR divorce didn\u2019t exist doesn\u2019t mean YOUR pain and experiences didn\u2019t.", "YNTA.  You simply are older and aware and see they are re-writing history without your input.  \n\nIdentical wedding. A waste of money.   \n\nYour dad replacing things from past boyfriend is weird.

You sound like you\u2019re the oldest (along with your twin) and given that you\u2019ve had to deal with the divorce growing up and getting used to that, now you\u2019re expected to act like it all never happened, I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019ve reacted the best way, but I wouldn\u2019t pin you as an AH.\n\nI also wouldn\u2019t say your parents are the AHs but they are definitely acting weird, pretending the divorce didn\u2019t even happen. Doesn\u2019t sound healthy. This marriage should be about a \u2018new beginning\u2019 rather than the same beginning. I\u2019d say try reasoning with them, and tell them how you feel.", "NTA\n\nYou have every right to be annoyed. Your parents divorce also affected you and now they want to pretend like it never happened. \nUnless they've overcome their differences and reasons as to why they got divorced in the first place and have gotten counceling, I think they are in a bit of denial and just want to ignore the issues from the past.\n\nBut it's their life and relationship and not much you can do but accept what's happening", "NTA they are erasing and rewriting the past to change reality. Having both a narcissist mother and older brother, they would do this a lot. Claim things never happened and destroyed and replaced evidence to say that it did.

At best, maybe you can successfully lobby for a car to take yourself to school.", "NTA\n\nWhile it's wonderful that they reconciled --- and, frankly, many children of divorced parents have prayed for just such an outcome --- it's a bit odd that they're literally trying to rewrite history so the intervening years never happened.\n\nThey can never go back to \"how things were\" but they can move forward, knowing they've reconciled.  \n\nI'd advise they get therapy to get to the bottom of **why** they are so desperately intent to pretend the intervening years didn't happen.  \n\nIt's like the book 1984, where the Ministry of Truth rewrites history constantly so The Party is never wrong.  Here, the desired goal is much more personal (\"the years of our separation never happened\") but it is just as dishonest.", "NTA and maybe tell them you don\u2019t want things to go back to how they were because that ended with a divorce.", "Oof NTA. You are super right that this is weird and it\u2019s not likely to go very well. Pretending you never had problems is not the same as dealing with them. Expect this to blow up again in 3-5 years. But you\u2019ve said your piece, you\u2019re not going to convince them and if you keep it up they\u2019re going to start accusing you of sabotaging their happiness. You\u2019re almost an adult and one of the skills of being adult is knowing that sometimes you have to shut up and watch the people you love make really obviously bad decisions and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it.

Whether they like that or not, it is the fact that can\u2019t be changed. They can make believe and pretend but you (and everyone else) know the truth. \n\nImo they need to act maturely and start from fresh to deal with their issues.

We can\u2019t pretend the wedding is just about the couple. The children are affected too.", "Are they erasing it or leaving the past where it needs to be, in the past. Can't move forward while constantly dwelling in the past. Life  doesn't stop because you had a past. It's going to go on whether you want it to or not.  Could they have a talk with the daughter?

If the parents are throwing away stuff given to them, it's not any of her concern.\n\nJust say you want the parents to be stuck where they are in life. That's a sad life to live when you can't move forward because you keep reliving what's been done and gone for years. I get it, some people love misery and generally want others to wallow in it with them. Good for the ops parents. They are trying to move forward. Be happy for them or don't but they are going to do what they are going to do. Op can sit and wallow or move forward.", "OP mentioned a laptop & jewelry that were given to OP, nothing else.\n\nETA: OPs mom said they did this because they didn't want proof they were split up.
