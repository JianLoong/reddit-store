SIL and I have never had the best relationship. When I first met her and the rest of my ILs, the first question she had for me is why did my parents pick such a terrible name for me. My name is Oc\u00e9ane and my dad is French American and both he and my mom loved nature names so I got a French one. The name has never been such a big issue for anyone before and I never faced a rude comment like SILs before. My husband (then boyfriend) told her at the time she was being rude, and her parents told her to watch what she was saying. But my name has been a sticking point for her for years. She always asks what my parents were thinking or tells people I was bullied for my name, when I was not. Recently she started complaining about her son's friends having weird names (Hollis, Indie, Kyson, to name a few). Then last weekend we were all gathered and she asked BIL (husband and her's brother) and his wife what they were going to name their first child and SIL made a point of saying thank god it was a normal name unlike mine. I told her I hoped she'd learn to shut up about names around her son's friends since she can't seem to do it around me. Most people at the table laughed. SIL was pissed and her husband told me I was acting like she was a bully who'd do that to kids and it was unfair, that I'm an adult and should be able to handle it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1679742399, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121iiri/aita_for_telling_my_sil_i_hope_she_leans_how_to/", "score": 66, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
