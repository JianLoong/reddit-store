I own a red suit that besides the fact that is a close color and ALSO A SUIT, is nothing like her suit. Also, I'm a woman in my fifties with very a different body complexion than her.

I explained it's a suit that fits me nicely, was appropriate for the even and that my daughter had no problem with it. SIL said it's like wearing white to a wedding. It's about the dresscode. I disagreed, considering it was rather a familiar encounter, there was no one in there that me or my daughter needed to \"impress\" and I still don't see a problem.

I can still wear clothing I owned 25 years ago. But, no one is going to mistake me for trying to be 25. C'mon! Its just not ever gonna happen like that. But anybody who thinks I can't rock a red suit with the best of them is also being absurd. It wasn't like wearing white to a wedding.
