{"id": 21942, "submission_id": "14wt4e6", "title": "AITA for refusing to cook at my SILs because I'm the guest in the house?", "selftext": "My husband, myself and our 2 sons went to visit SIL for the 4 nights. We do this once a year (we live in separate states) and usually other family members come as well but this year it's just us. I'm 32 weeks pregnant so the travel was a bit rough on me anyways (we drove because I can't fly and it's 21 hours). \n\nWell, SIL had to work for 3 of the days that we were there and on those days, she would come home at 4pm, look at me and say \"so what are you cooking tonight?\" The first two times she said it I just laughed it off and so did she so I thought she was joking but she apparently wasn't (we purchased food everytime we come here as well- so we spent $300 on food for our stay). And for context, the guys were out fishing and stuff so they weren't home to cook or my husband absolutely would have (he loves grilling). The 3rd time she asked I just didn't say anything or laugh because it was getting kind of old. But she then looks at me and says \"it's the least you can do considering I worked all day while you sat here doing nothing\". Which is utter bullshit because I was left at the house with her kids AND my kids all day because this was a shift she picked up after we got here and her husband/my husband had already left for the day before she took off for her random shift that she didn't tell anyone about. \n\nI tell her at this point that I had taken care of 7 fucking kids all day, at 32 weeks pregnant, when I'm supposed to be a guest in her home and shouldn't be made to do anything anyways. I made this comment because she asked me to do a load of her laundry and do up the dishes when she was at work; which I did, no question. She just got irritated with me and walked off, mumbling under her breath, so I took my kids and left to go get take out for us and texted my husband giving him the rundown. He immediately came back home and was playing mediator but told his sister that she shouldn't have expected me to pick up house chores, babysit and cook dinner when I'm pregnant and a guest here. Needless to say we left a day early. But people are saying I'm ridiculous because it \"wasn't a big deal\" and that I should have just cooked for the 11 people in the house because SIL worked.\n\nETA: since there a lot of assumptions here about the men that I refuse to tolerate: the men fish every day we are here. When they get home and after we eat (around 4pm) all the ladies take off and do whatever we want while the men stay home with the kids and have fires, s'mores, movies, snacks and bedtime around 10-11, depending on the activity that night. It's equally split. Also, I have 2 kids. She has 5. I don't need to \"slow down on having kids because 7 for one person is too much\". She picked up these shifts. She was supposed to have the entire 4 days off. She never ran it by anyone until after the guys had already left for the day and generally speaking, the guys don't have service where they go fishing. So I had already cooked for 8 people (all the kids and myself) twice during those 3 days, as well as did laundry and dishes. More than enough for a guest that was invited to your home under the false pretense of a \"vacation\".", "created_utc": 1689086129, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14wt4e6/aita_for_refusing_to_cook_at_my_sils_because_im/", "score": 616, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds odd she would pick up 4 shifts when people are staying with them if she really wanted people to be staying with her. Also fair enough the men are out enjoying fishing, but leaving you alone for four days fishing seems a bit much \u2026.. your plans changed maybe there\u2019s should have as well", "NTA, you sure she worked and didn\u2019t end up at a mall or something to get a break from her kids and a free maid to do the work around the house?!", "NTA, what a mess. To me, the fault lies with your SIL, BIL and husband. With you being heavily pregnant, either the SIL should\u2019ve stayed home instead of working, or your husband & BIL should\u2019ve stayed home instead of fishing. No way should you be watching 7 kids and cooking by yourself with the state of your pregnancy.", "NTA - There was, indeed, a vacation.

There's a pack of **ramen** on the counter - have at it!\n\nSo now you know you will either be staying home next \"visit\" or getting a hotel room with the kids so you can \"have a vacation\" without being a slave. Maid. Babysitter. Chef. While she was out avoiding her own kids. What an entitled piece of work she is \\*smh\\*", "NTA\n\nBut are you sure you are really welcomed there every year? To me this sounds like your SIL is fed up with these visits. Why are you driving there for 21 hours to stay at home with the kids if your husband can go alone or with the kids and see his BIL for fishing (since this seem to be the main purpose of these visits anyway)? Sure, the dudes then have to take the kids with them, but your husband and BIL are still their dads, so this shouldn't be a hassle. \n\nI just don't get it why you would visit someone who doesn't want you there...  and you leaving early was maybe the biggest relief for her (despite you thinking this was a punishment, lol).", "Esh.

I\u2019ll then sweep the floor and feed the cats. When the kids were young, I would drive 4 hours with my young son to their house for the weekend to babysit their 3 because they did not leave their kids with sitters.

You won\u2019t tolerate any criticism of the men who happily left you behind every day, their needs must be met in your family dynamic.  Maybe SIL is over being the slave to everyone\u2019s vacations and is protesting the only way she knows how.

I would resolve this now though \n\n\"SiL, I'd like to resolve this unpleasantness, rather than to let it sit. Going forward, let's speak ahead of visits and work out a general understanding of our respective reaponsibilities so that we avoid such situations in the future. I do not respond well to entitlement, or being called lazy when I just spent the day referee'ing seven children while 8 months pregnant, particularly when my doing so allowed you to work an extra shift and pick up extra money without any corresponding childcare cost. So for me to babysit the seven kids, fibe of whom are your children, so that the men could go fish, and you go work, that was me picking up work you typically are responsible for (watching your five kids), so for you to come home from your optional shift at work and to accuse me of sitting around doing nothing, being lazy all day, seemed not just unkind, but ungrateful and entitled. I don't respond well to such treatment. Is that your experience, on the days you watch your five children? That you get to sit around being lazy all day, doing nothing?  I'd be surprised if you view it that way. I can confidently say that watching seven children while 32 months pregnant was not a lazy day for me. \n\nWhat's unfortunate here in my mind is that I might well have been happy to make dinner if you had simply approached me to discuss it in a non-confrontational, non-accusatory way, one adult to another, but instead, you took this approach that ensured I wouldn't do so. Do you some sort of pre-existing dislike or resentment towards me? Perhaps you feel I don't pull my weight in general at such gatherings, or expect too much of you in some way? If so, treating me the way you did makes it a self-fulfilling prophecy, it guarantees what you dislike about me will continue. Alternatively, feel free to let me know what issue you have with me so that I am aware if it. I am usually more than happy to ensure communal work is shared fairly \n\nIf I don't hear from you, I will consider this resolved, and will plan to reach out before we next visit so as to try to ensure we are on the same page with respect to responsibilities. Hopefully that will allow things to go more smoothly.\"", "I think your SIL is out of her mind and she would be a hard no for me from now on.

I mean, I *like* cooking, and doing it once or twice while I'm there for a few days is nbd.\n\nSo, I mean, yeah you're contributing, and you shouldn't have to do more than you are, but \"I'm a guest\" is 100% the wrong reason.\n\nYou could all just be a little nicer?", "ESH.

I\u2019m sorry your \u201cvacation\u201d isn\u2019t living up to your expectations, but why in the world should your SIL have to take on the responsibility of your family in addition to her own?  I\u2019m on board with you not doing laundry. But sharing in the cooking and cleaning up after meals is literally the least you could do.", "See, if my spouse was pregnant and there were 7 kids to watch and one of my hosts had to work, I'd...not go fishing, I'd help make dinner, I'd entertain the kids. The husbands owe OP a huge apology for prioritizing fishing over everything else.", "Yea I wouldn't be surprised if the last minute shift isn't even real.. OP said in the comments that SIL has 5 kids and she only has 2. In my experience people have too many kids all too often dump their children on other people in order to get a break. As if it's any one else's problem that they couldn't figure out birth control", "Yep- that was no vacation. Might as well stay home with all of your own stuff and not deal with packing instead of doing the same mess at someone\u2019s place with more kids in a place that isn\u2019t yours", "The guys had already left when SIL said she had taken an extra shift.", "OP says SIL didn't say anything about picking up extra shifts *until after the men left for fishing, in an area with little to no signal* so how are the men responsible?\n\nSIL owns this AH vote, alone. Redditors love to hate on men,", "Agreed.    Handing out s\u2019mores, watching movies, and keeping the kids hyped until they collapse after 10pm is not difficult parenting.   \nThat\u2019s easy mode \u201cfun parent\u201d, basically babysitting.    \n\nMaking sure the kids stick to a daytime routine, are clean, dressed, fed breakfast lunch dinner, and engaged in activities all day falls to the womenfolk.   \n\nAnd that\u2019s not equal from where I\u2019m standing.", "Good point - minimally the SIL's need to work combined with OP's advanced pregnancy should have prompted a change in plans and the division of labor during the trip.", "[deleted]", "Actually the men should have been the ones bringing home takeout.", "Except he didn\u2019t leave her with 7 kids. He left her with two children - theirs. SIL picked up last minute shifts without informing anyone until  the men had already gone and left OP to wrangle her 5 nieces/nephews all day without any notice.\nDon\u2019t get wrong i think the men are sucky for leaving all day coming back at dinner when the kids are already most likely exhausted.\nBut SIL taking on last minute shifts(when she wasn\u2019t supposed to be working anyway) and expecting their heavily pregnant guest to wrangle their 5 kids all day then complaining about her not cooking dinner is entitled AF.", "You'd think they'd at least be able to take off when the men get home, but nope! They still have to cook dinner for everyone too. THEN they get to leave once all the men have to do is have fun with bonfire/smores. Yeah, it sounds evenly split to me lolololol", "Then she shouldn't have invited them out. Again, your comment is nonsense, and the host is in complete control of the situation as she still has the power.\n\n\nLmao, what are you expecting? \nYou want them to drive 21 hours (after being invited out by the host) and see that the host is \"unwelcoming\" and then hop in a time machine and tell their past selves \"stay home\" ? \n\nThat's the only possible way for them to know she isn't \"welcoming\" after being invited out by her. Think before you speak.", "SIL was the one who initiated the invitation then voluntarily picked up shifts expecting OP to do the housework, watch the kids and cook for her when she got home. SIL sounds entitled and manipulative.", "If SIL is sick of it then she should keep her mouth shut and not invite them over for it. And the other relatives didn't \"get the message\", MIL was sick. And way to judge a mother for visiting family at only 32 weeks. How about the lack of sense the SIL has for making OP watch 7 kids, cook for them, clean her house, do laundry by herself while 8 months pregnant?", "They had already left to fish before SIL said she had a shift and left the kids to OP", "What if the hostess didn't need to work, and voluntarily picked up a shift after you'd left for fishing, in a place without cell service?  I don't think this is on the husbands at all.", "Yeah but after day 2 of her doing the same thing you would think everyone would have caught up to what she was doing.", "The men should have modified their plans as soon as OP\u2019s MIL and other SIL said they weren\u2019t coming. There were supposed to be four adults who stayed home with the kids while the men went fishing. Four adults taking care of seven kids is manageable but two adults taking care of that number of kids is a lot tougher.", "The men *were* a big part of the problem here. They\u2019re grown and (apparently) capable adults who just expect SIL (who was working) and OP (who is heavily pregnant) to do *all* the cooking and cleaning and childcare for the whole group while they go have fun the whole time.", "Because OP is pregnant by herself watching 7 children doing chores all day but its \"evenly split\" because the men get to go fishing all day and then end the day with the fun activities with the kids with bonfires/smores and they also get the easy shift as they are winding down to sleep and probably watching movies. \n\nDo they have to fish every single day? Do they do dishes/laundry/household chores at night? Why are they avoiding any serious responsibilities and leaving it all on the pregnant wife so they can get home from their day of fun and continue to have fun alongside the kids with a bonfire/smores? \n\nThe pregnant wife gets ~12 hours to babysit/chores and the men get ~4 hours to entertain with smores\n\nI think SIL is an asshole but so are both of the men leaving her in the dust to do all the work", "They were still gone at dinner time, from what I understand. Kids do eat very early.", "Tbh I\u2019m wondering if SIL had to pick up shifts at work because money is tight and her husband wasn\u2019t gonna give up his fishing vacation time, expecting SIL to just figure something out", "I feel you can\u2019t give the guys a pass here because SIL was doing this stunt every day and they still went fishing instead of determining if OP would be alone or not.", "Hence my initial, ESH. I guess Op is the least to blame given her pregnant state but she also needs to put her foot down with her husband if she needs help.\n\nGiven she took the time to write all this on Reddit it is clear she needs help.", "I love how she tries to convince herself that it\u2019s all equal with this \u201cbut we get to leave the house every night!\u201d nonsense", "This kept happening, though? It\u2019s a bit confusing because OP said \u201ca random shift\u201d (singular) but then also said it happened twice before that. I don\u2019t understand why, after the first day OP had to do too much, there was no conversation among these four adults about how to divide the work. Especially since there are usually more adults on the trip who can divide up the childcare and chores (though even when that\u2019s been the case it sounds like the women have had to do most of the work)", "That makes SIL the AH on day 1 for not communicating, but it doesn't explain why it would keep happening and why the men wouldn't have realized how grossly unfair this whole setup was, especially with MIL and the other SIL backing out last minute.", "That explains one of the 4 days, not the other ones. It also doesn't explain why the men didn't make dinner or pick up take out every night after their wives were either working or watching 7 freaking kids all day.\n\nI think SIL was rude to OP, but this is 90% on the men. They should have modified their plans--taken some of the older kids fishing, getting home earlier, etc. \n\nSIL was working, and with 5 kids may not be able to afford to turn down extra shifts. Or her boss may have given her little choice.", "Can't argue with that, I would have been suspicious after the first day. Seems odd that husband (father of five of the kids) didn't tell SIL to stick to the plans they had made. \n\nOP didn't have a (vocal) issue with the change until SIL got all shitty and entitled about cooking a THIRD meal, that day. SIL didn't even acknowledge that OP gave her 3 days of FREE childcare for 5 children, bought groceries and cleaned up/did laundry.", "OP says the fishing trip is a yearly thing, so again, no. SIL is the one who modified her plans, left her FIVE kids with a heavily pregnant woman, then asked her to cook. \n\nThere's no reason why SIL can't handle her own kids, while OP does the same.", "[deleted]", "Then they should have come home earlier, especially when they found out that the SIL would be working during this visit. They have some nerve staying out all day and expecting the women to have dinner on the table when they return. What century is this?", "That\u2019s a really good question and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the answer is yes!  OP says she won\u2019t stand for commenters coming after the men. But open your eyes OP, cause what your standing for right now is the men\u2019s ability to walk all over the women and take them for granted.", "Oh no, i\u2019m definitely not giving them a pass at all. Unless every day was a \u2018last minute shift call in\u2019 which with how SIL behaved it wouldn\u2019t surprise me in an attempt to be petty. But i doubt after the first time they didn\u2019t notice, so no not a free pass at all. \nBut why is she lashing out at her pregnant guest who has babysit her children for her all day, done her laundry and contributed $300 worth of food for a 4 day visit when there is 2 men available - more specifically the father of her 5 children?\nSurely her husband can sacrifice a day of fishing and send OP\u2019s partner alone so he can look after his own kids?", "I do agree with that, but in all fairness if anyone should be looking after OPs nieces/nephews it\u2019s their own father not OP\u2019s husband. OP and husband went for a 4 day vacation, drove 21 hours for her to receive passive aggressive comments from the hostess even after looking after their children all day. Like\u2026  why isn\u2019t OP\u2019s husband defending her, but more importantly why isn\u2019t the host defending her considering she looked after his 5 kids all day and his wife upped and left. \nWhy didn\u2019t the hostess feel the need to inform her husband she had to work last minute and that he had to watch the kids. \nInstead of leaving it down to OP to deal with.\nTbf i think everyone sucks here BUT OP.\n\nI do agree btw that her snarky reply to your comment wasn\u2019t called for and the snarkiness should be redirected to the men and the SIL. She posted a question you answered.", "(whoops my first response I didn't realize I was replying to you who said the same already lol) But yeah I agree 100%", "She went to work. It\u2019s not like she went out with her friends. You don\u2019t know their financial situation. For all you know, they couldn\u2019t afford for her to take four days off of work. Let\u2019s not judge an adult for working. If OP didn\u2019t want to take care of her kids, she could have said so. OP has agency just like her SIL does.", "Just because OP has no problem doing all the work while her husband goes fishing doesn\u2019t mean her SIL isn\u2019t justified in having a problem with it. Neither OP nor her SIL should have bene cooking dinner. The men should have cooked dinner when they got home. They were the ones who got to relax all day while the women did actual work.", "OP is not happy at all. Apparently OP and BIL and OP\u2019s husband would have been happy to expect SIL to take on 100% of the burden while working, but for good reason, SIL wasn\u2019t happy with that. OP should not have been expected to take on the burden. The two dudes are apparently clueless about how much work is usually done by the women on this trip, because the fact several of those women who help shoulder the burden didn\u2019t come this year meant the usual workload was too much for the two women who were there.", "I\u2019ve been married for 8 years and OP sure as hell wasn\u2019t happy to do all this work or she wouldn\u2019t be on AITA complaining about it. Sounds like MIL might not have been happy either, considering she bowed out over a sinus infection. The men are absolutely a massive part of the problem; just because OP is too indoctrinated to call it out doesn\u2019t make it any less true.", "I\u2019m guessing she lashed out at OP because the men are not to be questioned in the family.  OP will \u201crefuse to tolerate\u201d any assumptions about the men who happily left her alone each day.", "Actually, we don't know what SIL did. She 'could' have been hanging out with friends or hiding in her car, just as easily as working. \n\nThey were invited guests, who drove 21 hours to visit. At a minimum, SIL is a rude hostess. She left her FIVE children with OP, and implied that OP owed her services for staying in the home. \n\nSIL is tacky and ill-mannered.", "But apparently she wasn't supposed to work, she picked up those shifts at the last minute.", "OP said SIL was supposed to have those 4 days off but SIL picked up those shifts after the men left. And even then I don't think SIL gets judged for working, she gets judged for expecting a pregnant guest to work more than she does.\n\nEdit: a word", "[deleted]", "Ugh god\u2026 if that had been me i\u2019d have been dragging them 7 kids to that pond and telling Host to look after his own damn kids cause wife is at work apparently.\nI did see the bit where \u2018they have them each night after dinner so women can do what they want\u2019.\nIt\u2019s nice of them to take the kids from when they\u2019re already worn out for the day and ready for bed and most places are closed/closing so the women can\u2019t do anything\ud83d\ude44 \nPersonally you\u2019d think they\u2019d alternate. Friday: men fish : women have kids.\nSaturday: men have kids women do what they want and vice versa to give them all equal time on vacation.\nHaving the kids all day when they\u2019re bored/full of energy need feeding and taking to the bathroom regularly or having them at night when they\u2019re tired/winding down and doing low energy activities. I know which one i\u2019d pick \ud83d\ude02 these guys have got it made.", "Wow \u2026 so you\u2019re accusing someone you don\u2019t know of lying about her whereabouts. Even OP isn\u2019t doing that. The reason they drove 21 hours is because OP\u2019s husband is selfish. His wife is 32 weeks pregnant and he thought it was a good idea to have her travel and help take care of seven kids while he went fishing. What if the stress of that had a negative affect on OP physically? Even if the SIL didn\u2019t have to work, it wouldn\u2019t have been fair for her to do a majority of the work so OP could rest. The trip was just a bad idea and the men hold a lot of the responsibility for that.", "That happens. Maybe she looked at their finances and realized they couldn\u2019t afford for her to take off. Maybe her boss called and said the person that\u2019s supposed to cover for her can\u2019t do it, so she needs to come in and the SIL didn\u2019t want to risk what would happen if she said no. Let\u2019s not act like it\u2019s rare for a person to plan to take off work and then end up having to work anyway.", "She definitely could have handled this better. We don\u2019t know why she decided to go to work anyway. It could have been necessary. Plans do change and when they do, the adults have to change their expectations with it. After the first day, the four adults should have sat down and figured out how they would manage the responsibilities now that OP would be the only adult at home. There was a way to do this so the guys would have time to fish, OP\u2019s SIL could go to work and OP wouldn\u2019t be overwhelmed.", "Just centuries old unbalanced beliefs steering unfair gender roles that keep women overworked and underpaid. But you\u2019re right, OP\u2019s husband and BIL sound like really enlightened and supportive partners. I mean, I\u2019m sure they even babysit their own kids! /s", "Exactly!!", "Lol I didn't accuse her of anything. \n\nYou are determined a) the fault lies with the men and b) that OP is wrong. \n\nIt almost seems like you are the SIL.", "SIL is an ah . She had the days off and as soon as the men left she dumped her 5 kids on the heavily pregnant op and has gone working. \n\nWhy do this if you had the days off?!", "Right... Everytime the dada went off to go fishing she just so happened to get called in, leaving OP to have to watch the kids by herself. Chances are she used those as extra days for some OT and wanted to take advantage of free child care and possible meals since OPs family had spent 300 dollars for food for their stay.", "Now who's making stuff up?", "[deleted]"]}
