Thus, your child's needs trump going out with friends. Welcome to parenthood. Your ex is asking you to take your kid so she can attend a funeral, not a party or a week away with friends, a funeral. She didn't give you notice.. There's not much you can do in the way of knowing when someone is going to die. Even when someone is terminally ill, you can't exactly pinpoint the exact day/moment that they will die..   The onus is on her to either not attend, and thus not get whatever closure can be gained from it, hire a babysitter at an extreme cost, or take a toddler on a flight then to a funeral which is really not a great environment for them.

No, if you didn't exist I'm pretty sure your wife would try a friend or some family, but not a babysitter. And the thing is, you do exist!

Also yes.\n\nMaybe your ex should take you to court to fix custody and increase the money she gets from you, because I'm sure you're not paying her enough", "YTA and even your edit is horrifying!   You may love your son but you are currently not acting like a parent to your son.  There is a difference.  You mention you have him overnight is this regularly?  You say you pay part childcare, how much and how much support.  How often do you have your son alone without his mother or family? Alone like a parent does. \n\nCancel your trip away and does not make a comment I do not know how to find a babysitter. \n\nSounds like the your ex the parent in this relationship is doing all the hard lifting. \n\nI would take a long think about what your ex does with your son and what you do and compare.  Then rework your list where there will be large gaps and sit down with your ex and state how you can step up.   \n\nYou love your son then see all these comments read them acknowledge them and use them to show you how to have a great father/son relationship.   He is young there is time.  Do not make the mistake or letting a fun weekend away of getting into maintaining a good relationship to the other parent.

Super daddy of the year - when he felt like it. \n\nMy cousin (14) died. Horrible death, he was hit by a train when he drove over rails with his bike. It was so freaking devastating for our family. Like, traumatic.

A funeral isn\u2019t a place for a 2 year old at all. \n\nHe gets so so mad at me - mind you, I\u2019ve been extremely accommodating in the past to his whims because I want our sons to have a strong relationship with his dad - and he tells me that I KNOW he goes in a trip this weekend and they leave Friday at 4 pm. (Different cities, the funeral\nTook place a 2 hour drive from his place). \nI kinda break down and tell him I\u2019m so sorry that my cousin died in such an inconvenient time for him. I remembered exactly why the fuck I left him. I told him that. \n\nI guess that he got it then. That you can\u2019t choose. That if you have a child, they are you\u2019re priority and if it means changing plans, you will. \n\nSo he changed his plans, they left a day later, he apologized profusely and since then had been a responsible parent who will be there the second we need him, a huge step up from his Disney daddy role. \n\nI hope OP gets it as well.", ">Because you CHOSE to bring a child into this world \n\nThat depends entirely on OP's as of yet unknown gender.

We hardly let the body go cold in Ireland, and it feels like it takes a weirdly long time to bury people here in the UK.\n\nI feel like I have to warn employers: if a close family member dies, I will literally be sprinting out the office the second I get the call or I *will* miss the funeral.
