I pay for part of his daycare tuition.\n\nI thought things were going well, but today my ex  called me and said they need me to take care of my son all weekend because their relative (not a super close relative) died and they need to go to a funeral out of town and don\u2019t want to have to deal with my son on a plane or at the funeral service. I already had plans to go away for the weekend with friends, so I said no, get a babysitter.\n\nMy ex blew up at me and said a family funeral trumps a trip with friends, and that it was selfish, psychopathic and narcissistic of me not to cancel.

It\u2019s not an unreasonable ask that you step up to the plate and take care of YOUR kid when the person you are parenting with has a death in the family.", "YTA, \n\nIf you want to keep a good co-parenting relationship it\u2019s the decent thing to do to help out when genuine emergencies arise. How would you feel if you were in their place they said no and you missed someone important to you funeral? It\u2019s important your son is somewhere he knows, safe and happy so it\u2019s one less stress off the other parent too.\n\nAlso, who would be able to get there if an emergency happened with babysitter with your son during that time? It\u2019s important one of you is nearby.", "YTA, gigantically so. Yes, please do some reflecting\u2026", "This is why I\u2019m not having children, I also wouldn\u2019t want to cancel plans to deal with a 1 year old. \n\nYou had the kid, you stayed involved, YTA", "YTA. Grow up and be a parent! Your ex is right you are selfish!", "YTA you are a parent first. So that means you may have to cancel your fun plans with friends if emergent happen and you need to parent your child.", "If this story is actually true You are the biggest AH I've ever seen. It's no wonder children are screwed up in the head these days. This child will grow up thinking this normal family when you are so dysfunctional in unbelievable. You and your gf should have been neutered and spayed. People like you should never have children. I feel for this child.", "YTA. You're not co-parenting until you know the kid it your number responsibility. You're not a parent, my dude, youre a sperm donor that sometimes babysits the baby.", "YTA", "YTA. I'm sure you've had hurtful comments but your hurt feelings here don't matter nearly as much as the kid you are co-parenting. For you to even think it's appropriate to bring a child to a funeral but it isn't OK to take them on your plans is mind boggling.\n\nNews flash: you are a PARENT. you don't get to say you have other plans when you have a kid. You take care of the kid and make plans on the times your ex- his mother has them. A family emergency happened, nobody can control death. YOU however can reschedule your plans. You aren't dying. So you have a responsibility here, to step up for that kiddo.", "Wow. Your ex has lost a family member and wants to go to the funeral, you won't change your plans to hang out with your friends.\n\nYour child should come first your a gigantic AH", "Smh, this is why people shouldn't blindly breed, esh.", "Kids are very inconvenient. Of course your ex didn\u2019t give you any warning, because people don\u2019t die at predetermined times. \n\nIt\u2019s not up to you to decide who she was close enough to that she deserves to attend their funeral. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s being self centred. \n\nYTA. Your reaction IS extremely self centred. People don\u2019t schedule deaths. Support your child\u2019s other parent. The tone you\u2019re setting for the future by behaving like this will not benefit your child.", "I think it\u2019s worth to considering if you were put in the same situation what would you want her to do? Would you want her to cancel her plans to look after your son?\n\nAs others have pointed out, funerals are always last minute so it\u2019s not that she\u2019s been inconsiderate either.", "YTA.  This is your son and your ex has an emergency and needs your help with YOUR child.  This trumps outings with friends, every time.  If you continue to behave so immaturely and entitled, be prepared to never see your son again and start paying child support through court-ordered mandates.  Pick your battles, but this is one you will lose and look like a total flake.  Apologize immediately for the AH response and take your son for the weekend before it's too late.", "Did you expect your ex to i form you in advance that a relative would die and they would have to attend a funeral? \n\nYTA for expecting that. YTA for prioritising a trip with your friends instead of your kid.", "Dude, come on! People don\u2019t plan to die and it\u2019s not like your ex did this on purpose. \n\nYou need to suck it up and cancel your plans. You\u2019re a father first and foremost and you need to be there for him. \n\nYou are being selfish. \n\nYTA.", "So you love your son but are still not gonna cancel your plans? Dude get over it and just watch the damn kid\u2026 god to parents like you piss me off . Don\u2019t pump a kid into someone if you aren\u2019t adult enough to actually take care of it\u2026", "Even if the ex knew about the funeral for a few days before she asked, she was grieving and processing. Maybe at first she assumed she would take their son with her. But after thinking it through she realized that taking a baby and staying out of town while grieving and trying to care for the child during the funeral while the child misses nap time would be way too difficult. So she went ahead and asked him to have the child for the weekend.\n\nSo maybe she could have processed things faster and asked him a few days sooner but he still would have said no because he wouldn\u2019t want to cancel his plans, and he wouldn\u2019t think it was his responsibility.\n\nYTA", "Damn I think NTA.\n\nParent A had custody for the weekend, and wakes and funerals take at least a day or two to plan - usually a week or more. Parent A had plenty of time to ask parent B or find a sitter OR be okay with taking kiddo cuz it\u2019s their time. \n\nAsking parent b isn\u2019t a bad idea but if parent b already has plans that\u2019s that. It\u2019s their \u201coff\u201d time.\n\nSigned, child of a divorce whose parents had split custody.", "YTA. \n\nBest of luck to your ex. My ex husband is an asshole just like you.", "YTA", "Notice how OP says part of the daycare tuition & not half? What\u2019s up w that?", "YTA\n\nI didn't need to read farther than your ex having a death in the family\n\nYou are a selfish jerk. Newsflash! You're a parent, and being a parent needs to come first. Grow up and do better", "NTA there is no reason she can\u2019t take the baby other than it\u2019s an inconvenience for her.", "NTA", "Well yes, YTA but the issue is much bigger then just the fact that you didn't want to cancel your plans with your friends. Actually, to put it better, both you and your ex are the Ahole. This kid didn't ask to be born. Yet your both talking about him like he's a dog you have buyers remorse about having. And this is what ticks me off the most. You've got people who would give an arm and a leg to have one, and your one of those who are actually lucky to have one and you both treat this poor kid like he's the biggest inconvenience on the planet!! Did you even want this kid in the first place or was this just some whim out of trying to create the illusion of one big happy family? Because right now the only victim out of you and your exes behavior is the kid who is getting treated like a burden by both his parents. Shame on you both", "2 - 3 days between death and funeral is common where I am. The longest I've experienced in between the two was my brother (5) days, and that's because of organ donation, if I remember correctly.", "I\u2019m hoping this is her wake up call.  She takes him to court and gets real child support payments (not just daycare) and a real schedule.  \n\nLike boo boo OP your life is inconvenienced, no duh you had a kid that is your life now.  He is definitely the type of person that take credit for babysitting (instead of idk calling it what it is, parenting)", "\n>Dude be more than a drop kick dad\n\nB-but but but, he had the kid over for really many over nights! Did you get that? This really attention worthy!!!! \n\n/s", "I made the same assumption, but isn't it funny how so many people when for deadbeat Dad?", "> She\u2019s the one choosing to go to the funeral of someone she barely even knew.\n\nBased on how this post is written (and OP expecting praise for contributing to childcare costs), I\u2019m assuming it\u2019s a grandparent who died - not someone the mother \u201cbarely even knows\u201d.", "Heads up, you don\u2019t \u201cwatch\u201d your child. You parent. Step up dude.", "Sounds like you should be paying a good amount of child support right?", "Who \u2018watches\u2019 their *own* kid?! Are you the baby sitter or the dad?? Next you\u2019re gonna expect her to pay you for \u2018watching\u2019 your son. Pathetic.", "Lol at the second edit. \u2018I had hoped to keep it gender neutral to avoid assumptions. But yes I\u2019m a man\u2019 hahahaha", "? You mean assumed OP was a dad? Yes...", "Because that\u2019s what happens in a family emergency. You don\u2019t get to be \u201coff duty\u201d just because it isn\u2019t your scheduled time. There was no need to bring the kid when it would be added stress and the kid already had another perfectly able bodied parent to parent them. And OP saying she barely knew them doesn\u2019t mean shit. Even so, she could have wanted to support other loved ones who did know the person. \n\nGrow up.", "I agree the judgement is the same of a dead beat parent.  If anything from been on the subreddit for the just few weeks is there's just a many deadbeat mom's as dad's and people in this topic are showing their sexism", "Perhaps the ex knows him better than we do and had valid reason to use those terms.", "80% of single parent households in the US are single mothers. That\u2019s from the latest Census.", "I'm not sure that plays a factor outside the US, at least not in my country where no-one's embalmed.

In Denmark it is around a week or two to get a funeral(depending on the way people die) And they are on all days, except on the weekend (Maybe in rare cases).
