I pay for part of his daycare tuition.\n\nI thought things were going well, but today my ex  called me and said they need me to take care of my son all weekend because their relative (not a super close relative) died and they need to go to a funeral out of town and don\u2019t want to have to deal with my son on a plane or at the funeral service. I already had plans to go away for the weekend with friends, so I said no, get a babysitter.\n\nMy ex blew up at me and said a family funeral trumps a trip with friends, and that it was selfish, psychopathic and narcissistic of me not to cancel.

Hope the weekend was worth it.", "Teach a ONE YEAR OLD about loss? Have you been around a one year before. \n\nOP pays \"part of daycare\" and occasional overnights.

I really was looking forward to sleeping in, AITA for saying no?\"", "100% on this", "I think the reference was made about the dead relative.

He can do what he wants but he shouldn't call himself a father if he's not willing to act like one when it's inconvenient for him. He's a glorified babysitter and not even a reliable one.", "It was definitely better for them.

Infact she seemed to revive as people showed up.  I mean,  clearly she was shutting down and *going* to die...but she lingered fora solid two weeks in hospice. People were like, \"yeah, so I gotta get back to china?\" \"Um, I need to get back to coste d'ivorie?\" Ask we had her memorial service with grandma in attendance.  She was pretty out of it by then but she got to hear everyone's goodbyes, thoughts and memories. For the most part she was comatose though occasionally her arms would shoot up to clap or something. It was actually really sweet. When everyone left she quickly passed away and we had the final funeral right away.", "This particular child is one year old. They will have no memory of this funeral and are not able to comprehend the situation or what it means for someone to die. Their parent should also be able to take the time to grieve themself or to support their relatives who are grieving without also having to be responsible for a very young, demanding child.\n\nIt's disgusting that you think a mother who is the primary caregiver is \"shirking her parenting responsibilities, doesn't want to deal with her kid, and is being a selfish deadbeat\" because she has a funeral to attend, but the child's father has absolutely no obligation to care for his child if he'd rather hang out with his friends.", "The child is 1 year and OP has had \u201cmany overnights with him\u201d. If this co-parenting was anything close to equal, he wouldn\u2019t count his participation in days. He also feels the need to mention that he pays *part of daycare.* In this parenting relationship, it really doesn\u2019t sound like the mom is the deadbeat parent.\n\nAlso: the mom is going to the funeral. Period. A funeral is important. So the 1 year old child could now be dragged onto a plane (lovely for toddlers) and then have to attend a funeral where he\u2019ll have little to do. I was at a funeral this fall, my sister had her children with her and one of them was the same age. It wasn\u2019t fun. Coupled with the plane trip there and back, it\u2019ll be at least a day of constant stress for the toddler. On the other hand, the dad could stay home and offer a great day to the child. This really doesn\u2019t sound like a difficult decision about what\u2019s best for the kid.", "> sorry but they co parent\n\nBarely. She has custody and he occasionally does overnights. He gets all the fun parts of parenting while she has all the responsibility. Sounds like he doesn't even pay child support, just chips in for daycare.\n\nHe's been very lucky so far that she's chill about their arrangement and has never taken him to court.

Funerals are for people to come together for mutual support and comfort.

I remember some days back an AITA bit over an ex getting her leg broken in an accident and asking for help, but OP was pissed because she planned things so carefully, etc. It\u2019s called LIFE HAPPENS.
