I had *plans*. How about you give me a heads up, next time\"?\n\nIt's non sensical. Shows you have either no social awareness of how death and funerals are dealt with or you have no care. \n\nIt does not matter she is not close to the relative.

Again, totally normal, socially accepted, human stuff.\n\n> And especially if my ex is going to fling hateful words and insults at me, why would I change my plans?\n\nname calling is not cool. being uncooperative coparent is worse. being a cold human unaware of social expectations surrounding death is worse. being self centered and short sighted is worse.\n\nYTA.", "With the limited information given, I am going with YTA.

You do realize that getting a babysitter for a one year old for a weekend is not realistic.\n\nAnd you can't judge how \"close\" someone is to a relative - because often they are there as a show of support for other family members and a sign of respect for the family as a whole.", "YTA grow up and be a parent.", "YTA. Parenting requires dealing with the unexpected. And getting a trustworthy sitter to watch your baby overnight is not that easy. It's not like your ex is partying. She needs to attend a funeral.
