So, I see the wife as a big AH with no respect for other boundaries. And before someone tries the \"you need to study all year, not just the day before\" I even missed important exams on these so called important family times.\n\nOP can be lying to us, not telling us some details, but I don't really need them, he has a health problem and already sleeps in separate rooms, he could be an AH in other situations but we don't know that and all the \"the wife tells him but he never listens\" bs but that does not matter. If you are going to bring an extermination team to your house, safety rule number one is to ensure that everyone is out of the house. Inhaling those chemicals is dangerous, not being able to smell them already tells me 2 things about her, she probably has her smell sensors damaged already (what is very common with people that use a lot of bleach for example) as she is a menace. If there's a gas leak, she probably wouldn't know until it's too late, and imagine that, we usually don't feel the smell until it's too late, just like some other chemicals used in exterminations.\n\nEdit: sorry, English isn't my mother language and I feel that saying the wife is a menace can be very misleading of what I mean. She is not dangerous, like a criminal dangerous, so, menace may not be the right word here and liability also seems too harsh on her, but I would definitely not trust her to prevent a gas leak", "Maybe she thinks you\u2019re the bug and she\u2019s trying to get rid of you\u2026\u2026. Also, did the smell bother anyone else other than you? I feel like more details are needed. Did she apologize that the smell was too much? Maybe she didn\u2019t realize it was going to smell so strong. You\u2019re definitely NTA for the part with the exterminator, she had no consideration of your space or job. I am married and there\u2019s NEVER another person at our house without my spouse knowing (and same goes for him). Seems like there\u2019s a bit more to the story overall though\u2026", "NTA normally couples or partners dicuss such things beforehand, I understand the window cleaners might comes pretty much whenever but generally for a fumigator pesticide company you call discuss when's good date and how much it costs and weather your  house should be empty of people. The fact that the first you know of a stranger spraying chemicals is the fumes and them walking in makes me wonder do you communicate well at all with your wife? Also they generally recommend houses be empty and then aired with windows opened after treatment is complete for a few hours. She blindsided you, embarrassed you at work, subjected you to insecticide fumes and wonders why your upset. Crikey what does she do to people she doesn't like?", "NTA. I have several friends who work in pest control, and those chemicals ARE dangerous. They should not have sprayed with anyone in the home, and they are supposed to wear respirators while spraying. Technically, they are pet safe after they dry, but the house should be aired out for hours after spraying, and the smell should completely dissipate before returning--usually about 4 hours. Is your wife really that oblivious, or is this intentional?", " I'm realizing just how little people know about pest control and the products they use", "NTA. Particularly since you had already had a similar discussion on the topic before. It's totally irresponsible not to inform all residents in a house that's about to be fumigated.

She\u2019s unhinged for thinking that was okay. I\u2019m worried about your safety to be honest.", "NTA, my dad has the certifications to use the same chemicals/process as the exterminator (he's a farmer) when it's time to kill the fire ants and spiders that like our yard and house he dresses in a full protective gear and tells my mom and I to open all the windows and leave for the day.\n\nI'm not trying to be funny, but I agree that it looks like your wife is trying to kill you. Is she going through any issues? Any updates to the life insurance policies? Arguing with you a lot?", "Nta. Your wife really sounds like she is trying to cause more health issues for you.", "NTA \nAlthough there are types of insecticides that are apparently safe to be done while not having to leave the house, I would still say that you're NTA simply because this was very inconsiderate. I would also assume, as with any maintenance/repair service, the time of showing is tentative, and the dude showed up late or early. That is me being nice because even if it was perfectly safe, and the timing issue was on the exterminator and not the wife, this still should have been run by you so that you could have prepared for the intrusion. Like, idk maybe by putting a sign on the door telling the exterminator to stay out. I mean hows the dude supposed to know which room is the room he shouldnt go into. That being said, if there is a chemical smell, i cant imagine the guy was just spreading diamatious earth around or something (a harmless, organtic material that kills bugs). I dont know much about exterminating, but we did have a bug problem and that is what i used so that we didnt have to relocate the family and the pets while having it done (and i did it myself). Either way, if this was an important work meeting, she should have had the mind to keep the guy out better than being like \"oh stay out of the room, second door on the left\" or whatever. It was very inconsiderate. Plus, idk what your health issues are, and even diamaticious earth (yes, i spelled it differently than the first time. I am confusing my autocorrect) can have health hazards because it is a powder and can make it harder to breath for people who have sensitive lungs. If you have health issues that make you sensitive to this kind of stuff, you really should have been warned so you could have made alternative plans for the day, or picked a day when you didnt need to be at your computer having meetings.", "She asked the exterminator not to disturb you, he's legally not allowed to do anything that would harm you as theyd fire him. Easy court case for him to lose. I reckon she should've consulted you as you have things to do so this spraying could be planned with both your jobs in mind. But I guess she just thought the exterminator wouldve talked to you first.  She's an ass for not accomodating your schedule. maybe she thought you'd say no but the ants are driving her up the wall. Main thing is the exterminator shouldve not done anything with you in the room. He's to blame for not following health and safety (should be fired!) and she is to blame for being inconsiderate. She needs to respect you have commitments. The only reason i wouldnt tell someone about something like this is if there was no other choice (e.g. something needs fixing immediately and the other person is downplaying the importance of the issue and/or doesnt care that it bothers me so much).\n\n Ask her why she didnt consult you about doing this, see what her thinking is so you can solve this issue. Asking if you're the asshole isnt the question you need to ask. we dont know how long she's been asking for this issue to be fixed with you, nor if you might be stingy and not want to lay for issues to be fixed or if you ignore her requests. Have you tried helping her with the ant problem or did you just ignore it? Do you often say no to her solutions but offer no alternatives? Or maybe she's an impulsive person and needs to work on thinking things through before taking action (e.g. adhd or raised by people who dont communicate well). Talk about it honestly", "INFO: what exterminator can legally do this sort of thing? I\u2019ve worked with exterminators before and am sort of incredulous that they would spray inside with people there. If they\u2019re a licensed company, they wouldn\u2019t do this if it wasn\u2019t safe. \n\nThe rest of it sounds like just a major passive aggressive breakdown of marital communication and I would need a lot more context to know who, if anyone, was TA supreme or if it\u2019s just a general sad state of affairs", "Truth is I never spoke about any issue because there wasn\u2019t one that I saw or that was brought to me", "NTA and the possibility that your wife is contributing to your health problems is not zero. I doubt this is the first time she's secretly used insecticides improperly. I also think she may have psychological issues regarding insects.

Just look at the huge lawsuit over Round Up weed killer, that was touted as safe for humans and pets. All one has to ask themselves is if the fumes are enough to kill a bug, what can it do to a human breathing it in. If you've already got ongoing health issues, things like pesticides can trigger them. I would consider her actions dangerous considering she let him spray while children were present in the home, and chose to bomb the bathroom with you sleeping nearby. She should have set those actions into play during a time when you and your family could be out of the home entirely.", "NTA this is crazy", "NTA. These are things that should have been discussed and agreed upon before hand even without your health issues being a factor. The lack of communication on her part is a problem.", "If I had to consult with my husband before every chore I would get nothing done in a week.", "I live this life. 99% she told him and he forgot.", "I thought this too!!", "At my old job, the exterminator would spray in our offices while we were there. It's not dangerous.", "I\u2019m not sure I get the joke here \ud83e\udd14", "I think you are correct as unfortunate as it is", "95% sure she's trying to kill and or incapacitate you bro. You recently get life insurance? Either way the gaslighting especially is super not cool and you need to have some serious talks or a trip down the courthouse to get yourselves some divorce papers.", "I wish that were the case. This was totally out of the blue. I don\u2019t do bugs and so if I saw them anywhere I\u2019d deal with it. But I\u2019d also be safe and considerate about it. Being a guest room I\u2019m basically one of the only people to ever even use the restroom there and so I\u2019d see any infestation easily. I have not seen a single bug of any sort in over a year", "That explains a lot because Terminex sprays my apartment quarterly, and I work from home and have never smelled anything.", "Good news is that I don\u2019t have any life insurance", "OP's health too. He already have health problems and she bombed the house with chemicals twice already. Concidering OP said there's no ants, it's weird.", "Sorry, I said inconsiderate voice to text didn\u2019t write that", "I agree. This for me was much more about the lack of consideration and communication", "Yes there are problems in our marriage lately and so I see this as a natural conclusion that she doesn\u2019t care what she does to me. But I feel that I was being gaslight seriously", "I was declined unfortunately due to health issues. So no", "How does the post elude to that in any way? It doesn't say anything about other household tasks, only mentions ants. Not even bugs that cause any damage until they congregate in large numbers (which also doesn't seem to be the case). It is completely reasonable to be upset if someone fumigates a shared living space without even mentioning it, and again, does not insinuate a lack of housework being done on anyone's part. If someone sprayed chemicals all over your house without consulting you, you would be upset, and if you wouldn't be upset you are the outlier", "Thank you. There was no infestation and there still isn\u2019t. I would not have had such a reaction if there were as I would have already dealt with it myself.", "Wife is claiming the ants are in the guest bathroom which OP uses everyday and he's never seen ants in there. There's no ants infestation so she's spraying for nothing.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

There are other issues but they\u2019re mostly irrelevant. I am certainly not perfect but this seemed to me completely insane and totally disrespectful in so many ways. I was blown away by the responses when I confronted her about it", "She did not apologize rather tell me I\u2019m overreacting and only said I\u2019m sorry you feel that bla bla bla. Not that she thinks she did anything wrong", "I can\u2019t decide if it\u2019s intentional or due to lack of awareness for me and the safety of the items", "I am trying to have this conversation. My wife wants for nothing. I give and provide well beyond what any human could ask for in terms of support and when there is an issue I am happy to help if I know about it. She does things on her own and I\u2019m grateful for that sometimes. But not at this expense. There haven\u2019t been issues that I can point to like this that were necessarily dangerous but I\u2019m concerned about her mindset. There are issues here that need to be resolved and I think this is a symptom of that.", "I think it may be a general sad state overall. I\u2019m nor perfect by any means and have definitely been TA. Truth is I think this is her being passive aggressive with me and endangering everyone because of it", "That is my feelings exactly.", "Why is that?\n\nAlso, when is getting an exterminator a \"chore?\" It's not anything like doing laundry or the dishes, simple tasks...", "Regular chores are different and you know it.", "I would agree with you to a point, because my husband will drag things out or else forget what day i picked for whatever, because i handle all that stuff. However, all situations are different, and it sounds as though she knew he had a meeting and she could have scheduled it on a different day, or else put in an effort to have the exterminator not go into his room. You cant tell a stranger \"hey dont go into the second bedroom on the left\" and assume he remembers that exactly. Ive done something like that been told to use a bathroom and opening the door up to a bedroom instead. I hadnt realized the first spot i passed was a closet and not to be counted while counting doors lol. It is an easy mistake to make depending on the delivery of the instructions. Like a large note on the door saying \"Not in here exterminator\". \n\nI do a lot of things without running it passed my husband, but somethings, like scheduling something during a day when I know my husband has something else he has to do, needs to be assessed. For example \"hey, i am making a grocery store run, but i know you wanted to go too. You said you had to go to your moms today. What time are you going to do that so that i can plan out our day?\" Would I normally \"schedule\" my trip to the grocery store? No of course not. He has no clue what I do throughout my day unless we are talking and i happen to mention it. Theres no need for a minute to minute schedule lol. \n\nKnowing your spouse has a work meeting planned and knowing that they cannot be disturbed and planning for an exterminator to come spray for the same time and place is inconsidered and a good reason to run something passed them. My biggest take is that if he has health issues, and believes that whatever is going to be sprayed is going to effect him, then she could have made sure he knew so he could leave the house for a bit or something while its being done. Thats like me and oil changes. It is harmless to me, but the smell of car oil makes me nauseous and i like to not be around when its happening. It isnt something normal people would think about, but my husband is considerate enough to be like hey, im going to change the oil, why dont you head in for a few minutes and ill let you know when i am done\". Little problems, easy solutions.", "The husband or the exterminator who barged into the meeting?", "That was my thought, too. \nI've seen enough Snapped and Women Who Kill episodes now to be suspicious.", "> **Arsenic and old lace** comes to mind.\n\nI **love** that movie and will watch it every time it's shown.  I know I could DVR it but there's something special about watching it as it air at the moment.  Plus if I'm depressed, this is the movie to watch, laugh my ass off and help me get over what upset/depressed me for that day.", "It is if you already have health issues.", "They are referencing The Metamorphosis by Franz Kafka.", "That helps. As long as it\u2019s not like a case of just ignoring something and your wife had to deal with it then would say NTA. Hopefully you guys can discuss this and work on communicating going forward.", "If you haven't seen ANY bugs, and you're sure about that, it's likely she's been spraying both inside and outside pretty constantly. Realistically, bugs occasionally get inside. A little tear in your screen, leaving the door open a moment too long, a miniscule gap in your siding, those fuckers FIND it and come in. If you're one of the many people who have a reaction to insecticides (yes, even the \"non toxic\" ones), that may be why you've been feeling ill. People who have reactions to certain chemical compounds aren't being dramatic or crazy, it's just that different bodies react differently. What may be completely harmless and not bothersome to 99 people can give 1 person debilitating headaches. Or GI issues, or however their body decides to react. \n\nThis is something you should be concerned about.", "That you know of \ud83d\ude2c\n\n(But do get yourself a carbon monoxide alarm, they\u2019re easy.

Then, if it's something like an exterminator, you have to clear out everybody to make sure no one harms the chemicals, you have to let everyone know \"Hey, theres gonna be a exterminator coming, please make adjustments to your schedules or spaces.\"\n\nOf course, making an appt is simple, but there are factors that come into play. Yall just wanna argue to make a point that is highly inconsiderate.", "You're comparing jobs that are not much dangerous, only involve water, wires, and a handy tool box, to a job that involves spraying harming, strong chemicals... okay. \n\nI think the wife should have given him a heads up, or not even do it at all until they are on the same page about when to call the exterminator and when to have this done here.", "You understand a small repair is different than spraying an entire house right?

I'm curious", "wait... so there are no ants? like you haven't seen any bugs at all? are you sure your wife doesn't have CO poisoning? there was a guy on reddit who couldn't get rid of his ants and someone said to check his house for CO and turns out he was hallucinating them.", "Safety first, my friend!", "The movie Arsenic and old lace is streaming for free on Roku...all will be explained.", "To bury him in.", "I have not seen a single bug either time. I asked and she said she saw a few.
