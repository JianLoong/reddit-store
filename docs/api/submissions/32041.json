She said there were some ants and thought it was ok to basically bomb the bathroom because it says non toxic on the bottle and \u201cher friends do it\u201d. I was first angry because that goes against everything I know about insecticide and safety. The kids rooms are nearby. But then also because of the complete lack of consideration that I have to go sleep with that around. I already have health issues and this just set me off. Not to mention the insane toxic chemical smell that took hours to dissipate. \n\nFast forward to today. I was working from home and was on a zoom meeting in this guest bedroom. It was a 3 hour meeting that I was leading with a number of people in my company and some others that have come together for a project I\u2019m spearheading; aka it was important.  All of a sudden the door barges open and there\u2019s an exterminator just spraying insecticide all over. First I bugged out from the surprise. Then had to leave the meeting disrupting everyone else. Then I smelled the chemicals that were now all around the upper floors of my home. I have had a headache since. \n\nNeedless to say I was angry about the situation. I confronted my wife who while downstairs with my children proceeded to tell me I\u2019m crazy. There\u2019s no smell. Not to be angry. There\u2019s no problem with spraying while home. She said that she told the exterminator not to disturb me but he didn\u2019t listen. And so on. \n\nAll that being said, AITA for calling her inconsiderate and expecting her to at the very least ask if that was ok to do while I was there?   I\u2019m not asking much but think that after last week she would have asked me before doing it with 10x stronger chemicals. \n\nI would appreciate the reality check from you all. \nThank you for your thoughts.", "created_utc": 1701314100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1878byt/aita_for_calling_my_wife_inconsiderate_and_maybe/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Extreme case and it was brought in illegally but it does show there can be fatal outcomes from using insecticides.\n\nEveryone who is old enough should be aware of when something like that is being used, plus know what exactly it is, any precautions needed, etc.", "The bug bomb was dangerous.

She's weird.", "NTA - the chemicals are bad for you, sure. But what I can\u2019t get over is the blatant disrespect of your career. You were lucky leaving the meeting like that did not get you in trouble. Why doesn\u2019t your wife talk to you? The bare minimum that should come from this is couples counseling.", "NTA", "NTA. Does your wife just not talk to you at all? How can you work from home, be near her 24/7, and she doesn't mention the ants or that she's calling an exterminator?\n\nThere's no excuse for this behavior. Your wife just doesn't like you.", "ESH your wife is an idiot for bug bombing your bathroom lol.\n\nYou're overreacting about the exterminator though because the chemicals they spray aren't putting you in any danger. As for him barging into your office - doesn't sound like it was your wife's fault.", "Calm down captain crazy pants. It's not the 70s, if they're spraying indoors, it's kid and pet safe. I just had the exterminator out this morning and was cleaning the kitchen with my 5 cats while he sprayed the whole house. You sound like you need to get your health anxiety under control.", "YTA. You have a lot of criticism for your wife while not mentioning your solutions for your infested house. Did you have a plan to get rid of the bugs, or were you expecting your wife to take care of it at some magical time when neither you nor the kids were at home?", "Tell your wife that you are okay with insects crawling over her children. Obviously you are.", "YTA- what have you done to deal with the ants problem? If you need an exterminator, it\u2019s not some scattered ants here and there, it\u2019s probably a full blown infestation. I understand that she should\u2019ve probably told you about the exterminator coming but what I see is you complaining without providing any solution. If you had an idea to get rid of the ants without using \u2018chemicals\u2019, you should\u2019ve communicated and then proceeded to do that. It sounds like you just complained about the smell and didn\u2019t do anything to address the issue the first time.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This sounds like my wife talking. Tbh I\u2019m not so afraid that it\u2019s going to kill me; I was more ticked off by the lack of consideration about the entire thing, knowing my health issues  as well as my work meetings. The smell that kept me from sleeping the first time and the work interruption the second time is what I find to be inconsiderate. I am not arguing the safety of the chemicals, rather the fact that these things were done 1. Without considering the impact on me (or kids) 2.

There IS no infestation. She saw one ant and bombed the bathroom on her own. The exterminator is through a company I have a contract with for prevention, but she went and scheduled them to come. The issue was about the lack of communication and consideration not whether there was a problem. If there was an infestation I\u2019d be the first to bug bomb the house while also taking my family out for a few days. Tbh, if she asked me to help or said there was a problem this entire issue wouldn\u2019t have happened the way it did. I would have dealt with it.", "The next update will be that the wife painted his bedroom green.", "If what you're saying is accurate, nta, but you have bigger problems. Your wife is either delusional and/or using this imaginary bug to try and kill you.", "Maybe I've been on this forum too  long but my money is on the latter. And in OP's shoes I'd look into whether or not those health issues he's struggling with couldn't be cause by outside causes. You know, like his wife."]}
