We each have kids from previous relationships. We have been together off & on for ab a decade (broke up for a yr in the middle). To my kids, he's their dad. Our kids don't mingle much but know who each other are.

His youngest's mother (who does not have custody & just gained unsup'd visits recently) has married a millionaire so naturally we're very worried ab her trying to go back to court for custody. We would not survive that financially (I'm a nurse & he's a teacher).\nSo- AITA- My kids & I go to my partner's house every other weekend when my partner doesn't have his kids. I have exclusive custody (no visits whatsoever by their bio) of my kids. By the time 'my' wkends arrive for my kiddos & I to be at my partner's, he often says he's tired & needs alone time. He also schedules his poker nights he hosts at the house for 'our' wkends. Since he has custody of his youngest, he only gets a break from the little one when he's with his mom on her wkends. Well, those are 'my' wkends w/ my kiddos & my partner. While I agree he should get alone time (everyone should) I'm frustrated it always comes out of my wkends my kids & I get to spend with him. My partner's parents are the after-school care for the youngest & help out a lot. So he doesn't feel comfortable asking them to babysit more to accommodate his alone time. They're also in their early 70s by now so it's too much for them to do more. \nMy partner doesn't want my kids & I to stay over this full wkend.

Sucks, but fair.\n\nYou want more than the scraps of time he has to allocate to you, nevermind what he can offer your kids. Also a very fair thing to want.\n\nYou really have only three options here, as I see it. 1) You compromise and get married. Now you can live together, and there's some more time to spend together, even if it's just an hour before bed. But, this might not solve the priority issues and you won't know until you're already married. 2) You break up and find a partner whose lifestyle is more in line with your own. Someone who has the time and ability to fulfill your relationship needs. 3) You continue to stick with the status quo, knowing nothing can get better until whichever of his kids has a morality clause in their custody agreement reaches maturity.

There is nothing an ex can do about keeping a new partner away from their kids unless that partner is a proven danger, and even then, it\u2019s still really challenging.
