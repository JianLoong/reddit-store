We each have kids from previous relationships. We have been together off & on for ab a decade (broke up for a yr in the middle). To my kids, he's their dad. Our kids don't mingle much but know who each other are. This is due to his kids' moms (2 ex wives) being extremely litigious & would bury us in court drama for years & drain us financially if they knew he was with me. His youngest's mother (who does not have custody & just gained unsup'd visits recently) has married a millionaire so naturally we're very worried ab her trying to go back to court for custody. We would not survive that financially (I'm a nurse & he's a teacher).\nSo- AITA- My kids & I go to my partner's house every other weekend when my partner doesn't have his kids. I have exclusive custody (no visits whatsoever by their bio) of my kids. By the time 'my' wkends arrive for my kiddos & I to be at my partner's, he often says he's tired & needs alone time. He also schedules his poker nights he hosts at the house for 'our' wkends. Since he has custody of his youngest, he only gets a break from the little one when he's with his mom on her wkends. Well, those are 'my' wkends w/ my kiddos & my partner. While I agree he should get alone time (everyone should) I'm frustrated it always comes out of my wkends my kids & I get to spend with him. My partner's parents are the after-school care for the youngest & help out a lot. So he doesn't feel comfortable asking them to babysit more to accommodate his alone time. They're also in their early 70s by now so it's too much for them to do more. \nMy partner doesn't want my kids & I to stay over this full wkend. He refuses to tell me why & keeps saying he doesn't need a reason, no is a complete sentence. Meanwhile my kids are dying to see their dad & count down each day until it's their time again. We fight ab this constantly constantly constantly. AITA or is he?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So he has to choose who to shortchange, and that's consistently you and your kids. Because the other option is shortchanging his bios or shortchanging himself. Sucks, but fair.\n\nYou want more than the scraps of time he has to allocate to you, nevermind what he can offer your kids. Also a very fair thing to want.\n\nYou really have only three options here, as I see it. 1) You compromise and get married. Now you can live together, and there's some more time to spend together, even if it's just an hour before bed. But, this might not solve the priority issues and you won't know until you're already married. 2) You break up and find a partner whose lifestyle is more in line with your own. Someone who has the time and ability to fulfill your relationship needs. 3) You continue to stick with the status quo, knowing nothing can get better until whichever of his kids has a morality clause in their custody agreement reaches maturity. But there's no guarantee anything will change then either, now that you both have habits built over a decade that would have to be unlearned. And that's if he wants to change things and isn't satisfied with just the way things are.\n\nYou need to sit down and talk, and recognize that you both want reasonable things.

Imo she\u2019s delusional.", ">she also says he has full custody of one of his kids.\n\nThe youngest, who has recently started to go to his mom 2 weekends a month. Which is when op would want the guy to play happy family with her. \n\n>he regularly picks up her kids at games/school etc\n\n  She said that later in the comments, which usually means is a lie. In the actual post she said her kids are \"counting down the days until it's their time to see him\".", "They're probably pretty old. OP says she has been with him for a decade, except for one year in the middle of it, and partner's kids are from 2 different ex wives. I guess he could have gotten married and divorced once during the year they were separated, but surely not twice.\n\nUnless they were both conceiving children with other people during their relationship, all the kids are likely at least ten years old. But she does talk about them counting down the days like they're toddlers, so idk. It's a weird dynamic and I don't think he's interested anymore.", "Wait this didn\u2019t click for me till just now: he has two sets of custody agreements but they line up so he always has those kids together?  Even though these two ex\u2019s are super litigious and presumably would be more inclined to hate and attack each other? The two of them get along fine, but would go after the non-wife viciously, even though her not-legal kids have comparatively been getting more solo weekends with this guy than either bio-mom\u2019s kids?\n\nNone of this makes sense.", "He does all those things. Always has.", "Everyone is saying it\u2019s 1 weekend a month because YOUR post says e/o weekend EXCEPT for his monthly poker night, or whenever he wants alone time. 2 weekends a month minus 1 poker night & 1 alone time = 1 weekend.", "But you said he has custody of his youngest except for on \u201cyour\u201d weekends. So his youngest sees you regularly?  But not your kids?  Or is he already shuffling off custody of the kid he has primary custody of to spend time with you (but not your kids)?  Either you/your kids already overlap, or you\u2019re already taking him away from his bio kid, and yet are mad you can\u2019t take more.", "She thinks she has a partner. She doesn\u2019t. Respectfully.", "Blended? Lmao. She was the side chick.", "WAKE UP! get therapy, so you can see what is obvious to everyone here.", "The benefit would be not having the exact issue you're having now?", "I mean, at minimum it seems like she\u2019s in the vicinity of scamming her kids bio-dad since she wants this guy to act as the kids father in every way except the legal one which would change the child support situation\u2026 somehow.", "The court lining up the bio kids\u2019 weekends actually makes a lot of sense. They are half-siblings. There is a presumption that they should have a relationship.", "How is he doing all of those things if your kids don\u2019t mingle and he\u2019s had primary custody of his youngest for an extended period of time? The math isn\u2019t math\u2019ing here.", "How is he doing all of those things if you only see him 1-2 times per month?", "Good point. If he is OPs kids dad, and he needs time to himself one weekend a month, why not just have all the kids at the same time?", "Yeah nothing about this post makes sense\u2026. Either this guy has the absolute worst custody arrangements in the history of humankind, OR, he doesn\u2019t give a crap about OP. And she\u2019s a nurse! She can\u2019t be lacking this much common sense", "He sees them regularly not just every other wkend. Every other wkend is our extended time. I didn't explain that bc it's not the point of my post. He'd sue me for visitation if I left lol & nothing would change except mom wouldn't be in the picture on those wkends. These are his kids. You don't seem to get that.", "Yes, agree. I also think the 'partner' might be a scammer too - assuming he actually sees himself as in a relationship with OP, he has been keeping this a secret because he knew fine well it would likely have affected his divorce settlement and could still impact child support (the money the ex would have to pay him).\n\nEither way OP should rethink this, but sadly OP seems determined to be an idiot at the expense of her children.", "It might make sense to the courts, but if these exes are as vicious and lawsuit happy as they\u2019re being described, there\u2019s no way they\u2019d be playing super nice for the benefit of the other people with legal claim on bio-dad\u2019s time and resources, but going knives in on the person he\u2019s not legally married to. At the least, the bio mom of the older kid(s) would be going after the drug addict whose kid is supposedly cohabitating with her kids, even if younger bio-mom couldn\u2019t retaliate. ESPECIALLY if there was an affair involved.  Bio dad has an affair with younger bio-mom, either married her, lived with her unmarried, or didn\u2019t have a relationship with her at all, and older bio-mom didn\u2019t try to sue for more custody during any of that, despite being crazy litigious and guaranteed victory?  But with OP it\u2019s a completely different story?", "It used to be very standard.  My dad wanted more but the courts wouldn't give it to him.  Judge said kids were better off with their mothers.\n\nThe divorced people I know now (self included) all have 50/50.  Idk if it's the changing times or if it's a regional difference.", "You don\u2019t have to be married to live together. After 10 years you would hope there would be some display of commitment.\n\nIt sounds like OP is forcing herself and her children onto this guy. 1-2 weekends a month is hardly a relationship, let alone a family.", "These types of guys always have unhinged exes. Very convenient.", "Or at all.", "Sue you for visitation? If he is not their biological father, he can not do that. This dude is feeding you a bunch of bs. A lot of the people commenting are trying to help you.", "That\u2019s not how visitation works. He\u2019s not their bio dad meaning he can\u2019t do shit. For the love of god please dump this man for at least your kids.", "He can\u2019t sue for visitation, he has no legal right. Not that he would even want to either", "Girl, your children are a secret. Just like you. Those aren\u2019t his kids and you\u2019re obviously an affair partner from both marriages. YTA", "So he sued you for visitation when he was off with his youngest's mother?", "He would be laughed out of court if he tried to sue you for visitation. *They are NOT HIS CHILDREN and he has zero legal rights to them*. \n\nI think you might be too naive/dumb/whatever to be called an AH. Good lord.", "He's not willing to give \"your family\" two weekends a month. That's 13%.  You are by no means \"partners\".  You seem to value your independence: which is awesome.  Seems a little more independent to label this relationship as what it is: casual.  Neither one of you seem committed in a meaningful way.  He seems like he's barely interested in his own kids.  YTA (albeit a very sad one) for expecting him to commit to yours when he has never even committed to you.", "Beeches be crazy.", "This. It\u2019s a glaring missing piece. Kinda feels like the age window for this to make sense is very narrow.", "I'm willing to bet that that's another lie he told her. The girl sounds so desperate she'll believe everything.", "Yeah...like Tom Cruise put in a morality clause with Katie Holmes...does this actually happen with regular people?"]}
