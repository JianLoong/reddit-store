I was concerned about them missing school and being away for a whole week, but I didn\u2019t want to ruin a potential vacation for the kids. \n\nI decided to just talk to my ex-husband about the vacation plans when he dropped the kids off at my place. But when he arrived, he told me that he had already booked the tickets and everything, and that the kids were really excited about it. I was extremely annoyed that he would go behind my back but tried to be open to the idea. I asked him, out of genuine concern, how he planned to take care of them for a whole week, especially because he only has time with them one weekend in every month. He said that he has a new girlfriend (23) who is good with kids and she will be coming on the vacation too. This didn\u2019t make matters any better for me, I was still worried about my kids being away for so long and now with someone I barely knew. He argued with me, saying that she was like a mom to them and that they loved her, so it was decided that the kids will go on the vacation no matter what I say. \n\nThat's when I lost it. I told him to leave my house and that there was absolutely no way I was going to let him take our kids on vacation with his new girlfriend, even if I had to get the law involved. He accused me of being a controlling ex-wife who couldn\u2019t stand to see my own kids happy.

I feel like he wants to have the kids for vacation just to \"prove\" to his GF that he is a fun dad. And the only people who should be watching the kids need to be approved by both of you, not just one.\n\nAdding onto my stance: the kids never mentioned this GF.

He should\u2019ve respected the fact that you\u2019re their primary guardian and asked if it was okay with you to take the kids (especially since in interferes with their school schedule). I understand the uncomfortable feeling behind not wanting your kids to be around the gf, especially with the age gap (same sitch happened to me with dad and his partner). At the same time at their age, and with how little they see their father, a vacation may be good for them and good for you to see if he can \u2018handle\u2019 them for a week (non-fulltime and \u201choliday\u201d parents get the best parts and often forget the little things that go into the daily care of their children when they\u2019re not around them 24/7). \n\nAt the end of the day, as their primary parent, you have the right to say no to anything that involves your kids.

It\u2019s best to put ourselves in the poster\u2019s position and see what solution we would need in their place. That\u2019s how it should be. People are here asking for help, we should give it without getting personal and attacking the posters", "He's an ex for a reason and I can see why.\n\nPlease do not let him take your kids on his weird escapade. I firmly believe your children are at risk in his \"care.\" These risks can range from minor inconveniences to life threatening.\n\nHe is irresponsible, forces parentification on the oldest, will leave the kids unsupervised for hours, does not take the necessary precautions for your kid's allergy, does not even know what to do if your kiddo suffers an extreme reaction, is lazy, is careless, is selfish, doesn't seem concerned with their safety, etc.\n\nWhat if there is a medical emergency while they're on this vacation? What if kiddo goes into anaphylaxis shock because he didn't communicate with his gf about their allergies? What if he did and they're both not mindful enough to remember?\n\nAre they going out of state/province/country? Dealing with medical emergencies in your own country is already stressful; dealing with it in a foreign place adds a whole new layer of complexity and stress.\n\nYour ex is a liability. You said he is not reliable and i want to remind you/ validate your concerns -- I'm assuming hes done similar manipulative tactics on the past to make you second guess yourself so he can get bis way. I highly recommend staying firm on not letting him take the kids.", "It hits close to home for me. My ex all of a sudden wanted my daughter more once he got a gf and eventual wife. She was able to take care of my daughter.\n\nIt made me irritated. It's like, if you're gonna have someone else take care of her, just let her stay with me.", "I think the fact that they were neglected was what made her think they were neglected.", "Can also fuck over kids whose religious holidays don't line up with the school holidays, like Jewish and Muslim kids in schools whose school holidays line up with the Christian holidays.", "Yes there are exception circumstances where holidays can be authorised", "I agree wholeheartedly. NTA OP, keep track of all of it too. I\u2019ve been there and it\u2019s tough. Luckily here we are 10 years later (wow! Just realized that.) and we coparent like totally bosses.", "This is a bot & stolen comment from thread.", "My dad used to do this. We'd go on vacation every couple of years and dad would pull me out of school for a week in the middle of the year. Camp sites and hotels are cheaper in the off seasons and he'd say he didn't save for two years for a vacation to be surrounded by everyone else talking their kids on holiday on in the middle of school holidays. Never did me any harm, I was always top of classes", "Those get exceptions", "Yeah like maybe if you live in California/Florida and Disney is an hour or two away, but if it's costing you 6 thousands dollars to get there... it's kind of a big thing.", "Yes! Took my kids out for a week in October to go to Disney and we made memories for a lifetime.", "It depends on the kid. I could easily miss a couple of weeks and be caught up when I got back. Even when I missed two and a half weeks when I was sick. My brother brought my assignments home and I was done with them days before I went back to school.", "NTA\nGet approval to take the time off before booking a trip is vacation planning 101.\nAnd I wonder if he really booked anything yet, or was BSing that to try and make it seem like a done deal as part of talking you into it.", "ESH\nYour primary issue was that another woman was coming on the trip. You didn't even ask how serious his relationship was, he is going to move on eventually and those kids will have a step mom. Just like at some point you'll move on and those kids will have a step dad. \nYour ex is taking the kids out of school for a week long trip. It would be better to take them during an off-week, weird that he planned during school. However after he told you about the trip and you didn't ask, he probably assumed you were okay with it.", "NTA for the mom but MAN do I feel bad for her kids. Sounds like Dad told them all about this exciting vacation they're going to go on and now... nope. Dad's an AH for even creating this situation, when he could've handled it with respect to mom.\n\nNow kids are totally going to be bummed... maybe take them out to a movie and ice cream on the weekend or something to smooth over the sour taste of disappointment?", "Its a school week. He didn't discuss with you, he informed you of his decision. A woman he barely knows, and you never sawy is going to be watching your kids when. Also, calling her \"mom\" in front of you, ufff. No, just no. So many thungs are wrong all of this. NTA", "YTA, there was a better way to handle this. \n\nPeople will tell you that you're not, but you are. \n\nWho got hurt most here? \n\nThe children. \n\nI notice that after divorce, some people use the children as pawns of controlling lives, their no longer a part of. \n\nYou could've handled it better.", "Here in uk the fine is per child and per parent and per day unless the school gives permission.", "He should of discussed with you since he only has them weekends. However i think they should be allowed to go.", "NTA - he sounds really immature. This kind of person wouldn't plan well for a vacation with the kids.", "ESH\n\nDad AH -\n\nTaking kids out from school without consent from the other parent is critical. Also since you said that he has the kids only 1 weekend per month, I assume that taking them for a weeklong trip goes outside custody agreement.\n\nMom/OP AH -\n\nIf OP was to start dating a new person, is it okay for the dad to refuse the kids go on trips with Mom's partner? There has to be a level of trust between mom and dad to have a healthy co-parenting situation. Also, blowing up in front of the kids will only make dad become a martyr and mom become a villain.", "\"new girlfriend\"\n\n\"like a mom\"\n\ni think this guy doesn't understand the concept of mom", "I mean realistically not much is learned in schools in 2 weeks...or even 1 term sometimes lol.  Unless the kid is behind from his peers usually most of class tiem is spent trying to calm down the naughty kids, repeat things 50 times for the kids that are not understanding etc.   \nThis is the same through high school and even some university classes.   \n\n\nMissing 2 weeks of primary school is not really gonna put your kid behind unless they're already really struggling.  \n\n\nThat being said the issue here is the \"new\" gf mum has never heard of who is 23 and he plans on using her as his \"Secret weapon\" to care for the kids since he couldnt POSSIBLY do that himself for a week. Ew.  \n\n\nNTA OP", "I was the kid in this situation. My and my dad planned a trip behind my mum\u2019s back (I was too little to understand that but dad was aware) and told her last minute. She got mad and cancelled it. I\u2019m an adult now, in therapy ofc, working on forgiving my parents for being two children raising a child. Just hearing this happening to other kids makes me so angry. Make sure you explain or make up for it to the kids, they DO NOT DESERVE bad co parenting", "What country is that, North Korea?  That's an asinine law.\n\nWay too many people confuse school with education.", "Yes let's restrict kid's lives even more. It's not like they have little to no freedom already.\n\n\nThe degree to which people think children are objects to be done with as they please is depressing but unsurprising.", "If it were me and my previously known to be neglectful ex who didn't have the right suddenly sprung on me that he had booked and paid for a holiday during term time for the children, already told them, and when asked how he was going to handle them in a safe way for that long when he hasn't had them previously he answered his new early 20s gf I'd never met, I would also be like \"erm, hang on, not a chance\". Nothing is planned or discussed and she's being safe.", "No it\u2019s a country that cares about childhood development and learning, as well as making sure all children are seen by the system that is meant to protect them.", "Ah yes freedom is what children need, not structure and an education", "Switzerland?", "Yes that is literally the point I\u2019m making in my comment. If we allow exceptions and just let people take their kids out whenever we think is good who\u2019s to say it\u2019ll be enforced fairly and not just \u201cwel that\u2019s not a religion we like so no holiday for you\u201d", "Switzerland also has mandatory schooling yes", "Thanks for sharing that. It makes me happy to know that Carrie Fisher was nice. I liked her so much and am so sorry she is gone now.", "Yes, I remember a small controversy when Roger Federer's daughters turned school aged and were still on tour with their dad lol. They had tutors, but apparently that's not allowed in Switzerland."]}
