I was concerned about them missing school and being away for a whole week, but I didn\u2019t want to ruin a potential vacation for the kids. \n\nI decided to just talk to my ex-husband about the vacation plans when he dropped the kids off at my place. But when he arrived, he told me that he had already booked the tickets and everything, and that the kids were really excited about it. I was extremely annoyed that he would go behind my back but tried to be open to the idea. I asked him, out of genuine concern, how he planned to take care of them for a whole week, especially because he only has time with them one weekend in every month. He said that he has a new girlfriend (23) who is good with kids and she will be coming on the vacation too. This didn\u2019t make matters any better for me, I was still worried about my kids being away for so long and now with someone I barely knew. He argued with me, saying that she was like a mom to them and that they loved her, so it was decided that the kids will go on the vacation no matter what I say. \n\nThat's when I lost it. I told him to leave my house and that there was absolutely no way I was going to let him take our kids on vacation with his new girlfriend, even if I had to get the law involved. He accused me of being a controlling ex-wife who couldn\u2019t stand to see my own kids happy.

I feel like he wants to have the kids for vacation just to \"prove\" to his GF that he is a fun dad. And the only people who should be watching the kids need to be approved by both of you, not just one.\n\nAdding onto my stance: the kids never mentioned this GF.

He should\u2019ve respected the fact that you\u2019re their primary guardian and asked if it was okay with you to take the kids (especially since in interferes with their school schedule). I understand the uncomfortable feeling behind not wanting your kids to be around the gf, especially with the age gap (same sitch happened to me with dad and his partner). At the same time at their age, and with how little they see their father, a vacation may be good for them and good for you to see if he can \u2018handle\u2019 them for a week (non-fulltime and \u201choliday\u201d parents get the best parts and often forget the little things that go into the daily care of their children when they\u2019re not around them 24/7). \n\nAt the end of the day, as their primary parent, you have the right to say no to anything that involves your kids.

She\u2019s a new GF, you\u2018ve never met her, but the kids love her like a mom already..?  \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\n\nAnd even if the GF is cool and a genuinely good person who\u2019s good with kids, it sounds like your ex was going to essentially pawn the care of the kids on her all that week anyway\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s sad if your children are disappointed, but your ex went about this all the wrong way\u2026", "What is super weird about this is almost every school (in America at least) has a spring break. Why couldn\u2019t dad schedule it so the kids don\u2019t miss school?", "NTA. Okay wait - with your custody agreement, can he just say \"hey, I'm taking the kids during your allotted legal custody time\"? Agreements vary, of course, but I'm guessing the answer is \"absolutely not\"\n\nHe sees them for 2 days per month but is saying that OP's kids think of his 14 years younger new girlfriend as a second mom? okaaaaaay. \n\nThis whole thing is super sketch. If he made these plans without doing any of the legal custody stuff (like getting you to agree to it), then he's fucked. He can't force the issue. And you're not a jerk for saying your young children can't go on this wack-ass poorly planned vacation.", "Then OP would need to meet her parents First\u2026 you know\u2026 to have sleepovers with other kids you always meet the parents first lol", "He was neglectful previously and left the children home alone, which is why he only has 1 weekend a month.", "Not when its outside of his custody time which is ONE WEEKEND A MONTH he doesn't. Op has majority custody which means the ex has to clear things with her first. Which he didn't do.", "First few weeks are the worst ones to miss. It\u2019s when teachers do their assessments of the children, introduce new topics, establish classroom routine and expectations. It\u2019s also when most friendship groups are re-established after the summer break. If children miss those they are spending weeks on catch up both academically and socially. I\u2019m not surprised teachers hated him knowing they would have to fix all the damage he had done.", "Especially on days outside his custodial order? \n\nLike if it was just over his one weekend a month, not much she can do unless their custody order necessitates her permission for the kids to leave the state. \n\nBut to book and *whole week* which would be at least 5 days of her time without asking is just nuts.", "There are over 6 million members and probably a lot of commenters who aren\u2019t lurkers. \n\nIt could just be the group of people on that day. Or event the time. \n\nI\u2019ve seen a huge difference in opinions float by depending on the time (ie if the US is asleep, or if it\u2019s during the US school day).", "That's a good thought! She isn't mature enough yet (young 20s) and being na\u00efve about her relationship with the dad. So I feel like the dad wants to \"prove\" that he is a good and responsible parent by taking the kids on vacation. But I'm sure that the GF will end up being the babysitter then entire time.", "Yeah, I personally agree with you. A 23 year old has been a legal adult for five years. It is so infantilizing to act like women can't make decisions", "They learn structure during that time. While all the other kids have somewhat picked up on what they\u2019re supposed to do (it\u2019s time to clean up, it\u2019s time for lunch, it\u2019s nap time) you have to get little jimmy off of vacation time and on the same schedule as everyone else. Some kids elven pick it up quick, but others don\u2019t.", "I think this is only for schools in England and Wales, I don\u2019t recall this being implemented in Scotland (although feel free to correct me if I\u2019m wrong). I know for example you\u2019re allowed to go on holiday if the parents job is restricted to term time holidays (for example). They can fine parents if attendance becomes a worry, but not for individual unauthorised absences (like a holiday) afaik!", "Yeah I can understand that. I\u2019m usually more level headed but I wrote it near the height of my emotion with the situation and I\u2019m not the best writer to begin with so I know it was all over the place. It just sucked that I was voted ah bc I don\u2019t regret reaching out to her.", "I was that woman in my early 20s and at the time I thought \u201cWow we must have something really special to trust me with his child!\u201d No. Nope. I was literally a free babysitter under the guise of being his girlfriend.", "OPs comment says she has custody on breaks.\n\n\"The exact agreement is that I have the kids majority of the time and on the school breaks\"\n\nalso i read the post like he wants to pull them out of school for a week. usually that requires coordination", ">The GF is probably having doubts about this guy or is just plain na\u00efve because of her age\n\nShe probably thinks it's fun to play \"mommy\" because she only has to do it for \\~48 hours at a time. \n\nA week? Yeah, that's going to wear off right quick.", "He\u2019s got one weekend a month. That\u2019s basically as close as you can get to having no custody, besides supervised visits.", "OP has clarified that the father does not have more than one weekend a month due to neglect, specifically leaving the children home alone, so he's actually not capable of properly parenting. While it's lovely that you're an involved parent, you're projecting your specific situation onto a very different story.", "I would take the kids out for a week here or there when they were in school and that was no problem.", "I agree with you.\n\nThe first time the Titanic exhibit had came to Minneapolis my parents pulled me out for it. I also got to go to the science museum in St. Paul for an exclusive trip because my dad's company was the sponsor for the new exhibit that they were featuring. \n\nI learned more on those trips then I would have in class (I had to make up the classwork for those days anyway) or on any field trips.", "Back in the 1970s, when I was in middle school, one of my classmates went with her family to Disney for two weeks\u2014and it was not a school holiday. I remember being very surprised that a family would do that. No one I knew ever took off school for a vacation.\n\nTwo or three months later, her father died of cancer.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I was an adult that I put these facts together and realized that the family went to Disney to give everyone some happy memories before they lost heir dad.", "Okay but how do you know that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen? How do you know the kid will learn or catch up? Everyone can say their kid will be fine and maybe for some they will be, but there\u2019s also kids that won\u2019t be. Mandatory schooling is so that a child isn\u2019t left behind developmentally and so that we all have the same opportunities to go to school. Perhaps some kid will be taken to DC and have a great educational experience, and some might have parents that just wanna get a cheaper deal on a resort somewhere. It\u2019s not the job of every school to check if a kid is learning in that time, so it\u2019s best to ensure that the child goes to school where it does learn and it can develop well", " It's an all around shitty thing to do.", "That\u2019s super fair, for what it\u2019s worth I don\u2019t think you were wrong to reach out. It\u2019s normal to want to know who your kids are spending time with! \n\nHope all is well now!", "She's 23 and the oldest kid is 8 years old. She is in no position to be a mommy to either of them (especially since the OP has the kids most of the time). \n\nWhat 23-year-old thinks she can be in a parenting role of an 8-year-old (I know teens can get pregnant)? Babysitting in one thing, but playing mommy is different. \n\nI'm looking at the GF and questioning why she thinks she can play mommy for one weekend and thinks the kids somehow love her?", "I am stopping replying to you cause honestly that doesn\u2019t compared at all: a 75 years old had lived their life, but you don\u2019t seem to wanna get the point. Agree to disagree, go school someone else now.", "Oh jeepers. I totally get why you might be second guessing yourself and your responses...but don't. He was neglectful. The custody agreement exists for a reason, and that reason is the stability and protection of your littles. Follow it and enforce it without guilt!", "Yikes! How old were they? If they're only 8 and 5 now, I can't imagine how irresponsible that was!   \n\n\nThere's absolutely no chance I would trust this man to take my kids out of state for a week - girlfriend or not.", "NTA! He\u2019s been proven to be neglectful in the past and unprepared for your youngest\u2019s allergy. He planned a trip that includes taking the kids out of school for a week without discussing it with you first. He feels his new girlfriend, who can\u2019t have spent much time with the kids given the custody arrangement, is like a mom to them. \ud83d\ude44\n\nIf he wants to spend more time with his kids then he should be actively working on himself to be a better parent. His girlfriend can\u2019t be much better considering she\u2019s dating a man who only sees his kids once a month.", "And you missed my point that of course OP is going to paint a picture that shows the ex in a bad light to get the desired response.", "Agreed, sometimes you can\u2019t miss an opportunity. My mom let me skip a day of middle school when my oldest friend\u2019s mom told her they had an extra ticket to the Tut exhibit and my friend wanted to bring me. I was already mad about mythology by age 12 and it was only going to four cities in the US and one happened to be nearby and tickets were hard to get. My friend\u2019s dad only got them because his boss was on the museum board. My mom told my teachers she felt it was an opportunity she couldn\u2019t say no to and they understood, my history teacher even said I\u2019d be excused from all missed assignments if I shared with the class what it was like to see the exhibit", "My parents constantly stressed the importance of school to me but my mom still took me out of school to see one of the star wars movies on opening day. It's really not a big deal as long as it's rare.", "Yep, there are so many legit reasons to not get bent out of shape about missing school.", "The difference between an excused and a not excused absent, parent would have to file the info just like they would a doctors note showing the absents were excused.  It\u2019s not that hard and already done in some school districts.", "Thank you, I really appreciate it. It\u2019s been a long couple years but it\u2019s definitely been for the better on both ends. I\u2019m w a great guy who makes me happy and we\u2019re expecting a baby in late August and she seems to be pretty good for him. Both of us being happy only makes us better parents for our son which is all I wanted from the start.", "probably because OP left a comment saying she has primary custody because he neglected his children lol", "yeah the teens that have those kids though are babies raising babies usually. that's 15 years old at birth. i do know a child who has a 1 year old born 3 days before her 15th birthday. her mom does most of the raising so this girl can go to school and work. and it's a hot mess because having a child technically emancipated her from her mom. i guess there's a legal hiccup for household benefits since her daughter needs to qualify for WIC and the like. I don't pretend to know state laws.\n\nso i'd argue that your question remains valid as even for some teens they aren't doing the heavy lifting financially and or in actuality.\n\nchildren can think themselves to love anyone fun. but that love is also not without condition. they stop being fun those kids may not \"love\" them as much such as after a week with them.", "Yeah, I was kind wavering on NTA/ESH (mostly because her reaction seemed to have a lot to do with the presence of the GF), but this seems to seal the deal as a NTA as it doesn't appear he has the proven ability to handle the kids (with or without GF) for a whole week. So, maybe OP should tell kids now just isn't the time. Tell them Dad didn't schedule it properly and it won't work - they are young enough to not give the whole story. Dad works on not doing stupid stuff and hopefully (for him) gets more custody in the future.", "Yes but again how would they know that\u2019s what parents would do? And where do they draw the line of excused and non excused? It\u2019s better to just be equal to all when it comes to mandatory schooling", "There is much education done in a week. A whole spelling and grammar unit is done in a week. Missing half a science unit.... Is he teaching the kids that week?", "Well, deadbeat and irresponsible have different meanings to me here. I actually asked OP what was the neglect. It was leaving the kids (who are young) alone. So certainly non-trivial and validates a lot of OP's concerns, but 'deadbeat' means more 'uninvolved' and unable to assist financially. Dad can be irresponsible or even negligent, but not exactly a deadbeat. But I guess it can depend on why he's leaving kids alone a lot (ie to go get stoned?).", "This is such a good explanation about teen moms. I know teen parents have a very tough time alone, but they aren't capable of being solid parents. It's a reality that they aren't grown up enough to fully parent a kid. \n\nOf course I'm not looking down on teen parents because they deserve respect, it's the matter of them not being fully mature enough at the time.\n\nIn this case, the 23 year old GF is in no position to \"parent\" or be a mom to the OP's kids, especially the 8-year-old.", "It should be dependent on their attendance, needs, and grades. If your kid's a PPG kid scraping a pass and you're adamant they will still revise as you stay at Pontins the week before exams, no.", "I just told you, you file the information on your trip to the school office and they excuse the absence based on the information you turn in.  This is already done in some school systems.  When the kids get older, some will have them turn in reports on what they learned.\n\nSorry, I don\u2019t find the need to be as restrictive as you.  I would just pull my kid and send them private or choose other options if my school went authoritarian like that.", "I\u2019m sorry but none of what you said in this comment made sense to me", "I mean you can go private or whatever it\u2019s still the rule in the whole country, school is mandatory, even if you go to private school. Perhaps your kid will be fine, many probably won\u2019t be, the point is to protect all kids. And honestly, I find the views of people commenting against it to be very individualistic. Compulsory schooling helps give everyone the same start, it helps keep eyes on children, and it helps children\u2019s development. Just because you might be a great parent who will greatly educate your child doesn\u2019t mean others will, and personally I\u2019d rather have a system that protects everyone than one where people could fall behind", "I\u2019m gonna guess you aren\u2019t from the US.  We have lots of options and allow for a lot more parental freedom.  Our country has very little to do with school rules.  That\u2019s more maintained by states and can even be based on city/county school boards.  There is also home school where you can decide when your vacations are based on your own needs.", "Tne education system is not designed to be productive in the way you assume it is. Compulsory schooling in its current form is a) detrimental to childhood development (multiple studies you can look up) and b) not designed with learning or actual education in mind, particularly in places with restrictive education policies (like the US) that disallow things like actual science."]}
