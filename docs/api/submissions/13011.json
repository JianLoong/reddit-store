Last week, he texted me and said that he was planning to take the kids on a week-long vacation during school. I was concerned about them missing school and being away for a whole week, but I didn\u2019t want to ruin a potential vacation for the kids. \n\nI decided to just talk to my ex-husband about the vacation plans when he dropped the kids off at my place. But when he arrived, he told me that he had already booked the tickets and everything, and that the kids were really excited about it. I was extremely annoyed that he would go behind my back but tried to be open to the idea. I asked him, out of genuine concern, how he planned to take care of them for a whole week, especially because he only has time with them one weekend in every month. He said that he has a new girlfriend (23) who is good with kids and she will be coming on the vacation too. This didn\u2019t make matters any better for me, I was still worried about my kids being away for so long and now with someone I barely knew. He argued with me, saying that she was like a mom to them and that they loved her, so it was decided that the kids will go on the vacation no matter what I say. \n\nThat's when I lost it. I told him to leave my house and that there was absolutely no way I was going to let him take our kids on vacation with his new girlfriend, even if I had to get the law involved. He accused me of being a controlling ex-wife who couldn\u2019t stand to see my own kids happy. I feel like he was being ridiculous, I was just looking out for our children's safety.\n\nBut now I\u2019ve been thinking about it and I feel sorry that I might have ruined my kids chance to go on vacation with their dad, so Reddit am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1679592128, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11zr26l/aita_for_not_letting_my_exhusband_take_our_kids/", "score": 52, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not to mention the age difference is a bit weird. If he only has the time see them one weekend out of the entire month and now he's already decided to take them on a trip with some random lady without consulting you, their primary parent taking care of them more than he is, and he's calling you jealous? NTA 10000000 times", "NTA. Your kids can't miss a week of school to go on vacation with some 23 year old woman who they already call mom?? That's weird imo that they're already so close to his young woman & you've never met her??", "Info: Was your decision not to let them go more affected by a genuine concern for their safety or was it more a reaction to him saying that they were going regardless of what you said?", "INFO: You said he has time with them one weekend every month. What is the exact custody agreement? It would seem that if he only has one weekend a month, his taking them would be during the time you have them during the agreement. If this is the case, then he legally cannot without your approval. \n\nI think he did it and told them because he is trying to poison the well as they say to make you look like the bad parent.", "NTA it should have been discussed beforehand, especially since it involves the kids missing school.", "NTA.\n\nBeing divorced with children and shared custody requires both of you to talk to each other like rational adults. That's even more true when one parents wants to take the children at a random time during the year. (Why is taking children out of school for vacation a thing in the first place?) And it's even more true if it involves the children being supervised for long periods of time by someone you don't know.", "NTA\n\n* Your husband needs to actually communicate with you about his plans\n* Your husband wants to take the children out of school for a week\n* You haven't met his GF, who is way too young for him (37 and 23, that's a terrible age gap).

He should\u2019ve respected the fact that you\u2019re their primary guardian and asked if it was okay with you to take the kids (especially since in interferes with their school schedule). I understand the uncomfortable feeling behind not wanting your kids to be around the gf, especially with the age gap (same sitch happened to me with dad and his partner). At the same time at their age, and with how little they see their father, a vacation may be good for them and good for you to see if he can \u2018handle\u2019 them for a week (non-fulltime and \u201choliday\u201d parents get the best parts and often forget the little things that go into the daily care of their children when their not around them 24/7). \n\nAt the end of the day, as their primary parent, you have the right to say no to anything that involves your kids. Setting the boundaries of scheduling things with them through you needs to be done as soon as possible, especially when they get older (saying from experience lol).\n\nYou do what your gut tells you, and if he doesn\u2019t like it then so be it. <3", "NTA. Considering your custody agreement and his lack of communication with you. Also, telling the kids without communicating with you so now if they don\u2019t go, you look like the bad parent and kids will be mad at you. Really bad way to co parent. \n\nAlso- As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, you have absolutely every right to be wary of the new girlfriend. Considering he has a history of being neglectful to the kids, that makes it even worse. Not wanting your children who you are the primary (and more responsible) parent for, to be in the care of someone you do not know, is 100% reasonable to be upset about. I would not take someone\u2019s word for it that someone is \u201csafe\u201d for your kids. You never know. People are saying you\u2019re petty about the new girlfriend, but I think more parents should be more protective over who their kids are allowed to be around.", "I would have started with the fact he just assumed he could decide on his own to remove them from school for a week.

YOU are under a legal obligation that your children attend education. Whilst this can be home schooling, as your children are registered with a school  failing to send them can also put you at risk of criminal prosecution and if it happens too often and Child Protection get involved your children might get taken into care.\n\nSolely on the fact that it means taking them out during school term makes you NTA. \n\nThe fact that he is going on vacation with a woman you haven\u2019t yet met makes you even less of one.", "NTA. He never talked with you prior. He is the controlling ex parent here. He needs to learn how to actually co parent.\n\n She is good with kids? How does he know? She's only 23! Sure that's still a young age to be getting babysitting jobs, but come on. How long has he even been with her? Long enough for her to get his bank info? You never met her and she is still considered a stranger.\n\nStranger Danger", "NTA.", "ESH. He definitely should have told you before booking the tickets, however you should have no reason to say \u201cno\u201d so he probably didn\u2019t need to ask your permission (unless it wasn\u2019t his week to have them or something). \n\nMissing a week or two from school at that age is no big deal. Depending on where the trip is - travel can be an important learning opportunity too. So your concern about school is weak. \n\nEventually he is going to get another girlfriend and you don\u2019t have to like her as long as you don\u2019t think she\u2019s dangerous to the kids. Similarly he doesn\u2019t have to approve your new boyfriend when you get one (if you do).", "All depends on what the custody (court ordered) is.", "Well, maybe. ESH, I'd say. He really should have discussed this with you before arranging it (in fact, he legally has to, since it's a change in the usual custody arrangement and I assume they're going out of state at least). So that's his side. On the other hand, missing a week of school at 5 or 8 is meaningless, and a fun vacation with the dad they don't get to see much? It's a shame that was nixed. Unless you really think he can't handle them with his GF's help or have some other suspicions, I'd reconsider.", "ESH kinda\n\nI don't know what the legal custody agreement is in your divorce nor how the laws in your state work, but, if he has 50% custody I don't know hat you can LEGALLY refuse to let him take his kids on a vacation. That said, he deff approached this in a shitty way and he is kind of dumb for deciding to tell you the CHILD he is dating (I have 3 20-something kids and they are absolutely still maturing) will now suddenly be acting as a step mother at 23.", "ESH\n\n> I asked him, out of genuine concern, how he planned to take care of them for a whole week, \n\nThis is why you suck. He is there dad. This is a crap \"genuine concern.\" He is an adult. He is there father. He can watch his kids for a week.\n\n> He said that he has a new girlfriend (23) who is good with kids and she will be coming on the vacation too\n\nThis is why he sucks. Did you know about this new person who has been helping with your kids? That he would mention her kinda justifies your original concern, why does he think he need another person? But yea, he should've let you know LONG ago if theres some person your kids \"love\" that you haven't met.", "ESH:\n\nYour ex should've cleared the holiday with you before booking it which makes him an AH. It probably also would've been a decent thing to at least let you know he was seeing someone that he had introduced the kids to, and possibly even letting you meet her. However, I wouldn't say that the latter is common practice (as far as I know), especially if you trust the judgement of your ex.\n\nYou're an AH because the way you wrote the post it sounds like you only said no when he said that the kids love his new gf and that he would take the kids on holiday regardless of what you said, which is petty. If you have concerns, you could always ask to meet the new gf or at least ask the kids about her.

Maybe you have to get them into therapy.", "Nta. He's going about this in all the wrong ways. Co parenting takes good communication and trust. You have valid concerns and he just bulldozed over everything.", "NTA. They can't be out of school for a week without repercussions. Why is your ex dating a 23 year old at 37.
