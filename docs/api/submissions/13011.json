I was concerned about them missing school and being away for a whole week, but I didn\u2019t want to ruin a potential vacation for the kids. \n\nI decided to just talk to my ex-husband about the vacation plans when he dropped the kids off at my place. But when he arrived, he told me that he had already booked the tickets and everything, and that the kids were really excited about it. I was extremely annoyed that he would go behind my back but tried to be open to the idea. I asked him, out of genuine concern, how he planned to take care of them for a whole week, especially because he only has time with them one weekend in every month. He said that he has a new girlfriend (23) who is good with kids and she will be coming on the vacation too. This didn\u2019t make matters any better for me, I was still worried about my kids being away for so long and now with someone I barely knew. He argued with me, saying that she was like a mom to them and that they loved her, so it was decided that the kids will go on the vacation no matter what I say. \n\nThat's when I lost it. I told him to leave my house and that there was absolutely no way I was going to let him take our kids on vacation with his new girlfriend, even if I had to get the law involved. He accused me of being a controlling ex-wife who couldn\u2019t stand to see my own kids happy.

I feel like he wants to have the kids for vacation just to \"prove\" to his GF that he is a fun dad. And the only people who should be watching the kids need to be approved by both of you, not just one.\n\nAdding onto my stance: the kids never mentioned this GF.

He should\u2019ve respected the fact that you\u2019re their primary guardian and asked if it was okay with you to take the kids (especially since in interferes with their school schedule). I understand the uncomfortable feeling behind not wanting your kids to be around the gf, especially with the age gap (same sitch happened to me with dad and his partner). At the same time at their age, and with how little they see their father, a vacation may be good for them and good for you to see if he can \u2018handle\u2019 them for a week (non-fulltime and \u201choliday\u201d parents get the best parts and often forget the little things that go into the daily care of their children when they\u2019re not around them 24/7). \n\nAt the end of the day, as their primary parent, you have the right to say no to anything that involves your kids.

Make sure you're doing that.", "NTA you ex literally just decided he was gonna pull your kids out of school for a vacation with another women you never met. without talking to you about it. Anyone would have freaked over this", "NTA, but you should have all this spelled out in your custody agreement, no?  It is absolutely bonkers, banana sandwiches to book a trip like this before getting agreement from the other parent and that is what really bugs me here.  That's just plain dumb.  WTF was he thinking???\n\nWhen you say you asked him how he planned on taking care of the kids for a whole week on his own;  he's their dad and he should/will/has to figure it out and it might be super uncomfortable in the beginning for everyone but that is the choice you made (no judgement at all, I am a single parent and my son is one now, too) as parents when you decided to split. I say this as someone who struggled with this for many years and I come from a place of love.  \n\nI understand feeling bad that your kids are missing out on fun but this was poorly planned out.", "NTA because you both should make these big decisions together and he\u2019s TA because he shouldn\u2019t have told the kids before talking to you about it. \n\nThat being said, having divorced parents who are fighting is tough and a vacation might be nice for the boys.

Yes, he should have discussed it with you before booking. Yes, he should have tried to work with the school calendar, but they are 5 and 8 so its not like they are missing SAT prep or anything critical in school for 1 week.

Don't be surprised when your kids are all pissy with you from now on and still harbor resentment towards you for years over this.", "YTA. Yes, your husband is gross for dating someone so much younger, but your decision only seemed to change when you found out about the other woman.", "NTA. \n\nI think the responsible thing would be to be careful with whom you're dating - he should've talked to you about introducing a new partner, discuss when that would be OK. You co-parent, so there's no reason for her to be introduced to the kids at all, so what was that about?\n\nI know what it was about. She needed a place to stay so the 14 years older guy provided that. She might be the best person in the world, but you have never met her and he has never mentioned her. Ridiculous.", "I think your reasoning was solid (he needs to ask you, they can't miss a whole week of school) but unfortunately flipping out after he mentioned the girlfriend does make you look overcontrolling or jealous.\n\nIf you apologize apologize only for that portion.

So he wants to take them on vacation for a week during your time, at the start of school, and he didn't clear it with you? To me, it sounds like he's posturing for the GF, that he's just going to do this whether you want him to or not. And if he gets away with it once, he'll do it again.\n\nHard no here.

As a momma I read this and 'Awe HELL NO'd. The kids should never know before it's been cleared with you, he deliberately made you 'The bad guy'. He has probably 10 other weeks to plan something outside school days. And no 23 yo new girlfriend is 'just like a mother'. Good thing he's an ex. You've already improved on yourself there. He started this and you go finish it gf.", "NTA. If he only has one weekend a month, how in the world did he think he was going to get away with this?\n\nHe would literally need your permission since it\u2019s not his custodial time. \n\nAnd even if the court order allows him extra for vacation (such as a week or two per year), he would still need your permission if he\u2019s leaving the state and not having them miss school is a valid concern and reason to say no. \n\nAnd that was before I even got to the new girlfriend. I call total bs on them seeing her like a mom as well.", "NTA he did things this way because he figured you *had to say yes* if he already told them and booked everything. Plus his new gf is too young for him, and shouldn't even have met your kids without meeting you first.", "NTA. Your reaction might've been a bit over the top (albeit understandable), but he was an asshole for the following reasons: 1) taking kids out of school for a whole week without consulting you. 2) buying them tickets and telling them without consulting you. 3) arranging for the kids to be under the care of a woman you've never met without consulting you.", "Yes. You're a giant gaping asshole", "NTA. So he wants to take the kids with the new girlfriend and play happy family?", "I laughed so much, when he tried to say that the kids loved her like a mom. \n\nHow could they possibly love someone \"like a mom\" when they only see their own dad 2days a month. They don't love anyone like a mom unless its op. \n\nThe ex is delusional about his kids feelings towards his gf. He likes her, cool but that doesn't mean she is a mom to kids he rarely sees.", "My husband worked with a guy that would have his kids the first 2 weeks of school so they could go on vacations. He claimed school wasn\u2019t that important, especially the first few weeks. The teachers apparently hated him but the district couldn\u2019t stop him because he would make some bs excuse about it being educational and would throw together fake \u201cprojects\u201d for them to turn in.

There might be a reason he only gets them one weekend per month...", "Sorry but no way am I going to let my children go on a vacation, missing an entire week of school, with a parent that the court agreed should only have the kids on weekends with a woman I have never met or even heard of before this. Notice how she was concerned BEFORE the mystery woman was sprung on her, you know after she told the father she was concerned with how he was going to be taking care of the kids for a whole week by himself? This isn't being bitter, this is being an actual parent, not just a weekend one.", "Co-parenting includes having the parents meet any significant other, including one that the father plans to bring on a week long vacation with OP kids.

Is that considered a weird or off the wall take?\n\nSchool isn't that important and the primary reason Schools are so insistent on attendance has everything to do with budget and nothing to do with concern for the children's interests. Honestly, what could they possibly learn in a week of kindergarten that could be so valuable? How to finger-paint a bit better? Travel and seeing new things likely does have more educational value than the vast majority of school weeks. \n\nDon't get me wrong, knowledge and learning are important, I just don't think our schools are all that great at teaching it and a few weeks here and there isn't a big deal at all. Especially if you're making an effort to educate your kids on your own in that time.

Its an odd one because you cannot take kids out of school without permission of the head teacher, but the head teachers have a really limited frame to say yes, especially with attendance targets of 95% which only allows for 9 sick days across the entire school year. If attendance drops to 87% parents get fined. They worked it out that 5 million school days were missed last year due to parents taking kids out of school for holidays so heads are under massive pressure to not authorise them", "A lot of US schools now have strict policies about it.  It's kind of rediculous.", "My daughter's school has such a bad problem with vacation day during the school year that if they get over x amount of days, the student will be removed from the school and forced to go a charter or continuation school.

During his custody time he is free to take the kids wherever he wants unless you have agreements in the custody agreement that limits when/where he can go.  \n\nNAH - while you have a right to have some concern about his new girlfriend he will be the one responsible for the kids and not her.  There has been many breaks over the last few years so I doubt this is the first time he\u2019s had the kids for more than a weekend.", "And adding onto that point, the kids never mentioned this brand-new GF. So how exactly do the kids love her so much already? They rarely see the dad, so they most likely never met the GF.\n\nI don't know the custody agreement between the OP and dad, but having the kids once a month tells me that he isn't fit to be a good/responsible dad (or something else more serious). \n\nThe GF is probably having doubts about this guy or is just plain na\u00efve because of her age, so he thinks he will win her over by spending an entire week with the kids to be the Disney Dad.", "What happened that made you think they were neglected?", "I can't really say A H on this - just try to do better.

I\u2019m of course not talking about taking them to Disney or to the beach.  For example something like taking them to the inauguration of a president and touring museums in DC.

In our town, which has a large Indian population, kids were missing a month a year for family trips to India, and then the parents expected the schools to \"catch the kids up\".

They probably missed 3 weeks out of 13 years of school for trips.", "I am pro homeschooling (as an option, not a mandate) and pro vacation/family time, but deliberately keeping your kids out for the first few weeks of school is problematic. First off it could sabotage their social lives since a lot of the other kids will have started forming friendships by then, so it can be harder for them to find someone available to buddy with. Secondly it makes it harder for the teacher because (especially at the younger ages) the first couple weeks are less about the academics and more about kids adapting to their new class environment; where to line up, what order things get done in, getting to know everyone's names, start-of-year handouts for the parents, how to raise hands before speaking, etc. A latecomer often needs extra attention from the teacher to catch up on all that, and the student is at a higher risk of getting scolded for mistakes in week 3 or 4 that would have been easily forgiven in week 1.", "My sibling lives in the UK and convinced their kid's head of school to approve US Thanksgiving as a day off for \"religious reasons\". This also resulted in the kid's primary school doing a lesson on Thanksgiving in the early years & doing the typical American Thanksgiving themed arts & crafts as part of that lesson which was super amusing.

Some other decent points about the importance of the *first* weeks have been raised in other comments, but beyond that I don't think a couple weeks is any great loss. \n\nThe problem, as I see it, is that expectation that it's on the school to 'catch the kids up' as you said. That's the parents job, but if you take the coursework with you, it shouldn't be that difficult, especially in kindergarten.", "Yeah, your points about missing the *first* weeks causing extra havoc make sense.
