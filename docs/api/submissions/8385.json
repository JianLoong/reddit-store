My colleague, Mrs. Smith, asked why I couldn't do it, and I said, \"Because I'm an unrelated man.\" She made a weird face at me but eventually said, \"fine\" and went to go get Nadia. When she came back, she was not at all polite when she said, \"It's fixed.\" I thanked her and tried to brush off her attitude, and I asked Nadia to stay back a moment after class, just long enough to apologize if I embarrassed her.

But next time, ask a female student and don't disrupt another class.\n\nI bet Nadia's parents will appreciate that you were trying to be respectful", "Good intentions, bad outcome. Maybe attending the training will help you in the future understand how to handle that situation better. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s truly better to admit ignorance and ask clarifying questions to avoid that mistake. \n\nApologize to those you offended and explain that you wasn\u2019t sure how to react. However, you meant no disrespect to the girl or her religion.", "Soft YTA. You brought in another person, interrupting their work, to let a student know about a minor wardrobe malfunction, therefore embarrassing her with a stranger. All you had to do was quietly get her attention and touched your head. Otherwise, ignore it. She'd have figured it out. You were in a room full of students. There would have been nothing improper about it. You decided to go about it in the most embarrassing way you could, aside from pointing and yelling.", "Soft YTA because you didn't mean to be TA. I don't get why you panicked and disrupted another class over this. It's Nadia's responsibility to deal with her own religious adherence. What would have happened in a classroom where the teacher didn't know this detail about the student's religion? Probably nothing. You created a huge awkward situation unnecessarily. I know you think you were doing the right thing but frankly your behavior just seems weird and over the top. Her parents may find it invasive.", "NTA\n\nNot sure what's going on here.

Different people observe different degrees of strictness in covering their hair, and it may have been a case where this wasn't actually an issue for Nadia.", "YTA your response is so weird. you\u2019re acting like she was shimmying at the class with naked breasts.  Hijabs slip sometimes, they get adjusted, it\u2019s not a big deal.", "NTA. You were considerate. Your colleague sounds ignorant.", "NTA\n\nYou acted on principle and went along with what traditional Muslims would have considered to be a proper practice. When I went to high school we had a majority Muslim population and a lot of people that observed Hijab. I never remember an instance of a Hijab coming off but had that occurred I would have reacted the same way. Had this student come from a more traditional household the embarrassment that could have occurred in this situation would have been pretty bad.\n\nI think you acted on the assumption that this was the case and in doing so erred on the side of caution, which is always best practice in a potential situation involving a sensitive topic like religious practice. \n\nYou may still receive some blowback because of these actions, but morally speaking you acted in the correct way and in a way that you felt was best to accommodate the student.", "YTA. It's not your job to make sure her head is covered to comply with her religion. I get that your intentions were good, but you seriously overstepped. Especially interrupting another teacher during class over this girl's hair showing? Nadia could figure that out for herself. Stick to teaching class.", "I'm gonna go with a YTA.

Period. The end.\n\nMy bet is the principal & other teacher do not understand the gravity of the situation. I also believe this was misunderstood by her parents and/or the Principal asked the parents to come to the school. Not vice versa. \n\nIf it is anything else, OP, explain the above and how your motivation was to treat this with the utmost respect possible. You\u2019ll be fine.

My husband actually called one in our area to ask a honest question and they were very happy to provide information to someone who was just trying to be respectful.  What it all comes down to here is that you were doing your very best to respect your student and her beliefs--maybe the situation wasn't as serious as you thought it was, but you did the best you could, given that you are not of her faith and cannot be expected to have the all-details understanding and knowledge of a co-religionist.", "YTA.

You corrected a student for a dress code infraction that you would have tolerated in a non-Muslim student.\n\nIt was also sex discrimination. You refused to have a conversation with a student that you would have had if she were a man (or you were a woman). Doing this escalated the situation considerably and made it impossible to pass off as an informal conversation.\n\nAnd I also happen to think you engaged in parenting that was not your role.

The only one responsible for how they choose to practice their religion is Nadia.", "She probably felt more unconfortable with the drama OP pulled off though.", "Muslims are not a hivemind that all practice their religion in the exact same way.", "That's not respecting the girl's religion, that's respecting the *parents'* religion. The *girl's* religion is to be little bit more lax or careless. And there is a difference.", "Irrelevant. What if there weren't a convenient female teacher next door? OP is there to do a job, not palm off parts of it to his colleagues.", "It's not the same, but I grew up around some fundamentalist groups with similar veiws. I know how something similar would be seen, and that OP drew unnecessary attention to a personal issue.\n\nETA: I have had some exposure to Muslim culture and the hijab. I also know teenage girls.", "My read was that she didn\u2019t know it had slipped and would have been embarrassed if a man pointed it out, not that he was trying to make sure she was doing what she was supposed to.", "Maybe Nadia was thinking they were able to relax somewhat in Amira's absence and OP has ensured it will get back to Amira.", "I\u2019m Muslim and if a male teacher had pulled me aside to tell me my hijab was messed up, I might\u2019ve been embarrassed but not upset with the teacher", "It\u2019s very diverse where I live and I know lots of Muslim people and they are ALL different, with different approaches to their religion. It makes more sense to ask than assume anything.", "Yeah, it feels like he\u2019s aware it\u2019s an issue but isn\u2019t sure if it\u2019s a \u201cwhoopsie!\u201d or like something really awful that\u2019s going to ruin her life if a male comments. And he assumed the latter, which is probably unintentionally racist, then went overboard trying to help. Probably the best thing would have been to ignore it totally and let her figure out herself and pretend he never saw, the second best thing would be a note. But assuming her parents are reasonable people, the meeting will hopefully be a good thing to help him and other teachers understand how best to respond to stuff like that without overreacting or being inconsiderate", "Why did he have to point anything out? He could have left her be.", "I'm saying that YOU are xenophobic to assume that all Muslims punish women for religious infractions, not OP.", "This is a completely incorrect analogy. He was attempting to protect her by letting her know her religious attire was not properly hiding her hair - something that could have caused her problems with her family if her friends or siblings at school at seen it and reported it to their family. There can be severe consequences for these girls.", "i don\u2019t agree that he should have interrupted her class but he was trying to do the right thing", "He was being respectful. He was not regulating her dress code. He asked the female teacher next door to assist as unrelated males are not allowed to view women\u2019s hair if they wear hijab. \n\n[Source](https://www.al-islam.org/tags/hijab)\n\nTrust me. My youngest (15) goes to a school where teachers there attempt to embarrass her and her friends constantly via a dress code violations. This is not that.", "Nope. No one, especially me, said that all Muslims practice the same way. Please do your research before you slam strangers on the internet. \n\nYou\u2019re from Winnipeg looks like. 1.7% of the total population are Muslim.\n\n[Source](https://canadapopulation.org/winnipeg-population/)\n\nWhere I have lived the % is significantly higher. I first learned about the Muslim religion in college through Muslim friends. Prior to the pandemic, I mentored women at University from 2013-2019 with 25% or so identifying as Muslim. My knowledge isn\u2019t from a white person\u2019s perspective, either.", "To conflate these things shows how little you understand the deep value certain spiritual practices have for practicing religious people.", "Unless he had knowledge that she wanted to be that strict or the parents were, he is imposing his idea of her religion on her. It's weird. Who knows how religious she is.", "Accommodations for religious beliefs often require gendered aspects. I don\u2019t agree with it fundamentally, because I think it reinforces weird purity culture taboos, but you either respect them or you don\u2019t. But truthfully, if a female student needs help in the girls locker room they don\u2019t send in a male gym teacher, even in your most stereotypical homogeneously Christian/secular school.", "Yeah. It\u2019s not the same and it\u2019s very apparent. Just say no next time. Stop acting like an authority in something you have zero experience with because the misinformation is infuriating. There are Muslims who don\u2019t want to wear the hijab and are pressured and might wear it loosely for that or other reasons when away from family, but if Nadia\u2019s hair is always covered this was most likely something she was grateful to be told about before more men could see her hair. \u201cI also know teenage girls\u201d wtf is this drivel.", "That was my impression too. OP wasn't so much policing as he didn't want to make Nadia uncomfortable by being the one to point it out but knows it's important to her.  The meeting does sound like a good idea so that OP knows how to handle it next time, Maybe if Amira isn't there, Nadia has another friend in class who can point it out to her quietly, but better to have everyone on the same page for how to handle this.   OP probably shouldn't directly mention it, so I think his instincts were good, and he's just unsure of what to do here.", "Because other male students could probably see her hair, which he thought could possibly be very upsetting to her. The sooner he helps her cover her hair, the possibility less men would\u2019ve seen it.", "I was responding to the previous poster above me who stated that the student would/would not be punished in her community for this!", "Oh come on, OP is presumably not a teacher in Saudi Arabia. There is no need to assume that her family is abusive because of her religious adherence.", "I'm not disagreeing with bringing it to her attention. But he chose to do it in a way that almost guaranteed it would become public. He left his class unattended to get another teacher (who had to leave her class unattended, which would be noticed) and pulled the girl out of his class (which would be noticed). 2 classes were affected and could easily draw the conclusion that the girl was the cause of the disruption. And since the female teacher formally complained about it, the matter was brought to the girl's parents. So how was he protecting her?", "Which he apparently completely missed doing, since he has a meeting with the teacher, parents, student, and principal to discuss why his actions were wrong.", "FYI not all Muslims practice like this, and the website you are quoting is from a certain branch/view of Islam not universally shared. Just as not all Jews are orthodox, not all Christians are evangelical. Just ask women in Turkey and Tunisia. The lady didn't need anyone, male or female, policing her hijab. She probably gets told what to do more than enough as it is.", "OMG the hijab is not universal, it's become mainstreamed because of the views of some very vocal clerics, the growing influence of Saudi Wahabism and general growth of Islamic conservatism. Please stop getting your info from the internet and extrapolating it out into absolutes.", "Understood. But Nadia and the parents have complained about OP's behavior.", "So how far do you think OP should go while policing his students' religious practices? If Nadia were eating pork should he grab it from her and throw it out? If he had a gay student in his class from a Conservative Christian family, should he out the student to their family?", "I think you are ill informed if you think honor killings, forced marriages and physical punishments for lack of modesty or perceived disobedience only happens in Saudi Arabia. It happens in every developed country including the USA and all over Europe.", "And yet she told him she was ok with it. Most likely because she may come from a family where exposing her hair would be considered immodest and have consequences. I do not know where this is taking place but in parts of France or Belgium for examples muslim girls cannot wear even a modest below the knees skirts because of consequences from boys who assume they are sluts. Depending on where this is taking place he did what was most respectful and safe for her.", "i agree that the way he did it was wrong but his intentions were right which makes him NTA", "You\u2019re so right and these people don\u2019t even realize. \n\nIf this is America, let\u2019s say the child was doing that on purpose and wants to explore freedom outside her religion. Lets say the parents kids are on your side and get the other teacher to drop then charges or whatever they\u2019re called and you don\u2019t get in trouble.\n\n\nOP You\u2019re still the asshole in this case. Do you deny it ?", "Incorrect. Mrs. smith complained and notified OP of the meeting. There is zero indication Nadia or her family instigated this.", "He **isn\u2019t policing his student** He is being respectful not to bring attention directly to her as a male teacher in a class with other UNRELATED MALE STUDENTS so as not to disrespect her religion. \n\nGiven by the looks of your 19 day old throwaway Reddit account, you are on here to give people the most shit possible. I am here for the exact opposite reason.", "I would say that if she was eating a piece of ham and it was reasonable to assume she knew it was pork he should stfu. But if it was some kind of unidentifiable meat situation (hello, school lunches), then it might be ok to let her know that there was pork in it as long he made sure she understood that he wasn\u2019t judging her or trying to tell her what to do. It\u2019s a fine line and maybe he shouldn\u2019t say anything unless he had some rapport with her and knew she would want to know.", "What else could she say? He was a male in charge. \n\nSome info: I grew up around some very fundamentalist Christian offshoots. I had friends who were the children of members. Showing too much anything would get them in trouble. Having a teacher kick up a fuss over a wardrobe malfunction would be just about the worst thing that could happen. Even if they were trying to fix it.", "Intentions don't matter much when faced with the consequences of actions. There's a well known phrase about good intentions paving the road to Hell.", "He did single her out and bring attention to her by having the other teacher remove her from the class to fix it.", "He actually is policing his student. Perhaps without her cousin there she didn\u2019t mind some of her hair showing. You don\u2019t know her intent either.", "Well, I am in France and teachers here have been killed and assaulted over perceived cultural offenses and not by fundamentalists Christians.  I think your read over this situation is not quite as informed as you may think. I support what this teacher did and I understand his sense of panic over what to do. Depending on where he is the consequences to him could have been deadly.", "he will get punished almost certainly but that doesn\u2019t mean he should. instead he should be taught what he did wrong and how to fix this in the future", "I did not know the situation was so tense there, sorry. That does change things.", "When I was growing up, public school and boarding school was extremely well integrated and we all played together - all  races and religions but I was in a \"good\" neighborhood. I think there was always tension in the poorer suburbs with social housing. Today, there are problems across all strata of society unfortunately which affects the more modest classes more because the schools are overwhelmed and have less means to address issues. The issue of the hijab on school is a recurring question at election as the country wants to eliminate all religious signs in the hopes of keeping religion out of school. it isn't working."]}
