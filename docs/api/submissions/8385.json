I panicked and looked away as soon as I realized. I would have asked Amira to take Nadia into the office between my classroom and my female colleague's next door to fix it. But without Amira there, I ended up ducking into my colleague's classroom and disrupting her class (I waited until she acknowledged my presence and then waved her over to speak to her quietly) to ask her to please bring Nadia into the office to fix her head covering and I would keep an eye on her class. My colleague, Mrs. Smith, asked why I couldn't do it, and I said, \"Because I'm an unrelated man.\" She made a weird face at me but eventually said, \"fine\" and went to go get Nadia. When she came back, she was not at all polite when she said, \"It's fixed.\" I thanked her and tried to brush off her attitude, and I asked Nadia to stay back a moment after class, just long enough to apologize if I embarrassed her. She said it was fine and left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got home at 3:30, but at 6 pm I got a call from my principal, Mrs. Waters, outside of working hours telling me that Mrs. Smith had complained about my unprofessional conduct regarding Nadia and that I am expected to attend a meeting on Monday with her, Mrs. Smith, Nadia, and her parents to discuss what should be done about my actions. I asked what I had done wrong; she refused to elaborate beyond \"unprofessional conduct\". I told her I expected my in-building union representative to be present at the meeting, or I would not go, and she said she would email our building rep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel ambushed.

But next time, ask a female student and don't disrupt another class.\n\nI bet Nadia's parents will appreciate that you were trying to be respectful", "Good intentions, bad outcome. Maybe attending the training will help you in the future understand how to handle that situation better. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s truly better to admit ignorance and ask clarifying questions to avoid that mistake. \n\nApologize to those you offended and explain that you wasn\u2019t sure how to react. However, you meant no disrespect to the girl or her religion.", "Soft YTA. You brought in another person, interrupting their work, to let a student know about a minor wardrobe malfunction, therefore embarrassing her with a stranger. All you had to do was quietly get her attention and touched your head. Otherwise, ignore it. She'd have figured it out. You were in a room full of students. There would have been nothing improper about it. You decided to go about it in the most embarrassing way you could, aside from pointing and yelling.", "Soft YTA because you didn't mean to be TA. I don't get why you panicked and disrupted another class over this. It's Nadia's responsibility to deal with her own religious adherence. What would have happened in a classroom where the teacher didn't know this detail about the student's religion? Probably nothing. You created a huge awkward situation unnecessarily. I know you think you were doing the right thing but frankly your behavior just seems weird and over the top. Her parents may find it invasive.", "NTA\n\nNot sure what's going on here.

Different people observe different degrees of strictness in covering their hair, and it may have been a case where this wasn't actually an issue for Nadia.", "YTA your response is so weird. you\u2019re acting like she was shimmying at the class with naked breasts.  Hijabs slip sometimes, they get adjusted, it\u2019s not a big deal.", "NTA. You were considerate.

When I went to high school we had a majority Muslim population and a lot of people that observed Hijab. I never remember an instance of a Hijab coming off but had that occurred I would have reacted the same way. Had this student come from a more traditional household the embarrassment that could have occurred in this situation would have been pretty bad.\n\nI think you acted on the assumption that this was the case and in doing so erred on the side of caution, which is always best practice in a potential situation involving a sensitive topic like religious practice. \n\nYou may still receive some blowback because of these actions, but morally speaking you acted in the correct way and in a way that you felt was best to accommodate the student.", "YTA. It's not your job to make sure her head is covered to comply with her religion. I get that your intentions were good, but you seriously overstepped. Especially interrupting another teacher during class over this girl's hair showing? Nadia could figure that out for herself. Stick to teaching class.", "I'm gonna go with a YTA.

Period. The end.\n\nMy bet is the principal & other teacher do not understand the gravity of the situation. I also believe this was misunderstood by her parents and/or the Principal asked the parents to come to the school. Not vice versa. \n\nIf it is anything else, OP, explain the above and how your motivation was to treat this with the utmost respect possible. You\u2019ll be fine.

You could ask for their input, both to help you address this occurrence and for guidance in the future.  My husband actually called one in our area to ask a honest question and they were very happy to provide information to someone who was just trying to be respectful.  What it all comes down to here is that you were doing your very best to respect your student and her beliefs--maybe the situation wasn't as serious as you thought it was, but you did the best you could, given that you are not of her faith and cannot be expected to have the all-details understanding and knowledge of a co-religionist.", "YTA.

You corrected a student for a dress code infraction that you would have tolerated in a non-Muslim student.\n\nIt was also sex discrimination. You refused to have a conversation with a student that you would have had if she were a man (or you were a woman). Doing this escalated the situation considerably and made it impossible to pass off as an informal conversation.\n\nAnd I also happen to think you engaged in parenting that was not your role.

Your principal will have a problem.  \n\nIf your principal is a competent, principled (heh) administrator, then she will understand that your colleague is the problem.  If your principal has been promoted beyond his or her ability, they'll perceive you as the problem.

I suspect you will be fine. An update would be appreciated.  \n\nPersonally, I think the only asshole here is your colleague.  She didn't have the situational awareness to understand why you would choose to enlist her help in the first place and when you explained it to her she was unpleasant, chose to perceive your concern as an imposition and escalated to the principal without talking to you first.  If she isn't an actual asshole in her day to day interactions with you, other staff and her students, then at the very least she is unprofessional and maybe isn't very thoughtful about or attentive to the thousands of things that we as teachers do in our practice  when we're not assuring our children that the mitochondria is, in fact, the powerhouse of the cell.\n\nI don't know if you overreacted. \n\nI am an American teaching in Singapore.  I interact with a lot more observant Muslims than you do. I find if I act with kindness and with good intentions, I can expect the same from reasonable people.

A discreet  little tug close to the temple has always been sufficient in my practice to let a student or colleague know to adjust their hijab.  There are also women in my school that I don't know well enough to feel comfortable telling them their hair is showing.

Yay teaching. \n\nFinally, there's a lot of bad faith in this thread.  Most of it is rooted in ignorance, some of that willfull, lots of it spiteful.

You did make Nadia more of a spectacle amongst her peers than if you had dealt with it yourself - instead of it being something and nothing, both classrooms of children will be aware that something went on and because the other teacher spoke to Nadia and you asked Nadia to stay behind, everyone\u2019s going to know it\u2019s about her. You might as well have painted a sign on her back. Asking her if she\u2019s ok and apologising *if* you embarrassed her, doesn\u2019t really help after the fact and you have far more power than Nadia does - girls are socialised to say things are ok whether they are or not, and if she had said you deeply offended her and hurt her feelings and she didn\u2019t accept your apology what would you have done?

He should have spoken to another student in the classroom or given her a slight gesture to let her know. OPs intentions were good, but I think the situation could have been handled differently. His current attitude could potentially end up isolating them from other students and making friends. Children quickly pick up differences and OP is currently reinforcing them, and it's debatable whether that is in a healthy/ unhealthy way.\n\nI also think it is important to have the meeting so OP and the family can decide how to address this going forward. I think the way OP is handling it is a little extreme because he is overly concerned about not being offensive \u2014 enough so he does not feel comfortable informing the student himself. I think it'll be good for him to put some boundaries and protocols in place so everyone feels more comfortable. \n\nI can understand 100% why the other teacher was annoyed and think her feelings are justified as well. Teaching is difficult and disrupting a lesson means there is a potential that the other students miss their learning. Once you, and your students come out of the flow, it's hard to get back into it. This situation is also outside the schools and staffs norm. OP shouldn't beat himself up it's a learning curve for everyone.\n\nI work in education, in the UK, and think your school should have an unspoken protocol/ staff meeting on this. Religious sensitivity and inclusion are important but disrupting others' lessons shouldn't be the new norm. NAH.", "Jumping on this to add that I think OP's intent was honourable - it came from a genuine desire to respect Nadia. If I were OP, I'd go into the meeting and ask Nadia and her parents how they would have liked him to handle it. Chances are, they'll be totally fine with how he did - but it's always best to have an open mind and heart and be willing to listen and learn. Take your cue from them OP.", "If Nadia and her parents are in the meeting, then Nadia might have had an issue she was not comfortable bringing up.\n\nI'm not an authority on the Muslim religion, but I have had friendly working relationships with several Muslim women, one was a pretty good friend.. I don't think showing a bit of hair on the forehead is  something that would require you averting your eyes, running from the room and getting assistance for her. That is a ridiculous overreaction to a girls forehead. I'm sure she's been wearing the hijab long enough she can adjust it for herself.\n\nYou're her teacher, if you were concerned all you had to do was mention it to her, and she would have fixed it herself. If it was even an issue for her. Muslim women don't always have their hair completely covered by the hijab, many wear it pulled back a bit. She's a person who happens to Muslim, you don't have to scared to interact with her. If her parents were concerned about her interacting in public with males not related to her she would not be going to your school. Just don't be in a room alone with her.\n\nYTA, not a huge one but you could have handled this simply and better. She's your student you are allowed to talk to her.", "The other teacher whose class was interrupted because he couldn\u2019t tell Nadia to go to the bathroom? He couldn\u2019t have written a note telling her to go into the office and fix it? \n\nThe other teacher whose class is now being supervised by another class\u2019 teacher while she has to walk a student from his class into the office? With a student she very possibly doesn\u2019t know at all? \n\nIf Nadia\u2019s religion forbids her from interacting with a man to this extent, her parents need to homeschool her. \n\nYeah his conduct was extremely unprofessional.", "Question, why was getting a female teacher the right thing to do? Because you can't have a man acknowledge/mention that your hair is showing? Or to go with her to fix it?", ">Hijab slipping is not a big deal, not something that would traumatize and humiliate the wearer.\n\nUnlike the case of having some random other teacher come in to class and single her out in public about not having her rig on square. She may know OP meant well, but she's still a Teenager and so primed to be humiliated by being called out or made a spectacle.", "Yeah these were also my thoughts. I'm sure his intentions were good but I actually had to read the post back when he said he \"panicked\" because I thought I'd missed that he was Muslim too. Why is he panicking? Definite overreaction", "How is it not a wardrobe malfunction? It wasn\u2019t doing it\u2019s job of covering her hair thus it malfunctioned.", "My exact thoughts! Huge overreaction on his part", "Exactly! Perhaps Nadia told the female teacher that her hair showing didn't bother her? Maybe that's why the teacher was so snappy with him, and why she complained", "Noticed this too! \ud83d\udc40", "I feel like the female teacher walked into the classroom shouting for Nadia instead of being discreet.", "But Nadia is more than capable of adjusting her own hijab and determining whether it comports with how she wants to present herself. \n\nWhy is OP taking it upon himself to alert her if some hair is showing?\n\nIf her underwear were showing, would a teacher take it upon himself to alert her to that fact?", "It's about our devotion to our faith. If something is lacking and we don't notice it, the best thing you could do is to kindly tell us, which is exactly what OP did", "I remember being on a meeting once in a booth in an open area. One of the girls had a wedgie which showed off her entire ass to everyone! \n\nThere were 8 other people around and NOBODY had noticed. I quietly messaged someone who she liked that I was close too to look out for her and go on guard duty and I looked away. \n\nIs that an apt comparison of handling it correctly? I\u2019m sure the girl would have been mortified to realise she had shown a lot of skin to me and instead lives in peaceful ignorance of that fact.", "Meanwhile I'm over here thinking why would I care if my bra strap was showing at all, it's just part of a piece of clothing, it's not like my boob is hanging out. Everyone's different I guess", "Why is she an AH for being upset that her class was interrupted for a situation that had no relevance to her, and that wasn\u2019t her responsibility? It\u2019s extremely unprofessional of him to assume she can just stop teaching to go deal with his student because he\u2019s afraid to interact with her and can\u2019t solve the problem on his own. Disrespectful to his colleague and her students. \n\nHe could have written the girl a note. He could have told her to go to the bathroom. He could have sent her with another female student. There were multiple options available that did not require him to remove instruction from another class.", "The other teacher only went after asking OP why he couldn't do it. I think they come off as very annoyed at the whole thing.", "Completely agree! I\u2019m like what did I miss here\u2026 It said she had some hair on her forehead right? Did I miss the part where her titty popped out? LMAO!!\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude02", "I\u2019d much rather hear it from a man, if the option is him running to get a woman to say it to me.", "I'm not sure if I would prefer my male teacher to go get a female teacher to tell me on his behalf. I'm not commenting on the hijab situation, but just in this scenario it wouldn't help. Not having a guy involved would be great, but not having a whole big deal made of it would be more important.", "Yeah she gave me \u201cnot my problem\u201d with eye roll vibes \n\nOp is NTA he was trying to be considerate.", "Regarding the underwear analogy\u2026 He might have a female teacher let her know to help her avoid further embarrassment in front of more people.", "thank you. Reddit can be really helpful to see different perspectives.", "Not necessarily - plenty of women wear their styles in ways that still show some hair or ears or neck. It's case by case by person, not a blanket statement on how all Muslim women wear it", "There is no violation of the laws of god, since there is no god.", "I faced similar situation when working with a Muslim coworker. She was a bagger and I was the cashier. I scan some pork and I didn\u2019t know what kind of extent she follow through her religion if she able to touch pork. I put them side and bag them without causing a ruckus. After finishing with the customer, I talk to my coworker if she able to touch pork. She said yes.\n\nI would have done same thing but talk her if I made her uncomfortable.", "He wasn\u2019t \u201cafraid,\u201d he was simply respecting her religion. The fact that there is no established processes or training in this school to handle situations that solve these problems respectfully is on the administration. That person should be the one the complaint is lodged against, not OP. I agree putting extra burden on female teachers due to sexist religious practices is problematic, but that doesn\u2019t make him TA here\u2014 it\u2019s the administration that didn\u2019t set this up properly.", "Even if Nadia wasn't concerned, OP still has to consider what her *parents* might think of such interactions as well.  OP would be in just as much trouble if they'd done something the student was completely comfortable with but that her parents were deeply unhappy about and then they'd contacted the principal citing religious intolerance etc.\n\nFar wiser to err on the side of caution in the initial incident (which OP did), and then ask the student and parents what their preferred action would be in the future if anything like that happened again.\n\nSince it was the other teacher that complained, I'm guessing that Nadia and her parents didn't have a problem with what happened (or at least not a big enough problem to contact the school that afternoon).  Based on what was described here, I think OP should do some homework on common-place knowledge around Muslim customs regarding head coverings and take along a basic 'info packet' to counter what is probably either complete ignorance or outright religious animosity on the part of the other teacher.", "Why was the other teacher a nitwit for being angry that some other teacher demands that she leave her class unattended for several minutes to deal with this situation that is in no way her responsibility? Why isn\u2019t she allowed to be upset for her 30 students who missed instructional time because OP wanted to make it clear how \u201crespectful\u201d he is of the \u201cexotics\u201d?", "This feels like nitpicking. Yes I said bathroom instead of office and escort instead of bring, but the point stands. This was completely unnecessary hubbub and most likely against professional standards. The student could have felt pressured, confused, or uncomfortable when a teacher suddenly appeared and asked her to come out of class. OP will find out the issue at the meeting, bringing a union rep is a great idea. I certainly understand OP\u2019s intent was well meaning but that doesn\u2019t always mean it was the best course of action.", "So blatantly sexist...", "A calm person could just have carried on teaching the class without making a scene.", "He was afraid. He \u201cpanicked\u201d as soon as he realised. \n\nHe was trying to score woke points.", "I agree.  If the OP doesn't know who the Muslim student's friends are.  I had a Muslim friend in school who wore a veil.  She was pretty popular though.  I know I would have said something to her as well as many of her other friends.  This girl may not have many friends.", "To give a better idea of this than \"fixing a haircut\" it's more like her bra was showing. Not a strap but like a cup or part of one. Our her underwear. It's really inappropriate for an unrelated male to bring it up. If she is someone who buys into the reason for covering her head, that is. And OP has to assume she is.", "Haircut? Ummm not even close...teacher, teach thy self?", "Let's just say the only AH here was the other teacher for overreacting. OP did mean well in an unfamiliar situation. Maybe he didn't handle it perfectly but at least he cared enough about his students religious background to help them with something they might not have noticed. If I was in OPs shoes I would have written something on a paper and either give it to her while patrolling the class or let her come to the teachers desk and let her read it there real quick to get as little attention as possible to her. If a annoyed teacher comes in and asks for her, then obviously all (including male) eyes will be on her.\n\nOr maybe she doesn't wanna fix it in the first place in a act of rebellion", "100%. If people in a secular society need special accommodations for their religion then it is their responsibility to ask for it. I\u2019ve known several Muslims with very different levels of adherence to their religion. \n\nAll of these posters who say, \u2018Islam says this so the Muslim in question must be expected to adhere to it\u2019 apparently haven\u2019t met alot of Muslims outside of their bubble.\n\nHere\u2019s an example of how this could be a problem. A male college professor may avoid mentoring a promising hijabi student for fear of violating her religion even if she would have no issue with it and would have wanted it.", "Take it up with Islam then", "There aren't mate. Even in the most fundamental of families the most you'd get is a stern warning. \n\nAnd please don't bring up Iran, Islam there is too intertwined with politics and removing the hijab is seen as a threat to the state and the leaders", "Typo is all I can think for calling it a haircut eek.", "I have in no way said he should be disciplined. I\u2019m not sure where you\u2019re getting that. I think the school needs a policy based on community input ASAP, I think the teachers need training to best meet the needs of a changing student population, I think OP should definitely bring their rep to the meeting. I also think that whatever the meeting is about the student deserves to be heard and centered in the conversation. OP feels blindsided, asked what the issue could be, and as a former teacher in a few diverse communities I put my two cents in. I think it\u2019s NAH for the record.", "I honestly think it\u2019s quite possible NAH. The other teacher may have been upset about being suddenly pulled out of their class in the middle of teaching for a non-emergency, as a woman they may have realized this course of action would bring even more (male) attention to the student. Anytime a teacher leaves the room suddenly, and then another teacher appears and asks a student to follow them kids tend to get rowdy. We just don\u2019t know. This meeting may be happening because the student\u2019s parents asked for it. Just because a student tells you something is \u201cfine\u201d in the moment doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t go home in floods of tears. I don\u2019t think OP is TA but I think the school needs to do some training.", "I wouldn\u2019t have left my classroom. I would have told OP where to go. Loudly. He had no right to disrupt the learning of another class when no one was injured or in a medical emergency.", "That\u2019s still an area of the world where you can be killed to showing your hair. Due to Muslim doctrine. \n\nThe fact that it\u2019s intertwined with politics has no bearing on it being relevant to the conversation. Religion has long been utilized to oppress the masses, but the fact it\u2019s used as a tool doesn\u2019t mean that the tool itself is above reproach.", "Oh fair point. I\u2019m going to hope that\u2019s what it was!"]}
