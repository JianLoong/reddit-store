My colleague, Mrs. Smith, asked why I couldn't do it, and I said, \"Because I'm an unrelated man.\" She made a weird face at me but eventually said, \"fine\" and went to go get Nadia. When she came back, she was not at all polite when she said, \"It's fixed.\" I thanked her and tried to brush off her attitude, and I asked Nadia to stay back a moment after class, just long enough to apologize if I embarrassed her.

But next time, ask a female student and don't disrupt another class.\n\nI bet Nadia's parents will appreciate that you were trying to be respectful", "Good intentions, bad outcome. Maybe attending the training will help you in the future understand how to handle that situation better. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s truly better to admit ignorance and ask clarifying questions to avoid that mistake. \n\nApologize to those you offended and explain that you wasn\u2019t sure how to react. However, you meant no disrespect to the girl or her religion.", "Soft YTA. You brought in another person, interrupting their work, to let a student know about a minor wardrobe malfunction, therefore embarrassing her with a stranger. All you had to do was quietly get her attention and touched your head. Otherwise, ignore it. She'd have figured it out. You were in a room full of students. There would have been nothing improper about it. You decided to go about it in the most embarrassing way you could, aside from pointing and yelling.", "Soft YTA because you didn't mean to be TA. I don't get why you panicked and disrupted another class over this. It's Nadia's responsibility to deal with her own religious adherence. What would have happened in a classroom where the teacher didn't know this detail about the student's religion? Probably nothing. You created a huge awkward situation unnecessarily. I know you think you were doing the right thing but frankly your behavior just seems weird and over the top. Her parents may find it invasive.", "NTA\n\nNot sure what's going on here.

Different people observe different degrees of strictness in covering their hair, and it may have been a case where this wasn't actually an issue for Nadia.", "YTA your response is so weird. you\u2019re acting like she was shimmying at the class with naked breasts.  Hijabs slip sometimes, they get adjusted, it\u2019s not a big deal.", "NTA. You were considerate. Your colleague sounds ignorant.", "NTA\n\nYou acted on principle and went along with what traditional Muslims would have considered to be a proper practice. When I went to high school we had a majority Muslim population and a lot of people that observed Hijab. I never remember an instance of a Hijab coming off but had that occurred I would have reacted the same way. Had this student come from a more traditional household the embarrassment that could have occurred in this situation would have been pretty bad.\n\nI think you acted on the assumption that this was the case and in doing so erred on the side of caution, which is always best practice in a potential situation involving a sensitive topic like religious practice. \n\nYou may still receive some blowback because of these actions, but morally speaking you acted in the correct way and in a way that you felt was best to accommodate the student.", "YTA. It's not your job to make sure her head is covered to comply with her religion. I get that your intentions were good, but you seriously overstepped. Especially interrupting another teacher during class over this girl's hair showing? Nadia could figure that out for herself. Stick to teaching class.", "I'm gonna go with a YTA.

Period. The end.\n\nMy bet is the principal & other teacher do not understand the gravity of the situation. I also believe this was misunderstood by her parents and/or the Principal asked the parents to come to the school. Not vice versa. \n\nIf it is anything else, OP, explain the above and how your motivation was to treat this with the utmost respect possible. You\u2019ll be fine.

My husband actually called one in our area to ask a honest question and they were very happy to provide information to someone who was just trying to be respectful.  What it all comes down to here is that you were doing your very best to respect your student and her beliefs--maybe the situation wasn't as serious as you thought it was, but you did the best you could, given that you are not of her faith and cannot be expected to have the all-details understanding and knowledge of a co-religionist.", "YTA.

You corrected a student for a dress code infraction that you would have tolerated in a non-Muslim student.\n\nIt was also sex discrimination. You refused to have a conversation with a student that you would have had if she were a man (or you were a woman). Doing this escalated the situation considerably and made it impossible to pass off as an informal conversation.\n\nAnd I also happen to think you engaged in parenting that was not your role.

No idea how you misread it this badly.", "The ways actual Muslims in the comments appreciate this but the actual white saviors are the people insisting this was wrong  of him to do \ud83d\ude2d I can\u2019t with y\u2019all today", "I guarantee the family were only told after the coworker told the principal and chances are Nadia's family will defend and thank him for being considerate enough for their practices.", "I don\u2019t get the sense the student and parent are calling the meeting, they\u2019re being invited to the meeting by the principle to discuss the matter. And if they\u2019re of devout faith I\u2019d be surprised if the parents didn\u2019t appreciate the consideration at the least. Maybe they will say it\u2019s not a big concern, but I\u2019d be highly surprised if they\u2019re upset at OP and would 100% read that update.", "As a teacher myself, any teacher who takes any given moment of their class as so important that to leave it for a moment is neglection is absurd.\n\nSchools work best when teachers work as a team not a bunch of individuals on an island, especially  not in today's education situation.\n\nOP waited respectfully, just as he respected his student. I probably would of just asked the student with my eyes kinda away if it were me, but I'd also hope my classroom neighbors would be there for me for way more than this. \n\nNow OP did leave out context of say was the other teacher in the middle of a fairly involved lab or something, but even still for her to take this level of action is borderline unprofessional and shes deff an ahole", "OP explained the demographic of his school. Do you really think that another student would be best to support? Teens are kinda cruel and love to tease other kids for anything. If he had asked a student (which would have been inappropriate anyway) for help with this, it could have been used as fuel to tease Nadia and her cousin.", " Would I have felt awkward? Yeah probably tbh. I PERSONALLY wouldn\u2019t have minded you letting me?", "Honestly you are very wrong, this is what's known as an unexpected situation and those happen. It's easy to be respectful and kind but harder to be bitter. \n\nYou'd like to be respected? Well so would Nadia and apart of that is showing compassion to her religion", "Kind of feel like this is the only comment that matters in the whole thread. I do get people are trying to be nice? Progressive? in some weird way but they\u2019ve really missed the mark in accusing OP of doing something wrong and thoughtless instead of extremely thoughtful. The white knights calling him a white knight without checking in with even a single hijabi person before proclaiming on their behalf\u2026 yall.", "The other teacher needs training not OP", "Yeah but the parents are coming in for some reason.", "> And also there was no reason to assume that she can\u2019t be with an \u201cunrelated man\u201d just because she is Muslim.\n\nIslam forbids unrelated people of the opposite sex to be alone together.  Since the student is a hijabi, there is every reason to assume she wouldn\u2019t be comfortable alone with OP.", "It's a well known fact that unrelated men 1 cannot see their hair 2 be alone with an unmarried Muslim woman. \n\nNotifying native could of resulted and her crying as most Muslims take their religion very seriously. \n\nI've seen women soccer players surround another player mid game to protect her while she fixed her head scarf.", "OP thought Nadia would be embarrassed to know that some of her hair was showing, and want to discreetly cover it quickly. Kinda like you tell someone if their fly is down before others notice.", "bro what? u have no idea what ur talking about", "What are you talking about?", "Is the teacher allowed to ask her questions in class?", "They've also never minded when our male friends pointed it out.", "I don't think I misread it that bad. It's actually very simple. \n\nEither it's just a simple accident and you can either inquire if she meant it that way or wishes to go fix it. \n\nOr it's bad enough that it warrants interrupting the next door class to get a female teacher because the purity itself of the girl is at stake.\n\nSo if you answer option 2 then you agree that schools should apply religious rules without caring if the student even wants to follow it. Because what happened here is a female teacher singled out a student and told her to fix her clothing which was in no way breaking any rules of the school but was not respecting a religious rule.", "yeah and as someone with a masters in Ed who works in a poor diverse area, I'm just scrolling through these going wtf.  \n\n\nWhen in doubt support the student to the max until given a reason explicitly not to. Worst case OP causes an absolutly MINOR disruption to the teachers class. Like people acting OP asked the teacher to leave her class on a field trip hours away. Grow up, no moment of any class is critical, pacing has modularity to it, etc\n\nPeople are also not realizing how much caution a male teacher has to have when dealing with girl students, ESPECIALLY if it involves an element of privacy with them. That's something I enjoy about my current district, they make me feel like they start from a position of my corner a bit instead of damage control, but I still meet with any girl students after class by the table right next to my open door, just again no reason to noe ensure ZERO chance or doubt of any thing that shouldnt happen. \n\nANDDD this teacher makes me so mad because she's everything wrong with Ed and OP everything right. He's putting his student's needs first to the best of his ability. If I was him I would of talked to the other class while there and made it not 100% lost time if it lingered but even if it was, HER CLASS IS NOT THIS IMPORTANT to justify all this for one moment, anddd they teach at the same institution as part of the same community, she should see Nadia as her student too, and OP as her teammate she's happy to support. Like aghhhh ahaha", "Probably because they were called.  OP says that the principle told him on the phone that she was calling the meeting because Mrs. Smith (the other teacher) complained, not the parents or the student.", "I know I certainly would've.", "If she consistently wore hijab covering her hair it\u2019s reasonable to assume that\u2019s what she prefers to do. He let her know as a FAVOR based on his belief of what she wanted - not on behalf of Islam as some wahhabist mullah. He was not imposing any consequences so it\u2019s straight up stupid to call it enforcing a religious rule. Actual Muslim women in the comments are grateful for his consideration but then we have to read this junk that implies you\u2019ve never met a hijabi woman in your life.", "In what world do you live where there's a shortage of female teachers?", "Palm off \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4d", "That was my interpretation as well.", "Yeah I could see that and hope that\u2019s the case but you never do know.", "Personally I agree because of the intention but i also think someone who covers for modesty would appreciate a non Muslim man knowing of and respecting the intent of it, even if the scenario with the other teacher was clunky.", "he doesn\u2019t know much about the religion except that women\u2019s hair should be covered and men shouldn\u2019t see it.", "But in the event that she believes a stricter interpretation, then having a woman notify her is safer than a man asking, no?", "But you make big assumptions on her religious practice. \n\nI dont think we need to make assumptions on how embarrassing it is for a teenager to be pulled out in the middle of class. \n\nOne is a maybe. The other is a surely.", "Are you hijabi? All that I\u2019ve spoken to about this post disagree.", ">He let her know\n\nThat's the thing, he didn't. He went and got a female a teacher to order the student to fix her clothing. Noone checked if she was finewith some hair showing, she was ordered to fix it. \n\nYes woman who wear hijab normally wear ot to hide their hair, but there are more than 1 way to wear a hijab. Since you like assumind instead of asking then why not assume that this was an experiment from the girl to express herself. Maybe free herself a bit. \n\nNow that girl knows that if she ever needs help with her home life and religion then she better not go to those two teacher.", "r/boneappletea", "I think OP has limited experience/understanding of muslim religion/culture. He was doing his best to be understanding and non-threatening/offensive.", "There\u2019s no reason to assume that without anyone sharing that information.\nThere are very puritan christians that don\u2019t allow unrelated men to accompany girls, but we don\u2019t assume that for every christian we meet right. \n\nThe child and her parents are aware there is a male teacher and could have requested any rules like \u201ccan\u2019t walk her to the office alone.\u201d But he should really just be going by school policy.", "The meeting being brought by the female teacher, and more than likely not the family considering Nadia's reaction afterwards.", "I get that. But disrupting two classes and pulling her out of class defenetly must have been embarrassing to a teenager. \n\nI will take the \"could *maybe* be upset depending on religious individual practice we dont know about\"  over the \"defenetly was embarrassed by teacher in front of a bunch of teenagers\".", "I\u2019m sure she\u2019s had her hijab slip in the past. She would have realized eventually, been a bit embarrassed, and fixed it. OP could have quietly let her know, or, better yet, just minded his own business. Instead he interrupted two classes and most likely embarrassed this young girl. His behavior was totally over-the-top and ridiculous.", "Honestly as other Muslims/hijabis have agreed here, he\u2019s actually put MORE thought and consideration into the premise of Muslim practices than any of these other asshole teachers at his school or frankly many of the commenters here. It\u2019s ok that he was a little overly cautious since some wouldn\u2019t mind a heads up from a man based on his good intentions. But my SIL won\u2019t even shake my partners hand and we\u2019re basically family lmao. He was reasonable to err on the side of caution.", "But that\u2019s not the premise of a specific religious belief. The vast majority of Muslim women who wear hijab do follow the practice of not showing their hair to non mahram men. Assuming someone hijabi, with their hair always covered in public, DOESNT follow that is such a weird way to approach this. It feels totally disingenuous to argue that you should be assuming the exception when that has much more potential to be disrespectful of their religious practices.  EG, when people assume I don\u2019t eat pork because my family is still Muslim, I always appreciate their cultural consideration even though I fucking love bacon.", "Yup. The murder of 16 year old Aqsa Parvez of Ontario, Canada in 2007 was acknowledged as an honor killing. It\u2019s largely believe she was killed by her father and brother due to her refusal to wear the hijab.", "He is not the asshole. The teacher that brought in parents without consulting Nadia on whether she wanted her family involved would be the asshole.", "I get where you\u2019re coming from but it can go both ways. People are allowed to be offended if others assume things about their practices, even if well intended. Especially if it singles them out. \n\nAnd it\u2019s appropriate for the school to have ground level expectations of behavior (like walking your student to the office if needed), and for that to be followed unless requested otherwise. OP was definitely well intended but did make assumptions.", "But she didn\u2019t say she was offended when he checked in with her. The other non Muslim teacher was the one who made a complaint and told him about the meeting. Ugh, this comment section is infuriating."]}
