I panicked and looked away as soon as I realized. I would have asked Amira to take Nadia into the office between my classroom and my female colleague's next door to fix it. But without Amira there, I ended up ducking into my colleague's classroom and disrupting her class (I waited until she acknowledged my presence and then waved her over to speak to her quietly) to ask her to please bring Nadia into the office to fix her head covering and I would keep an eye on her class. My colleague, Mrs. Smith, asked why I couldn't do it, and I said, \"Because I'm an unrelated man.\" She made a weird face at me but eventually said, \"fine\" and went to go get Nadia. When she came back, she was not at all polite when she said, \"It's fixed.\" I thanked her and tried to brush off her attitude, and I asked Nadia to stay back a moment after class, just long enough to apologize if I embarrassed her. She said it was fine and left.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI got home at 3:30, but at 6 pm I got a call from my principal, Mrs. Waters, outside of working hours telling me that Mrs. Smith had complained about my unprofessional conduct regarding Nadia and that I am expected to attend a meeting on Monday with her, Mrs. Smith, Nadia, and her parents to discuss what should be done about my actions. I asked what I had done wrong; she refused to elaborate beyond \"unprofessional conduct\". I told her I expected my in-building union representative to be present at the meeting, or I would not go, and she said she would email our building rep.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI feel ambushed.

But next time, ask a female student and don't disrupt another class.\n\nI bet Nadia's parents will appreciate that you were trying to be respectful", "Good intentions, bad outcome. Maybe attending the training will help you in the future understand how to handle that situation better. \n\nSometimes it\u2019s truly better to admit ignorance and ask clarifying questions to avoid that mistake. \n\nApologize to those you offended and explain that you wasn\u2019t sure how to react. However, you meant no disrespect to the girl or her religion.", "Soft YTA. You brought in another person, interrupting their work, to let a student know about a minor wardrobe malfunction, therefore embarrassing her with a stranger. All you had to do was quietly get her attention and touched your head. Otherwise, ignore it. She'd have figured it out. You were in a room full of students. There would have been nothing improper about it. You decided to go about it in the most embarrassing way you could, aside from pointing and yelling.", "Soft YTA because you didn't mean to be TA. I don't get why you panicked and disrupted another class over this. It's Nadia's responsibility to deal with her own religious adherence. What would have happened in a classroom where the teacher didn't know this detail about the student's religion? Probably nothing. You created a huge awkward situation unnecessarily. I know you think you were doing the right thing but frankly your behavior just seems weird and over the top. Her parents may find it invasive.", "NTA\n\nNot sure what's going on here.

Different people observe different degrees of strictness in covering their hair, and it may have been a case where this wasn't actually an issue for Nadia.", "YTA your response is so weird. you\u2019re acting like she was shimmying at the class with naked breasts.  Hijabs slip sometimes, they get adjusted, it\u2019s not a big deal.", "NTA. You were considerate.

When I went to high school we had a majority Muslim population and a lot of people that observed Hijab. I never remember an instance of a Hijab coming off but had that occurred I would have reacted the same way. Had this student come from a more traditional household the embarrassment that could have occurred in this situation would have been pretty bad.\n\nI think you acted on the assumption that this was the case and in doing so erred on the side of caution, which is always best practice in a potential situation involving a sensitive topic like religious practice. \n\nYou may still receive some blowback because of these actions, but morally speaking you acted in the correct way and in a way that you felt was best to accommodate the student.", "YTA. It's not your job to make sure her head is covered to comply with her religion. I get that your intentions were good, but you seriously overstepped. Especially interrupting another teacher during class over this girl's hair showing? Nadia could figure that out for herself. Stick to teaching class.", "I'm gonna go with a YTA.

Period. The end.\n\nMy bet is the principal & other teacher do not understand the gravity of the situation. I also believe this was misunderstood by her parents and/or the Principal asked the parents to come to the school. Not vice versa. \n\nIf it is anything else, OP, explain the above and how your motivation was to treat this with the utmost respect possible. You\u2019ll be fine.

My husband actually called one in our area to ask a honest question and they were very happy to provide information to someone who was just trying to be respectful.  What it all comes down to here is that you were doing your very best to respect your student and her beliefs--maybe the situation wasn't as serious as you thought it was, but you did the best you could, given that you are not of her faith and cannot be expected to have the all-details understanding and knowledge of a co-religionist.", "YTA.

You corrected a student for a dress code infraction that you would have tolerated in a non-Muslim student.\n\nIt was also sex discrimination. You refused to have a conversation with a student that you would have had if she were a man (or you were a woman).

Your principal will have a problem.  \n\nIf your principal is a competent, principled (heh) administrator, then she will understand that your colleague is the problem.  If your principal has been promoted beyond his or her ability, they'll perceive you as the problem.

I suspect you will be fine. An update would be appreciated.  \n\nPersonally, I think the only asshole here is your colleague.  She didn't have the situational awareness to understand why you would choose to enlist her help in the first place and when you explained it to her she was unpleasant, chose to perceive your concern as an imposition and escalated to the principal without talking to you first.  If she isn't an actual asshole in her day to day interactions with you, other staff and her students, then at the very least she is unprofessional and maybe isn't very thoughtful about or attentive to the thousands of things that we as teachers do in our practice  when we're not assuring our children that the mitochondria is, in fact, the powerhouse of the cell.\n\nI don't know if you overreacted. \n\nI am an American teaching in Singapore.  I interact with a lot more observant Muslims than you do. I find if I act with kindness and with good intentions, I can expect the same from reasonable people.

A discreet  little tug close to the temple has always been sufficient in my practice to let a student or colleague know to adjust their hijab.  There are also women in my school that I don't know well enough to feel comfortable telling them their hair is showing.

Yay teaching. \n\nFinally, there's a lot of bad faith in this thread.  Most of it is rooted in ignorance, some of that willfull, lots of it spiteful.

You did make Nadia more of a spectacle amongst her peers than if you had dealt with it yourself - instead of it being something and nothing, both classrooms of children will be aware that something went on and because the other teacher spoke to Nadia and you asked Nadia to stay behind, everyone\u2019s going to know it\u2019s about her. You might as well have painted a sign on her back. Asking her if she\u2019s ok and apologising *if* you embarrassed her, doesn\u2019t really help after the fact and you have far more power than Nadia does - girls are socialised to say things are ok whether they are or not, and if she had said you deeply offended her and hurt her feelings and she didn\u2019t accept your apology what would you have done?

He should have spoken to another student in the classroom or given her a slight gesture to let her know. OPs intentions were good, but I think the situation could have been handled differently. His current attitude could potentially end up isolating them from other students and making friends. Children quickly pick up differences and OP is currently reinforcing them, and it's debatable whether that is in a healthy/ unhealthy way.\n\nI also think it is important to have the meeting so OP and the family can decide how to address this going forward. I think the way OP is handling it is a little extreme because he is overly concerned about not being offensive \u2014 enough so he does not feel comfortable informing the student himself. I think it'll be good for him to put some boundaries and protocols in place so everyone feels more comfortable. \n\nI can understand 100% why the other teacher was annoyed and think her feelings are justified as well. Teaching is difficult and disrupting a lesson means there is a potential that the other students miss their learning. Once you, and your students come out of the flow, it's hard to get back into it. This situation is also outside the schools and staffs norm. OP shouldn't beat himself up it's a learning curve for everyone.\n\nI work in education, in the UK, and think your school should have an unspoken protocol/ staff meeting on this. Religious sensitivity and inclusion are important but disrupting others' lessons shouldn't be the new norm. NAH.", "Jumping on this to add that I think OP's intent was honourable - it came from a genuine desire to respect Nadia. If I were OP, I'd go into the meeting and ask Nadia and her parents how they would have liked him to handle it.

That is a ridiculous overreaction to a girls forehead. I'm sure she's been wearing the hijab long enough she can adjust it for herself.\n\nYou're her teacher, if you were concerned all you had to do was mention it to her, and she would have fixed it herself. If it was even an issue for her. Muslim women don't always have their hair completely covered by the hijab, many wear it pulled back a bit. She's a person who happens to Muslim, you don't have to scared to interact with her. If her parents were concerned about her interacting in public with males not related to her she would not be going to your school.

Perhaps (and just perhaps) without her sister there, she was \"testing the waters\" and seeing how it might be to expose more hair. Now, she believes the school is \"enforcing\" her dress code.

You made assumptions about her based on her religion. Many young American Muslim women are constantly being reminded of their otherness.

We have quite a few Muslims here in Germany with most females not wearing anything but those that do wouldn't have been weirded out by a man just telling them discretely that their gear became a bit loose.

If he was asked to do the same: stop his class, leave his class, and have an uncomfortable conversation with a male student he has no relationship with because the other teacher isn't comfortable just because he's a man, I don't think he would be happy either. \n\nI also noticed he didn't find out what the policy was afterwards. He was panicked enough to handle the issue in the moment but clearly it has happened before (normally I would ask the other student to help) and he hasn't tried to figure out the policy or the best way to handle it.

When I was a senior, one desperate teacher even pulled me aside to tell a 6th grader she had gotten her period. So awkward.\n\nNow, OP knows enough to have that there\u2019s a rule about unrelated men and exposed hair, but he obviously doesn\u2019t have any practical experience or he wouldn\u2019t be questioning his behavior. While perhaps there is a perfect way to handle this issue, I think OP tried to pick the solution that best fit the rules in his head -> young teenage girl + issue of modesty = seek nearest adult female.  It felt to me like the other teacher would have acted differently if it had been a societal taboo that she understood - like exposed underwear.  Right or wrong, that\u2019s how I ended up thinking she behaved poorly.\n\n\nRandom Note: I know that many men are perfectly comfortable and capable of handling issues of modesty with teenage girls. The most gracefully protective nurse I ever had (growing up in and out of hospitals) was a guy.

Some of the fabrics that are trendy to wear rn are damn near impossible to keep from slipping. Hijabis know this. \n\nIf she hadn\u2019t noticed, it\u2019s not a big deal. She adjusts, and moves on with her life. \n\nI personally think OP had his heart in the right place. How \u201cNadia\u201d felt about would vary depending on the way the female teacher approached her, and whether she cared enough that some hair was showing. \n\nEither way, it\u2019s not like OP insulted her just by noticing hair. It happens. Hijabis deal with way worse from people who truly mean harm", "I don't think it's a matter of him having seen her, he looked away immediately.  He could have called up one of the other female students and quietly asked her to tell her, but he went to get another adult.  There were some options, sure, but that was his snap decision.  There was no \"perfectly correct\" situation, only a handful of problematic ones.  He tried to be respectful of her, so he doesn't fall into latter", "\u201cIf Nadia felt singled out\u201d but we don\u2019t know that yet because they haven\u2019t had the meeting\u2026 if she felt bad in the moment, I\u2019m sure her parents and maybe later she would \u201cfeel overly thankful \u201c at a thought that someone was so considerate to her religious beliefs , they took the time to attempt to do the right and learn from it if it wasn\u2019t. If you don\u2019t know and all you\u2019ve ever heard was how sacred the hijab was and your a person that has respect for all faiths you go off the basic knowledge he had at the time.( which was show respect and no unrelated male should look upon her to protect her \u201cmodesty \u201c. \nAll Muslims just like every other religion has varying degrees of devoutness .\nHe will not know how he should have behaved in that moment because they haven\u2019t had the meeting yet and he has not lived that experience before. \n\nAs to your other point I would much rather either a friend told me I had something in my teeth or at least the same sex. I personally would prefer that. But having something in my teeth does not have the same religious significance tho does it?", "I do agree that OP is being thrown under the bus. Someone should have said something more regarding the issue prior to the meeting.", "I have been a teacher, and any time a student is asked to a meeting with faculty for any reason such as this, even if just to get the student's perspective on a specific incident, the parents were to be notified and were welcome to join for the meeting if they desired. Kind of like OP has the right to a union rep, students have the right to have their support systems available in a meeting to ensure their perspectives are being appropriately regarded and respected.", "It is but it\u2019s not\n\nSometimes, in some places, parents and children are called in without being the ones to raise the issue", "When I was in highschool it was required I have a parent there with me if I was seen by school administrators. Even when it was something minor. Only happened twice, but the school called them in essentially to cover their asses. It was district rules. Kind of like you can't question a minor without an adult present.", "I am aware of that. The fact that OP was called unprofessional and the student is being brought in at all (along with inviting parents) paints a pretty clear picture.\n\nOP needs his union rep.\n\nIt's weird that so many people are trying to say this is normal. I think OP meant well, and I don't know enough about religion to say much more on the situation, but it is pretty clear that the student was offended and OP should prepare himself."]}
