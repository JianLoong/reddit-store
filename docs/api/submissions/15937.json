You're right about needing new friends. You have things going on in your life and it isn't your friend's place to judge. You said happy birthday, atleast you thought of them in this tough time.", "I am sorry for your loss. (Hugs.) A pet is a family member in my experience. So, this is a non sequitur. The death of family actually makes partying a non option for lots of people.\n\nHer birthday is just not anything I can wrap my mind around as being important to you under these circumstances.

Are you okay? Animals are family I\u2019d be devastated if anything happened to my elderly dog or my 1.5 year old cat. You\u2019re not being selfish you should be taking all the time you need.

I missed a family Thanksgiving with my fiances side for my cats death. Not only is it insensitive to expect you to attend a celebration while in mourning, but why would anyone want someone crying about a death at their birthday?", "I had to put down my dog two weeks ago due to old age as well as being sick on and off. It was cruel to keep her alive for my selfish benefit. It still doesn\u2019t make the pain I\u2019m going through better. And you know what? Everyone in my life has been super understanding. \n\nYes you need better friends and definitely NTA.", "NTA. You 100% need new friends.

Find people who will treat you with the kindness you deserve - it isn\u2019t this person(s). It\u2019s not easy, but you can do it.

My dog is my best friend and the people who know me know how important she is to me. I feel pretty sure that my friends will be there for me when she passes. At the very least they would surely understand if I had to cancel plans to take time to grieve such a big loss. Sorry your \"friend\" sucks. I hope you ditch her and find people who will be there for you when you are down rather than kick you and make you feel even lower.", "NTA, you deserve better friends", "I'd text back: Thank you for supporting me through my horrible grief and sorrow.

I give you props OP. Keep your head up and that positive outlook and you will make it through this. My heart goes out to you. Please let me know if you need anything. Your cat will forever hold a special place in your heart. As for your partner be glad you found out now rather than later on. Doesn\u2019t make it easier but it could always be worse.

Sorry for the loss of Phantom, he did sound really cool.", "NTA. Yeah, get some new friends, but maybe this one is the only one you need to lose. \n\nWeird for them to be so angry about this. Might be some mental health issues on their side.", "NTA, and that friend needs to be a ex-friend. I absolutely **despise** having to alter or cancel plans for any reason, yet every single time a friend has lost a pet I've been nothing but empathetic and sympathetic to them, because it's a pain I've gone through enough times myself to know it never gets easier.", "NTA\n\nThat isn't a friend.

You have no obligation to attend a birthday party.  Dealing with your own grief and taking care of yourself is important.

If you want, you could share a picture of Phantom for us to miss him with you. He sounds like he was a wonderful companion to you.

You\u2019re not being selfish. Geez people have birthdays every year and guess what, it\u2019s just a damn day that means literally nothing to anyone else. \n\nI\u2019m really sorry about your cat. Even when they are old and we know they will go soon, it leaves  a huge hole in our heart. I\u2019m not sorry about the ex though, sounds like an AH too and you\u2019re better off without these AH\u2019s. I\u2019m sure Phantom is on your shoulder right now loving you as he always does. And he wants you to have better friends too.", "NTA.  If/when my cats go, there will be very little I\u2019ll be doing for a few days.  Also, that\u2019s shitty about your boyfriend - you deserve to take the time you need to.  And honestly, going through that, it\u2019s hard to fake hapoy, and I bet if you\u2019d gone and been down, she\u2019d of been pissed about that too.\n\nHugs to you, friend.", "Our kitties are so special. I'm so very sorry for the loss of your family member, and that your so-called friend is willing to put a minor social obligation (presumably there will be plenty of other people at the party) above your grief.

I\u2019m sorry about your losses.  Internet hugs.\n\n2.  Any alleged \u201cfriend\u201d with zero sympathy, zero empathy, zero tact is not the type of human you need right now.  I\u2019ve always thought more of my cats than I do most people.  \n\n3.  I do know how you feel, to a certain degree.  Four years ago, I buried a 13 year old cat that I\u2019d raised since he was a baby and a husband I\u2019d had for 25 years.  These two deaths occurred four months apart.  My own sister got offended because I grieved the cat \u201cmore than I should have because it was just a cat.\u201d \n\nThe best thing you can do is take care of yourself, physically and mentally, and ignore your \u201cfriend\u201d until you feel you are ready to deal with her callousness again, if you ever do.", "Sooo sorry for the cat.\n\nSounds like she has main character syndrome too, lol\n\nIf you went there and somehow got trigger and cried, she would have blamed you too for making her birthday about you.\n\nYou are in a lose-lose situation no matter what you choose.\n\nYou need new friends 100%!!!", "NTA.

Any response from your 'friend' that was not along the lines of \"I'm so sorry to hear that, let me know if you need anything\" means it's time to find new friends. \n\nIf you're up for it, post what she said on social media and put her on blast so you can A) publicly shame this bi$h and B) see if there are any friends in the group worth keeping :)", "Wow... NTA at all, I'm sorry for your loss, Phantom sounds like an awesome little dude.", "NTA dang. Adult birthdays are ok to miss. If a friend couldn\u2019t celebrate my birthday with me because they had to deal with their trauma I\u2019d be totally ok with that and leave an open ended invite to celebrate the life of their cat and their newfound freedom with them instead.

It's gonna hurt like hell for a long time but it does get easier.", "NTA! I lost my amazing cat a year ago, and I was devestated. I can't even imagine going through a breakup at the same time.

You're right, you do need new friends.\n\nAlso I'm so sorry for your loss", "NTA, but be sure to text her back something like \u201cI hope your birthday is shit actually, bye\u201d.
