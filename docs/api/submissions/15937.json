He used to sit on my shoulder while I read and wrote things and shit. He was very cool.\n\nSo anyway, I was meant to go to a friend's birthday party and get drunk and shit tomorrow, but I sent her a text about an hour ago that read: \n\n\"Hey [friend], sorry to drop this on you right before your party, but I've been dealing with a whole lot, I just broke up with Mason (my ex), and Phantom just passed away this morning. I'm not gonna be able to make it to your birthday, as I need some time to myself. I hope you understand. Have a happy birthday!\"\n\nI thought that was the end, but I got back an entire wall of text saying that im being selfish and making everything about me and my quote \"Cat that is dead anyway\".\n\nI'm 99% sure I need to find new friends, but I'm just wondering if I went about it the wrong way.

Take care of yourself first and foremost. Your friend is obviously not a real friend in the truest sense of the word. Do yourself a favor and seek new ones elsewhere.", "NTA\n\nEven if your friend was disappointed, he could have just said that. \"Wall of text\" usually means someone is overcompensating when they know they're wrong.\n\nBig break-ups and a long-time pet death = not in the mood for celebrating.\n\nMy guess is the birthday \"friend\" doesn't have a lot of friends (wonder why?) and instead of being understanding, is being a jerk. Just withdraw from this friendship. I'm sorry for all you're going through.", "NTA - How old are you?

Sorry you're going through such a difficult time right now but consider rethinking who your friends are.", "NTA. I am an adult who found it very hard to function when my dog passed. Take care of yourself, and although there is no replacing Phantom, a new pet will give you a small reason to smile again, which helped me immensely!", "NTA. Enough suffering to be excused.", "NTA at all. The title was enough for me (I've had a gf who needed to do that--her friends were fine with it, as one should be). But also a breakup?! Yeah, get new friends.", "NTA. I'm not a pet person and I can perfectly understand how sad is losing your cat. That friend really don't deserve your time, she is at top an acquaintance", "NTA and I'm very sorry for your loss. It's so hard to say goodbye to our pets, the grief and loss are for real. Phantom sounds like an exceptionally sweet kitty, and I hope you can find some comfort in the good memories of him.", "NTA. You can drop the 1% and absolutely get new friends if this is how they are.", "NTA! That\u2019s a lot, and you need better friends!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You're right about needing new friends. You have things going on in your life and it isn't your friend's place to judge. You said happy birthday, atleast you thought of them in this tough time.", "I am sorry for your loss. (Hugs.) A pet is a family member in my experience. So, this is a non sequitur. The death of family actually makes partying a non option for lots of people.\n\nHer birthday is just not anything I can wrap my mind around as being important to you under these circumstances. Grief takes precedence over partying.\n\nSo, she can grow up and get a grip. NTA. Your friend is a yuuuuge one, though. Give yourself a break from this childish selfishness.", "Your (hopefully ex)friend is an asshole for what they said about your cat. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss, OP. NTA.", "NTA It's clear that your friendship with this person isn't one.", "Normally I'd say once you make a commitment, stick with it.

Are you okay? Animals are family I\u2019d be devastated if anything happened to my elderly dog or my 1.5 year old cat. You\u2019re not being selfish you should be taking all the time you need. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through all this at once. I\u2019m sorry you also have to now lose people you thought were your friends.", "Nta , ditch the \" Friend \"", "NTA\n\nI'm so sorry about Phantom. \n\nYour text explaining why you would not be at the party was perfectly worded. Your \"friend\" is the ahole! Personally had I gotten the text you sent I would've been on the phone to you checking if you were okay and if there was anything I could do for you.", "NTA.  friends should understand and be supportive when you're going through a rough time.  and even if they don't understand, they shouldn't be mean about it.  sorry about phantom :(", "Pets are family,and anyone with a soul grieves when they die. I dread the day I start losing my three seventeen year-old cats.\n\nYou're absolutely NTA, and should probably think about why you're friends with someone so obviously selfish and heartless.", "NTA holy shit. very sorry to hear about your cat. i'm a pet person so i completely understand how pets can feel like best friends or family and losing them can leave you with a hole in your heart that can take years to heal. the breakup and being cheated on is hurtful enough without having to mourn your cat. your friend was cold and unempathetic and i agree--you need to find new friends.", "Nta. I missed a family Thanksgiving with my fiances side for my cats death. Not only is it insensitive to expect you to attend a celebration while in mourning, but why would anyone want someone crying about a death at their birthday?", "I had to put down my dog two weeks ago due to old age as well as being sick on and off. It was cruel to keep her alive for my selfish benefit. It still doesn\u2019t make the pain I\u2019m going through better. And you know what? Everyone in my life has been super understanding. \n\nYes you need better friends and definitely NTA.", "NTA. You 100% need new friends. An actual friend would be understanding and wouldn\u2019t throw a tantrum over a birthday party attendance. Sorry for your kitty. He\u2019s playing across the rainbow bridge now.", "NTA. Find people who will treat you with the kindness you deserve - it isn\u2019t this person(s). It\u2019s not easy, but you can do it. Phantom was undoubtedly the best boy, and I am so sorry for your loss. Will you be OK for now? Please take care of yourself.", "I'm so sorry that you lost your cat. NTA. My dog is my best friend and the people who know me know how important she is to me. I feel pretty sure that my friends will be there for me when she passes. At the very least they would surely understand if I had to cancel plans to take time to grieve such a big loss. Sorry your \"friend\" sucks. I hope you ditch her and find people who will be there for you when you are down rather than kick you and make you feel even lower.", "NTA, you deserve better friends", "I'd text back: Thank you for supporting me through my horrible grief and sorrow. I really, really appreciate your kindness, consideration and empathy.", "Couldn\u2019t have said it any better. I hope life gets better for you soon", "Hey, shit happens. I try to just take life as it comes. I'm really sad about my cat and losing my partner, but all I can really do now is move forward, find someone new, and honour the memories I had with my cat.", "Mourning multiple things at once isn\u2019t easy. I give you props OP. Keep your head up and that positive outlook and you will make it through this. My heart goes out to you. Please let me know if you need anything. Your cat will forever hold a special place in your heart. As for your partner be glad you found out now rather than later on. Doesn\u2019t make it easier but it could always be worse. You will find someone who treasures you and will give you unyielding loyalty. Your person is still out there \ud83d\ude42", "Me and my wife have three cats between us and if one of them were to die and anyone of our friends were not mature enough to understand the pain of losing a pet, it\u2019s time to find new friends and cherish the memories of your pet who would have loved you more than that friend ever could."]}
