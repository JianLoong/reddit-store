She\u2019s just moved to a country she\u2019s literally never stepped foot in before. She\u2019s left behind her friends, her home, her school. For most children this is one of the biggest upheavals they\u2019ll ever have been through.\n\nNow, on her first day in an entirely foreign country she\u2019s served a food she\u2019s never eaten before (you say curry - was it spicy by any chance?), that is likely very different from what she\u2019s used to. She doesn\u2019t want to eat it, and she asks for SOMETHING familiar on the middle of all this new. And instead of responding with some amount of compassion or understanding, you berate her. She then tries to quietly ask to escape an upsetting situation, you force her to share her words, and then you further berate her and step completely out of your role by trying to decide how she should be parented.\n\nYour granddaughter is adrift right now. You could support her and endear yourself forever, or you can continue down this path and be the person who\u2019s house she dreads coming to. YTA - think about what kind of relationship you want.", "YTA\n\nFirst off, not your kid, and you don't get to parent her. Secondly, if this is the first time she's eating something, and she tried it and she doesn't like it, do you purpose letting her go hungry?", "Wow, what a way to welcome your grandchild. YTA.", "YTA.\n\n>I was very offended by her behaviour and told her she is being rude and told her to finish her food.\n\n>She then started whispering in my son's ear which I again found very offensive I told her that she needs to say it out loud because that behaviour is very offensive.\n\n>I was fuming. I told my son that he needs to discipline that child\n\nRead these again slowly and carefully. What else could you be?", "YTA, I'm sorry to say. You can't expect a little kid who is used to certain foods to immediately like a food that's foreign to her.  The important thing is that she tried it. Forcing her to eat food she doesn't like helps nobody.  Then she knew that what she was thinking might offend you, so she whispered it to her father. You insisted that she tell you, then got angry at her for telling you. That's just wrong.\n\nBe kinder and more welcoming to her and she'll love you. Be rule-bound and authoritarian, taking the natural actions of a child as personal affront, and you will lose this opportunity.", "YTA...While she may need a little training in the manners dept....she is not your kid and it is not your job to treat her like that. \n\nIt is her dad's job to decide if her behavior is appropriate, not yours. \n\nKids do not typically like curry unless raised with it, and maybe her whispering was to spare your feeling, or maybe she was scared of the big, bad tyrant that told her she was bad.", "YTA. This is not your child, it's your son's daughter. You should had ask your son if she liked curry or not. Give her something else that she can eat.", "This has to be fake. \n\nBut if not, YTA for bullying your granddaughter at your first meeting. It's likely you'll never see your son or his family again.", "YTA. People are allowed to dislike foods.\n\nLet's say you invite a friend over. You serve a dish they are unfamiliar with. They taste it and do not like it. Would you really say to your guest \"Well, you can't have anything else!\" \n\nMy parents served curry and as a child and I didn't like it. Far too spicey (maybe that's an issue for this child?). So I ate the rice that came with it, and the other toppings that were served (raisins, coconut, etc; it was fun). They didn't insist I had to have the curry and nothing but. And there were other things to eat, so nothing had to be prepared separately.\n\nMost meals aren't one single thing. I would imagine there was something else you were serving with the meal and you could've given the child that.\n\nYes, she needs to be told you don't just spit out food like that. Whispering is rude too. But you pushed her to be honest about what she said and she was. So you can't complain about that.\n\nYour son is right, the whole issue could've been avoided if you just gave her something else.", "Hahahahahahaha. I love your granddaughter's confidence in calling out your unreasonable behaviour. Your son has raised her well.\n\nYTA", "*You* think that your curry is delicious. Has the child grown up eating curry? Or is she possibly used to a different style of food having grown up in a different country?\n\nYou are indeed an asshole for assuming that you should run roughshod over another human being's preferences. She might not like curry. She might not like *your* curry. But you do not get to piss and whine that someone - a child! - didn't like food that you chose for them without being an asshole.\n\nIf you want to ensure that she won't want to spend time with you as she growns up, of course, you're doing a stellar job.\n\nYTA.", "YTA.\n\nI know \"back in your time\" that's what people did, but now, the behavior you are trying to force on your son is the fast track to having kids who hate/resent you when you get older.\n\nIf you want to not have a relationship with your son/grandchild, by all means continue this behavior.", "YTA. \n\nI'm 48 years old and I hate eggs. I wish I didn't, it would make life SO much easier but it is what it is. You could make eggs so delicious that everyone else in the world would love them but I'd still hate them. Your grand daughter apparently hates curry. There's nothing wrong with that. Instead of recognizing that, you doubled down and insisted that *YOU* are right, that *YOU* get to decide what everyone likes.\n\nYour grand daughter even tried to be polite and complain directly to her father without bothering anyone else and you *STILL* insist that she's wrong.\n\nYou're wrong lady and if you keep this up, you're going to lose her, your son, and others in that family.\n\nYou need to grow up.", "YTA and judging by the comments you don't seem to care.  You need to reevaluate your attitude and behaviour appropriately or you aren't going to see your Grandchild anymore.", "YTA - you cooked food she has never had in her life in a country she has never been in her life.   \n She gave you the respect of trying it out and discovered that she doesn't like it.  She is not your child meaning you don't get to TELL her what to do.  They are GUESTS in your home.  Way to make a first impression, OP.  The world has changed.  You need to get with the times.", "You aren't really curious whether or not you're the AH, are you? You aren't actually reflecting on your behavior. You are already convinced that you are right and everyone else is wrong.\n\nLet's look at the facts and remove the emotional response. Your son and daughter just move to a new country with new customs and food. You feed daughter a heavily-spiced dish that she's never had before. She doesn't like it and doesn't want to eat it. She spits it out. You yell at her and try to force her to eat it by saying she isn't allowed to eat anything else. She tries to speak quietly to her dad about your behavior. You call her rude and demand to know what she said. When she repeats it out loud, you continue to call her rude and demand her dad punish her.\n\nDid I get that right? Let me explain something to you. People don't have to eat things they don't like. Children who are living in a new country are often exhausted from culture shock and may behave erratically. Although spitting out food is not appropriate, neither is yelling at a child when she is clearly hungry and out of sorts.\n\nYou handled this poorly. You could have asked her Dad to fix her something else, and then addressed the spitting situation later. YTA. But you don't care, because you think it's appropriate to berate your grandchildren for not liking curry.", "YTA - Fuck every single person who forces children to eat things they dislike. \n\nWhat do people like you get out of this type of abuse?", "YTA\n\nDon't ask if you don't want to know.\n\nAlso, this kid has had her whole life uprooted. Maybe you could try a little compassion, ask her what she likes and dislikes. Try to actually build a relationship with her. You might find that she is a smart, honest, forthright, amazing person. She might be a lot like you.\n\nYou are the adult - it is up to you to try to build this relationship. Wouldn't you be sad if she just spends all her time hiding from you?", "Yta so she tried something new and didn't like it? And instead of being chill about it, you pretty much guaranteed that she will now hate your curry forever.  Good job.", "Well you asked for it and she gave it to you. I don't like curry either so I understand her. And YES YTA for thinking her likes and dislikes are something you can change simply by saying \"eat it\". They really should stay in a hotel.", "YTA It's his kid not yours. He is her parents and will decide what's best for her, if he wants to make new food let him. What if someone forced you to eat something you really don't like or do something you don't want to. Instead of pushing them both away try to find common ground and build a better relationship with both of them.", "YTA - kids taste buds are not developed at this age. Tastes can be strong and offensive, especially if new. Studies show they need to taste food at least 12 times before they like it. It\u2019s biological. It\u2019s designed for us to not eat poisons by mistake, and eat familiar foods. So giving her a new dish she\u2019s not had before, and expecting her to eat all of it, and calling her rude for not wanting to, is just bashing your head against a wall and souring your relationship with your grandchild because she\u2019s clearly used to more freedom of choice regarding food, which is due to the parenting choices of your son and her mother. Blaming her is ridiculous.\n\nGiving kids freedom around their food, how much they eat and what they eat, by offering a variety of foods that are nutritious at meal times that they can select from, means less eating disorders, more intuitive eating, less anxiety and more variety in their diet overall.", "Just all around, YTA\n\nI don't know if the kid spit the food onto the plate or into a napkin, but I can see that if it was onto the plate, it was impolite. \n\nHowever, when you're not accepting that the child doesn't like your food, why do you expect the child to talk to you? You already said no, and you're no one to her. Obvious next option is to ask the person she knows.\n\nKids are not going to eat the food you put in front of them just because you say so. You did that with your kids, fine, but this child was not raised that way. She has been raised to ask for something different. At least she asked and didn't demand and throw a fit.\n\nAs far as discipline, that's up to her parents, not you. Again, they raised her to say she didn't like food, so why would they punish her for that?\n\nHopefully you can learn from this and learn what your granddaughter likes and have a positive relationship. Otherwise, she's not going to want to be around you.", "YTA - at a supernova level. She tried the food she is not used to, did not like it, and asked for something else. That is actually really good behavior for a 10 year old. Most wont even try it...  \n\nFor going off on a 10 year old in their time in your country, eating a new food for the first time, wow.   \n\nYou may have the idea that kids should eat what is given to them, but this is your grandchild and guest. Whenever new people with kids come to my house, I tell the kids, if they don't like the food we cooked, that is a -okay. I can always make a PBJ sandwich. You don't have to feel like you have to eat it. Because that's how you treat guests.  \n\nIf it is your own child- yeah you can take a different approach. Try everything, if you don't like it the next meal is breakfast. But she is a guest in your home not your kid. Good luck trying to fix this one!", "YTA, how would you feel if someone made something you didn't like, and then demanded you eat it, nothing else. Doesn't sound like I'd like you either if you were my grandma.", "Yta it\u2019s her first time with this flavoring most likely. Her first time being in your country. And she\u2019s feeling uncertain about it all. You forced her to speak her mind, but then took offense. If you\u2019re not ready for the truth don\u2019t ask. He should go to a hotel and get her other food. And you should work on being kind .", "YTA, and I find forcing a child to eat something they sincerely don\u2019t like is rude. So, there.", "YTA for being a jerk to your granddaughter, especially while she is going through such a big and likely scary and uncomfortable transition, AND ALSO for posting on AITA, which literally exists to tell people if they are an AH and has a rule specifically stating posters need to accept the judgment, and then arguing with every commenter who confirms that you are, in fact, TA.", "Omg, hey I get it my parents were abusive too but I instead decided to break the cycle. You know what else is rude? Making a guest feel so unwelcome they want to get away from you. Definitely TA.", "You aren\u2019t the parent here- you don\u2019t get to force her to eat something she doesn\u2019t like. \n\nShe acted like a child might- but so did you. Imagine being such a small, petty person that you get offended over something as small as a CHILD not liking your food. That isn\u2019t very mature behavior on your part. \n\nBe careful- or you might not see much of either of them in the future. I sure as shit wouldn\u2019t bring kids around you again after you acted like this. \n\nYTA, without a doubt.", "YTA children are picky especially when trying new foods especially if they aren\u2019t used to spices . You are supposed to be the adult remember? She could have simply had something else and continued on with the day. Now your grandchild will remember this and have a bad memory with curry. It\u2019ll make her definitely not want to visit you ever again", "YTA. Way to destroy your relationship with your grandkid on the first day. The kid may have been rude, but they just moved across the world, are in a brand new place, and probably aren\u2019t used to you or the food. Be compassionate.", "I\u2019m with your granddaughter; I don\u2019t like you much, either. Poor kid tried the food, didn\u2019t like it, and asked for something else. What is so terrible about that? I was a very picky child, I am a fairly picky adult, and I appreciate the people who don\u2019t make a big deal about it and just lst me eat something I like. There are bigger battles facing kids, why get stuck on food?", "YTA. You didn't even ask WHY she didn't like it.\n\nIt's curry, they often have spices that supertasters find very offensive. I personally can't have anything with coriander in it, because it literally makes the dish taste indistinguishable from soap. It's vile, no matter how well the dish was cooked by the standards of someone without the soap-coriander gene. That means a lot of curries are off my table. \n\nIf your granddaughter had something like that, and the dish tasted like soap to her, would you have made her eat it? Would you consider her spoiled if she didn't eat something tasting of literal soap? You may like this dish, but you have no idea what it tastes like to another person, and you got angry without even asking.", "YTA. She\u2019s not your child and you were being rude.", "You seem to find everything offensive. Do you have something against the child, or more specifically against her mother? \n\nCurry may not be for everyone. And the kid was very well behaved to try and whisper something that wasn\u2019t very nice to say out loud. You just got malicious complianced and now you\u2019re mad about it. \n\nJust do some soul searching and try to figure out if you are not misdirecting anger (justified or otherwise) against a kid you met for the first time.\n\nEdit : YTA.", "Why are you offended that the child is unused to you, unused to your cooking style and unused to curry? This isn't about you. So, why are you making it personal? Curry is hot and its aromatic too. So what, if your grandchildren have a blander diet than you observe, why is it a big deal?\n\nYTA. You make the dog eat whatever you put in front of him. But, unless someone demanded you become a short order chef, there is no reason to treat your grandchild like I'd treat a dog, is there?\n\nYTA. You're being ridiculous and you need to dial it back.", "YTA\n\n1) Not many 10 year olds are going to eat curry for the first time and start downing it especially if it was spicy. So that wasn't a great meal choice.\n\n2) You asked her to tell you what she said. So she did. You can't get angry at her for following your instructions.\n\n3) Like it or not kids do have to eat. You were not the first one to have your cooking judged by their grandkids and you won't be the last. So you should have given them they would eat.", "YTA \n\nAre you going for the worst grandma of the year award?\nYou suck as a welcome committee... And you sound cold af in your post.\n\nBut hey, at this rate they won't be back anytime soon. So you can have all the curry you want. Yey! \n\nPs. If a 10yr child comes to visit for the first time, and your grandchild at that, you don't make something YOU want. You make something SHE wants.", "Siding with your soon - YTA -I don't have much more to add than what's already been posted here. \n\n1. new country, new food. i mean, what else is there to say. kid actually TRIED the food- KUDOS to the kid for trying new food.\n2. you were offended she privately told her dad something- forced her to say it aloud and then wanted her punished for doing as you've asked.", "YTA.  Not your decision to make.  She will remember this for  along time.  Do you want her to like you??", "YTA", "YTA\n\nShe tried it, she didn't like it. Maybe we're talking cultural differences here since you indicated she just moved from another country. But it's not up to you to decide what your grandchild eats or how she gets disciplined. You were mean and rude and your behavior is no way to build a relationship with her. You need to lighten up.", "YTA for sure. Need you ask?", "Giant YTA, you sound controlling.", "Curry is a lot for a child. I have to be in the mood for curry myself\n\nYTA", "OP must be the best guest ever - They go to a new place and immediately scarf down all the new foods. \n\nDidn't grow up eating meat?

Sign OP UP.\n\nBurnt the toast and made rubbery eggs because you can't cook? OP doesn't care. Food must be eaten! \n\nBecause no-one ever has had to adjust to new food.

It'd even be even more of an issue if she has food sensitivity issues because, if she does, it's something that she can't even help or fix easily.", "Grandmas fighting for her life in these comment lmao. YTA for sure. Forcing a kid to eat something they don\u2019t like", "You are a really gross grandparent. \nNo wonder the kid is 10 and just now visiting.", "YTA. You sound like a joy to be around.", "Curry is a strong spice to try for the first time as a young child. Give them a break. Don\u2019t cause issues, they just arrived in the country. Each child is different. Just because they don\u2019t parent like you did, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong. Open your mind a little", "YTA. Respect is something that works bidirectional. Of you don't respect your grandchild, you cannot expect the kid to respect you.\n\nCurry has quite a strong taste. You cannot expect that everyone likes it, especially if they have not tasted it before.", "Well... she was very rude yes. \n\nBut forcing a foreign kid finishing a plate of food they tried and don't like it is not a smart move at all.\n\nYou should work with babystep like: \"It's okay if you don't like it but don't spit out and just say you don't like it.\"", "YTA - Curry can be a bit spicy for some people, let alone a 10 year old. I like some spicy foods, but not curry myself. You keep defending yourself here despite all the YTA's. Sometimes you have to be a bit flexible with kids, but you seem to be immovable.
