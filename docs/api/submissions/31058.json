Since we\u2019ve been getting closer to her due date, my parents (64F, 59M) have been talking about when they will come meet their new grandchild (they live five hours away). It should be noted that I have one sibling, but she is decidedly child-free, so these are their only grandkids.\n\nWhen our first was born, it was the end of September and my parents visisted the week he was born. They visited again during the week of Christmas. I had told mom that we would prefer if they visited before Christmas week but my parents either ignored me or forgot about that conversation. It was fine, but we were exhausted with a 3 month old and my wife had to spend the end of her maternity leave with her in-laws.\n\nThis time, I made it clear to my mom that we wanted to have the holidays without any visitors so we could focus on our newly grown family, especially because the newborn period is a very vulnerable time for the mother and I don\u2019t want a repeat of last time. She said she understood.\n\nWhile they were visiting last (during my son\u2019s birthday), they were hashing out when they would visit baby 2. My dad said \u201cwhy don\u2019t we come for Christmas\u201d or something like that. I told him no and they could come sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas, but not during Christmas week\n\nLast week my dad and I were talking on the phone about their plan and he brought up coming for Christmas again. I told him \u201cI already said no. Our doors will be locked during that week.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s been pissy lately whenever we talk and saying things like \u201cthe holidays are supposed to be spent with family\u201d and \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t keep your in-laws from visiting.\u201d My mom is asking me if we\u2019ll reconsider because my dad feels really hurt and she said I\u2019m a jerk for not even taking it to my wife.\n\nSo, AITA for telling my dad they can\u2019t come for Christmas?", "created_utc": 1700103887, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17wcbg4/aita_for_telling_my_dad_they_cant_come_for/", "score": 232, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You and your wife have already discussed this issue and had decided before they asked that the holidays were going to just be for your growing family.  It sucks that they are butt hurt about it, but that's not your problem.  Keeping your family happy and healthy, especially not stressing your post partum wife after she gives birth, is your problem.

OP has told them to visit the weeks before or after, instead of the actual holiday. It is perfectly acceptable to want to spend the official holiday (and typically time off work) with ones own immediate family unit.\n\nMy husband and I decided over a decade ago that we would not be leaving our home on December 25th.
