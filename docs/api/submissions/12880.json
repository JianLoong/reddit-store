My mom (40f) is currently in school to become a licensed therapist, and has picked up a part time job at a nearby office ($15/hr) to help make ends meet while attending class and taking care of the family. I (18m) am still in high school and am planning on moving out the week after graduation. \n\nI\u2019ve saved for years and have been planning with my roommate to facilitate my move for a long time now. With that being said, I\u2019m very stressed about making enough money while also doing sports and keeping up with school. Recently my mom revealed to me that she had been receiving social security payments since my birth dad\u2019s death in 2007. After I turn 18 tomorrow those payments have to go to an account with my name on it\u2014 thus making it my money legally. My mother told me that she\u2019s worried about paying the bills and taking care of the family, and was planning on taking that money from me to do that (around $1000/month). \n\nThat was all well and good, and I was happy to help the family. Until she started shopping for a new car, going out almost every night, planning a cabin trip with her friends, etc. Because of this behavior and the impression that we\u2019re not struggling financially at all, im extremely hesitant to let her take that money. Both of my siblings got and will get to keep every cent of that money when they receive(d) those checks (both are lazy and live at home with no plans of moving out). I feel like I\u2019ve worked way too hard to be able to move out to have this happen to me.
