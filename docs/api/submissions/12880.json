The moment you can and the banks open, you need to go to your bank and withdraw as much as you can without closing the account (since you likely have a joint account, you will probably need the other account holder to be there to actually close the account) then you need to go to a bank different than one she uses and open an account in your name only. Yes, you may have to miss some school for this but the fact that she already seems to know how to take the money from you (again, likely because it'll be going into a joint account) makes such a move critical. In fact, you should probably check the balance to the account and make sure the money that is supposed to be there really is there, since she may already be taking money from the account already as an authorized signer. After that, make sure that any auto deposits go to the new account, or at the very least the moment it hits the joint account it automatically gets transferred to your new account while you get the auto deposits sorted with employer(s) and SSA. Get your SS and birth certificate away from your mom ASAP so that she can't use it to open other accounts/lines of credit in your name (plus you will likely need at least one of those documents to open your new account). You should probably grab the other big important documents like your transcripts and passport while you are at it. Flag your SS#, you can do that through the social security website. Also check with the 3 credit bureaus and put a freeze on your credit so that she can't use your credit for anything. When she realizes that she doesn't have access to that money she is going to get pissed, and either try to guilt you into giving it to her or at the very least threaten to kick you out until she gets the money. As such, you need to be ready to get out ASAP, so pack the most important things to you and be ready to go. You may have to (unfortunately) couch surf for a couple of months, but the end result may be worth it. Your other option would be to accept the loss of that income for the next 2 months (until your graduation), and be ready to drop the change over to your new account the moment you move out.

The eligibility for the SS survivor\u2019s checks in the US is the following:\n1 - a benefit for a minor child\n2 - spouses may receive a benefit of their own, but usually only if they make very little money. It sounds like your mom does not receive this benefit on her own.\n\nImportant: if the surviving spouse remarries, the survivor\u2019s SS benefits stop.\n\nA lot of the details here seem off. Please do confirm independently that you (as an adult on your 18th birthday) will receive the check, and if there is anything needed to restart them due to the separation of your mom and stepfather, please look into that.\n\nAdvice given by others to keep the account in your name only, for your living expenses, is sound. \n\nSending you good parental karma.

We had the same situation with my stepson.   He ended up living with us his senior year and up until he turned 18 the SS checks were going to his mom (who was on disability).   Well when he turned 18 she had a rude awakening.   She even had the nerve to call me and state she needed those check.  ( remember he had been living with us for months at this point and she had no out of pocket expenses other than her own)    I helped my stepson get those checks sent to our house and told him that was his money and great little windfall for starting college.   Keep the money it is yours!", "If the child continues with furthering education, the benefits continue until, I believe, 23.", "He\u2019s already planning on moving out, so who cares if she throws him out?", "If you turn 18 before you graduate you get paid until the month you graduate.", "The checks will still come directly to him until the month after he graduates high school. That's what happened when I started directly receiving the survivor's benefits from my Dad once I turned 18.", "But he isn\u2019t look going to be living at home, he\u2019s moving out as soon as he turns 18 so it\u2019s his money", "NTA she is manipulating you", "NTA", "Nta", "NTA, that money is meant to support \\*you\\*.  If you're moving out, then that money needs to go with you.  If you wanted to compromise with your mom you could suggest that ALL THREE OF YOU pay rent and that all three pay the same amount to help make up for the difference, but it's severely unfair of her to take your entire payment, especially when you're the only one with plans to leave.", "nta she is using you. shes the parent and shouldnt be taking money away from her 18 year old son.", "YWNBTA to keep it in your name. If she really has necessary expenses you can pay those for her to make sure she doesn't squander it. Absolutely DO NOT give her free reign over it. It's a temptation that has ruined countless relationships. Don't give her the rope to hang herself because that's some fackin expensive rope.", "NTA", "The survivor's benefits are yours to claim. Unless you wish to continue living at home, I'd bank the money because you'll likely have need of it in the very near future. Your mom really has no standing to force the issue - even while I feel sorry for her circumstances. Some benefits cease when a surviving child turns 18. I hope your mom understands that these things have expiration dates?\n\nNTA.", "Nope. NTA.\n\nYour mom is planning to keep the lifestyle she got accustomed to, except it will be with your money and not her husband's. She needs to act like the adult she is and figure it out. \n\nAlso, the fact she plans to keep only your money and not your siblings speaks volumes about what she thinks of you. She's perfectly okay with throwing you under the bus. You need to make sure she doesn't have access to it, because she will strip you clean: transfer into an account she doesn't have access to, and most importantly, do not tell her anything before everything is locked!\n\nIf she tries to manipulate you into giving her the money because you still live with her, either move out or offer to participate to your share of the bills (so if you're 4 in the house, pay a fourth of the bills). It would be nice if you could keep that money for your start in life, but it might be a step into keeping the peace (if you want to keep the peace that is. Again, the fact that your siblings are not expected anything worries me about what she thinks of you. It might be a good idea to look at your relationship under a cold hard light.)", "NTA", "Def NTA. If she was struggling financially, then what are the cabin trips for? I was an immigrant and when I first came to rom my to my current home my parents couldn't afford such luxuries as new cars (my dad came here prior (2-3 yrs) before my family did so we did have a car) and had a smaller house than ours now. OP's mom is talking cabin trips and treating herself every night??? OP's is NTA", "My dad passed when my youngest sister was only 13 and my mom had to account to the SS office at the end of each year what the money was used for.  Social security stops at the age of 18 if it is survivor benefits.", "That's awsome. More reasonable than the US.", "That's awsome!", "Thats interesting as I was 13 also and my mom never had to do that. Maybe a new thing? I aged out like 20 years ago. It stoped when you were 18 and graduated high school so I got a check addressed to me for 3 months from between my 18th bday and when I graduated.", "It used to continued through college until the laws changed in 1981 under the Regan administration."]}
