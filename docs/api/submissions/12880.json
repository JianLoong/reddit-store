My mom (40f) is currently in school to become a licensed therapist, and has picked up a part time job at a nearby office ($15/hr) to help make ends meet while attending class and taking care of the family. I (18m) am still in high school and am planning on moving out the week after graduation. \n\nI\u2019ve saved for years and have been planning with my roommate to facilitate my move for a long time now. With that being said, I\u2019m very stressed about making enough money while also doing sports and keeping up with school. Recently my mom revealed to me that she had been receiving social security payments since my birth dad\u2019s death in 2007. After I turn 18 tomorrow those payments have to go to an account with my name on it\u2014 thus making it my money legally. My mother told me that she\u2019s worried about paying the bills and taking care of the family, and was planning on taking that money from me to do that (around $1000/month). \n\nThat was all well and good, and I was happy to help the family. Until she started shopping for a new car, going out almost every night, planning a cabin trip with her friends, etc. Because of this behavior and the impression that we\u2019re not struggling financially at all, im extremely hesitant to let her take that money. Both of my siblings got and will get to keep every cent of that money when they receive(d) those checks (both are lazy and live at home with no plans of moving out). I feel like I\u2019ve worked way too hard to be able to move out to have this happen to me.

I was in a simlar situation (social security wise). I belive mine stopped when I graduated hs but I can't rember for sure.", "NTA. The money is yours. Do not give it to her, especially if you plan on moving out. Do not let her put her name on the account.

If you are enrolled in college or trade school they will continue till you are 22.", "NTA. That money is for you. You should use it for yourself not for your Mom. It should be used to pay your bills or help pay for your schooling, not your Mom\u2019s. She\u2019s had years of using your money. It\u2019s your turn now.", "NTA. You answered you own question. If she's spending like that and looking at new cars, it's disgusting that she's planning to take money from her child.

Before 18 its basically goverment child support. My mom got it too and really didn't matter how she spent it. It is only going to him untill he graduates high school then it should stop unless something has changed it the past 20 years. This is of cource assuming its suvivors benefits and his dad died.", "Correct. My sister\u2019s SS benefits stopped as soon as she turned 18. My mom used the few checks she did get to supplement the child support that was lost when her dad died. It\u2019s not stealing at all.", "In my country the money stops only if the kid dicede not going to college and if they go it will stop if they change the curse, stop college or if they graduate. There's even some that are only fore women that will stop only if they get married.", "NTA. The moment you can and the banks open, you need to go to your bank and withdraw as much as you can without closing the account (since you likely have a joint account, you will probably need the other account holder to be there to actually close the account) then you need to go to a bank different than one she uses and open an account in your name only. Yes, you may have to miss some school for this but the fact that she already seems to know how to take the money from you (again, likely because it'll be going into a joint account) makes such a move critical. In fact, you should probably check the balance to the account and make sure the money that is supposed to be there really is there, since she may already be taking money from the account already as an authorized signer. After that, make sure that any auto deposits go to the new account, or at the very least the moment it hits the joint account it automatically gets transferred to your new account while you get the auto deposits sorted with employer(s) and SSA. Get your SS and birth certificate away from your mom ASAP so that she can't use it to open other accounts/lines of credit in your name (plus you will likely need at least one of those documents to open your new account). You should probably grab the other big important documents like your transcripts and passport while you are at it. Flag your SS#, you can do that through the social security website. Also check with the 3 credit bureaus and put a freeze on your credit so that she can't use your credit for anything. When she realizes that she doesn't have access to that money she is going to get pissed, and either try to guilt you into giving it to her or at the very least threaten to kick you out until she gets the money. As such, you need to be ready to get out ASAP, so pack the most important things to you and be ready to go. You may have to (unfortunately) couch surf for a couple of months, but the end result may be worth it. Your other option would be to accept the loss of that income for the next 2 months (until your graduation), and be ready to drop the change over to your new account the moment you move out. Still get all your important docs and things ready to go and open up that new bank account ASAP.", "NTA -\n\nYour going to school and moving out.  You have saved money unrelated to what you will get.  Keep was you are due, go to school.  Your mom has already enjoyed the benefits of the monthly checks.  She knew you would turn 18 at some point so her poor planning is on her.\n\nNTA", "NTA Keep it and run away", "NTA.  That money is for your support, not hers.", "NTA; the SS checks are for you. \n\nMy condolences on your loss.\n\nMy spouse died when our child was very little and I receive SS benefits for our child. The benefit is titled: \u201cMy (parent) name for benefit of child\u2019s name\u201d. The eligibility for the SS survivor\u2019s checks in the US is the following:\n1 - a benefit for a minor child\n2 - spouses may receive a benefit of their own, but usually only if they make very little money. It sounds like your mom does not receive this benefit on her own.\n\nImportant: if the surviving spouse remarries, the survivor\u2019s SS benefits stop.\n\nA lot of the details here seem off. Please do confirm independently that you (as an adult on your 18th birthday) will receive the check, and if there is anything needed to restart them due to the separation of your mom and stepfather, please look into that.\n\nAdvice given by others to keep the account in your name only, for your living expenses, is sound. \n\nSending you good parental karma. I hope your move towards independence goes smoothly!", "NTA - But make sure you have a plan to move out immediately since it won't be pleasant for you.   If she asks, tell her to get $$ from your siblings who are still there.   OR, Oh, I thought you didn't have $$ issues because I saw (Insert), and I need it now since I'm living elsewhere.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen refuse to discuss any more.  Hang up on her every time she tries.  Good luck!", "It is not your responsibility to support your family. You are young and is your mothers responsibility to take care of the family. She is taking advantage of you and it is not right not only is it unethical is also illegal. She cannot take your money and use it for her benefit especially you being over 18 if Social Security ever found out, they would make her pay that back to you. Trust me I\u2019ve known people that tried this, I would not allow this to happen and you are too young and you have too much going for you and don\u2019t ever feel guilty to keep with is yours. It sounds like your mother is very selfish and taking advantage of her children is even worse I hope that you can leave this situation, and not feel guilty about helping yourself", "NTA. You're a child technically and shouldn't have to be financially responsible for an adult", "NTA!"]}
