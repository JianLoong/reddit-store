It's awful that your parents are bigots but he's rude to your kids and bringing him in seems like a bad influence.\n\nI can understand why he's a misbehaved child since he grew up gay with homophobic parents and that's usually traumatic and my heart goes out to him, homeless at 16 is awful are your parents even legally allowed to kick him out at 16? Is there a group home that would take him in? Maybe a way to help from a distance?", "NTA.\n\nGabe needs to face reality now and fast.\n\n>He is blasting us on social media calling us homophobes\n\nI\u2019m a strong ally of the LGBTQ+ community but I seriously can\u2019t stand it when someone calls another [insert here]phobic because they aren\u2019t getting their way. Y\u2019all aren\u2019t letting him live there because he is gay, it's because he misbehaves and isn\u2019t acting right. \n\nGabe needs to realize that his behavior is the reason y\u2019all won\u2019t let him live there and not is sexuality. Also, y\u2019all got him a hotel so it's not like y\u2019all aren\u2019t leaving him homeless", "Regardless of the circumstances, this person is a minor, a child.

Schools have resources that could help.", "NTA. It's a shitty situation, but you made the right choice for your family. My gut tells me your brother is acting out cause he was brought up by homophobic parents. That really takes a toll on a young gay man (or woman). It's pretty sad, but there isn't much you can do", "Based on your reasons, I totally get it, but you need to be prepared to have people believe your brother\u2019s version of events.\n\nStill, don\u2019t let him move in unless he gets his act together. If you can\u2019 trust him not to start fights, steal or trash your home, you can\u2019t trust him in your home.\n\nThat being said, your little brother is now 16 and homeless. I won\u2019t blame his bad attitude on his upbringing, although your parents sound pretty awful, but he does need somewhere safe to stay. Does he have friends to crash with or somewhere else he\u2019ll stay after the hotel money runs out? If not, you should probably consider calling CPS or the local equivalent.\n\nNTA.", "NTA- Your parents are responsible for him, not you. Your triplets are your responsibility, and if he is awful to them, then he shouldn't be around.", "NTA. If he wants to pretend to be an adult by making his own rules, then he can take care of himself. Stealing and breaking things without remorse is more than enough reason to not want him living in your home. He sounds like a total menace and I wouldn't let him move in either. Being gay would have nothing to do with it", "NTA-but I don't see how they can kick him out at 16 when they are responsible for him until 18.", "NTA - your first obligation is to the safety and comfort of your kids and husband. You're also doing good by paying for a hotel room. \n\nHowever, the authorities need to be notified that your parents kicked him out with no resources. He's under 18 and very vulnerable to exploitation if he mixes with the wrong people, which it sounds like he might be doing based on the additional context you provided.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t about him being gay. This is about him being rude, disrespectful and mooching off other people. \n\nIt was a fair question if he was going to get a job. Does Gabe intend on just staying at home smoking all day? \n\nYou\u2019ve housed him once for a week and been burned by his behaviour, so you\u2019re unlikely to do it again.", "Taking in a thief who breaks other people's property and who doesn't respect boundaries would be risky if it was just two adults in the house, much less parents who need to worry about their children and animals as well. I couldn't see doing anything but give reasonable support and guidance from a distance until they proved they are sincere about changing. NTA", "NTA but I definitely wouldn\u2019t be giving him any money if I were you. Call the school or CPS to let them know what\u2019s going on and uninvolve yourself.", "NTA\n\nEither respond to his social media posts with a copy of the hotel bill you paid and/or stop paying for him.\n\nHe gets a freebie and complains he didn't get more?? The audacity..", "NTA\n\nThe stealing, smoking, fighting drop out refuses to attend school or get a job and is abusive to you, your spouse and your kids, \n\nStop giving him anything,  he can call child protective services and deal with their rules.", "NTA. You need to care for your immediate family first. Being gay is fine. Being irresponsible and combative is not. Give Gabe a firm deadline on the financial support you are giving him but tell him that if there is one more negative post on social media, the financial help stops immediately.", "*Assuming you and your husband aren't homophobic,* NTA.\n\nThis is tough. Gabe is obviously extremely vulnerable right now and his acting out probably has a lot to do with his own inner turmoil of being gay with homophobic parents. If he doesn't get support and some help, he's going to keep going down a road that will become gradually harder to turn around on. \n\nThat being said, you have an obligation to your family. Being gay doesn't excuse his toxic behavior. You can be gay and asshole and not wanting this kind of influence around your kids doesn't make you homophobic in and of itself. He's old enough to be taught the difference.\n\nIt's a lose-lose situation. He definitely needs a healthier environment, support, and to be around people who make him feel OK being himself. But he also has to participate in that environment and put the work in himself. The magical Hallmark scenario of learning the meaning of Christmas over a winter break simply doesn't exist. It's going to be a process. I hope you're part of that process in some way, but it's understandable why you chose to disallow him in your home.", "Explain to him that \u201cjob\u201d is shorthand for doing things other find valuable.  If he acts like he hates the world, the world has no problem reacting the same way.  NTA", "NTA, your household comes first and doesn't seem like he would be a good addition to that.", "NTA. The fact that Gabe is gay does not change the fact that he is a bad human being who you do not want around your family. He is abusing the fact that he is gay as an excuse to extort you.  Gay or not gay, he does not deserve your help. For the record your parents are also A.", "As the mom of a gay young man.... \n\nNTA\n\nYou are not refusing to house your brother because he is gay. \n\nYou are refusing to create a negative situation in your home and are protecting your immediate family. \n\nI'm happy that you made sure he was housed. Obviously a hotel is not a long term solution. \n\nEven if he went into transitional housing meant to support kids in his situation, there would be rules and behavioral expectations. \n\nAre there charities you could reach out to for him? Could CPS be a solution? They may be able to provide access to support and therapy. \n\nCan you get him into therapy? \n\nThe situation sucks but your ultimate responsibility is to provide a safe stable environment for your kids.", "NTA. Sounds like Gabe needs a giant dose of reality. Being gay is not an excuse to get out of being a decent human being, and it sounds like he's trying to use it as an excuse to get you or others to take him in and to make your parents look bad. \n\nLet someone who believes his story take him in. He you-know-what'd around and found out. Kudos to you for putting your husband and kids first in this case.", "NTA  You say that you have tried this before and it did not work out.  I do not expect that anything would change just because your parents kicked your brother out.  You need to look out for your husband and kids before you even think about your brother.", "NTA. He\u2019s a minor though so your parents aren\u2019t legally allowed to kick him out. Not sure what there is to be done about that. But no one is obligated to house anyone regardless of the situation. He could be an angel and you still wouldn\u2019t be obligated to let him live with you. No one is owed that.", "NTA but your brother needs to get a therapist for being raised by such shitty people.", "NTA You have a good enough reason not to let him into your home, but I am worried about him being on the streets.", "NTA. I totally understand your reasons for not being able to support Gabe and you do have to put your family\u2019s wellbeing first, but I do feel incredibly sorry for him. \n\nIt\u2019s quite possible to me that his behaviour is a product of being gay while living in a homophobic environment. I\u2019m not saying that makes it OK or that you should accommodate him as a result, just that I have some compassion for him.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how he\u2019s ever going to have the opportunity to change without a supportive environment. Again, not saying you should accommodate him, just that it\u2019s a very sad situation.\n\nThere are services that help queer kids in these situations precisely for these reasons. Maybe someone could help him access those because being around people who have had similar experiences and have expertise in these areas might also help him deal with everything emotionally.", "NTA.  You have made sure he is sheltered for now and that counts for something.", "NTA but wondering how your parents kicked him out if he is only 16. Can you call social services?", "Nta.  \n\nCut him off totally.   Stop paying his hotel room.   Make him have a reason to get a job.", "NTA \n\nYour brother is in need of a huge reality check. It sucks him being gay was the last straw, but it sounds like even if he hadn't come out, he was going to get the boot eventually.\n\nThe fact that he continues to berate you even after you gave him money for a hotel is ridiculous. Once he gets a job and cleans up his act, then consider helping him further. Until then, don't give him any more money.", "NTA. You have kids, and as their parent you are responsible for keeping them safe. Gabe does not sound safe. You would be ta if you knowingly exposed your kids to harm.", "NTA", "NTA, but Gabe needs a reality check. Are there any wilderness camps wheee you live? That could work if he is forced to go. Good luck.", "What did you do about your parents", "NTA. If your brother is as awful as you said, not having him in your home is the correct decision, it's harsh but correct.\n\nNgl I got some sympathy for your brother, he seems to be in a bad situation. I think that you should try to talk some sense into him in a way that he listens to it, and make sure that he knows that the reason he isn't allowed to live with you guys is NOT because he is gay but because he is terrible. Teenagers are awfully ignorant in their own flaws and try to blame something else. Is there any way for him to appease the situation with his parents?", "You don't sound like homophobes so much as you sound unwilling to assist a teenage relative who has no resources to fall back on. ESH. Where is he supposed to go? (An unhoused teenager is much less likely to complete high school, after all.) And you have yet to call an intervention service agency on your brother's behalf. In most states a 16-year-old can choose to not attend school, but his care givers can't legally put him out for being 16. They are two very different things. Child abandonment issues abound for your parents and they should be reported for the crime because your brother is not an emancipated minor, is he?", "NTA", "ESH. He\u2019s acting out because his family has turned their collective backs on him. He\u2019s only 16, he needs to straighten up (for the lack of a better term), but he shouldn\u2019t be cast aside either. \n\nThere\u2019s plenty of time for him to improve in the right setting.", "ESH. Why did you give him money for a hotel? This seems like an angry and understandably repressed kid screaming out in so many ways. If you really want to help him set firm boundaries. No money or assistance unless his behavior changes. If he wants to live life the way he\u2019s been choosing then he does so alone. But if he\u2019s willing to change his sister is there to help him", "He's 16 for crying out loud. Who just got kicked out of his home. He has no one. You have to at least have some kindness in your heart towards your brother - understand that his situation is unbelievably difficult and cruel. That's why he's acting like such an idiot.\n\nMaybe start with \"Yes, but you have to work with us to make this work\"? \nHonestly YTA just for how you phrased this post with such callousness. Whether you let him live with you or not is your decision in the end, you have every right to decline him.", "So your brother gets kicked out as a minor for something he can't control and you let your adult husband bully him furthermore when the kid literally has nothing? He has no belongings, no home, no family, ESH especially parents. Who cares if they hate each other let him get on his feet. Gabe sucks too for being a dick to children. I understand not wanting to get a job because he's 16 and should be taken care of but he just has to grow up now. Does your other family refuse to take Gabe because he's gay or is it due to being a bad house guest? Either way I think you should give Gabe a two week trial since he is your brother. Tell him to act right and actively look for a job and if he doesn't then kick him out. Don't say no based off something that happened when he wasn't homeless.", "YTA: He is still a child regardless of your reasons. You need to find him care. Call child protective services. Someone needs to help this kid if his family isn't.", "Lu appears to be homophobic. Mainly because he excuses your parents from kicking out your minor bother and says it is due to other behaviors as well - except this doesn't check out with the fact that they kicked him out right after he came out as gay, and kept him while he was doing those behaviors while not out.  YTA.", "YTA - it is your 16 yr old brother during one of the most difficult moments in his life.", "YTA. Sure, you're under no legal obligation to help your brother. But you're an asshole if you don't.\n\nDid you and your husband ever think for a minute that your brother's poor behaviour is a result of being forced to live with parents who literally hate him? Take a moment to reflect on what it must be like to find out the two people in the world who should love you unconditionally, don't. And in fact, hate you so much that when you show them your true self, they kick you out of your home and leave you, a child, to fend for yourself. \n\nYour brother is still a child. You are the adult here. Act like it. Set firm boundaries, make him go to therapy, whatever you need to do. But don't abandon your brother.

Plus, given that both of them were raised by the same homophobic parents, I can see Gabe, in his anger and stress, feeling that OP was using his behavior as a cop-out to avoid claiming to be homophobic themselves (not that I think this is the case, but when you're cornered and between a rock and a hard place and desperate the way Gabe is, your mind can go to very dark places, which is exactly what I think that poor kid is dealing with now).

You literally never let your child be homeless. Like. What is wrong with them.", "Ok have a good one", "I don't think you understand. 16 year old children aren't supposed to be living in a hotel. They're supposed to have a fucking guardian.\n\nI don't even know if what op is doing is legal.", "Personally I would walk away rather than throw gasoline on this tragic fire. That child is making public cries for help by doing all of this crazy shit. They're going to have a hard life if nobody steps in and helps them figure out how to be a functional adult; everything I know about child development makes me think his whole upbringing was shit. \n\nHomophobe parents don't produce functional children. They don't even have a relationship with op.", "I think there's a time and place for trying to teach people these kinds of lessons and you and I both know that mid housing crisis is not the fucking time.", "You're definitely right, a 16 year old in the middle of being kicked out of their house is going to behave in really rational and emotionally sound ways\n\n/s\n\nYou expect too much from a child. You all do. Op isn't required to take them in but your judgement of this battered child is pretty telling.", "That's why he needs therapy. If it stems from an inability to process trauma  stress he isn't gonna be successful by himself. If he stops certain behaviors he's gonna need help when he develops new ones. Being convinced everyone is out to get you doesn't require a heavy mental illness just a hostile and dangerous environment.", "16 year olds are basically children.\n\nTheir brains have literally not developed all of the needed hardware for making good decisions.\n\nThey do have increased responsibility, but that has to be held in tension with their status as children. \n\nI think OP is making the right call to protect her own kids, and I think the kid is behaving like a jackass, but he's still a child.", "The majority on this sub have very unreasonable expectations of a 16 year old and seem to think being homeless is a walk in the park..", "I typically do, but thanks.", ">I don't even know if what op is doing is legal.\n\nWhat do you mean? How can anything OP is doing illegal?", "If you're upset about the legality of the situation, take it up with the bigot parents.\n\nOp has every right not to house him when he 1: won't get a job after he dropped out of school 2: won't respect her kids and husband 3: steals and break things 4: gets into fights 5: constant smoking with no regard to anyone else 6: doesn't even take care of his hygiene and 7: talking trash about the only relatives that are giving him any sort of aid.\n\nHim being gay does not automatically excuse the rest of his sh*tty behavior and Op is not obligated to house him.", "What are you talking about? What could Op be doing that is illegal?\n\nPutting up the kid in a hotel on their dime is illegal? I think you're misreading the post.", "Funny, I thought that\u2019s what OP was trying to do when they laid out their conditions for housing the kid. Sure they weren\u2019t ideal conditions. But given what we know about the kid based on the post, they\u2019re not horribly unreasonable. \n\nAlso, there\u2019s a difference between a public\u2019s cry for help and flinging accusations that could have serious impacts on OP. \n\nAgain, the whole situation is messed up. But the kid isn\u2019t helping himself with his antics.", "Fallacy of relative privation \u2013 dismissing an argument or complaint due to what are perceived to be more important problems. \n\nMore than one problem can be addressed at once. Especially when their behavioural problems are linked to their housing crisis. OP doesn\u2019t have to be their brothers punching bag just because his life sucks. \n\nOn some level you are right, OP tiffing with her brother online isn\u2019t going to help much of anything and I honestly don\u2019t think the brother will learn his lesson from this interaction, but OP is entitled to defend herself. Her brothers rhetoric could wrongly lead other LGBT+ family and friends to believe they can\u2019t rely on OP and that\u2019s not right.\n\nPeople like OP\u2019s brother need either an epiphany (usually reached at rock bottom) or someone with unlimited time, patience, and understanding. OP taking half measures to help him won\u2019t do anything and she doesn\u2019t have the situation to exact full measures.", "You seem to know more about his home life than we do, how do you know he was \"battered\" and \"abused?\"", "OP obviously has empathy. They are putting the brother up in a hotel, keeping him off the streets, while he heaps abuse on them. \n\nOP has small children at home. Exposing them to his behavior, for an indefinite amount of time, at such a young age, is a bridge too far.", "Everyone needs therapy. That\u2019s an empty observation. Enabling him isn\u2019t going to resolve his inability to process trauma. The fact is that he is an unstable person who should not be around young children."]}
