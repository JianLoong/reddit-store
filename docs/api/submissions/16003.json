It's awful that your parents are bigots but he's rude to your kids and bringing him in seems like a bad influence.\n\nI can understand why he's a misbehaved child since he grew up gay with homophobic parents and that's usually traumatic and my heart goes out to him, homeless at 16 is awful are your parents even legally allowed to kick him out at 16? Is there a group home that would take him in? Maybe a way to help from a distance?", "NTA.\n\nGabe needs to face reality now and fast.\n\n>He is blasting us on social media calling us homophobes\n\nI\u2019m a strong ally of the LGBTQ+ community but I seriously can\u2019t stand it when someone calls another [insert here]phobic because they aren\u2019t getting their way. Y\u2019all aren\u2019t lettling him live their because he is gay, it's because he misbehaves and isn\u2019t acting right. \n\nGabe needs to realize that his behavior is the reason y\u2019all won\u2019t let him live there and not is sexuality.", "Regardless of the circumstances, this person is a minor, a child.

Also remind your parents they have a legal obligation until he turns 18 or is emancipated.", "NTA. Contact his school counselors and let them know he\u2019s unhoused and why. Schools have resources that could help.", "NTA. It's a shitty situation, but you made the right choice for your family. My gut tells me your brother is acting out cause he was brought up by homophobic parents. That really takes a toll on a young gay man (or woman). It's pretty sad, but there isn't much you can do", "Based on your reasons, I totally get it, but you need to be prepared to have people believe your brother\u2019s version of events.\n\nStill, don\u2019t let him move in unless he gets his act together. If you can\u2019 trust him not to start fights, steal or trash your home, you can\u2019t trust him in your home.\n\nThat being said, your little brother is now 16 and homeless. I won\u2019t blame his bad attitude on his upbringing, although your parents sound pretty awful, but he does need somewhere safe to stay. Does he have friends to crash with or somewhere else he\u2019ll stay after the hotel money runs out? If not, you should probably consider calling CPS or the local equivalent.\n\nNTA.", "NTA- Your parents are responsible for him, not you. Your triplets are your responsibility, and if he is awful to them, then he shouldn't be around.", "NTA. If he wants to pretend to be an adult by making his own rules, then he can take care of himself. Stealing and breaking things without remorse is more than enough reason to not want him living in your home. He sounds like a total menace and I wouldn't let him move in either. Being gay would have nothing to do with it", "NTA-but I don't see how they can kick him out at 16 when they are responsible for him until 18.", "NTA - your first obligation is to the safety and comfort of your kids and husband. You're also doing good by paying for a hotel room. \n\nHowever, the authorities need to be notified that your parents kicked him out with no resources. He's under 18 and very vulnerable to exploitation if he mixes with the wrong people, which it sounds like he might be doing based on the additional context you provided.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t about him being gay. This is about him being rude, disrespectful and mooching off other people. \n\nIt was a fair question if he was going to get a job. Does Gabe intend on just staying at home smoking all day? \n\nYou\u2019ve housed him once for a week and been burned by his behaviour, so you\u2019re unlikely to do it again.", "Taking in a thief who breaks other people's property and who doesn't respect boundaries would be risky if it was just two adults in the house, much less parents who need to worry about their children and animals as well. I couldn't see doing anything but give reasonable support and guidance from a distance until they proved they are sincere about changing. NTA", "NTA but I definitely wouldn\u2019t be giving him any money if I were you.

The audacity..", "NTA\n\nThe stealing, smoking, fighting drop out refuses to attend school or get a job and is abusive to you, your spouse and your kids, \n\nStop giving him anything,  he can call child protective services and deal with their rules.", "NTA. You need to care for your immediate family first. Being gay is fine. Being irresponsible and combative is not. Give Gabe a firm deadline on the financial support you are giving him but tell him that if there is one more negative post on social media, the financial help stops immediately.", "*Assuming you and your husband aren't homophobic,* NTA.\n\nThis is tough. Gabe is obviously extremely vulnerable right now and his acting out probably has a lot to do with his own inner turmoil of being gay with homophobic parents. If he doesn't get support and some help, he's going to keep going down a road that will become gradually harder to turn around on. \n\nThat being said, you have an obligation to your family. Being gay doesn't excuse his toxic behavior. You can be gay and asshole and not wanting this kind of influence around your kids doesn't make you homophobic in and of itself. He's old enough to be taught the difference.\n\nIt's a lose-lose situation. He definitely needs a healthier environment, support, and to be around people who make him feel OK being himself. But he also has to participate in that environment and put the work in himself. The magical Hallmark scenario of learning the meaning of Christmas over a winter break simply doesn't exist. It's going to be a process. I hope you're part of that process in some way, but it's understandable why you chose to disallow him in your home.", "Explain to him that \u201cjob\u201d is shorthand for doing things other find valuable.  If he acts like he hates the world, the world has no problem reacting the same way.  NTA", "NTA, your household comes first and doesn't seem like he would be a good addition to that.", "NTA. The fact that Gabe is gay does not change the fact that he is a bad human being who you do not want around your family. He is abusing the fact that he is gay as an excuse to extort you.  Gay or not gay, he does not deserve your help. For the record your parents are also A.", "As the mom of a gay young man.... \n\nNTA\n\nYou are not refusing to house your brother because he is gay. \n\nYou are refusing to create a negative situation in your home and are protecting your immediate family. \n\nI'm happy that you made sure he was housed. Obviously a hotel is not a long term solution. \n\nEven if he went into transitional housing meant to support kids in his situation, there would be rules and behavioral expectations. \n\nAre there charities you could reach out to for him? Could CPS be a solution? They may be able to provide access to support and therapy. \n\nCan you get him into therapy? \n\nThe situation sucks but your ultimate responsibility is to provide a safe stable environment for your kids.", "NTA. Sounds like Gabe needs a giant dose of reality. Being gay is not an excuse to get out of being a decent human being, and it sounds like he's trying to use it as an excuse to get you or others to take him in and to make your parents look bad. \n\nLet someone who believes his story take him in. He you-know-what'd around and found out. Kudos to you for putting your husband and kids first in this case.", "NTA  You say that you have tried this before and it did not work out.  I do not expect that anything would change just because your parents kicked your brother out.  You need to look out for your husband and kids before you even think about your brother.", "NTA. He\u2019s a minor though so your parents aren\u2019t legally allowed to kick him out. Not sure what there is to be done about that. But no one is obligated to house anyone regardless of the situation. He could be an angel and you still wouldn\u2019t be obligated to let him live with you. No one is owed that.", "NTA but your brother needs to get a therapist for being raised by such shitty people.", "NTA You have a good enough reason not to let him into your home, but I am worried about him being on the streets.", "NTA. I totally understand your reasons for not being able to support Gabe and you do have to put your family\u2019s wellbeing first, but I do feel incredibly sorry for him. \n\nIt\u2019s quite possible to me that his behaviour is a product of being gay while living in a homophobic environment. I\u2019m not saying that makes it OK or that you should accommodate him as a result, just that I have some compassion for him.\n\nI\u2019m not sure how he\u2019s ever going to have the opportunity to change without a supportive environment. Again, not saying you should accommodate him, just that it\u2019s a very sad situation.\n\nThere are services that help queer kids in these situations precisely for these reasons. Maybe someone could help him access those because being around people who have had similar experiences and have expertise in these areas might also help him deal with everything emotionally.", "NTA.  You have made sure he is sheltered for now and that counts for something.", "NTA but wondering how your parents kicked him out if he is only 16. Can you call social services?", "Nta.  \n\nCut him off totally.   Stop paying his hotel room.   Make him have a reason to get a job.", "NTA \n\nYour brother is in need of a huge reality check. It sucks him being gay was the last straw, but it sounds like even if he hadn't come out, he was going to get the boot eventually.\n\nThe fact that he continues to berate you even after you gave him money for a hotel is ridiculous. Once he gets a job and cleans up his act, then consider helping him further. Until then, don't give him any more money.", "NTA. You have kids, and as their parent you are responsible for keeping them safe. Gabe does not sound safe. You would be ta if you knowingly exposed your kids to harm.", "NTA", "NTA, but Gabe needs a reality check. Are there any wilderness camps wheee you live? That could work if he is forced to go. Good luck.", "What did you do about your parents", "NTA. If your brother is as awful as you said, not having him in your home is the correct decision, it's harsh but correct.\n\nNgl I got some sympathy for your brother, he seems to be in a bad situation. I think that you should try to talk some sense into him in a way that he listens to it, and make sure that he knows that the reason he isn't allowed to live with you guys is NOT because he is gay but because he is terrible. Teenagers are awfully ignorant in their own flaws and try to blame something else. Is there any way for him to appease the situation with his parents?", "You don't sound like homophobes so much as you sound unwilling to assist a teenage relative who has no resources to fall back on. ESH. Where is he supposed to go? (An unhoused teenager is much less likely to complete high school, after all.) And you have yet to call an intervention service agency on your brother's behalf. In most states a 16-year-old can choose to not attend school, but his care givers can't legally put him out for being 16. They are two very different things. Child abandonment issues abound for your parents and they should be reported for the crime because your brother is not an emancipated minor, is he?", "NTA", "ESH. He\u2019s acting out because his family has turned their collective backs on him. He\u2019s only 16, he needs to straighten up (for the lack of a better term), but he shouldn\u2019t be cast aside either. \n\nThere\u2019s plenty of time for him to improve in the right setting.", "ESH. Why did you give him money for a hotel? This seems like an angry and understandably repressed kid screaming out in so many ways. If you really want to help him set firm boundaries. No money or assistance unless his behavior changes. If he wants to live life the way he\u2019s been choosing then he does so alone. But if he\u2019s willing to change his sister is there to help him", "He's 16 for crying out loud. Who just got kicked out of his home. He has no one. You have to at least have some kindness in your heart towards your brother - understand that his situation is unbelievably difficult and cruel. That's why he's acting like such an idiot.\n\nMaybe start with \"Yes, but you have to work with us to make this work\"? \nHonestly YTA just for how you phrased this post with such callousness. Whether you let him live with you or not is your decision in the end, you have every right to decline him.", "So your brother gets kicked out as a minor for something he can't control and you let your adult husband bully him furthermore when the kid literally has nothing? He has no belongings, no home, no family, ESH especially parents. Who cares if they hate each other let him get on his feet. Gabe sucks too for being a dick to children. I understand not wanting to get a job because he's 16 and should be taken care of but he just has to grow up now. Does your other family refuse to take Gabe because he's gay or is it due to being a bad house guest? Either way I think you should give Gabe a two week trial since he is your brother. Tell him to act right and actively look for a job and if he doesn't then kick him out. Don't say no based off something that happened when he wasn't homeless.", "YTA: He is still a child regardless of your reasons. You need to find him care. Call child protective services. Someone needs to help this kid if his family isn't.", "Lu appears to be homophobic. Mainly because he excuses your parents from kicking out your minor bother and says it is due to other behaviors as well - except this doesn't check out with the fact that they kicked him out right after he came out as gay, and kept him while he was doing those behaviors while not out.  YTA.", "YTA - it is your 16 yr old brother during one of the most difficult moments in his life.", "YTA. Sure, you're under no legal obligation to help your brother.

Take a moment to reflect on what it must be like to find out the two people in the world who should love you unconditionally, don't. And in fact, hate you so much that when you show them your true self, they kick you out of your home and leave you, a child, to fend for yourself. \n\nYour brother is still a child. You are the adult here. Act like it. Set firm boundaries, make him go to therapy, whatever you need to do. But don't abandon your brother.

He steals, he fights, he smokes wherever he wants (broke out boundaries many times), he breaks things, straight up doesn\u2019t listen, and he is a filthy child. He stayed with us for a week before and it was horrible.*", "It shouldn't, you're right, but it clearly was. That's just the reality of the situation. Based on his other behaviors, the kid was going to get kicked out one way or another. Parents just used their prejudices as the last nail in the coffin", "Good", "Its OPs responsibility to call the cops, though. And that's all I said.", "I understand. And it gave him a comfortable option instead of a boundary. So he\u2019s free to continue his behavior in an unsustainable situation instead of most likely folding and accepting some rules", "This is a tough one. For what it\u2019s worth, I would bet a lot of money that the reason for his behavioral issues is exactly because of your homophobic parents. Can you try to get him into therapy?", "So you\u2019re okay being married to someone who is homophobic?", "If Lu isn\u2019t homophobic than why is it the main reason ? If the main reason was his thieving, lying, drug use, deceit and having no motivation,  those are all completely justified. But you\u2019ve said twice that it\u2019s because he is gay, which does in fact make Lu homophobic.", "I never said anybody is owed anything.", "Very concerning how people just throw family away \ud83e\udd28. This is still a child.", "This", "That makes him a flawed human, not a bad one.\n\nSmoking is unfortunately an addiction. He\u2019s not doing it to hurt other people. He\u2019s doing it because it is uncomfortable for him not to. And most of those other behaviors probably either stem from needing to support that addiction or from the fact that he knows that no matter how he behaves, his parents\u2019 love was always conditional and that he would lose it as soon as he was honest.\n\nHis circumstances have made him this way and everyone is just kicking him when he\u2019s down instead of trying to help him get out of those circumstances.", "How is that clear? We have no way of knowing the parents\u2019 reasoning.\n\nDo you really think that they would have accepted a gay child who was perfectly behaved?", "the boundary was set when op said the kid couldn\u2019t stay with her. do you want the kid on the street? He deserves to be comfy he\u2019s a child. As for his behavior, if he trashes and steals from the hotel rooms he\u2019s staying at, he will see real world consequences and maybe change his behavior. Putting him on the streets is a sure way to let him ruin his life.", "How is the husband homophobic when the reason he doesn\u2019t want him living with him is because how he treat their kids and his behavior(stealing, breaking stuff, smoking, lazy, etc\u2026) ?", "How is Lu homophobic? It\u2019s OPs parents who have the issue with Gabe being gay. Lu only has an issue with Gabe because he\u2019s stolen from him previously", "I took that to mean Lu was saying the main reason the parents kicked him out was because he was gay, but that there were also other reasons, those other reasons being why Lu does want the kid in his house.", "This doesn't make any sense. Her husband said that the main reason OP's parents kicked the brother out was because he came out as gay, but him being an AH is definitely part of it.\n\nHow does Lu stating that make him a homophobe? Lu didn't kick him out. Lu hasn't done anything except say he doesn't want the kid living with them, which is perfectly understandable when they have 3 small children. I wouldn't want this kid around my children either if all of that is true about him.\n\nHim being gay doesn't immediately make all of that okay.", "I think there's a misunderstanding - Lu said OP's parents mainly kicked Gabe out due to his being gay. Parents can forgive bad behavior, but not breaking cultural norms. Lu kicked Gabe out because he stole and is a general little shit towards him, OP, and their children.", "I think you\u2019ve got it confused? Gabe stated he got kicked out by his parents for being gay, and Lu said while that was the main reason Gabes parents kicked him out, it wasn\u2019t only factor leading to him being kicked out. \n\nLu never said Gabe couldn\u2019t stay because he was gay, it was OPs parents with that issue. Lu only has a problem with Gabes behaviour, as Gabe has previously stolen from Lu.", "You said that she is a bad sister for not allowing him to live with her.", "At 16 you are definitely responsible for your actions. Blood is not always thicker than water. Gabe is a total mess and OP is concerned for HER very young children. She\u2019s helping in only way she can without putting her own family at risk.", "Ahh another one of \"society made them this way\" or \"they were not loved enough\" argument...  People are responsible for their own actions. Everything else can explain why they became what they are, does not change who they are", "No. I am not making a value judgement here on whether Gabe is a \"good\" or \"bad\" person. However, his behavior is bad and OP is definitely NTA for not allowing this kid to live with them. For example, it's not just that Gabe smokes, it's that he \"smokes wherever he wants\", and has trampled boundaries around this issue. I get that nicotine is addictive. Gabe can go outside to smoke or smoke in other places where it is allowed and not disruptive. But he doesn't do that. He is intentionally being an AH. Same with stealing, etc.\n\nI understand that his behavior may stem from the way that he was raised, and that perhaps he was misbehaving so much to try and make his parents stop loving him because it would be easier to be rejected for behavior that he can change than to be rejected for his sexual orientation which he cannot change. It's sad. However, no one is kicking him when he is down. OP is giving him some money which may or may not be a good idea, but he does have a roof over his head. OP, I would advise you to seek resources for Gabe, who is a minor who was kicked out for being gay. There are resources for this. But no one is wrong for not wanting this destructive kid around.", "They're homophobes, so they absolutely wouldn't. But if he didn't have those other bad behaviors, then he could shelter with his other family(OP), and there wouldn't be this problem. \n\nThe fact that's he's a thief, refuses to work, damages property, and is a jerk to everyone would have ended up in his parents kicking him out at some point. He's ignoring that his behavior is why OP isn't welcoming him and using his sexuality as a shield from criticism. Gay people still have to work and take responsibility for their actions. This kid doesn't want to do that. If he doesn't want to go to school, he needs to get a job and take responsibility for himself. \n\nAnd before you start making your assumptions. I'm bisexual and lean towards men, more. I've been working full-time hours since I was 14, turned 30 a few weeks ago.", "Maybe. It\u2019s just not how I\u2019m reading it. I absolutely don\u2019t think that the kid should be taking in, because he\u2019s a whole mess of problems, but I wanted to point out that Lu does  in fact sound homophobic, but that could just be the OP\u2019s writing style.", "\u201cLu said him being gay was the main reason but not the only reason.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m just quoting what the OP said. I absolutely agree that they shouldn\u2019t take him in, but I\u2019m hoping that because the kid is gay doesn\u2019t play any factor into it at all, because that part shouldn\u2019t matter. \n\nThe kid is a troubled mess that doesn\u2019t need to be around little kids and the OP has no obligation to take in a drug using, thieving, lazy sibling.  That\u2019s much more of a reason to not take them in, not their sexuality.", "I hope you are correct. I absolutely agree that this kid shouldn\u2019t be the OP\u2019s parents issue. Perhaps I\u2019m misunderstanding the OP\u2019s words.", "I said she\u2019s not sister of the year, yeah. Do you believe people should only be kind when people are \u201cowed\u201d kindness? Is that what you\u2019re saying?", "On point. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR ACTIONS, not anyone else, not your circumstances. Grow tf up.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true in absolutely every case, but this kid was literally kicked out of his home as a minor because he is attracted to the \u201cwrong\u201d gender.\n\nWhat is the point of being good and following the rules if you know that your parents are going to reject you anyway?", "We\u2019re not talking about the rest of the family, we\u2019re talking about you saying that he is to blame for being kicked out.", "Bro it\u2019s not that hard to understand if you have basic reading comprehension", "That is not what I\u2019m saying. Maybe she\u2019s not the best sister of the year. But if she allowed an unstable teenager who bullies her young kids and also happens to be abusing substances to live with her family, she would be a terrible mother. Life is not so black and white. She\u2019s not \u201cnot being kind\u201d for prioritizing her immediate family.", "Ah yes, homeless teenagers, the most mature demographic. How dare they not be fully developed humans yet? How dare he react to the abusive conditions he grew up in?", "I said it was the last straw for the parents, which is obvious. Didn't say that it was right. But his behavior is also wrong. Him being gay isn't his fault, but he absolutely shares some blame in getting kicked out and being put into this situation. His behavior has, partially, led to this.", "I didn\u2019t call her an asshole.", "He\u2019s reacting to his environment in an explosive and harmful way. OP doesn\u2019t want her young children around that. Your circumstances will never justify hurting other people. Take some damn responsibility.", "Okay?"]}
