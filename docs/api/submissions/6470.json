The double standards here are pretty crazy.\n\n1) \"She said it's rude to turn your nose up at something someone made for you.\" Well, it's also rude, when someone tells you they'd prefer something warm (totally valid and there is a reason people eat cream of rice and soup when the weather is cold), to scoff at them and tell them they are being ridiculous and try to out-science you.\n\n2) She asked you how you would feel if she didn't eat your dinner the following day, and when you said that was fine, she didn't like that answer and said it was bullshit. (How much do you want to bet she's going to do that, maybe not tomorrow but sometime in the near future, to try to \"get you\"?)\n\nLook, chicken salad isn't a five-course meal, she's acting like she slaved over a hot stove all day.

Away you go!", "You aren't getting it, so scroll up and re-read like every comment. It's not about the can of soup he wanted to eat instead of the meal she made him.

I\u2019d just finished eating some cereal and got up to go put the bowl in the sink. Both my mum and the lady we were sharing with (living in a hostel at the time) both scolded me. Apparently I got off the couch *too quickly* and they interpreted that as me having a random tantrum for some reason.\n\nIt\u2019s bloody exhausting.

Because to me, that\u2019s a fairly basic level of communication and respect.", "I make a meal plan on Sundays. Both my partners and all 5 kids can do requests leading up to Sunday. After I go shopping Monday, they have to wait until the next week to have their request because I'm not going shopping again. If there are no requests, it's my choice. If requests are too elaborate, then I choose no, and they can make it themselves or skip it for me to cook something. I'd stop feeding OP with his bullshit.", "It\u2019s not about approval, it\u2019s about communication. \n\nAnd a lot of people? Right now I have a myriad of dinner options. I have a little parcel from the butcher I could eat. I have fresh chicken breast which opens up countless options. It could become mango sweet chilli chicken. It could become fried chicken. It could become an XO stir fry. I have 2 minute noodles in the cupboard. I could defrost basil pesto chicken leftovers. I could have cheese. \n\nSo if I\u2019m doing dinner for myself and my partner, I\u2019ll think what we have, what we need to use up and what I feel like, go hey does x sound good?
