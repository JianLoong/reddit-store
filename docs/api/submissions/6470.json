The double standards here are pretty crazy.\n\n1) \"She said it's rude to turn your nose up at something someone made for you.\" Well, it's also rude, when someone tells you they'd prefer something warm (totally valid and there is a reason people eat cream of rice and soup when the weather is cold), to scoff at them and tell them they are being ridiculous and try to out-science you.\n\n2) She asked you how you would feel if she didn't eat your dinner the following day, and when you said that was fine, she didn't like that answer and said it was bullshit.

Also maybe he's like me and doesn't like tea?", "Really?\n\n[This](https://sundaysuppermovement.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/grilled-chicken-salad-1.jpg) looks like \"a meal\". [This](https://www.dinneratthezoo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/grilled-chicken-salad-4.jpg) too.", "by making a face? I make faces all the time, so do you.", "lenient?? literally everyone I\u2019ve met in my life would also not care if this exact same situation happened to them. this is the most sensitive comment section I\u2019ve seen wow.", "Okay, that's nice for you. Seems like most of the rest of us would be offended by this behavior. That's fine.", "It\u2019s definitely only a US thing, nowhere else a salad automatically means something mixed in mayonnaise.", "Yeah, people are equating \"making a face\" to what a child does at something they hate rather than the more likely and reasonable look of mild disappointment at seeing cold food served on a cold day. He told her why he was disappointed and made his own warm food. She made an issue of it. NTA", "It could\u2019ve even been a face of confusion which, honestly I would\u2019ve probably made the same face \u201chuh\ud83e\udd28 salad you say? On a cold day?\u201d", "He should\u2019ve mentioned it for sure! He probably didn\u2019t expect something cold or a salad for dinner or assume there\u2019d be a need to mention it, which is still completely on him and I\u2019m not getting the vibe from the post that he genuinely expected her to know that\u2014more that he was surprised.", "Where? Where did he take offense? He had a facial reaction, as humans do, she asked what the issue was, he explained. She then tried to invalidate that and tell him why that shouldn\u2019t make sense. He wasn\u2019t offended, at most he was just surprised/disappointed that she didn\u2019t make something warm, but he never states that he expected her to *just know* how he feels about cold food on a cold day.", "He wasn't fuzzy or rude, nor did he take offense..wtf is that reasoning. \nHe made a face which was outside his control and then explained it perfectly fine. There is nothing wrong with  \"I'm rather in the mood for something warm\"\nNot everything needs to be overly apologetic\nThat \"i know it's irrational\" is just to make it look like she is right with her logical temperature answer, which is absolutely useless when it comes to moods and preferences.", "I find it hard to believe that OP made a joyful happy face about chicken salad he didn\u2019t want to eat. Yes it\u2019s natural to make facial expressions but societal norms make reading facial expressions rather easy unless someone is not neurotypical & can\u2019t read expressions as a whole. This could quite possibly be the case with OP because he\u2019s basing every argument on taking GF literally & that the only reason she\u2019s mad is that he made soup, not for his reaction to what she made. He\u2019s not reading the underlying nuance as to why GF is upset. Would she NOT be upset if he made a grilled cheese sandwich instead of soup? I doubt it. She\u2019s upset about his reaction.", "That still only contains around 400 kcals, if you eat 3 full meals a day to you can't consider that a full meal if you want to reach 2200 kcals", "Way to ignore the part where I asked how she considered his feelings.", "He didn\u2019t say it like you just said it though, not at all, and he doesn\u2019t write it like that. His tone is rude here about it even, like he\u2019s annoyed by what she made, not just craving something different.", "I did not get that from this post, and even if it wasn't a joyful expression, it doesn't make him childish. She is upset because he didn't eat her chicken salad.", "It is like \"egg salad\" or \"tuna salad\". Chopped ingredients with a binding agent (mayo).", "Fellow Aussie and a chicken salad sandwich here wouldn\u2019t even be that. It would literally be salad vegetables with cooked chicken added. I\u2019ve only ever seen the chicken salad mayo combination at Costco.", "Look at my comments and look at yours.  Then tell me who the emotional one is.", "It is childish not to use your words & communicate with your SO. There are numerous more productive ways OP could have handled this. Maybe before she starts cooking tell her what he wants! Say \u201chey it\u2019s too cold for chicken salad. Why don\u2019t we have soup instead?\u201d NOT wait until she makes the chicken salad & then make a face (no matter what the face is!) & say \u201cbut I wanted soup instead\u201d.", "I wouldn\u2019t assume that. Last time I ordered a chicken salad in a restaurant it was chicken on top of lettuce. When I want a sandwich like you described I order chicken salad sandwich.", "I've never heard of a chicken salad by default as a sandwich either.", "Im assuming she didn't ask him what he wanted, and when he didn't want what she made, he heated up some soup. He said he wanted something warm, and she argued with him. The entire second paragraph is a wonderful example of communication. Absolutely not an asshole."]}
