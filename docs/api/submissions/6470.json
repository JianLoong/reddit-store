The double standards here are pretty crazy.\n\n1) \"She said it's rude to turn your nose up at something someone made for you.\" Well, it's also rude, when someone tells you they'd prefer something warm (totally valid and there is a reason people eat cream of rice and soup when the weather is cold), to scoff at them and tell them they are being ridiculous and try to out-science you.\n\n2) She asked you how you would feel if she didn't eat your dinner the following day, and when you said that was fine, she didn't like that answer and said it was bullshit. (How much do you want to bet she's going to do that, maybe not tomorrow but sometime in the near future, to try to \"get you\"?)\n\nLook, chicken salad isn't a five-course meal, she's acting like she slaved over a hot stove all day.
