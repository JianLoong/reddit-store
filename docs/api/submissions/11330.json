She's my best friend and I absolutely adore her, with one minor flaw, she is a huge workaholic/perfectionist.\n\nWhile we both have very well-paying jobs, Jen's job is way more stressful and time-demanding. Even though she is brilliant and amazing at what she does, she often works around the clock (on average, 60-hour weeks) at home and in office.\n\nThis wasn't a problem before, but about two weeks ago her doctor told her to take a step back from work (i.e., go on leave early) because the stress was starting to cause her a couple of health issues, even though the babies are fine.\n\nHowever, being the workaholic that she is, she has still been working from her laptop 6-8 hours every day. Which, fine, I understand that she had a couple of cases that she needed to finish. But most days she was so focused on work that she was forgetting to eat meals and falling asleep at her desk.\n\nSo, yesterday when I got home, I realized that she had done the same thing again. I woke her up and told her that she needed to go rest in bed. She insisted she was fine and said there was an emergency with a client of hers and she just needed to finalize some things for a coworker.\n\nI asked her just to take a break first and take a nap/eat, but she said that she would once she was done and that it wouldn't take her more than an hour. I told her fine, but no longer than an hour even though I was pretty annoyed.\n\nSo, two hours later when she was still working, I became frustrated and unplugged the Wi-Fi and put the cable out of sight. The only purpose of this was to cut her off from work on her laptop because she clearly had no intention of stopping.\n\nOnce she realized, she yelled at me, called me an AH, and she said that I was treating her like a child and accused me of being controlling, condescending, and \"borderline abusive.\"\n\nI told her that she is being stupid and just to let the coworker that asked for her help to handle it. I said that she was free to use the mobile hotspot on her phone, or figure out the router herself, but otherwise I would plug it back in when I woke up (which I did).\n\nShe was so mad that she slept in the guest room and when I went to apologize the next morning for calling her stupid (not for cutting the internet) she said that she can't even look at me. She hasn't said another word to me yet.\n\nI'm starting to feel like I might have been a bit extreme, even if I only did it out of concern. but honestly, overdoing it by trying to meet deadlines that she's not even supposed to be responsible for.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677793900, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11gf7s3/aita_for_shutting_off_the_home_wifi_so_that_my/", "score": 1481, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's my best friend and I absolutely adore her, with one minor flaw, she is a huge workaholic/perfectionist.\n\nWhile we both have very well-paying jobs, Jen's job is way more stressful and time-demanding. Even though she is brilliant and amazing at what she does, she often works around the clock (on average, 60-hour weeks) at home and in office.\n\nThis wasn't a problem before, but about two weeks ago her doctor told her to take a step back from work (i.e., go on leave early) because the stress was starting to cause her a couple of health issues, even though the babies are fine.\n\nHowever, being the workaholic that she is, she has still been working from her laptop 6-8 hours every day. Which, fine, I understand that she had a couple of cases that she needed to finish. But most days she was so focused on work that she was forgetting to eat meals and falling asleep at her desk.\n\nSo, yesterday when I got home, I realized that she had done the same thing again. I woke her up and told her that she needed to go rest in bed. She insisted she was fine and said there was an emergency with a client of hers and she just needed to finalize some things for a coworker.\n\nI asked her just to take a break first and take a nap/eat, but she said that she would once she was done and that it wouldn't take her more than an hour. I told her fine, but no longer than an hour even though I was pretty annoyed.\n\nSo, two hours later when she was still working, I became frustrated and unplugged the Wi-Fi and put the cable out of sight. The only purpose of this was to cut her off from work on her laptop because she clearly had no intention of stopping.\n\nOnce she realized, she yelled at me, called me an AH, and she said that I was treating her like a child and accused me of being controlling, condescending, and \"borderline abusive.\"\n\nI told her that she is being stupid and just to let the coworker that asked for her help to handle it. I said that she was free to use the mobile hotspot on her phone, or figure out the router herself, but otherwise I would plug it back in when I woke up (which I did).\n\nShe was so mad that she slept in the guest room and when I went to apologize the next morning for calling her stupid (not for cutting the internet) she said that she can't even look at me. She hasn't said another word to me yet.\n\nI'm starting to feel like I might have been a bit extreme, even if I only did it out of concern. but honestly, overdoing it by trying to meet deadlines that she's not even supposed to be responsible for.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Yes YTA. You could've easily brought her something to eat if you were worried about her eating and you need to apologize for cutting off the wifi and again for calling her stupid. Seriously", "Yta. Entitled, condescending ah", "YTA. \n\nShe\u2019s desperately trying to get things squared away before she goes on maternity leave and you\u2019re being ridiculous. \n\nPerhaps bring her food, some hot tea/coffee/water. \n\nWhat\u2019s going to happen when the babies come and she\u2019s exhausted? Instead of helping or doing something useful, are you going lecture her to take care of herself and then make it harder on her?", "Omg YTA. you might be jeopardizing her job because you feel your in the right. Have you considered she\u2019s trying to finish everything as fast as possible so when she gives birth she won\u2019t have to worry about the projects she\u2019s working on? How dare you try to dictate what she\u2019s doing. If your that worried how about helping her out. You say she\u2019s working and taking care of the house? How about you help her with her chores so she has one thing less to do. Your worried about her eating? Make her a sandwich and give it to her? She\u2019s not really hungry? Make her a fruit smoothie. Turning of things so she can\u2019t do her work isn\u2019t the way to go. Look I get your worried about her but this is whom she has always been and you knew that when you married her. You knew that before she got pregnant.", "Your wife is an adult capable of making her own decisions. You do not treat your life partner (emphasis on partner) this way. \n\nIf you have concerns about anything at all, you can COMMUNICATE about them. If she doesnt agree with your point of view, either be more persuasive next time or accept that maybe you aren\u2019t in control of her. \n\nUnplugging the wifi isn\u2019t the solution for anything here.", "YTA. She is a fully formed adult making adult decisions. You, presumably another adult, has this tool called \u201ccommunication\u201d. Sit her down, voice your legitimate, heartfelt concerns with love \n, non judgement and support and hope she makes healthy choices. You can\u2019t make decisions for her.", "YTA. You were being controlling and condescending and treating her like a child. She *has* cut her work back, she was sleeping and you woke her up, you called her stupid, you interfered with her work. \n\nAdd in that there's a *very* well-documented phenomenon of men becoming controlling and abusive towards their wives and girlfriends once they're pregnant or there are babies in the picture? Plus, y'know, that whole thing with pregnancy where the pregnant person's body suddenly gets treated like public property and everyone feels like they get to comment and touch and legislate? \n\nYou weren't doing anything helpful here. You were just making multiple things *harder* for her, while also indicating that you don't respect her judgement and don't think she has a right to control her body or her professional life. And then you insulted her for being mad about it. You want to be helpful? Bring her a fucking sandwich.", "YTA. You were controlling.\n\nThe problem with going on leave from work early as a professional is that setting things up for one to be out of office and beyond reach also takes time. Your wife told your that there was an emergency that would take an hour. The emergency is in part because your wife will soon be unavailable.\n\nAnd people are going to make comments about work being over bearing, but that\u2019s the nature of jobs like this\u2014Better pay for longer hours. \n\nThe appropriate thing was to have gone back in an hour to check on your wife and bring food. You could have reiterated your concerns and try to see if the issues could wait until morning or at least for a nap. The work clearly took more time than anticipated. That would have been a more than fair conversation to have. \n\nYou didn\u2019t do that though. You decided to do nothing other than get angrier for an hour and then removed wifi to punish your wife. You didn\u2019t reduce her stress levels. You had to have known that. You just tried to punish and control her.\n\nShe can\u2019t trust you. You\u2019ve shown that you won\u2019t respect her as an adult. Pregnancy is a key for abusers to reveal themselves because women can\u2019t leave as easily, and your behavior lines up with that of an abuser (even if that wasn\u2019t your intent). Your wife can and should have alarm bells going off right now over your actions. You need to understand just how bad they were. You might try to dress this up as concern over her health, but this reads as concern over her as a vessel for your children, not as an independent person. \n\nHer inability to trust you is going forward to cause more stress, which is bad for her, than her just finishing the work would have.", "Reasonable people don\u2019t think they have the authority or right to ground their spouse from the internet. That\u2019s a complete sentence. YTA", "Yta.

Who unplugs the wifi? You\u2019re treating her like a child which is borderline abusive.", "OP, I am sympathetic that being a partner to a pregnant person is stressful, particularly when faced with medical guidance such as what your wife has received, HOWEVER, what you done was abusive and controlling.\n\nIf you have concerns about your wife being stressed and not following the doctors advice have a respectful conversation with her, do things around the house to lighten her load and be a thoughtful and considerate partner. You went nuclear for no good reason.\n\nYTA", "YTA - you can\u2019t control her like that, she\u2019s not your child", "YTA.\nShe cut down her work and you\u2019re being controlling and abusive. Her dr said babies are fine. I shudder to think of how life will be for your wife and children soon when things don\u2019t go your way. \n\nFalling asleep and not eating when pregnant is common. Is she complaining about falling asleep because she\u2019s exhausted from work or is it because she is tired from being pregnant? When you are heavily pregnant, your organs are being pushed up towards your throat. You might find it impossible sometimes to eat. \n\nYou might think you\u2019re helping but you\u2019re not. Try asking her how you can help. Make her food, buy her snacks she can eat. Making sure she ends her work before her leave IS taking care of herself and the kiddos to make sure there IS a job when she comes back to work. \n\nStop controlling her body. If you wanted kiddos and to control the process, you should\u2019ve grown a uterus and impregnated yourself.", "YTA.

You cannot, and should not, use any type of mental emotional or physical control to get what you want in a healthy two way relationship. It is clear what you were doing and why, but the approach was wrong. Healthy adults use communication not coercion to find a solution. I am also somewhat concerned about the level of work your wife is doing while that pregnant with twins, but if that is the case you need to have a serious discussion where you have her undivided attention, not when she\u2019s working on a deadline that she believes is necessary and important, and you just up and take her capabilities.", "YTA Do you think preventing her from doing work she needs to isn\u2019t stressful?", "YTA - You literally caused her way more stress by cutting off her Wi-Fi.

She knows herself better than OP or any of us so she is in no way an asshole for doing what she thinks is best.", "The babies are fine. Nothing this woman is doing will cause any harm to the fetuses she is carrying. Many women work to the end of pregnancy - in the US, where maternity leave is craptastic, full time work right up until labor is extremely common. (I worked the day I went into labor the first time.) Whether or not pregnant people eat/eat the right things/eat on a schedule set by other people has a pretty limited impact on pregnancy. Folic acid, sure, but if that was a problem, it would be diagnosed by now. A pregnant person will have better general health if they eat extra during pregnancy, but the babies will suck the necessary nutrients out of her bones if they have to.\n\nIt is not clear why the OB in this case has suggested going on leave early. \"Stress\" is not a problem unless accompanied by specific symptoms. Is this woman having high blood pressure? Contractions? Are there concerns about placental location? There's not a huge difference between typing legal briefs and emails to colleagues and sitting around watching game shows, medically. We cannot stop people from thinking while leaving them conscious. If you want to spend your pregnancy practicing law, there is nothing about that that is inherently bad, even if you forget to eat sometimes. Eating isn't a lot of fun lately in pregnancy - the uterus takes most of the formerly stomach space, and the heartburn can be nightmarish.\n\nOne thing that is definitely unhealthy for pregnant women, also for most people, is bed rest. There are very limited situations in which bed rest is recommended, because it really does not take long for people on bed rest to lose muscle tone, and develop pressure ulcers, and there is a risk of forming blood clots in the legs, which can be fatal. And even people on bed rest (which is most safely managed in hospital, with pneumatic boots on) are allowed to type legal briefs, talk in the phone, and email colleagues. (I had to be on bed rest because of placenta previa in my last pregnancy. It sucked, the hospital food was horrific and I largely didn't eat, my baby was born by C-section at 32 weeks due to hemorrhage, but was a fantastic weight for gestational age at birth. That child is now 13 and indistinguishable from children born at full term.)\n\nI am all in favor of all people eating nutritious meals multiple times a day. If OP wants that to happen, he should help arrange it. \n\nI think it is reasonable for him to talk to his wife about her plans and ask if there's a way to get closer to the OB's recommendations. But what on earth is she supposed to be doing for the next 3-6 weeks until the babies are born?", "Agreed ESH. \n\n\u2018Im 20 weeks pregnant with a demanding job and a workaholic attitude. I emphasize with his wife a lot, it has been really really hard to let go and focus on my health and my child\u2019s health. My husband has been super honest and open with me. He kindly keeps me accountable to our shared commitment to have a healthy pregnancy with reminders and encouragement and a snack and hugs and a belief that I will make the right choices. It\u2019s tough\u2026.but so is being a human. \n\nShe needs to prioritize her health for her sake and her children\u2019s sake. Her husband needs to treat her like an adult (that he is going to co-parent with!) and not a child. \n\nESH.", "Agree. And the wife could give birth at any moment since she\u2019s PG with twins.
