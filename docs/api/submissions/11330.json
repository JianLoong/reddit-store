She's my best friend and I absolutely adore her, with one minor flaw, she is a huge workaholic/perfectionist.\n\nWhile we both have very well-paying jobs, Jen's job is way more stressful and time-demanding. Even though she is brilliant and amazing at what she does, she often works around the clock (on average, 60-hour weeks) at home and in office.\n\nThis wasn't a problem before, but about two weeks ago her doctor told her to take a step back from work (i.e., go on leave early) because the stress was starting to cause her a couple of health issues, even though the babies are fine.\n\nHowever, being the workaholic that she is, she has still been working from her laptop 6-8 hours every day. Which, fine, I understand that she had a couple of cases that she needed to finish. But most days she was so focused on work that she was forgetting to eat meals and falling asleep at her desk.\n\nSo, yesterday when I got home, I realized that she had done the same thing again. I woke her up and told her that she needed to go rest in bed. She insisted she was fine and said there was an emergency with a client of hers and she just needed to finalize some things for a coworker.\n\nI asked her just to take a break first and take a nap/eat, but she said that she would once she was done and that it wouldn't take her more than an hour. I told her fine, but no longer than an hour even though I was pretty annoyed.\n\nSo, two hours later when she was still working, I became frustrated and unplugged the Wi-Fi and put the cable out of sight. The only purpose of this was to cut her off from work on her laptop because she clearly had no intention of stopping.\n\nOnce she realized, she yelled at me, called me an AH, and she said that I was treating her like a child and accused me of being controlling, condescending, and \"borderline abusive.\"\n\nI told her that she is being stupid and just to let the coworker that asked for her help to handle it. I said that she was free to use the mobile hotspot on her phone, or figure out the router herself, but otherwise I would plug it back in when I woke up (which I did).\n\nShe was so mad that she slept in the guest room and when I went to apologize the next morning for calling her stupid (not for cutting the internet) she said that she can't even look at me. She hasn't said another word to me yet.\n\nI'm starting to feel like I might have been a bit extreme, even if I only did it out of concern. but honestly, overdoing it by trying to meet deadlines that she's not even supposed to be responsible for.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1677793900, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11gf7s3/aita_for_shutting_off_the_home_wifi_so_that_my/", "score": 300, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's my best friend and I absolutely adore her, with one minor flaw, she is a huge workaholic/perfectionist.\n\nWhile we both have very well-paying jobs, Jen's job is way more stressful and time-demanding. Even though she is brilliant and amazing at what she does, she often works around the clock (on average, 60-hour weeks) at home and in office.\n\nThis wasn't a problem before, but about two weeks ago her doctor told her to take a step back from work (i.e., go on leave early) because the stress was starting to cause her a couple of health issues, even though the babies are fine.\n\nHowever, being the workaholic that she is, she has still been working from her laptop 6-8 hours every day. Which, fine, I understand that she had a couple of cases that she needed to finish. But most days she was so focused on work that she was forgetting to eat meals and falling asleep at her desk.\n\nSo, yesterday when I got home, I realized that she had done the same thing again. I woke her up and told her that she needed to go rest in bed. She insisted she was fine and said there was an emergency with a client of hers and she just needed to finalize some things for a coworker.\n\nI asked her just to take a break first and take a nap/eat, but she said that she would once she was done and that it wouldn't take her more than an hour. I told her fine, but no longer than an hour even though I was pretty annoyed.\n\nSo, two hours later when she was still working, I became frustrated and unplugged the Wi-Fi and put the cable out of sight. The only purpose of this was to cut her off from work on her laptop because she clearly had no intention of stopping.\n\nOnce she realized, she yelled at me, called me an AH, and she said that I was treating her like a child and accused me of being controlling, condescending, and \"borderline abusive.\"\n\nI told her that she is being stupid and just to let the coworker that asked for her help to handle it. I said that she was free to use the mobile hotspot on her phone, or figure out the router herself, but otherwise I would plug it back in when I woke up (which I did).\n\nShe was so mad that she slept in the guest room and when I went to apologize the next morning for calling her stupid (not for cutting the internet) she said that she can't even look at me. She hasn't said another word to me yet.\n\nI'm starting to feel like I might have been a bit extreme, even if I only did it out of concern. but honestly, overdoing it by trying to meet deadlines that she's not even supposed to be responsible for.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "Yes YTA. You could've easily brought her something to eat if you were worried about her eating and you need to apologize for cutting off the wifi and again for calling her stupid. Seriously", "Yta. Entitled, condescending ah", "YTA. \n\nShe\u2019s desperately trying to get things squared away before she goes on maternity leave and you\u2019re being ridiculous. \n\nPerhaps bring her food, some hot tea/coffee/water. \n\nWhat\u2019s going to happen when the babies come and she\u2019s exhausted? Instead of helping or doing something useful, are you going lecture her to take care of herself and then make it harder on her?", "Omg YTA. you might be jeopardizing her job because you feel your in the right. Have you considered she\u2019s trying to finish everything as fast as possible so when she gives birth she won\u2019t have to worry about the projects she\u2019s working on? How dare you try to dictate what she\u2019s doing. If your that worried how about helping her out. You say she\u2019s working and taking care of the house? How about you help her with her chores so she has one thing less to do. Your worried about her eating? Make her a sandwich and give it to her? She\u2019s not really hungry? Make her a fruit smoothie. Turning of things so she can\u2019t do her work isn\u2019t the way to go. Look I get your worried about her but this is whom she has always been and you knew that when you married her. You knew that before she got pregnant.", "Your wife is an adult capable of making her own decisions. You do not treat your life partner (emphasis on partner) this way. \n\nIf you have concerns about anything at all, you can COMMUNICATE about them. If she doesnt agree with your point of view, either be more persuasive next time or accept that maybe you aren\u2019t in control of her. \n\nUnplugging the wifi isn\u2019t the solution for anything here.", "YTA. She is a fully formed adult making adult decisions. You, presumably another adult, has this tool called \u201ccommunication\u201d. Sit her down, voice your legitimate, heartfelt concerns with love \n, non judgement and support and hope she makes healthy choices. You can\u2019t make decisions for her.", "YTA. You were being controlling and condescending and treating her like a child. She *has* cut her work back, she was sleeping and you woke her up, you called her stupid, you interfered with her work. \n\nAdd in that there's a *very* well-documented phenomenon of men becoming controlling and abusive towards their wives and girlfriends once they're pregnant or there are babies in the picture? Plus, y'know, that whole thing with pregnancy where the pregnant person's body suddenly gets treated like public property and everyone feels like they get to comment and touch and legislate? \n\nYou weren't doing anything helpful here. You were just making multiple things *harder* for her, while also indicating that you don't respect her judgement and don't think she has a right to control her body or her professional life. And then you insulted her for being mad about it. You want to be helpful? Bring her a fucking sandwich.", "YTA. You were controlling.\n\nThe problem with going on leave from work early as a professional is that setting things up for one to be out of office and beyond reach also takes time. Your wife told your that there was an emergency that would take an hour. The emergency is in part because your wife will soon be unavailable.\n\nAnd people are going to make comments about work being over bearing, but that\u2019s the nature of jobs like this\u2014Better pay for longer hours. \n\nThe appropriate thing was to have gone back in an hour to check on your wife and bring food. You could have reiterated your concerns and try to see if the issues could wait until morning or at least for a nap. The work clearly took more time than anticipated. That would have been a more than fair conversation to have. \n\nYou didn\u2019t do that though. You decided to do nothing other than get angrier for an hour and then removed wifi to punish your wife. You didn\u2019t reduce her stress levels. You had to have known that. You just tried to punish and control her.\n\nShe can\u2019t trust you. You\u2019ve shown that you won\u2019t respect her as an adult. Pregnancy is a key for abusers to reveal themselves because women can\u2019t leave as easily, and your behavior lines up with that of an abuser (even if that wasn\u2019t your intent). Your wife can and should have alarm bells going off right now over your actions. You need to understand just how bad they were. You might try to dress this up as concern over her health, but this reads as concern over her as a vessel for your children, not as an independent person. \n\nHer inability to trust you is going forward to cause more stress, which is bad for her, than her just finishing the work would have.", "Reasonable people don\u2019t think they have the authority or right to ground their spouse from the internet. That\u2019s a complete sentence. YTA", "Yta.

Who unplugs the wifi? You\u2019re treating her like a child which is borderline abusive.", "OP, I am sympathetic that being a partner to a pregnant person is stressful, particularly when faced with medical guidance such as what your wife has received, HOWEVER, what you done was abusive and controlling.\n\nIf you have concerns about your wife being stressed and not following the doctors advice have a respectful conversation with her, do things around the house to lighten her load and be a thoughtful and considerate partner. You went nuclear for no good reason.\n\nYTA", "YTA - you can\u2019t control her like that, she\u2019s not your child", "YTA.\nShe cut down her work and you\u2019re being controlling and abusive. Her dr said babies are fine. I shudder to think of how life will be for your wife and children soon when things don\u2019t go your way. \n\nFalling asleep and not eating when pregnant is common. Is she complaining about falling asleep because she\u2019s exhausted from work or is it because she is tired from being pregnant? When you are heavily pregnant, your organs are being pushed up towards your throat. You might find it impossible sometimes to eat. \n\nYou might think you\u2019re helping but you\u2019re not. Try asking her how you can help. Make her food, buy her snacks she can eat. Making sure she ends her work before her leave IS taking care of herself and the kiddos to make sure there IS a job when she comes back to work. \n\nStop controlling her body. If you wanted kiddos and to control the process, you should\u2019ve grown a uterus and impregnated yourself.", "YTA.

You cannot, and should not, use any type of mental emotional or physical control to get what you want in a healthy two way relationship. It is clear what you were doing and why, but the approach was wrong. Healthy adults use communication not coercion to find a solution. I am also somewhat concerned about the level of work your wife is doing while that pregnant with twins, but if that is the case you need to have a serious discussion where you have her undivided attention, not when she\u2019s working on a deadline that she believes is necessary and important, and you just up and take her capabilities.", "YTA Do you think preventing her from doing work she needs to isn\u2019t stressful?", "YTA - You literally caused her way more stress by cutting off her Wi-Fi.

That\u2019s all I mean \ud83d\ude42", "So unplugging the Wi-Fi isn\u2019t stressing her out to the max?", "I'm just so bad at conflict lol.  My brain goes AAAAAA.", "And you can be concerned. You can\u2019t control your wife though. Also, he caused MORE stress, which could harm the babies\u2026since that\u2019s all he is worried about now.", "If you notice, I didn't say he was right. I just pointed out that she was indeed endangering her and her babies health. Of course, the first thing he should have done is give her food.", "Yes, she cut down on work, thats why OP keeps finding here sleeping next to her computer. Unless she has narcolepsy no one will just randomly decide to sleep on their computer, you only do that if you have been working on it for hours.", "On my second pregnancy and she can get hypertension, she could have a stroke, everything is more serious when pregnant. She should be thinking of her babies right now, their health should be the most important thing. They're viable but if she goes into early labor it's going to suck for everyone involved.", "she literally said she would work one hour, 2 hours later he cut off the internet. She has a serious work problem and needs professional help.", "Even if you are right about the argument generally (which you aren't) divorcing over one fight would be an overreaction. People like you are the reason this sub can be so insufferable.", "And when they do it willingly, and without regret, they're 100% the AH.", "No, im not saying that. All im saying is stress can lead to serious health issues. working all the time causes stress, being pregnant causes stress, stress can lead to a heart attack, a stroke, a miscarriage for example. OP is worried that wife is working all the time and has suffered from stress. Working less and taking more breaks would lessen the load wife has, I\u2019m not saying she can\u2019t work and i agree being pregnant is difficult which is why i am saying that she shouldn\u2019t work so hard that she gets exhausted. I\u2019m also not saying that this was the best way to go about but sometimes going to an extreme measure can get a point across.", "But the doctor told her to take it easy", "I'm sure it is. But it also doesn't make her any less of a co-AH.", "Hamster stops running for me too I just close app", "Oh for sure he approached the situation in one of the worst ways possible. That's why I would go for ESH. Him for lacking empathy and awareness, her for ignoring common sense and doctor's advice while pregnant with two children", "I fell asleep at my computer when in office while pregnant on more than 1 occasion. I was just so damn tired, that putting my head down for a min lead to sleep. \n\nThere was nothing medically wrong. I had a very healthy pregnancy, I was just tired.", "And that's a cause for *concern,* not adding to the stress like OP did.", "And if she was at that point her OBGYN would have put her on bedrest. I had severe complications with my second and almost died giving birth. \n\nIf OP truly wanted to reduce stress he wouldn't have done something to stress her out more. He wasn't thinking of his babies when he added to it.", "He called her stupid, is engaging in behaviors that could get her fired (making her financially dependent), and controlling her.  This isn\u2019t one argument.  This is multiple red flags of abuse. More women are murdered by their husbands/spouses than by strangers. And pregnant women have a higher risk of dying by homicide.  She is vulnerable right now, and they are both stressed.  And his reaction to stress is to escalate.  None of this is good.", "There's literally people out there drinking and doing drugs while pregnant. All she's doing is working. Understandably she should cut back and soon, since the babies will be there soon, but him turning off the internet like a child is worsening the situation and solving absolutely nothing.", "Nope, treating someone like a child rarely gets a point across. This will backfire on him. She could choose to go to a hotel for the rest of the pregnancy so that he doesn't even get to know what she does all day. Like someone said above, she doesn't lose her autonomy just because she's pregnant.", "yeah he said, not demanded and cut off her wifi", "If your doctor told you to eat less fried food does that give your spouse the right to throw away your fried chicken?", "Yes, so if you are so damn tired, exhausted and stressed the last think I would expect someone to do is work for stupid hours a day.", "Yes, working all the time was and is a massive cause of stress, for anyone. It can be dangerous and even life threatening if it hets bad enough, that coupled with a baby and soon going to be giving birth to that baby will cause even more stress on top of that, but you clearly don\u2019t know basic medicine and health.", "He definitely didn't handle this the correct way AT ALL but I believe he did it from a genuine place of fear. Her Dr warned her she was starting to show signs of health issues, which I would guess is blood pressure related. She strikes me as someone who wouldn't realize a headache isn't normal until she ends up in the hospital with eclampsia or full blown HELLP.", "She's already been diagnosed with two stress related issues while 8 months pregnant, and her doctor told her to go on early maternity leave because elevated stress can be dangerous to her and their unborn children. \n\nIs OP an AH for shutting off the WiFi while she was working? Yes.\n\nIs OP's wife also an AH for ignoring doctor's orders, and putting her life and the life of their unborn children at risk for the sake of her job? Also yes.", "Ok at this point I need to chime in. Anorexia is the most deadly mental illness. Not eating is SUPER BAD FOR YOU. I literally couldn't imagine not eating while your bodies nutrients are being leeched. This is setting OPs wife up for a LOT of trouble down the line, both for her and her babes.  \nWomen lose some calcium from their bones during a normal, healthy pregnancy.. if she's just straight up not eating thats a problem.  \n\n\nJust because she's not drunk, doesnt mean she's taking proper care of her children or herself.", "40 hrs?  In most places, that's expected. She dropped from 60 to 32-40.", "I've had multiple kids. I've gone through pregnancy with severe complications and a birth that almost killed me. I clearly know a lot more than you. Enough to know what OBGYNs do in severe cases.", "She did cut her work hours.", "No one is suggesting that she's making good decisions, only that OP doesn't have the right to treat her like a misbehaving child just because she's pregnant.", "Yes and i would normally accept that in a normal case. If the wife was fine and not suffering from so much stress i would call OP the AH, but she isnt. She is damaged herself by working to much. And she is ignoring a doctor\u2019s recommendation to work less due to that stress. Continuing could cause damage to the wife and by extension the baby.", "Dr says work less. Wife drops her hours by 20+ hours a week. She literally followed Dr's orders. \n\nBeing exhausted while growing humans is normal. There is nothing to this story that indicates a lack of following Dr orders or harm to herself or the babies. In fact she is now within the normal range for delivering twins, which indicates she has done just fine."]}
