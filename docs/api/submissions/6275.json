Does she end up with more than 50% of the work even with a maid? Offering a washing machine is great, but that doesn\u2019t ease the load of actually doing the laundry. I can imagine that for her, it\u2019s insulting and irritating to watch your partner kick back and enjoy time off when she has to come home from work just to continue working by cleaning the house. I suspect that when you originally talked about it, she didn\u2019t realise the full extent of what that would mean for your life together\u2014but she should have done more introspection before agreeing.\n\nOn the other hand, if you think you\u2019re the AH because you won\u2019t even try, then absolutely.

Someone has to plan the meals, buy & prepare the food, & clean up afterwards. I have no idea why your wife married you. The two of you were together long enough before your marriage that she could see how this would go. However, incompetence is never an attractive quality.
