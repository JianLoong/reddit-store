I think your step mother is so far wrong its not funny, when your working for your dad, your not his daughter, your his employee.  How your treated, in contrast to other workers really makes you look how your being treated.  You have seen what they get, and what you get, and decided to move onto the next chapter of your working life.  You informed your boss, that you was looking for other work, and handed in your resignation, like any other employee.  Your step mother has absolutely no right to interfere with the business, unless she is a business partner.  The thing is you are your fathers daughter, and I imagine, you don't want to get your father in trouble, the below minimum wage thing, could dependent on the country could end the company.  So you moving company is actually helping him avoid getting him and his company into trouble, or jail time for him.", "NTA, the only one that\u2019s going to look out for you is you.

Business is business, and at your dad\u2019s company you were being paid less than minimum wage.

Of course the abusers are upset that they don't have control over your life and can't take pleasure in seeing you financially struggle anymore.  \n\n   You sacrificed enough and it will never be enough for them.

They have been taking advantage of you.  Perhaps it's because they believe family should make sacrifices for family and would do the same in your position, but the end result is the same.

I said fuck them and their opinions of me a long time ago but they still feel the need to scream at me even though I haven't been asking for help or anything else for that matter in years.. it always comes to the same bullishit of we raised you, we paid for university, we didn't throw you out like your mother", "I\u2019m sorry to hear that.\nJust keep working on your own life.\n\nBeing raised as a kid is totally nothing you should feel guilty about or that you owe anyone anything.
