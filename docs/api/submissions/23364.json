About a year after the divorce, his ex-wife was posting pics of vacations, a new car, etc. He was fuming, because he was living paycheck to paycheck, and was worried that she was blowing all the money, including the child support, on a lavish lifestyle.

He deserves to be paying all that money to her for what he did. You should have kept yourself out of it.", "This must be different where you are. My understanding is that alimony continues until either a specified date or the person receiving it gets married.", "You are NTA at all - you did what was right.", "YTA.", "You're weirdly invested in his ex. Why? Your cousin probably spent a fortune on his addictions and cheating and she was getting compensated for what he did while they were married. He destroyed their family. So why are you so invested in hurting her after what he did to her? Sure she may have been gaming the system, sure your cousin is getting therapy, but your cousin put her through hell. Him getting therapy after everything he did to her doesn't change the damage he did.", ">Additionally, alimony may be time limited. For example, my uncle received alimony for something like 2 years.\n\nIt should always be time limited imo. No reason for you to provide someone lifetime support when your lifetime commitment of marriage ended."]}
