Your dad was handling the argument with your mother just fine.

You sound like an entitled jerk. Not to mention disrespectful. Maybe if you're lucky your mother will move out and leave you with your father. How dare you demand she get a job with what you are taking from them. Keep interfering, and I see a divorce in the future.", "NTA. It seems like your mom has a serious spending problem, and rather than adjust her own habits, she wants to shift the blame to you. Her insistence that you pay for your own car issues would be a fair point, since you agreed that you wouldn't pay rent, not necessarily that all of your expenses would be covered, but it's obviously colored by the fact that she can't control her spending and she really doesn't have a leg to stand on since she's not the one really supporting you anyway, your dad is. It's a hard truth, and it may sour your relationship for a while because she doesn't understand it, but you're not the asshole for saying it.", "YTA telling your mom to get a job while also pointing out ONE thing she bought for you after surgery belittled her and took away from your point. if you'd just called out all the spending on pointless stuff that you mentioned I'd say differently but telling her to get a job and also implying you aren't properly cared for (the adult who lives at home and is supported by her parents) is too far. it was your dad's job to handle his marriage not yours.", "YTA for dissing your mom like that and butting into your parents argument however, your mom is also the ass for attempting to renege on the agreement. \n\nIf your Dad wants to spoil his wife then thats his business and not yours especially since they are helping you in your time of need. \n\nBut if you ask me, sounds like your dad is a pushover and your mom is a major hoarder and shopaholic\u2026.

Since all you can control is you, mind your own business, get a job, fix your own car, and pay for your own stuff.", "YTA! Big time. You actually told your mom to \u201cget off her ass\u201d?! That\u2019s your mother - have some damn respect. \n\nShe has a spending problem, but the audacity you have criticizing her for causing your dad financial stress, when you yourself are allowing him to pay for your car parts while you live there RENT-FREE. \n\nGet off YOUR ass and get a low-level job until you find your dream job. And apologize to your mom.", "You told her to get off her ass and use her own money. Meanwhile, you admit job hunting hasn't been going well for yourself and your entire reason for living with them is to save money.\n\nYour Dad was finally talking to her about the spending. The agreement may have been for you to not pay anything, but before that conversation- your Mom hadn't been told anything about her spending either! This is their marriage or relationship, and I imagine there was an agreement or understanding between them that your Dad that he works and she doesn't. He had never raised that concern with her before, so while she's oblivious and careless with that money- that is up to them\n\nYour Dad was finally talking to her about the spending. He had your back and was reminding her of the agreement. You should have let him handle the conversation with his wife/partner, because you came across as an entitled AH. Asking her to get a job and use her own money for her shopping so you can live for free and get financial help from Dad's money?\n\nIf anything, I would have focused on the spending. Your Dad works hard, and he's expressing displeasure with what she spent it on - that's something for them to discuss and work out, as budget is something to discuss with your partner. If I were to speak up I'd say something about the unnecessary spending that Dad works really hard for,  that he should have some say of where it's spent and he wanted to honor the ageeement made with you and help you out as well. \n\nThe way you came across was a bit entitled and an AH. You could have had your Dad's back in terms of budget, spending the money Dad has been working hard for on needs vs useless items. That I could understand, but the fact this came after she dare ask their adult, unemployed child to pay for their own car repairs? It wasn't the best move and absolutely came across as an entitled AH, and likely only strengthened her opinion on you paying for it yourself. It's not only up to her though, so good thing Dad has your back.", "YTA. \n\nYou inserted yourself into an argument between your parents with telling your mom to get off \"her ass\" and get a job and then pointed out that basically the only useful things she buys are things for you. She has a shopping problem, your dad has an enabling problem but those issues are their issues for them to work out. Your comment was not helpful or constructive. \n\nAdditionally, your parents may have long disagreed about allowing adult children to live rent free, including your sister.

Your mom probably needs therapy if she is hoarding that badly, maybe looking into some minimalist philosophy might help her?  That\u2019s what saved my wife from really debt trapping us with it.  Hoarding can destroy families and you and your parents need to have an open level headed discussion about this.", "NTA, you were honest and told the truth.

Like boxes of them.

My parent bought my twin sister a car and covered the cost of it while she was staying at home. I bought my car car off FB for cheap because I didn\u2019t want them to worry about, and if something breaks me and my dad fix it. They pay for both of our insurance since mine would be crazy as a young male. Her biggest issue is that she is used to spending this much when she worked and was making almost as much as my dad before they moved when we went to college. She then said she was going to wait to get a job because of the VID, and since then has openly admitted that she doesn\u2019t want one.", "Nah I disagree, something had to be said. It may not have been the most tactful but behavior like what he described is going to burn his dad out and it's clear the dad didn't have the courage to say it himself. \n\nThis type of bad financial behavior is how families lose their homes. When his dad, an engineer, is struggling for gas money you've got big problems.", "It\u2019s become OP\u2019s responsibility because she is being asked to support the household financially due to her mums reckless spending. It\u2019s also not fair for her to to help with bills since her sister didn\u2019t have to do the same", "My dad and I are very close, we got to each other for everything and he needed someone to talk to that he knew wouldn\u2019t run off and tell my mother. My dad wanted to talk to his adult son about something that was bothering him, not a kid. My parents have rarely  hidden arguments from me or my twin. If the are arguing about something and we can hear it, then we will step in and tell them what we think. \n\nThe job think for me has been hard because as I mentioned, I had to have an emergency surgery back in October. It wasn\u2019t until almost Christmas that I was cleared because a few of my incisions weren\u2019t closing. I\u2019m looking for a job now but without a car it\u2019s not going to help. \n\nAs for my car. I had said in another comment that my parents bought my sister a car and paid $300 a month for almost 2 years until she moved out. I bought my own car off FB and the most expensive repair that needed done was $250. My dad wants to buy the parts and stuff it fix it to make up for them getting my sister a car and not me.", "I don't think OP is entitled. I believe OP reacted intensely to hearing that his dad was struggling to have gas money. TBH if I was in that situation I would have a major WTF moment. Hell I work in tech and if my wife was spending like crazy and we were living paycheck to paycheck I'd be glad if someone jumped in and said \"woah... You guys are fucking up hard\"", "I wasn\u2019t saying that the only useful thing she buys are things for me. I\u2019ve actually told her NOT to buy me things because if I wanted them then I\u2019ll buy them when I can. She will just randomly buy me things that I don\u2019t need and have asked her not to because I won\u2019t have the space for them when I move.

Most nights it\u2019s when we\u2019re working on my car or just going out and doing stuff. He\u2019s straight up shown me their accounts and stuff. \n\nI said this in another comment, but my mom is USED to when she worked and was making almost the same amount as my dad at her last job before they moved.

And I don't care how close you and dad are.  He should not be involving you in their marriage.  I don't complain to my mom about my marriage.", "I think your dad needs to stop talking to you and sit the wife down and budget with her. She needs to know what she's financially doing to the budget, and if she wants to spend money on frivolous things, then she can get a part-time job, and that will be her spending money. I think that another agreement is to sell anything in the storage unit as no one needs stuff in a storage unit. It's not being used and it's time to let go. She sounds like a hoarder.", "NTA but you also need to tell your Dad to stop dumping his problems with your Mom on you and confront your Mom directly if he is having issues with her spending. Him unloading his complaints on you does nothing but cause, I'm sure unintended, harm on your relationship with her while he continues to dodge the issue to keep the peace between them. I speak with some experience. Parents venting their frustrations with the other on their kids eventually starts to taint ones view of them. IMO, we aren't supposed to be their therapists or mediators no matter what age we are.", "NTA she has some serious issues", "NTA\n\nThey offered for you to stay without paying and you accepted. You've been trying to get a job, but unexpected health issues are making that difficult. Were you a bit harsh? Undoubtedly, but she had just lost her temper and tried to punish you by making you pay to live with them, so you're excused. You're not at fault here, I really don't get all these ESH comments.\n\nYour Mother clearly has some kind of compulsive disorder, from what your Dad said about needing the money to fix your car it sounds like she's drained at least one bank account. She buys multiples of the same item, though I'm guessing different brands, and never uses most of them. In fact a good amount of it is stored elsewhere, in a storage facility they have to pay for. Addicts don't like to be questioned, and the moment your Dad did so, she 'lost it' and tried to take back their offer to house you for free.\n\nYour Dad is definitely enabling her. He's working long hours to fund her addiction, and that's not going to change as they get older. He needs to put his foot down, take control of their finances, and convince Mum to go to therapy. Perhaps a therapist and a part time job would help? If your mother hasn't worked in some time, going back could be very daunting.\n\nThe biggest thing here is therapy. Support her, maybe apologise for the words you used, but make it very clear to her that this cannot continue. With the help of a good therapist, she should eventually get control of her compulsive spending, hopefully be able to return to work, and sell off all those hoarded items!\n\nBe gentle, but firm.

Telling your child to contribute financially when you know damn well she doesn\u2019t have a job is just rude. Mom wanted a reaction and she got one. One jobless person telling another jobless person to get a job is the epitome of hypocrisy.", "OP gets a pass because they're a young college student still trying to figure life out; they're also searching for a job, unlike their mother.", "Because it's causing her father distress.

Everyone thinks of hoarders having piles of crap and garbage everywhere, but it presents differently in people. I have family who own two fridges and keep both stuffed full of food. Plus a huge pantry. It's more than they could ever eat, and they keep it clean, but it's anxiety based. Their brother does the same thing with his old things, he just isn't a compulsive buyer.

I overlooked that part as I was  focussed on Dad wanting to pay for OPs car. I think the fustration with the spending is valid - it's irresponsible and awful that she blows money on stupid things. If OP wasn't living at home rent free to save money and Dad didn't mention wanting to use that money for the car, I would absolutely think it's reasonable to get this upset and say what they said. It's valid for anyone to think it's ridiculous and fustrating. It's really only the fact that it seemed to escalate when Mom suggested that OP should be paying for their own car and perhaps rent that made me think it was moreso entitled. If Dad needed that money for gas and is struggling financially, even though Mom needs to spend less and is an AH for thinking that spending is OK, it still seems a bit entitled to me suggest the solution for OP being able to live rent free as per a previous agreement is that Mom gets a job so Dad help financially. Situations change, and while I'd be upset and annoyed that I was told I could live rent free and now money trouble that was likely avoidable and caused by frivolous spending may prevent that, it doesn't change the current financial situation they're in. I wouldn't expect a previous agreement to be upheld and would want my Dad to save up money for himself before extending himself more. He clearly is a bit of a pushover and allowed Mom to spend so much, so I wouldn't trust that he is even in a position to help financially and that he just doesn't want to go back on the agreement, just like he didn't want to tell Mom to cut the spending down. \n\nAnd while Mom may have been the one spending and we all judge her for it, Dad never spoke up until then so he is at fault as well. He allowed it to happen by never saying this spending was an issue, that financially it's tough for them, etc. I would assume most adults should know better so I feel like Mom is an AH,  but she has gotten away with it for so long, never heard that it was a problem or a complaint so why would she think it's a problem? She may be irresponsible and buy stupid things, but Dad is irresponsible as well by not speaking up and letting her spend money, agreeing for OP to live rent free and offer car help despite knowing he's not in a great financial spot. If Mom had been told before that financially her spending is a problem, then maybe she would have stopped before. Dad should have spoken up earlier and since he never has before then, while it seems obvious her spending is an issue, it seems unfair to go so hard on her alone. It seems entitled to get upset about this only after it means OP may not get financial help with their car or still expect them to hold up the agreement.", "I get he doesn't want to hurt her but at what cost, financial ruin?

Your parents shouldn't be responsible for paying for repairs for your personal vehicle. That's your responsibility, and if you can't afford the repairs, perhaps cut down your college to part time for the time being, take a part time job, and either get a bicycle or use public transportation.\n\nThird...your father's been overly permissive with your mother's excessive spending, and as the sole breadwinner, he has every right to cut off her credit card and limit her to an allowance. He needs to man up and do this, if her expenditures are placing such a financial burden on him. Her behavior strikes me as her being a bit of a pack rat.
