Your dad was handling the argument with your mother just fine.

You sound like an entitled jerk. Not to mention disrespectful. Maybe if you're lucky your mother will move out and leave you with your father. How dare you demand she get a job with what you are taking from them. Keep interfering, and I see a divorce in the future.", "NTA. It seems like your mom has a serious spending problem, and rather than adjust her own habits, she wants to shift the blame to you. Her insistence that you pay for your own car issues would be a fair point, since you agreed that you wouldn't pay rent, not necessarily that all of your expenses would be covered, but it's obviously colored by the fact that she can't control her spending and she really doesn't have a leg to stand on since she's not the one really supporting you anyway, your dad is. It's a hard truth, and it may sour your relationship for a while because she doesn't understand it, but you're not the asshole for saying it.", "YTA telling your mom to get a job while also pointing out ONE thing she bought for you after surgery belittled her and took away from your point. if you'd just called out all the spending on pointless stuff that you mentioned I'd say differently but telling her to get a job and also implying you aren't properly cared for (the adult who lives at home and is supported by her parents) is too far. it was your dad's job to handle his marriage not yours.", "YTA for dissing your mom like that and butting into your parents argument however, your mom is also the ass for attempting to renege on the agreement. \n\nIf your Dad wants to spoil his wife then thats his business and not yours especially since they are helping you in your time of need. \n\nBut if you ask me, sounds like your dad is a pushover and your mom is a major hoarder and shopaholic\u2026.

That\u2019s your mother - have some damn respect. \n\nShe has a spending problem, but the audacity you have criticizing her for causing your dad financial stress, when you yourself are allowing him to pay for your car parts while you live there RENT-FREE. \n\nGet off YOUR ass and get a low-level job until you find your dream job. And apologize to your mom.", "You told her to get off her ass and use her own money. Meanwhile, you admit job hunting hasn't been going well for yourself and your entire reason for living with them is to save money.\n\nYour Dad was finally talking to her about the spending. The agreement may have been for you to not pay anything, but before that conversation- your Mom hadn't been told anything about her spending either! This is their marriage or relationship, and I imagine there was an agreement or understanding between them that your Dad that he works and she doesn't. He had never raised that concern with her before, so while she's oblivious and careless with that money- that is up to them\n\nYour Dad was finally talking to her about the spending. He had your back and was reminding her of the agreement. You should have let him handle the conversation with his wife/partner, because you came across as an entitled AH. Asking her to get a job and use her own money for her shopping so you can live for free and get financial help from Dad's money?\n\nIf anything, I would have focused on the spending. Your Dad works hard, and he's expressing displeasure with what she spent it on - that's something for them to discuss and work out, as budget is something to discuss with your partner. If I were to speak up I'd say something about the unnecessary spending that Dad works really hard for,  that he should have some say of where it's spent and he wanted to honor the ageeement made with you and help you out as well. \n\nThe way you came across was a bit entitled and an AH. You could have had your Dad's back in terms of budget, spending the money Dad has been working hard for on needs vs useless items. That I could understand, but the fact this came after she dare ask their adult, unemployed child to pay for their own car repairs? It wasn't the best move and absolutely came across as an entitled AH, and likely only strengthened her opinion on you paying for it yourself. It's not only up to her though, so good thing Dad has your back.", "YTA. \n\nYou inserted yourself into an argument between your parents with telling your mom to get off \"her ass\" and get a job and then pointed out that basically the only useful things she buys are things for you. She has a shopping problem, your dad has an enabling problem but those issues are their issues for them to work out. Your comment was not helpful or constructive. \n\nAdditionally, your parents may have long disagreed about allowing adult children to live rent free, including your sister.

Your mom probably needs therapy if she is hoarding that badly, maybe looking into some minimalist philosophy might help her?  That\u2019s what saved my wife from really debt trapping us with it.  Hoarding can destroy families and you and your parents need to have an open level headed discussion about this.", "NTA, you were honest and told the truth.

Like boxes of them.

My parent bought my twin sister a car and covered the cost of it while she was staying at home. I bought my car car off FB for cheap because I didn\u2019t want them to worry about, and if something breaks me and my dad fix it. They pay for both of our insurance since mine would be crazy as a young male. Her biggest issue is that she is used to spending this much when she worked and was making almost as much as my dad before they moved when we went to college. She then said she was going to wait to get a job because of the VID, and since then has openly admitted that she doesn\u2019t want one.", "Nah I disagree, something had to be said. It may not have been the most tactful but behavior like what he described is going to burn his dad out and it's clear the dad didn't have the courage to say it himself. \n\nThis type of bad financial behavior is how families lose their homes. When his dad, an engineer, is struggling for gas money you've got big problems.", "It\u2019s become OP\u2019s responsibility because she is being asked to support the household financially due to her mums reckless spending. It\u2019s also not fair for her to to help with bills since her sister didn\u2019t have to do the same", "My dad and I are very close, we got to each other for everything and he needed someone to talk to that he knew wouldn\u2019t run off and tell my mother. My dad wanted to talk to his adult son about something that was bothering him, not a kid. My parents have rarely  hidden arguments from me or my twin. If the are arguing about something and we can hear it, then we will step in and tell them what we think. \n\nThe job think for me has been hard because as I mentioned, I had to have an emergency surgery back in October. It wasn\u2019t until almost Christmas that I was cleared because a few of my incisions weren\u2019t closing. I\u2019m looking for a job now but without a car it\u2019s not going to help. \n\nAs for my car. I had said in another comment that my parents bought my sister a car and paid $300 a month for almost 2 years until she moved out. I bought my own car off FB and the most expensive repair that needed done was $250. My dad wants to buy the parts and stuff it fix it to make up for them getting my sister a car and not me.", "I don't think OP is entitled. I believe OP reacted intensely to hearing that his dad was struggling to have gas money. TBH if I was in that situation I would have a major WTF moment.

You guys are fucking up hard\"", "I wasn\u2019t saying that the only useful thing she buys are things for me. I\u2019ve actually told her NOT to buy me things because if I wanted them then I\u2019ll buy them when I can.

Most nights it\u2019s when we\u2019re working on my car or just going out and doing stuff. He\u2019s straight up shown me their accounts and stuff. \n\nI said this in another comment, but my mom is USED to when she worked and was making almost the same amount as my dad at her last job before they moved.

Might be worth looking into that.", "How much are you paying?", "Well, if you\u2019re buttoned up on the car thing too, then yeah, I think you\u2019re fully in the right to be critical. Your dad should have been the one to give her the reality check, and obviously it would have been better handled as less of an argument and more of an honest conversation, but it\u2019s wrong to promise you one thing about what would be expected of you and then shift blame to you for not pulling your weight when she\u2019s the one being questioned.", "Nope.

So did my Mum and my Nan. So do I to a degree. One of us has it under control (I want the things but don\u2019t buy them). The difference isn\u2019t income, it\u2019s therapy. All of us had instabilities in childhood where we felt insecure around possessions, money and food. Mostly because unstable home life.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of reasons to compulsive shop and a therapist is the person to figure that out. Your Mum going back to work and having more funds won\u2019t stop the issues. Somewhere in her brain she needs these things to feel stable, safe and secure. Talk to your Dad about that.", "Seconding that. OP, maybe check out r/hoarding for resources about how to recognise and effectively talk to a hoarder.", "It could also be Compulsive Buying Disorder,  which essentially is a shopping addiction.

And I don't care how close you and dad are.  He should not be involving you in their marriage.  I don't complain to my mom about my marriage.", "I think your dad needs to stop talking to you and sit the wife down and budget with her. She needs to know what she's financially doing to the budget, and if she wants to spend money on frivolous things, then she can get a part-time job, and that will be her spending money. I think that another agreement is to sell anything in the storage unit as no one needs stuff in a storage unit. It's not being used and it's time to let go. She sounds like a hoarder.", "NTA but you also need to tell your Dad to stop dumping his problems with your Mom on you and confront your Mom directly if he is having issues with her spending. Him unloading his complaints on you does nothing but cause, I'm sure unintended, harm on your relationship with her while he continues to dodge the issue to keep the peace between them. I speak with some experience. Parents venting their frustrations with the other on their kids eventually starts to taint ones view of them. IMO, we aren't supposed to be their therapists or mediators no matter what age we are.", "NTA she has some serious issues", "NTA\n\nThey offered for you to stay without paying and you accepted. You've been trying to get a job, but unexpected health issues are making that difficult. Were you a bit harsh? Undoubtedly, but she had just lost her temper and tried to punish you by making you pay to live with them, so you're excused. You're not at fault here, I really don't get all these ESH comments.\n\nYour Mother clearly has some kind of compulsive disorder, from what your Dad said about needing the money to fix your car it sounds like she's drained at least one bank account. She buys multiples of the same item, though I'm guessing different brands, and never uses most of them. In fact a good amount of it is stored elsewhere, in a storage facility they have to pay for. Addicts don't like to be questioned, and the moment your Dad did so, she 'lost it' and tried to take back their offer to house you for free.\n\nYour Dad is definitely enabling her. He's working long hours to fund her addiction, and that's not going to change as they get older. He needs to put his foot down, take control of their finances, and convince Mum to go to therapy. Perhaps a therapist and a part time job would help? If your mother hasn't worked in some time, going back could be very daunting.\n\nThe biggest thing here is therapy. Support her, maybe apologise for the words you used, but make it very clear to her that this cannot continue. With the help of a good therapist, she should eventually get control of her compulsive spending, hopefully be able to return to work, and sell off all those hoarded items!\n\nBe gentle, but firm. Good luck, OP.", "NTA.  Your mom is a compulsive buyer and is displaying hoarder tendencies.  She needs therapy ASAP.", "NTA she\u2019s forcing your dad to work over 50 hours a week for her greed . It\u2019s not his fault and it\u2019s not yours", "NTA mum is entitled to spending what they don't have on crap they don't need. If she wants to be a spender, she should earn her own money. Dad needs to tell her she needs to curb her spending.", "NTA..  she had it coming..  Your father should take her cards, give her a allowance and should have cancelled that Amazon order.", "You mean the adult child who is actively looking for and applying for jobs but haven\u2019t had any luck landing a job yet? You sound like someone who has never had a tough job hunt. \n\nI think it became her business when her mom lashed out and involved her in an argument she didn\u2019t start. Telling your child to contribute financially when you know damn well she doesn\u2019t have a job is just rude. Mom wanted a reaction and she got one. One jobless person telling another jobless person to get a job is the epitome of hypocrisy.", "OP gets a pass because they're a young college student still trying to figure life out; she's also searching for a job, unlike their mother.", "Because it's causing her father distress. Would you turn a blind eye if your mom started mistreating your dad or vice versa?\n\nShe's right to look out for someone she loves, she handled it wrong.", "It is incredibly inappropriate that you got involved in your parents fight. It's worse that this was normalized for you when you were a kid.", "I mean the adult child getting involved in the relationship and financial decisions of a married couple who are allowing her to live rent free in their home.

She doesn't know the whole story so her outburst didn't help.\n\nAlso if you live in someone house then give them the courtesy of staying out of their finances especially if you haven't spoken to both parties.", "This so much. Everyone thinks of hoarders having piles of crap and garbage everywhere, but it presents differently in people. I have family who own two fridges and keep both stuffed full of food. Plus a huge pantry. It's more than they could ever eat, and they keep it clean, but it's anxiety based. Their brother does the same thing with his old things, he just isn't a compulsive buyer.

Lot of words for something that's been said. Hence, ESH. \n\n(Also her father explicitly said the mother's spending was causing him distress and that supporting his daughter was not, they have a storage unit of junk so the daughter taking the father's side is reasonable, she. Handled. It. Wrong.)", "She had no business handling it at all. If she really wanted to get involved then she should have gotten both sides but someone venting to you isn't an invite to enter their marriage. \n\nAll she did was damage her relationship with her mom and jeopardize her living situation. Nothing in this post says dad is willing to lose his marriage for OP so if mom says either OP leaves or I do..."]}
