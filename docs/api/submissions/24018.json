He tested negative for Feline Leukemia.  \nWhile he's recovering he's supposed to be isolated to the porch. He's on pain medications and he's a little loopy.

I told him that I wished he would just leave. He said he was leaving but that I was keeping him there. I told him he has two feet and that he can go ahead and walk away. He told me I could go back into the house.\n\n  \nI told him to go. I remained where I stood.\n\n  \nMy mother was silent through this argument and only began crying at the end and wishing that I wouldn't argue with him.\n\n  \nWas I the asshole for telling him not to interfere with my animals and telling him to leave when he crossed my boundaries?", "created_utc": 1691335527, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15jsath/aita_for_telling_my_moms_bf_to_leave_my_property/", "score": 278, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
