My mother just started dating this new guy about 2 years ago. She's engaged now.\n\n  \nThis summer a stray cat showed up at my house and I began feeding him. He's a beautiful tom, black and white with a perfect white ring at the end of his otherwise black tail. I named him Frodo, for he carries the ring.  \nHe now takes daily walks with me and my two dogs. He plays with them, grooms them, rubs between my legs, comes out of the forest when I call his name.\n\n  \nThis weekend I took him to get neutered and have his shots. He tested negative for Feline Leukemia.  \nWhile he's recovering he's supposed to be isolated to the porch. He's on pain medications and he's a little loopy. He's pretty small for a tom cat, so I figure he's still rather young, most likely only a year old at most.\n\n  \nMy mother's BF is mean. He tells jokes about how he *punted* his ex-wife's cat off their porch once. He makes jabbing comments about my animals.\n\n  \nToday he stopped by the house and when he was leaving he held the porch door wide open, trying to loose my post-op drugged cat into the yard.\n\n  \nI told him no and closed the door. I told him to leave and not to interfere with the treatment of my animals. He looked at me and said, \"It's not your animal, it's just some stray. It looks fine to me.\"  \nI told him that Frodo is my cat. I have spent all summer caring for him meticulously and it should be obvious that he is MY cat. He is currently medicated and cannot be roaming loose on the pain medication.\n\n  \n(We live on a road with a lot of fast traffic and while Frodo is clever enough normally to not go in the road, I have no idea how woozy he is and how his judgement is affected by the pain medication.)\n\n  \nMy mom's BF asked me if I wanted to fight and said I was making a big deal out of it. I told him he was being a right jackass.\n\n  \nHe told me the same could be said of me.\n\n  \nHe then stood facing me, asking if I wanted to argue about it. I told him that I wished he would just leave. He said he was leaving but that I was keeping him there. I told him he has two feet and that he can go ahead and walk away. He told me I could go back into the house.\n\n  \nI told him to go. I remained where I stood.\n\n  \nMy mother was silent through this argument and only began crying at the end and wishing that I wouldn't argue with him.\n\n  \nWas I the asshole for telling him not to interfere with my animals and telling him to leave when he crossed my boundaries?", "created_utc": 1691335527, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15jsath/aita_for_telling_my_moms_bf_to_leave_my_property/", "score": 73, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
