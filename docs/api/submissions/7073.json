And it sounds like the sister could\u2019ve had intentions to manipulate you and your daughter for money. HOWEVER, your reaction is way out of line. You should\u2019ve calming called her up and told her that you misunderstood her at Christmas. Immediately yelling at someone is NEVER the answer in something as trivial as concert tickets ffs.

Your odds of buying the concert tickets for 100 bucks each are slim and none.  They will be sold out in milliseconds.

Instead of bringing it up at any time, she waited until the niece had the tickets to say word 1 about payment, and instead of discussing it with the adult, who was likely to tell her no, she pressured the child to pay. At the very least, it's ESH, and you will not change MY mind on this at all.", "Chill out, little guy. This is just Reddit.", "Not OP, my guy. Try reading comprehension?", "Am I living in some different reality here?? So if someone gives me something on Christmas Day and then comes back 2 weeks later to ask for money for it I\u2019M the AH for \u201cmaking assumptions\u201d that it was a Christmas gift???? Like wtf people can we use some common sense here please?", "Doesn\u2019t the fact that OP\u2019s sister didn\u2019t discuss money with the adults at the time enter into this? I know I wouldn\u2019t want to get a 15yo\u2019s hopes up before the deal was finalized. Instead, she gave her niece two weeks to get excited about it before mentioning money at all, and at this point OP can either pay up or be the bad guy. It\u2019s manipulative af.\n\n(Edited to remove repetitive text.)", "Or maybe her sister should make it cleat that she wants money for the tickets? This problem wouldn\u2019t be there if her sister just asked her if she wants to buy the tickets.", "Ah the good ol' ass-uming. Makes an ass out of you.", "Yea, she probably should have asked, but why would she when she told her she should sell them, and then sis turns around and gives them to niece w/o even mentioning money which is what she should when done when the tickets exchanged hands if she wanted money for them, not two weeks later.", "Sister never talked to OP about selling her the tix for her daughter. If that was her intention, sister should\u2019ve discussed that with OP BEFORE bringing it up to the daughter at all. By bringing it up to daughter directly, on Christmas, with no mention of cost, why on earth would OP not assume they were meant as a Christmas gift?? And why was sister discussing the cost with the daughter at all? That should have been clarified with OP before daughter ever even heard about it. She put daughter in an awkward and uncomfortable position rather than being up front with OP from the start.", "OP advised that she sell them on FB Marketplace, and never offered to buy them herself. Is her niece FB marketplace? Did she ask for a sum of money when she handed them over? The sister was being lazy- she didn't want to go through the trouble of selling them online, so she tried to back her sister into a corner by offering them up to her niece, thinking her sister would pony up to prevent disappointment. I also would rather buy my daughter new tickets to the same concert than reward that kind of deviousness.", "Then why go to directly to the 15yo for compensation? What 15yo has $160 laying around to spend on concert tickets? If you\u2019re not offering a gift, you ask about money up front, not two weeks after the fact. And yes, the timing of the offer relative to the holidays is absolutely relevant.", "She tried to back her sister into a corner to pay for tickets she was too lazy to sell, and I'd be ticked off, too.  She offered them to her niece with no mention of the cost- just because they'd talked about selling them before doesn't mean anything. OP never once offered to buy them from her.  I'd also buy new tickets rather than reward this behavior.", "I *think* from what I understand, it\u2019s the same price. Either way, OP is going to buy tickets. She just doesn\u2019t want to buy them from her sister because it\u2019s a \u201cshitty way to treat family\u201d", "You really have bad reading comprehension because that is not what the post says at all. It clearly outlines multiple distinct conversations that happen at separate times. First convo op with sister: talking about selling tickets. Second convo op, sister, daughter: offered tickets around Christmas. Third convo sister and daughter: sister asks for payment directly from daughter. Fourth convo op and daughter: daughter asks for money since she can't pay 160 out of pocket. Fifth convo op and sister: op asks sister what the hell she is doing. She outright says there is at least 2 weeks between offer of tickets and asking for payment.", "Ok but why wouldn't you bring up the price right away?\n\n\"Do you want tickets for this concert\"\n\n\"Do you want tickets for this concert, they are $80 apiece\"\n\nIf she intended to charge the niece, which of these two sentences should she have used to not leave any confusion or assumptions?", "Maybe the adult should be expected to make it clear, not the child ;)", "i have a good relationship with my family so i would give it to a family member for free and i know that my family would also give it to me for free. I think it it\u2019s based on how close you are with them and how your relationship is with your family. \n\nThats why i would rather say ESH. Her sister should definitely be clear that she wants money, i think OP wouldn\u2019t be that mad at her if she made that clear before and OP didn\u2019t had to overreact so much. That was unnecessary", "Maybe the sister should've made it clear they were not free when she called during the Holidays ;)\n\nCrazy folks don't always charge for their Christmas gifts, amirite?!", ">I think its super weird you are caught up on a brother telling his sister something was unacceptable\n\nDid you read what OP said? The first words out of his mouth were \"how fucking dare you.\" I don't know where you come from, but someone does that to me, and I'm hanging up and not talking to them until they apologize.\n\nWith respect to your description of the logistics, you're just wrong on the facts. Here's what OP wrote:\n\n>Cut to this week when my daughter came to me and told me that when my sister called and discussed transferring tickets (online tickets) she brought up how much she wants for them\n\nSo we're not in a situation where the niece had the tickets, now are we?\n\nSo you're entitled to vote how you'd like. But let's not pretend that your vote is informed by the facts, many of which you've ignored.", "My friend, better people have not been able to raise my heartbeat or blood pressure. This is how I have fun in between hearings.", "The point stands.", "You are living in a different reality,  because no where did it say that she gave OP the tickets on Christmas day.", "Common sense would be to not assume something is free. And common sense would be to read the entire post and realize Christmas day was never", "Just based on the OP, I think the sister assumed that OP was giving the daughter money for it.\n\nI can see how it went from -> OP recommends sister sell the tickets -> has problems selling tickets and remembers OPs child likes artists -> mentions this to OP -> OP agrees -> sister assumes that daughter could buy the originally priced tickets, so assumes she's giving her niece a big discount. \n\nTeenagers save up to buy expensive stuff all the time with birthday/gift/allowance money. \n\nShould she have worked this out with OP first? Absolutely. But it's not some crazy idea that she thought OP had already planned things out with the daughter herself.", "I agree that money should have been discussed at the start to avoid this situation", "Here's my thing yes the sister could have been clearer at the same time OP could have asked.  This was miscommunication so neither are the AH because of that. \n\nBut what makes OP an AH, at least in my book, is calling and cursing her sister out.  Instead of you know talking like an adult.", "The tickets were online, they were discussing transferring the tickets and that's when the money came up. Before OP daughter got the digital tickets. \n\nSo she did what you suggest, mentioning the price before the tickets were exchanged", "\"When she asked me if my daughter would like to go.\" Aka asked OP first before speaking with daughter about the tickets. \n\nAlso lets not forget that sometime before that OP and her sister discussed about her sister selling the tickets. So..", "Maybe she didn't have a price in mind yet? Maybe she needed to go back and double check how much she bought them for? Maybe she needed to check with her boyfriend about what price he was comfortable selling them for? Maybe she forgot about the tickets until she remember her niece liked that band too and brought up selling them on a whim? There are tons she might not have brought up the price initially.", "Just because it's shitty communication doesn't mean she has to make it a gift. Also Mom was there a non child...so what's the next reason you have? And honestly as the Mom I would have thanked my sister but offered to pay her something for the tickets anyway.", "So everything one mentions during the holidays is automatically considered a gift? \"Hey I think we are getting rid of the 2nd Porsche next year, don't think we'll be needing 2 cars really....oh you are interested?\" \"WHY DO YOU WANT US TO PAY FOR THE PORSCHE?! You called around christmas!\"", "I agree, which is why ESH other than the daughter.\n\nAunt didn't cold call the niece to try and sell them.", "I did read it, and again, she didn't discuss money with the ADULT who had it, she waited until the niece was super excited then blindsided HER. \n\n\"My daughter than asked me for $160 (80 a piece) because she obviously doesn\u2019t have that money laying around being 15 and unemployed. I told her to hold on and I\u2019ll figure this out.\"\n\nSo his sister made it seem like a gift, and knew full well she made it look like a gift, hence why she pressured a kid to give her money, instead of just asking her brother for it. Then, he calls and expresses his frustration with the underhanded attempt to manipulate the situation, knowing full well she made it seem like a gift. And apparently, because he used the word fuck you are clutching your pearls. I cant imagine you would be so up in arms if the sentence was \"how dare you\" instead of \"how fucking dare you\" so honestly, your entire judgment is based off the use  of a word not even directed AT the sister.\n\nAre you the sister? Is that why you refuse to acknowledge that she did anything wrong?  You can ignore the context of what happened all you like. I'm sorry but if you are so sensitive to swear words that you can't tell the difference between someone swearing AT you and someone swearing TO you this conversation is a moot point anyway.", "LOL is that why you delete comments little guy? It\u2019s okay :) I couldn\u2019t care less, get a better hobby hahahahaha", "She said it was over the holidays.", "I mean if you offer someone something you should make it clear that you want money for it. She asked her if her daughter wants to go, i also wouldn\u2019t think that in OPs Situation especially not after 2 weeks. I wonder why she didn\u2019t asked Op but her niece? \n\nBut yeah OP is definitely TA for being so rude. She could\u2019ve talk to her like a normal adult person.", "I agree with you about OP's behavior. I just can't get over sister offering/assuming the 15 year old had +$160. (Not to mention transportation and all the logistics necessary for a 15 year old and her friend to attend a concert. The whole thing, including the money component, should have been discussed with OP or the 15 year old's other adults first if sister was wanting to sell the tickets. Age matters here. A 15 year old simply isn't going to have the money and resources to make this happen on her own, so that brings sister's behavior into also AH area instead of just mutual miscommunication. Making the whole thing more of a ESH.\n\n(Note: I'd be with you and your reasoning if neice was an adult or even an older teen who might be more reasonably thought to have the money/resources. There's a huge difference in the money and resources a, say, 17 year old might be able to get -v- a 15 year old.", "But to bring up the payment at that point when she knew all along that she wanted money for them should have been a discussion two weeks before when she verbally offered her the tickets not when it's time to exchange tickets, because the aunt called them about the exchange, then money was brought up", "Just bc they discussed selling the tix in general doesn\u2019t mean they discussed her selling them to OP for her daughter. That is a specific conversation that should have been had directly BEFORE the concert was even brought up to the daughter. If anyone was making assumptions here it was her sister.", "If you don't care, why are you consuming so much time talking with me? As to the deleted comment, I made a mistake on the facts. So I deleted the comment and started over. The point still stands, Gulliver.", "Over the holidays is not Christmas day,  stop trying to turn something into what it's not.", "Nah the assumer was OP. OP literally admitted to assuming, \"I figured it was part of a Christmas gift.\" OP's sister never mentioned the tickets in any other context but selling them, OP's sister was consistent the whole time, OP was the one who tried to change the narrative from selling to being a gift.", "I\u2019m not? That detail changes nothing to me", "That doesn\u2019t change my point that if that was sisters intention from the beginning, the discussion of selling them to op for her daughter, and the cost associated, should have been discussed BEFORE it was brought up to the daughter. The cost never should\u2019ve been brought up to the daughter directly at all. Sister should\u2019ve handled that directly with OP from the start.", "You can feel like that was inappropriate but I don't. Nor do I think it was malicious, what's malicious is OP calling her sister to yell and curse at her. What's inappropriate is to assume you should get free things from family instead of paying for those items fairly.", "People get free things from family over the holidays all the time. The holidays are one time that I would argue you DO need to specify if you expect to be paid for something you\u2019re giving a family member, especially a child. Asking a 15 year old with no job for that much money is crazy to me but I guess that\u2019s just me apparently\u2026"]}
