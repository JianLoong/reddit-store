Anyone I've ever explained this too seems to be shocked at my reaction so I'll just get this out of the way. I have no experience with children. I've never held, talked to, or even been in the same area as a child for longer than a few minutes before this. The toddler's mother was a friend of my aunt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was outside sitting by the pool on a pool chair. At this moment pretty much everyone was inside because a game was on. I was just outside alone by the pool. I don't know how to swim but I had on trunks and enjoy putting my legs in the water. I was on my phone too so I wasn't really paying attention. From like the corner of my eye I see a toddler sprinting away but I didn't think much of it. Everyone seems to think I should see a hint of a child and immediately go into parental mode and stop the child. But my mind didn't even connect. I just continued on my phone then I heard a splash. That's when I looked and saw the kid in the deep end of the pool. I shouted that the kid fell in the pool and someone ran out, jumped in, and pulled the kid out. The kid is fine but the mother and some other people were angry at me and said I should have stopped the kid from getting in. I just said they ran in. The mother also said I should have pulled the kid out but I told her that I can't swim. She seems to think I'm some colossal asshole. It was going on and no matter what I said she would just keep cutting me off and repeat herself and was really whiny. So I just told her that I'm done talking to her. I didn't know her before the day so if this random lady thinks I'm a dick, oh well. I just got back in the chair and ignored her the rest of the day. A few other people are agreeing with her and saying \"you see a child, you just become a alert, it's natural.\" If I were walking down the road on a dark night and see a child alone. I'd stop and see to the kid. But this was a party and I didn't think the kid would just jump in. I don't really know how kids behave\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT\n\nI've received a million messages saying I should learn to swim for my own safety.  I grew up poor and never even saw a pool in person until I was like 17. There was no community pool and I'm not about to be the 25 year old in a swim class lol. I have no plans on going boating/fishing any time in life so it's all good\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT2\n\nLol all the YTA for not learning to swim. I'll take that. I'll be the asshole that never swims\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT3\n\nWant to clarify the situation in more detail. Me seeing the kid and hearing the splash was all within 10 seconds. Just saw the kid out of the corner of my eye while reading on my phone. I'm sure if I was not on my phone and saw a toddler walking around the edge of the pool I would get up and take the kid somewhere else. And as for what happened with the mother. She was scolding me for like an hour and would cut me off. Not let me speak and was being rude. She said \"I don't care if you can't swim you should have jumped in\" and I said that was ridiculous. this went on for an HOUR. I realized there was n hope in this conversation. I don't know this lady and she isn't my friend so I felt no need to make things right. Just said \"I'm not talking to you anymore. You're doing too much\" and just sat down and ignored her. She talked to me for a big more but I just ignored until she left me alone.

Being an adult also doesn't change the fact that you can't swim, so you jumping in after the kid in the deep end would've just resulted in two people needing rescuing. You immediately got the attention of someone who *could* help, that is **exactly** what you should've done.\n\nAnd the parents should be watching their kid better.

They may as well have let the kid run around outside alone in the hope someone else would keep them out of traffic.", "NTA. You shouted and don't swim. Parents should be watching their own kid. In this day and age, you could get hurt touching someone else's kid.", "NTA. \n\nYou sounded the alarm, the most you can do if you can't swim. What did they expect you to do, jump in only to drown while attempting rescue? \n\nThe mother seems to be projecting her own guilt of not watching her child onto you.", "NTA.

You did the right thing by screaming for help \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA\n\nIt's not like you ignored the kid when he fell in. You shouted for help, and help came. Since you can't swim, jumping in yourself would have just required *you* to be rescued along with the kid.\n\nIt really isn't your fault the kid ran into the pool.\n\nThe fact that the parents had to be *told* the kid fell into the pool shows that they were not paying close enough attention to him. That is, probably *nobody* could have *prevented* his running into the pool, but the parents should have had a close enough eye on him that they observed it themselves.", "NTA. \nWhy wasn't the parent (or any other parent) aware of the location of a roaming toddler while at a house with a pool?

I can't tell you how many times I had to tell parents at the pools I worked at that they *did not* want their child to have my undivided attention because that would mean their child needed rescue.", "NTA.  You raised the alarm which did save the kid.  The parents just know they screwed up and want to deflect the blame to you.", "NTA and I say this as a mother of small children.

This cute notion that all people should go into parenting mode is just fantasy.

So you would have had the chance to decline (because valid boundaries!) and then she could have found another solution. Yes, it could have been a tragic accident. Yes, you could have been a hero. But of you don't have that automatic \"protect the child\" reaction? Maybe you're also too young to have it?", "NTA copium from the parents who were actually supposed to be watching the kid.

Kids do stupid stuff all the time, nobody can avoid everything that could endangere the child. Imo you did the best you could. You saw a child in danger and called for help. It would be highly unwise to go into the pool yourself if you can't swim. I think it's an emotional immature behaviour of the mother to tell you, you should have behaved otherwise. If the mother (or the parents) stop watching their child near a dangerous environment (like the an open pool), the least they could do is ask someone to watch over the kid.

My mom is. Its why we all had to learn how to swim. (A playmate drowned when she was very young and my mama ain't even getting near the water after that trauma.) Back to reality. People who don't swim, don't rescue other people from the water. And I know plenty of grown folks who know how to bathe themselves, but don't know how to swim. They don't give a toot that they can't swim either. (More than half of Americans can't swim well enough to save themselves from drowning. So, its not like EVERYBODY who breathes air and drives a car or rides a bike can swim. C'mon.) \n\nAnd now to the nitty gritty: Someone left the sliding glass doors to the lanai open a bit and my cousin's baby crawled outside, fell into the pool and nearly died. She has brain damage, and many other difficulties as a result. Their home had no less than 6 grown people in it when this happened. And everyone thought that someone else was looking after the baby. \n\nSo, I'd have drowned with the baby if I saw the toddler running toward the pool. And everyone on earth should be mindful of defenseless children. Letting our guards down can result in tragedy. Just sayin'.

A lot of places allow the fence to go all the way to the house as long as you put an alarm on your glass sliding doors to alert people when someone goes outside into the pool area. If they were having a pool party, and they have that setup (which is super, super common), they may well have left the door open to keep the alarm from going off all the time. Even if they didn't, the alarm would be meaningless if lots of people were regularly going in and out of the pool area \n\nThe real trick, I think, is to not allow small kids at a mostly adult pool party.
