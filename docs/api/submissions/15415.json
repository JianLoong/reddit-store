Anyone I've ever explained this too seems to be shocked at my reaction so I'll just get this out of the way. I have no experience with children. I've never held, talked to, or even been in the same area as a child for longer than a few minutes before this. The toddler's mother was a friend of my aunt.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI was outside sitting by the pool on a pool chair. At this moment pretty much everyone was inside because a game was on. I was just outside alone by the pool. I don't know how to swim but I had on trunks and enjoy putting my legs in the water. I was on my phone too so I wasn't really paying attention. From like the corner of my eye I see a toddler sprinting away but I didn't think much of it. Everyone seems to think I should see a hint of a child and immediately go into parental mode and stop the child. But my mind didn't even connect. I just continued on my phone then I heard a splash. That's when I looked and saw the kid in the deep end of the pool. I shouted that the kid fell in the pool and someone ran out, jumped in, and pulled the kid out. The kid is fine but the mother and some other people were angry at me and said I should have stopped the kid from getting in. I just said they ran in. The mother also said I should have pulled the kid out but I told her that I can't swim. She seems to think I'm some colossal asshole. It was going on and no matter what I said she would just keep cutting me off and repeat herself and was really whiny. So I just told her that I'm done talking to her. I didn't know her before the day so if this random lady thinks I'm a dick, oh well. I just got back in the chair and ignored her the rest of the day. A few other people are agreeing with her and saying \"you see a child, you just become a alert, it's natural.\" If I were walking down the road on a dark night and see a child alone. I'd stop and see to the kid. But this was a party and I didn't think the kid would just jump in. I don't really know how kids behave\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT\n\nI've received a million messages saying I should learn to swim for my own safety.  I grew up poor and never even saw a pool in person until I was like 17. There was no community pool and I'm not about to be the 25 year old in a swim class lol. I have no plans on going boating/fishing any time in life so it's all good", "created_utc": 1682172727, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12v73a4/aita_for_not_preventing_a_toddler_from_running/", "score": 867, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Most people tend to assume that because there's more people around, less risk of drowning. But what actually happens is everyone assumes someone else is watching the kids when in fact *no one* is watching them.\n\nJust because you were in the pool area doesn't mean you could've been fast enough to stop the kid from getting in the water. Being an adult also doesn't change the fact that you can't swim, so you jumping in after the kid in the deep end would've just resulted in two people needing rescuing. You immediately got the attention of someone who *could* help, that is **exactly** what you should've done.\n\nAnd the parents should be watching their kid better.

They may as well have let the kid run around outside alone in the hope someone else would keep them out of traffic.", "NTA. You shouted and don't swim. Parents should be watching their own kid. In this day and age, you could get hurt touching someone else's kid.", "NTA. \n\nYou sounded the alarm, the most you can do if you can't swim. What did they expect you to do, jump in only to drown while attempting rescue? \n\nThe mother seems to be projecting her own guilt of not watching her child onto you.", "NTA.

You did the right thing by screaming for help \ud83d\udc4d", "NTA\n\nIt's not like you ignored the kid when he fell in. You shouted for help, and help came. Since you can't swim, jumping in yourself would have just required *you* to be rescued along with the kid.\n\nIt really isn't your fault the kid ran into the pool.\n\nThe fact that the parents had to be *told* the kid fell into the pool shows that they were not paying close enough attention to him. That is, probably *nobody* could have *prevented* his running into the pool, but the parents should have had a close enough eye on him that they observed it themselves.", "NTA. \nWhy wasn't the parent (or any other parent) aware of the location of a roaming toddler while at a house with a pool?

I can't tell you how many times I had to tell parents at the pools I worked at that they *did not* want their child to have my undivided attention because that would mean their child needed rescue.", "NTA.

This cute notion that all people should go into parenting mode is just fantasy.

So you would have had the chance to decline (because valid boundaries!) and then she could have found another solution. Yes, it could have been a tragic accident. Yes, you could have been a hero. But of you don't have that automatic \"protect the child\" reaction? Maybe you're also too young to have it?", "NTA copium from the parents who were actually supposed to be watching the kid.

Kids do stupid stuff all the time, nobody can avoid everything that could endangere the child. Imo you did the best you could. You saw a child in danger and called for help. It would be highly unwise to go into the pool yourself if you can't swim. I think it's an emotional immature behaviour of the mother to tell you, you should have behaved otherwise. If the mother (or the parents) stop watching their child near a dangerous environment (like the an open pool), the least they could do is ask someone to watch over the kid.

I swear this sub gets off on absolving people of doing the literal bare minimum.\n\nIt would have taken all of 60 seconds to see the kid go grab kid and take them inside.\n\nOh no OP would be pulled away from 60 seconds of precious screen time on their phone! The horror!", "There\u2019s no need to be embarrassed plenty of people have learnt to swim as adults, many much older than you. Why should you be embarrassed for trying to learn new skills just because you \u201cshould\u201d have learnt as a child? Not being able to swim as an adult isn\u2019t your failing, it\u2019s just that you didn\u2019t have the opportunity. You shouldn\u2019t limit yourself because of embarrassment. And if you did want to learn you would participate in adult swim classes.", "They have adult swim classes \ud83d\ude0a you are never too old to learn something new!", "I know some who learned at 50. They have adult only classes.", "Yep. As a 7 year old I fished my 18 month old cousin out of the pool. I was in the pool, he was near the edge, the adults were doing whatever they were doing. When I put him back on the edge he was crying and I got in trouble for splashing him. It was only hours later that one of the adults realised that when I said \"I got John out of the pool\" that meant that he was *in* the pool at some point.\n\nThe fights among the adults was epic (in hindsight) because they were all trying to blame each other without alerting my grandparents that it had happened (my grandparents were sticklers for water safety).", "Right!

What a ride.", "And not just social functions but restaurants, stores, parks, etc", "Those parents are very clearly the AH and trying to deflect attention from their terrible parenting now that it\u2019s been brought to light. Letting a child near a pool unsupervised is straight up neglect. And OP hadn\u2019t been asked to supervise. OP could as well have been inside using the bathroom or getting a drink when the kid ran over and fell in the pool. \n\nI still think that OP should make an effort to learn how to swim since it\u2019s an important life skill but they are obviously not an AH for it. There are adult swim classes and 1 on 1 lessons if you\u2019re embarrassed", "I would have reported that so called mother... That's awful.

I\u2019m sure if OP could swim they\u2019d have fished the toddler out, but obviously since they couldn\u2019t, and it was the deep end, they went for the next best solution, which was calling people who could.

They had no way of knowing if the people who heard them would be fast enough, though.", "okay, while water wings are better than nothing btw, why not life vests ? as a kid i always wore either or around water until i was old enough to hold myself above the water level", "Please explain to me what the deep end of the pool means to you, because in my world, an adult in no way has to be \"saved\" from a pool unless they're injured/otherwise incapacitated.", "But you kind of do? You have to be able to tread water while lifting 30lbs, which is difficult in deep water with no swimming skills. How was OP to know that the kids parents were being negligent and not taking care of their kid?", "Your circles are entitled people then. As a parent, you shouldn't assume that other people are watching your child at any point unless they've agreed to do so. People at social events are socializing. It's extremely stupid to assume that everyone else is keeping an eye on your kid while they're trying to relax and have fun. \n\nThat's why babysitters are usually paid. People don't want to deal with someone else's kids because the parents are entitled and don't want to watch them.\n\nOP did know that a toddler jumping into a pool is bad news, which is why he got help when it happened.", "But OP did know a toddler jumping into the pool was a problem and dealt with it and the toddler is safe. I don't understanding hating on them for not predicting it would happen and preventing it.\n\nAlso, in my family the parents  1) ensure someone in the general area is responsible for the kid and 2) let that person know they will be the only adult in the area or ask if they mind being the main child person before abdicating the main responsibility for the child. This post is the perfect example of why thinking \"Surely someone at this gathering will watch without me checking in!\" doesn't work.\n\nThe child was at a gathering full of trusted adults and still almost drowned. It was basically pure chance that OP happened to be outside when no one else was. The parents assumed that everyone would in general keep an eye on their kid, it didn't need to be in their line of sight, and no one did. The kid went outside without a single adult in the house noticing and if not for OP being there to notice the kid could have died.\n\nEveryone at the party let the kid slip outside and would have let the kid drown if OP hadn't raised the alarm. Why is OP the only one whose actions are a problem? It's not their kid. If OP had just been a random partygoer, inside with everyone else, and not been the one to raise the alarm, who would everyone be blaming when the kid was found floating dead? Everyone here would be saying things like \"What kind of mother lets their kid out of their sight near a pool? She was watching the game on TV and let her child die! I have my kids on a leash when there are puddles from rain outside, it's neglect not to!\"\n\n But because OP happened to be in closer proximity, in your opinion THEY were the one who didn't do enough. How is that fair?\n\nEdited right after posting for clarity.", "Also a good wake up call to make sure that the child's parents are watching him and get consent from somebody before assuming that they are going to watch him for them.", "Or you know, just sit there and go \"Hey sweetie, does your mommy know you are here? Where's mommy?\"", "My brother pulled my out of the deep end while my family partied around the pool, I was 2.5 and no one heard me slip into the water, I was at the bottom of the deep end.", "Similar ages I pulled my sister out of the pool when she jumped in, but my mom *was* watching and reacted immediately. So she jumped in fully clothed while I was pulling my sister out.", "Trauma is the mother of lessons.\n\nIt's funny - in a sad way - because the kid that died at 7 in my familly was from the fault of no one, and certainly not from lack of supervision.\n\n He was 7.

Always an obedient child.\n\nWhy that day he decided to shot up into traffic? He must have seen something, but what ? We will never know.

All of a sudden the child pitched forward and I managed to catch her (wrenching my back) just before her head hit the floor. The mother just glared at me angrily, did not thank me, shoved the child back in the cart and pulled it closer so that I could not \"accost\" her child again.

You can't prevent every accident (those little beggars are fast) but you can certainly most.", "It's entirely feasible that he could have dove in to save the child, and they both drown before any other adults arrived. His actions are the most logical and you're just being difficult.", "Right, but they can't swim so what do you want them to do? They never signed on to be in charge of watching the kids, they had no idea that was a responsibility they had been given.

In a private pool? 2 m? So that's a couple of centimeters over a full grown adult's head, I think you'd be able to do that with just pushing yourself off the ground.", "Hm, nah. I just happen to know people who believe in supporting each other and not letting kids drown/jump off a cliff/eat poison/whatever.\n\nBabysitting, as in being the only adult around and actively engaging with kids for hours is VERY different from pulling your four year old nephew away from the fire he was going to run into before you go back to eating your steak or whatever.", "Nobody is claiming OP is the only problem?\n\nBut it IS a problem that OP a) saw a child sprinting towards the pool and neither said or did anything and b) when that kid fell into the pool went \"hey maybe check out this situation\" instead of ACTIVELY DOING SOMETHING about it.", "Yes, and if the parents were the ones who made this post, that's what they would hear.", "\u201cAt the moment pretty much everyone was inside because a game was on\u201d\n\nThis tells me OP knew there weren\u2019t a bunch of others around", "None of this came to mind.

Also this all happened in a span of like 10 seconds", "You mean not perfect in the way of letting your child die?", "I'm the parent that ends up watching a ton of kids once the other parents have fucked off.\n\nIt's quite annoying and I rarely get to enjoy myself at events because there's a bunch of 2-10 year olds being left to their own devices.", "Again, OP is an adult without any injuries/incapacitating circumstances, as far as we know. HOW would they drown in a private pool.", "Yes, they should have. But they weren't. \nSo, as an adult who's close by and who sees the kid jumping in, you jump after them and pull them out.", "That's... Max twice the height even of a small person?

He yelled for help instead of reacting rashly and very likely increasing the number of people needing help. \n\nIf your kid gets hurt or ends up in danger at a social gathering, it is YOUR fault as a parent. No one else's. Don't assume people are watching your child at any point unless you've asked them and they've said yes.\nIf you're at a party and you're eyeing other people's kids the whole time, you're the weird one.

It seems like there wasn't time for OP to intervene- they first noticed the child sprinting past and then it went straight into the pool. OP did not sit as the child ran in circles around the pool before diving in. By the time their brain fully recognized there was a child present it was in the pool. Do you have a radar sense for the presence of children so that one could never sprint past you? \n\nAfter it went into the pool, OP CANNOT SWIM and the child was IN THE DEEP END. Calling people actually capable of \"actively doing something about it\" was all OP could do without doubling the amount of people needing to be rescued from drowning.", "If you want to be responsible for other peoples kids, that's your prerogative. It doesn't make someone an asshole to not want to deal with other people's children.", "You realize that OP typed this after the event in question, right?

People panic in those situations and they do not have the reflexes or muscle memory to keep their heads above the water when their lungs fill with water. People can drown in shallow water easily, and children often drown in mere inches where they should've been able to just lift their heads out. If the water is deeper than one can stand, then non swimmers often kick and flail and actually push themselves further underwater.", "Oh so you\u2019re just an idiot. Glad we cleared that up", "That doesn't help at all? \n\nMe either. I don't know where I implied a public pool.", "My bad, I assumed that since OP didn't mention being at a millionaire's house, we're talking about normal human dimensions.", "If someone is that terrified of water, that definitely seems like something to seek help with.", "Yuuup. The worst kind, too.", "I would assume being able to breathe does help most people survive, but what do I know.\n\n\"there are plenty of pools deeper than 10ft.\" \nYeah. People pay to swim there and thus, they are able to pay someone to stop people from drowning."]}
